<TEXT>
<P>
Falling in Love (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) is a handsome if conventional 
1984 variation of "Brief Encounter" starring Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep as 
suburban Manhattanites married to others who become involved in spite of 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Who Gets the Friends? (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a painfully misfired 1988 TV 
movie comedy about a divorcing couple (Jill Clayburgh, James Farentino). 
</P>
<P>
The outrageously entertaining -- in all possible meanings of the phrase -- Mad 
Max Beyond Thunderdome (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) takes us far, far past the 
Apocalypse and into a chaotic arena where combatants battle tooth and claw. Mel 
Gibson again plays the heroic loner; Tina Turner is the dynamic villainess. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 TV movie Love Among Thieves (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is an old-fashioned 
adventure starring Audrey Hepburn as a wealthy concert pianist caught up in a 
perils-of-Pauline journey, during which she encounters a mysterious Robert 
Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Roeg's 1985 Insignificance (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is a 
pretentious, talky concoction which brings together four unnamed but easily 
identifiable '50s icons -- Marilyn Monroe (Theresa Russell), Joe DiMaggio (Gary 
Busey), Albert Einstein (Michael Emil) and Joseph McCarthy (Tony Curtis) -- on 
a sweltering night in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Gena Rowlands' Emmy-winning portrayal in the title role of The Betty Ford Story 
(ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) is the best reason by far for catching this 1987 TV 
movie. Josef Sommer and Nan Woods co-star. 
</P>
<P>
Don't let your daughter grow up to be a drug-addicted porn star. That's about 
the only point of the 1988 TV movie Shattered Innocence (CBS Tuesday at 9 
p.m.), an example of how TV can strip a sensational true story of its 
complexities and power. 
</P>
<P>
Cross My Heart (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 8 p.m.) is 
a well-intended 1987 romantic comedy that doesn't quite jell; Martin Short and 
Annette O'Toole play a pair of star-crossed daters. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 satire of Los Angeles, consumer culture and modern dating, You Can't 
Hurry Love (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 5 p.m.), tries 
to have it both ways, simultaneously damning contemporary hedonism and 
wallowing in it. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 tale of infidelity A Change of Seasons (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) 
exploits rather than satirizes contemporary sexual mores. Among the victims: 
Shirley Mac-Laine, Bo Derek and Anthony Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
The unintentionally campy Tarzan, the Ape Man (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.), in 
which Miles O'Keeffe and Bo Derek vie for best chest honors amid hilarious 
dialogue and predicaments, also boasts a gloriously hammy turn by Richard 
Harris as Bo's father. 
</P>
<P>
Night Walk (CBS Friday at 9 p.m.) is a trite 1989 TV movie in which police 
lieutenant Robert Urich falls for the gorgeous witness (Lesley-Anne Down) he is 
protecting.

Mayim Bialik is one of the most talented young actresses on television today. 
The pilot episode of NBC's "Blossom" was excellent. And what a treat to watch 
the Fox comedy "Molloy."

WATCHING THE WORKING CLASS

Workers of the world -- at least those who own a VCR -- unite. Celebrate Labor 
Day this year with an appropriate home video. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of films touch on the life and times of the American labor movement. A 
good place to start is with two dynamic portrayals of two hard-working stiffs 
as different as night and day: Marlon Brando's poor waterfront roustabout and 
Sally Field's poor Southern textile worker. 
</P>
<P>
"On the Waterfront" (1954, 108 minutes, RCA/Columbia Pictures tape and laser 
video disc) is Budd Schulberg's brutally raw account of New York harbor unions. 
</P>
<P>
This Academy Award-winning film (eight Oscars including best picture) boasts 
one of the most impressive casts ever assembled for a motion picture: the 
unforgettable Marlon Brando as the average Joe who finally takes on a corrupt 
labor boss (Lee J. Cobb in one of his nastiest portrayals); Rod Steiger as 
Brando's brother (to whom ex-boxer Brando moans in one of the film's most 
lampooned scenes, "Charlie, oh Charlie, you don't understand. I coulda had 
class. I coulda been a contenduh"); Eva Marie Saint as his innocent girlfriend 
and Karl Malden as the frustrated priest. They were directed by Elia Kazan in 
his prime, with powerful music by Leonard Bernstein and stunning 
black-and-white cinematography by Boris Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
"Norma Rae" (1979, 113 minutes, CBS/Fox Home Video tape and laser video disc) 
makes any viewer want to stand up and shout for workers' rights. Ron Leibman 
offers a realistic portrait of a New York labor organizer who cares more about 
the cause than the people in that cause, who recruits Sally Field and shepherds 
her into the fight against management. 
</P>
<P>
Field offers a sympathetic portrait of a woman fighting for what she believes 
is right against almost impossible odds, both in the factory and at home. 
</P>
<P>
Both this Martin Ritt film and the Kazan film are perfect for the small screen 
because they focus on human relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"Blue Collar" (1978, 114 minutes, MCA tape and laser video disc) is a blunt 
look at assembly-line worker oppression. Integrated into a muckraking melodrama 
involving three car factory workers who finally resort to robbery, "Blue 
Collar" is a gutsy look at union and management, each ripping off the union 
worker who is caught in the middle. Paul Schrader overdirected this ripe 
melodrama. Richard Pryor, Harvey Keitel and Yaphet Kotto give first-rate 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
"F.I.S.T." (1978, 145 minutes, CBS-Fox tape and laser video disc) is Norman 
Jewison's well-intentioned, well-produced story of the rise and fall of a union 
boss. But this ambitious portrait of a Jimmy Hoffa-like labor leader isn't 
helped much by Sylvester Stallone's one-dimensional performance. Peter Boyle 
shows what the film could have been in his role as a Teamster boss. 
</P>
<P>
"Black Fury" (1935, 92 minutes, Key Video tape) is a dated yet still effective 
picture about strikes, with Paul Muni as a coal miner who champions safe 
working conditions as he goes up against union corruption. 
</P>
<P>
If all of this is too serious for you on a day of rest, then try the lighter 
side of the working class. "9 to 5" (1980, 11O minutes, CBS-Fox tape and laser 
video disc) is the working woman's revenge on an insufferably pompous male 
boss. Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda are the three office women who 
plot to get rid of Dabney Coleman. Director Colin Higgins mixes a rich blend of 
fantasy and reality, throwing in some sage office politics and morality. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pajama Game" (1964, 85 minutes, Warner tape and laser video disc) is the 
dazzling 1957 Broadway musical screen version of workers in a pajama factory 
who demand a pay raise. Doris Day and John Raitt are symbols of labor and 
management, and their love-hate relationship seems appropriate. But it's the 
songs that make the film memorable, including "Hey, There" and "Steam Heat." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm All Right, Jack" (1960, 104 minutes, British, HBO tape) is the classic 
1959 British satire on labor-management relations in England. Peter Sellers' 
labor leader will be a familiar figure to anyone working on either side of the 
Atlantic. The cast is in top form: Terry-Thomas, Richard Attenborough, Ian 
Carmichael and Margaret Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
Two more films, each more than a half-century old, are so funny they just might 
remind you that things may not have changed that much after all. Rene Clair's 
1931 "A Nous la Liberte" (87 minutes, Hollywood Home Theater tape) is a classic 
satire on industrialization and the machine age. It was one of the inspirations 
for Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times" (1936, 89 minutes, Playhouse tape and 
disc) in which an assembly line worker goes berserk. This was actually 
Chaplin's last silent film with music and sound effects added. It's an attack 
on the machine age many workers still will appreciate.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: LOWERING THE VOLUMES; 
</P>
<P>
DISCARDING BOOKS, EVEN THOSE UNREAD ODDITIES, CAN BE A TROUBLESOME CHORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
AS OUR REMODELING project continues, and the time draws near when I will have 
to move out of my old study into my new one, I am trying to lighten ship. I 
have been weeding out my collection of 2,000 or 3,000 books. 
</P>
<P>
It is very hard to discard a book, no matter how dull, esoteric or out-of-date 
it may be. I have, for example, several collections of trivia, which, by 
definition, is of little value. But who knows when I might need a bit of 
trivia. 
</P>
<P>
One must beware of discarding books that have been autographed to oneself, 
personally, by their authors. Several times I have tossed a book, only to 
retrieve it, look inside and find that, yes, it was autographed. "To Jack 
Smith, with best wishes," or something more sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
I am planning to give the books to a local Friends of the Library group, for 
its book sale, and there is always a danger that someone will buy an 
autographed book and notify its author that it was picked up for 50 cents at a 
book sale. 
</P>
<P>
I remember my chagrin a few years ago when a reader wrote to tell me that he 
had borrowed one of my books from a library and found that I had autographed it 
for Herb Caen, the San Francisco Chronicle columnist. I wondered how the book 
had traveled from Caen's office to a local library and decided to phone him and 
ask. He said, "It must have been my ex-wife," an explanation which I regarded 
as an obvious evasion. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest thing is throwing out books one has loved. I decided to get rid of 
my entire collections of Robert Nathan, H. Allen Smith and Peter De Vries. 
Nathan was a friend of mine, and his novels were enchanting. Smith and De Vries 
were surely two of our funniest humorists. 
</P>
<P>
One parts with humor reluctantly. But I have read all those books at least 
twice, and I feel that they will do more good if they are spread around, so 
that people who have never read them can discover them. 
</P>
<P>
My Smith books -- almost his entire output -- are autographed by the man 
himself, but not to me. They were all autographed to his friend Fred Beck, who 
used to write a Farmers Market column for The Times. Beck called me one day and 
asked me to meet him on the Malibu pier. I did as he asked. It was a mystical 
experience. The pier was shrouded in fog. Beck and I had never met, but we 
recognized each other instantly. He asked me to pull my car up alongside his. 
We transferred the entire collection of autographed Smith books from his car to 
mine. 
</P>
<P>
Like Beck, I have found that it's time to pass Smith on. So farewell to "Life 
in a Putty Knife Factory," "Low Man on the Totem Pole" and "Lost in the Horse 
Latitudes." I hope someone else enjoys them as much as I did. 
</P>
<P>
Though a dark streak underlies his work, as it does most humor, Peter De Vries 
is the funniest of modern novelists. I invite you to read "Comfort Me With 
Apples," "The Tunnel of Love" or "The Mackerel Plaza." It is with regret that I 
know I will never read them again. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, I am discarding books in which I have no interest whatever. I don't 
even know how I acquired them, and I can't see why anyone else would buy them. 
But of course there's no accounting for tastes. 
</P>
<P>
One of these anomalies is "The Hog Book" (Doubleday) by William Hedgepeth. The 
title is not a joke. The book is about hogs. The history, myth and mystique of 
hogs. It is dedicated "to the millions of porkers who have gone to their final 
resting place inside us." 
</P>
<P>
After tossing it I retrieved it for another look. The chapters included "Hogs 
in Love," "Swine in Art, Sport and Show Biz," "Pig Poetry," "Hoglore" and 
"Immanent Divinity." There is nothing in this world that isn't interesting. 
</P>
<P>
I also have a book on bats, but I'm not giving that away. I am fascinated by 
bats, and I suspect that, like hogs, they are sadly misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
I am also tossing a few antiques. One of them is "In Pastures New," by George 
Ade (published in 1906). Like me, Ade was a newspaper columnist, and, as I 
sometimes do, he tried to be funny. But, alas, I'm afraid his new pastures are 
old today. His first chapter is called "Getting Acquainted with the English 
Language"; he notes that American English and English English are two different 
languages. He recalls seeing a sign in a Paris shop that said, "English spoken 
-- American understood." Seems to me I've written about that subject many times 
-- speaking about old pastures. 
</P>
<P>
I've decided to keep "The Hog Book." I'm sure there are things about hogs that 
I ought to know.

OUTTAKES: WHERE FUR ART THOU? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Steven Spielberg and Andrew Lloyd Webber may have plans to turn the musical 
"Cats" into an animated film, but two lesser-knowns already have a jump on 
those two entertainment fat cats. Not only a jump -- they used real felines. 
</P>
<P>
For an all-cat version of "Romeo * Juliet"( no less. 
</P>
<P>
Brussels-based P.H. Consulting and L.A.-based Moonseed Prods. produced the 
film, which premieres Thursday at the Venice Film Festival (no U.S. distributor 
yet). Loosely based on William Shakespeare's drama, it's played as a ballet, 
utilizing the music of Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet" ballet as performed by 
the London Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Andre Previn. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there is one human character amid the furry cast -- actor John Hurt 
in drag as "La Dame aux Chats," a Venetian bag lady. Moved by Romeo and 
Juliet's plight, she transports them to the New World, where Romeo, a smoky, 
long-haired gray, and Juliet, a cloud-white Turkish Angora, are free to 
purr-sue their romance in peace. 
</P>
<P>
Director Armando Acosta kept Shakespeare's famous balcony scene in the script 
-- sort of. Acosta shot it atop the Cyclone roller coaster at Coney Island. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was one more detail that gave us pause: "The cats themselves do 
not speak," said a press release. Were they expected to? 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman explained that such stellar British actors as Maggie Smith, Ben 
Kingsley and Vanessa Redgrave convey the cats' thoughts in voiceovers. David J.

AMERICAN ICONS IN WATERCOLOR

<TEXT>
<P>
FOR MANY, the term sport art is oxymoronic. Apart from the rare "Discus 
Thrower," athletics doesn't seem to inspire fine art that pleases both critics 
and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
But now sports and art lovers with refined sensibilities can indulge their 
passions at the Sports and Entertainment Gallery in Venice. Particularly 
noteworthy among the gallery's current offerings is the work of local artist 
and inveterate baseball fan, Robert Myers. 
</P>
<P>
Myers relies on his eclectic assortment of late-'50s/early-'60s baseball cards 
as inspiration for his large watercolor portraits (which sell for $1,500 to 
$5,000). "I'm not a baseball-card collector," he insists. "I'm interested in 
them only from an artistic perspective. Unlike today's cards, which are bland 
portraiture, the older versions are not photorealism but neo-pop art. They are 
American icons." He is attracted to a card primarily by the player's apparent 
attitude. "I want a subject who knows he's being viewed. I look for that 
confrontational, dramatic moment that's shared among the subject, the painter 
and the viewer."

STAGE WEEK: CARTWRIGHT'S 'ROAD' LEADS TO THE GREAT OUTDOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The courtyard adjacent to Stages Theatre in Hollywood becomes a lonely British 
streetscape in Jim Cartwright's "Road" (1986), opening this weekend. "I've seen 
it performed all over the world, but it's never been done outdoors before," the 
British playwright said admiringly. "The audience sits on one side; on the left 
side is the 'road,' on the right side is this sort of demolished wall -- and 
you can look into the rooms inside." 
</P>
<P>
The entire action takes place on a single night on a Lancashire road, the 
poorest street in a district stricken with unemployment. "A character named 
Scullery is the guide-narrator," explained Cartwright, 32. "He takes you 
through the dangerous parts, the safe parts, tells you stories. The audience 
gets to peep into these peoples' lives, see how they tick. It's sort of as if 
you walked along the street yourself, listening through the windows and getting 
snatches of conversations." 
</P>
<P>
Seven actors play the 25-plus characters -- among them, young lovers Joey and 
Claire, a skinhead who's turned to Buddhism, "a lonely woman who found a 
soldier and takes him back to her place to find a bit of happiness, and a 
50-ish guy questioning why he's on the scrap heap now: no job, no money." 
Cartwright, who originally wrote the piece for London's Royal Court Theatre 
(where it has been revived twice), acknowledges there are political overtones, 
"but mostly these are just people everyone can relate to." 
</P>
<P>
MOMMIE DEAREST: Salome Jens dons an unpopular character -- the tyrannical, 
self-involved, money-grubbing, social-climbing mother -- in Strindberg's "The 
Pelican," at 2nd Stage in Hollywood. "The play isn't done very often," noted 
Jens, "probably because it's not easy to do. I've spoken to some actresses who 
didn't think they were healthy enough to play the part. You have to be strong 
to put up with an audience's upset with the character." 
</P>
<P>
Her crime? "She came from meager beginnings, and wanted to move into a place of 
respect. So her relationships became about money, potentiality, trying to 
survive the creative needs she had. She's terrified of being poor, of being 
bereft of anything beautiful. And she has neglected her two children in that 
need for position, love, money. But she's also a human being who pays a price 
for her blindness; she pays a price for her children's pain." 
</P>
<P>
The actress described the turn-of-the-century work as "a play of diminishing 
options. We now know how moving into new (behavior) is possible. But then the 
past was the present -- and the future."

ALLA BREVE: SCHUBERT: THE SINGERS AND ALL THE SONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Schubert wrote 600-plus songs for solo voice and piano, and Hyperion -- a 
small, classy British company that has to date specialized in Baroque repertory 
-- is planning to record every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
It is up to volume seven -- about a fifth of the project -- so a progress 
report is in order. 
</P>
<P>
The driving force of the series is British pianist-scholar Graham Johnson, who 
is the accompanist throughout, a function he fulfills with fluency, 
intelligence and, when required, drama. The singers are mostly Britishers, of 
varying degrees of renown, with a couple of ringers, Janet Baker and Elly 
Ameling. 
</P>
<P>
The seven individual CDs are valuable, at the very least as reference sources. 
Whether the deep-dyed lieder buff will respond with enthusiasm is another 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
The first and seventh volumes are required listening. No. 1 (Hyperion 33001) 
offers 19 songs to texts of Goethe and Schiller, some familiar, such as "Nahe 
des Geliebten," "Wonne der Wehmut" and "Erster Verlust," most less so and 
hardly the less compelling for that, particularly in performances of such 
verbal point and canny vocalism as that of Janet Baker, an ageless marvel. 
</P>
<P>
Ameling's program (33007) treats largely intimate, unfamiliar settings of 
little-known poets -- songs that do not tax the soprano's current vocal 
resources yet allow her to share with us the accumulated wisdom of more than 
three decades of performing masterfully both the core components and byways of 
the art-song repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Best of the less familiar singers is Stephen Varcoe, whose youthful, light 
baritone and keen intelligence are applied to songs dealing with things 
aquatic: rivers, ships, fishermen. Outstanding are the gentle "Am Bach im 
Fruhling" (an old Hans Hotter specialty) and the somber "Auf der Donau" 
(33002). 
</P>
<P>
The programs assigned to tenor Philip Langridge (33004) and his wife, mezzo Ann 
Murray (33003), are problematic. 
</P>
<P>
Langridge, a fine vocal actor, particularly in 20th-Century repertory, has a 
voice that shatters under pressure, most notably in such dramatic fare as 
"Nachtstuck," which is also taken far too slowly for his -- or our -- comfort, 
and the passionate "Liebesrauch" which requires a firmer instrument than his. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, for her part, is a placid, monochromatic interpreter of such wonders as 
the grotesque "Der Zwerg" and the magically evocative -- in other hands -- 
"Nacht und Traume." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Rolfe Johnson, one of today's indispensable Bach, Handel and Britten 
tenors, has the physical equipment for his music (on 33006) but is short of the 
requisite temperament, particularly for the likes of "Wilkommen und Abschied." 
Rolfe Johnson's sweet-toned, fussy crooning simply emasculates the music. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Connell's big, windblown soprano is all wrong for Schubert's 
intimacies, of which there are several examples in her program (33005). Yet it 
is she who delivers some of the series' memorable moments when matched with the 
composer's most dramatic songs, the sort of stuff that does not sound out of 
place in the mouth of a Wagnerian: "Die Allmacht" and "Dem Unendlichen." 
</P>
<P>
More about Hyperion's Schubert in a future column. 
</P>
<P>
There are three new recorded interpretations, all from German singers, of 
Schubert's great, glum "Winterreise" cycle: baritone Olaf Bar, bass Michael 
Schopper (BMG/Deutsche Harmonia Mubndi 77055) and mezzo-soprano Brigitte 
Fassbaender (EMI/Angel 49846). 
</P>
<P>
Bar may be the most accomplished of today's younger German lieder singers and 
he is in peak form here, delivering with his finely-tuned, middleweight 
instrument a dramatic interpretation, in conjunction with Geoffrey Parsons' 
strongly supportive pianism. 
</P>
<P>
Schopper, with his darkish, well-controlled instrument, presents a fast-paced, 
low-key but not inexpressive interpretation. Andreas Staier, his accompanist -- 
on the fortepiano -- is, however, a bit of a stick. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran Fassbaender knows her stuff, has a strong, secure voice and enjoys 
the powerful collaboration of pianist Aribert Reimann. But poet Wilhelm Muller 
and Schubert in their "Winterreise" expressed, in the first person, the 
thoughts of a man, which Fassbaender most emphatically is not.

*** 1/2 JANE'S ADDICTION "RITUAL DE LO HABITUAL" WARNER BROS.: ALBUMS ARE RATED 
ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC). 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As film buffs await the newest from Kubrick and lit buffs the latest from 
Mailer, certain underground-rock fans look forward to a new release from Jane's 
Addiction -- one of the very few groups capable of recording the Great American 
Album. And just as surely are they disappointed when it falls short. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it's the very unapproachability of the Big One that makes it such a 
tantalizing ideal. And Jane's, who toy artily with the boundaries of rock but 
also play riffs Jimmy Page would have given his whammy bar to have written, 
somehow record very good albums while they try. They mean it, man. 
</P>
<P>
So where Stephen Perkins may be the most powerful, rhythmically inventive 
drummer in rock 'n' roll, he was completely buried in the mix on Jane's' debut, 
"Nothing's Shocking." The lyrics tended toward the druggy 
stream-of-consciousness and the song structures tended toward anarchy. It was 
still one of the best albums of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"Ritual" is if anything more incoherent, scenes from the inner life of a 
mixed-up kid -- singer Perry Farrell. It rambles, it's murky, it features a 
long, vaguely Oriental violin solo. But "Ritual" is also oddly compelling, sort 
of an art-rock tour de force, and some of the sing-song melodies and images in 
the lyrics -- Farrell's brother making him slap himself in the face, a girl 
shoplifting a razor by sticking it under her skirt -- stick with you for far 
longer than you think they should. Plus, "Three Days" has the longest crescendo 
in rock history. JONATHAN GOLD

*** 1/2 LOS LOBOS "THE NEIGHBORHOOD" SLASH/WARNER BROS.: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A 
SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC). 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Lobos may be rooted in their neighborhood, as reflected in such uncommonly 
tender songs of community as "Be Still" and "The Giving Tree," but at times on 
this long-awaited effort these East L.A. musicians get a good running start and 
jump on board the rock 'n' roll mystery train too. 
</P>
<P>
There are the warm expressions of brotherhood, deeply felt spirituality and 
local concern smoothly crooned by David Hidalgo, and then, only slightly less 
expectedly, there is the album's darker and emphatically bluesy side, with 
songs of loss and loneliness mostly sung by the grittier-sounding Cesar Rosas, 
who keeps wishing that his baby would come back to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
It's an unusual, and unusually potent, combo, combining the soulful intensity 
and thematic heart of 1987's "By the Light of the Moon" album with the hardest 
rocking instincts yet shown on record by L.A.'s most rewarding home-grown band. 
Moments -- including "Little John of God" -- are so outrightly sentimental that 
they would be sheer Capra-corn in almost any other group's hands, but Los Lobos 
celebrates God and family without ever losing its edge. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Los Lobos avoids ever letting its well-known social empathy 
preclude the possibility of a good old rock 'n' roll self-pity party. Subtle 
Mexican touches both traditional and Valens-esque can be picked out -- and 
certainly no band from any other part of the country could have made this 
album. 
</P>
<P>
But part of the beauty and greatness of Los Lobos is that "The Neighborhood" 
could just as easily be in East Texas or East Memphis. There's a universality 
to the best Los Lobos song that speaks to the idealism and trials of every 
neighborhood. CHRIS WILLMAN

THAI FILM STAR WAITS TABLES IN NEW HOMELAND; 
</P>
<P>
THE 'DORIS DAY' OF THAI CINEMA MADE 29 MOVIES. SASITORN PHETROONG KULKA NOW 
WORKS IN A GLENDALE RESTAURANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
No one seems to notice the diminutive, easygoing waitress who moves through a 
Thai restaurant in Glendale in virtual anonymity on a Friday night. Waiting 
tables is usually an actress' first profession, but Sasitorn Phetroong Kulka 
has reversed the order. 
</P>
<P>
Before moving to the United States 12 years ago, Kulka made 29 films and at 
least 60 television programs in Thailand. She calls herself the "Doris Day" of 
Thai cinema. 
</P>
<P>
Despite more than a decade away from acting, the Los Angeles Thai press still 
routinely runs stories about her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for my newspaper to have her story in it. Everybody's interested in 
reading it. She's like Elizabeth Taylor: Whatever she does, everybody wants to 
know what she's doing," said Viraj Rojanapanya, editor of Thai LA Newspaper, 
which runs a photo feature on Kulka every year on her birthday, Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
TV Parade, a Thai entertainment magazine based in Los Angeles that covers Los 
Angeles and Bangkok, also runs the occasional story on Kulka "because a lot of 
people recognize her and want to know what's happened to her," said Managing 
Editor Cuthaleeya Chaturongkul, who compares Kulka to the late Jill Ireland 
because both actresses had relationships with famous leading men in their 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Both editors suggest that Kulka's popularity stems as much from this 
association as her acting work. She still receives fan letters from Thailand, 
and Thai newspapers periodically run stories about her. 
</P>
<P>
At 42, her large brown eyes, long sloping nose and creaseless face seem 
scarcely to have changed since her movie debut 24 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
She lives in a modest stucco house in Burbank, simply furnished and decorated 
with photo collages of herself and her American husband. In the living room, 
flanked by an Eastern altar with figures from Nepal and Laos and a Thai Buddha, 
and by a Western altar of TV, stereo, VCR, and CD player, Kulka pulls out a 
stack of scrapbooks and traces her path from growing rice in Thailand to 
serving it half a world away. 
</P>
<P>
She grew up as Sasitorn Phetroong, the eldest of five children in the village 
of Banna, about 60 miles east of Bangkok. Though her father worked as a 
bureaucrat, he also had a small rice farm, and Kulka remembers midday siestas 
spent lying on the backs of water buffaloes to ensure that they wouldn't eat 
the crop. 
</P>
<P>
Her chance to escape the village came in a local beauty contest. Sponsored by 
the sheriff, Kulka won the title of Miss Nakorn Nayok, representing a province. 
The mayor of Thonburi, a big city on the lookout for Miss Bangkok contestants, 
paid for Kulka to study at a beauty school for women in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tutelage of the beauty school operator -- herself an actress and a 
former Miss Universe runner-up -- Kulka entered and won 10 beauty contests, 
including Miss Bangkok. She captured every crown she vied for, except Miss 
Thailand, for which she was the 10th runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Kulka, who goes by the nickname Lake, which means small in Thai, shakes her 
hair, drawn up into a spout of black ringlets that cascade down her shoulders, 
before she segues from her role as beauty queen to star of the silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time they were looking for beauty contest girls that would look good 
in the camera," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the beauty school proprietor who taught Kulka acting and introduced her 
to a number of Thai film producers. She was on a movie set in 1966 when she met 
the other person she considers instrumental in teaching her to act. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the biggest star in Thailand," said Kulka of Mit Chaibuncha, whom she 
called the Clark Gable of Thai cinema. They soon began to play opposite each 
other, on screen and off. By 1968, Chaibuncha and Kulka were living together in 
Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
She was usually cast in the supporting role of "nice girls, because the people 
didn't accept me as others," Kulka said. 
</P>
<P>
Kulka would often work on as many as five films at once, a common practice for 
Thai actors. Chaibuncha, by contrast, made as many as 10 films at once "because 
everybody always wanted to see him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When they weren't working, Kulka and Chaibuncha would wait until after one of 
their movies started, then slip into a theater to study their performances and 
hear the audience's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
During the height of their popularity, Kulka and Chaibuncha seldom went 
unrecognized in public. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't seem to mind when people recognize her, and she doesn't have any 
privacy. She looks happy when people recognize her," said Rumpeuy Kerdpinyo, 
Kulka' sister, who now lives in Los Angel 
</P>
<P>
es. 
</P>
<P>
Then, one windy day in 1970, tragedy struck. Chaibuncha was performing a movie 
stunt that called for him to hang from a ladder beneath a helicopter as it flew 
over a beach. He lost his grip and fell several hundred feet to his death. 
</P>
<P>
Kulka was at a beauty shop at the time, having her hair dyed. The crew sent 
Chaibuncha's driver to tell her. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, Kulka can still recall those dark days. "I can't speak for 
days, only cry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"She went to the temple every night for 100 nights for three months. She always 
looked real upset, real sick, and she cried every day," said Kerdpinyo, who was 
sent to stay with her. 
</P>
<P>
"It was big, big news at the time," Kulka said. Chaibuncha's body had to be on 
display for 100 days instead of the usual seven or eight "so people could come 
and see him." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kulka continued to make movies for two more years, by all accounts, 
her heart wasn't in it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, she decided to come to the United States and study English. "I think 
she wanted to forget all those things," said Kerdpinyo. 
</P>
<P>
Kulka's husband, David, a free-lance electronics technician, agrees. "I think 
that's basically why she came to America. She just wanted a change of scene." 
</P>
<P>
She spent the next six years alternating stints of learning English in the Los 
Angeles area with making movies in Thailand. In 1978 she moved to Los Angeles 
permanently, but retained her Thai citizenship. By the early '80s she had met 
the man who would become her husband. Kulka was working as a waitress in a Thai 
restaurant where David Kulka used to get lunch. 
</P>
<P>
For two or three months, he asked her out, but she would never go. He stopped 
asking; the two remained friends, and he continued to go to the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until a trip to Thailand that David Kulka discovered her past 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to this woman on a street in Bangkok and I had a picture I'd 
taken of her in the restaurant," he said, referring to a photograph of Kulka. 
"I showed this woman the picture as someone I had a crush on, and she said, 
'This woman is a very famous movie star.' " 
</P>
<P>
"When I got back I asked her about it, and she admitted that, yes, she'd been 
an actress in Thailand . . . but she still wouldn't go out with me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Kulka changed her mind and asked David out. She says it was 
his persistence that eventually won her over. That was seven years ago, and 
"we've been together ever since, said David Kulka, who is six years younger 
than his wife. They were married in their back yard in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Kulkas managed to generate a fair amount of interest in the Thai press when 
they made their first trip to Thailand as husband and wife about a year after 
their marriage. The story and accompanying photos of the Thai wedding ceremony 
they held for her family received so much attention that people started to 
recognize David Kulka on the street. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Kulka busies herself with keeping house, gardening, and waitressing 
a few nights a week at TepThai. For Kulka, work is an opportunity to socialize. 
"I like to see the people and be with the people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although she lives almost in the back yard of Burbank's media district, the 
closest she has come to the American movie industry is watching them film NBC's 
"McMillan and Wife." On taking up acting in this country, Kulka says only, "My 
English isn't good enough." 
</P>
<P>
David Kulka has never seen any of his wife's films, despite repeated trips to 
Thailand since their marriage. They've been told that most of her movies are in 
bits and pieces now, the originals long gone. 
</P>
<P>
The Kulkas haven't been able to find her films in Thai video stores in Bangkok 
or Los Angeles. On a recent trip to Bangkok, Kulka approached one of the 
studios where she worked about trying to reconstruct one of her films from 
several different prints. She hopes to be able to get a videotape copy of one 
of her reconstructed films on her next trip to Thailand, possibly at the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Kulka still keeps in contact with a number of Thai movie producers. She said 
they've told her she's welcome to return to movie work whenever she wants, but 
she always declines. "My husband doesn't want me to because it would take too 
long," Kulka said. "I wouldn't absolutely stop her, but I wouldn't be very 
happy about it either," said David Kulka, who doesn't relish the thought of 
being separated from his wife for three or four months, the time it would take 
to complete one film. 
</P>
<P>
Although his work would allow him the option of staying with his wife while she 
made a movie, financial considerations have prevented him from doing that, 
David Kulka says. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Kulka has been out of the limelight for more than a decade, people 
still stop her on the street when she returns to Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people, when they see me, they ask, 'Why don't you come back?' " said 
Kulka, who confesses she misses acting "a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when I watch videos I want to be back and making movies, but I'm 
married now, and I think I better stay with my husband."

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Braxton's Aug. 19 article "The Graying of KABC" was most interesting, and 
we at KIEV add our congratulations to George Green and his crew. 
</P>
<P>
After 17 years with a very successful talk format at KIEV, we are sorry that 
the author did not stop by for a talk with us. We could have cleared up a 
serious misstatement when he wrote that we are "smaller, less powerful" when, 
in fact, our 10,000-watt power is twice the 5,000 watts at KABC.

<P>
Congratulations to letter writer Kathryn Wafer (Aug. 26) for keeping Calendar 
on the straight and narrow concerning Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck. 
</P>
<P>
I once busted Newsweek for its unforgivably calling Donald's nephews "Cub 
Scouts"; they are, of course, members in good standing of the Noble Order of 
Woodchucks. 
</P>
<P>
As someone who spent his first three years of grade school suffering in the 
slow-reader's circle, I happily remember the summer day when looking at the 
comic picture, I could suddenly read Donald Duck captions. 
</P>
<P>
Right-thinking editors everywhere should be aware of the inviolability and the 
loyalty many of us feel toward the Duckburg canon.

So Louie wears green, huh? As producer and writer of the animated feature "Duck 
Tales," I (along with my associates) went to great lengths never to 
differentiate between Huey, Dewey and Louie. 
</P>
<P>
What made them unique was that they were one personality in three bodies. 
</P>
<P>
However, I guess there are those like Kathryn Wafer who insists on structure 
and order for everything. If that's the case, don't I have the right to insist 
Louie's the one in red?

MOVIES AS ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most true artists create their works out of a need to express their visions and 
to enjoy their creations. And when an artist breaks through and if it is on a 
grand scale -- behold! -- there is the Art Facist, appearing from behind his 
coffee cup to deliver the sobering message that what the naive public is 
enjoying is in fact not good and, worse than that, is not "art." 
</P>
<P>
Thus a bitter and insulted public sludges away, reconvinced that art is 
something that is not enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
Want to be an Art Facist? Here's how! 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Love obscurity for obscurity's sake. If your favorite unknown creator 
suddenly becomes popular, inform everyone within earshot that the artist has 
sold out, his early stuff was his best and you liked him first. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Have contempt for the public. Remember: They don't read, they'll watch 
anything and they think that wrestling is real. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Have extra contempt for the Midwest. Keep telling yourself that between 
L.A. and New York there are only cows, tractors and guys with straw in their 
mouths. Oh, and they'd all kill their kids on videotape to win on "America's 
Funniest Home Videos." 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Above all, make sweeping generalizations. All movies are bad; all TV is 
bad (except PBS dramas in which the actors have British accents). 
</P>
<P>
If the exciting world of Art Facism sounds good to you, send your faith in 
mankind and a SASE to Larry Thomas Gardner. If he doesn't respond right away, 
don't worry. He's just out burning those trashy Kurosawa films.

STILL UNTOLD: THE REAL STORY OF AIR AMERICA IN INDOCHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a Vietnam War historian, I had been looking forward to the release of "Air 
America," said to be based on the CIA's airline in Southeast Asia and on the 
nonfiction book by Christopher Robbins, "Air America -- The Story of the CIA's 
Secret Airline." 
</P>
<P>
I know "it's just a movie" and not a documentary, but screenplay writers John 
Eskow and Richard Rush missed a golden opportunity to tell the true story of 
Air America, one of the most important of the Vietnam War: a recounting of men 
who flew, fought and, at times, died. 
</P>
<P>
* James (Earthquake) McGovern and Wallace Buford, flying supplies for Civil Air 
Transport (Air America's predecessor) to the encircled French garrison at Dien 
Bien Phu, were killed when their craft was hit by communist fire in 1954, 
becoming the only Americans to die in combat during the French Indochina War. 
</P>
<P>
* George Ritter, Roy Townley and Ed Weiddenback were reported missing in 1971 
after their C-123 was believed hit by anti-aircraft fire. 
</P>
<P>
* T.D. Latz piloted the Air America Huey helicopter that was photographed 
rescuing Americans and South Vietnamese from the rooftop of the U.S. embassy in 
Saigon on April 29, 1975, the last day of U.S. involvement in South Vietnam and 
the day before the South Vietnamese government surrendered; the photo became 
one of the war's most memorable images. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, most Americans know little of the real history of the Vietnam War 
or of the Air America crew members who, although killed or missing in action, 
are not honored with the inscription of their names on the Vietnam War National 
Monument in Washington because they were contract employees for the CIA.

MOVIES AS ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Thomas Gardner's Aug. 26 letter, describing his distaste for those of us 
who refer to film as an art form, reminded me of a conversation I once had with 
my father about my love life. He told me that because I was only 16, it was 
impossible for me to be in love. 
</P>
<P>
My father was wrong. It was immature, transient, flawed and fragile, but it was 
love. 
</P>
<P>
And so too is film an art form. Granted, it is an art form fraught with bad 
art, but in its relative youth it has also produced films of great intellect 
and beauty. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds as though Gardner has been scrutinizing the art form with his eyes 
tightly shut, and it saddens me that his clever denial of film precludes him 
from the enjoyment of film. This letter, then, is not a rebuttal but a sympathy 
card.

ART NOTEBOOK: L.A. FESTIVAL PROJECT DISPLAYS ARTWORK AND SPREADS SOCIAL 
COMMENTARY ON RTD BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Things were busy, as usual, in the downtown offices of the L.A. Festival last 
weekend. Slick posters were still being rolled for an upcoming event for 
festival donors, MacIntosh computers hummed through schedule updates, and 
miscellaneous office workers, surrounded by huge stacks of festival programs, 
chased telephones and shuffled papers. 
</P>
<P>
Entering unannounced into all this was artist Cheri Gaulke, carrying a small 
cargo of papers and poster board. The package was part of a festival project of 
her own invention called "Busz Words," a collection of 13 posters designed by 
local artists for display inside RTD buses. 
</P>
<P>
Often carrying blunt, colorful, messages of social commentary on issues from 
verbal child abuse to China's uncertain future, the signs are scheduled to be 
posted on more than 1,500 buses throughout the festival's run, ending Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The program may prove to be among the festival's most-seen events. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the buses as a way to communicate with a wider audience, a way of 
speaking to an audience you might not have access to in the museums," explained 
Gaulke, 36, the project's main coordinator and curator. "All the artists do 
gallery work. This was an opportunity to speak to people in a real kind of 
down-home, straightforward way. To me that was the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
In search of a room to discuss "Busz Words," Gaulke settled into an empty 
office and sat in a director's chair bearing the name Peter Sellars, the 
ubiquitous president and director of the festival. She said that before this 
new project, she had participated in doing a similar group of bus cards 
depicting women in history for the Women's Building, where Gaulke was an 
artist-in-residence for three years. Despite her feminist art background, 
Gaulke insisted that it was not intentional that all the posters have some 
socially conscious message. 
</P>
<P>
Her own poster depicts a Mother Earth-like face screaming angrily against a 
backdrop of newspaper articles describing atrocities against nature. Artist 
Mark Greenfield's "Key to Success" contrasts the two worlds faced by black and 
white children, linked together with a golden key. And Sheila Pinkel's 
"Consumer Research" reveals the crass mind-set of the last decade by 
contrasting Webster's 1962 definition of consumer with that of Webster's in 
1979. In the latter version, the earlier definition of the word as "a person or 
thing that destroys, uses up or wastes something" is eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased that the artists seemed to have the same interests as I did in 
speaking to people, and not being obscure or arty in their 
</P>
<P>
language," Gaulke said. "All the work had some level of controversy or dealt 
with issues that are hot or maybe make people uneasy." 
</P>
<P>
The posters are to be displayed on buses in sets of six and seven on routes 
throughout the city. Complete sets of the works are being shown at three local 
galleries: the William Grant Still Arts Center, the Highways Performance Space 
in Santa Monica, and the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The TDI Winston Network, the company contracted to rent advertising space from 
RTD, is underwriting the cost of placing the signs on the buses, said Claire 
Peeps, the festival's program director. She added that the "Busz Words" project 
also coincided nicely with the festival's campaign encouraging people to travel 
by bus to the various events. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the festival this time is very much about making things accessible and 
in nontraditional forums, it was a really attractive idea for us," said Peeps, 
pausing during her weekend work at the computer. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke said she hasn't ridden a bus herself since her earliest years in Los 
Angeles, after arriving from St. Louis in 1975. And coming from a 
performance-art background, including work with the Sisters of Survival 
performance group, she said that habit may make it difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel excited. But it's kind of abstract in a way, because I realize the bus 
posters are out there being seen by people, but in a way you don't get the 
feedback." 
</P>
<P>
"Busz Words," an exhibition of bus posters by 13 local artists; through Sept. 
16 at Highways Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica, (213) 453-1755; 
through Sept. 16 at the William Grant Still Arts Center, 2520 Westview St., 
(213) 734-1164; Sept. 8 to 29 at the Armory Center for the Arts, 145 N. Raymond 
Ave., Pasadena, (818) 792-5101; and on buses throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
HAVE A SEAT: An eclectic mix of local artists has taken chair design into new 
and startling directions for "Sweet Chair-ity," a benefit art show and auction 
at Art Options in Santa Monica. Proceeds will go to the Venice Family Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
But the group of 21 artists, including Steve Lapin, Abby Lazerow, Steven 
Granach, Frank Romero and Ken Steinkamp, hasn't exactly gone into full-time 
furniture design. Many of the show's chairs were not even designed to be used 
as seats. 
</P>
<P>
Lazerow &amp; Granach's "Gallina de Colores" is a lushly decorated baby 
highchair shaped like a four-legged chicken and smothered under an explosion of 
reds, blues, yellow, green and gold. And Steinkamp's "Wraptchaired" is a white 
metal folding chair -- adorned with the photograph of a woman sitting -- bound 
tightly in rope and netting. 
</P>
<P>
"The artists can stretch," said Marlene Riceberg, co-owner of Art Options in 
Santa Monica. "When you give them a project, they get very excited. It's a 
challenge, and it takes them out of what they do normally." 
</P>
<P>
This is the second year of "Sweet Chair-ity," which Riceberg and partner Fran 
Cey created to help the Venice Family Clinic where Riceberg's physician husband 
is a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
At last year's event, artists were asked to redesign, reconstruct or simply 
repaint existing chairs donated by a local manufacturer. This time, artists 
requested that they be allowed to create from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the artists are the same again this year," Riceberg said. "They wanted 
to do it again. And then it started getting out in the art community, where we 
now have artists calling us to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The chairs are displayed throughout Art Options, in a room designed by 
architect Brian Murphy. And until they are auctioned off Sept. 9 at the Santa 
Monica Museum of Art, they rest among the gallery store's other decorative and 
functional art. Nearby, palm trees sprout from square holes cut into the 
concrete floor. 
</P>
<P>
With Cey, wife of former Dodger Ron Cey, Riceberg launched Art Options to 
infect others with her appreciation of art. 
</P>
<P>
"It occurred to us that there was a need to introduce people to art in a way 
that would be friendly and not be intimidating," said Riceberg, who with her 
husband is listed as a charter donor at the Museum of Contemporary Art. "And 
maybe from that they would go on to become collectors." 
</P>
<P>
"Sweet Chair-ity," an exhibition and auction of unique chairs benefiting the 
Venice Family Clinic, through Sept. 9, Art Options, 2507 Main St., Santa 
Monica, (213) 392-9009.

PEACE ACTIVIST ODD MAN OUT AT ATOMIC REUNION; 
</P>
<P>
HIROSHIMA: FOR GEN. PAUL TIBBETS AND ENOLA GAY CREW, IT ENDED THE WAR. BUT 
RECONNAISANCE PILOT RICHARD SHERWOOD WITNESSED THE DEVASTATION AND DEDICATED 
LIFE TO PEACE. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Sherwood thought it ironic. 
</P>
<P>
The men who dropped the Hiroshima atom bomb -- the deadliest weapon ever 
unleashed in war -- were gathering at their old training base to dedicate a 
monument to peace. 
</P>
<P>
This, Sherwood had to see. For whatever the atom bomb did to end World War II, 
it secured no peace for him. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1945, Sherwood was a 21-year-old bomber pilot stationed in the 
western Pacific. He didn't help drop the world's first nuclear weapon on 
Hiroshima, Japan, but he believes his mission was even more troubling -- 
witnessing the charred ruins during a low-level photographic flight after the 
blast. 
</P>
<P>
The devastation he saw changed his life, and he vowed to work toward nonviolent 
ways of settling conflicts, a vow he keeps today as a peace activist in Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
He had hoped his work for peace would help him forget the horrors of war. It 
did not. So last weekend, after 45 years, Richard Sherwood decided to confront 
his past head-on. 
</P>
<P>
"A Celebration for World Peace," said the banner strung over the road. 
"Wendover Welcomes the 509th Composite Group." 
</P>
<P>
Wendover, a little desert town on the Utah-Nevada border 120 miles west of Salt 
Lake City, served as the World War II base for the 509th, a top-secret wing of 
the Army Air Corps formed specifically to drop the untested atom bomb. 
</P>
<P>
There had been reunions before, but last weekend's gathering was the largest, 
drawing nearly 500 members and wives. 
</P>
<P>
There were three big attractions. A monument to the 509th would be unveiled. 
They'd be able to visit their old air base, now abandoned. And best of all, 
they'd get to see retired Brig. Gen. Paul W. Tibbets, former commander of the 
509th and still its spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
Tibbets piloted the Enola Gay, the B-29 bomber that dropped the bomb on 
Hiroshima. He didn't make the decision -- that was President Harry S. Truman's 
burden -- but today he is the bombing's most outspoken defender, saying it 
brought a quick end to World War II and saved more lives than it cost. He has 
no regrets, no remorse, and no patience for those who question the rightness of 
using the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the reunion, Sherwood had little patience for the general. 
</P>
<P>
"Tibbets!" he said angrily. "Tibbets would have a different feeling if he had 
been 150 feet over that destruction and saw what I saw." 
</P>
<P>
When the atom bomb exploded above Hiroshima, it created a fireball that leveled 
62,000 buildings and killed 80,000 people. Directly beneath the blast, people 
were vaporized. Up to two miles away, the heat charred skin. Stone walls glowed 
red, and rivers clogged with floating bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood recalls "an utter chaos of squirming human destruction" and still 
breaks into tears at the memory. "I felt so cannibalistic, I could scarcely 
accept what I saw." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Sherwood returned home to Salt Lake City and tried to forget. He 
married, finished college, and got a job with the city's water department. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, he said, he kept busy. 
</P>
<P>
But the memories stuck. In 1981, at the urging of his Methodist minister, he 
became more active in peace issues, hoping to find what he calls "sanction" for 
his World War II involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood has protested the MX missile and participated in peace walks in the 
Soviet Union. More recently, he organized a vacation-exchange program between 
Americans and Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
At 66, his sharp pilot's eyes have dimmed somewhat but still are as blue as the 
desert sky. His thick brown hair has thinned and whitened. 
</P>
<P>
He looked like most of the men at the reunion, where aging soldiers peered 
through bifocals at name tags to jog their fading memories of old wartime 
buddies. Few recognized Sherwood, which did not surprise him. He says he was 
attached to another wing, flying with the 509th only briefly as a replacement 
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Some expressed doubt at his tale. Tibbets, who has written a book about the 
mission, could not remember Sherwood's reconnaissance flight, but neither could 
he remember that it did not occur. "After 45 years, who can say? Go with his 
story," Tibbets said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the men Sherwood approached just wished he would go somewhere else with 
his tale. He wanted to recall the horrors of war. They wanted to reminisce 
about beer parties and wild Army nurses. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, I don't want to argue the point with you," said Fred Kopka, who worked 
in the 509th mess hall. "It was us or them, kill or be killed. The Japanese 
were going to fight tooth and nail if we had to invade Japan. The bomb saved a 
million lives." 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood moved on. He wanted to talk to Tibbets. But Tibbets was busy, signing 
autographs for admirers who had lined up to buy his line of commemorative Enola 
Gay books, posters, coffee mugs and videos. Sherwood decided to try again 
later. 
</P>
<P>
At a "men's remembrance," Sherwood persuaded the organizers to give him a few 
minutes at the microphone. He told of his Soviet-American exchange program. The 
audience listened politely, but the brochures he left by the door went 
virtually untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, by nightfall, Sherwood was elated. In the empty parking lot of the 
Wendover visitors' center, he sat by the 509th monument, which still was 
shrouded in black plastic. 
</P>
<P>
He said the reunion made him feel less lonely in his anguish. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind they're hurting too," he said. Why else, he asked, 
would they be so defensive about their role in dropping the atomic bomb? Why 
else would they feel (the need) to erect a monument praising themselves? 
</P>
<P>
"I see me and them, and I know where they're coming from," Sherwood said. "I 
had feelings of disgust for Tibbets. I no longer do. What's happening here 
today gives them a feeling of acceptance for what they did. They're getting 
sanction. I understand how they're feeling." 
</P>
<P>
But understanding is not enough, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to change. There's no way out of atomic holocaust unless we find an 
alternative to building bigger and better bombs. There are some real 
differences we can make. All we have to do is start to realize that everybody 
has a responsibility to live internationally. The world is too small now to 
isolate ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Lightning filled the air and thunder rumbled ominously close. But Sherwood paid 
no mind. He spoke excitedly of connecting with other cultures, of teaching 
young people not the glory of war but the joy of peace, of redirecting mental 
energy now devoted toward destructive technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk about atomic explosions. Lord, we could have an explosion of ideas that 
would boggle your mind." 
</P>
<P>
By morning, the storm had passed, and the parking lot filled with people for 
the dedication ceremony. The black plastic covering the monument was gone, 
replaced by red, white and blue bunting. The speakers' platform groaned under 
the weight of dignitaries, and the 23rd Army band played rousing military 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tibbets rose to speak, and the crowd gave him a standing ovation. At 75, 
he is hard of hearing and walks stiffly, but he held their respect as if he 
still was their commanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
Be not ashamed for bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he told those gathered. 
Nuclear weaponry has "caused peace to reign . . . for 45 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was fighting a war against an entrenched enemy, he said. If 
Allied forces had been forced to invade Japan, perhaps a million lives would 
have been lost, he said, compared to the estimated 180,000 who died in 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
Americans today often don't appreciate the sacrifices that ensured our present 
good fortune, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to exercise their brains by reading about what happened in 
those days. Well, that leaves some of us to tell them what happened. Hopefully, 
they will remember it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Tibbets unveiled the memorial, a 16-foot granite obelisk supporting a 
bronze replica of the Enola Gay. Below was a plaque with the logo of the 509th 
Composite Group, a lightning bolt and the phrase "First Atomic Bombardment." 
</P>
<P>
For a peace monument, it was strikingly martial. But then, so was the ceremony. 
Little mention was made of the victims. A Japanese author had been scheduled to 
speak, but he was quickly unscheduled the previous night -- along with the 
Japanese national anthem -- after suggesting that Japan might have surrendered 
without the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. William B. Downey, 509th chaplain, closed the ceremony with a 
dedicatory prayer: 
</P>
<P>
"We thank thee, God, for the atom bomb, through which peace came to our world." 
</P>
<P>
A squadron of jet fighters thundered overhead and the band struck up another 
tune. Tibbets and other crew members of the Enola Gay were corralled for 
pictures in front of the obelisk. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Richard Sherwood was there too, smiling and shaking Tibbets' hand. 
Sherwood shouted a few words, but Tibbets could not hear above the crowd. He 
gave Sherwood a puzzled look, then turned again toward the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, the hawk and the dove stood together. Despite their differences, 
they have a common bond in their conviction that the world must never forget 
the lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
But just what is that lesson? 
</P>
<P>
Peace comes through strength, says Tibbets. 
</P>
<P>
Peace comes through understanding, says Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear which message won this day. Tibbets was the hero. Sherwood was in 
the way. A camera-toting woman shouted, "The crew, just the crew," and Sherwood 
retreated into the crowd, an observer once again.

Rinchinsanbuu and his family stood proudly beside their white herder's tent, 
sheep grazing nearby. He could envision no better life. 
</P>
<P>
"I take care of 100 cows and 300 sheep," said Rinchinsanbuu, 51. "I have 15 
children. I have spent my life in the countryside. I want to stay as a 
herdsman." 
</P>
<P>
Herdsmen, and with them Mongolia's cultural legacies, face an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
Mongolia once was a nation of nomadic herders, but fewer than 40% of its 2 
million people now herd their horses, sheep, cattle and camels across the vast 
Central Asian steppe. 
</P>
<P>
Those who remain herders, like Rinchinsanbuu, are constricted by the borders of 
state farms and agricultural cooperatives, which have owned most of Mongolia's 
livestock since the communists took over in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
New democratic parties that recently won a voice in government want to give the 
animals back to the herdsmen and allow freer grazing. That, plus the concern of 
the new parties for reviving traditional culture, would reinforce the old ways. 
</P>
<P>
Both the new groups and the Communist Party, however, also want to increase 
Mongolia's links to the outside world, attract foreign investors and tourists, 
and introduce modern technology. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to restricting the herdsmen, communism also cushioned them from 
modernity by stunting overall economic growth. It is impossible to predict how 
the herding lifestyle will survive a return to capitalism and the expected 
invasion of Japanese tourists and Hong Kong television. 
</P>
<P>
The culture of Mongolian cities already is largely imported. 
</P>
<P>
Most young people wear Western clothes, and horses have given way to 
motorbikes, cars and buses. Television, ballet, video parlors and rock concerts 
provide entertainment for urban office workers. 
</P>
<P>
For Rinchinsanbuu and his family, life still follows a traditional outline. 
</P>
<P>
"I get up at 5 a.m. and sleep at midnight," he said. "I could even say I work 
25 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
He looks after 100 cattle and 300 sheep for the Tuya Agricultural Cooperative 
and has 50 sheep, cattle and horses of his own. 
</P>
<P>
At least three times a year, he and his family dismantle their three round 
tents, called gers, pile their possessions on a horse-drawn cart and move to 
new pastures. 
</P>
<P>
They cook their meals on wood-burning stoves whose pipes project from the tops 
of the gers, sending thin streams of smoke into the wide blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
Every now and then, they slaughter a sheep for food, but most of the time they 
eat boiled mare's milk or strong-tasting cheese, and bread with fresh butter or 
dried curds. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment generally means listening to the radio, but there are several 
festivals each year that feature Mongolian wrestling, horse racing, archery and 
singing. 
</P>
<P>
Herders preserve traditional courtesies. When unexpected visitors stopped at 
his summer camp on a hillside 35 miles east of Ulan Bator, the capital, 
Rinchinsanbuu donned his best del, an outer garment closed with a wide, 
colorful sash at the waist. 
</P>
<P>
While his wife served milk tea, he solemnly handed a snuff bottle around. 
</P>
<P>
Rinchinsanbuu and his good friend Dashnyam laughed when asked if it would not 
be easier to live in a city and work in a factory. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course city life is quite good, because these city residents can have 
anything they want in a department store," Dashnyam said. "But I think we are 
rich. We have more fresh air, more meat. Country life is healthy." 
</P>
<P>
By another measure, the herders are poor. According to the government, the 
average herder working for a cooperative earns about 3,340 tugriks a year, less 
than $600 even at the artificially high official exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation is abysmal. Flies are abundant and outhouses are crude. 
</P>
<P>
Rinchinsanbuu is relatively wealthy. He and his grown sons own a generator, 
which are few and expensive, and three televisions, which are rare outside 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Ichinkhorloo, a yak herder camped across the stream, said he wanted electricity 
because "it is very difficult to live without light, and there is a shortage of 
candles." Ichinkhorloo said he also wanted more pay, "maybe 300 to 400 tugriks 
a month." 
</P>
<P>
Ochir, an 80-year-old camped several miles away, said he wanted a bigger 
pension. He gets 60 tugriks a month, about $10, and must continue raising sheep 
because it is too little to live on. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the older herders, Ochir hesitated to blame the Communist Party 
for the poor economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I have supported this party from my childhood," he said. "I don't know about 
these new parties. We don't know who they are." 
</P>
<P>
In places where the new parties campaigned extensively, the July 29 election 
showed herders can be open to change. 
</P>
<P>
A good example was the Gachuurt State Farm just outside Ulan Bator, where a 
Communist ran for the national legislature unopposed. Voters rejected him and a 
new election is being scheduled.

<P>
Joyce Cutshall is consumed by a battle she can never win. She thinks her 
daughter is dead, but can't prove it. She suspects she is buried nearby, but 
can't find her. 
</P>
<P>
She wants to bring her home, but can't do it. 
</P>
<P>
She has made that her mission, taking the law into her own hands to find out 
what happened to her child. Fearful that Jill's case would sink deeper in 
police files, the determined mother who had never touched a legal book started 
a petition drive, forced a grand jury probe, and prompted an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after Jill's disappearance, Joyce Cutshall believes she is closer 
than ever to the truth -- a truth that will bring even greater agony. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that this last chapter is going to be my absolutely most difficult," 
she says. "It's a very, very strange feeling to work so hard toward something 
to know that at the end of it, it's going to bring as much grief and pain as a 
mother can feel." 
</P>
<P>
This fall, when David Phelps, 26, goes on trial on charges of kidnaping Jill, 
Cutshall will be there, hoping his words will lead to her daughter's body, 
knowing that even if she wins, she loses. The prospect is frightening, yet 
comforting. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I can put Jill to rest in my own mind and have a place that I can go and 
visit her whenever I'm having a difficult day or feel the need to see her," she 
says, "that will help me deal with the fact that I won't have a chance to hold 
her again." 
</P>
<P>
For now, she lives with memories -- how Jill loved butter. And mementos: 
pictures of horses and hearts, a note to "the greatest mom in the world," 
crayon drawings of the sun, flowers and rainbows -- her symbol for the future 
-- and poems. 
</P>
<P>
"The world is a great round ball thing that is made by God," Jill wrote. "It 
has good things on it and bad things on it. The world is great to me." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 13, 1987, 9-year-old Jillian Dee Cutshall vanished from that world she 
so cherished. 
</P>
<P>
She disappeared in Norfolk, where she was spending the summer with her father, 
Roger. The Cutshalls divorced in 1985; Jill and her brother, Jeff, lived in 
Kansas with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
Jill, her mother says, feared staying in her father's apartment house alone; it 
was seedy, noisy, filled with transients. So when he and his new wife left for 
work at 6 a.m., she did her chores, then walked to the baby sitter's six blocks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
That day, she was last seen at 6:30 a.m. on her sitter's stoop, where she 
normally waited until someone inside awoke. 
</P>
<P>
Jill had been repeatedly warned about strangers. But the blonde, blue-eyed 
youngster "just loved people," her mother says. "She trusted them. She always 
found something good in everybody, even if they weren't good." 
</P>
<P>
After Jill's disappearance, the FBI, state and local police blitzed the area. 
There were roadblocks, door-to-door searches, hundreds of interviews. Tens of 
thousands of posters flooded the country. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Joyce Cutshall thought Jill would return in a week, then months. 
"After the third month," she says, "I emotionally and mentally was telling 
myself that if we work hard enough, we'll have her back in a year." 
</P>
<P>
A year passed. No Jill. 
</P>
<P>
Hope turned to heartache. 
</P>
<P>
Then in the fall of 1988, when Cutshall, 36, was attending a local college, a 
journalism student, Gail Pedersen, interviewed her for a story. Pedersen 
revealed that police had questioned her brother, David Phelps, about Jill. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps' sister, she says, told her: "'I'm not saying that he is guilty or 
innocent' . . . (but) she felt that it was a possibility that he in some way 
was connected to her disappearance." 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen also claimed her brother sexually abused a little girl when he was a 
teen. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps and a man once imprisoned for sexual assault, Kermit Baumgartner, lived 
together in the same building as Roger Cutshall the summer of 1987. Both 
reportedly met Jill then. Police had interviewed both men. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Stephens, a private investigator on the case since the beginning, pursued 
the lead too, knowing his own secret -- a 1976 prison stint for burglary -- 
could be revealed and he could be blackmailed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've put everything on the line for Jill," says Stephens, who last year made 
public his past, returning the detective's license he falsely obtained. 
</P>
<P>
The burly, bearded investigator believed his own history gave him an edge -- "I 
know both sides of the law," he says. In January, 1989, Stephens drove Phelps 
to the wildlife refuge where a hunter discovered Jill's clothes in late 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He handed him a shovel. He asked him to help find Jill. 
</P>
<P>
"All he keeps saying is: 'I don't know anything,' " Stephens recalls. "I keep 
saying: 'You do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Stephens, accompanied by a partner, says he then fired a gun in the air. 
Frustration, he says, not a threat. He claims Phelps led them to a nearby 
cemetery, dug in one spot, then told him he and Baumgartner had taken Jill to 
the refuge and even described her clothes and underwear. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens had Phelps repeat his statement to an Omaha TV crew he had waiting 
nearby. The investigator says he didn't go to the police, fearing that they 
would reject the information. 
</P>
<P>
In that interview, later broadcast on "60 Minutes," Phelps described how Kermit 
got a nervous Jill out of the car. "Kermit kept his hand on her mouth and 
started fondling her and stuff," he said. "I got real nervous and said, 'Hey, 
let's get the hell out of here.' And Kermit says, 'Well, then, you take the car 
back into town and I'll get back later.' And I left." 
</P>
<P>
Baumgartner, who lives in California, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. He 
claims Phelps was trying to cover his tracks. 
</P>
<P>
When police questioned Phelps, he recanted, claiming his statements were made 
under duress. No body, no confession, no charges. 
</P>
<P>
David Phelps was a free man. He soon left town. 
</P>
<P>
So did Baumgartner, who had also been questioned by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I was empty," Joyce Cutshall recalls in hushed tones. "Whatever there is 
inside of me that says . . . 'I need to fight. I need to go on' -- that was 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
She'd lost her faith, too, in the police. "There were major screw-ups," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Norfolk Police Chief Bill Mizner disagrees, noting that thousands of hours were 
spent interviewing hundreds of people and pursuing leads in several states. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some outstanding police work done in this investigation," he says. 
"It is by far the longest, most in-depth case that the police division here has 
ever faced (and) by far the most frustrating case." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, when Mizner placed Jill's case on semi-active status, Cutshall was 
outraged. 
</P>
<P>
"If you cannot rely on people that you're supposed to be able to rely on to do 
the job, I guess the old adage is . . . 'Do it yourself.' " 
</P>
<P>
She began. 
</P>
<P>
Cutshall discovered that under Nebraska law, authorities had to convene a grand 
jury if presented with petitions from at least 10% of county voters 
participating in the last gubernatorial election. 
</P>
<P>
In December, while others shopped for Christmas gifts, she collected 
signatures. While the local mall was being decorated, she was setting up a 
table and banner reading: "Jill Cutshall Needs A Grand Jury." 
</P>
<P>
A dozen volunteers gathered signatures at the mall and braved blizzards to 
collect more in door-to-door visits. Petitions were presented to authorities on 
Feb. 20 -- the day after Jill's birthday -- "my gift to her," her mother says. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities, she says, certified 1,471 signatures, hundreds more than needed. 
</P>
<P>
Cutshall downplays her doggedness, saying: "I don't have anything extra. The 
only thing I have is the love for my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
In June, a grand jury indicted Phelps on charges of abduction with intent to 
commit sexual assault. Last month, he returned to Nebraska from Iowa and 
pleaded not guilty. He's being held on $100,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
Baumgartner wasn't charged. Special prosecutor James Smith said one problem was 
getting him back to Nebraska to testify before a grand jury. He had already 
made consistent statements to authorities. "It's not as if they didn't know 
what the guy's story was anyhow," Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens, who keeps a picture of Jill on his desk, says he won't rest until he 
finds her. He heads investigations for the Missing Youth Foundation, a 
nonprofit group founded after Jill's disappearance that boasts of having 
brought home 17 children since January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Cutshall, meanwhile, hopes the Nov. 5 trial will help her and Jeff, 14, start 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff, who saw himself as Jill's protector, has endured his own hell with 
schoolmates' taunts of "We know where your sister is." He even talked of 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
For a year after Jill's disappearance, Joyce Cutshall wrote her letters. Part 
of the first one seems prophetic. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a part of me that is gone. I hope you are doing OK, sweet pea," she 
wrote. "I know you feel inside how special you are to me. I could never ask for 
a better daughter than the one I'm blessed with. If I can't find you soon, I'm 
afraid I'll never see you again." 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Joyce Cutshall's heart still needs to convince her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I absolutely have to be able to have her in a place where I can make that 
contact with her," she says. "Until I can do this, there's a chance she's still 
alive. . . . She's out there lost waiting to be found. I can't quit doing this 
until I can find her and bring her back."

The woman crouched alongside the road, slowly swaying back and forth, holding 
her baby loosely in her shawl. 
</P>
<P>
The curfew was in force but she did not care. She had given up. 
</P>
<P>
Her bare feet splashed in the rainwater puddle, stirring the sand. She was 
young. She was lost. The war had killed her spirit but she could not die. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't, I can't. There's nothing. I don't want your money. Nothing to buy. 
Nothing to buy. I don't want your money," she said as she stamped her feet in 
the puddle. 
</P>
<P>
The baby screwed up its red face. The woman was too tired to cry or even 
listen. She put the money given her on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Hunger has almost emptied the streets. The only people left are too hungry to 
get off the road when the curfew starts. They don't care what the soldiers 
might tell them or do to them, or that they might steal from them. 
</P>
<P>
They don't know when the curfew starts. The sun goes down and it's just another 
night on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Liberia's civil war has become bloodier and more brutal each month since former 
civil servant Charles Taylor launched his drive to oust President Samuel K. Doe 
in February. Rival rebel leader Prince Johnson split from Taylor's group and 
the two rebel armies encircled the capital. 
</P>
<P>
But what began as a quick advance on Doe's executive mansion bogged down and 
today the rebels spend as much time fighting each other as they do attacking 
Doe. Deep tribal divisions have resulted in several massacres of refugees and 
innocent civilians. 
</P>
<P>
People have crossed the river to where Prince Johnson's rebels have opened some 
of the warehouses and handed out rice. Up to 3,000 people wait in queues. They 
wait in the rain along the road. They wait and they beg and they faint from 
hunger. But they still wait. 
</P>
<P>
Freddie from the Lebanese Embassy arrives at a foreigner's house with ham, tins 
of milk, prunes, crackers and bottles of Amaretto and Cinzano. His prices are 
high but he doesn't reveal them until after the purchaser makes his selections. 
Then he mutters about the sliding exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
The food Freddie sells is stolen. Some of it came from the Ashi supermarket. 
The owner of the Ashi was arrested by the rebels. He had been providing food 
for President Doe. Even the president is running short of food. The rebels 
arrested the supermarket owner and burned his supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
The hungry people saw it burning. They knew what was inside. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Johnson shot a man he said was profiteering from the war. The man, a 
Liberian called Bashi, was selling rice to refugees across the river from the 
city center. Johnson, though he had agreed to the sale as a way of preventing a 
stampede for rice, shot the man while he was handcuffed to a French aid worker 
who had been doing the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
The rice belonged to the Firestone Rubber Co. The U.S. government had agreed to 
buy the rice from Firestone and then have it distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is proud that he shot a profiteer. Now he is planning on selling the 
rice himself. He thinks it's a good idea, a good way of stopping a stampede of 
hungry people. Some Lebanese people are going to arrange it for him. And, of 
course, they will take a cut of the money. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think it's a good idea?" he asks, sitting back in his chair at the 
roadside cafe that is his field headquarters. Everybody nods. He swigs at a 
near-empty bottle of rum. It's 10 a.m. He grins and puts his hand over his 
mouth in a slightly childish gesture, like a naughty boy somebody has given a 
war to play with. 
</P>
<P>
His troops all clap in sincere approval. 
</P>
<P>
A group of women come around the corner of the cafe. They plead and beg for 
rice. One of them becomes hysterical. Her high-pitch voice grates and 
infuriates Johnson. He hits her. Pushes her and the others away. They run, 
moaning, afraid he might shoot at them. 
</P>
<P>
He empties his bottle of rum. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the stores are empty of food, the government soldiers have taken to 
stealing the floor tiles, the shelves and the light fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody really understands why. There is nobody to buy the goods. And everybody 
knows the soldiers probably will die when the rebels attack the palace and they 
realize at last that they have nowhere left to go. 
</P>
<P>
Even the president will have nowhere to go. The U.S. Marine helicopter will not 
be able to take him out now. It would be too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the troops loot the shops of what is left, while a few blocks away the 
rebels shoot at them. But they would rather steal and die than defend 
themselves. Steal until there is nothing left to steal and then die with a 
roomful of light fixtures, floor tiles and empty shelves.

Police have taken to escorting garbage trucks in the Naples area because of 
what they say appears to be a Mafia-style campaign to intimidate private 
collectors into paying protection money. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the anti-terrorist police squad in Naples said Friday that they 
were investigating a string of attacks to see if they are linked to the 
Camorra, a crime syndicate based in the Naples area that is compared to the 
Sicilian Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, two hooded youths on a motorcycle stopped a garbage truck at 
gunpoint in Portici, a township on the outskirts of Naples. 
</P>
<P>
The youths forced the driver and his partner to leave the truck and shot eight 
times at it, damaging the windshield and hood. They youths sped away.

Young love blossomed two years ago at a hospital detox center. Sara and Rafael 
were both 20, both shooting heroin and cocaine, both looking for a way out. 
They found each other. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started, he was determined to stop drugs," said Sara, who didn't want 
her real name used. "I would go get high, and I would curse him out. He would 
say: 'Come on. We can change together.' " 
</P>
<P>
The detox program didn't change them. But 18 months ago, they joined the 
Addiction Research &amp; Treatment Corp.'s Heterosexual and HIV transmission 
study. The five-year study involves counseling and periodic follow-ups. 
Participants are tested for exposure to the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Sara tested positive. Rafael did not. And that changed everything. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt cheated," she said, thinking of the moment when she read the results. 
"Here I am getting my life together, and this is happening to me?" 
</P>
<P>
"She went crazy," said Rafael, who also did not want his real name used. "She 
said she was going to get high again that day. She said she was going to do 
drugs. I was watching her, because I was nervous she was going to do something 
crazy, something stupid." 
</P>
<P>
She cried, and he held her. "I love you," he told her. "It doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
But Sara's anger and confusion were overwhelming. For a month, she washed her 
dishes in bleach for fear her nieces or nephews would somehow catch the virus 
from her. She wouldn't let anyone touch her. She couldn't believe Rafael wanted 
to stay with her. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell him that if I had found out he had it, I would have left him," Sara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"And I tell her: 'Not everybody's the same. You got your feelings, I've got 
mine,' " Rafael said. "I know she got hurt, knowing that she got it. I'm going 
to treat her bad too? I didn't treat her bad, and she wanted to go kill herself 
anyway. Imagine if I had said: 'I'm leaving you now.' Maybe she would have done 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Sara knows when she was exposed. She shared a needle with her older sister, who 
had said she carried the AIDS virus. Sara didn't believe her. Now it is Rafael 
who has a hard time believing. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't face it. He doesn't face it at all. To him, this is like a flu 
that's going to get better," Sara said. "He says: 'I know you're not going to 
die.' He doesn't face it at all. And we talk about this every day, that he has 
to accept it, that I'm going to get sick. And that he has to go on with his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"He says: 'It's not true. Don't worry about it. You're going to keep living.' I 
say: 'Please listen to me. This is happening to us.' He doesn't want to hear 
it." 
</P>
<P>
About 20% of the 12,236 women with AIDS in the United States are Latino, like 
Sara, even though Latinos make up just 7% of the population. More than half of 
those women contracted AIDS through needle-sharing, like Sara and her sister. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had both had it, it would have been OK. But he didn't have it, and I 
felt like I was depriving him of his life. I told him that day: 'Do your life. 
You can find somebody else,' " said Sara, who grew up in the Bronx and now 
lives with Rafael in her mother's house. 
</P>
<P>
This brown-eyed man with the soft voice and gentle ways is the best thing in 
her life. The worst thing is the possibility that she might infect him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get him sick. That's my biggest fear. It would be worse for me 
to know I got him sick than to know I'm sick myself." 
</P>
<P>
The risk of contracting AIDS is at least 15 times greater among black and 
Latino heterosexuals than among Anglo heterosexuals. Heterosexual contact 
between intravenous drug users and their partners is spreading the virus faster 
than any other transmission mode, with the number of those cases up 27% from 
1988 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sara and Rafael know the risks. Rafael told their counselor, Regina Phillips, 
that he was afraid he would hurt Sara's feelings if he insisted on using 
condoms. Now it is Sara who insists, often without success. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't want to protect himself. I bought all kinds of them, $7 for one of 
them. He won't use them," she said. "It wouldn't hurt me, if he uses them. It 
would hurt me more if he got sick. That would kill me."

MORMONS RESTORING CITY OF ANCESTORS; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: NAUVOO, ILL., ON MISSISSIPPI RIVER WAS CENTER OF THE CHURCH'S WORLD 
FOR 7 YEARS DURING THE 1800S.

NAUVOO, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Craftsmen are putting the finishing touches on a dream that spans generations: 
a restored Mormon mecca on the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Completion of a log cabin and post office, due this month, will cap the 
extraordinary rebirth of the city -- known in its heyday as Nauvoo the 
Beautiful -- that was the center of the Mormon world for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The Mormons have spent 28 years and more than $15 million restoring more than 
two dozen houses and shops, and have added two visitors' centers and a 700-acre 
farm complete with 330 head of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
"People come here because it's a historical setting," said Elder Loren C. Dunn, 
president of Nauvoo Restoration Inc. "By telling the story of Nauvoo, we are 
also telling the story of the church. The people are coming in through the 
historical door." 
</P>
<P>
From 1839 until 1846, a swamp below a bend in the river, some 80 miles upstream 
from Hannibal, Mo., was transformed into a bustling city of 12,000. Mormons 
fleeing angry mobs in Missouri and converts arriving from Great Britain were 
among those who settled in Nauvoo. 
</P>
<P>
Second only to Chicago as the most populous Illinois city, Nauvoo was where 
church founder Joseph Smith's vision of a theocracy achieved its fullest 
flowering. Then, just as in Missouri, political, economic and religious 
differences with non-Mormon neighbors degenerated into armed conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was slain by a mob in nearby Carthage in 1844, and within two years of 
his death, the "City of Joseph" was a virtual shell. The Mormons, led by 
Brigham Young, made their westward exodus. 
</P>
<P>
The Mormons never forgot Nauvoo, however. Decades after their sorrowful 
departure, pilgrims returned to reclaim a sense of their past. One who made the 
trip after 78 years put his thoughts to verse: 
</P>
<P>
 In '46 I left Nauvoo 
</P>
<P>
 Behind an old oxen team. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I'm going back in a Henry Ford, 
</P>
<P>
 To see how it will seem. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Leroy Kimball, a Salt Lake City physician whose patients included several 
top officials of the Mormon Church, believed that Nauvoo could be revived. 
Kimball's powers of persuasion were a match for his healing skills. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're there in a doctor's office with your clothes off, you're kind of 
forced to listen," his son, James L. Kimball, recalled. "Dad really pushed the 
idea that something should be done." 
</P>
<P>
Several of those captive listeners journeyed to Nauvoo in 1960 to see the home 
of Heber C. Kimball, a Joseph Smith associate who was Kimball's 
great-grandfather. The doctor had bought the house in 1954 and restored it. 
Kimball and others who had bought property at Nauvoo were prepared to donate 
them to the church. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful that any large-scale Mormon effort would drive up land values and 
inflame anti-Mormon sentiments, church leaders in 1962 established the 
nonprofit corporation to do the restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The church's 1,250 acres of old Nauvoo include 23 restored houses and shops. 
The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which split with 
the Mormons after the Nauvoo period, has restored another 44-acre section that 
includes Joseph Smith's residence and grave site. 
</P>
<P>
The pastoral serenity by the big river and down a verdant hill from the modern 
town of 1,100 people verges on the mythic. One expert on the city's history 
calls it "a dreamscape, almost," a Nauvoo of the imagination. Local residents 
say it is "the Colonial Williamsburg of the Midwest." 
</P>
<P>
That's just the problem, historians grouse. 
</P>
<P>
Although the project was carefully researched by archeologists, architects and 
historians, it has drawn criticism from scholars who say the manicured grounds 
and neat brick structures bear little resemblance to the original city. 
</P>
<P>
"People who go to Nauvoo and think they have seen the real Nauvoo are sadly 
mistaken," said Robert Bruce Flanders, a Southwest Missouri State historian. 
"It's true of Nauvoo, as of Williamsburg. It really doesn't look anything like 
Nauvoo did in 1845." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Flanders gave the church high marks for its restoration of individual 
buildings such as the Brigham Young home. He said he knew of no other site 
where "there is so little development overlaying an old settlement." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn has heard the criticisms, and tries to put them in perspective. "There are 
not any two historians that will agree what Nauvoo was really like," he said, 
"and we've tried to restore it, to the best of our ability."

Legislation to provide federal funding for police foot patrols in areas of Los 
Angeles and San Diego with high levels of drug-related crime has been sent to 
Gov. George Deukmejian's desk by the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
A 54-21 vote was cast on the measure (AB 4087) by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman

the Senate by a 28-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
A similar 1989 program decreased violent crimes in targeted Los Angeles regions 
by 11% and a 1987 program in San Diego cut violent crimes by 30%, Friedman 
said. 
</P>

PAIR CHARGED IN DEATH OF N.Y. PROSECUTOR

Two people were charged Friday with shooting to death an assistant prosecutor 
who happened into the line of fire in a drug turf battle one block from the 
courthouse where he worked, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Diaz, 21, and Ernesto Garcia, 16, were each charged with second-degree 
murder, second-degree attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Sean Healy, 30, an assistant district attorney in the Bronx, was 
buying doughnuts at a grocery store Thursday when three men in a car pulled up 
and fired seven or eight shots. Healy was struck once in the back. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Friday, Police Commissioner Lee Brown said the shooting of 
Healy was the result of a fight over drug turf. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said Diaz fired the shots from a 9-millimeter automatic. 
Garcia's role was not known. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place just blocks from Yankee Stadium in a drug-plagued 
neighborhood of the Bronx where robberies and thefts are common. In his novel 
"The Bonfire of the Vanities," author Tom Wolfe paints the area as so dangerous 
that even prosecutors fear for their own safety. 
</P>
<P>
Healy was appointed to the district attorney's office on Jan. 16, and was 
assigned to Bronx Criminal Court, where prosecutions usually involve minor 
charges that result in jail terms of a year or less, said Steven Reed, a 
spokesman for District Attorney Robert Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a former state senator, 49-year-old Vander Beatty, was fatally 
shot in his office in the Brooklyn borough. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty, a Democrat who left the state Senate after being convicted of forgery 
and racketeering in 1984 and served 19 months in prison, was shot once in the 
head at his office. Police said he was killed by an unidentified man who drove 
away. 
</P>
<P>
The car the gunman used was found parked a few blocks away from Beatty's 
reelection headquarters. Detectives were trying to find the car's owner, Arthur 
E. Flourney, 51, a retired Corrections Department captain, said police Officer 
Ralph St. Just.

REWARD FUND STARTED IN WAKE OF RACIAL VANDALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Religious organizations and neighbors of a black couple whose Agoura home was 
hit by racially motivated vandalism last week established a reward fund 
Saturday to help authorities capture those responsible for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you the outrage that was in my mind when I heard about this," 
said Frank Eiklor, president of a religious task force, who joined about 25 
others gathered Saturday at the home of the victims, Matilda and Szebelski 
(Larry) Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's residence was broken into Aug. 29 and vandalized for the second 
time in two years. The intruders slashed chairs, spray-painted walls and 
curtains, and destroyed photographs and appliances, causing an estimated 
$30,000 damage. They also overturned an aquarium and placed the fish in a bowl 
filled with manure, and spray-painted a red swastika on a wall. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said they suspect the vandalism was the 
work of skinheads, white racist youths who espouse a neo-Nazi ideology. A 
sheriff's spokesman said Saturday that no suspects have been arrested in 
connection with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Eiklor, a white Orange County minister who is president of the Southern 
California Task Force Against Anti-Semitism and Bigotry, said he organized 
Saturday's show of support for the Freemans because "unchallenged racism is a 
disgrace to the Christian church. We won't stand for this kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
"We're with you. We love you. We hurt with you," Eiklor told the Freemans. His 
organization contributed the first $700 to the reward fund. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, the amount had grown to $3,000. Glenn and Beverly Carlson, who 
live next door to the Freemans, set up the fund and contributed $500. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to start this anyway," Beverly Carlson said. "What happened was 
absolutely outrageous. The children around here are just terrified." 
</P>
<P>
Also showing support was Rabbi Aaron Kreigel, whose Temple Ner Maarav in Encino 
was vandalized with neo-Nazi graffiti last year, and Barbara and Jack Groeser, 
a Thousand Oaks couple who said they did not know the Freemans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 100% with you in stopping this now," Larry Freeman, a retired real estate 
broker, told those assembled in his living room. "I was wrong not to go public 
the first time." 
</P>
<P>
A similar incident occurred at the Freeman home in the predominantly white 
upper-middle-class neighborhood known as Saratoga Ranch in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Matilda Freeman, who said she feared speaking in public, wrote her remarks 
about the most recent incident on paper.

SMALL PLANES TAKE THE LOW ROAD TO FAIR 
</P>

<P>
Dawn had barely slipped across the Antelope Valley on Saturday when the distant 
humming began. 
</P>
<P>
A small knot of people, standing on the edge of a field of Joshua trees in 
Lancaster, squinted at the sky, tracking the source of the sound. 
</P>
<P>
It was not easy. The first light of the sun, still low over the valley, was so 
brilliant it had turned the metal backside of a nearby stop sign orange. 
</P>
<P>
But the spectators soon spotted seven homemade planes heading their way. One 
after another, the experimental planes gingerly landed on Challenger Way near 
Avenue H and taxied to a stop in front of a trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
The planes had taken off just a few minutes earlier from General William J. Fox 
Airfield about seven miles away. The planes' destination was the Antelope 
Valley Fair, but it was impossible to land there so the pilots had arranged 
with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to touch down on Challenger 
and taxi the last few blocks. 
</P>
<P>
The planes will be on display at the fair through Labor Day, and the pilots, 
members of the Antelope Valley chapter of the Experimental Aircraft Assn., an 
international group, will be on hand. Dick Rutan, who co-piloted the 
experimental Voyager aircraft on a 1986 record-breaking flight around the 
world, will sign autographs at the fair at noon today. 
</P>
<P>
Some among the group of three dozen curiosity seekers snapped pictures as the 
small planes slowed and zigzagged to a stop on the cracked asphalt road. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure was surprised when I saw them land on the street," said Fe Morante, a 
Lancaster resident. "I wish we'd have more things like this happening here." 
</P>
<P>
The landings were flawless, but one sheriff's deputy was spooked when a skinny 
white plane taxied near his squad car. 
</P>
<P>
"That was pretty close," shouted another deputy. "You might want to move your 
car." 
</P>
<P>
The deputies escorted the pilots several blocks -- past a supermarket, video 
store and a 7-Eleven -- and caught the attention of a few more early risers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are cute. They look like little toy planes coming down the street," said 
Vera High, who was out on her daily walk. 
</P>
<P>
The planes are classified as experimental because they are homemade and are not 
certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration. Many of the pilots sent 
away for kits and spent years assembling them in their garages. Most of the 
planes on display have room for just one or two people, and weigh and cost less 
than many used cars, the pilots said. 
</P>
<P>
"Building an airplane is probably the ultimate do-it-yourself project," said 
Roger Knight, who spent 5 1/2 years and $5,000 constructing his single-seater. 
From the front, Knight's plane, painted bright yellow and orange, looks like a 
cross between a grasshopper and ET, the extraterrestrial. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots, whose ranks include an optometrist, telephone repairman, engineer 
and a flight test pilot, are displaying their planes at the fair in hopes of 
encouraging others to take up the hobby. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very much like a contagious disease that has no cure," joked Jack 
Huffman, a retired electronics engineer with the Federal Aviation 
Administration. Not content with one plane, he is building two more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something anyone can do, you just have to want to," insisted Jerry 
Coates, the head of the Antelope Valley chapter. 
</P>
<P>
His colleagues adopted the same attitude when they talked as if landing their 
planes on a street was as easy as walking a dog. They just shrugged it off. 
</P>
<P>
Marlys St. Clair, who has lived with her husband's addiction to flying for more 
than 40 years, looked amused by the pilots' nonchalance. It's all part of the 
"macho pilot image," she confided. 
</P>
<P>
The truth, said St. Clair, standing next to her husband's sleek 
foam-and-fiberglass plane, is that "they are excited about showing their babies 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Rice, another pilot's wife, does more than just tolerate her husband's 
obsession with flying. She loves to ride in the back seat along with her 
husband's flying mascot, a stuffed Alf doll that wears goggles and a leather 
aviator cap. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said she had gone through two husbands "who wouldn't get off their duffs 
to do anything" before she met her aviation tinkerer. During the four years it 
took to assemble the plane, she lived with the engine in her den and other 
airplane parts scattered throughout the house. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn to poke little flowers in it to make it into a conversation piece," 
Rice said.

GI'S LETTER BRINGS MIDEAST FACE-OFF HOME; 
</P>
<P>
A FULLERTON FAMILY LEARNS WAR HAS A WAY OF PUTTING THINGS QUICKLY IN 
PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One way the Mideast crisis is striking home in Orange County is that a support 
group for families of troops stationed in Saudi Arabia has been meeting. Among 
them are Dee and Ronnie Muir of Fullerton, parents of 20-year-old Robbie Muir, 
a paratrooper in the Army's 82nd Airborne Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Muirs' observations and communications with their son provide a fascinating 
kind of "home-front watch" to supplement the news and commentary that comes 
daily from world leaders and military and diplomatic analysts. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington last week, policy makers were debating what the best course of 
action in the Iraq conflict would be from here on out -- whether to try to 
replace Saddam Hussein or to be satisfied with Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and 
the protection of Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
But it is unlikely that any of the participants in those high-level 
conversations will hear anything more to the point than the observation of 
Ronnie Muir, who last week said simply that his son is "the line in the sand 
that President Bush has drawn. My son." 
</P>
<P>
The letters from Robbie himself are equally direct and simple in their 
assessment of a complex situation. In his last telephone conversation before 
leaving, the young soldier had expressed his love for his parents and asked 
forgiveness for anything he might have done wrong. It was a moment of 
recognition in a young life that there is the possibility that there might not 
be another chance to set life's record straight. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the short letter from the soldier that made reference to the 
threat of chemical warfare, an experience he had not faced while participating 
in the invasion of Panama. He wrote, "You have no idea what I feel like inside 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder the simple pleasures of life seemed so wonderful from a distant 
desert: He longed for a ride in a golf cart and a root beer float. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty is a young age to be making peace with the world, but the prospect of 
war has a way of putting things quickly in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
The world has been getting plenty of analysis from the experts, but in some 
ways, nothing is more profound than the ordinary communication between a family 
and a son at the front.

POLICE ARRESTING THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Chief Paul Walters ("Fixing Public's Broken Windows," 
Commentary, Aug. 28) states that "the issue the community of Santa Ana is 
facing is one of crime and disorder." Yet the issue the homeless in Santa Ana 
face is arrest and harassment by his overzealous "peace" officers. 
</P>
<P>
Being homeless, I submit, is not a crime. To arrest, intimidate and chain these 
people to park benches for six hours and to number them like cattle is totally 
uncalled for. Even if, in some instances, the alleged charges of loitering, 
pandering and urinating in public are true, do such "crimes" warrant such 
demeaning behavior? 
</P>
<P>
Such disgraceful police behavior as this reminds one of the remark of Dietrich 
Bonhoeffer, the martyred Lutheran minister put to death by the Nazis: "They 
came for the Jews, and I did not object, as I was not a Jew; they came for the 
Catholics, and I did not object, as I was not a Catholic. Finally, they came 
for me, and there was no one left to object." 
</P>
<P>
The Civic Center disorder may be a "broken window" needing repair, but rounding 
up the destitute and indigent on trumped-up charges of littering, etc., is not 
the answer. Minorities and the downtrodden would appear to be the targets here. 
The result is fear and hatred toward the Police Department by a vast majority 
of the Latino community in Santa Ana.

THE USE OF ANTI-RACKETEERING LAW TO FIGHT SPEEDING TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was a little upset as I read that Seal Beach lawyer Ernest J. Franceschi Jr. 
had filed a federal case against Huntington Beach ("Huntington Beach Open to 
Anti-Racketeering Suit," Aug. 23) for allegedly operating an illegal speed 
trap. 
</P>
<P>
As a Huntington Beach taxpayer, I was dismayed to see my tax dollars used to 
fight Franceschi's self-serving and frivolous lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Franceschi never denied that he was guilty of speeding the three times he was 
cited; he hid behind a legal technicality to get off. Like most, when cited I 
was guilty and I paid my fines. 
</P>
<P>
I was outraged when I took a look at the photograph of Franceschi's new Porsche 
and realized his license plates are from Oregon! 
</P>
<P>
I work and live here and, therefore, pay for California license plates, which 
are much more expensive than Oregon registration. What puts Franceschi above 
the laws that the rest of us have to obey?

A PLEA TO LIMIT PURCHASE OF HANDGUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County residents are aware by now of the senseless murder Aug. 19 of three 
young men at the store in Tustin where they worked. Our son's close friend, 
Russell (Rusty) Williams, was one of the victims. We and the community have 
suffered a heartbreaking loss by his death. 
</P>
<P>
Their murder by a handgun fired at close range is alleged to have been 
committed by a former fellow employee at the store, who had earlier borrowed 
the weapon from another employee and then returned it the same night as the 
triple slaying. As easy as that. Pull a trigger four times. Three irreplaceable 
lives ended. 
</P>
<P>
By necessity, the Revolution was fought by volunteers from armed state militias 
called up by the Continental Congress to secure our independence from an 
oppressive England. In 1791, when the Bill of Rights was enacted, state 
militias made up the only standing army the nation could call upon to defend 
itself. Thus, the Second Amendment specifically coupled the "right to keep and 
bear arms" with "a well-regulated militia being necessary for the security of a 
free state." 
</P>
<P>
The founding fathers' necessity has become our tragic burden. According to 
statistics, more than 30,000 Americans are killed by guns each year. Such 
numbers reveal social insanity. 
</P>
<P>
If citizens really want to reduce this slaughter, they should write their 
lawmakers, particularly local congressmen, expressing their outrage. Ask about 
their stand on the Brady Bill, HR 467. It mandates a short waiting period 
before a buyer can purchase a gun. 
</P>
<P>
If America can remove millions of Tylenol bottles from store counters because 
of seven poisoned users in October, 1982, and at enormous cost one month later 
require all non-prescription drugs to be in tamper-proof containers, it surely 
can do something to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of just anybody who 
wants to own or use a gun. A letter now might save some other young Rusty 
later.

POOR KIDS MUST EAT IN SUMMERTIME TOO; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY SHOULD SUBSIDIZE MEALS WHEN SCHOOL'S OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is now September, and soon schools on traditional schedules will reopen 
after summer vacation. That's good news for many thousands of children in 
Orange County who, during school sessions, are fed lunch through a federal 
assistance program but are not when school is out. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the poverty of many of its neighborhoods, Orange County is the only 
urban county in the state in which there is no federal lunch program in 
operation for indigent children while they are out of school. That shouldn't be 
so. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 52,000 children in Orange County receive free lunches or lunch 
subsidies during school sessions through a program funded by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. When school is out, the USDA makes available similar 
programs to agencies that service areas in which schools subsidize meals for 
50% or more of their students. Such lunches also are available in other 
counties where schools are year-round, not just in summer months but also in 
the so-called "off-track" weeks between sessions. 
</P>
<P>
But no agency yet has taken advantage of the program in Orange County. As a 
result, both the USDA and California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA), an 
anti-poverty group, are targeting Orange County, hoping to bring a 
subsidized-meals program on line in the next year. The end of this summer is a 
good time to be planning for next. 
</P>
<P>
While Orange County's image is one of affluence, there are portions of Santa 
Ana, Garden Grove and several other cities with an underclass of impoverished 
families. The children from these families many times eat their only good meal 
of the day at school. When they are on school breaks, however, nothing magical 
happens to replace that meal. Food banks in these areas report that it is not 
unusual to have these hungry children show up at their agencies looking for 
something to eat. It is heartbreaking, they say, to turn them away. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the county's ability to respond to the needs of poor families seems 
to diminish with each budgetary year. This is why the USDA program is 
especially needed now. 
</P>
<P>
Why then do no such programs exist in Orange County? The reasons are many. 
While it seems hard to believe, officials at school districts in poverty areas 
said they haven't noticed much of a demand. Meanwhile, nonprofit agencies -- 
eligible to provide meals programs for the first time in nearly a decade -- 
said they are discouraged by the applications and daunting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
No such agencies in Orange County, and only six in the state, completed 
applications in time to begin programs this year. A few, including the 
Salvation Army of Anaheim, are determined to be ready by 1991. Meanwhile, CRLA 
is counseling agencies on how to apply and is working with the USDA to simplify 
rules. The Orange County Hunger Coalition has also been organizing for months 
to help agencies gear up programs. 
</P>
<P>
Other urban areas in California long ago worked through the initial 
difficulties of establishing meal-subsidy programs during school breaks. In Los 
Angeles, for example, the school district's 18-year-old lunch program serves an 
average of 34,000 meals a day. And Riverside's Parks and Recreation Department 
for 17 years has operated a lunch program that on a typical summer day serves 
1,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Day will mark the traditional end of summer. But Orange County needs a 
major commitment to provide children's lunch programs in the future. Let's make 
sure that such programs are in operation by next summer.

UMBERG'S OCCUPATION AND PRINGLE SUPPORTERS' LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The current controversy over the ballot designation of Thomas Umberg "Pringle 
Partisans Sue Umberg Over His Title on Ballot" (Aug. 23), has overtones of 
"Alice in Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
At the time Umberg filed his campaign papers and selected a ballot designation, 
he was employed as an assistant U.S. attorney. Because of the law, he had to 
resign that position in order to run, and his resignation letter was being 
processed. 
</P>
<P>
However, as of the date on the filing of the campaign papers, his designation 
was completely accurate. 
</P>
<P>
According to the logic of Curt Pringle's lawsuit, it would appear that Umberg 
should have used a crystal ball and designated himself as "unemployed."

UMBERG'S OCCUPATION AND PRINGLE SUPPORTERS' LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quoting from the article "Pringle Partisans Sue Umberg Over His Title on 
Ballot" (Aug. 23): "The squeaker of a victory, however, was immediately marred 
by accusations that the Republicans had used dirty tricks to scare away 
potential Democratic voters by posting guards at several heavily Latino 
precincts in Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
As many times as I have read the above accusations, I have never heard an 
explanation as to how the Democrats arrived at the conclusion that the security 
guards were there to scare them away. 
</P>
<P>
If a person is doing nothing wrong, why is there any reason to be intimidated 
or fearful of a security guard?

CAN OFFICIALS AND DEVELOPERS TALK? SURE, JUST DO IT IN PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I recently appeared before the Planning Commission on a controversial zoning 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was rather complicated with many subtleties so I sought Planning 
Commissioner Douglas Leavenworth's counsel prior to the public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the issue was very important to 65 homeowners, it wasn't a major 
item in the specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Mr. Leavenworth graciously extended to me a two-hour conference 
in order to review the many aspects of this issue. Later, the matter was 
satisfactorily settled before the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
I am impressed with Commissioner Leavenworth's sincerity, integrity, and his 
willingness to take extra time to fully understand the many issues on which he 
must make decisions. Needless to say, I was disappointed and distressed to read 
your editorial (Aug. 17) claiming Commissioner Leavenworth has an "attitude 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Are we talking about the same planning commissioner -- one who has an excellent 
reputation for serving Orange County diligently and honestly for many years? 
</P>
<P>
How could such a person be defiant or insensitive to the responsibilities and 
public trust of his position? 
</P>
<P>
I applaud The Times' efforts to uncover and clean up the self-serving and 
cheating politicians or bureaucrats. However, our system works because of the 
honesty and integrity of the majority of the people in our political and 
bureaucratic structure who day in and day out carry on the responsibilities of 
their positions for the good of our community. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Leavenworth is in the forefront of this group. We would indeed be 
the loser if he was replaced for a minor oversight which has now been 
corrected.

LEADERS OF TOMORROW LEARN TO OVERCOME FEAR OF DIVERSITY; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH-SCHOOL SENIORS FROM DIVERSE ETHNIC AND SOCIAL BACKGROUNDS SPEND 10 DAYS AT 
UC IRVINE IN A 'BOOT CAMP OF THE MIND.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERARDO MOUET, Gerardo Mouet was director of the KSR program and assistant 
director of the educational opportunity program at UC Irvine and is now 
outreach coordinator for Santa Ana. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost daily the media reports incidents of racial violence. For example, a 
recent story appeared about a 15-year-old Garden Grove high school student who 
endured 10 hours of surgery to sew the left side of her face back together. Her 
injuries were the result of what she says was a racially motivated attack with 
baseball bats and a broken piece of mirror. If the attackers had looked into 
that mirror, they would have seen yet another grotesque example of behavior 
resulting from the fear of diversity in opinion, race, culture or gender. 
</P>
<P>
Whether one lives in Baghdad, Moscow, Washington or Orange County, no one is 
immune to destructive prejudice. The challenge of diversity requires leaders 
who are able to resist the temptation to create a false unity with demagogic 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
To better nurture such responsible leadership, UC Irvine and the Orange County 
chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews became partners in 
1985 to develop and coordinate the Knowledge and Social Responsibility Program. 
The idea for the program was developed during a discussion between Manuel 
Gomez, UCI assistant vice chancellor for student affirmative action, and Harlan 
Anderson, executive director of the NCCJ in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
KSR is now a summer leadership development program for a diverse group of high 
school seniors who are selected to live in the UCI dorms for 10 days to 
experience a curriculum that has been described as a "boot camp of the mind." 
It is designed to help identify young leaders, to assist them in obtaining a 
greater vision of their potential and their responsibility in a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Tolerance and appreciation of diversity are the most important themes in the 
KSR program. As the concept of a common enemy continues to dissipate in our 
post-Cold War society, we can no longer direct our frustrations and anger 
toward an "evil empire." Our educators and leaders need to help society 
overcome the anxiety caused by differences in people. If this does not happen, 
our fears of difference may be turned against others within our own borders. As 
a leadership development program, KSR deals directly with this pivotal societal 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Observers of the program were amazed that, in just 10 days, 48 teen-agers from 
30 high schools and a variety of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds could so 
effectively overcome stereotypes. They witnessed a human "chain-reaction" that 
fused people through friendship and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
As the students interacted with each other in these activities, the walls of 
intolerance fell. The level of acceptance of different perspectives increased 
as the students developed a love of learning. Toward the end of the program, a 
student participant wrote, "I was personally changed by this experience because 
of being around so many different kinds of people with so many different 
views." 
</P>
<P>
The heart of leadership development is to awaken the spirit of inquiry, to 
encourage intercultural understanding, to teach democratic values, and to 
increase awareness of one's views and relationships with others. 
</P>
<P>
The KSR program exists to provide the opportunity for students to interact and 
to explore how they can contribute to a culturally diverse society. There are 
no grades or examinations to pass. The program explores issues such as poverty, 
homelessness, drug abuse, housing discrimination, power of the media, racism, 
affirmative action, undocumented workers, feminism, South Africa, Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union; it does this by treating students as scholars and 
bringing them into direct contact with prominent scholars in their respective 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
The students participate in small group discussions where they are encouraged 
to express their thoughts and concerns and share their insights about human 
nature and solutions to worldwide problems. Learning through discussion can be 
very effective in exploring critical social issues. As one student noted, "At 
school we are given books, told to learn information and memorize it. Here, 
everything is questioned." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the complex controversies of our era, we need leaders who have the 
ability to think critically and to embrace diversity. The KSR students learn 
that solutions to social issues require the dedication and determination of 
many people working together. The students leave the program with more 
questions than when they began, with a respect for learning for its own sake, 
and with greater hope that their actions can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
A sound democracy needs leaders who are activists for positive change. After 
experiencing the KSR program, many students were motivated to lead organizing 
efforts to help homeless people and victims of natural and other disasters and 
to protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Leadership today, as defined by the many controversies of our time in our 
region, nation and the world, desperately requires an ability to deal with the 
differences they face. The values of our leaders will have an impact on our 
future. Our youth need to be given the opportunity to explore their values as 
they continue to acquire knowledge. The program offers that without focusing on 
specific ideologies, but rather on encouraging constructive involvement in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities can do more to 
integrate social responsibility into their curricula. As we teach reading, 
writing and arithmetic in our schools, we should add social responsibility as 
the fourth "R" to prepare budding leaders to meet the challenge of diversity.

'DEVELOPERS, SPARE THOSE TREES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Developers, Spare Those Trees" (Aug. 28): I agree wholeheartedly with 
Lorlaine Davis and her Trabuco Women's Club. I'm a marketing expert and I 
certainly recognize the signs. 
</P>
<P>
Darn right, folks, those developers are drooling over the thought of wiping out 
the last best area of Orange County's wilderness! Take my professional advice, 
protesters, fight these developers by using their own weapons and techniques 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
Their No. 1 selling point is the rural location. They intend to sell these 
clone-like homes by emphasizing the naturalness of the surroundings, no doubt 
claiming that the location will also enhance resale values. Baloney! In a few 
short years, the view in Trabuco will resemble that of Westminster or Garden 
Grove! Mile upon mile, an endless panorama of cloned homes, liquor stores and 
pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Get the word out, Trabuco Women's Club members. That "rural paradise" the home 
buyers think they're getting won't be there very long. 
</P>
<P>
Those who doubt this go to the Irvine Park/Santiago Road crossing and look 
northwest. The people on those hills paid about six times the normal cost for 
their homes with a rural view. That view is now paved over. 
</P>
<P>
I'd personally consider buying one of the proposed new homes in Trabuco Canyon 
a bad investment if my intent was to be living with natural surroundings.

DOUBLE TROUBLE FOR PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While his teammates left the field to grab a quick snack Saturday night in 
between games of their doubleheader against the Philadelphia Phillies, Padre 
reliever Greg Harris was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't in the trainer's room. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Nope, he wasn't in the bathroom, either. 
</P>
<P>
Lurking beneath the stands, screaming in frustration where nary a soul could 
hear him, was Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to scream and holler in front of everybody," Harris said. "I 
wanted to get away without hurting anybody's feelings and without showing 
anyone up." 
</P>
<P>
Yes sir, that about sums up 
</P>
<P>
every player's feelings in the Padre clubhouse these days, particularly after 
the team was swept in a doubleheader by the Phillies, 3-2 in 10 innings and 
2-1, in front of a crowd of 25,008 at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The pair of defeats gave the Padres (60-71) five in a row and left them 16 
games behind the division-leading Cincinnati Reds. For the first time, it has 
become mathematically impossible for the Padres to win the division if the Reds 
play just .500 baseball the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the whole experience is frustrating to all of us," said Manager Greg 
Riddoch, slumped in his chair. "We're all contributing to this mess. I feel 
helpless right now, I really do. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing is sleepless nights. Losing is laying awake wondering what we can do to 
solve the problem, racking your brain night after night. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you, losing ain't fun." 
</P>
<P>
"These are the dog days, boy." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard enough for Riddoch just to motivate his team when they're hopelessly 
out of the race and struggling just to hang onto fourth place, one-half game 
ahead of Houston. But when there's the unrest in the front office and players 
publicly complaining about their contract situations, well, it's little wonder 
Riddoch finds himself mentally exhausted before the first pitch is even thrown 
most days. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 30 days left in this season," Riddoch said, "and guys are wondering 
about next season. 'I'm signed. I'm not signed.' There are a lot of variables, 
and I tell you, it's not easy right now." 
</P>
<P>
Padre first baseman Jack Clark became the latest to publicly complain about his 
contract Friday, chastising management for offering him a one-year contract for 
about $2.5 million, with an option year. Clark, according to sources, is 
seeking a three-year contract for about $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon, Padre vice president/baseball operations, responded publicly 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you see a big deal (contract) pulled off in a day?" McKeon said. 
"These things take time. You can't expect to do the deal overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to start somewhere, and we're going to continue to talk. We're 
going to do everything we can to get it done, if we can get it done. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is we're hopeful, but we're not going to negotiate through the 
media." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are thus unraveling, their offensive production tumbling more 
rapidly than the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres actually outdid themselves Saturday, scoring all of three runs and 
getting nine hits in a doubleheader against the likes of Jason Grimsley and 
Tommy Greene. 
</P>
<P>
Just what kind of credentials did these Phillie pitchers bring into this 
exhilarating doubleheader, which lasted 6 hours 14 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Well, they entered the night with one career victory apiece; Greene owned a 
7.71 ERA, Grimsley yielding a .299 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
So what do the Padres do against these guys? 
</P>
<P>
They batted .145 with one extra-base hit, going one for 17 with runners in 
scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a regular offensive machine, aren't we?" Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see, in the opening game, Grimsley walked four batters, gave up a 
sacrifice fly, a single and two stolen bases, all in the first inning. The 
Padres came away with two runs and obtained two hits the rest of the game, 
never again touching third base. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Roberto Alomar hit the first pitch for a home run, and that 
was the extent of their offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like after we score some runs," Padre outfielder Shawn Abner said, 
"that's it. We can't get things going after that." 
</P>
<P>
Really, the Padres haven't gotten a whole lot going the whole trip, wasting 
night after night of brilliant pitching, yielding a 2.72 ERA. They've scored 
just 15 runs in nine games, batting a colossal .204 and hitting .133 with 
runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, John Kruk of the Phillies has produced almost as much offense by himself 
against the Padres, driving in the winning run in the 10th inning of the first 
game off Harris, then driving in the tying run off Derek Lilliquist in the 
sixth inning of the second and scoring the winning run in the eighth off 
reliever Rich Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a one-man wrecking crew, hasn't he?" Riddoch said. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well, what's a team to do but sleep it off and hope somehow they can find a 
way to end the slump today when the Padres conclude their 10-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a really tough time for us right now," Harris said. "This is where men 
become men, stand up and do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to start playing better than this. If we don't, I'm telling you, 
it's going to be real hard sleeping at night this winter." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch's sleeping habits, however, have already been affected. 
</P>
<P>
He was planning to spend the night Saturday on the couch in the manager's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be up all night thinking about this one, anyway," Riddoch said. 
</P>
<P>
It has been that kind of season. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon said that he did not receive a single telephone call from another 
club before Friday's deadline when playoff rosters became frozen and doesn't 
expect to make a deal before the end of the season. "It's hard to make a deal 
when there's no interest," McKeon said. . . . Derek Lilliquist's shutout streak 
of 19 innings ended in the sixth when John Kruk doubled to center, scoring Von 
Hayes. . . . Hmm, so you say the club's trying to save money? Tim Flannery, 
former Padre infielder, took a flight into Philadelphia on Friday, preparing to 
fill in and broadcast Saturday's game for Jerry Coleman. One problem. No one 
told Flannery that Coleman was staying put this weekend and not broadcasting 
for CBS Radio. So Flannery took a flight right back to San Diego Saturday 
afternoon without uttering a sound for the Padre broadcast team. . . . Phillie 
center fielder Lenny Dykstra on being told that Willie McGee will be eligible 
to win the National League batting title with his .335 average despite being 
traded to Oakland. "If you have enough at-bats, what's the difference if you 
leave the league or you get hurt. He did put his time in, right? Not by his 
choice, but he did take the easy way out." . . . Dykstra, on the reaction to 
his signing a three-year, $7.3-million contract: "People are saying, 'How can 
you give this guy that kind of money.' I look at those people like, 'What are 
you talking about? How can you not give this guy that kind of money?' I'm 
leading the league in four categories. I'm leading this team in, like, 12. I 
look at those people like, 'What are you talking about. When you play well, you 
earn a lot of money." . . . The Phillies and Yankees are the only teams in the 
major leagues who don't have a pitcher with at least 10 victories. . . . The 
Padres' games against the San Francisco Giants on Monday and Tuesday have each 
been moved back to 7:35 p.m. to accommodate ESPN. . . . Padre reliever Craig 
Lefferts was selected as Rolaid's National League Reliever of the Month by 
saving eight games in nine opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Infielders Paul Faries and Joey Cora of the triple-A Las Vegas club will join 
the Padres on Monday. . . . Minor league data: First baseman Rob Nelson was 
selected as the player of the month for triple-Las Vegas, batting .327 with 
nine homers and 35 RBIs; Ricky Bones was pitcher of the month for Las Vegas 
with a 2-1 record and 3.46 ERA. Second baseman Dean Kelley, outfielder Mike 
Humphries and Bones, who also played in double-A Wichita, were selected to the 
Texas League All-Star team. Humphries (.277, 17 homers, 79 RBIs) also was 
selected as Wichita's player of the year, and Bones (6-4, 3.48 ERA) was 
selected as pitcher of the year. Third baseman Dave Staton was Class A 
Riverside's player of the year with a .290 batting average, 20 homers and 64 
RBIs; Brian Harrison was Riverside's pitcher of the year with a 5-2 record, 18 
saves, and 1.19 ERA.

MORNING BRIEFING: HORSES AWAITING AIR TRANSPORT ARE SURELY MISSING THE BOAT

<P>
Trotters and pacers scheduled to run at Los Alamitos continue to get bumped . . 
. from their flights west. 
</P>
<P>
Morning Briefing recently noted pacing mare Time For Toni's stand-by status, 
which arose when her cargo plane from New York was rerouted to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, three more horses have had to wait because their planes were used 
for military transport to the Middle East. One trotter had to be scratched from 
a $15,000 event last Tuesday but will go to the post Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The trotter's name: I Envy Noah. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: In 1989-90, Michael Jordan won his fourth consecutive NBA scoring 
championship, moving closer to Wilt Chamberlain, who won seven in a row from 
1960-66. Which four players won three in a row? 
</P>
<P>
"A Rison in the Sun": The Atlanta Journal keeps asking for it. Not satisfied 
with the 1,168 responses to its request for new Falcon slogans, the paper 
recently ran a contest to name wide receiver Andre Rison's touchdown dance. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, the deadline was Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
First prize was two Falcon season tickets. And no wisecracks about second prize 
being four. 
</P>
<P>
No Bo, no Boz, no Boss: In its list of the 100 most influential Americans of 
the 20th Century, a special issue of Life magazine includes four from the world 
of sport: Muhammad Ali, Billie Jean King, Jackie Robinson and Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine consulted with a group of 60 historians and other experts. Albert 
Einstein was one of the 17 choices from science and medicine, and Elvis Presley 
was one of seven musicians, along with Louis Armstrong, Irving Berlin, Leonard 
Bernstein, Bing Crosby, Bob Dylan and Richard Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mary Steinbauer, editor of the special issue: "It's a list of the most 
influential people of the past 100 years, not the most famous. In making our 
selections we looked at how our lives would be different if each of our 
honorees didn't live." 
</P>
<P>
Call it the 4-and-7: Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle recently 
previewed the 1990 Texas Christian football team. He asked quarterback Matt 
Vogler, who is challenging Leon Clay for the starting job, to describe Coach 
Jim Wacker's offense. 
</P>
<P>
Said Vogler: "Well, it's . . . uh . . . well, it's sort of a wide-open, 
controlled thing. It used to be a run-and-shoot with a veer, but we don't 
really use the veer part anymore, so we're not a 'triple shoot' anymore. But 
we're not a run-and-shoot, either. Not at all. But we are, sort of. . . . Well, 
let's put it this way, we're a passing offense." 
</P>
<P>
Add TCU offense: Feigen got this answer from starting quarterback Clay: "Well, 
uh, that's a hard question. It's sort of an offbeat run-and-shoot. Sort of." 
</P>
<P>
Last add TCU offense: Feigen then went to freshman Tim Schade, the third-team 
quarterback and Coach Wacker's nephew. 
</P>
<P>
Said Schade: "I don't know what to call it. I like it, though." 
</P>
<P>
Two-way Patriot: New England Patriot linebacker Ed Reynolds, a member of the 
Army Reserve, recently was promoted to captain in a ceremony before an 
exhibition game against Cincinnati in Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Patriots would not have to pay him, and although he said that he 
would be willing to forgo his $265,000 salary, team officials announced last 
week that Reynolds would continue to receive his football checks if his unit 
were called to duty.

MIAMI HURRICANES SHOULD STORM TO TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY MCKEE, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Schnellenberger, Jimmy Johnson, Dennis Erickson: No one misses a beat. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Hurricanes, always a little ostentatious, should add another national 
title to the three that Schnellenberger, Johnson and Erickson won in the past 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
The team of the 1980s moves into the 1990s as the defending national champion. 
It will take a great effort to dethrone it. 
</P>
<P>
"My expectations are high, so the pressure continues every year," said 
Erickson, who coached the Hurricanes to the 1989 national title in his first 
year at the school. "Realistically, we know we are not going to win the 
national championship every year. But the pressure is still there." 
</P>
<P>
And so is the ability. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1: MIAMI. Quarterback Craig Erickson, a prime Heisman Trophy candidate, is 
one of eight returning starters on offense. He'll hand off to fullback Leonard 
Conley and pass to Randal Hill, Wesley Carroll and Rob Chudzinski. 
</P>
<P>
The defense, which held opponents to 9.3 points per game, will be younger, but 
defensive tackle Russell Maryland is back to anchor the line. The Hurricanes 
are deep in linebackers and experienced on the corners. And then there is 
Carlos Hureta, one of the best placekickers in the country. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2: NOTRE DAME. The Irish will break in a new quarterback (Rick Mirer, a 
6-foot-3, 212- pound sophomore), a new offense (Mirer is a classic pocket 
passer) and try to put out rumors fired up by a Sports Illustrated article that 
suggests widespread use of steroids on the team. 
</P>
<P>
The offense will miss five starters, including QB Tony Rice. But junior flanker 
Raghib Ismail is ready to fly. On defense, only one veteran returns to the 
secondary, but two players are back from the 1988 championship team: senior 
defensive tackle George Williams from academic suspension and senior linebacker 
Michael Stonebreaker after a disciplinary suspension. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3: AUBURN. The Sporting News picked the Tigers to be No. 1. They could pull 
it off, with seven home games and nemesis Alabama in Birmingham. Coach Pat Dye 
has a veteran line to protect new quarterback Frank McIntosh and a "big play" 
defense, with nose guard Walter Tate (6-2, 306) and tackles David Rocker (6-4, 
264) and Fernando Horn (6-5, 270). 
</P>
<P>
No. 4: COLORADO. QB Sal Aunese died a year ago. His ghost is at rest. If the 
Buffaloes challenge for the national title, they'll do it on their own by 
working overtime, following a 31-31 tie with Tennessee. QB Darian Hagan, a 
Heisman candidate, tailback Eric Bieniemy and linebackers Alfred Williams and 
Kanavis McGhee excel. 
</P>
<P>
No. 5: FLORIDA STATE. Coach Bobby Bowden has a new lifetime contract, but hopes 
it doesn't take that long to get a victory in a season opener. The last two 
years Bowden saw title hopes crushed by opening losses. Maybe this year the 
Seminoles can get it right against East Carolina. Bowden's team has talent, but 
little experience. He says that's better than no talent and a lot of 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6: NEBRASKA. The only question is quarterback, where juniors Mickey Joseph 
and Mike Grant are dueling for the position vacated by Gerry Gdowski. The 
backfield is set with junior Leodis Flowers and Terry Rodgers, the son of 
former Nebraska Heisman winner Johnny Rodgers. The defense is anchored by 
linemen Kenny Walker and Joe Sims. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7: VIRGINIA. With senior QB Shawn Moore and junior wide receiver Herman 
Moore, the Cavs expect more than last season's tie for the Atlantic Coast 
Conference title. It has taken coach George Welsh eight years, but he has 
finally turned the Cavaliers into a powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
No. 8: HOUSTON. Defense? Who cares? Coach Jack Pardee is gone, but his 
offensive coordinator, John Jenkins, is in command. Junior QB David Klingler 
has stepped in for the departed Andre Ware, last season's Heisman winner, and 
looks almost as good. The nation's leading receiver, Manny Hazard (12.91 yards 
per catch), is back. 
</P>
<P>
No. 9: MICHIGAN. Gary Moeller's coaching ability may remain a secret for a 
while. With the talent-laden squad Moeller has, he might not have to do much. 
Sophomore quarterback Elvis Grbac, who made an impressive debut last season, is 
full time now. Eight starters return on defense. 
</P>
<P>
No. 10: ILLINOIS. The Illini defense will be the key in the absence of 
quarterback Jeff George, who left Champaign for the NFL a year early. Nose 
tackle Moe Gardner, tackle Sean Streeter and linebacker Darrick Brownlow head 
the defense. Sophomore QB Jason Verduzco hopes to fill George's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
No. 11: WEST VIRGINIA. Underrated due to loss of quarterback Major Harris, the 
Mountaineers have a major change in personality going with senior QB Greg 
Jones. It's called team unity. Familiar faces: Rico Tyler, Garrett Ford and 
Mike Beasley. Eye grabber: senior offensive tackle John Ray, at 6-10 and 330 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
No. 12: CLEMSON. The Tigers have a big offensive line, a strong placekicker in 
Chris Gardocki, six starters back on defense and an untested quarterback in 
junior DeChane Cameron. The biggest question is how they will adjust to new 
coach Ken Hatfield. 
</P>
<P>
No. 13: ALABAMA. Coach Gene Stallings may feel blessed, given his inheritance: 
Fifteen starters, 10 on offense, from last year's Sugar Bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
No. 14: PITTSBURGH. Pitt fans think they've had the talent for a national title 
for years. They expect coach Paul Hackett to deliver. Standouts are sophomore 
quarterback Alex Van Pelt and linebacker Ricardo McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15: TENNESSEE. Last season Johnny Majors came within a hair of his second 
national title. This year, with 17 returning starters, the Vols remain close. 
</P>
<P>
No. 16: TEXAS A&amp;M. Senior halfback Darren Lewis has a shot at All-America 
status if he remains healthy. If he does, the Aggies have a shot at the 
Southwestern Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17: UCLA. Coach Terry Donahue is trying to forget last season's 3-7-1 
record. He's hired former offensive wiz Homer Smith to call signals. Three new 
defensive coaches, plus transfers Arnold Ale (LB from Notre Dame) and Mike 
Chalenski (DE from Pitt) won't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
No. 18: HAWAII. Senior QB Garrett Gabriel makes the offense go. The defense 
remains strong. Visitors will find no gold in Rainbows' end zone. 
</P>
<P>
No. 19: USC. QB Todd Marinovich and tailback Ricky Ervins will have to carry 
the load until the defense shapes up. 
</P>
<P>
No. 20: WASHINGTON. After 16 years with the Huskies, Coach Don James knows how 
to get the job done. If QB Mark Brunell works out, the defense will keep the 
Huskies in the Pac-10 race. 
</P>
<P>
No. 21: LOUISVILLE. Veteran QB Browning Nagel continues to lead the Cards 
toward coach Howard Schnellenberger's national championship dream. 
</P>
<P>
No. 22: OHIO STATE. Coach John Cooper better shape this team into a Big Ten 
contender or get ready to ship out. 
</P>
<P>
No. 23: BYU. The offense is ready with outstanding QB Ty Detmer and running 
back Matt Bellini. Time will tell if a defense will show up. 
</P>
<P>
No. 24: PENN STATE. It is good the Nittany Lions have a few years to restock 
for the Big Ten. Still, it is Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25: GEORGIA TECH. For the first time in his four years at Tech, coach Bobby 
Ross has a returning starter at quarterback -- sophomore Shawn Jones.

FOUR-TEAM RACE IS FORECAST IN ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, BALTIMORE SUN

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1980s two teams dominated the Atlantic Coast Conference in football: 
Maryland and Clemson won eight of the 10 league championships. 
</P>
<P>
But when the decade ended, there were signs that parity finally had arrived in 
the form of a four-team race that came down to the last weekend of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The signs are still there as the 1990 season begins. 
</P>
<P>
Though Virginia and Clemson are considered the favorites, and many believe that 
the victor of their Sept. 8 showdown in Charlottesville, Va., could be the 
league's champion, there are at least two other teams that are given a chance 
to play in the Florida Citrus Bowl on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt the league was very balanced," Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross 
said. "But I think this is the strongest the league has been in my nine years. 
It could be a six- or seven-team race." 
</P>
<P>
Ross might be overstating things a bit, but the man who coached Maryland to 
three straight ACC championships in the mid-80s might not be far off. The 
much-improved Yellow Jackets, who finished last year by winning seven of their 
last eight games, likely will be in the hunt. So, too, might Duke, which shared 
last year's title with the Virginia Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time in recent memory, the league is not so top-heavy. 
Clemson and Duke will need some time adjusting to new coaches Ken Hatfield and 
Barry Wilson, respectively, and Virginia will no longer be able to sneak up on 
anybody. Despite the improvements made by the Duke Blue Devils and the 
Cavaliers, however, the ACC is still not a powerhouse football league. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of ACC football definitely is getting better; the league is not 
just one step above, say, the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was at Appalachian State, you'd see some Southern Conference teams 
beating ACC teams all the time," North Carolina Coach Mack Brown said. "We beat 
Wake Forest one year and played North Carolina State very close. But you don't 
see that happen anymore. It's so much stronger than it used to be, and it's 
getting stronger every day." 
</P>
<P>
Brown should know. In his two years coaching at Chapel Hill, the Tar Heels have 
won only one ACC game (over Georgia Tech in 1988) and have had miserably 
identical 1-10 seasons. And so should Ross, whose team took its lumps until the 
middle of last season, before finishing a respectable 7-4. But the downfall of 
two of the league's former powers, North Carolina and Maryland, hasn't helped 
to improve the ACC's image on a national basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the league gets the respect it should," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
That much is clear. Consider this year's preseason rankings: While Clemson is 
nearly a consensus Top 10 team and was picked 10th by The Associated Press poll 
of writers and broadcasters, the lack of respect for Virginia is evident. 
Although the Cavaliers were selected 15th by the AP, the coaches picked George 
Welsh's team 21st. Then again, maybe the always pessimistic Welsh has a lot of 
friends on the selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
When speaking about Saturday's season opener at Kansas, Welsh sounded as if his 
Cavaliers were about to play one of the Big Eight's top three teams, not one 
that finished 4-7 last year. Bemoaning the rash of recent injuries, Welsh said, 
"We're not as well-prepared as we'd like. I say that every year, but we've had 
a lot of injuries to skill people and that gives you a lot of concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Injuries and academic problems have all but wiped out North Carolina State's 
chances. The Wolfpack, which was in the race last year until closing the season 
with four straight losses, has been decimated in the offensive backfield. Coach 
Dick Sheridan, who has done a masterful job of turning the program around, 
might have to be even more of a magician this season. But that doesn't mean 
Sheridan has ruled his team out of this year's race. 
</P>
<P>
"I never feel like we can or can't (win)," said Sheridan, whose team opens 
Saturday against Western Carolina. "But I've always approached the season with 
that goal of winning the ACC championship. That is our focus. We want to be a 
team capable of playing for a championship." 
</P>
<P>
What should make this year interesting is the high quality of quarterbacks 
around the league. Virginia's Shawn Moore, a senior, is being promoted for the 
Heisman Trophy, while sophomore Shawn Jones of Georgia Tech was last year's top 
ACC freshman. Maryland's Scott Zolak, a fifth-year senior who has played 
sparingly, is being greeted with anticipation in College Park. 
</P>
<P>
And, as a new decade begins, there is hope that ACC football will keep 
improving. There has been much talk about future expansion, with Florida State, 
Miami and Syracuse mentioned as possibilities. And it seems there is parity -- 
real, and not merely imagined in the minds of the ACC coaches.

RICHARDS LEADS NO. 18 PITT PAST OHIO, 35-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pittsburgh Coach Paul Hackett, who already had a perfect bowl-game coaching 
record, now has a perfect regular-season record. 
</P>
<P>
Curvin Richards ran for 119 yards and a touchdown and No. 18 Pitt scored on 
four of five first-half possessions Saturday as the Panthers beat Ohio 
University, 35-3, at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Hackett, a former assistant with USC and three NFL teams, was named to succeed 
the ousted Mike Gottfried just before Pitt beat Texas A&amp;M, 31-28, in the 
John Hancock Bowl last December. Hackett was the Panthers' offensive 
coordinator last season before being promoted. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt quarterback Alex Van Pelt, a sophomore, completed 10 of 13 passes for 151 
yards and a touchdown -- all in the first half -- and Richards ran for all but 
nine of his yards before halftime as Pitt built a 28-3 lead in the first game 
between the two schools in 88 years. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Lewis added a pair of short touchdowns as Pitt's starting offense, 
moving the ball at will against Ohio's undermanned defense, outgained the 
Bobcats 228-35 in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio, debuting under former Maine Coach Tom Lichtenberg, lost its 12th 
consecutive season opener. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew coming in we were going to be out-physicalled, which we were," 
Lichtenberg said. "Our kids played hard, but Pitt was bigger and stronger. I 
knew they were good and had good personnel. When they took out Richards and Van 
Pelt and their first teamers, I said, 'Thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Richards, a junior who ran for 2,510 yards in his first two seasons, carried 
five times for 47 yards as Pitt took the opening kickoff and drove 75 yards to 
score on Lewis' two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
After the Bobcats punted, Van Pelt, who broke Dan Marino's school single-season 
passing record last season, hit Olando Truitt on a 30-yard touchdown pass play 
midway through the period, making it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 West Virginia 35, Kent State 24 -- Jon Jones, a redshirt freshman 
running back, ran 32 yards for a touchdown on his first collegiate carry and 
the Mountaineers held off a Kent State rally for the victory at Morgantown, 
W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' run, with 6:17 left in the game, came after Kent State closed to 28-24 
on the passing and running of quarterback Joe Dalpra, who completed 15 of 32 
passes for 171 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett Ford, who ran for 98 yards in 14 carries, helped West Virginia get off 
to a quick start with a 57-yard touchdown on the Mountaineers' first play with 
13:11 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 21-10 at halftime, Dalpra led Kent State on a 15-play, 66-yard scoring 
drive to start the second half and make it 21-17, and with 9:57 left brought 
the Golden Flashes within 28-24 with a four-yard touchdown pass to Tony 
Gucciardo.

TENNIS PLAYERS TURNING PRO YOUNGER, TURNING OLD SOONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY JENKINS, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If tennis has lately taken on the fleeting quality of a video game, it's 
because a 14-year-old, Jennifer Capriati, is conservatively worth $5 million; a 
16-year-old, Monica Seles, challenges for the No. 1 ranking; and a 21-year-old, 
Steffi Graf, is made to feel old. These phenomenons are merely the latest 
instances in the ongoing debate of whether children are meant for everyday use 
in tennis. They also may be evidence that money and supercharged equipment have 
changed the game irrevocably. 
</P>
<P>
In the era of the prodigy, youths support their parents, adolescents sprint to 
the top of the world and tumble back down, teen-agers are sophisticated 
travelers to Paris yet have never been inside the Louvre. Aesthetically, they 
are moppets playing a power game with wide-body rackets that emphasize force 
over feel. They are better and younger all the time, but there is a growing 
consensus that their fast-forward careers may be shorter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see myself playing at 27, 28," Graf said recently. "At least I don't 
think so. It's what I already have a little bit in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
When the U.S. Open begins Monday at the National Tennis Center on the edge of 
New York City, 37-year-old Jimmy Connors, finally tired out after 20 straight 
appearances, will not be in the field for the first time since 1970. Meanwhile, 
18-year-old Michael Chang continues what he termed a "comeback" after 
fracturing his hip in December. Martina Navratilova, 33, still pursues the 
women's No. 1 ranking held by Graf, who won the Grand Slam at age 18 but is 
already harried by pressures and the two-fisted fledgling Seles. The reigning 
French Open champion is No. 3 and could be No. 1 by the end of the year with an 
Open title. 
</P>
<P>
Just who this new set is and what they represent still is being determined. 
"They don't talk," said one high-ranked veteran. Andre Agassi, the 20-year-old 
who has yet to break through with a major victory, nevertheless has a 
multi-million dollar clothing and shoe contract with Nike. His advertisements 
may be the best expression of the turn the game has taken, ear-splitting, 
staccato drums and a dizzying series of picture bites, flashes of hot lava 
acrylic. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like all I'm getting are glimpses," Billie Jean King said. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova doubts that any of the new crop will play into their 30s. She grew 
up playing tennis for only a few hours a week until she was 14 and began 
training seriously. "I think that's why I'm still around, quite frankly," she 
said. Graf turned professional at 13. In trying to explain her short-term view, 
she said she doesn't think she has Navratilova's stamina, faced with ambitious 
younger competition and spiraling pressures she says Navratilova's generation 
did not have to face. 
</P>
<P>
"I started at 13, 14 years old playing the tournaments all around, all year 
round," Graf said. "At her time there wasn't the competition there is now. 
There wasn't the pressure from the outside, the involvement of the sponsors, 
the press, everything around it. So I think that she still has some reserves 
that we, the younger players, won't have at 30, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
The inherent dangers in children turning professional and playing full 
schedules in any sport are, by now, well known: physical stress, mental burnout 
and distorted values. Tracy Austin, a 16-year-old U.S. Open champion in 1979 
and No. 1 in 1980, was by 1983 a victim of persistent back injuries. Andrea 
Jaeger turned pro in 1980 at 14, was a Wimbledon finalist in 1983 and ranked as 
high as No. 2. But by 1984 she was not only virtually inactive with arm and 
shoulder ailments, but ambivalently wavering between tennis and a college 
education. 
</P>
<P>
The same problems are present on the men's tour if to a slightly lesser degree, 
as players mature later. Chang, the youngest winner of the French at 17 last 
year, fractured his hip in December and is starting over, a respite from high 
expectations it turns out he may have needed. "I think it helped me a little 
bit," he said. "I can relax and just go out and play without having to worry 
about being labeled the French Open champion." 
</P>
<P>
Those syndromes do not have to be the norm: There is a wealth of new methods 
and ideas to combat them, from improved physical therapy to sports psychology, 
to rules limiting the number of tournaments younger players can enter. And by 
all accounts the group so dramatically represented by Seles and Capriati is 
better equipped, informed and adjusted to life on the circuit than former 
prodigies. "They're different," King said. "They've got it." 
</P>
<P>
Also in the clique are 18-year-old, No. 6-ranked Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of 
Spain, the '89 women's French champion; 19-year-old Australian Open finalist 
Mary Joe Fernandez of Miami, and 19-year-old Pete Sampras, who has risen from 
No. 56 to No. 12 this season. Among the traits they share are uncommonly 
well-developed physiques for their ages. Capriati is already 5-feet-6 and 130 
pounds. They also share composure, and a healthy sense of enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to be free of injuries, no problems, and just enjoy tennis," Seles 
said. "If I start not liking tennis or thinking about a lot of other things, 
then I think tennis will become difficult. For me right now it's fun, and when 
it's not fun I think I will stop. Whether it's two years or tomorrow, as long 
as I like it, as long as I enjoy, I will be on the court." 
</P>
<P>
But none of the new methods is as effective as common sense, a quality that 
often seems lacking. No matter how talented they are, there is something 
faintly disturbing about a group that carries schoolbooks to tournaments, 
particularly when the players in their 20s such as Graf and Gabriela Sabatini 
of Argentina, who has slipped from No. 3 to No. 5 this season, are struggling 
with the ramifications of starting so young. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say it's really strange at 21 to have to play so much younger 
girls," Graf mused after beating Capriati in the fourth round at Wimbledon. "I 
mean, I don't feel old. You realize that it's just weird." 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing like several million dollars to override common sense. Even 
before Capriati made her professional debut this spring at age 13 she signed 
widely publicized, million-dollar contracts with the Prince racket firm and the 
Italian clothing and shoe company Diadora. Her newest endorsement is with Oil 
of Olay, the skin cream that keeps you youthful. She has risen to No. 13 with a 
record of 32-8, including a semifinal appearance in the French Open. Seles has 
her own clothing line and just signed a new racket deal with Yonex, and her 
total earnings may exceed $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati and Seles profess to be ignorant of their worth. The bottom line on 
the money issue may be this: The great ones don't play for it. They play to 
win. "I mean, if I didn't feel that way, why should I even try for it, you 
know?" Capriati said. "I mean, that's the way I go into every tournament." 
Seles has a voracious seven victories in the 11 tournaments she has entered. At 
the beginning of last year she was not in the top 100, this year she has risen 
from No. 6 to No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"I never even look at it really," Seles said. "For me it's really just the 
tennis. More important, I would say, than anything else, is if I would know 
that in 10 years I can play perfect tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Yet their earning power separates today's players from yesterday's more than 
any other single development in the sport. And according to King, it may be a 
significant factor in abbreviating careers. "Let's face it, it's the money," 
she said. "They have choices even a lot of recent players didn't." In short, 
players no longer have to play to ensure their immediate livelihoods or 
long-term security, something even Navratilova still is trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Capriati's 14 and she's got her own shoe with her name on it," Navratilova 
said. "In 1974 I signed a deal with Etonic for $1,000 a year and I thought I 
was hot stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi has worked desperately to improve his strength and defends his somewhat 
underachieving record by saying he is developing at his own pace. Certainly he 
can take his time, with $3.5 million annually, including his own shoe, the Air 
Tech Challenge. But Connors wonders if money doesn't have its subtle effects. 
"I don't see a lot of guys who have it in them to grind it out day to day," he 
told the Associated Press. "I don't know, maybe it's too easy." 
</P>
<P>
With money has come the entourage, which for any given player can include 
parents, agent, coach, trainer, dietitian, shoe representative and bodyguard, a 
protective and potentially blinding ring. "Maybe I started it," Navratilova 
said wryly. "But at 14 I think you can go a little overboard." While money and 
the accompanying buffers can relieve pressure, they can also create it, leading 
to the "pushing" of a young player. The more significant the money and the 
larger the entourage, the more difficult it may be for players to make 
themselves heard. "You have to be able to say no," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
But Seles is at least one player who sees the furor as exaggerated. She lacks a 
noticeable entourage and appears to be a model of self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
"A person should have individuality on and off the court," she said. "It's hard 
because maybe you are pressured into some things by some people, but when you 
really think about it, it's totally your decision. Nobody has a say in it." 
</P>
<P>
That Capriati and Seles would capture the imaginations of little girls 
everywhere, and that their contracts would capture the imaginations of 
ambitious parents, was probably inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Before she became a pro, Capriati's coach, manager and father, Stefano, had her 
extensively tested at the Virginia Institute of Sports Medicine in an attempt 
to detect weak or trouble spots in her physique. According to Janet Sobol, the 
institute's director of rehabilitation, since Capriati's debut there has been a 
mad rush of parents and children to the testing facility. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't believe the number of parents with their 9-year-old kids," Sobol 
said. "And the only question they asked is, 'How did she compare to Jennifer?' 
It's depressing. A lot of these kids are being pushed. It's happening." 
</P>
<P>
Capriati's tests were performed in 1989 when she was 12. She scored extremely 
well in aerobic capacity and body fat percentage (12.8 percent), and did 42 
situps in one minute. But there was worrisome news also, with noticeable 
weakness in her external rotators and muscles surrounding the shoulders. She 
also showed some inflexibility in her hips, hamstrings and lower back, all 
common areas of weakness in young players. She was given a comprehensive set of 
exercises and stretching routines, which Pam Shriver could have used a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver was labeled a comer when she made the final of the U.S. Open in 1978 at 
15. Two years later she had recurring arm and shoulder problems, which have 
persisted. She skipped Wimbledon and will miss the U.S. Open, recovering from 
arthroscopic surgery. "By 16 or 17 I had the arm problem," she said. "The upper 
body strength in females gets real dicey. If I could do one thing differently 
it would be to get a heck of a lot stronger." 
</P>
<P>
None of that is to say the current crop of players isn't physically and 
mentally qualified to play the circuit, or that it is inherently wrong for them 
to be there. Chris Evert is the standard, debuting in the U.S. Open at 16 and 
retiring there last season after 18 years, a relentless example of how to 
handle pressure and avoid injury with her precise, flawless mechanics. What 
Sobol warns is that each case varies. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you get an extremely fit, healthy athlete like Jennifer," Sobol 
said. "But she's unusual, a very unusual kid both physically and 
psychologically. There's been a huge assault on her, but she's doing great, 
she's very balanced." 
</P>
<P>
According to Shriver, there is an easy way to tell if a junior should be 
permitted to play the circuit: the rankings. She maintained that if they don't 
show an ability to play among the top 50 consistently, they should be in 
school. "To me it's horrendous if you're anywhere from 14 to 19 and you're on 
the tour and you're not in the top half of the hundred." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, there is the danger that they play too much. Seles lost in the early 
rounds of her first three tournaments this year, suffering from a growing spurt 
and chronic stiff shoulder. In addition to the physical costs, there are the 
less tangible social ones. Capriati complained of homesickness and missing her 
dog during her 10-week stint in Europe, only to return to a loaded schedule. 
She is moving from her home and school in Saddlebrook, Fla., to a club in Boca 
Raton, where an endorsement deal has been negotiated for her. 
</P>
<P>
"The day after the Open finished in 1978 I was back in school," Shriver 
recalled. "I was a U.S. Open finalist, and a senior at a prep school. That was 
tough. It was a little weird. You definitely don't fit in with the rest of the 
group." 
</P>
<P>
King contends that injuries, particularly small, nagging ones, can be signs of 
more than just physical vulnerabilities. They can indicate mounting unhappiness 
and worries, particularly if parents have quit jobs or made significant 
sacrifices to train offspring, who are all too aware of what is riding on their 
successes and failures. She equates the tennis prodigy with the overachiever in 
school, who becomes too upset when he or she doesn't get straight A's. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of times what they're saying is, 'I'm overwhelmed,' " King said. 
</P>
<P>
Seles, Capriati, Chang, Agassi and their peers are not overwhelmed. They are 
overwhelming. They also are blessed with apparently cheerful, durable 
dispositions. "That may be a saving grace," said Mike Estep, coach of Sanchez 
Vicario. But coaches and parents alike are constantly mulling the fine line 
between letting gifted athletes pursue their ambition, and yet maintaining a 
reasonable lifestyle and broadening their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"As a coach I wouldn't have any moralistic judgment," Estep said. "But as a 
parent I think I'd feel some concern for the loss of those teen-age years. It 
will be a long time before we can judge the results. There are the Jaegers, and 
then there are the Everts, so I don't know. After the applause is gone and the 
career is finished, to be able to understand Eastern Europe or the stock market 
is valuable. To not be able to understand, you might be wasting a life." 
</P>
<P>
But there is a common refrain among the great young players that tennis is not 
costing them anything. For some, it may be an indispensable passion; Evert once 
called it "a need." Capriati steadfastly maintains she isn't missing a thing 
because she loves the sport so completely. Chang perhaps most eloquently summed 
up the curious enjoyment younger players are finding in both playing a game and 
building very adult careers in a high-pressure, disciplined arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I always take tennis seriously," he said. "When I play tennis, that, to me, is 
a pleasure. That's why I make it my career. To me, I don't feel like it's wrong 
to have an obsession to win something. The pleasure, I think, is in playing 
great points and being in the very tense situations, the great serve, the great 
volleys, the great returns, the great shots."

WINNING IS AMPLE MOTIVATION FOR EVERETT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERNIE WILSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Denver Broncos thought one afternoon was bad, think about what Jim 
Everett has to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
The better he gets, the tougher his job gets. 
</P>
<P>
Everett broke into the elite of NFL quarterbacks last season, leading the 
league with 29 touchdown passes and becoming one of only 10 quarterbacks in 
history to throw for more than 4,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But the number that mattered most for Everett and the Rams was 30-3, the score 
by which they lost the NFC Championship game to their Western Division rivals 
in San Francisco. The Rams have been been second-best to the 49ers since 1985, 
the last time they won the NFC West. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a letdown, such an emotional low, to have to end your season on such 
a low point, but I hope it's something that we can turn around," he said. 
"We're talking about dominating the games earlier so maybe we can have the 
home-field advantage so they have to go and do what we had to try and do." 
</P>
<P>
Entering his fifth NFL season at 27, Everett offers the Rams stability at a 
position that had seemed like a revolving door for Bert Jones, Pat Haden, Vince 
Ferragamo, Dieter Brock, Steve Bartkowski, Jeff Kemp ... even an aging Joe 
Namath. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all the difference in the world, to have one young guy to work things 
around," wide receiver Henry Ellard said. "I had a about five different 
quarterbacks in five years, and I wasn't able to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"When things are not going right, he gets people motivated. He'll do what needs 
to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Everett, meanwhile, is more concerned about motivating the Rams than he is 
playing in the shadow of Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing we have to do is believe in ourselves," he said. "What I'm 
talking about is getting better, believing that we are the best, acting like 
and doing the types of things a championship team would do. I'm just saying, 
'Be what you are.' I think the success around here is breeding more success." 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, to improve, the Rams would need to at least get to the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what second-best has been like, and that really doesn't sit so well," 
Everett said. "I think it's a common goal for our squad, and that's what has to 
happen for us to be right." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have reached the playoffs six of the last seven years, but only once 
as division champion, and only twice with a home-field advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Rams split the regular-season series with San Francisco, but 
then came a four-game losing streak and they finished 11-5. As a wild-card 
team, they had to travel to the East Coast twice, and then to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Everett led the Rams to come-from-behind road victories against San Francisco, 
New Orleans, Dallas, New England and against the New York Giants in the 
divisional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, my knock was we couldn't win the big game and we couldn't come back 
from behind," he said. "There were a lot of big games that we won and there's a 
lot of games we came back from behind. So I think I solved that knock. 
</P>
<P>
"The knock this year, is, of course, to finish the year with a win. That's what 
we're going for. We'll be able to come from behind. I'd like to see us dominate 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Everett completed 304 of 518 passes for a club-record 4,310 yards 
(Don Majkowski of Green Bay threw for 4,318). Everett was second to Montana on 
the NFC passing efficiency list. 
</P>
<P>
There's also another side of Everett that's developing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a fun guy," Ellard said. "He likes to play practical jokes on people. 
Sometimes a team needs that. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always trying to look for a way to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who grew up in Albuquerque, N.M., and went to Purdue, has settled into 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved down to Newport Beach my first two years here," he said. "It was a 
great place and all that, but I moved back up to Orange. It's a lot slower 
pace, a little bit more open, a little bit more secluded, and a lot more 
style." 
</P>
<P>
Everett has a six-year contract reportedly worth $15 million. He runs a charity 
foundation and wants to start a business. 
</P>
<P>
Rams coach John Robinson said he's impressed that Everett has been able to 
remain focused on football. 
</P>
<P>
"I think last year was a big year for him," he said. "He went from pretty good 
to real good and he became a celebrity last year and a millionaire, a couple 
times over each year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think sometimes maybe things change. A player's ability to focus on what 
they do becomes clouded. My impression of him is that that's not true. 
</P>
<P>
"He loves to play. I believe most of the great players are gym rats. They'd 
just as soon play basketball or ping pong or Nintendo or anything. Like Magic 
Johnson or Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Everett is that kind of guy, who gets genuine enjoyment out of games and 
competing. It isn't a means to an end, playing isn't a means to achieve fame or 
fortune, it's an end in itself." 
</P>
<P>
Everett laughed when told of Robinson's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me to take on Michael Jordan in golf, I'd do it," Everett said. "If 
you asked me to do something with Larry Bird, I'd do it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that the only thing I'm really good at probably, is throwing the 
ball, but I'm pretty good at a lot of different other things. I like to think 
that I'm better than I am, and do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I play on a basketball team and they let me play guard. I'm probably not the 
best guard, but I like doing it. I just love sports and the team aspect. I 
don't love all the rest of them like I do football, but I love playing them. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably couldn't exist with out the competitiveness."

CHAUMP IS DETERMINED TO REVIVE NAVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY BEMBRY, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ANNAPOLIS, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking a brief break from his task of reviving Navy football -- a chore he has 
devoted most of his energy to the past seven months -- Coach George Chaump 
recently reflected on life at Marshall University. 
</P>
<P>
"Every place I'd go in Huntington (W.Va.), I was known," said Chaump, who 
coached the Thundering Herd for four years before taking the Navy job. "No one 
asked me how to spell my name. Nobody asked for verification to cash a check. 
No one questioned anything. 
</P>
<P>
"People there had what they called 'Green Fever' -- they bled green. Football 
there was big." 
</P>
<P>
Here, Chaump shouldn't have to worry about being approached by strangers who 
bleed Navy blue blood. Navy football, to some, is about as big as curling. 
</P>
<P>
None of which phases Chaump. Hired to revive a struggling program, Chaump said 
he realizes that winning is the only way he'll get a following. And he plans to 
win now, not later, starting with the season opener on Sept. 8 against 
Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not talking about rebuilding. We're going to go on from here," said 
Chaump, sitting in his office, which is virtually unchanged from the days of 
his predecessor, Elliot Uzelac. "And I don't plan on having a losing season. I 
don't care how bad things are." 
</P>
<P>
"Bad" for Navy has meant seven straight years of losing football, with the best 
record in that span 4-6-1 in 1984. Enter Chaump, who has had one losing season 
in eight years of college coaching (57-32-2) and has a reputation for winning 
with a crowd-pleasing style. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have one piece of advice for Navy fans -- they better be in their seats 
before the game starts," said Mike Carey, president of Marshall's Quarterback 
Club. "George has an exciting brand of football. And he always does something 
exciting on the first play." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy brass is waiting for the excitement to start. 
</P>
<P>
"He and his staff are doing an excellent job," said Jack Lengyel, Navy's 
athletic director. "I'm very impressed with what I've seen. Morale is high, and 
everyone is looking forward to the start of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Tempering the excitement are everyone except, surprisingly, Chaump. At the 
start of fall camp, Chaump and his assistants were looking forward to whipping 
the team into shape for the opener. But since then injuries that have sidelined 
several projected starters. Offensive tackle Michael Davis (knee problems) and 
tailback Ivan Bullard (pulled stomach muscle) are out for four weeks, offensive 
guard Carl Voss (back surgery) will miss the season, and linebacker Beau Laskey 
(shoulder problems) is out indefinitely. Those injuries, and others, have 
quelled some of that exuberance Chaump felt. 
</P>
<P>
"After spring ball, I was hoping to get some offensive linemen back, but with 
losing two starters and being thin to begin with, I'm a little concerned," said 
the soft-spoken Chaump, an exasperated look on his face. "We need more time. I 
dread the thought of playing Virginia (Sept. 15) so early in the football 
season. If you want my opinion, the home opener is coming too soon." 
</P>
<P>
And when would he like to open? 
</P>
<P>
"How about December?" he said, laughing. "We don't have too much depth, and 
with the injuries, it's slowing us down. I never considered this many problems 
with injuries. It's just a bad rash at a time we need players in practice to 
learn the system." 
</P>
<P>
Chaump's system probably played a big part in his getting the Navy job. He 
favors a high-powered offense -- i.e. "passing" -- that should pull fans out of 
the doldrums they sank in watching the "run, run, run" which should please fans 
more than the running game that eventually ran Uzelac out of Annapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The players, apparently, also were in a funk. Looking back at spring practice, 
Chaump remembers a team that was "floundering and grasping" and lacking "a 
sense of unity." Now, he says, that has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven years without a winning record, you're going to flounder, you're going 
to grasp, you're going to doubt," Chaump said. "But by the end, I sensed there 
was the development of pride, team unity, emotion and excitement. The team 
started believing in themselves, and believing in their teammates. They seemed 
very, very confident." 
</P>
<P>
Just like their ever-confident coach, who said his passing attack will work 
even though similar schools -- Army, Air Force and The Citadel -- use the 
run-oriented wishbone because of their inability to attract top-notch 
quarterbacks or big offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard all the arguments, in addition to the fact that the wishbone is a 
ball-control offense that controls the clock, which keeps your defense off the 
field," Chaump said. "I think there's truth to all of this, but I don't 
necessarily buy it. If I didn't think we could win with the more wide-open 
attack, I certainly wouldn't have gone with it." 
</P>
<P>
There's no arguing with Chaump's success. In his first head coaching job, John 
Harris High School in Harrisburg, Pa., went 58-4 in six years, including four 
unbeaten seasons. He next spent 11 years as quarterback coach at Ohio State 
under Woody Hayes, coaching such players as Cornelius Green and Art Schlichter. 
Ohio State went 95-15-3 while Chaump was there. 
</P>
<P>
After that came the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the National Football League, where 
Chaump coached the offensive backfield -- including quarterback Doug Williams 
-- for three seasons under John McKay, when the team won its only two NFC 
Central Division titles. 
</P>
<P>
Chaump became a college head coach in 1982, leading Indiana (Pa.) University to 
a 24-16-1 record in four years. At Marshall, his four-year record was 33-16-1, 
including a berth in the 1987 Division I-AA final. 
</P>
<P>
With a record of winning at all levels (Indiana went 4-6 his first year, his 
only losing season), Chaump said he doesn't see why he can't win in Division 
I-A with Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a better feeling here then I had anywhere else, based on what I've seen 
the kids can do," Chaump said. "But there's a Catch-22 there because we play 
tougher people. But that's irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as differences in my approach to coaching, I've coached all levels -- 
even my daughter's softball teams -- and the drive to win is just about the 
same. There's no difference in the way I coach. When we played a championship 
game in girls softball, I had the same sleepless night and nervous morning 
before the game as I have now." 
</P>
<P>
Although Navy hasn't had a winning season since 1982 -- and has had just six in 
the past 22 -- Chaump said he feels no pressure from Navy backers. 
</P>
<P>
"The only pressure I feel is pressure I put on myself to prove we can win," 
Chaump said. "I get the feeling the people here just want a class operation. 
And even though they'd like to win, if things are going well and the football 
is entertaining and they could be proud of their team, they'd be happy. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't feel that way. I want to go out and win. I want to be a football 
team that's respected, a football team that's a class act. I think if we take 
care of those things, the wins will take care of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
With winning comes support. Chaump is hoping that enthusiasm at Navy will soon 
rival that at Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
"After losing for so long, it's almost like it's in a dormant state here," 
Chaump said. "Even the people who have a strong feeling for the Navy, they have 
been turned off because of losing. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want to do is get the brigade excited about football. Then we'll try 
to get local interest, statewide interest, and then get Navy recognized on a 
national level. This year, we hope to get the brigade excited, and if we go any 
farther, it'll be a plus. It's going to take some time, but we plan to do it."

FINALLY, SOME GOOD NEWS AT MARYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people at the University of Maryland had grown all too accustomed to these 
mid-week afternoon news conferences. Into a room they would march, grim-faced, 
braced for bad news. Really bad news. News conference concerning Len Bias's 
death. News conference concerning Lefty Driesell's forced resignation. 
Concerning Bob Wade's forced resignation. Concerning NCAA probation and 
sanctions. Concerning Jerrod Mustaf passing up his final two years of 
eligibility. Concerning the school's appeal regarding probation. Concerning Lew 
Perkins's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
The people at Maryland had developed a Pavlovian response: There's a news 
conference, oh my God, what's wrong now? In College Park the last four years, 
the only good news was no news. Until Tuesday. Maryland called a news 
conference concerning its basketball team and people actually smiled. Nobody 
was sanctioned, suspended or forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Williams, who could have called this little meeting to announce he was 
leaving Maryland for Georgetown, UNLV or Georgia Tech, instead proclaimed he 
was staying put at Maryland for the rest of his college days. "Can you believe 
one of these gatherings with people smiling? This is the first time we've had 
good news in so long," Coach Gary Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The first reaction to his announcement in many quarters will be, Say what? 
Let's get this straight: He could have gone to Georgetown and played with 
Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo; he could have gone to Georgia Tech and 
played with Kenny Anderson; he could have gone anywhere he wanted, immediately 
played on live TV and in the NCAA tournament, but he chose to stay at Maryland? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, no one could have blamed Walt Williams if he had said, "Thanks for 
the memories, please forward my mail to McDonough Gym." 
</P>
<P>
But the decision he made apparently was in his best interests (not to mention 
Maryland's) and it may dramatically help the immediate future of Maryland 
basketball. It wasn't a decision Walt Williams required a lot of help making 
and it wasn't one he rushed. Someone asked why it took him almost all summer to 
decide and he said: "This is the biggest decision I ever had to make in my 
life, so I wanted to get it right. If I had another year, I'd take 364 more 
days. ... I really enjoy the people here. I was aware of how many credits I 
would lose and I want to keep on track for graduation in four years. ... 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started thinking this over, it wasn't hard to picture myself in 
other uniforms. But it got harder the longer the process went on. I'm an easy 
person to get along with, and I think I could have made the adjustment, but you 
still have to prove yourself to a new coach and a new team. There's a lot of 
uncertainty. It wasn't just out of loyalty that I decided to stay; first of 
all, you've got to be loyal to yourself before being loyal to anyone else. 
Maybe it does send a message that some of us feel a lot of good feelings about 
Maryland. ... But I'm not getting down on anyone who did leave this 
university." 
</P>
<P>
Williams didn't name any names, but clearly he was talking about friend and 
former teammate Mustaf, sitting a few rows away, who came to lend moral 
support. Mustaf, who made himself a first-round draft choice, appears to have 
done the right thing for him. Williams feels he made the right decision for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
How, you ask, can that be when he can never test himself in that crucible of 
the national tournament because of Maryland's NCAA-imposed two-year sanction? 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is it written that a kid can't play professional basketball -- that is 
Walt Williams's stated goal -- if he doesn't shine in the NCAA tournament. 
Robert Parish did nicely for himself. So did Jeff Malone. "Maybe for a person 
who's not going any further in basketball than the college level, the NCAA 
tournament and big TV games would be the ultimate goal," Williams reasoned this 
week. "But I have higher goals set for myself than TV and the NCAA tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, Gary Williams can be counted on to help. Without Walt 
Williams, his team would be in a mess. With him, Maryland can be reasonably 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Without exacting an out-and-out promise, Walt Williams wanted to find out 
exactly what he'd be getting for this sacrifice. "He's not going to have TV or 
the tournament," Gary Williams said. "But what he will have is the opportunity 
to play a position that will help him prepare for an NBA career. There's a 
million small forwards at 6-8; there's even a lot of off guards that size. But 
there aren't many point guards with his size and ability, and there are a lot 
of things we can do to get Walt involved." 
</P>
<P>
This is the deal: Walt Williams stays at Maryland for at least one year, maybe 
two. He will learn how to play the point position, probably very well. He will 
be The Man. Gary Williams and Walt Williams make a nice combination. Maryland 
will not be a patsy with both of them. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the scenario many people expected. They would ask Walt, when he got 
to the playground, where he was going to school. He'd say very honestly, "Don't 
know." People would ask Gary Williams, who was recruiting his head off, and he 
would say, "Don't know." 
</P>
<P>
One night last week, when Walt had made up his mind, Gary was scared to take 
the call. Well, apprehensive if not scared. It was a state of anxiety Gary 
Williams had not experienced in many, many years. "I'm usually a very, very 
positive person," he said. "Before a game against the best team in the country, 
I'm convinced when I walk on the court my team will win. But this team had been 
beaten up more (last year) than any team I've been around. I was kind of 
disappointed in myself too, because I had let that same feeling change me to 
some degree. You lose confidence that anything good can happen to you. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been hit so many times, it's tough to believe something good will 
happen. Hey, this is one of my better recruiting jobs."

LONG LIVE THE OPEN, LOUD AND UNRULY AS IT IS 
</P>

There are roughly 2,000 media types on hand in Flushing Meadow, N.Y., to cover 
the U.S. Open tennis tournament, including the guy who interviews ticket 
scalpers on the overpass from the subway platform outside and never gets to see 
the inside of the National Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later -- often after an ingrate player has complained about the 
playing conditions -- each will consider a tome on the subject of just where 
the event should be contested. 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had Martina Navratilova dispatched a young Argentine named Federica 
Haumuller Tuesday when she took off on what a nerve-racking experience it is 
playing the Open. It's a time-honored ritual of Martina's, one she should have 
scuttled long ago. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so when the wind shifts they find it necessary to run planes in and out of 
nearby LaGuardia Airport over the courts. And maybe some folks do find it 
necessary to yawn, scratch or look at their watch while a point is being 
contested. So what? 
</P>
<P>
In the world of sport there are places where certain events belong, no 
questions asked. If you ever saw a pro football game in Tiger Stadium, Detroit, 
you'd know what I'm talking about. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't to say the old home of the Lions is the only place an NFL game can 
be appreciated fully, just that it's so much more conducive to adding something 
to the contest. 
</P>
<P>
After having the opportunity to view college football games in perhaps a 
hundred different stadia, the ones that register here almost immediately are 
located on the campuses of Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Georgia and Washington. Just 
to prove size and upkeep have nothing to do with it, Dartmouth's Memorial Field 
and decrepit Harvard Stadium also are cited. 
</P>
<P>
While Fenway Park and Wrigley Field are accepted as 1 and 1A as far as baseball 
viewing goes, fact is there are a dozen minor-league parks just as good, 
perhaps better. We're talking about a facility for the enjoyment of a game 
here, not how much electronic gadgetry is present and what epicurean delights 
are available at the concession stands. 
</P>
<P>
If there's a better place to watch college hoops than the Palestra in 
Philadelphia, I've yet to experience it. And you know the game's the thing when 
you sit through a couple of doubleheaders of the Indiana State High School 
Championships in Butler University Fieldhouse and barely complain about the 
fact the benches have no backs. 
</P>
<P>
All hockey arenas should have the reputation and tradition of the Montreal 
Forum combined with the crowd of howling banshees who show up for games in 
Chicago Stadium and the chummy, cock-fight atmosphere of the Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, that's what Louis Armstrong Stadium and environs provides 
tennis, an atmosphere totally different than what Freddie Forehand and Vicki 
Volley are used to. This is bad? 
</P>
<P>
All but a few of today's practitioners are ignorant of what the U.S. Open scene 
was like before 1978. Forest Hills, barely three miles away, is a comely old 
joint where never was heard a discouraging word from the ultra-polite audience. 
</P>
<P>
It was Wimbledon all over again, only not half as good. 
</P>
<P>
A check of the accounting ledger after an ice age of play there revealed to the 
U.S. Tennis Association that not enough folks were showing up to pay the bills. 
The country club set be hanged, let's try to popularize this sport they 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the year, the tennis pros travel around playing quiet little 
matches, protected by a chair umpire who is constantly cautioning the audience 
that hitting a backhand requires as much quiet and concentration as entry into 
the skull for brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
And after a while, players, who can practice four to a court side-by-side as 
far as the eye can see, actually begin believing that even the slightest sound 
or movement is at least as big a crises as the Persian Gulf situation. 
</P>
<P>
A flashbulb going off, a scream or sudden movement can be distracting. But 
distractions are there in every sport. Imagine a pitcher, in the ninth inning 
of a World Series game with the score tied, complaining because there's 
movement in the stands. Or John Unitas demanding perfect silence as he prepared 
to march the Baltimore Colts into the record books in that epic Yankee Stadium 
struggle years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This is the U.S. Open, loud, raucous and ridiculous. In other words, the way we 
like our sports. We want our champions thick-skinned, able to handle adversity 
and quick enough to avoid an obscenity or foreign object thrown from the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Stan Smith trooped into town to conduct a clinic and it was 
just after the United States had beaten Romania in a memorable Davis Cup 
confrontation in Bucharest. It was out-and-out war through the first four 
matches and the teams were square, 2-2, heading to the last match, Smith vs. 
Ion Tiriac. 
</P>
<P>
Stan moaned and groaned about the treatment, how he and his teammates feared 
for their lives as Tiriac, playing out of his gourd, evened the match forcing a 
fifth and deciding set. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, they came out and laid a layer of sand over the clay slowing 
the surface down even more," big-hitter Smith said. He was alive now and out of 
his chair describing the final set, which he won, 6-0. It was suggested the 
experience would always be one of the highlights of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, you're right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Would that they transfer the Masters out of Augusta? Long live the bellicose 
Open in its unruly, seamy home hard by that vision of awfulness Shea Stadium. 
Nearly a half million spectators (last year's attendance) can't be wrong, even 
if they are New Yorkers.

GRAF AND CAPRIATI WIN TO SET UP OPEN SHOWDOWN IN FOURTH ROUND

The first big women's singles showdown in the U.S. Open took shape Saturday 
when Steffi Graf and Jennifer Capriati won their matches to set up a 
fourth-round encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Graf actually dropped a set to No. 121-ranked Elna Reinach but won, 6-4, 3-6, 
6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Strange thing is, I felt better after losing the (second) set than winning the 
first," Graf said. "Just getting into the (third) set, I felt better, I don't 
know why." 
</P>
<P>
Graf said she got into trouble because she felt out of rhythm, but Capriati 
marched smartly into her meeting with the top-ranked Graf. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, seeded 13th, defeated Maria Strandlund, 6-1, 6-4, to set up a rematch 
of her fourth-round match against Graf at Wimbledon, their only other meeting 
in a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that I'm going to have to attack more and come to the net and be ready 
for the drop shot," Capriati said. "Also, I'll have to return serve better and 
just hang in there with her." 
</P>
<P>
Zina Garrison, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Katerina Maleeva and Jana Novotna won 
their matches. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison defeated Silke Meier, 6-4, 6-3; Maleeva defeated Rafaella Reggi, 6-4, 
6-0 and will take on Novotna, a 6-3, 6-1 winner over Laura Gildemeister. THOMAS

Michael Andretti came back in the final moments of qualifying to bump Danny 
Sullivan out of the pole position for today's Indy car race at Vancouver, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Andretti's fast lap of 98.540 m.p.h. came with less than three minutes

BAYAKOA SCORES EXPECTED VICTORY, BUT IT TAKES HER UNTIL FINAL JUMP

Even though he felt positive about the outcome, Frank Whitham wasted no time 
making his way down to the track after Saturday's $156,000 Chula Vista 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought she'd gotten beat, but I wanted to see how the mare was," said 
Bayakoa's owner. 
</P>
<P>
Whitham would have felt better had he talked with Chris McCarron, who was 
aboard Fantastic Look. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Laffit (Pincay on Bayakoa) I thought he got me in the last jump," said 
McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
The rider was right. Seemingly beaten with less than 50 yards to go, Bayakoa 
found something extra and beat Fantastic Look by a nose in 1:40 3/5 for the 1 
1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Spotting the runner-up 14 pounds (127-113), the 2-5 favorite looked as if she 
were headed to her second straight defeat over this track and consecutive 
losses in the Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Fantastic Look, who gave her a scare in Hollywood Park's Milady June 16, looked 
as if she had the upset this time. "I thought I was drawing away from her," 
McCarron said. "I got a neck, then a half-length in front of her. But, she just 
kept fighting, fighting, fighting and won the battle." 
</P>
<P>
This was the 19th victory in 34 tries for Bayakoa, and her latest triumph 
pushed her earnings to more than $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a tough one," trainer Ron McAnally said. "I don't think she's ever 
had to run harder than that. That was an awful lot of weight to give away. It's 
a lot to ask; even a horse like her. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Chris knew my mare and would be doing everything he could to pull this 
off. He rode a great race. But, even when Fantastic Look went ahead in the 
stretch, I thought our mare would come back and get her." 
</P>
<P>
For Pincay, it was a welcome victory. It was his first stakes victory of the 
meeting. He had lost another for McAnally when Tight Spot was disqualified in a 
controversial decision in the Del Mar Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"She came back, and she's never done that before," he said. "I just held her 
together. I didn't want to throw the reins away. I was where I wanted to be on 
the backstretch, but she jumped a piece of paper, lost her stride for a few 
seconds, then picked it up again. 
</P>
<P>
"She was coming back in the stretch and kept trying. I thought I'd won it, but 
I've been wrong before." 
</P>
<P>
Ahead of Bayakoa early when second in the Milady, Fantastic Look was content to 
lay just off the winner through 23 flat and 46 2/5 fractions, then moved up on 
the inside to get a head advantage after they had run six furlongs in 1:10. 
</P>
<P>
"She sure ran her eyeballs out," McCarron said of the runner-up, the 7-2 second 
choice. "She's one of the most honest horses I've ever ridden. Before (trainer) 
Gary (Jones) left for Chicago (he's running Classic Fame in today's Arlington 
Million) he just said to put pressure on (Bayakoa) all the way. He said maybe 
the weight would take its toll. It almost did. My filly was just second best 
today." 
</P>
<P>
The other three Chula Vista starters were non-factors. Formidable Lady, who is 
also trained by Jones, was third, 4 1/2 lengths behind Fantastic Look and 
nearly two lengths ahead of Rosadora. Estrella Fuega was last in a field 
reduced by the late scratches of Patches and Seville. 
</P>
<P>
If history means anything, Title Bought will win the $290,400 Del Mar Debutante 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old Lyphard's Wish filly is trained by Wayne Lukas and he has owned 
this race. 
</P>
<P>
When Rue de Palm scored a $40.80 surprise in last year's Debutante, it was 
Lukas' third straight win in the event and seventh in eight years. The only 
year he missed was when Brave Raj won in 1986 for Mel Stute. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Clover Racing Stable, Title Bought backed up in her first two starts, 
but then was very impressive when she stretched out and won going a mile, the 
Debutante distance. 
</P>
<P>
Another Debutante entrant with a win at the distance is Gold Fleece. Dispatched 
at 20-1 after finishing sixth in her sprint debut, the Deputed Testamony filly 
upset maidens, prompting trainer John Sadler to take a shot in the Debutante. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought all along she wanted to run a distance," said Sadler, who is having 
a solid season at Del Mar. He's tied for fourth in the standings with eight 
victories and he's been in the money with 27 of his 62 starters. "You're 
running for $200,000 in what is really a conditioned race. I know she'll get 
the trip." 
</P>
<P>
Lite Light, who won the seven-furlong Sorrento Stakes by 4 1/2 lengths as a 
17-1 shot, is the probable favorite. She's come back to work well for Henry 
Moreno and will be trying to present owner Jack Finley with his second 
Debutante success. He won with Raja's Delight in 1980 and was second with 
Doon's Baby four years later. 
</P>
<P>
The other entrants are Beyond Perfection, who was second in the Sorrento as the 
6-5 choice, recent maiden winners Nice Assay and Brazen and Alyfair, who will 
be putting on blinkers for trainer Richard Mandella. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Arlington Million will be simulcast locally between the first and second 
races. Approximate post time is 2:40 p.m. PDT. . . . Skip Out Front, an 
8-year-old son of Bynoderm whose biggest victory came in the 1988 American 
Handicap, has been retired to stud. Also second in last year's Eddie Read 
Handicap and third in the 1987 Read and Del Mar Handicaps, Skip Out Front 
retires with 15 wins, 10 seconds, 13 thirds and earnings of $871,996 from 70 
starts. . . . Wayne Lukas turns 55 today. . . . Brazen and Beyond Perfection 
were supplemented to the Futurity for $10,000 and all starters in the race will 
carry 114 pounds with the exception of Lite Light who was assigned 120. 
</P>
<P>
Leading rider Pat Valenzuela won three times with Snow Perch, On A Roll and 
first-time starter Classic Setting to move 13 ahead of Kent Desormeaux in the 
jockey standings. David Flores won a pair with Akrotiri and Island Choice.

MCGEE COULD STILL WIN NATIONAL LEAGUE BATTING TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTY NOBLE, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Athletics' acquisition of Willie McGee late Wednesday night did more than 
bolster their championship chances. It also created several intriguing 
possibilities for him and his new team. 
</P>
<P>
Although he's left the National League, McGee conceivably could emerge as its 
batting champion. Because statistics do not officially transfer from one league 
to the other, he is "in the clubhouse" with a .335 average, which ranked second 
in the National League to Lenny Dykstra's .340 average before Thursday night's 
games. No player ever has won a batting title while competing in the other 
league. Rick Honeycutt, however, did lead the American League in earned run 
average in 1983 after pitching for the Dodgers the final six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Harry "The Hat" Walker led the National League in batting in 1947 with a .363 
average, batting .200 in 10 games with the Cardinals before a May 3 trade, then 
batting .371 in 130 games with the Phillies. Dale Alexander, playing with the 
Red Sox and Tigers in 1932, led the American League in batting at .367. And Gus 
Zernial led the AL in home runs and RBI in 1951 while splitting the season 
between the White Sox and Athletics. But McGee has changed leagues, and 
therefore, he can accomplish an unprecedented feat. All he needs to do is watch 
Dykstra's average fall. 
</P>
<P>
Dykstra, batting .418 through June 3, batted .293 in 294 subsequent at-bats 
before Thursday night. More significant, perhaps, is that he had batted .308 in 
182 at-bats since the All-Star break. If he were to continue to hit safely at 
that rate in the Phillies' remaining 35 games and averaged 3.71 at-bats, as he 
had through Wednesday, he would finish with 200 hits in 601 at-bats, a .333 
average and runner-up status. 
</P>
<P>
And that doesn't even take Dave Magadan into consideration. The Mets' first 
baseman was batting .333 in 345 at-bats before Thursday night. If he won, he 
would be the Mets' first batting champion. 
</P>
<P>
Magadan, who entered the batting race as the No. 4 batter in the league Aug. 8 
when his total plate appearances finally qualified, considers McGee and Dykstra 
quite formidable competition, and not only because of their averages. 
</P>
<P>
"Lenny and McGee play on (artificial) turf, and (Tony) Gwynn might as well 
(because) the infield is so hard in San Diego," he said. "And they can get some 
leg hits. I'm not going to get many of those. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can stay close as long as I don't get unlucky," Magadan said. "I've 
already passed that period of being mentally tired. So if I stay away from bad 
luck, I'm OK. With me, the hits have to be perfect because I'm not going to 
beat out a ball in the hole. Some of the worst slumps -- if you want to call 
them that -- I've ever had are the times when I've hit the ball hard." 
</P>
<P>
If McGee wins the batting championship, it will be his second. He also won in 
1985, the season he batted a career-high .353 and won the National League Most 
Valuable Player Award. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens in the race, McGee has assured himself of avoiding two 
unwanted distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, McGee and Norm Cash, the late Tigers slugger, were the only players 
in major-league history to bat .350 or higher in a season of at least 450 
at-bats without hitting higher than .300 in any other "full" season. Now Cash 
stands alone. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, McGee's error total for the National League will remain at 16. He 
almost certainly will lead National League outfielders in errors -- Lonnie 
Smith of the Braves is second with 11 -- but McGee's total is far from the 20 
"Indian Bob" Johnson committed with the Athletics in 1935. Whatever errors 
McGee commits with the A's won't be added to the 16. 
</P>
<P>
But think of the possibilities: McGee not only could be the National League 
batting champion, playing for the American League champions in the World 
Series, but he and Rickey Henderson could emerge as batting champions and 
teammates. That would be a more immediate marriage than what developed last 
winter when free-agent Mark Davis, the 1989 National League Cy Young Award 
winner, signed with the Royals and joined his American League counterpart, Bret 
Saberhagen. 
</P>
<P>
Looked good at the time, but look at what has happened to the Royals since.

Ron Jacobs strolled into a Long Beach restaurant -- tan, fit and looking a 
decade younger than his 47 years. 
</P>
<P>
When last seen in the South Bay 10 years ago, Jacobs had been dismissed as 
Loyola Marymount's basketball coach after leading the team to its first NCAA 
Tournament appearance in 19 years. He was suing the school. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides settled out of court in September, 1980. The basketball program 
continued under Ed Goorjian, Jacobs' top assistant, while a haggard-looking and 
admittedly bitter Jacobs retreated into the background to become -- in his 
words -- "a basketball recluse." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs bounced halfway around the world, and a few years later discovered he 
was sitting on top of it again. 
</P>
<P>
Now Jacobs says the string of events that started with his firing at Loyola 
"was the best thing that ever happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs coached the Philippine National Team to unprecedented success and became 
a favorite of the man who hired him, Eduardo Cojuangco. When the Ferdinand 
Marcos regime fell in 1986 -- effectively ending Jacobs' coaching career there 
-- he remained a confidant to Cojuangco, a Marcos protege who is considered by 
some political observers as the favorite to become the country's next president 
when elections are held in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"The job I ended up with in the Philippines was the greatest job in the world," 
Jacobs said. "We had the enthusiasm of college with the financial backing of an 
NBA team. (Cojuangco) took me from nothing to where my self-esteem was back." 
Six months after leaving Loyola in the summer of 1980, Jacobs got a call from 
the Basketball Assn. of the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The organization had been scouting Pepperdine standout Ricardo Brown, whose 
mother and grandmother had Philippine roots. While looking at game films of 
Brown playing against Loyola, the Filipinos became interested in the Loyola 
style of play. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked Ricardo and (then Pepperdine Coach Jim) Harrick about me," Jacobs 
said. "Harrick says, 'This is your guy to coach the team. He doesn't have a job 
right now.' Ricardo also said some good things about me and that's how they got 
my number. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Philippine representative) asked if I would be interested in coaching the 
national team of the Philippines. I said I didn't think so but I would be happy 
to meet with them and listen to them." 
</P>
<P>
The representative explained that basketball is the national sport in the 
Philippines, and the organization hoped to improve the national team's world 
standing by signing American players with Philippine heritage -- inspired by 
the 1976 Puerto Rican Olympic team's performance featuring Marquette standout 
Butch Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs at first indicated that he was not interested. "I thought, 'Why do I 
want to go halfway around the world? They've got some problems there.' I said I 
wasn't interested in coaching, but I would help them. It gave me 
</P>
<P>
something to do with basketball." Jacobs helped the organization scout players 
and made coaching suggestions, including former Harbor College Coach Jim White 
and University of San Francisco Coach Dan Belluomini, who turned down the 
Filipinos. Jacobs continued to resist the organization's coaching offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's about Christmas," Jacobs said. "(The salary offer) is getting up 
there. I said, 'It's getting interesting.' I tell them I'll go to the 
Philippines to meet, figuring it's just for a visit." 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Manila, Jacobs said he remembered thinking, "I'm going to 
enjoy this trip like a vacation, but there's no way I'm coming back to this 
place." 
</P>
<P>
The next day he met with Cojuangco, one of the wealthiest men in the 
Philippines, who was in charge of developing a world-class basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Cojuangco told Jacobs: "This is what I want done. I want to go to the Olympics. 
I want the best possible team. I want American players who are eligible. . . . 
Can it be done? How much money is it going to cost?" 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said: "So I'm thinking about Loyola, our budget was about $20,000 or 
$30,000. He asked me, 'Would a million dollars do it?' and I said, 'Uh, I 
believe so.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, who had always coached within a 20-mile radius of his Seal Beach home, 
was suddenly back in basketball, half a world away. 
</P>
<P>
He built the team initially with six Americans -- including two Loyola players, 
Jeff Moore and Robert Worthy -- and 12 Filipinos, while Cojuangco built the 
training facilities that Jacobs requested. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs' new team defeated the country's two top professional teams, but 
outraged the public because his team's top players were Americans. "We 
demolished them," Jacobs said. "It's like a national scandal." 
</P>
<P>
The public and media might have been incensed, but Cojuangco was pleased. He 
had Jacobs sign six more American players. Jacobs took the team to the Jones 
Cup in Taiwan and won the title, beating the U.S. in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're good," Jacobs said. "We're too good." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before the Asian Games, it was decided by Basketball Assn. of the 
Philippines to drop the American players and put together an all-Filipino team. 
It still managed to place fourth, and followed that performance by winning the 
Southeast Asian Games in Manila. 
</P>
<P>
"It's 1981," Jacobs said. "I came home. I think this thing is over." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he was asked to develop some young Filipino players for the Youth 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
"All we did was take some college kids and worked with them for nine straight 
months," he said. "We trained them like we train here. We did everything first 
class." 
</P>
<P>
The underdog team beat rival Korea and defeated China for the championship. 
"From then, I'm a national hero," Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
Cojuangco told Jacobs: "You're no longer an employee. You're family." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs was allowed to add two Americans under international rules, and he 
selected Moore and 6-foot-9 Loyola recruit Dennis Still. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept the nucleus of that team, add Still and Moore. And soon these 
Filipinos were pretty good. With Jeff and Dennis, we're better than anybody (in 
Asia)." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs kept the core of that team for four years. The climax came in 1985 at 
the World Club championship in Barcelona, where the Philippines defeated Italy 
by 19 points and lost by five to an American team led by current NBA stars 
David Robinson and Chuck Person. 
</P>
<P>
It followed that performance by flying 23 hours to Asia to compete in the Jones 
Cup. With barely a breather, the team played in Taiwan the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired," Jacobs said. "We're jet-lagged. It's so hot we can hardly 
breathe. We destroy England." 
</P>
<P>
It also beat Korea, West Germany and Uruguay to go undefeated in its bracket. 
The team played the U.S., also undefeated, for the title. Using proficient 
three-point shooting, Jacobs' team upset the U.S. in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we were in good shape when the U.S. hit their first six shots in 
overtime -- and we were still ahead," Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
The game was televised in Manila, and Jacobs and the team returned home as the 
toast of the Philippines. They were honored by Marcos. Parades were proposed. 
The team won a few more games against Philippine pro teams and won the 
Southeast Asian games again. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1986, with elections forthcoming, Corazon Aquino was mounting a 
popular challenge to Marcos. Jacobs' Manila home was close enough for him to 
touch demonstrators. Aquino's followers ousted Marcos after the February 
elections, and Jacobs' mentor, Cojuangco, left the country with Marcos. Jacobs' 
coaching career was abruptly ended, but he stayed in Manila to watch the 
fascinating developments. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived in the middle of where the revolution was going on," he said. "I tell 
people in one month I got a master's (degree) in political science." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said he turned down a number of jobs to return to the U.S. and help 
Cojuangco, who just recently returned to Manila. 
</P>
<P>
For the past four years Jacobs said he has "basically rolled the dice with this 
guy . . . (living) more a political environment than a basketball environment." 
</P>
<P>
Currently Jacobs is living in Seal Beach and is living off investments. 
</P>
<P>
After winning a CIF title at Morningside High and five successful seasons as 
coach at El Camino College, the ambitious Jacobs saw a golden opportunity on 
the four-year college level at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
The university, encouraged to re-emphasize athletics and basketball by an 
alumni survey in 1979, relieved Coach Dave Benaderet of his duties after a 5-21 
season. A university committee narrowed the list of candidates for the coaching 
job to four finalists. In March, 1979, it selected Bill Mulligan, the 
successful veteran coach at Saddleback Community College. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, with second thoughts about uprooting his family from Orange 
County, Mulligan announced he was staying at Saddleback. Mulligan eventually 
became coach at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, who had finished second among the finalists, was contacted in early 
April and accepted the job. 
</P>
<P>
"He was young, ambitious and enthusiastic and had been successful," said Dick 
Baker, who was then the school's athletic director. "He had that aura of 
success about him. . . he was the kind of guy that would spend the hours and 
energy necessary to get it done. At that time at Loyola, you had to be a hard 
worker." 
</P>
<P>
Taking over the program late in the recruiting season, Jacobs built the nucleus 
of the team from the players he had coached at El Camino. The talented Moore 
was joined by El Camino teammates Michael Antoine and Danny Davis. That 
threesome, blended with shooter Jim McCloskey -- who had transferred from USC a 
year earlier -- provided the Lions a quick-fix lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs led Loyola to second place in the West Coast Athletic Conference with a 
10-6 league record. It finished 14-13 overall. With conference champion San 
Francisco on probation, making it ineligible for postseason play, the Lions 
were given the conference's automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament. They were 
the 48th and final-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions lost to West Regional host Arizona State, 99-71, but none of the 
new-found euphoria was lost by the happy university administration and alumni. 
With most of his players scheduled to return, the future looked bright for 
Jacobs and the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
But trouble began brewing in mid-March when Baker resigned as athletic 
director. Jacobs, the new Loyola hero, began flexing his muscle and pushing the 
university administration for a new contract and consideration for the athletic 
directorship. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs soon was at odds with Dr. Henry Durand, vice president of student 
affairs, who oversaw athletics. Durand, who preferred a different candidate for 
the athletic director's job, discovered a discrepancy in a player's transcript. 
Durand reported it to the conference and held Jacobs responsible. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the university hired Robert Arias, a USC administrator, as 
athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs denied any involvement with the transcript problem -- which involved the 
eligibility of a reserve who didn't figure in Jacobs' plans -- but he was asked 
to resign by the school president, Father Donald Merrifield. Jacobs refused and 
a few weeks later, Merrifield delivered a letter to Jacobs informing him that 
he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Jacobs "may have pushed too hard. If I had stayed there, things 
would have been fine. He pushed for a little more and a little more. Then he 
decided he wanted to be athletic director as well, and I don't think they 
wanted that. Ron pushed too hard. I think he's more mature now. He would know 
when to stop now. He didn't then." 
</P>
<P>
But Jacobs didn't want a cheating stigma on his reputation and sued the school. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the parties settled out of court later that summer, Jacobs remained 
bitter for years. He remained close to Baker, White and former assistant Paul 
Howard and quietly attended a few Loyola games the next season. 
</P>
<P>
Arias was athletic director until 1985 and Durand remained in his position 
until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs' feelings have softened in recent years. "I was bitter till the day 
Durand left," he said. "The guys who got me were gone." 
</P>
<P>
When Jacobs left, several of his key players left as well. For years, his 
successor, Ed Goorjian, felt Jacobs undermined the program. Jacobs said he 
advised the players to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
White said: "I was privy to a couple of those conversations. I know for a fact 
they were told by Ron to stay. I also know they weren't very good students and 
they hooked up to his star ship. It goes both ways -- when you're fiercely 
loyal to your players, they're fiercely loyal to you." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Jacobs said he doesn't regret taking the Loyola job. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never change my mind, Loyola was a great experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a coaching job in Jacobs' future? 
</P>
<P>
From the time he left Loyola, Jacobs felt his college coaching career was over, 
and that there was a smear he would never be able to remove. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's feasible," Jacobs said. "I've been out of the States 10 
years. With that stigma I have, someone would have to be willing to go to bat 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
The irony, Jacobs said, is "I'm a hundred times better coach and I can handle 
different situations so much better." 
</P>
<P>
White, who helped Jacobs scout tournaments abroad, agreed. "He's a very 
detail-conscious guy," he said. "He has a tremendous ability to relate to his 
players on and off the floor. And he wins." 
</P>
<P>
Baker thinks Jacobs should be given a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
"If a program took a serious look at him, they'd see this guy has some 
qualities and could help," Baker said. "That's perhaps a long shot. But it 
could conceivably happen. His best chance, though, would be to go with someone 
else's program as an assistant. But he probably wouldn't want to do that at 
this stage because it would be difficult for him."

ERMA BOMBECK: FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL IS A BUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK, Erma Bombeck is on vacation. She left a few of her favorite 
columns behind. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first day of school is rough on mothers -- especially the young ones who 
are saying goodby to an era. I dropped in on Jean Carp to hold her hand and 
reassure her that everyone would survive the day. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you get Kenny off to school?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, finally," she groaned, pouring herself a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened?" 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't want to go." 
</P>
<P>
"You're kidding." 
</P>
<P>
"No, he said the kids wouldn't like him." 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't you tell him how ridiculous that was?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I told him how during the summer he had made a lot of friends. Then he 
said his teachers had it in for him." 
</P>
<P>
"Why would he say a thing like that when he doesn't even know them yet?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. I almost got him out of the door when he came back and changed 
his clothes for the third time. Said his belt was too wide and his shoes too 
clean." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, good grief." 
</P>
<P>
"That's when he slumped down into a chair and said, 'I'll never find the 
restroom or the cafeteria. I'm surely not going to ask someone.' " 
</P>
<P>
"What did you tell him?" 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I'd put a note in his pocket with B-O-Y-S printed on it and pack 
his lunch." 
</P>
<P>
"Did that do it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nope. He wanted to know how many days he had to put in until Christmas 
vacation." 
</P>
<P>
"What an attitude," I said, shaking my head. 
</P>
<P>
"He got out to the driveway. Then he came back in again and said, 'Why do I 
have to go to school anyway? Why can't I just stay home and help you? I could 
run errands and take out the garbage and watch the baby for you when you go to 
the dentist.' Can you believe he actually offered to get a regular job?" 
</P>
<P>
"Incredible." 
</P>
<P>
"I really felt sorry for him, though," said Jean. "When I watched him walk down 
the street clutching his lunch bag and hanging onto those pitiful few books and 
a new pencil, I wanted to call him back. But when a man is 44 years old and the 
new principal, he has no choice." 
</P>
<P>
I shook my head. "Don't be surprised if he bolts at lunch."

Even if the weather had been hot and muggy, they would have turned out in their 
favorite Adolfos, wool or otherwise, to pay tribute to Adolfo at the CHIPS 
(Collegiate Helpers in Philanthropic Service) fashion show and luncheon last 
week at Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
When the show was delayed because the models had been given the wrong call 
time, chairwoman Jenny Jones Rutt exercised her executive prerogative and 
announced that lunch would be served first. "It reminds me of Girl Scouts," 
Rutt said. "You're ready to go to a movie and it rains." 
</P>
<P>
Harriet Deutsch was in a blue-and-white checked Adolfo, Barbara Davis in a 
white one. Guests, anticipating the fall social season, were taking notes, 
making choices. 
</P>
<P>
CHIPS President Marcia Hobbs was up front. Marion Jorgensen was at the center 
of a troop of pals: Betty Wilson (Marcia Hobbs' mother and the wife of former 
Vatican Ambassador William Wilson), Betty Adams, Virginia Milner, Chardee 
Trainer and former U.S. Chief of Protocol Lee Annenberg. Opposite were Jenny 
Rutt's mother, Mary Jones Marshall; Arletta Tronstein, and Barbara Bakewell and 
Dagmar Hegland, who drove down from Montecito. 
</P>
<P>
Style aficionados Joni Smith, Helene Irvin, Patty Burschinger, Annabelle 
Heiferman and Kelly Gilmore all liked Adolfo's longer jackets and metallic 
glitter, and Irvin stepped backstage later to tell Adolfo so. 
</P>
<P>
IN STYLE: Elsewhere, typical of the fall scene, fashion luncheons are bunching 
up by the dozens. Friends of the Julia Ann Singer Center will show off Michael 
Novarese's fashions Sept. 13 at their 27th annual benefit luncheon in the 
International Ballroom of the Beverly Hilton. They will raise funds for abused, 
emotionally disturbed children. The Auxiliary of Hathaway Children's Services 
will host an afternoon tea and showing of Diane Freis' fall collection Sept. 19 
at Hotel Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
CROWDS: September presents a crunch. Wolfgang Puck and Vincent Price will 
combine chefs and winemakers for the American Wine &amp; Food Festival Sept. 
15, with 1,000 expected to attend the Western set cookout at Universal Studios. 
Organized by the Wolfgang Puck Charitable Foundation and sponsored by Martell 
Cognac, its goal is to raise $350,000 for Los Angeles Meals on Wheels. 
</P>
<P>
In a benefit for the Sojourn Shelter for Battered Women and Their Children, 
honorary dinner chairs Jane Fonda, Mariette Hartley, George Wendt, Joyce Van 
Patten, Allyce Beasly and Larry Carlton will pitch in for a foot-stompin' 
"Sojourn at the French Quarter" dinner at Orleans Restaurant Sept. 22. Kudos 
will go to a trio for their interest in child abuse: Lucille Roybal-Allard, 
Shirley Fredricks and Sandra L. Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
STELLAR: How to top the closing of USC's $641.5-million fund-raiser, the 
largest campaign (launched in 1986) in the institution's history? With the "A 
Magic of Giving" gala Sept. 12 at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Many 
multimillion-dollar donors will be among the 800 guests. 
</P>
<P>
ELLIS ISLAND: Angelenos will be at the Saturday reopening of Ellis Island in 
New York Harbor. Suzanne Marx, David and Gloria Wolper, Lady Dodge and Tina 
Backenbush plan to preview the Ellis Island Immigration Museum and attend a 
black-tie dinner-dance, as well as the midday dedication next Sunday. A 
highlight will be Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation Chairman Lee 
Iacocca's private reception and brunch for dignitaries. President and Mrs. Bush 
are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
SLEEKED UP: A chance to window shop at Gumps and adopt a pet is the idea behind 
the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Champagne 
reception Wednesday. Gumps' new executive director, Kirk B. Gerou, and Penelope 
J. von Kalinowski have corralled celebrities and animal lovers for the event. 
They will also announce Paloma Award honorees. 
</P>
<P>
Steeds are being groomed for the 33rd Portuguese Bend National Horse Show at 
the Empty Saddle Club in Rolling Hills Estates, a benefit for Childrens 
Hospital of Los Angeles. Competitors will perform in equestrian events Friday, 
Saturday and next Sunday. The show features the prestigious Pacific Coast 
Horsemanship Assn. Medal finals and more than 70 hunter, jumper and junior 
classes. By event's end, the committee headed by Carole Diestel and show chair 
Jody Murdock expect members of the sponsoring Peninsula Committee of the 
Childrens Hospital will have logged 14,000 volunteer hours. 
</P>
<P>
BRAVO: Susi McConaghy, president, and Shirley Goldsmith, benefit chairwoman of 
the Pasadena Junior Philharmonic Committee's Pasadena Showcase House, gathered 
friends to announce a $250,000 donation to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, 
bringing their total contribution over the years to $3.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
WELCOME: Bill and Eileen Zimmerman invited friends to meet Uwe Christiansen, 
the new director of the Huntington Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena. He's purchased a 
home with a pretty flower garden.

SCHOOL IN TROUBLE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IS LOW AT GAGE JUNIOR HIGH IN HUNTINGTON PARK. 
THE PRINCIPAL, TEACHERS AND PARENTS ARGUE FIERCELY ABOUT WHAT TO DO.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone agrees that improvements are needed at Gage Junior High School, where 
students have consistently scored below the national average on tests of 
reading, writing and mathematics. But agreeing on a solution is a different 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
The poor achievement record has triggered a heated battle among the principal, 
teachers and rival parents groups over what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
One group of parents and City Councilman Luis Hernandez have called for the 
ouster of David R. Almada, who has been principal at Gage since September, 
1988. They are backed by key members of the teaching staff who say they have 
lost confidence in Almada's ability to improve the school. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for leadership," said Sergio Palos, president of Community in 
Action, which collected about 200 signatures from parents and other residents 
calling for Almada to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"They're creating a whole generation of second-class citizens who can only hope 
to hold jobs at McDonald's," Palos said. 
</P>
<P>
But another parents group says that instead of the principal, five of the 
teachers should be fired to restore harmony to the school and its 3,200 
students. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Horacio Quinones, an East Los Angeles education activist and a member 
of the Hispanic Parent Coalition, made up of more than 1,000 parents, has 
accused the Anglo teachers of rebelling against the Latino principal, creating 
havoc at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Almada) had had the support and help of his staff, there wouldn't have 
been any difficulty," Quinones said. "But they started cutting him down as soon 
as he got there because he is Hispanic." 
</P>
<P>
The teachers denied that allegation and filed a defamation lawsuit against 
Quinones on Aug. 24 in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute reached such proportions that Los Angeles school Supt. William R. 
Anton recently met with Almada and the teachers and urged them to work out 
their differences. Anton also assigned four specialists to the school to help 
improve its educational program. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't stand there and let the school fall apart instructionally," Deputy 
Supt. Sidney A. Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict at Gage has been brewing for months. It came to a head in recent 
weeks during a series of meetings organized by Palos to inform parents about 
how the school could be improved. Almada, 45, and several teachers spoke at the 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Palos and other parents in his group soon decided that Almada was the problem. 
They reached that conclusion after a meeting July 26 in which teachers Rhonda 
B. Nalisnik and Edward J. Zschoche described a disorganized school where 
teacher morale was low and students were not receiving the instruction they 
need to succeed, Palos said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the questions came up (about) who was responsible to make the decisions, 
the conclusion was that the principal was," Zschoche said in an interview. "We 
can come up with all the ideas in the world, and unless we're permitted to 
implement those ideas, nothing happens." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Nalisnik and Zschoche, teachers William T. Higbee, Paul Shapiro 
and John A. Duhaime have been targeted by Quinones' group. 
</P>
<P>
The five teachers are all Gage veterans who have served on school committees 
over the years. In addition, Nalisnik is a mentor teacher, and Zschoche and 
Higbee are union representatives at the school. Palos calls the five teachers 
some of the best at Gage. 
</P>
<P>
Palos' group and the teachers have the backing of Councilman Hernandez, who has 
been involved with school affairs as an alternate member of Gage's Shared 
Decision Making Council, a body of community and school personnel that decides 
school policy in various areas. Palos is a full member of the council. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents have come to a decision," Hernandez said. "They see what they call 
a lack of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
But Almada said that academic achievement has been low at Gage for years and 
that it is unrealistic to expect him to turn things around in the two years he 
has been principal. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had teachers and parents saying we need more academic programs, and we're 
moving ahead," said Almada, who noted that he has added several algebra 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
But Palos said his group's resolve to remove Almada was strengthened by a 
recent school review performed by Los Angeles Unified School District personnel 
for the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The review team found that some Spanish-speaking children at Gage were not 
receiving adequate instruction in English. It also found that record-keeping 
for students in the school's bilingual program was poor and that some parents 
were not being notified that their children had been placed in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Almada said he is working to correct the deficiencies, which he blamed 
partially on budget constraints. He also noted the school's high transiency 
rate: About 20% of the students come and go each year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so many kids coming in that it is difficult," Almada said. 
</P>
<P>
The reviewers also found deficiencies in the school's math program and in its 
English classes for students who speak little English. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most striking findings concerned relations between the 
administration and the teachers at Gage. 
</P>
<P>
The review team said it "found that a lack of cooperation and communication 
adversely affected the quality of . . . the (educational) product itself." 
</P>
<P>
The team urged the staff to resolve its conflicts, saying: "All students at 
Gage Junior High School deserve a collegial, professional learning environment 
and instructional program." 
</P>
<P>
Almada said he will work to improve relations with his staff. He declined to 
comment on the actions of the teachers who oppose him. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the teachers alienated some parents at the same July 26 meeting 
where they won over Palos' group. 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, Nalisnik spoke forcefully about the school's problems: 
</P>
<P>
Academic achievement is low. Since 1986, Gage students have scored below the 
40th percentile on the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, a nationally 
standardized test of reading, writing and mathematics. That means 60% of 
students nationwide scored better than Gage students. 
</P>
<P>
District records show that Gage students also consistently scored below the 
district and statewide averages on a similar state test, the California 
Assessment Program. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Nalisnik urged parents to press for change at the school. 
"Otherwise," she said, "you may as well simply take out your matches and burn 
the school down." Then she lighted a match. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Quinones and about 40 other parents and students demonstrated in 
front of Gage calling for the ouster of the five teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators carried signs that said, "Don't burn our school" and "Let's 
clean our school of useless teachers." They chanted: "We don't want Miss 
Nalisnik." 
</P>
<P>
"(Nalisnik) incited to riot," Quinones said. "She took a book of matches, and 
lighted it and said this is the way you do it. We do not want that kind of 
teacher to be a model to our children." 
</P>
<P>
Nalisnik declined to comment, but Zschoche said the veteran teacher was not 
urging parents to burn the school. 
</P>
<P>
Nalisnik's statement was metaphorical, Zschoche said. "Then she took out a 
single match and lit it. Rhonda was our drama teacher, and she has a flair for 
the dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
But Ernestine Mansour, a member of Gage's Shared Decision Making Council who 
was at the demonstration alongside Quinones, said the teachers have not acted 
in the best interests of the students and should be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Mansour, a volunteer and part-time employee at Gage whose daughter attends the 
school, said that Gage has its problems but that Almada has done what he could. 
</P>
<P>
"(Almada) could do better if everybody cooperates," Mansour said. "They haven't 
taken into consideration what he's done in two years. It's quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Quinones said the low achievement at Gage is typical of what is happening 
throughout the district at inner-city schools with large numbers of minority 
students and few minority teachers. Only 19 of Gage's 145 teachers are Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to a 1989 district report titled "The Children Can No Longer Wait," 
which acknowledged that institutional racism prevented minority youngsters from 
receiving the same quality of education as Anglo students. 
</P>
<P>
Quinones accused the five teachers of racist acts against students. He declined 
to give details, saying he feared retaliation against the alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
But Quinones did allege that Shapiro called students "dumb Mexicans" when they 
joined the recent demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro denied that he made a derogatory remark to the student demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers' lawyer, Lawrence Trygstad, denied that his clients have 
mistreated Latino pupils or contributed to the school's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers are just concerned with the education of the students," said 
Trygstad, who works for the United Teachers of Los Angeles. "They feel (Almada) 
is not really being an educational leader." 
</P>
<P>
Two district officials interviewed children, teachers and parents but found no 
evidence of racism at the campus, Region Supt. Maria Casillas said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent efforts and wishes of district officials, there appears to 
be little chance that peace will come soon to Gage Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
Palos said Community in Action is considering a second, and larger, petition 
drive calling for Almada to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
And Quinones said his group plans another demonstration against the five 
teachers.

'KIDS ARE SCARED' IN DRIVE-BY KILLING WAVE;

<P>
GANGS: THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HAS ASSIGNED UP TO NINE MORE PATROL CARS AND 
MORE DETECTIVES TO HELP KEEP PEACE IN VOLATILE SOUTH NORWALK.

<P>
For officials from the city and the Sheriff's Department, it's the same 
routine: more patrols, a funeral for the victim and a community meeting to end 
gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
Emiliano Landa, 12, was the fourth person slain in a gang-related incident in 
Norwalk this year. He was fatally wounded Monday in a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Since the shooting, the Sheriff's Department has assigned up to nine more 
patrol cars to help keep peace in volatile south Norwalk. More anti-gang 
detectives have also been assigned. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll keep it up as long as we can," Sheriff's Lt. John Radeleff said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk's community workers, who are part of the city's new anti-gang program, 
have also stepped up their rounds in a bid to calm nerves and keep hostilities 
from erupting in the poor neighborhood of one-way streets where Landa was shot. 
The streets are bordered by Norwalk and Pioneer boulevards on the east and west 
and Excelsior Drive and Alondra Boulevard on the north and south. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are scared," Norwalk community worker George del Junco said. "It takes it 
real close to home when one of their home boys gets shot." 
</P>
<P>
Del Junco was making funeral arrangements for the family. 
</P>
<P>
The city has scheduled a community meeting Wednesday to educate parents about 
gangs. City officials will also try to establish a Neighborhood Watch group in 
the Hayford Street area, where Emiliano was shot, Norwalk public safety 
coordinator Kevin Gano said. 
</P>
<P>
Such a group was established in the Barrio Norwalk district to the south after 
a gang member was shot to death there in June. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Luigi A. Vernola said the City Council will also consider offering an 
award leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect in the Emiliano's 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's imperative that we let people know that the city wants these people 
brought to trial," Vernola said. "If we have to offer an award, we'll do that. 
We don't want them on the streets. We want them behind bars." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the city's rewards have not been successful. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989 the council offered a $5,000 reward after Juan Enriquez, a 17-year-old 
honor student at John Glenn High School, was killed in a drive-by shooting as 
he walked home from school. 
</P>
<P>
The council also offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest 
of gang members who shot Jesus E. Diaz, 16, at a graduation party in June. Diaz 
was reportedly a member of Artesia's Chivas gang who had strayed into the turf 
of longtime rivals Barrio Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been arrested in either of those slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators have received many tips on Monday's shooting, but no 
one has been arrested, said Sgt. Al Grotefend, supervisor of the Norwalk gang 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
There had been fear of retaliation after the Diaz slaying, but there is no 
evidence that Monday's slaying is related, Grotefend said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether they intended to hit (Emiliano) or not, we have no way of knowing," 
Grotefend said. "With a lot of these gangs, they don't care who they hit. They 
just care that it's someone in the gang area." 
</P>
<P>
The community meeting will start at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday at the city's Social 
Service Center, 11929 Alondra Blvd.

Officials in this tiny upscale city are furious with the results of the 1990 
U.S. Census, and plan to do their own nose-counting to prove that they have at 
least 100 more residents than the 816 logged by census takers. 
</P>
<P>
"Trust me, I've been here 18 years and I know everyone who's died and who's 
been born, and our population has not gone down," said an irate City Manager 
Dolly Vollaire. 
</P>
<P>
Vollaire said she will send her staff of three on a counting mission this week 
to disprove the census results, which show Bradbury slipping from 846 to 816 
residents over the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
A discrepancy of 30 residents may not seem like much to most folks, but to 
Bradbury, an upscale residential enclave without the sales-tax generating 
commercial developments of most cities, each additional resident translates 
into extra federal and state money. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously they did not go up the driveways of some of those estates," she 
huffed. "When they're building 14,000-square-foot homes, someone's got to be 
living in them." DENISE HAMILTON

WEST HOLLYWOOD: THE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT'S NEW PATROL UNIT IS QUIETLY,BUT 
QUICKLY, PEDALING ITS WAY ONTO THE CRIME-FIGHTING SCENE. 
</P>

<P>
By the time the deputies rounded the corner on their mountain bikes and smelled 
the pungent aroma, the three middle-aged pot smokers didn't have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
They were caught, red-handed, and they had nowhere to hide. Nowhere to run, 
either, since the deputies would easily overtake them on their standard-issue 
bicycles -- even if they ran onto the sidewalk or down alleys. The smokers just 
stood there, stunned. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery suspect outside the McDonald's had no chance either. The bike 
patrol caught up with him as he lingered for a moment, still illuminated by the 
glow of the golden arches. They sat him down, cuffed him and went riding off, 
looking for his partner in crime. 
</P>
<P>
There were other members of the seamy underside of West Hollywood taken by 
surprise that night -- drug addicts, prostitutes, and run-of-the-mill lowlifes. 
</P>
<P>
Most people, though, saw the two-member patrol whiz by and registered a look of 
shock and amusement. 
</P>
<P>
It was all in a night's work for the two sheriff's deputies, members of a 
specialized team at the vanguard of what its supporters say is the way of the 
future -- cops on bikes. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the idea has caught on in many communities, starting in 1987 in 
Seattle, where bike patrols have an arrest record far more impressive than 
their car-riding counterparts, according to Seattle Police Officer Paul Grady, 
who trained the first members of West Hollywood's new crime-fighting team. 
</P>
<P>
The West Hollywood unit, composed of six deputies riding in teams of two, was 
among the first of its kind in California when it started about a month ago. At 
least eight more deputies will be added to the team shortly, and Sheriff's 
Deputy Sean Collinsworth, who brought the idea to West Hollywood, is now 
training bike patrol officers in three divisions of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. Collinsworth says other departments are not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent night, Collinsworth and his partner, Deputy Craig Flick, 
accompanied by a Times reporter and photographer, slithered through traffic and 
weaved around startled pedestrians on sidewalks. They cruised through the nooks 
and crannies and alleys and garages of the city, through all the hidden places 
where crooks head to escape the watchful eye of police. 
</P>
<P>
Most police, that is. But not the bike patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the two deputies were outfitted with all the standard equipment -- 
9-millimeter Beretta pistols, badges, radio transmitters, handcuffs, large 
Sheriff's Department insignias on their shirts and even larger billy clubs -- 
they roamed the streets as if they were invisible. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't even register that we're cops," said Collinsworth, after he cruised 
up to a transient sitting on a Santa Monica Boulevard ledge and took his beer 
away from him. "If we were in a black-and-white (squad car), he'd have dumped 
it. The same thing with the dope (smokers)." 
</P>
<P>
Time and again, by the time the deputies announced, "Sheriff's Department Bike 
Patrol," they were close enough to their quarry to see what kind of cigarette 
they were smoking, close enough to catch them at whatever suspicious act they 
were committing, or close enough -- if they were law-abiding -- to chat with 
them about life in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood covers 1.9 square miles, so all of it can be seen from a bike, 
and a lot more than would be seen from a squad car or by police officers on 
foot. And probably a lot more than most people want to see -- unless you're a 
cop. 
</P>
<P>
Collinsworth and Flick say they have caught many criminals in the act, from 
prostitutes performing in parking structures to hit-and-run drivers. Their 
bikes have spotlights and fat tires that enable them to climb stairs, go up 
curbs and buzz through all kinds of terrain. 
</P>
<P>
The bikes do more than afford deputies the element of surprise. They are able 
to respond to calls as fast as squad cars in many instances -- faster during 
rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the radio call about the elderly man being robbed outside the 
McDonald's, the deputies raced a half-mile to the restaurant at the corner of 
Detroit Street and Santa Monica. They got there in time to nab the suspect 
before most officers could get out of their squad cars. 
</P>
<P>
And while the other officers milled about on foot, Collinsworth and Flick 
scoured the area, in vain, for a second suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Some deputies, though, say they'd rather keep their squad cars. 
</P>
<P>
"I like driving people around and taking (suspects) to jail," instead of 
calling in for backup units like bike patrol deputies have to do, Deputy Joe 
Morales said during a stop at Astro Burgers. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," he said, pointing to Collinsworth and Flick, "they're in much better 
shape than I am." 
</P>
<P>
The bike cops take a lot of good-natured ribbing about their patrols, and their 
bulky bike helmets, khaki shorts and special bike shoes. And because they had 
to pass rigorous medical tests, jokes abound about them having to cut out the 
coffee and doughnuts and having to keep a ready supply of sun block. 
</P>
<P>
"But the jokes and jeers have stopped," said Flick, as they brought the robbery 
suspect to squad cars waiting at McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
"We're bringing in arrests and citations. We're handling our weight, doing 
everything they do in (squad) cars." 
</P>
<P>
Collinsworth, who at 34 has 12 years on the force, obviously enjoyed the 
good-natured banter with those we met on the street the most, even the most 
unsavory ones. Throughout his 3-to-11 p.m. shift, he'd ride up to questionable 
people, ask what they were doing, search them for drugs, check for IDs and 
track marks, and tell them to get busy or get lost. 
</P>
<P>
Flick, 24, and three years on the force, was more introverted and soft-spoken. 
Unlike Collinsworth, who has ridden bicycles the 12 miles to and from work for 
years, Flick is still adapting to life on two wheels. He says the last month's 
worth of riding has gotten him in better physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
"You been using, Philip?" Collinsworth asks a sullen, shaky adolescent standing 
in a parking lot along Santa Monica Boulevard frequented by male prostitutes. 
"Where you been?" 
</P>
<P>
After receiving a noncommittal response, Collinsworth hops off his bike, pats 
Philip down, inspects his veins, and says: "You've got 15 minutes to find a 
boyfriend, Philip. I don't want to see you here when we come back." 
</P>
<P>
On the next trip by the parking lot, Philip is nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing "Dave" hanging out with two other men in another parking lot, 
Collinsworth is next to the pasty-faced young man before he can finish his 
sentence. He pats all three down for drugs, asks Dave when he got out of jail 
and warns the other two that Dave sells drugs. He gives them a "pep talk," 
saying, "If you're even in the area again, I'll find a reason to bust you." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, such warnings work. Because of their constant presence, the bike 
patrols deter crime by scaring away the hustlers, Collinsworth and Flick say. 
The three pot-smokers, after getting a scolding from Collinsworth, even say 
they think the bike patrols are a great idea. 
</P>
<P>
"They're quiet, and fast. As we learned tonight," said one of the men, who was 
standing near the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard, the major artery that 
the bike detail patrols. 
</P>
<P>
The patrols also make for good public relations. As the deputies ride past 
Sherry Scott, walking her dog with her mother, Scott initiates a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Curious at first, they say the idea of bike patrols makes them feel safe. "I 
love it," Scott says. "They're more in shape and ready to go (than other 
officers). And they're friendlier." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Vincent, sitting on the front porch of his Poinsettia Place home, tells the 
officers of drug-dealing prostitutes living down the street, and how much he 
likes the patrols. "I'm really jazzed to see you guys patrolling," he says. 
"Every time I see you, I go, 'Hurrah.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is too early to glean hard statistics on the success of the West Hollywood 
program, Collinsworth and Flick said. But they said arrests are up, crime is 
down, and people say they feel safer than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"We see more, hear more, smell more," Collinsworth says. "We are closer to our 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as they ride through once crime-infested Plummer Park at 8:45 p.m., 
children stop their playing and smile, while senior citizens chat animatedly. 
As they pedal onto the grass and through the park courtyard, they pass a 
classroom where an orchestra plays. The musicians look up and wave. 
</P>
<P>
At the park, as in other areas where they patrol, the bike cops are a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a Russian fruit vendor here that gives us fruit," Flick says. "He 
loves us. We scare away the prostitutes that steal his food." 
</P>
<P>
There are personal benefits too. The two deputies are in great shape, although 
maybe a little sore from riding. And they can rest easy knowing they are 
alleviating smog and the nation's dependence on oil in their own way. 
</P>
<P>
"And where else," asks Collinsworth, the avid cyclist, "can you ride to work, 
ride around at work, take people to jail and then ride home?" 
</P>

WORKER COMP FILES SEIZED IN COMPTON

<P>
The school district has canceled its contract with a company hired last year to 
administer its Workers' Compensation plan and ordered school police to remove 
the district's files from the firm's office. 
</P>
<P>
Compton Unified School District officials would not answer questions about the 
action or about the district's relationship with the firm, Golden State 
Administrators of Compton. 
</P>
<P>
Financial records in the office of the Los Angeles County superintendent of 
schools show that the district's costs for Workers' Compensation jumped nearly 
50% after it hired Golden State in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
For the 1989-90 school year, the district paid $4.3 million for administration, 
doctor bills and salaries of employees injured on the job. The year before, 
when another firm, Bierly and Associates of Pasadena, administered the 
district's claims, the cost was only $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
At its meeting June 26, the district board of trustees voted to renew Golden 
State's contract for six more months. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State is what is known as a third-party administrator. Employers -- 
public and private -- are allowed to hire such firms to handle their Workers' 
Compensation programs. The administrator is paid a fee for processing and 
paying claims and is given funds with which to pay the doctors and employees' 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Compton paid Golden State a fee of about $19,500 a month.

POTBELLIED PIGS TO BE LEGAL, NO HOGWASH; 
</P>
<P>
PETS: MONTEREY PARK RESIDENTS WILL SOON BE ALLOWED TO KEEP MINIATURE VIETNAMESE 
PORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Vietnamese potbellied pigs are about to be granted legal status in Monterey 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council last week unanimously gave preliminary approval for residents 
to keep the miniature pigs as pets, one per household. The council is scheduled 
to take a final vote on the proposed law Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
The pigs, which can weigh from 30 pounds to close to 200 pounds, are short and 
black, have bristly fur and sport round little bellies that hang almost to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Like many cities, Monterey Park had banned all types of swine, as well as cows, 
sheep and other farm animals. But city officials have decided the law is 
hogwash when it comes to potbellied pigs, which are smaller and more 
unobtrusive than their larger pink cousins. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park council members were adamant about keeping the door closed to all 
other livestock. 
</P>
<P>
"Hogs will not be permitted," Councilwoman Marie Purvis said. "Please don't run 
out and buy a hog." 
</P>
<P>
Other cities are not so flexible in their treatment of miniature pigs. La Habra 
Heights, which allows farm animals in general, will permit a family to own a 
pig only on a lot of at least 20,000 square feet. Gerald and Kathleen 
Hartinger, who raised two miniature pigs on a 17,000-square-foot lot in the 
city, have said they'll move rather than surrender their pets. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles residents are not allowed pigs of any kind unless the pigs are 
penned on land zoned for agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Known scientifically as Sus scrofa bittatus, the Vietnamese potbellied pig can 
be housebroken, Monterey Park Police Capt. Jim Strait said. Strait consulted 
with local animal control officials before recommending that the law be 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new fad to have miniature pigs as pets," Strait said. "They're very 
cute. You can keep them in the yard like a dog, train them just like a dog. You 
can teach them to come. They're supposed to be smarter than dogs." 
</P>
<P>
They're also very expensive: $1,500 for a male, $5,000 for a female, Strait 
said. "It's not the kind of thing you'd just barbecue and eat," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Arnold, a 1-year-old potbellied porker who lives at the Monterey Park 
home of Sally McComb, sister of Fire Chief Allen E. McComb. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold's favorite pastimes are splashing in a portable pool on a hot summer 
day, snuggling under his electric blanket when it's cold, and eating grapes and 
dog food, Fire Chief McComb said. He even shares a doggy door with the McCombs' 
German shepherd, Gretchen. 
</P>
<P>
"Arnold has become attached to me," he said. "The pig, my nephew and myself 
celebrated our birthdays together."

IN MONTEREY PARK, POLICE WHO COLLAR RECRUITS GET DAY OFF 
</P>

<P>
Want a day off work? If you're a police officer, simply recruit a new 
colleague. 
</P>
<P>
As an incentive to police officers to attract high-caliber colleagues, the City 
Council last week voted to give officers a day off work each time they bring in 
an officer applicant who is hired. 
</P>
<P>
The concept isn't new: Capt. Daniel Cross said he knows of several cities that 
reward police officer recruiters with cash. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, for instance, any full-time city employee who successfully recruits 
an officer receives $250 upon hiring of the officer and another $250 after the 
recruit passes a one-year probationary period, Investigator Rick Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park's plan "is a way of rewarding them without spending money and 
burdening the taxpayer," Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
The recruitment incentive program comes as Monterey Park is recovering from a 
rash of defections that at one point left six positions vacant out of the 
department's authorized strength of 74 officers. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the dissension was blamed on former Chief Kenneth Hickman, who resigned 
in March after a unanimous vote of no-confidence from the Police Officers Assn. 
He was replaced by Chief Robert W. Collins. 
</P>
<P>
After Hickman's departure, city officials took steps to improve morale and 
retention in the department. One of those measures was to put patrol officers 
on a 12 1/2-hour, three-day work week designed to cut down on overtime and 
reduce officers' commute time. 
</P>
<P>
The department also began testing applicants more frequently -- monthly instead 
of semiannually. Under the old system, Cross said, Monterey Park ran the risk 
of losing qualified applicants who went to other cities rather than waiting for 
the next test. 
</P>
<P>
The extra efforts have paid off, Cross said, adding that the more potential 
recruits that pour in, the more selective the department can be. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably have more people applying now than we have in the past," he said. 
"It was real bad last year. It was a very big problem because the spot would 
stay vacant for some time."

SEES THE BENEFITS IN COLUMBIA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the Culver City council's pending decision about granting Columbia 
Studios permission to build several tall office towers on their lot: I think 
they should allow it. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen worries about excess traffic and out-of-place development never 
bothered them when they approved the Marina Place Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's because this time they have to answer to the people who would be 
impacted, but they should apply the same logic here -- that the overriding 
benefits of the tax revenue and prestige will justify the gridlock. Maybe then 
they could forget about Marina Place?

CIVIC LIGHT OPERA NAMES ART DIRECTOR

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach Civic Light Opera has named Barry Brown, a well-known Broadway 
producer, as its new artistic director, effective Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"We're elated," opera executive director Pegge Logefeil said. 
</P>
<P>
"He brings . . . a fresh new vision and scope . . . that ensures our audiences 
of a new era of artistic excellence and professionalism." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a Hollywood resident, replaces Martin Wiviott, who announced his 
resignation in June to accept a similar position with the Los Angeles Civic 
Light Opera. Among other things, Brown has won Tony awards for his productions 
of "La Cage Aux Folles" and the current hit revival of "Gypsy." He also 
produced an Emmy-winning PBS special called "Broadway Sings the Music of Jule 
Styne," as well as more than 10 Broadway shows and a dozen benefits, including 
"The Best of the Best," the first major benefit in America to raise money to 
fight acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
According to a press release announcing the appointment, Brown intends to mount 
more original shows in Long Beach, including some that will go on tour and 
possibly even end up on Broadway.

2 SOUGHT FOR BURGLARIES IN MONROVIA

MONROVIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police last week told residents to be on the lookout for two suspected burglars 
who are believed responsible for robbing at least 18 homes since late July 
while their victims were inside. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called hot-prowlers, who have not harmed any of the occupants, are also 
suspected of burglaries in Arcadia and neighboring unincorporated areas, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia Police Chief Joseph Santoro urged residents to report any suspicious 
activity, but he warned against confronting the burglars, who he said may 
become dangerous if they are startled or feel trapped. 
</P>
<P>
"Hot-prowlers are among the most difficult of criminals to capture because they 
specialize in quickness and stealth," Santoro said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the crimes have occurred between 8 p.m. and 3:30 a.m., and in almost 
every case the prowler entered by taking off a screen and climbing through an 
open window, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects frequently look for purses or wallets left out in plain sight, and 
they usually take cash or jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
One suspect, who has struck repeatedly in the western part of town, is 
described by witnesses as a male Anglo or Latino in his 20s who has been 
wearing black clothing. 
</P>
<P>
A second suspect, a black male also in his 20s, has committed burglaries in the 
southeastern and north-central areas of the city. On one occasion, he 
reportedly simulated having a gun when confronted by a victim, but he never 
actually revealed one, police said.

APARTMENT LIFE: BILLED TO CLEAN UNIT HE NEVER OCCUPIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN B. POSTEMA, Postema is the editor of Apartment Age magazine, a 
publication of The Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an apartment owners' 
service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I live in Temecula (Riverside County) and a few years ago, I signed a 
one-year lease and got the keys for an apartment here. Before I even moved in, 
I decided that I didn't want the apartment. I called the manager and told him 
that I had changed my mind. 
</P>
<P>
He said to "put it in writing" and return the key. He also said that I wouldn't 
get my month's rent or security deposit back (about $1,000). 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that now I have a bill for an additional $300 that was sent to a 
collection agency and is also now appearing on my TRW credit report. The bill 
says that I owe three days' added rent plus cleaning costs. The point is, I 
never even moved in to the place. What recourse do I have? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: With a one-year lease you are liable for unpaid rent through the end of 
the lease term, one year, or until the unit is rerented, assuming the owner 
makes "good faith" efforts to rerent it. 
</P>
<P>
If the owner can document $1,300 total lost rent, your only recourse may be to 
pay the $300. Cleaning charges, however, would seem difficult to document if, 
as you say, you "never even moved in" unless you somehow caused the unit to 
become dirty or otherwise require cleaning before moving in. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, for an amount in dispute under $2,000, you would seek redress in your 
local Small Claims Court. However, you are probably precluded from filing an 
action there because of the court's statute of limitations, one year. 
</P>
<P>
If your deposit has been improperly retained, i.e., if the owner rerented the 
unit immediately and lost no rent, you can sue for a refund and penalties (CC 
1950.5) in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
You should ask the owner/manager of the property for an accounting of expenses. 
If it looks reasonable, you should probably pay the money. If not, you may want 
to consult an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renters' Insurance Not a 'Monopoly' 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been renting an apartment in Beverly Hills for two years now. Some 
time ago, I remember reading in Apartment Life that it is a good idea to invest 
in apartment renters' insurance. I decided to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
After looking around for companies that carry such insurance, I have given up 
because I can only find one company that carries this kind of insurance. I am 
afraid that this possible "monopoly" would charge me an unreasonable amount for 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Can you recommend a few companies and list the advantages and disadvantages to 
investing in apartment insurance? 
</P>
<P>
A: Rest easy. There is no renters' insurance monopoly. Several reputable 
insurance companies offer it. Some include Farmers Insurance Group, State Farm 
Insurance Cos., Allstate Insurance Cos. and the Prudential Insurance Co. of 
America, among others. 
</P>
<P>
There are no real disadvantages to having the insurance, except, perhaps, the 
cost of the premiums. 
</P>
<P>
The advantages of such policies are many. Most cover fires, slip-and-fall 
injuries and temporary relocation costs due to other such disasters. When those 
disasters occur, apartment owners' insurance policies generally cover only the 
owners' losses. Without renters' insurance, tenants are on their own when any 
of these disasters occur. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
14-Day Limit on Returning Deposits 
</P>
<P>
Q: Would you please advise me on how long my Anaheim landlord can keep my 
security deposit before refunding it after I move out? He claims that he can 
keep it for between six to eight weeks before he's required to refund anything. 
I think that's ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
Also, does the six to eight weeks, or whatever it is, start after I give him 
notice or after I move out? 
</P>
<P>
A: You'll be pleased to know that the state Legislature, which governs refunds 
of such deposits, agrees with you that six to eight weeks is too long to wait 
for your refund. Under state law, your landlord must refund you any amounts due 
from your security deposit within two weeks (14 calendar days) after you move 
out. The only time that's close to six weeks is when you include the 30-day 
notice period, required under state law, with the two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tenant Wants His Bounced Check Back 
</P>
<P>
Q: I wrote a recent check for one month's rent at my Los Angeles apartment and 
it bounced. I subsequently paid my bank a $10 not-sufficient-funds penalty and 
I also paid the apartment building's $10 penalty fee. Since the apartment's 
policy wouldn't let the manager put the check through the bank again, I then 
had to pay the rent with a money order. All of this is fine. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, I'm moving, and I want my check back. I don't want them putting 
it through the bank at some other time. The manager says the owner's policy 
requires him to hold the check in my file, and I don't get it back. Can I get 
my check back? What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: This question is trickier than it appears. The simplest and best thing for 
you to do to alleviate your anxieties may be to go to your bank, close your 
account and reopen a new one. 
</P>
<P>
Although you can put a "stop payment" on the check, most banks require you to 
re-stop payment on the check from every six months to every eight months, and 
sometimes as often as monthly. The cost for this bank service ranges from $7 to 
$10 each time you use it. 
</P>
<P>
To try to "force" the owner to return the check through some kind of a court 
action or by some other means doesn't seem as easy or cost-effective as simply 
getting a new account, which costs very little.

FRANK SINATRA and his wife, BARBARA, have purchased an oceanfront tear-down in 
Malibu for about $3 million, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
They bought on Broad Beach, where such other celebrities as Dustin Hoffman, 
Steven Spielberg, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Dinah Shore live. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sinatras got a fabulous buy," said Robert Rubenstein of Malibu Realty 
Inc., who didn't participate in the transaction but has listings on some new 
homes on the same street at about $9 million each. 
</P>
<P>
"The lots for my listings were sold for $3 million each, and that didn't 
include a house," Rubenstein said. "He (Sinatra) can call his a remodel and not 
have to go through all the Coastal Commission hearings (that new construction 
entails); that adds up to a good savings." 
</P>
<P>
The Sinatras' property, about a third of an acre, has a two-story, 31-year-old 
house on it with five bedrooms and 4 1/2 baths in 2,858 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Sinatras' architect, Ted Grenzbach, was unavailable for comment, and the 
real estate broker who handled both sides of the deal, Jerry Pritchett, said he 
couldn't discuss the transaction or the Sinatras' plans. 
</P>
<P>
Ol' Blue Eyes, who sang to a sellout Radio City Music Hall crowd in May at the 
age of 74 and shared the bill with comedian Don Rickles in a program last 
Sunday on Long Island, also has a home in Beverly Hills. He bought that 
property in 1986, just before he sold a bachelor pad that he built nearby in 
the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
The singer/actor's main residence is a nine-home compound in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
SHELLY GARRETT, former actor-turned-playwright and producer, just purchased a 
new house in Walnut for $870,000, and he's already customizing it by changing a 
game room into a theater and adding a black-bottom swimming pool with caves, 
according to the listing agent. 
</P>
<P>
The house has six bedrooms, 5 1/2 baths and about 6,300 square feet. It's in a 
quiet area with equestrian trails. 
</P>
<P>
"He bought it so he could have a place to write," said the listing agent, 
Pamela Blakeslee of Century 21/Young Realty in West Covina, "but he travels a 
lot, because he has several shows on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, who produced beauty pageants to pay his bills while struggling as a TV 
actor with bit parts in such programs as "Baretta" and "Police Woman," has 
emerged as one of the first successful black presenters of theatrical comedy 
since his play "Beauty Shop" was a sellout in Los Angeles last year. 
</P>
<P>
Even former Presidents apparently aren't immune from real estate slumps: 
</P>
<P>
RICHARD M. NIXON and his wife, PAT, have dropped the asking price on their 
seven-bedroom, Saddle River, N.J., home from $3.25 million to $2,995,000. The 
7,000- to 8,000-square-foot house, on four acres, came on the market in May. 
</P>
<P>
And HARRY REINSCH, former president of Bechtel Corp., and his wife, HELEN, have 
reduced the price on their South Laguna home from $22 million to $12.9 million 
-- "but not in one drop," said Betty Comegys of Waterfront Homes, who has the 
listing. "They reduced it to $18 million in January." 
</P>
<P>
The 18,500-square-foot house, on slightly more than an acre, was listed a year 
ago June, about the same time that two nearby homes also came on the market at 
$22 million, the highest price known to be asked for a private home in Orange 
County. Those homes also have been reduced, one to $18 million; the other, to 
$15.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
JULIAN LENNON is on the move again: 
</P>
<P>
For the third time in less than three years, the pop musician, son of the late 
John Lennon, is changing residences. 
</P>
<P>
He was due to close escrow after our press time last week on a home in the 
Beverly Hills Post Office Area at close to its $1,525,000 asking price, and 
he's put the home he bought last October, off Mulholland Drive, on the market 
at $1,295,000. 
</P>
<P>
He bought that home when he sold an estate in the Santa Monica Mountains that 
was used as the site of a World War II bunker. 
</P>
<P>
"He's selling the home he bought last year because he likes the other house 
(that he just purchased)," said Erin Caldwell, a vice president of Alvarez, 
Hyland &amp; Young, who represented Lennon in his purchase and has his listing. 
</P>
<P>
"He likes the views, trees, big lawn and pool; he likes the country feel to it, 
with its pitched beam ceilings. And he likes its privacy." 
</P>
<P>
His new home is off a private drive and has three bedrooms and two baths in a 
3,000-square-foot main house, which was built 55 years ago but has been 
completely remodeled, according to Caldwell. The property, about a third of an 
acre, also has a guest apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The home that he's just listed -- a gated, 1930s Mediterranean-style residence 
-- has three bedrooms, three baths, a used-brick motor court for six cars; a 
black-bottom swimming pool, fountains, ponds, orchids and ferns. 
</P>
<P>
Music producer DON WAS, whose 11-member band Was (Not Was) released its album 
"Are You Okay?" in July, has purchased a two-acre estate on Mulholland Drive in 
the Beverly Hills Post Office Area for nearly its $1.5-million asking price, 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
The property has a recently remodeled three-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot main 
house and a two-bedroom, 1,000-square-foot guest house, both with views of the 
San Fernando Valley. Was had been living in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanine Sales of Stan Herman &amp; Associates represented both parties in the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Director/screenwriter DAVID TWOHY bought a get-away home for himself in Big 
Bear. 
</P>
<P>
Twohy directed "The Grand Tour," which filmed this spring in Oregon and stars 
Jeff Daniels, and he wrote the screenplay for "The Fugitive," which will begin 
production soon for Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Twohy's mountain hideaway has four bedrooms and three baths in 2,000 square 
feet. He paid $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old bachelor, who was working nights as a bartender until recently, 
also owns a 1,500-square-foot condo in Santa Monica.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: HOW TO 'JUMP AHEAD' ON MORTGAGE AND SAVE THOUSANDS OF 
DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Some time ago you wrote that it is smart to make an extra mortgage 
principal payment each month and "jump ahead" on the loan amortization 
schedule. Does it matter if the lender is a private party or a lending 
institution? Does the "jump ahead" plan work in all states? If the borrower is 
unable to keep making extra payments each month, what effect would this have on 
the program? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Whenever I write about the "jump ahead" mortgage prepayment program 
borrowers get all excited about paying off their 30-year mortgages in just 15 
years and saving thousands of interest dollars. The program is so simple and 
inexpensive it's a wonder everyone doesn't use it. 
</P>
<P>
Before answering your questions, let me explain how the jump-ahead loan 
prepayment plan works. The first step is to get a copy of your home loan's 
amortization schedule from the lender for the life of the mortgage, usually 30 
years. The second step is to remember you always must pay at least your regular 
monthly mortgage payment every month. The third step is to add to that minimum 
payment the next month's principal payment from the amortization schedule. 
</P>
<P>
For example, suppose your regular monthly mortgage payment is $1,000. To keep 
things very simple, let's pretend, and this isn't far from reality, that this 
month's loan payment will be allocated $990 to interest and $10 to reduce the 
loan's principal balance. Looking at the loan amortization schedule, we see 
next month's payment will be allocated $989 to interest and $11 to principal. 
Using the jump ahead plan, you write a check to the lender this month for 
$1,011. which is your regular $1,000 payment plus next month's $11 principal 
payment. Be sure to tell the lender the extra $11 is for principal. 
</P>
<P>
When your loan payment comes due next month, which is to be allocated $988 for 
interest and $12 for principal, send the lender an extra $13 for the following 
month's principal payment so you can jump ahead again on your amortization 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
What have you accomplished in just two months by making an $11 and a $13 extra 
principal payment in our simple example? You have jumped ahead two months on 
your loan amortization schedule, thereby saving $989 interest for next month 
and $987 interest for the following month. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure you get the idea. Now to answer your questions: This plan works with 
all lenders on amortized loans. However, if your loan interest is calculated 
daily on a simple interest basis, it doesn't work. The plan works in all 
states. If you can't make your gradually increasing extra principal payment 
each month, you can always revert back to your minimum required monthly 
payment. But then you stop jumping ahead and saving interest every month by 
cutting the term of your mortgage. 
</P>

Fixing Up Home Still a Good Investment 
</P>
<P>
Q: The only real estate my wife and I own is our home. We bought it about six 
years ago and it has proven to be an excellent investment, since it has 
appreciated handsomely in market value. But we are kicking ourselves because we 
sold a nearby house that my wife inherited about three years ago. That house 
also has appreciated in value nicely, but we don't own it. 
</P>
<P>
We have been looking around for good real estate investments to buy, but we 
can't find any that make financial sense. Rental houses don't produce enough 
income and we hear apartment buildings can be a management headache. Any 
suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: I agree it is very difficult to buy real estate investment property that 
makes financial sense. How unfortunate that you sold the house your wife 
inherited because her investment was virtually zero and even a slight increase 
in market value is a tremendous yield. 
</P>
<P>
But we can learn from our mistakes. Just as your home and that inherited house 
appreciated in market value, chances are that will happen again in the future. 
However, rather than wait for inflation to force real estate values up, why not 
do something to push up the value of property you acquire. 
</P>
<P>
I think fixer-upper houses offer the best profit potential today, if you can 
buy them far enough below market value. My goal is $2 of increased market value 
for each $1 spent on improving fix-up property. Although I don't always reach 
that goal, I come close enough. 
</P>
<P>
My suggestion is to buy run-down houses in good areas of your town. Look for 
distress properties, such as foreclosures, probate properties, IRS tax seizure 
sales and sheriff's sales. Then fix them up for either immediate resale or 
long-term investment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Much Fix-Up Should Seller Do? 
</P>
<P>
Q: In a few months we plan to put our home on the market due to a job transfer. 
Before then we plan to paint it inside and outside. But we are wondering if we 
also should remodel the bathrooms and kitchen. I hate to think of the mess. 
They really aren't bad or very old-fashioned, but they could use some 
modernizing. Should we do this work? 
</P>
<P>
A: I suggest that you invite two or three local real estate agents to inspect 
your home and advise if the bathrooms and kitchen need renovation. Chances are 
you don't need to do that major work. 
</P>
<P>
But you are very wise to completely paint the house. In the process I presume 
you will clean and repair as necessary. Another profitable improvement, which 
usually doesn't cost much, is new carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to install a neutral color, such as beige, and put in the best padding 
you can get. Also check the landscaping to be sure your home presents a 
pleasing appearance because the first impression is very important. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is There Tax When Converting to Rental? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I bought my home about eight years ago for $45,000 and lived in it until 
last February, when I moved out and rented it to tenants. It was worth about 
$160,000 when I moved out. Will I have to pay any tax this year on my profit? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Since you did not sell your home, but just converted it to rental 
status, you have no sale profit and no capital gain tax to be concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
However, on Schedule E of your federal income tax return you must report the 
rental income received from the tenants. But you will be able to deduct 
applicable expenses such as mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, 
utilities and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, you can depreciate the lower of your adjusted cost basis or the 
fair market value of the property on the date of conversion to a rental house. 
However, the land value is not depreciable. Your $45,000 cost basis is 
obviously lower, but you can add to your basis the cost of any capital 
improvements, such as a room addition or remodeling work completed during 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Balloon Payment in Three Years Too Short 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are considering buying a home where the seller will finance the sale if 
we make a 10% down payment. However, she will only carry the 90% mortgage for 
three years. I think that is too short a time, don't you? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. A three-year balloon payment mortgage has too short a fuse. Three years 
will go by very quickly and if interest rates are high then you could lose the 
house if you can't afford to refinance. You will sleep much better if you can 
get the seller to carry back a five- or 10-year mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Get Remodeling Bids Before Buying House 
</P>
<P>
Q: Following your advice, we have been looking for bargain-priced houses which 
need fixing up. We found an ideal candidate in an excellent location. But we 
are uncertain as to the costs of remodeling it. Is there any way we can tie it 
up while we get bids on renovation? 
</P>
<P>
A: Of course. Make your home purchase offer in the usual way and get it 
accepted by the seller. There is no use getting renovation bids until you know 
you can buy the house at the price and terms you want. 
</P>
<P>
But be certain your offer contains a contingency clause such as, "This offer 
contingent on buyer obtaining satisfactory bids to renovate the property. 
Seller to permit reasonable inspections by buyer and contractors for this 
purpose. Buyer to notify seller in writing within 20 business days if such bids 
are unsatisfactory." Then you are protected if the remodeling costs are too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joint Tenancy Isn't Hard to Break Up 
</P>
<P>
Q: I took title to my house in joint tenancy with my girlfriend. The loan 
officer pushed us to take title as joint tenants with right of survivorship. He 
said we could change it later. But now my girlfriend refuses to change the 
title to tenants in common, so we can each make our one-half subject to our 
wills. How can I get out of this joint tenancy? 
</P>
<P>
A: In most states, one joint tenant can execute a quitclaim deed from himself 
as a joint tenant to himself as a tenant in common. Since there are only two 
joint tenants in your situation, such action ends the joint tenancy with right 
of survivorship. However, when a husband and wife hold title as joint tenants, 
the signatures of both spouses are required. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sewer Fee Should Be on Property Tax Bill 
</P>
<P>
Q: In our town each homeowner pays a $50 per month sewer service fee as part of 
the water bill. The purpose was to build a new sewer works. However, I have 
heard it would be better to add the sewer service fee to our real estate tax 
bill, so we can deduct it on our federal income tax returns. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Real estate taxes on your principal residence qualify as an itemized 
deduction on your federal income tax return. Since each homeowner in your town 
is paying $600 per year for that fancy new sewer works, it would be to your 
advantage to eliminate the sewer tax and increase your real estate taxes by 
that amount to make the $600 deductible on your federal tax returns. Many 
cities include sewer fees as part of the local property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seller Should Impose Time Limit on Clauses 
</P>
<P>
Q: Almost a month ago we signed a sales contract to sell our home. The buyer 
put a clause in the contract that says "Conditional upon buyer or his 
authorized agent inspecting and approving the property." So far, nobody has 
inspected the house. Our real estate agent says she can't push the buyer too 
hard, but I think we have given him enough time don't you? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The real estate agent should have insisted on a time limit for the 
inspection and approval. Without a specific time limit on that buyer's escape 
clause, if the matter should wind up in litigation, the judge will say the 
buyer has a "reasonable time." To one judge a reasonable time might be 30 days, 
another might say 60 days, or still another judge might feel 10 days is 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Since the buyer has already had over 30 days it would seem reasonable if you 
and the real estate agent notify the buyer in writing he has 10 additional days 
to inspect and approve the house or you will consider the condition waived and 
then proceed to closing of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
In the current buyer's market in most cities, the realty agent is correct not 
to push the buyer too hard. But you have waited a reasonable time and deserve 
to know if the sale is going to be completed or not.

SPEAKING OUT: AN UNBIASED LOOK AT L.A.'S HEART FINDS IT DOES HAVE A HEALTHY 
BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN E. FLUSTY, Flusty is a graduate student at the Southern California 
Institute of Architecture. His thesis project, House for 100,000, focuses on 
the creation of a network of public spaces along 3rd Street in downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Charles Lockwood's July 29 article "L.A.'s Heart's Failure: Where Are 
All the People": 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood's three-step method for making downtown the happiest place in L.A. 
betrays a half-spoken bias that suggests an explanation for downtown Los 
Angeles' failure to become a "people-pleasing" kind of place. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, those people currently taking pleasure in downtown seem to be 
considered at best a demographic group in need of dilution, at worst a blight 
requiring the social equivalent of the Bunker Hill "renaissance" of the last 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
While few would take issue with Lockwood's initial step, making downtown safer, 
cleaner and more inviting, the question must be asked: more inviting to whom? 
The answer becomes clear in steps two and three, simultaneously revealing the 
not-so-hidden agenda of much recent downtown development. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood correctly acknowledges the success of Broadway as a commercial mecca, 
yet goes on to state that Broadway's low-priced merchandise gives the street 
limited appeal. Obviously, Broadway's appeal is not so limited as to preclude 
mobs of shoppers packed belly to backside every weekend, so this lack of appeal 
must be not a quantitative, but a qualitative shortcoming. 
</P>
<P>
This assumption is confirmed in Lockwood's next paragraph, where he bemoans a 
dearth of comparatively well-heeled office workers shopping in the area, and 
the intent is driven home later in the article when Lockwood lauds Citicorp's 
Seventh Street Marketplace as a success. 
</P>
<P>
The message is apparent: A heavily utilized shopping street offering 
inexpensive merchandise to a bustling, low-income community demonstrates 
limited appeal, better to emulate a planned mall selling premium-priced 
merchandise to moderately sized groups of young white-collar professionals. 
</P>
<P>
These biases become all too clear in Lockwood's discussion of downtown area 
housing. He rightly suggests that the establishment of a full-time resident 
population is a prerequisite to a thriving downtown, but goes on to define this 
population as young professionals and office workers with no children who 
"enjoy downtown's ethnic diversity." 
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that these hypothetical residents would not be afforded the 
opportunity to enjoy that diversity for long since, in the process of moving 
into newly constructed moderate-price rental housing on the edges of downtown, 
they will be replacing the existing "ethnic" communities of non-office working 
families already living on downtown's edges. 
</P>
<P>
One suspects the ulterior goal is to entice "affluent Angelenos" into trading 
"Brentwood for Bunker Hill." Discussions of reinforcing the communities 
currently on downtown's edges, wholly responsible for Broadway's recent 
success, are conspicuously absent from Lockwood's strategy, as are 
considerations of recycling 7th Street and Broadway's office vacancies into 
low- to moderate-income housing servicing the needs of downtown's ill housed, 
or even the legions of unhoused whom Lockwood recognizes as an obstacle to 
making the area more pedestrian-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the term pioneer, we are inclined to picture the myth of the hardy 
settler wresting life from virgin soil, while we forget that this soil was 
acquired at the expense of other peoples already doing quite well for 
themselves on the same land. 
</P>
<P>
The new myth of the "urban pioneer" is no less insidious, as it falls prey to a 
similar fallacy. In both cases, a more appropriate definition of pioneer would 
be that of the military, a group of foot soldiers detailed to dig entrenchments 
in advance of an invasionary force's main body. 
</P>
<P>
The real issue of downtown L.A. is not Lockwood's smoke-and-mirrors debate for 
turning an alleged dead zone into a delightful expression of Angeleno civitas. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is one of turning a profit by replacing an existing population with 
a new one better able to provide a maximal short-term return on the 
considerable expense of acquiring and developing downtown property. L.A.'s 
heart has not failed. Rather, it is being failed by planners, developers and 
architects, many of whom seem to have no heart whatsoever.

If you have a perfect spot for a shade tree, plant it now. 
</P>
<P>
It will become established by spring and be better able to take the heat of

HANDYMAN Q &amp; A: KEEP CONCRETE MOIST FOR MAXIMUM STRENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I've been told that new concrete should be kept moist for at least 
three days while curing. I'm wondering just how much stronger can it get, and 
how long should it cure for maximum strength? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Keeping concrete moist helps the curing process. Concrete hardens as a 
result of a chemical reaction, called hydration, between cement and water, not 
because it dries. 
</P>
<P>
The hardening, or curing, continues as long as moisture remains in the 
concrete. If too much water is lost from the concrete through evaporation, the 
hardening process slows down or ceases. 
</P>
<P>
Concrete continues to gain strength after pouring for as long as it retains 
moisture, but the longer it moist-cures, the slower the rate of strength gain. 
</P>
<P>
Moist-curing concrete for 20 days more than doubles its strength compared to 
four days of moist-curing, which is considered a minimum. Although the greatest 
gain is in the first week or two after pouring, the curing process continues 
for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Concrete that is not moist-cured at all dries too rapidly, and reaches less 
than half its potential design strength. It will also have a greater number of 
shrinkage cracks. 
</P>
<P>
The most frequent moist-curing method is to spread moisture-retaining fabric, 
such as burlap, over the concrete after it has hardened enough to prevent 
surface damage. The fabric should be kept thoroughly soaked with a garden hose 
so that a film of water remains on the entire surface of the concrete 
throughout the curing period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Deal With Ceiling Water Stain 
</P>
<P>
Q: A water stain on my ceiling keeps bleeding through every time I repaint. How 
can I seal that stain for good? 
</P>
<P>
A: First, you have to be sure that you correct the problem that causes the 
staining. After stopping the flow of water, apply a coat of pigmented shellac 
over the stain. Wait a couple of weeks before applying the finish coat to be 
sure the problem has been solved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Work Safely While Doing Roofing 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own a 2 1/2-story home that needs reshingling, and I could use some tips 
on working safely on a multi-gabled, steeply pitched roof. I'm also wondering 
about the most economical and practical way to go about the job. The roof now 
has three layers of cedar shakes over tar paper and boards of varying widths. 
Many of the boards have 1- or 2-inch spaces between them. We like the shakes, 
but the cost seems prohibitive compared to asphalt shingles. 
</P>
<P>
A: For working safely on a roof, wear loose-fitting clothes so you can move 
around freely. Also wear soft-soled shoes to prevent slipping. High-top 
sneakers with good ankle support are recommended. Never go on a roof on a wet 
or windy day. Shingles can be slippery when wet. 
</P>
<P>
On a steep roof, the roofing ladder should be anchored in place with a bracket 
or framework that extends over the ridge or roof peak. This is especially 
important for roofs with a 4 to 12 pitch or greater. (The first number 
indicates how many feet the roof rises vertically for every 12 feet of 
horizontal distance.) You can also use roof brackets in conjunction with a 
ladder. 
</P>
<P>
The ladder's rungs provide a firm footing that will keep you from sliding down 
as well as convenient hand holds. Position the ladder so you won't have to 
reach out to the sides to work. If you do have to reach out sideways, always 
hold the ladder with the other hand and keep your hips between the ladder 
rails. 
</P>
<P>
As to reshingling, regardless of whether you use asphalt shingles or shakes, 
you will have to remove the existing three layers first. If you use wood 
shingles, these can go over existing boards. However, if you want to use 
asphalt, you'll have to cover the roofing boards with plywood sheathing. This 
is required to span the gaps between the boards so the asphalt shingles won't 
sag, forming horizontal grooves in the roof. 
</P>
<P>
You are concerned about the cost difference between shakes and asphalt 
shingles. Wood shingles are considerably more expensive than asphalt -- as much 
as three or four times the cost -- and are more time-consuming to install. A 
professional might charge five to six times as much for the shakes. 
</P>
<P>
Asphalt shingles come in various weight classes from 210 to 400 pounds per 
roofing square. A roofing square is 100 square feet. The heavier the shingles, 
the greater their durability and the higher the cost. The cost for 
top-of-the-line asphalt shingles, however, compares favorably with that of 
ordinary wood shingles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Covering Hole Left by Removing Heaters 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently installed a central heating system in my home. The old heaters, 
measuring 20-by-60 inches, are mounted back to back in the wall between rooms. 
Removing these units will leave a huge pass-through between the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
I want to frame out the openings and repair the walls so the patch won't be 
noticeable. Should I use lath and plaster, or should I try to make a flush 
patch with easier-to-handle wallboard? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you want a perfectly smooth wall, you should cover the entire wall from 
corner to corner with wallboard. It's very difficult to achieve perfection with 
a patch. Depending on how light strikes the wall, you will see ripple shadows 
at the patched joints. 
</P>
<P>
But, if you intend to hang pictures on this wall or cover it with a textured 
paint or wallpaper, patching would be adequate. Because of the size of the 
opening, filling it with wallboard would be best.

WHAT CAUSES A YELLOW VIOLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joel Rapp 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rather than the usual blue-and pink-producing anthocyanins, which belong to a 
large group of plant compounds collectively called flavonoids, Blansit's plants 
contained a group of flavonoids, closely related to the anthocyanins, called 
flavonols. 
</P>
<P>
It is the flavanols that create the yellow colors in flowers, and Blansit's Big 
Yellow was the first reported occurrence of flavonols in African violets. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jeff Smith of Norman, Okla., who was one of the first scientists 
to examine Blansit's plants, "Studies of the synthesis of flavonoids in plants 
indicate that their production is a step-by-step process requiring many 
different enzymes. The loss of an enzyme is typically a mutation inherited as a 
recessive trait. 
</P>
<P>
"Yellow African violets," Smith said, "are the result of the loss of the enzyme 
needed to convert flavonols into anthocyanins. The flavonols accumulate in the 
petals instead of anthocyanins and the resulting color is yellow. 
</P>
<P>
"In many species of plants, the failure to complete the anthocyanin synthesis 
would result in flavonols that are pale in color. Nature, however, has favored 
Blansit's African violets with flavonols that contain methyl groups that 
produce substances which are distinctly yellow. 
</P>
<P>
"The yellow in Nolan's plants is very distinct, supporting the idea that the 
conversion failure to anthocyanins is the source for the yellow pigment." Joel 
Rapp

NEWS AND BRIEFS: ELLIS ISLAND TO REOPEN AS GATEWAY TO OUR PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It took six years and cost $156 million, but Ellis Island in New York Harbor 
finally is ready to reopen to the public as America's National Museum of 
Immigration. 
</P>
<P>
After a week of official ceremonies and special events, the museum will be open 
starting Sept. 10. It can be reached by ferry from the Battery. Shuttle 
services are available to the Statue of Liberty daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Soviets Can't Lick This Problem: Moscow, which often boasts of having the 
world's best ice cream, has a shortage in these waning days of summer. 
</P>
<P>
Ice cream kiosks on street corners and in city parks have been displaying "no 
ice cream" signs, although they continue to sell souvenirs, marshmallows, 
chocolates and other candies. 
</P>
<P>
Ice cream is still available at foreign outlets, such as the Baskin-Robbins 
stores in the Rossia Hotel and on the Arbat pedestrian mall, or the 
Soviet-Swiss joint-venture Pinguin. 
</P>
<P>
But lines are long and prices are high for Muscovites who have always taken 
pride in their own ice cream, which they buy in paper-wrapped slabs or on 
sticks, rather than in cones. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the shortage has been caused by two of the three ice 
cream-making factories in Moscow being closed for repairs this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Anniversary: Israel's national museum celebrates its 25th anniversary 
Monday with the opening of the $11-million Nathan Cumings 20th-Century Art 
Building, the latest of more than 20 pavilions, galleries and gardens that 
bestride Jerusalem's Hill of Tranquility. 
</P>
<P>
The Israel Museum receives about one million visitors a year, with the famous 
Shrine of the Book housing the Dead Sea Scrolls being perhaps its most 
well-known exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Happy Valley Again: Hong Kong has succeeded in reversing the decline in tourism 
it suffered as a result of neighboring China's massacre of pro-democracy 
demonstrators in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures compiled in the British colony, tourism dropped 4% to 5.4 
million visitors last year. In the first four months of this year, however, 
there has been a 1% increase in the number of visitors compared to the same 
period a year ago, and overall growth is forecast to be 8% to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Climbing the Scaffold: After two years of repair and restoration, a 
16th-Century fresco by Correggio has reopened to the public in Parma, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The work, accomplished between 1520 and 1524, can be found in the dome of the 
abbey at San Giovanni Envangelista church. Until Sept. 30, groups of about 20 
visitors are being allowed to climb to the 100-foot-high dome on scaffolding to 
see the painting up close. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Reassurance: Egyptian tourism officials are going to great lengths to 
assure would-be visitors that they will be safe and that the situation in Egypt 
is stable despite the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the tension and current circumstances in the Middle East at present, 
Egypt is still enjoying a normal influx of tourists from all parts of the 
world, with the exception of the countries directly involved in the conflict," 
said Hamdi Saad El-Din, director of the Egyptian Tourist Authority. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it is extremely important to inform the public that the U.S. State 
Department has not issued any travel advisories warning citizens against 
traveling to Egypt." 
</P>
<P>
From Cowbell to Liberty Bell: Swissair has inaugurated daily direct service 
between Zurich and Philadelphia, bringing to nine the number of gateway cities 
in the United States served by the airline. 
</P>
<P>
Fees Take a Hike: As of Sept. 1, California's Department of Parks and 
Recreation has hiked the cost of campsites, day use, boat rentals and other 
services in the state parks system. 
</P>
<P>
Most fees will be increased by $2 and will place a greater portion of the cost 
of state park operation on park users rather than the taxpayers as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Fallout From Pompeii: Travelers headed to New York City in the next two weeks 
have the chance to combine it with a visit to Pompeii, if they feel so 
inclined. 
</P>
<P>
Care to see the skeleton of a woman clutching coins that bear the date AD 79 
(the year Pompeii was buried)? How about a video simulation of the eruption 
itself? Or a look at more than 200 objects unearthed at the doomed city within 
the past two years? 
</P>
<P>
They're all part of an exhibit at the Midtown IBM Gallery of Science and Art 
that runs through Sept. 15. The gallery, on Madison Avenue at 56th Street, is 
open Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is free.

TRACKING POLAR BEARS IN MANITOBA CAN GIVE ANYONE CASE OF COLD FEET

CHURCHILL, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was dawn in the frozen north. Sometime during the night, our train had edged 
out of Manitoba's prairie and into the first fringes of birch forest. Our guide 
was pointing out the twiggy mounds that are beaver lodges when we saw the old 
man. 
</P>
<P>
He was dressed in white long johns and leaning out the open window of a low, 
split-log cabin that sat in the middle of nowhere, in the woods. The scene was 
unreal, almost like a museum exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
But then, this whole trip didn't seem quite real. We were on Via Rail's "Hudson 
Bay," a train that was taking us first into the past, then to the edges of 
North America's last true frontier. 
</P>
<P>
We were on our way to the town of Churchill, Manitoba, 500 miles south of the 
Arctic Circle, to see polar bears. It was fall and it was cold. But first, 
there was the train. 
</P>
<P>
For 1,000 miles -- two nights and a day -- we traveled through an increasingly 
harsh landscape, past towns with names like Flin Flon Junction and Moose Nose 
Lake and Pukatawagan, finally getting to an area where there are no roads, 
where the rail line is the only highway in and out. 
</P>
<P>
Past Thompson and the last set of gravel ruts, we started picking up fur 
trappers. Alex Brightnose, 64, was a stocky, weathered Cree Indian with a wide, 
flat face and cauliflower ears. He looked the part and, indeed, has been 
trapping for 37 years . . . full-time since the Thompson nickel mines said he 
was too old for mining. 
</P>
<P>
Alex has 30 miles of trap lines and, in a good year, earns maybe $4,000. He 
gets beaver and mink mostly. They fetch $100 apiece. If he's really lucky, Alex 
gets a lynx, good for $700 if it's in top-notch shape. All this he does in a 
land where mid-winter temperatures can easily drop to 50 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
The train is a link to a past when railroads were vitally important 
transportation. Trappers such as Alex use it as we would use a car, hitching 
rides for groceries or to visit friends down the line. 
</P>
<P>
As for us, we rumbled on through the night. Right on time the next morning, we 
pulled into Churchill, a two-square-mile collection of plain stucco buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Churchill would be one more forgettable Manitoba town except for a couple of 
things. First, sitting on the mouth of the Churchill River at the edge of 
Hudson Bay, it's a major shipping port. 
</P>
<P>
Hard as it may be to picture looking at a map, Churchill is 1,000 miles closer 
to Europe than Montreal and 1,200 miles closer than Halifax. Thus, grain grown 
in the middle of Canada is shipped to Europe through here. 
</P>
<P>
But most important from the tourists' standpoint, Churchill is where you come 
to see polar bears. 
</P>
<P>
The bears are here because they've always been here. Each winter, they roam the 
ice on Hudson Bay in search of seals. Then as the ice melts, they're forced 
ashore and spend the summer lazing around. Come fall, they're restless and 
hungry. They head for the bay's coastline, anxiously prowling around and 
waiting for the bay to freeze up. Once that happens, they're gone. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny town of Churchill, population 800 in winter, just happens to be in the 
way of all this. As far back as the first European settlements in the 17th 
Century, people were writing home about the bears. 
</P>
<P>
And with good reason: A full-grown male bear, after a winter's gorging, can 
easily weigh 1,200 pounds. One huge beast was measured at nearly 1,800 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, even with all that weight, the average bear can run 35 m.p.h., and drag a 
200-pound seal from the water and kill it in seconds. He is also the perfect 
cold-weather machine. The hairs of his cream coat are actually hollow to better 
trap and transmit warmth to his black skin. He's well-padded with fat, and his 
foot-wide feet are carpeted with rough skin for traction on ice and with fur 
for walking in snow. 
</P>
<P>
So besides a ring of traps and warning signs throughout the town, there are 
other accommodations made for bears in Churchill. On Halloween, for instance, 
local firemen and Mounties patrol the streets to keep trick-or-treaters safe. 
</P>
<P>
What with this kind of care, it's been years since anyone was injured by a 
bear. The last was a local man who had been rummaging through a burned building 
at midnight and stuffed hamburger meat in his pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Most bear sightings, especially those by tourists, are made from the safety of 
a special tundra bus. And that's exactly what we were scheduled to do. 
</P>
<P>
We headed out in one of the original Tundra Buggies . . . a tall, boxy 
contraption on huge tires that looks like a bus on fat stilts. Each buggy holds 
28 people and has a toilet and a viewing platform. 
</P>
<P>
For half an hour, we bounced across the tundra. The land is absolutely flat, 
unrelieved except for pebbles and an occasional boulder. It looks, in fact, 
like an endless beach, though in this case it's an incredibly fragile one. 
</P>
<P>
Out here, where the wind-chill factor in winter can cause temperatures to reach 
the equivalent of 100 below, everything moves and grows slowly. Tiny 
evergreens, hardly four feet tall, are 500 years old. Willows stand barely two 
feet high. Berry bushes (with full-size berries) reach maybe six inches. 
</P>
<P>
This is why the buggies sit on such fat tires. The six-foot-high, 
four-foot-wide tractor tires have only five pounds of pressure per square inch, 
meaning they can roll over the tundra with less force than a person walking. 
</P>
<P>
For an hour or so, we saw bears in the distance -- bears playing on the 
horizon, bears by other buggies, but nothing near enough for us to take 
pictures. Then someone shouted, "Bear ahead!" 
</P>
<P>
The closer we got, the rangier he looked. We could see the skin hanging from 
his body. He plodded up to our companion buggy and sniffed the side, burying 
his head in a wheel well. 
</P>
<P>
Then the bear turned and came our way, shaking his head back and forth as if 
trying to figure us out. Finally he walked off, the sunlight still playing off 
his sides and the shadows accentuating the folds of his skin. We, too, went on 
heading farther east. 
</P>
<P>
Our goal that day was a 70-foot-high mound called Knight's Hill, really a 
drumlin, a pile of rock and sediment thrust up by glaciers as they ground their 
way through this area eons ago. 
</P>
<P>
Our brief stop at Knight's Hill was magnificent. We stood among the sprigs of 
willow and heather while the low northern sun made the rust-colored lichen 
glow. This was our only chance to actually get on the ground because from high 
on the hill, it was easy to see anything coming. Even so, the buggy drivers and 
guides walked the perimeter with rifles. 
</P>
<P>
On our way back, we briefly visited the tundra camp. From a distance, it looked 
like a Rube Goldberg affair -- a generator wagon in back, a boxy dormitory and 
viewing platform in the middle, a school bus made into a diner in front. The 
camp sleeps 16 and has become a gathering spot of sorts for bears. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, we were not disappointed that afternoon. Six bears lounged on the 
ground, some with heads resting on paws, two nuzzling each other and a couple 
more just sitting there. As we pulled up, one of the bears stood on his hind 
legs and stared while a half-dozen photographers on the viewing platform 
jostled for position. 
</P>
<P>
Then our own buggy exploded into action as windows popped open and 15 cameras 
clicked away. We had been hoping for one, maybe two bears this day. Our hopes 
were far exceeded.

WORLD TRAVEL WATCH: SOME MIDDLE EAST COUNTRIES CONSIDERED SAFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
World Travel Watch is a monthly report designed to help you make informed 
judgments about travel throughout the world. Because conditions can change 
overnight, always make your own inquiries before you leave home. In the United 
States, contact the nearest passport agency office; abroad, check in with the 
nearest American embassy. 
</P>
<P>
MIDDLE EAST 
</P>
<P>
Iraq/Kuwait: The State Department has issued an advisory to Americans to "defer 
all non-essential travel to the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, and to Qatar, 
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates . . . Note that this advisory applies only 
to the eastern province, not the rest of Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
While travel to Israel, Turkey and Egypt remains safe for the most part, the 
unpredictable nature of the current Persian Gulf crisis means the possibility 
of violence against Americans could increase if hostilities escalate -- or even 
if there's a stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
ASIA 
</P>
<P>
China: In an effort to boost tourism after last summer's massacre of student 
demonstrators, China's National Tourism Administration has created a 24-hour, 
7-day-a-week hotline, with English- and Japanese-speaking operators, to 
investigate complaints by tourists and to help resolve transportation and 
lodging problems. In Beijing, the number is (01) 513 0828; in Shanghai, dial 
(021) 439 0630. There are also numbers for Tianjin, Guilin and the following 
provinces: Jiangsu, Zhejian, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Gansu. 
</P>
<P>
India: There are many areas in this country considered "disturbed," protected 
or restricted that require special permission from the government to visit. 
Check with the Government of India Tourist Office, 3550 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 
204, Los Angeles 90010, (213) 380-8855, for details. For travel between India 
and Pakistan, the only official border crossing point for foreigners is at 
Attari, Punjab/Wakah, Pakistan, by train or road, any day of the week between 
9:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. A Pakistani visa is required. 
</P>
<P>
AFRICA 
</P>
<P>
Somalia: There have been a growing number of violent crimes, including bombings 
and shootings, in the capital of Mogadishu and environs. Other parts of the 
country are also unstable; avoid travel to Somalia at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Tanzania: While photography in game parks is unrestricted, travelers should be 
aware that elsewhere in the country, severe photo restrictions are enforced. 
Many places not clearly identified as off-limits for photographs -- hospitals, 
schools, bridges and harbors, for example -- can in fact be taboo. Be careful 
of not just what you shoot, but who is watching, even if it seems to be an 
innocent picture. 
</P>
<P>
Also, security officials don't always notify the U.S. Embassy of detention or 
arrest, so quick consular access to U.S. citizens can't be guaranteed.

EUROPE/SOVIET UNION 
</P>
<P>
France: As of Jan. 1, smoking will be forbidden on commuter trains, in the 
corridors on nonsmoking cars on long-distance trains, and on nonsmoking 
platforms. 
</P>
<P>
Romania: While the security situation has calmed down, it is wise to avoid 
travel alone at night, and to keep in touch with the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AMERICA 
</P>
<P>
Suriname: Travel continues to be dangerous outside the capital of Paramaribo 
and the western town of Neiuw Nickerie. Be careful when traveling outside these 
two urban centers, and on the road between Zanderij International Airport and 
Paramaribo, especially at night. Register with the U.S. Embassy in Paramaribo 
on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela: Robberies and violent crime are on the upswing, as are fears that 
this country may be in danger of a military coup if the ongoing economic crisis 
doesn't ease. 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA 
</P>
<P>
CARIBBEAN 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua: Roads throughout the country are in rough shape, and travelers in 
rural areas should check with local officials for current conditions. Visitors 
considering off-road travel, especially in the far north or the mountainous 
regions of central Nicaragua, should check with locals about unmarked mined 
areas remaining from the long years of Contra/Sandinista hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
Trinidad &amp; Tobago: The recent coup attempt and hostage crisis that 
paralyzed this small country and led to extensive looting in the capital city 
of Port of Spain is over. The government is in control throughout the country 
and tensions in Port of Spain have eased, but a 9 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew remains 
in effect. While conditions are improving, it's likely that the curfew will 
remain in effect until mid-September, and it may be even longer before normal 
airline and cruise ship schedules are resumed. Return flights may be hard to 
book at this time. Americans considering traveling here can contact the U.S. 
Embassy for the latest information -- 15 Queen's Park West, Port of Spain, 
telephone (809) 622-6372.

<P>
Canada: Air Canada introduces smoke-free flying Oct. 1 on all flights between 
Europe and North America. 
</P>

SOUTHEAST ASIA 
</P>
<P>
Myanmar (Burma): Tension is increasing around the country the longer the 
government drags its feet in turning over power to the opposition, which won a 
landslide vote in May, the first multiparty elections in three decades. Civil 
unrest is a growing possibility, and a 10 p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfew remains in 
effect in Rangoon. No individual tourist visas are being granted, and because 
of continuing safety problems with Myanmar Airways, travelers should avoid 
flying on the domestic carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Indonesia: There has been a rise in insurgent activity in the Aceh region of 
northwest Sumatra against government troops and settlers from crowded Java. 
Exercise caution. 
</P>
<P>
Philippines: Coup rumors are circulating once again in Manila, although this 
has been true almost since Corazon Aquino came to power in 1986. More important 
are threats against American officials by Communist rebels who have shown the 
ability to strike in urban as well as rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
These threats present little risk for travelers as long as they are not 
affiliated with any recognizable American organization, the armed forces or 
U.S. government, and they avoid places patronized by U.S. personnel. Most major 
tourist areas around the country have not been affected by unrest, and remain 
safe.

ENJOYING THE TRAIL THAT WAS A RAIL IN BERMUDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the 1930s and '40s, passengers on the Bermuda Railway were treated to 
breathtaking views of palmetto-fringed shores, picturesque hamlets and a 
profusion of subtropical plants and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The train is long gone, but the Bermudan government in 1984 converted the rails 
to trails. The result is the Bermuda Railway Trail, a 22-mile footpath that 
offers travelers an intimate look at the island. 
</P>
<P>
The Bermuda Railway did not have an easy time getting on track. By the time it 
opened in 1931, it already had two dubious achievements to its name: It was the 
most costly railway line ever built (more than 1 million), and its rate of 
construction -- 2 1/23 miles per year -- the slowest ever achieved. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the railway was a distinct improvement over the muddy roads and 
horse-drawn carriages. The line and rolling stock deteriorated after World War 
II, and the government sold it -- lock, stock and locomotive -- to British 
Guiana, now Guyana. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the former railway line is a wonderful walk. The grade, as you might 
expect, is easy. Oleander and hibiscus hedges line the trail, which at times 
gives walkers the feeling that they're stepping down a garden path. 
</P>
<P>
Countless subtropical flowers perfume the salt air. The islanders are extremely 
polite, helpful and particularly friendly to anyone exploring their island on 
foot. All of Bermuda -- cities, sights and beaches -- is within reach of the 
Railway Trail. 
</P>
<P>
Although the serious hiker could walk the whole 22-mile trail -- plus numerous 
side trails and byways -- in two days, sampling the path a few miles a day is 
the better way to go. 
</P>
<P>
Spend mornings walking to some of the island's scattered sights: the Aquarium, 
Botanical Garden, Royal Navy Dockyard, Lover's Lake Nature Preserve, plus the 
towns of Hamilton, Somerset and St. George. Use the warm afternoons to sunbathe 
or sightsee. 
</P>
<P>
Pick up a copy of "The Bermuda Railway Trail Guide" at the Bermuda Department 
of Tourism Office in the capital city of Hamilton. This brochure divides the 
trail into seven sections and has some excellent maps and descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Also helping you get on the trail is the island's excellent bus service. Buses 
are frequent and (usually) on time. Passengers always say "thank you" to the 
driver when disembarking. Almost every part of the Bermuda Railway Trail is 
within a short walk of a bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
The trail visits -- or travels near -- virtually every park and preserve on the 
island. You'll walk through small groves of native Bermuda cedar and fiddleneck 
woodland, as well as stands of allspice trees and Surinam cherry. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with an interest in subtropical botany will be delighted with a visit to 
the Bermuda Botanical Garden, which features a palm garden, hibiscus garden, 
fern collection and an aviary. 
</P>
<P>
The Bermuda Railway Trail is also a walk into the island's history. You'll 
visit St. George, the second English town to be established in the New World 
(Jamestown, Va., was the first). 
</P>
<P>
Another sight is Somerset Bridge, the smallest drawbridge in the world. Just 32 
inches wide, this hand-operated relic from 1620 still opens to allow the 
passage of a sailboat's mast. Just offshore from the trail is Gibbet Island, 
where witches once were burned at the stake. 
</P>
<P>
Intersecting the Bermuda Railway Trail are numerous dirt roads that the 
islanders call Tribe Roads. Tribe Road 2 goes to Gibbs Hill Light House, Tribe 
Road 4A to Elbow Beach. Other tribe roads lead to other adventures. 
</P>
<P>
Bermuda Railway Trail never wanders too far from food and drink. You can stop 
at the local grocery stores and buy items for a picnic, drop by an ice cream 
parlor or lunch at a seafood restaurant on conk fritters, fried abalone or fish 
with a ginger cream sauce. Wash it down with a British beer or fruity tropical 
concoction. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, to really get into the spirit of walking Bermuda, men should pay a 
visit to one of the fine clothiers in downtown Hamilton. Proper length for 
Bermuda shorts, which usually come in rather plain colors, is two to four 
inches above the knee. 
</P>
<P>
Local gentlemen wear them with knee socks, ties and jackets. Official Bermuda 
"short season" for the police force is May to November, but many men wear them 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Winter, for the dedicated walker anyway, might be a good time to hit the 
Railway Trail. Bermuda, about 600 miles east of North Carolina, is not a 
tropical island. It has hot summers, but only mild winters, when the water can 
be cold enough to keep people out. If getting a perfect tan is not your primary 
reason for visiting Bermuda, winter is a nice time to go. 
</P>
<P>
Bermuda Rendezvous Time, as they call it on the island, runs from mid-November 
to the end of March. Many special events are scheduled during the off-season. 
For the budget- conscious traveler, visiting at this time can result in 
substantial savings on accommodations. (Bermuda can be a very expensive 
island.) 
</P>
<P>
Hiking across Bermuda is definitely not for everyone, thank heaven. But for the 
adventurous, the bucolic Bermuda Railway Trail is a great experience.

THEY STILL COME TO THE REAL-LIFE FIELD OF DREAMS

<TEXT>
<P>
Just outside this little farming town in northeast Iowa lies a baseball field 
where dreams refuse to die. 
</P>
<P>
When Universal Studios took over Don Lansing's farm and turned it into a movie 
set for the 1989 hit film "Field of Dreams," it became the hottest tourist 
attraction in the history of Dubuque County. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Hollywood film crews are long gone and the farmers are back to 
growing corn. Still, like the movie says, the people will come. 
</P>
<P>
And come they do. An estimated 10,000 visitors will have made the pilgrimage 
before summer's out. 
</P>
<P>
"This field is really like a shrine," said Lansing, an amiable 47-year-old 
bachelor whose farm has been in the family for three generations. "It's 
amazing. There was an 80-year-old man out here the other day pitching to his 
grandson." 
</P>
<P>
Lansing presides benignly over it all, patiently answering visitors' questions 
and pointing out things like the heart that actor Kevin Costner carved in the 
first-base bleachers with the words "Ray loves Annie." (Costner played Ray 
Kinsella in the film, while Annie was the name of his wife, played by Amy 
Madigan.) 
</P>
<P>
Lansing admits that the movie "has pretty much changed my life," but he clearly 
enjoys his new-found celebrity status, not to mention the improvements the 
film's construction crew made on his farm. 
</P>
<P>
He motions to his house near first base. "They added the veranda and hung a 
swing there. They put in all new windows and hardwood floors, an open 
staircase, even central air conditioning. Not bad for a 9O-year-old farmhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lansing refuses to take advantage of his visitors. They can buy a "Field of 
Dreams" sweatshirt from has makeshift souvenir stand or drop a few quarters 
into the soft-drink machine. 
</P>
<P>
It took four months during the summer of 1988 to make the film. For Lansing, 
the highlight was the climactic scene in which 1,500 cars formed a three-mile 
procession from Dyersville to his farm. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone gathered at the park for hot dogs and potato chips," he said. "Then 
they all lined up at 4 o'clock and started out at dusk with their headlights 
on. It was spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to Lansing's farm are getting a slightly different view of the 
baseball field than they saw in the movie. A telephone line now stretches 
across third base to right center field. 
</P>
<P>
"Over there, that belongs to my neighbors, Al and Rita Ameskamp," said Lansing, 
pointing to left field. For now, the field is plowed under. Just behind third 
base, the Ameskamps have put up a mailbox that reads: "Keep left field alive." 
A slit in the top invites donations. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the backstop, Lansing has his own contributions box to help maintain the 
infield. "It's no big deal," he said. "Still, between the neighbors and me, 
we're losing about 3 1/2 acres of corn to keep this field." 
</P>
<P>
"So why not charge admission?" 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't think of it," Lansing says. "It was just an honor to have my farm 
selected. I'm not going to take it away from the people." 
</P>
<P>
A plastic bat and whiffleball lay between first base and the pitcher's mound. A 
teen-ager picked up the ball and called to his father, "Dad, let's play catch." 
</P>
<P>
Lansing smiled. "That's what this place is all about." 
</P>

Thank you for Max Jacobson's delightful "Bangkok Eateries" on July 29. As a 
totally incurable part-time expatriate and amateur explorer of places not in 
anybody's guidebook, I can usually find the writers who picked up their 
knowledge on a tour bus or on a see-the-world-in-14-days package. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are some absolutely exceptional writers such as Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
I was amazed by his ability to put so many aspects of the Thai experience into 
words. It's obvious he thoroughly understood the experiences he was sharing 
with us and enjoyed them. 
</P>
<P>
I hate to cause problems within your organization, but any way you could lure 
him away from your dining editor on a more regular basis? (And then turn him 
loose a few more places from, say, Beijing to Bali?) Fabulous article! Thank 
you.

UNITED NATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE FLYING HIGH, BUT REAL TEST IS TO COME; 
</P>
<P>
IRAQ: IF SADDAM HUSSEIN HOLDS ON TO KUWAIT AND POWER, WILL THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
VOTE TO USE OVERWHELMING FORCE TO ENFORCE ITS OWN RESOLUTIONS?

<TEXT>
<P>
The winds of war are swirling across the Arabian sands. If Iraq stands firm, 
endures the U.N. economic sanctions and takes no action to provoke a massive 
military response from U.S. or multinational forces, the enforcement of 
international law either will have to be ventured or forsaken. Since upholding 
international law closely parallels U.S. objectives in the Middle East, this 
will become the most critical decision ever to confront the U.N. Security 
Council in its 45-year history. 
</P>
<P>
International law has clearly triumphed since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait on 
Aug. 2. The Security Council approved, without dissent, five rapid-fire 
resolutions. Among the most important were the trade embargo of Iraq and the 
authorization to use appropriate force to make it stick. 
</P>
<P>
Never before, moreover, has international law so centrally underpinned U.S. 
intervention overseas. Almost daily, the Administration invokes it to condemn 
Hussein and justify its actions. Two of President Bush's four objectives in 
sending massive military forces to the Arabian Peninsula and adjacent waters 
mirror the Security Council's demands: the immediate, complete and 
unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the restoration of 
Kuwait's legitimate government. If there is anything international law stands 
for today, it is the illegality of aggression. 
</P>
<P>
The third U.S. objective -- security and stability of Saudi Arabia and the 
Persian Gulf -- rests heavily on the legal right of collective self-defense to 
aid Saudi Arabia and its neighbors. The future availability and price of oil 
has a lot to do with this U.S. goal, though the Administration no longer offers 
the oil dilemma, or "our way of life," as a legal rationale for the military 
deployment. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's fourth objective -- "the protection of American citizens abroad" -- is 
embodied in Security Council Resolution 663, which demands release of detained 
foreigners. It provides important legal support for any future military action 
Bush may deem necessary to rescue imperiled Americans in Kuwait or Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
A rescue mission could easily become the pretext for full-scale war against 
Iraq, of course. Such a campaign to enforce international law -- including the 
common objectives of the Security Council and the Administration to roll back 
the Iraqi army and restore Kuwaiti independence -- will require much more legal 
armor. 
</P>
<P>
For Bush, the ready, but inadequate, solution is simply to invoke collective 
self-defense as the legal basis for any military action. The President 
initially sought to justify the U.S.-led interdiction with this rationale, 
citing a written request from the legitimate government of Kuwait and the 
Administration's controversial interpretation of the Security Council's 
trade-sanctions resolution. 
</P>
<P>
This has been Bush's only international-law misstep so far. With the help of 
Thomas R. Pickering, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, he quickly regained 
his footing. If there were no United Nations, perhaps the inherent right of 
collective self-defense would suffice. But in this case, self-defense 
principles operate in anything but a vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. collective-security train, despite its near-powerless heritage, left 
the station early in August at high speed. Once on track, the Security 
Council's enforcement power -- especially when it works -- can eclipse the 
"inherent" right of collective self-defense found in Article 51 of the U.N. 
Charter. 
</P>
<P>
Patience, though, may be required. The United States has no international legal 
authority to respond with knee-jerk loyalty to every request lodged by Kuwaiti 
or Saudi authorities, no matter how extreme, simply by claiming: "Under Article 
51, we can fire on Iraqi ships, retake Kuwait and bomb Baghdad so long as 
Kuwati or Saudi officials ask us to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Pickering had little choice but to return to the well of the Security Council 
to get authority to use military force in the name of the United Nations. 
Although it took time to sway the Soviets and the Chinese, he succeeded Aug. 
25, when the Security Council approved a carefully worded resolution 
authorizing measures to enforce the trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is far more difficult, but necessary. When the breaking point 
approaches, the United States must be certain that forces of other nations join 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops in fighting a war with Iraq. Pickering will have to be prepared to 
return to the Security Council and seek full authority under Article 42, 
Chapter VII, of the U.N. Charter to enforce international law with speed and 
overwhelming force. Article 42 enables the Security Council to use armed force 
"to maintain or restore international peace and security" in the event other 
means, like the trade sanctions, prove inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
The great advantage of acting under this article is that the United States and 
its multinational partners would be released from the constraints of collective 
self-defense -- such as proportionality, necessity, immediacy and the victim 
state's request. The Security Council would authorize enforcement of the 
resolutions of August with whatever it takes to wage a successful offensive war 
against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The other critical advantage will be the Soviet Union's willingness, already 
implied, to join a multinational army operating under the U.N. flag. West 
Germany and Japan, whose constitutions prohibit direct military intervention 
overseas, would also be much better positioned to contribute to a U.N. military 
campaign because of their obligations under the U.N. Charter. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics will argue that Chapter VII requires negotiations of cumbersome 
"special agreements" between the Security Council and participating governments 
to make their armed forces available to the United Nations. There is also 
concern, especially at the Pentagon, about any U.N.-coordinated command 
superseding a government's control over its armed forces in the field and on 
the seas. 
</P>
<P>
These hurdles are manageable. Article 42 can stand on its own without any 
special agreements. They have become anachronistic, anyway. The agreements were 
intended to ensure that the Security Council had forces at its disposal. In 
this case, the multinational army already exists. In 1950, the Security Council 
authorized countries to provide military forces to assist in the defense of 
South Korea despite the absence of special agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Military Staff Committee already has been energized to help coordinate 
the trade embargo of Iraq. But each participating navy remains under national 
command and bound by its own rules of engagement. In the long run, it may not 
be such a bad idea to create a U.N. command umbrella, however porous, to 
coordinate armies gathering on the Saudi desert. Without the United Nations, 
can the United States be so certain that the Egyptians, Syrians, Pakistanis, 
Saudis and even European allies will follow U.S. troops north into Kuwait and, 
if necessary, into Iraq if war breaks out? There is enough flexibility in the 
U.N. Charter, enough U.S. troops on the ground and certainly a key precedent 
from the Korean action to negotiate a U.S.-dominated command structure. 
</P>

The failure to build a solid legal foundation could haunt the United States and 
its friends if, and when, the decision is made to go on the offensive against 
Baghdad to achieve Bush's four objectives. Without the powerful legal arsenal 
that a resurgent Security Council can authorize to enforce international law, 
the United States may end up fighting Saddam Hussein alone.

FELICIA MARCUS; 
</P>
<P>
FIGHTING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT FROM INSIDE THE ESTABLISHMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jane Fritsch, Jane Fritsch is City Hall reporter for The Times. She 
interviewed the Felicia Marcus on a rare Sunday afternoon when the commissioner 
was able to take time off from work. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Felicia Marcus went off to Harvard to major in East Asian studies, the 
echoes of 1960s activism had grown faint. It was the pre-yuppie mid-1970s, an 
unsettling time for young people who witnessed the passion of the Vietnam 
generation but arrived at adulthood too late to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus, now 34, followed an Establishment path: Harvard, Capitol Hill, New York 
University Law School. But she has emerged in recent years with a brand of 
activism that has taken her from the inside to the outside and back again. 
</P>
<P>
Her agenda is the environment and she has spent most of her adult life on the 
outside, agitating for solutions to a range of air and water pollution 
problems, nudging bureaucracies through press conferences and lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Marcus is back inside again. Appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley to the 
Environmental Quality Board 18 months ago, Marcus was plucked from the 
leadership of the environmental movement in a move intended to quell rising 
criticism that the board lacked commitment to environmental concerns. Last 
summer, Bradley appointed her to the Board of Public Works, the panel that 
oversees city construction as well as the sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
Her resume made her both an impeccable and improbable choice. Marcus, who 
earned a degree in environmental law, was a founder of Heal the Bay, the 
organization credited with pressuring the city of Los Angeles to develop a plan 
to end the dumping of raw sewage into Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
She lived in the San Fernando Valley before going east to attend Harvard. 
Later, a job in the Washington office of Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los 
Angeles), gave her a chance to work on environmental issues. In 1983, after 
graduating from NYU, she returned to Los Angeles and worked as a clerk for a 
federal judge and an attorney for the firm of Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson. 
</P>
<P>
Well-spoken and sometimes eloquent, Marcus becomes almost tongue-tied when she 
is asked what she has been reading lately. With some embarrassment, she 
concedes that thick volumes on sewage systems and construction projects can 
usually be found on her night stand. A resident of Venice, she acknowledges 
that she rarely gets to the beach and repeats a pledge to her friends that she 
will take a weekend off, soon. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Was there a point where you realized you were being taken seriously, 
that Heal the Bay had arrived or the environmental movement had arrived? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It's hard to pinpoint when it happened. I think we were taken 
seriously at the beginning because we had done our homework and were filing 
legal papers in the administrative proceeding that were pretty compelling. And 
we had the facts and the law on our side. But something happened at some point 
where different people arrived at City Hall. . . . The city had been trying 
since 1980 to not have to fully treat its sewage. Ruth Galanter was elected to 
the city council, an environmental proposition passed, the environmental 
movement started to become an issue. . . . We developed relationships over time 
through the battles with different people at City Hall and people realized that 
we were very serious, but also very hard-working and that our objectives were 
really just to clean up the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But this movement didn't attract a lot of dilettantes? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, not too many. The core group has remained fairly stable, with new people 
coming in over time. . . . I think there have been times when certain members 
would have preferred to keep doing press conferences and dumping buckets of 
sludge in public rather than sitting down and negotiating, but the consensus 
was that if you can accomplish things by negotiating, it's better to do that 
because it's much more effective. You can get far more that way. Recognizing 
your friends is really an important thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You've gone basically from the mainstream -- Harvard and Capitol Hill -- to 
the fringe of the environmental movement and then back to the center again at 
City Hall. Are you comfortable where you are now? 
</P>
<P>
A: Oh, I am. It's interesting, people ask me sometimes about that. I feel I've 
been totally consistent throughout in terms of my approach, in terms of trying 
to be helpful and get people to talk to each other and to focus. Certainly 
being a public-interest litigator and litigating against government, primarily, 
for all of my legal career, would seem to be fringe, but actually I've been 
blessed with clients who were really constructive clients. In this case, coming 
inside, I'm doing the same thing I was doing as a volunteer on the outside, 
except that I'm doing it full time on the inside. . . . (I) just try to find 
ways to make the process more responsive to environmental concerns and more 
sensible. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Your position on the Board of Public Works involves overseeing a lot of 
mundane kinds of matters, construction contracts and things you might not have 
been interested in before. Are you making the best use of your time? 
</P>
<P>
A: Actually, I love it. It's fascinating. It's not anything that I had 
anticipated, but I've always been interested in how things work and in making 
them work better. And the things that seem mundane, whether it's potholes or 
street lights, are things that are of tremendous importance to people and 
they're what make this city function as an organism. . . . Working on making 
that work more smoothly is just as interesting as making the sewage system work 
more smoothly or the sanitation system work. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But is if fulfilling? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yeah. I think so, because I also have the opportunity to really deal with 
people individually in that part of the job, with their individual concerns, 
and in some ways the solutions to their problems are things that I can 
accomplish in the short term. Whereas trying to overhaul the entire waste-water 
system or take a sanitation system that has for the last 
God-knows-how-many-years simply landfilled its trash and try and bring it into 
an era of recycling and waste reduction -- a totally different way of doing 
things -- is a much more long-term objective. So it's satisfying because I can 
get a pothole filled. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Your predecessor on the Board of Public Works was openly critical of the 
Bradley Administration's environmental record. You've been more circumspect. Do 
you agree with that and, if so, has that hurt your standing among 
environmentalists? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think I was as critical of City Hall as anyone in the preceding years, and 
I think my focus has been on City Hall as a whole, including both the mayor and 
the council. But I also . . . didn't hesitate to work with them because the 
objective is to accomplish things. . . . But it certainly hasn't hurt me. I was 
a vocal critic beforehand and I think that was part of the reason why they 
appreciated the fact that I was willing to work with them when they were 
willing to work with us. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you foresee a time when you might be a vocal critic again? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well sure, of course, if the need arises I'll be there. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When did you sense a turnaround at City Hall as far as environmental issues? 
</P>
<P>
 A: At the same time . . . when Heal the Bay began to be taken seriously. I 
think it probably started somewhere in -- I want to say '86 -- after we won on 
the waiver application and after Ruth (Galanter) was elected to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Would you say that applies to the country in general or just California? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think the country in general. I never dreamed that things could turn 
around so quickly. I think from my experience and my work, Los Angeles started 
turning around sooner, but that may just be because I was focused on issues in 
Los Angeles for the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there any way that George Bush can legitimately claim to be the 
environmental President? 
</P>
<P>
A: If he really does something, yeah. Right now he is not the environmental 
President. He is the "I'm better than the last President on the environment" 
President. It would be very, very difficult to be worse than the preceding 
President. . . . He has no right to claim to be an environmentalist just 
because he likes to fish. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you have a sense about what's happening in the rest of the country, what 
the public mood is about environmental issues. Are we way out ahead of it here? 
Are we ahead of the national sense about the environment? 
</P>
<P>
A: We always have been in California. California environmental regulations on 
everything, whether it's air, water or solid waste, have been and continue to 
be very advanced compared with the rest of the country. If you talk to public 
officials or activists from other major cities in the country, they think we're 
Disneyland compared to their cities with their problems. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Yet we still have the worst air in the country. 
</P>
<P>
A: We still have the worst air in the country despite having the most strict 
controls in the country and a lot of that has to do with the natural inversion 
layer. We're dealing with an almost impossible situation. . . . That's true not 
just in terms of air. We are not in a spot that's suited to easy environmental 
solutions. We import all our water, we import all of our energy. We are in this 
basin that doesn't allow any of the pollutants in the air to blow away and 
disperse like they do in other areas, so that we have much greater challenges 
in terms of dealing with our problems, but that's good, because then we can be 
trendsetters. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can we really improve our environment without drastically curtailing growth? 
There are projections of a million more people here in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
A: Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How? 
</P>
<P>
A: By managing the growth that we do have. We've operated in the last 30 or 40 
years on the assumption that we had unlimited resources and unlimited space. So 
the city developed in the most inefficient possible manner with everything 
totally spread out so that we have thousands of miles of sewer lines to service 
the number of people that could be serviced with a smaller number if we had a 
denser urban form. Cars have to drive farther. . . . 
</P>
<P>
We waste so much in terms of how we transport ourselves . . . in terms of trash 
and water. . . . We use everything once and then we throw it away. We use water 
once even though its imported from hundreds and hundreds of miles away into a 
desert area, we use it once and then we flush it down the toilet and into the 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there a city we can learn from? 
</P>
<P>
A: A lot of people look to Seattle as one possible example. They are pretty 
advanced in recycling and waste reduction. Their citizens have gotten their 
daily trash or their weekly trash disposal down from four 30-gallon cans, like 
we average now, down to one 15-gallon can in some areas just by thinking about 
what they purchase and recycling as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you motivate people to separate their trash when they know that it's 
all being dumped back together in the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Actually it's not, necessarily. There are going to be isolated instances 
where that happens and where we have to follow up on it, but I think it's 
unfortunate that that perception was created. I mean we have to be aggressive 
in creating the markets so that doesn't happen, but there are ways to stockpile 
your recyclables until the market picks up and we obviously have to be looking 
at that as well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There was a misperception on the part of politicians as to what people really 
would do. And I think it was a very patronizing attitude which said that people 
are too selfish to recycle unless there's something in it for them. I don't 
think that's true. . . . I don't think people want to necessarily be as 
wasteful as they are, but we have to give them the vehicles for leading a less 
wasteful life. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is this a Brentwood issue, though? Is it an issue that people care about in 
South Los Angeles or have the time to think about? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think my experience has been that the most active environmentalists in 
town are not necessarily in West Los Angeles. Some of the best environmental 
organizers in this city are in East Los Angeles and South-Central and they're 
groups that organized, perhaps initially, to fight a particular project or 
facility in their neighborhood, but that have continued to be a force for 
positive and more sensible environmental programs like recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does Hollywood help the movement or hurt it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Having celebrities at environmental events is something a lot of folks in 
the environmental community have mixed feelings about. I think on balance it's 
a good thing because one then gets media coverage of the substantive issues. . 
. . Organizers I've talked to who've tried to get the media, and particularly 
the TV media, to events are always asked, 'Will you have celebrities there?' 
and if one doesn't have celebrities there, they won't come. Q: Where will the 
environmental movement be in 10 years and in 25 years? Will it be a mainstream 
movement or will it have come and gone? 
</P>
<P>
A: I can't predict that. I have to be an optimist because I think the objective 
has got to be that the environmental movement is no longer necessary because it 
. . . will become integrated in just the way we do things. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Where will you be in five years and 10 years? At the center of things or 
back outside? 
</P>
<P>
A: I haven't the faintest idea. . . . I still would have thought it was 
unbelievable that I would be on the Board of Public Works a few years ago when 
we started this mess. I mean, this is really astonishing. But I think I'll be, 
hopefully, some place interesting and being useful and helpful. Right now I can 
be most useful and helpful on the inside because there's so much receptivity. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The only problem I have in my job is that there aren't enough hours in the day 
to do all the things that there are to be done, and if that changes, then being 
on the outside will be the better place to be, and I'll be on the outside. So, 
hopefully, in the thick of things, wherever that is.

A NATIONAL PARK AS PROFITABLE RESORT: EXPLOITING NATURE FOR ECONOMIC GAIN; 
</P>
<P>
YOSEMITE: A NEW BOOK TAKES A CRITICAL LOOK AT THE AGE-OLD AND CONTINUING FIGHT 
BETWEEN PRESERVATIONISTS AND DEVELOPERS IN A MAGNIFICENT SIERRA SETTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alfred Runte, Alfred Runte, the author of Yosemite: The Embattled Wilderness 
(University of Nebraska Press), from which this is adapted, is an environmental 
historian based in Seattle. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any resource open to everyone is eventually destroyed. So in 1968 Garrett 
Hardin, a professor of human ecology at the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, addressed thefutility of pleading for voluntary self-restraint to 
protect the environment. Such appeals, he noted, impress those individuals with 
a real sense of social responsibility but fail to sway anyone intent on 
maximizing personal gain. The result is the tragedy of the commons, the 
inevitable overexploitation of collectively held resources in the relentless 
pursuit of economic self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
Extending that thesis to Yosemite, Hardin argued that perhaps access should be 
denied to anyone unwilling to walk the prerequisite distance for ensuring that 
the park would not be overused or overdeveloped. Although labeled as elitist, 
the idea did have broad appeal, especially among preservationists, who 
considered resource conservation to be the only legitimate purpose of national 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Development in any form was therefore illegitimate, if only for the reason that 
structures, roads and everyday services were commonplace throughout America, 
whereas Yosemite was one of a kind. There had evolved, in either case, the 
unwritten standard that whatever Americans could do elsewhere in the country 
should not become common practice in national parks. 
</P>
<P>
Once more the issue hinged on the fundamental duality in park legislation, 
legal sanctions that provided, in effect, that Yosemite be managed for both 
private profit and resource conservation. Self-interest and the public interest 
(however defined) went hand in hand. But was coexistence realistic? 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the behavior of park concessionaires especially had suggested the 
many possibilities for serious contradictions. Regulated or not, 
concessionaires as a group had put profit ahead of preservation. As 
businessmen, they sought expansion, not only of facilities but also of saleable 
visitor services. Amusements were labeled "needs" and not merely luxuries. More 
often than not the subterfuge worked, allowing concessionaires to distance 
themselves from their own intensive campaigns for increased park development. 
</P>
<P>
The hostility of preservationists was all the more reason not to label the 
profit motive for what it was but instead, feigning concern for the 
environment, to plead again that meeting the demands of expansion was done only 
with considerable reluctance and, to re-emphasize, at the insistence of the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
If any single commodity ever sold in Yosemite cast doubt on the sincerity of 
that argument, most certainly that commodity was alcohol. Hardly had the first 
tourists begun arriving in the valley when tent saloons started popping up 
alongside popular overlooks and trails. 
</P>
<P>
National Prohibition, imposed in 1919 by the 18th Amendment to the 
Constitution, effectively sealed the debate for the next decade and a half. 
With the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, there was an opportunity to review, at 
the very least, the advisability of resuming the sale of alcoholic beverages in 
public parks and refuges. Yet the question had hardly been asked when the ban 
on sales was lifted. Although obviously pleased, concessionaires once more 
found it expedient to hide their support behind the standard words of 
subterfuge, insisting again that public demand was the chief source of 
persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
It remained for Donald B. Tresidder, the president of Yosemite Park &amp; Curry 
Co., to lift that legerdemain to new heights in a lengthy memorandum dated June 
20, 1934. "We wish to state emphatically," he began, "that this company is not 
going into the liquor business with the intention of developing a trade that 
will be as profitable as possible." The remainder of his two-page document 
continually underscored that promise, indicating that although Prohibition in 
national parks had just been repealed, his company intended to forbid anything 
suggestive of promoting alcohol consumption. To the contrary, the sale of 
alcoholic beverages would be kept strictly low-key and tastefully conservative. 
</P>
<P>
As of 1988 there were 35 outlets in Yosemite National Park selling beer, wine 
or liquor, 23 of those outlets on the valley floor alone. Yosemite Park &amp; 
Curry Co. further promoted sales through modern bars, expansive shelf displays 
and various types of advertising, including using company-operated buses and 
tours to point out the location of lounge facilities. Quite obviously, sometime 
in the 50 years following Tresidder's memo, his promise had been completely 
scuttled. 
</P>
<P>
For those in the postwar era who considered visitation itself a threat to 
Yosemite's scenic and biological resources, the park's first moment of truth 
came on Dec. 31, 1954, when total visitation for the preceding calendar year 
stood at 1,008,031 people. It was but a few months short of a century since 
James Mason Hutchings had brought the first party of tourists to Yosemite 
Valley in 1855. Yet just 13 years later, in 1967, the figure stood at 2 million 
and was rapidly climbing. Only 20 more years were needed to top 3 million 
visitors annually; the estimate in 1987 was more than 3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The lingering reaction among preservationists was one of vindication mixed with 
deep regret. Protection's first outspoken prophet, Frederick Law Olmsted, had 
predicted, in 1865, precisely the future that Yosemite was now experiencing. 
Ansel Adams added to Olmsted's interpretation. "When there was a vast reservoir 
of wilderness," he wrote to David Brower, "when areas such as Yosemite were 
difficult of access, there was a different kind of visitor; he came primarily 
for the experience of the place" and, even more significant, "was willing to 
sacrifice certain comforts and undergo considerable difficulties to gain this 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly development in Yosemite National Park attracted every kind of 
individual, not just people resigned to discomfort in the best interest of 
preservation. So-called services had also become "more general" as the 
character of visitors had changed. Among those "services" were more and more 
"entertainments" intended by park operators "to cover a wide and often 
unjustified range" of public whims and desires. The result, Adams concluded, 
was "a 'resort' enterprise to which people are attracted for other reasons than 
the simple experience of the natural scene." 
</P>
<P>
What 1 million visitors foretold for Yosemite was the difficulty of 
substituting logic for historical self-interest. To be sure, Ansel Adams 
himself was part of the complex entanglement that affected every rationale for 
resisting decisive changes in the park's management or infrastructure. Simply, 
tradition was not that easy to erase. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be guilty of a contradiction of my own principles," he finally 
confessed, "in continuing to support the Christmas Bracebridge Dinner at the 
Ahwahnee Hotel." Writing years later in his autobiography, he still had no 
illusions that the event had not originated in pursuit of the profit motive. 
</P>
<P>
"The winter season was always slow for the concessionaires; tourists were 
almost non-existent. To increase visitation Don Tresidder . . . began a program 
of winter sports." In 1927 Tresidder further "suggested a theatrical Christmas 
dinner at the Ahwahnee as a key focus for family winter vacations." Two years 
later he asked Adams to direct the entire affair, with the help of an 
architect, Jeannette Spencer. Adams agreed, "provided we could make it 
professional in concept and performance." The result was a Yuletide pageant, 
"an account of an English squire's Christmas entertainment," modeled after 
Washington Irving's "Christmas at Bracebridge Hall." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, no importation into Yosemite Valley could have been more foreign or 
artificial. The point was that this particular display of artificiality was 
Ansel Adams' own. "I plead guilty to this," he further confessed to David 
Brower. He nonetheless still excused himself. "Elements of art can be logically 
associated with the elements of the Natural experience -- both concern the 
spirit and the emotions." 
</P>
<P>
Here was the critic himself making a case for his opponents, arguing that not 
all development was necessarily intrusive or inappropriate. "As long as the 
Ahwahnee exists," he wrote, further conceding that point, "it offers the 
opportunity to express certain events of a definite spiritual character." Put 
another way, without the Ahwahnee there would be no special meaning to the 
Bracebridge Dinner, no grand stage on which Adams' proud creation could be 
played out to the fullest. The Ahwahnee "also, unfortunately, supports 
evidences of advanced urbanism which create a dichotomy in the Yosemite scene," 
Adams immediately added, still obviously wrestling with his original concern. 
</P>
<P>
In microcosm, the emotional tug-of-war of such a dedicated and outspoken 
preservationist was very telling evidence of the power of inconsistency. Faced 
with the thought of losing a Yosemite tradition so dear to his heart, Ansel 
Adams too was forced into rationalizing why he had diminished his lifetime 
scale of values. That very lapse in fortitude was precisely what Frederick Law 
Olmsted had had in mind when he wrote in 1865 of the need to adopt strict rules 
of conduct that would, without compromise, govern every park visitor. Ever 
since Olmsted, the search for those proper rules of conduct had been Yosemite's 
historic and endlessly debated challenge. Finally affected by the presence of 
Olmsted's predicted "millions," that search had indeed become all the more 
difficult. Ansel Adams was just another example of the futility of asking for 
commitment without effective coercion. 
</P>
<P>
Olsmsted's admonishment was to treat everything as impositions, unless 
something had originally been part of the natural scene. Otherwise the danger 
arose of accepting development itself as natural, further imposing layer upon 
layer of artificiality over the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett Hardin said it differently, but his conclusion was much the same. The 
acceptance of change need not be total; it need simply be present. The only way 
out of the tragedy of the commons was universal coercion. Everyone must accept 
the same standard, or the standard would fall.

Many blacks in this country, the argument goes, can't get good jobs because 
they drop out of high school. Those who go to college, receive an education and 
take advantage of affirmative-action policies, continues the argument, have a 
better than even chance of hitting the upper-income brackets. 
</P>
<P>
This view is still true, but to a much lesser extent than it was a decade ago. 
A new study, conducted for the Ford Foundation and the Rural Economic Policy 
Program of the Aspen Institute by me and Lucy Gorham, shows that since the late 
1970s there has been a dramatic deterioration in the earnings of working 
African-Americans -- even for those with college decrees. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan legacy amounts to nothing less than the economic polarization of 
America. The rich got richer. The poor got poorer. And the hard-working middle 
class became more insecure than at any time since before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
But people of color suffered most of all. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, one of three black workers in the United States earned poverty-level 
wages. By 1987, four of 10 were making that (inflation adjusted) wage -- 
roughly $12,000 for a family of four. During the same period, the share of 
African-American workers with earnings three times the poverty line fell, from 
7.2% to 5.6%. Thus, the frequently mentioned increase in middle-class black 
employees who no longer need equal-opportunity protection is a myth. 
</P>
<P>
The lot of African-American college graduates has deteriorated as well. The 
number of well-educated black men receiving below-the-poverty-line wages grew 
faster than those earning more than $36,000, the study's high-earnings 
benchmark. On balance, the share of African-American male college graduates 
with wages higher than $36,000 has fallensince 1979, from nearly 1 in 4 to 
fewer than 1 in 5. 
</P>
<P>
For college-educated black women, the 1980s were worse. Between 1979 and 1987, 
the number earning more than three times the poverty line declined by 10,000. 
This despite a net addition to the American labor pool of 407,000 black women 
with at least four years of college. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the situation for young black men was disastrous. Consider 
that of 25- to 34-year-olds, who might be expected to have settled down and 
begun a career. During the interval studied, the number of such men working but 
earning less than poverty wages increased by 161%. Put another way, the size of 
this group doubled during the 1980s, while the fraction earning more than three 
times the poverty line fell by half. And these statistics don't include those 
who dropped out of the active labor force. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are abundant. The devastation of many of the nation's basic 
manufacturing sectors -- steel, auto, etc. -- during the early 1980s hit black 
men especially hard. These industries produced jobs that offered a good living 
without the need for fancy educational credentials. The military had been 
another sure path to higher wages for people of color. But the new high-tech 
armed forces drastically increased entrance requirements, resulting in an 
immediate decline in the number and percentage of black recruits. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks in the creation of good government jobs have also fallen 
especially hard on Americans of color. Since World War II, civilian government 
employment had consistently been a promoter of upward income mobility for 
blacks (and for white women). In the 1980s, the public sector either reduced 
hiring altogether, or shifted from hiring permanent employees (with 
civil-service protection) to recruiting people into part-time or temporary 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a series of administrative and U.S. Supreme Court decisions during the 
decade has made it increasingly difficult for the victims of racial and gender 
discrimination to seek -- let alone achieve -- justice effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Affirmative action, ironically, is more important than ever when the number of 
"good jobs at good wages" being created in the American economy declines, while 
the low-wage work accompanying deindustrialization and corporate restructuring 
grows. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative efforts, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1990, would make it easier 
for workers of color who are discriminated against in hiring, promotions and 
wages to win lawsuits aimed at getting the incomes they have fairly earned. 
Both houses of Congress passed the bill early last month, and the President 
ought to sign it immediately. 
</P>
<P>
As African-American and other minority groups work harder to educate themselves 
and to enter the labor force, competition for the good jobs can only intensify. 
The anemic rates of national economic growth that most experts predict for the 
foreseeable future (and that are actually favored by an inflation-conscious 
Federal Reserve Bank and Wall Street) guarantee that the pressure is unlikely 
to be relieved any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
The deterioration in the earnings opportunities for black Americans who do work 
for a living is an unconscionable legacy of the politics and economics of the 
1980s. It needs to be better understood. But most of all, it needs to be 
stopped.

NEGOTIATIONS TO SETTLE MIDEAST CRISIS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration's position is that there can be no negotiations with 
Iraq until the Iraqi army withdraws from Kuwait. Unfortunately, even an 
unconditional withdrawal, while humiliating, would not address the real 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
As long as Iraq maintains a huge army, the U.S. presence in the Middle East is 
mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
The real answer to the current problem is disarmament. One way to disarm is 
with a hot war that destroys the Iraqi military machine, but perhaps this goal 
can be achieved without a hot war. 
</P>
<P>
We should agree to negotiate with Iraq while the armies hold their current 
positions. Our initial position should be that the U.S. will withdraw its 
forces if Iraq withdraws its troops from Kuwait, leaving its weapons behind; 
better yet, destroy them. Iraq's standing army must be reduced to a level 
required for defensive purposes only, and facilities for producing chemical and 
nuclear weapons must be dismantled. Iraq should be made to promise not to 
invade any of its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are Saddam Hussein will not accept this sincere offer, but you couldn't 
accuse us of refusing to negotiate. It also puts a proposal before the world 
that expresses our sincere desire for peace.

With respect to your article concerning Arab-American reaction to the crisis 
(Part B, Aug. 25): 
</P>
<P>
I know that many immigrants have come to America after having suffered greatly 
and that they desire the peace, freedom and security that our country has to 
offer. I welcome these people with all my heart. 
</P>
<P>
However, I believe I speak for many Americans when I say that any immigrant who 
supports Hussein in his confrontation with the U.S. deserves to be deported. 
More personally, I find it extremely offensive and inhumane that anyone would 
complain of American soldiers eating bacon in the Arabian desert, and not 
complain of the detention of thousands of Westerners in Iraq by the genocidal 
Hussein dictatorship. What would happen if our hostages complained of Hussein's 
policy in Iraqi newspapers?

After the Vietnam War, our government decided that it was not politically 
expedient to have American soldiers fight wars on foreign soil. 
</P>
<P>
So for the next 20 years when we wanted to "protect our interest abroad," we 
just armed "freedom fighters." We would pay the tab, sell them the military 
hardware, but let some poor Third World country provide the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as we move into the '90s, we are supplying the bodies and other countries 
are paying the tab. What does this mean in the "new world order"? The same old 
story, different perspective. Money talks, debtor nations' foot soldiers walk.

dissipated, history may reveal that the world has taken a step forward toward 
the U.N. dream of peace and security.

It is also worth noting that our ambassador at the U.N. is a proven diplomat. 
On occasions, we have named distinguished citizens to that post who had limited

You ask in your editorial "Who Made Iraq What It Is Today?" (Aug. 25). You need 
look no further than Israel, with its expansionist policy, backed with nuclear 
capability, and an American Congress whose motto is "Israel, right or wrong." 
</P>
<P>
This is what has made Iraq (and other Arab countries as well) into paranoid 
entities of distrust and fear, unable to distinguish between rational and 
irrational behaviors.

FOUR TINY IRRITANTS TO BETTER RELATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
TIME FOR MOSCOW TO GIVE ITURUP, KUNASHIR, SHIKOTAN AND HABOMAI TO JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new test in post-Cold War diplomacy is about to engage Moscow and Tokyo as 
they attempt to settle their 45-year territorial dispute over four tiny islands 
in the Kuril chain. 
</P>
<P>
In all that time, Japan has properly pressed its historical claim to the 
islands, which were seized by the Soviets toward the end of World War II. It's 
time for Moscow to give up Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Habomai, located off 
Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido and known as the Northern Territories 
in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
A settlement would clear the way for a long overdue peace treaty between Moscow 
and Tokyo. In fact, the phrase giving up probably gives the wrong impression, 
because ending their historically hostile relation-ship may be the only hope 
for Moscow to get access to much needed Japanese capital and technology. 
</P>
<P>
So when Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze meets with his Japanese 
counterpart Taro Nakayama this week, they should include a proposal to discuss 
the Kuril dispute as part of an agenda for Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's spring 1991 visit to Tokyo. It will be a historic first trip to 
Japan by a Soviet head of state. Japan is the only major industrialized country 
that Gorbachev has not visited in his attempt to bolster Soviet relations with 
the West and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
The disputed islands have little political -- and a debatable strategic -- 
significance to the Soviets. Indeed, they may be more important today as 
bargaining chips to securing economic development and trade for Soviet Asia. A 
Pravda commentator has already recommended transferring the islands into a 
joint special economic zone under the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has made settlement a condition to 
providing economic aid. But even though six other major industrialized 
countries supported Japan's claim to the islands in July, Tokyo must be careful 
not to erode its just claim to the islands with an offensively obvious brand of 
checkbook diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that a sensible resolution would irritate unyielding political groups 
in both countries. But that should not prevent the forging of a new era in 
Soviet-Japanese relations.

VONNEGUT IN PRISON AND AWAITING TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
HOCUS POCUS BY KURT VONNEGUT (G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS: $19.95; 304 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Irving, Irving's most recent novel, his seventh, is A Prayer for Owen 
Meany. He has just completed a screenplay of his sixth novel, The Cider House 
Rules, and an original screenplay, Son of the Circus. He is at work on his 
eighth novel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The novel is the highest example of subtle interrelatedness that man has 
discovered. -- D. H. Lawrence 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Vonnegut is a friend of mine. He was my teacher at the University of Iowa; 
he is my neighbor in Sagaponack, Long Island -- it is a three-minute bike ride 
from my house to his. When I moved into my house, he gave me several plants -- 
shrubs, actually; blue hydrangea and purple lilac. They are doing very well, 
largely because he told me how to care for them. He is a much better gardener 
than I am, but I am a better cook than he is; I go to his house to admire his 
bushes, but he comes to my house to eat. Kurt also gave me an interesting 
wedding present: two very tall and heavy brass candlesticks. He presented them 
unwrapped with a ribbon tied around just one of them. "Anyone getting married 
ought to have a pair of these," he said. My wife and I light them and look at 
them almost every night, and we still don't know what he means. Maybe he means 
that, if the marriage doesn't work, we are well-armed to clobber each other 
with the candlesticks; if the marriage does work, we can defend ourselves from 
our dinner guests. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt and I like each other's writing, but we hardly ever talk shop to each 
other. He has said some very kind and generous things about my work. I have 
written about his work before, in the New Republic; frankly, I have not yet 
grown tired of telling people why I think he is so special. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 years ago, in an interview, Vonnegut said: "We must acknowledge 
that the reader is doing something quite difficult for him, and the reason you 
don't change point of view too often is so he won't get lost, and the reason 
you paragraph often is so that his eyes won't get tired, so you get him without 
him knowing it by making his job easy for him." I especially love the "get him 
without him knowing it" part, but Vonnegut has been almost too successful at 
that. Among his more stupid readers are those critics who can't tell the 
difference between easy reading and easy writing; because his books are so easy 
to read, Vonnegut is accused of "easy" (or lazy) writing. I think you have to 
be a writer yourself to know how hard it is to make something easy to read -- 
or else you just have to be a little smart. 
</P>
<P>
Vonnegut's subject has always been doomsday, and nobody writes about it better. 
That he is also so terribly funny in how he describes our own worst nightmare 
is, of course, another element that confuses his dumber critics; for if 
doomsday is serious -- and the end of our world, as we know it, surely must be 
-- how can Vonnegut be both a serious fellow and a most comic novelist? Well, 
in his own time, I'm sure, the Immortal Bard of Avon must have confused such 
critics, too. In a Playboy interview, in 1973, Vonnegut was asked why his books 
were so popular with younger people; he said: "Maybe it's because I deal with 
sophomoric questions that full adults regard as settled. I talk about what God 
is like, what could He want, is there a heaven, and, if there is, what would it 
be like? This is what college sophomores are into; these are the questions they 
enjoy having discussed. And more mature people find these subjects very 
tiresome, as though they're settled." I especially love the "as though they're 
settled" part, and please note the irony in "full adults." 
</P>
<P>
In "Jailbird" (1979), President Nixon's "special adviser on youth affairs" 
conceives of this telegram to send to the President: 
</P>
<P>
YOUNG PEOPLE STILL REFUSE TO SEE THE OBVIOUS IMPOSSIBILITY OF WORLD DISARMAMENT 
AND ECONOMIC EQUALITY. COULD BE FAULT OF NEW TESTAMENT. 
</P>
<P>
And in "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater" (1965), the hero, Eliot Rosewater, is 
described as suffering from the disease of idealism -- "it attacks those 
exceedingly rare individuals who reach biological maturity still loving and 
wanting to help their fellow men." Vonnegut is similarly afflicted. 
</P>
<P>
He is also highly gifted in the craft of storytelling: While keeping to a 
single narrator, to a one-person point of view, he yet manages to interweave a 
half-dozen narrative threads and different periods of time, and a dozen or more 
major-minor characters; and he conducts this interweaving so seamlessly that he 
makes his job look easy to stupid readers. To the majority of his readers, who 
are not at all stupid, Vonnegut manages very difficult material very well. 
</P>
<P>
Now he gives us his 17th book, "Hocus Pocus," a tale told by Lt. Col. Eugene 
Debs Hartke, the last American to leave Saigon. "I invented justifications for 
all the killing and dying we were doing, which impressed even me!" Hartke says. 
"I was a genius of lethal hocus pocus!" Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Hartke gets and then loses his job at a college for dyslexics -- 
on the surface, he is fired for his sexual escapades with the president's wife, 
but in truth, he is let go for his cynicism: He erects a display of 
nonfunctioning perpetual-motion machines in the Science Building and labels 
them an example of "The Complicated Futility of Ignorance"; he tells students 
how we lost the Vietnam War. Of himself, Hartke says: "If I were a fighter 
plane instead of a human being, there would be little pictures of people 
painted all over me." 
</P>
<P>
Like so many Vonnegut narrators over the years, Hartke is a prisoner facing 
trial. Howard Campbell in "Mother Night" (1966) is writing from an Israeli 
jail, awaiting his trial for war crimes; Walter F. Starbuck in "Jailbird" 
(1979) is a Watergate criminal -- after he serves his term, he is found to be a 
criminal again ("I am a recidivist," he says; so many of Vonnegut's narrators 
are). But Hartke is not in jail for his crimes in Vietnam. He is facing trial 
for masterminding a prison break. Vonnegut's criminal narrators may be guilty 
of much, but they are typically innocent of the crime for which they are 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
The year is 2001; all prisons are "color-coded," and Hartke, having lost his 
job at the college for dyslexics, is teaching at an all-black prison when the 
escape occurs. No one believes that blacks are smart enough to engineer their 
own escape. That Hartke is charged at all is, he says, "a racist conclusion, 
based on the belief that black people couldn't mastermind anything. I will say 
so in court." 
</P>
<P>
The prison is guarded (and run for profit, successfully) by the Japanese; they 
own most of the United States, at least everything that the Germans don't own. 
Nobody of any importance uses dollars any more; anything that's worth buying is 
best paid for with yen. "There I was in late middle age," Hartke says, "cut 
loose in a thoroughly looted, bankrupt nation whose assets had been sold off to 
foreigners, a nation swamped by unchecked plagues and superstition and 
illiteracy and hypnotic TV, with virtually no health services for the poor." 
Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese warden at the prison, a witness to and survivor of Hiroshima, 
tells Hartke: "What a clever trap your Ruling Class set for us. First the 
atomic bomb. Now this. They looted your public and corporate treasuries, and 
turned your industries over to nincompoops. Then they had your Government 
borrow so heavily from us that we had no choice but to send over an Army of 
Occupation in business suits. Never before has the Ruling Class of a country 
found a way to stick other countries with all the responsibilities their wealth 
might imply, and still remain rich beyond the dreams of avarice! No wonder they 
thought the comatose Ronald Reagan was a great President!" Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
While the escaped prisoners are raping and murdering their way through the 
college for dyslexics, Hartke ruminates on the miraculous good fortune that the 
college students are away on vacation -- just imagine how much more raping and 
murdering there could have been! He also speculates that the government is 
likely to bomb both the college town and the prison. Why? "How many Americans 
knew or cared anyway where or what the Mohiga Valley was, or Laos or Cambodia 
or Tripoli? Thanks to our great educational system and TV, half of them 
couldn't even find their own country on a map of the world. Three-quarters of 
them couldn't put the cap back on a bottle of whiskey without crossing the 
threads." That's why. Vonnegut is very funny, but he's not kidding. Remember 
the Alamo? Here is how Vonnegut remembers it: "that the martyrs at the Alamo 
had died for the right to own black slaves. They didn't want to be a part of 
Mexico any more because it was against the law in that country to own slaves of 
any kind." 
</P>
<P>
Is Vonnegut an anti-American? Don't be silly! "I have no reforms to propose," 
he writes. "I think any form of government, not just Capitalism, is whatever 
the people who have all our money, drunk or sober, sane or insane, decide to do 
today." And furthermore, "All nations bigger than Denmark are crocks of 
doo-doo." So much for government; as for religion: "The most important message 
of a crucifix . . . was how unspeakably cruel supposedly sane human beings can 
be when under orders from a superior authority." As for the conquest of space 
and the presumed superiority of human beings: "Wanting every habitable planet 
to be inhabited is like wanting everybody to have athlete's foot." Vonnegut 
does not worship a single sacred cow -- not even "high art" escapes unscathed. 
"Making the most of the materials of futility," he calls it. 
</P>
<P>
The only precept that Hartke honors is taught to him by his grandfather: "that 
profanity and obscenity entitle people who don't want inconvenient information 
to close their ears and eyes to you"; therefore, Hartke's language is 
squeaky-clean. He also tries to be kind; his illegitimate son is named Rob Roy, 
after the mixed drink of that name, but Hartke indulges his son's belief that 
he is named for the novel by Sir Walter Scott. "What good would it do him or 
anybody else to know that he was named for two shots of Scotch, one shot of 
sweet vermouth, cracked ice, and a twist of lemon peel?" What good, indeed! 
</P>
<P>
On a personal level, Hartke's failure is as painful as Vietnam; as he awaits 
his trial, his wife and mother-in-law are in an insane asylum -- both of them 
went crazy in middle age, and now Hartke's children suspect that the same 
craziness awaits them. "Our children, full-grown now, can never forgive us for 
reproducing," he says. "What a mess." 
</P>
<P>
What a metaphor! It stands so directly for the national and planetary disaster 
that we are leaving to our children. Anyone who thinks Vonnegut isn't "serious" 
is truly full of doo-doo. 
</P>
<P>
"Hocus Pocus" is as good as the best of his novels -- these being, in my 
opinion, "Cat's Cradle" (1963), "Mother Night" (1966), "Slaughterhouse-Five" 
(1969) and "Jailbird" (1979); although, how long has it been since you've read 
a first novel as good and prophetically on-target as "Player Piano"? And for 
the appreciative Vonnegut reader, those crafty Tralfamadorians are back in 
"Hocus Pocus"; I don't want to spoil the story, but everyone on Tralfamadore 
knows "that germs, not people, (are) the darlings of the Universe." And those 
escaped prisoners who rape and murder the faculty of the college for dyslexics, 
and many poor souls in the college town, guess what they are called: "Freedom 
Fighters!" Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
Vonnegut quotes everyone from Shakespeare to Jean-Paul Sartre to Eugene Debs; 
unlike most writers, however, he is honest and unpretentious enough to admit 
his source. "I have lifted this speech from Bartlett's Familiar Quotations," he 
says (repeatedly). "If more people would acknowledge that they got their pearls 
of wisdom from that book instead of the original, it might clear the air." 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, I must confess that I lifted that D. H. Lawrence quote from a 
little paperback called "The Writer's Quotation Book." I have no idea where 
Lawrence wrote that business about "subtle interrelatedness"; I suppose I can't 
really be certain that he did write it. As usual, Vonnegut has helped to clear 
the air.

CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS; 
</P>
<P>
YOSEMITE; THE EMBATTLED WILDERNESS BY ALFRED RUNTE (UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA: 
$24.95; 271 PP., ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David M. Graber, Graber is a research biologist with the National Park 
Service. He began his Park Service career while a student at Berkeley and 
obtained his Ph.D. studying the bears of Yosemite. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the last weeks of its first century, Yosemite National Park captured the 
nation's attention with great fires. It will be tragic irony if these 
lightning-generated pyrotechnics, as natural to the Sierra Nevada as waterfalls 
and granite, deflect our thoughts from the real, man-made threats facing one of 
America's most beloved places. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to Yosemite Valley this year will overwhelm you with souvenir tributes 
to the park's centennial. Alfred Runte's dark history stands in stark contrast: 
His celebratory effort broods over the past century's battles between the 
forces of vision and those of exploitation. Runte calls himself an 
"environmental historian." Author of "National Parks: The American Experience" 
(1979), this academic-without-portfolio offers a free-wheeling, controversial 
and scholarly critique of Yosemite's first 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
The official touchstones of Yosemite's history are its discovery by whites and 
the rapid extirpation of the native Ahwahneechees led by Tenaya in the mid-19th 
Century; the Yosemite Park Act of 1864 establishing a protected reserve of the 
Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias; its expansion and full-fledged 
establishment as a national park in 1890; John Muir's heroic but failed 
campaign to save Hetch-Hetchy Valley from damming in 1913, and lastly the 
establishment of the National Park Service in 1916. But although he 
acknowledges these historical markers, Runte is after subtler, and ultimately 
more important, game. 
</P>
<P>
"Among all of the debates affecting America's national parks, the most enduring 
-- and most intense -- is where to draw the line between preservation and use." 
Runte's first sentence signals his anthem. His improbable heroes are a line of 
scientists tracing their heritage to Joseph Grinnell of the University of 
California's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
In Runte's eyes, these men -- beginning with Grinnell himself in the early days 
of the national park -- saw Yosemite as a great reserve of wild nature, a 
source of scientific information and understanding. They used reason to 
campaign patiently for what we today would call the "wilderness ecosystem" 
model of a national park. "And so to Berkeley professors, students and alumni 
went the honor of founding Yosemite's 'university of the wilderness.' From its 
graduates, Grinnell now looked forward to the evolution of a new public 
consciousness of the importance of national parks as refuges for biological 
diversity." 
</P>
<P>
Runte's villains are an even longer line of despoilers and developers who saw 
money to be made in Yosemite and largely accomplished their mission. Their 
progenitors were the first to build hotels and plant orchards to service 
Yosemite's pioneer visitors in the 1860s, and fought tirelessly to maintain and 
expand their claims on park land. Runte sees an unbroken line of concessioners 
leading to the mighty Yosemite Park and Curry Co., Yosemite's sole proprietor 
of bed, drink and lodging, today a wholly owned subsidiary of the Music Corp. 
of America (MCA). Runte hyperventilates between his lines when he reports 
Edward C. Hardy, president of the Curry Co., calling Yosemite a "destination 
resort." 
</P>
<P>
And just where does the National Park Service and its predecessor stewards of 
Yosemite fit in Runte's scenario? They are the largely unimaginative pawns of 
politics, conservation's eunuchs, seeking always for compromise drawn from the 
seemingly contradictory aims of the National Park Service Act: "to conserve the 
scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to 
provide the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will 
leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." 
</P>
<P>
Every compromise, finds Runte, has taken Yosemite further from its wild 
beginnings. Referring to Horace Albright, the Park Service's co-founder: "Park 
Service tradition, Albright confirmed, leaned heavily toward public works . . . 
in Albright's estimation, development was a given and therefore became a basis 
for comparison instead of an object properly targeted for exclusion. . . . The 
point he refused to acknowledge was that development itself, whether modern or 
crude, perhaps should never have been allowed inside Yosemite National Park." 
Runte effectively uses a long, detailed section on the history of bear 
management in Yosemite to illustrate how natural resources have suffered, 
rather than inconvenience visitors or proprietors. 
</P>
<P>
There is, oddly enough, a minor fourth element in "The Embattled Wilderness" -- 
park visitors. In the grand play between preservationists and developers, both 
of whom claim to be serving some public, the Park Service ineffectually acting 
as umpire, Runte's grandstands are largely silent. In truth, none of the 
principals in this heroic drama can claim to represent the real wishes of 
Yosemite's millions of annual visitors, or the values of its 200 million 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
The park concessioners, Curry Co. back through its predecessors, have had no 
trouble filling their rooms, bars, restaurants, and tour buses, nor selling 
their trinkets. There is more than a year's wait for room reservations as I 
write this -- surely, by some standards, an argument for more accommodations. 
On the other hand, when the Park Service queried its public in the 1970s for a 
revision of its General Management Plan, it found strong sentiment for 
de-urbanizing Yosemite Valley, for the reduction of structures and services. 
</P>
<P>
As an ecologist, I am pleased by Runte's focus on natural resources, and the 
long relationship between UC Berkeley's field biologists and the evolving 
management of Yosemite. True enough, Joseph Grinnell, Joe Dixon, George Wright 
and A. Starker Leopold exhausted half a century trying to instill the notion of 
a wild biotic reserve upon the Park Service. Equally true, Yosemite's waters 
still are befouled by introduced trout; its bears still trapped and sometimes 
killed to pay for visitors' sins; its forests deflected from their ancient 
rhythms by the need to protect people and their possessions from fire. Yet the 
words of Yosemite's ecological sages have -- however belatedly -- largely found 
their way into contemporary policy and practice. 
</P>
<P>
Runte makes a relentless case that overcrowded, overprostituted Yosemite must 
be rationed; therefore why not reduce its amenities, and in so doing reduce the 
attraction to those who seek pleasures that can be purchased elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
In his tough treatment, Runte conveniently ignores the larger world in which 
Yosemite National Park must function and always has functioned. It is a social 
and a political construct; it and its stewards always have reflected the 
context of their times. Grinnell and his students weren't merely ahead of the 
Park Service; as academics they were free to be visionaries and properly 
outraced social values. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Yosemite faces new perils that Runte fails to address: air pollution 
attacking its ecosystems; development on its boundaries making it a biological 
island; political limits on the fires its forests demand, and the likelihood 
that climate change may yet destroy the nearly intact ecosystem painfully 
conserved thus far. 
</P>
<P>
Without the best scientific effort and intense social commitment, Yosemite will 
not survive its second century.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING HYPOTHESIS; 
</P>
<P>
OUT THERE THE GOVERNMENT'S SECRET QUEST FOR EXTRATERRESTRIALS BY HOWARD BLUM 
(SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $19.95; 288 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Philip J. Klass, Klass, senior avionics editor for Aviation Week &amp; Space 
Technology magazine for nearly 35 years and now a contributing editor, is a 
skeptical UFO investigator. He has authored four books on the subject, 
including UFOs: The Public Deceived (Prometheus Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This is a true story," former New York Times reporter Howard Blum assures his 
readers in the opening page of this book. "I verified every name, every 
incident, date and conversation." 
</P>
<P>
The publisher's blurb on the review copy characterizes the book as a "startling 
expose that reads with the dramatic narrative drive of a novel but . . . it is 
absolutely true!" 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of Blum's book is his claim that in early 1987, the Pentagon's 
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) secretly launched a new investigation into 
UFOs -- unidentified flying objects. Approximately 18 years earlier, the 
Pentagon had announced it was closing down the U.S. Air Force's investigatory 
effort after two decades because it had found no evidence that any UFOs were 
either extraterrestrial or Soviet craft. 
</P>
<P>
Blum, whose earlier books include one on the Walker spy family, claims that the 
Pentagon's new interest in UFOs was triggered by an extraordinary incident that 
occurred shortly before Christmas, 1986. It allegedly involved the Navy Space 
Surveillance System (NSSS), a key element in the global Space Surveillance 
Network operated by the U.S. Space Command. 
</P>
<P>
The NSSS is an "electronic fence" that stretches across our Southern states 
from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. It was built in the late 1950s, 
following the launch of the first Soviet satellites, to enable Washington to 
maintain a running inventory of all objects in space -- both satellites and 
space debris -- that pass over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
As Blum describes the incident, Navy Cmdr. Sheila Mondran was on duty in Space 
Command's underground command center, deep inside Cheyenne Mountain near 
Colorado Springs, when a computer display showed a strange, uncatalogued space 
object passing through the electronic fence. According to Blum, the object was 
performing "crash dives followed by sudden climbs at astonishing speeds." 
</P>
<P>
Had Blum checked, he would have discovered that the Navy's electronic fence 
could not possibly have detected such maneuvers -- as I earlier learned when I 
wrote a technical article on the system. Furthermore, the system does not 
provide a "real-time" display at Space Command's center, which Blum claims 
Mondran was viewing. 
</P>
<P>
Blum's dramatic scenario of events alleged to have triggered the Pentagon's 
renewed interest in UFOs is riddled with errors. For example, he reports that 
Cmdr. Mondran, after parking her car outside Cheyenne Mountain, rode a military 
bus inside and "took a polished steel elevator . . . descending almost 2500 
ft." There is no such elevator -- as I know from my several visits to the 
underground center. The only elevator is a three-story freight elevator. 
</P>
<P>
The military bus would have delivered Cmdr. Mondran to the "ground floor" of 
the command center inside Cheyenne Mountain. She would have walked up one 
flight of stairs to the Space Defense Center, which is on the second floor, not 
the third floor as Blum reports. (Blum claims he called Space Command to ask 
which floor it was on, as an example of his meticulous research.) 
</P>
<P>
In response to my request to Space Command's public-affairs office, Maj. Tom 
Niemann told me he could find no record that a Cmdr. Sheila Mondran had been 
stationed there. When he checked with the Navy, Niemann told me, they could not 
find any record of an officer named Sheila Mondran. 
</P>
<P>
Blum describes experiments allegedly conducted by the DIA using "remote 
viewers" ("psychics") who, he claims, demonstrated the ability to "see," and 
thus pinpoint, the location of submerged Soviet and U.S. submarines. When the 
DIA learned of the extraordinary UFO incident, Blum claims, it brought in three 
psychics to "see" retroactively what the object looked like when it penetrated 
the electronic fence 48 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
All three of the psychics drew sketches of "rounded, wingless aircraft," Blum 
tells his readers. Armed with these sketches of flying saucers, Army Col. 
Harold E. Phillips, a DIA intelligence analyst with a long-time interest in 
UFOs, according to Blum, managed to convince his agency that "the time had at 
last come to convene a top-secret working group to investigate the possibility 
that extraterrestrials were making contact with this planet." 
</P>
<P>
Although Blum claims to have talked briefly with Col. Phillips by telephone, 
the only officer with that name who shows up in Army records is a lieutenant 
colonel (not a full colonel), and he retired three years before the purported 
UFO group was formed. Pentagon telephone directories for 1987-88 show an "H. E. 
Phillips," but he is a Navy commander, not an Army colonel. To avoid any 
possibility of Pentagon "disinformation," I checked the University of Southern 
Illinois, in Carbondale, from which Blum says Phillips graduated with a degree 
in engineering. The university could not find any record of a Harold E. 
Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
According to Blum, the most vexing problem that confronted Phillips, as chief 
of the UFO Working Group, was to find a "highly promising" UFO report for the 
panel to investigate. Blum writes: "For a time, the colonel was convinced he 
had found his investigative target in Gulf Breeze, Florida. The sightings in 
this Southern town were shared by a variety of witnesses, and there was even a 
blurred film of what many responsible observers swore was a UFO. It turned out 
the Air Force was testing a classified low-flying surveillance plane in the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
This explanation is seriously flawed. The object that appeared on the Polaroid 
prints of Floridian Ed Walters was saucer-shaped with illuminated portholes -- 
hardly an appropriate design for a "low-flying surveillance plane." This 
explanation also is ruled out if one accepts Walters' claim that he saw 
four-foot-high creatures being "beamed-down" from the UFO. 
</P>
<P>
There was slight blurring of the background in a few of Walters' photos, due to 
camera motion during the one-second time-exposure used for the night photos, 
but the image of the UFO was not blurred. This logically prompted even some 
long-time "UFO believers" to conclude that the photos were hoax 
double-exposures made with a small model. Recently, a small model flying saucer 
similar to the UFO in the Walters photos was discovered hidden in the attic of 
the house in which he lived when he took his UFO photos. 
</P>
<P>
Next, according to Blum, Col. Phillips' interest focused on reports of night 
sightings of a giant UFO reported by many observers in Hudson Valley 
communities north of New York City. "But then, just when Col. Phillips was on 
the verge of recommending that the Working Group dispatch a photographic team" 
to the area, according to Blum, he received a newspaper report that the giant 
UFO was nothing more than a group of small-aircraft pilots engaged in a prank. 
More than three years earlier, this hoax had been reported by Discover magazine 
in the cover story of its November, 1984, issue. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips finally discovered a "perfect candidate" for the UFO Working Group to 
investigate: Elmwood, a small town in central Wisconsin. Elmwood's citizens 
often report seeing UFOs, and its mayor had announced plans to build a $50 
million UFO landing site. Blum claims Phillips sent two covert agents to 
Elmwood, which prompted Blum's own visit. He arrived in time for Elmwood's 
annual "UFO Days" festival and devoted about one-sixth of his book to his 
interviews with local citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, writes Blum, Col. Phillips learned of the "Top Secret MJ-12 
papers," made public by three UFOlogists in the spring of 1987, which claim 
that the U.S. government recovered a crashed saucer and several 
extraterrestrial bodies about 40 years earlier. If the MJ-12 claims were true, 
clearly somebody forgot to brief the top DIA officials who had approved 
creation of the UFO Working Group. Blum provides an even-handed pro/con 
treatment, indicating he himself is unsure whether they are authentic. 
</P>
<P>
I appear in Blum's book as the person whose research indicates that the MJ-12 
papers are counterfeit. Blum offers a not-unflattering summary of my career as 
a technical journalist and skeptical UFO investigator. I was rather surprised 
at his reference to my "jaunty, pencil-thin figure," because we never have met 
and I have been 10 pounds overweight for 30 years. (We did talk by telephone on 
several occasions.) I counted 24 other factual errors in the five pages in 
which Blum highlights my career. 
</P>
<P>
During my Jan. 20, 1989, telephone conversation with Blum, he admitted: "All I 
have now is a nice weird story and you can poke a thousand holes in it." That 
aptly summarizes the tale he tells in "Out There," which could more accurately 
be titled "Spaced Out."

<P>
TRUMP SURVIVING AT THE TOP BY DONALD J. TRUMP WITH CHARLES LEERHSEN (RANDOM 
HOUSE: $21.95; 236 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-394-57597-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Rothchild, Rothchild is the author of A Fool and His Money: The Odyssey 
of an Average Investor, published by Viking in 1988. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why couldn't Donald Trump quit while he was ahead? He already owned Trump's 
Castle, Trump Tower, Trump Plaza and Trump Parc, and all of them "great deals," 
so what did he need with the disastrous Taj Mahal of Debt? Why build another 
casino? 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, why write another book? 
</P>
<P>
But, alas, he did write another book, "Trump: Surviving at the Top," which is 
another kind of great deal, ranking right up there with "Vanna Speaks." It came 
out in New York the very week that Trump's lenders in New Jersey were working 
overtime to stave off the imminent bankruptcy of the great "survivor of 
success" himself, now saddled with the Taj Majal of Debt. 
</P>
<P>
The title alone, "Surviving at the Top," is so perversely marvelous that there 
ought to be a contest to invent others that could equal it. Here are a few 
candidates: Marie Antoinette's "Keeping My Head," Achilles' "Recovering From a 
Hamstring Injury," Gen. Custer's "Outfoxing the Enemy" and Jean Claude 
Duvalier's "President for Life." 
</P>
<P>
Have you seen the cover? There's the celestial Trump, floating in the clouds 
like a Tiepolo angel and flipping an apple into the air. The apple is supposed 
to represent New York, so you get the idea that Trump has New York in the palm 
of his hand, and the expression on his face says: "I've made it, you schmucks, 
and too bad about you." 
</P>
<P>
Compare this celestial Trump on the cover of the new book to the one on the 
cover of the first book -- "Trump: The Art of the Deal" -- where the man 
appears to be sitting in a window, slightly elevated but within sight of the 
ground -- and you realize how far Trump has risen in his own estimation, even 
in the short space of three years. 
</P>
<P>
Compare the text of the new book to that of the old (there's a different 
ghostwriter this time) and you'll notice an obvious increase in the employment 
of flattering adjectives, such as: "dazzling trophy" (Trump's yacht), "fabulous 
structure" (his Plaza hotel), "marvelous facility" (a Trump casino), 
"jewel-encrusted casino" (another Trump plaything), "the magnificent Taj Mahal" 
(the Trump Taj Mahal), the "best airline of its kind" (the Trump shuttle), 
"adoring crowds," "huge talent" and "celebrity-studded events." 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the Trump books have a definite new appeal in the 
humor category, which is how I would market them if I were Random House or 
Warner, right alongside Dave Barry. Throughout, there are funny quotes, such 
as: "Bankers now come to me to ask if I might be interested in borrowing their 
money. They know a safe bet"; or "I'm going to be building when everybody else 
has gone bust"; or Trump's advice to Mike Tyson: "Stay out of investments in 
real- estate deals and tax shelters." 
</P>
<P>
Another rewarding way to read Trump is to study both volumes simultaneously. 
This, I found, gives many clues as to what has happened to Trump to drive him 
toward insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
In Trump's initial memoir from three years ago, he was nearly all business: 
haggling, niggling, finding the good deals that would make him rich. In the 
photo section of the first book, there are two pages of Trump appearing with 
various "hot people," such as Herschel Walker and the Reagans, but seven pages 
of Trump's marvelous buildings. This more or less indicates where Trump's 
priorities lay: seven-to-two, assets over celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
In "Surviving at the Top," photos of Trump buildings have been reduced to three 
pages, while there are 10 pages of him standing with Hulk Hogan, the Muppets, 
Michael Jackson, Don Johnson, George Bush, Sugar Ray Leonard, Benazir Bhutto, 
Mike Wallace and Mike Tyson, whom Trump describes as "more than just a great 
boxer . . . one of the most talked-about people in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the photo ratio, you begin to suspect that keeping up with 
investments has not been as interesting to Trump as keeping up with 
talked-about people, which seems to have become the man's real full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
Should Trump personally welcome Kitty Dukakis to the Plaza Hotel? Should he 
retaliate against a major designer, whom he once helped with a substance-abuse 
problem and who has snubbed Trump's latest fashion show? Should he lend his 
helicopter to the Duchess of York? Should he refuse to shake Mick Jagger's hand 
after Jagger has hogged a press conference at one of Trump's casinos? Should he 
let Time magazine put him on the cover? Should he tolerate Frank Sinatra's 
boorish behavior at a nightclub? 
</P>
<P>
These are only a few of the many social issues that demand Trump's attention in 
"Surviving at the Top." "Fame is a kind of drug," he observes, "one that is way 
too powerful for most people to handle." You can't doubt that he's been 
handling it full-time after you've read Chapter 4, entitled "Life at the Top," 
where we're let in on the challenges of Trump's schedule. Several days of it 
are excerpted here: 
</P>
<P>
9 a.m. Learns that he will be honored at a Police Athletic League dinner. 
</P>

7:30 p.m. Has dinner at Le Cirque "one of New York's hottest and most exclusive 
restaurants." Runs into Richard Nixon there. 
</P>
<P>
Trump doesn't even bother to describe the deal that was cooking at 4 p.m. As a 
matter of fact, there's no hint that he's thought about the casino business, 
nor the hotel business (except for the re-gilding at the Plaza), for at least 
72 hours. Is it any surprise that Trump didn't even realize he was no longer 
worth a billion dollars? 
</P>
<P>
I base that conclusion on the fact that Trump is infuriated that Forbes 
magazine dared to print the ugly rumor that he wasn't worth a billion dollars. 
This bothered him more than anything said about his sex life in the tabloids. 
(Actually, he seems rather to enjoy what's said about him in the tabloids -- 
"I've never had any trouble in bed," he cannily discloses.) When Forbes spread 
the vicious gossip about his net worth, he had to retaliate: 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, journalistic attacks have little to do with the pursuit of truth. 
The cover story Forbes magazine did on me in its May 14, 1990, issue is a case 
in point. HOW MUCH IS DONALD TRUMP WORTH? the headline asked. The answer, 
according to Forbes, was about $500 million -- or much LESS than the $1.7 
billion the magazine said I was worth a year before. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Forbes, in my opinion, undervalued such possessions of mine as, among others, 
the Plaza Hotel, the Trump Shuttle and seventy-eight acres of land I own on 
Manhattan's Upper West Side. Who can say what these one-of-a-kind assets are 
worth until they're put on the market? Certainly not a mediocre reporter from 
Forbes named Richard Stern. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
After having put Stern in his place, Trump goes on to speculate that the late 
Malcolm Forbes was personally out to get him on account of: (1) yacht envy, the 
magnificent Trump Princess measuring 282 feet to Forbes' relatively paltry 150 
feet; (2) an incident at the Oak Room Bar in the Plaza Hotel, when Forbes' 
underaged guest was refused a seat by the management. 
</P>
<P>
Now, just as all of this is appearing in print, the truth that Trump was trying 
to suppress has come out: The Forbes estimate of Trump's net worth was, if 
anything, generous. Trump is a walking Brazil. He can't pay the interest on his 
loans, and he might be worth less than you and me, less than the New England 
banks, less even than ousted Canadian CEO Robert Campeau. 
</P>
<P>
It may turn out to be worse than the accountants think, since they already have 
counted as an asset the $1 million in royalties that Trump expects to make from 
"Surviving at the Top." 
</P>
<P>
So don't think of this as a book purchase. Think of it as a charitable 
contribution.

<P>
Your profile of Rabbi Hier incorrectly stated that no leaders of the Jewish 
community publicly opposed the California Legislature's $5-million 
appropriation to the center's Museum of Tolerance in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the American Jewish Congress testified in Sacramento against this 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
AJC believed that such a gift of public funds violated the constitutional 
principles of church / state separation and, equally important, represented bad 
public policy. We also found this legislative request hypocritical, since the 
Wiesenthal Center had previously assured potential donors that it had never and 
would never seek government money. 
</P>
<P>
After Gov. George Deukmejian approved this $5-million appropriation, two 
prominent leaders of Los Angeles' Jewish community, David and Rosetta Cohen, 
filed a lawsuit against the center challenging this grant's constitutionality. 
That suit resulted in an out-of-court settlement.

<TEXT>
<P>
As a survivor of the Holocaust in Poland, I must say that Rabbi Marvin Hier 
("The Unorthodox Rabbi," July 15) is a hard-core realist. 
</P>
<P>
He is quite aware that centuries of anti-Semitism, inspired by Christianity, 
culminated in the Holocaust and cannot be erased with a smile and a handshake. 
Every type of anti-Semitism, anywhere in the world, is a seed for future 
Holocausts. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Hier is a contrast to all those moderate and liberal present-day Jewish 
leaders who unfortunately are infected with hypocrisy and who deceive 
themselves that we have friends waiting for us everywhere. We need more leaders 
like Rabbi Hier.

What a guy, that Marvin Hier! He fights anti-Semitism, finds aging Nazis and 
remembers the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
Why, he even educates people about the Armenian genocide. But his new tourist 
attraction should not be named the Museum of Tolerance. Some years ago his 
center gave an award to U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Jeanne 
Kirkpatrick for her support of Israel, the same Jeanne Kirkpatrick who has 
supported every pseudodemocratic (read: fascist) government in Central America. 
If it was not nice to murder Jews in the past, it is also not nice for the U.S. 
government to sponsor dictators who murder our Central American neighbors. 
Hier's center is no longer deluged by my $10 donations.

THE MAGICIAN AND THE PROPHET; 
</P>
<P>
THE MASK OF NOSTRADAMUS BY JAMES RANDI (CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS: $19.95; 320 
PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-684-19056-7) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Malcolm Dean, Dean is author of The Astrology Game (Beaufort). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The printing press was barely 33 years old when Michel de Notredame 
(Nostradamus) was born in Provence. In 1503, the new technology already was 
bringing authors to celebrity and wealth as it penetrated middle- and 
upper-class society. 
</P>
<P>
In 1550, Nostradamus began issuing his annual astrological almanacs, launching 
a career that would guarantee his place in history. Five years later, the first 
edition of his most famous work, the "Centuries," appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Each "Century" was a volume of 100 prophetic verses, or quatrains, cloaked in 
obscure references and open to many interpretations. So popular were his 
prophecies that Catherine de Medicis, the queen of France, summoned Nostradamus 
for a royal audience. Already a physician widely noted for his ability to treat 
the plague, Nostradamus thus achieved the status of medieval "superstar." 
</P>
<P>
To this day, the "Centuries" of Nostradamus have remained in print in one form 
or another. Frequently embellished with interpretations or attacks intended to 
prove or disprove his prophetic powers, his writings have spawned an entire 
literature with its own 400-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Few, if any, of the commentators can claim to have been impartial. In fact, not 
a few were deliberately bending the prophet's words to suit their particular 
political ends. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, British Intelligence distributed thousands of copies of 
"improved" Nostradamus quatrains throughout Europe in a "black" operation 
designed to suggest that Nostradamus actually had predicted the fate of Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
To this dubious literature must now be added James Randi's new book, "The Mask 
of Nostradamus." A professional magician and recipient of the MacArthur 
Foundation's "genius" award, Randi is active in a movement of academics and 
scientists who speak out against the paranormal at every possible opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Although this book is subtitled "A Biography of the World's Most Famous 
Prophet," its short biographical sections are scattered between large sections 
in which Randi launches attacks on Jeane Dixon, card sharks, modern astrology 
and "Nostradamians." 
</P>
<P>
By turns a biography, an overview of 16th-Century science and society, a 
debunker's guide to the techniques employed by false prophets, and a fresh 
analysis of some quatrains, the tone of the book varies wildly. 
</P>
<P>
Randi's style is a curious amalgam of romantic musings -- "Unsolved puzzles and 
unanswered questions, order among chaos and ripples in the fabric of the 
universe are all matters to ponder" -- and awkward passages: "Implacable 
authorities can often be placated." 
</P>
<P>
Though his research eventually led him to respect Nostradamus for his "worth as 
a physician and as a poet, his perserverance and courage," Randi goes beyond 
laying out the evidence and frequently makes disparaging and manipulative 
comments that demean the reader. 
</P>
<P>
In his eagerness to put down anyone -- past or present -- who does not share 
his materialistic viewpoint, he casually lumps Nostradamus and Paracelsus (an 
important figure in the history of medicine) together with Rasputin and 
Cagliostro as "charlatans of note." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his distaste for the occult, Randi suggests that the good doctor was an 
intelligent man swept up by the popular success of his almanacs, forced to play 
out the role of seer for his public. 
</P>
<P>
Randi has been making things disappear for his entire career, both as a stage 
magician and a professional debunker. Unfortunately for his credibility, in 
digressing repeatedly into attacks on astrology he also makes important parts 
of the story conveniently disappear. 
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-'70s, Randi has been involved with an organization of debunkers 
called the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the 
Paranormal (CSICOP). With strong contacts throughout the media and academia, 
CSICOP has been in a position to manipulate coverage of experiments in the 
paranormal. (Several of CSICOP's founding members were performing magicians.) 
</P>
<P>
Believing that to disprove astrology might be to rescue consumers from 
surrendering "individual control of their destiny" to the occult, Randi and his 
colleagues took aim at the most extensive and scientific evidence available for 
planetary influence in human behavior, a massive statistical experiment 
performed by the French psychologists Michel and Francoise Gauguelin. 
</P>
<P>
While the Gauguelins' results argue for a statistical correlation between the 
position of some planets at birth and the profession later taken up by the 
individual, they do not support modern astrological methods. 
</P>
<P>
Presuming that it would be an easy matter to disprove the results (and possibly 
even expose the Gauguelins as merely another couple of charlatans), Randi and 
his colleagues participated in several major replications of the experiments, 
with positive results. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the horrible prospect that they had, in fact, strengthened the case 
for what was called "the Mars effect," they could not deny the results. But 
they could make them disappear. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of this deception, several founding members, including astronomer 
Dennis Rawlins and the late psychologist Richard Kammann, departed in protest. 
Rawlins later published a pamphlet on the results of the CSICOP experiments 
entitled "Star Baby." Very recently, the Gauguelin results received yet another 
independent confirmation by Prof. S. Ertel of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Randi chooses to ignore these events, with which he was closely associated, and 
he continues to appear in print and in interviews, acting as if he and his 
colleagues were not caught suppressing uncomfortable research results while 
waving the banner of impartial scientific investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Given the huge emphasis Randi places upon debunking astrology in a volume 
misleadingly (and inaccurately) subtitled "The First Biography of Nostradamus," 
this omission is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Randi reveals himself as neither a scholar nor a reliable critic, but as a 
tub-thumper. Only those who already agree with his conclusions will enjoy the 
tune he bangs out. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Michel de Notredame! He failed to predict how long it would be before a 
talented historian might provide us with the facts, all the facts, and only the 
facts.

BIOGRAPHY 
</P>
<P>
A FIRST-CLASS TEMPERAMENT; The Emergence of Franklin Roosevelt by Geoffrey C. 
Ward (Harper &amp; Row) 
</P>
<P>
Meeting Franklin Delano Roosevelt shortly after his ascension to the Presidency 
in 1933, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes described him as "a second-class 
intellect. But a first-class temperament." This second volume of Ward's lively 
and psychologically revealing biography begins with his honeymoon abroad in 
1905 and concludes with his election as Governor of New York in 1928. Ward's 
portrait provides a balance to the well-known characterization of Roosevelt as 
a "gregarious, graceful and ebullient man." Here he is revealed also as a 
"consummate actor," a trait which, for all the damage it often wreaks, served 
him well in coping with the devastation of poliomyelitis. 
</P>
<P>
THE IRON LADY; A Biography of Margaret Thatcher by Hugo Young (Farrar, Straus 
&amp; Giroux) 
</P>
<P>
The central riddle revealed here is why, as a woman in a man's world, Margaret 
Thatcher evinces such an exclusionary attitude toward women. The British Prime 
Minister's stance stems from her "barely tolerant" childhood view of her mother 
juxtaposed with the idolization of her father. From her father, Young argues, 
she inherited a "joyless earnestness" that combined with her early interest in 
science to produce the roots of her public character. "She did not ponder 
problems; she wanted solutions. . . . Political intellectuals interested her to 
the extent that they offered solutions." The author, whose career as a 
political columnist has coincided with Thatcher's as political leader, 
describes two qualities that are her greatest strengths: her "sense of moral 
rectitude" and her political intuition. 
</P>
<P>
MEANS OF ASCENT; The Years of Lyndon Johnson by Robert A. Caro (Alfred A. 
Knopf) 
</P>
<P>
The Pulitizer Prize-winning author's second book in a projected four-volume 
work on the life of one of our most complex presidents. It is a dark and 
unrelenting portrayal of the way in which the humiliation of sudden poverty at 
age 13 led to Lyndon Johnson's quest for power at nearly any cost. More 
importantly, this painstakingly documented account also unflinchingly reveals 
the corrupt relationship between ends and means in American political life. The 
author, a former investigative journalist, was able to elicit untapped 
recollections from Johnson's old cronies. One of the most dramatic passages is 
an analysis of the mysterious 1948 senatorial contest that Johnson at his most 
desperate managed to win by the "87 votes that changed history." 
</P>
<P>
SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR; A Biography by Deirdre Bair (Summit Books) 
</P>
<P>
Deirdre Bair commenced the research for this book with two questions: "How 
could that well-brought-up little Catholic girl have found the courage to 
become the fearless, free-spirited adult who gave as good as she got in the 
often vicious arena of Paris intellectualism? And as for 'The Second Sex,' from 
what place within her creative consciousness had that book come?" It took the 
author, recipient of the National Book Award for her biography of Samuel 
Beckett, seven years to answer these questions. The product is by turns 
literary biography, intellectual history, feminist theory and oral history. 
</P>
<P>
THE FIVE OF HEARTS; An Intimate Portrait of Henry Adams and His Friends, 
1880-1918 by Patricia O'Toole (Clarkson N. Potter/Crown) 
</P>
<P>
An intimate, gossipy, yet graceful and well-researched social history of an 
elite group of influential Americans who first came together in Washington, 
D.C., in the winter of 1880-1881 as privileged bons vivants needing an 
appreciative outlet for their unconventional energies, ideas and wit. The 
social circle was composed of Henry Adams, historian and descendant of 
presidents; his wife, Clover; Secretary of State John Hay and his wife, Clara; 
Clarence King, geologist, leader of the great Fortieth Parallel survey. Often 
compared to the Bloomsbury group, the fivesome dubbed themselves "The Five of 
Hearts." Although intimates, they kept to themselves their most intriguing 
secrets (King, considered a bachelor, at his death was discovered to have left 
behind a black common-law wife and five children). Their "little White House" 
gatherings at the Lafayette Square home of the Adamses included Presidents from 
Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt, along with other such influential figures as 
Henry James, Edith Wharton, Mark Twain and Andrew Carnegie.

DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT; Culture and Technology in the Twentieth 
Century by O. B. Hardison Jr. (Viking) 
</P>
<P>
A startlingly original examination of change in modern culture and what it 
bodes for the future of human values. "Is the idea of what it is to be human 
disappearing, along with so many other ideas, through the modern skylight?" 
Hardison asks. He reviews the ways in which central concepts in five basic 
interrelated areas -- nature, history, language, art and human evolution -- "no 
longer seem to objectify a real world. It is as though progress were making the 
real world invisible." People who have made the transition across this "horizon 
of invisibility," he explains, put their experience not into familiar words and 
images but into symbols that cannot be understood by those who have not yet 
made the transition to modern culture -- thus, another "disappearance." 
</P>
<P>
THE POLITICS OF RICH AND POOR; Wealth and the American Electorate in the Reagan 
Aftermath by Kevin Phillips (Random House) 
</P>
<P>
This highly readable book could serve as a wake-up button. Political analyst 
Kevin Phillips draws a convincing portrait of the new political economics as a 
deliberate quest to intensify oppression of the poor while fostering 
unprecedented growth of upper-bracket wealth. Directly related are the growth 
of federal debt, global economic realignment, foreigners devouring large chunks 
of American real estate, and "the meaninglessness of being a millionaire in an 
era with nearly a hundred thousand 'decamillionaires.' " His supporting data 
are as persuasive as his main point: that a Populist backlash in the 1990s is 
both needed and inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
DISTURBING THE PEACE; A Conversation With Karel Hvizdala by Vaclav Havel 
translated by Paul Wilson (Alfred A. Knopf) 
</P>
<P>
"The history of this book has been marked by history itself," says the preface. 
Indeed. The "conversation" from exile that forms this book is actually a set of 
prescient answers to carefully wrought questions posed through underground mail 
to the rebel playwright three years before the startling events that would lead 
to Havel's election as president of Czechoslovakia. The changed context 
provides an ironic gift for the reader. On the eve of his 50th birthday, Havel 
remembers the political and literary battles of his youth, his involvement in 
the Prague Spring of 1968, what it is to be an artist under constant 
surveillance and harassment by the police, the years of imprisonment and his 
involvement in the civic struggle to bring moral responsibility back into his 
country's public life.

MY TRAITOR'S HEART; A South African Exile Returns to Face His Country, His 
Tribe, and His Conscience by Rian Malan (A Morgan Entrekin Book/ Atlantic 
Monthly Press) 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the white master tribe of South Africa, the author grew up 
thinking himself a "Just White Man." Then he took a job as a police reporter 
and the truth about the fear and violence in his homeland set in. He fled to 
America in 1977 and remained in exile for eight years, contemplating his 
country and his family, which included both white and black relatives linked by 
secret ties of blood. Finally, he decided to go back to seek the truth, which 
became the motivating force for this book: "I had always been two people, you 
see . . . A Just White Man appalled by the cruelties Afrikaners inflicted on 
Africans, and an Afrikaner appalled by the cruelties Africans inflicted on each 
other and might one day inflict on us. There were always these two paths open 
before me, these two forces tugging at my traitor's heart." 
</P>
<P>
THE LONG GRAY LINE; The American Journey of West Point's Class of 1966 by Rick 
Atkinson (Houghton Mifflin) 
</P>
<P>
As tensions continue in the Middle East, we might all benefit from this 
splendid book by Pulitzer-Prize-winning journalist Rick Atkinson. "The Long 
Gray Line" is a long, poignant reminder of the sad cost of war. In haunting 
prose, Atkinson chronicles the pain and stoicism of the families, and 
especially the boys, of the West Point Class of 1966. And boys they were, 
teen-agers too young for the exercise of informed free will, yet sent on 
missions to Vietnam that many would later consider immoral. This story of West 
Point, where the "rage for order" transforms frightened boys into cadets "eager 
to fight," is a metaphor for the larger national, generational and political 
schism that left us all wiser. 
</P>

AWASH IN A SEA OF FAITH; The Christianization of the American People, 1550-1865 
by Jon Butler (Harvard University Press) 
</P>
<P>
Despite what our cultural mythology has taught us, Puritanism in early America 
was not the single major force that shaped our religious values; instead, from 
the time Europeans began settling New England, American religious life was 
complex and eclectic. Yale professor Butler approaches his subject by 
emphasizing religious beliefs and practices, rather than the formal 
institutions and the elites who run them. As a result, we learn that what most 
early American believers had in common was their desire to begin anew and to 
create their own religion, which most often consisted of a quest for direct 
access to salvation and to the supernatural.

A PEACE TO END ALL PEACE; Creating the Modern Middle East 1914-1922 by David 
Fromkin (Henry Holt) 
</P>
<P>
A panoramic view that attempts to explain the modern Middle East since the end 
of the Ottoman Empire, when the Allies divvied up the area without much regard 
for the religious sensibilities inseparable from nationhood in this part of the 
world. "The Middle East, as we know it from today's headlines, emerged from 
decisions made by the Allies during and after the First World War," Fromkin 
writes. Boundary lines for the new Middle East were arbitrarily drawn on "an 
empty map" without any input from the leaders of those countries themselves, 
says the author of this carefully researched book based on recently opened 
archival material. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SEARCH FOR MODERN CHINA; by Jonathan D. Spence (W. W. Norton) 
</P>
<P>
A passionately told epic of China by Yale professor and historian Spence, 
author of eight other acclaimed works on China. His not-surprising contention 
is that in order to come to terms with China today we need to know about its 
past. The author's dilemma was where to begin in a recorded history that spans 
4,000 years. He decided on 1600 because from that point on there is a 
continuity in customs and practices, meaning that the presence of the past can 
be seen. A "modern" nation, according to Spence, is one that "is both 
integrated and receptive, fairly sure of its own identity yet able to join 
others on equal terms in the quest for new markets, new technologies, new 
ideas." Defined in this way, modern countries existed centuries ago; yet, he 
emphasizes, never has China been one of them. 
</P>
<P>
THE QUEST FOR EL CID; by Richard Fletcher (Alfred A. Knopf) 
</P>
<P>
An illuminating tale of the life and times of Rodrigo Diaz, the 11th-Century 
Spanish aristocrat-soldier commonly known as El Cid. Spain's first great 
national hero emerges as a timeless character motivated by the quest for 
fortune, which he unabashedly sought by whatever bloody means were required. By 
the time of his death in 1099, he had become the independent ruler of a 
principality and the most famous man in Iberia, which accounts for his 
legendary presence in heroic tales to this day. In the masterful account of the 
old hero, Richard Fletcher has both clarified and verified previous research by 
others. 
</P>
<P>
ITALY AND ITS MONARCHY; by Denis Mack Smith (Yale University Press) 
</P>
<P>
A densely packed account of the inner workings of the Italian monarchy, which 
existed only from 1861 until 1946 (under the reign of only four kings), yet 
exerted considerable impact on Italian history -- much of it havoc-producing. 
Written by one of the world's leading historians of Italy, it "assesses the 
kings' influence on the slow and uneven progress of Italian parliamentary 
government, on an adventurous foreign policy that Italy could not afford, on 
the controversial decision to enter the two world wars, and on the 
authoritarian-nationalist experiment of fascism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FICTION 
</P>
<P>
FRIEND OF MY YOUTH; by Alice Munro (Alfred A. Knopf) 
</P>
<P>
Powerful and haunting short stories. Munro's characters inhabit sparse Canadian 
landscapes; they are straightforward and refuse to feel sorry for themselves. 
Their wisdom is quietly ingested, their goodness revealed only through decent 
living. Yet the price they pay for their quiet dignity causes a catch in the 
reader's throat. Tragedy and mystery surround these characters who have no 
resources for the struggle against evil. As one of them says, "You either trust 
or you don't trust, in my opinion. When you decide you're going to trust, you 
have to start where you are." 
</P>
<P>
REACHING TIN RIVER; by Thea Astley (G. P. Putnam's Sons) 
</P>
<P>
Sprawling Australia is the setting for heroine Belle, a fortyish divorcee, the 
love-child of uncommitted 1960s parents, who passionately seeks the order and 
logic she discovered in Euclidean geometry. Belle's own life is shiftless until 
she chances upon a turn-of-the-century photograph of Gaden Lockyer, an obscure 
local dignitary with an interesting face and a shady past. She becomes obsessed 
with moving backward in time to Lockyer's native Tin River, where she 
occasionally sees his phantom image. In his diaries she finds mention of his 
inexplicable sighting of her -- or does she? So successful is this story of 
Belle's loosened grip on reality that we long for her fantasy ourselves and 
ache with loss when Belle's story ends. 
</P>
<P>
LANTERN SLIDES; by Edna O'Brien (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux) 
</P>
<P>
A superb new collection of stories that continue the theme of tragedy that 
intrigues Edna O'Brien. The book's epigraph by Thomas Mann -- "Each human life 
must work through all the joys and sorrows, gains and losses, which make up the 
history of the world" -- is a theme that reverberates throughout her stories. 
There isn't a human situation she shrinks from, whether it is the revulsion of 
a sister when her brother-lover takes a wife or the self-destruction of a woman 
obsessed with a married lover. The title story is the collection's masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
ORDINARY LOVE AND GOOD WILL; Two Novellas by Jane Smiley (Alfred A. Knopf) 
</P>
<P>
Two novellas that explore the hidden territory of marriage and the price that 
must be paid for the choices we make. In "Ordinary Love," 52-year-old Rachel 
Kinsella's current contentment with her life was gained at a cost to her 
children and herself that is only now being tallied 20 years after a brief 
mindless affair, the catalyst for the loss of her snug family. Until this 
summer's reunion with her children, Rachel had not understood what it was that 
made her commit the grand act of self-destruction -- or was it 
self-preservation? -- that cast her out. Now she sees that her husband's 
enthrallment with his family was actually the passion of an egomaniac. Perfect 
happiness, she concludes, "must be accompanied by the inevitable pain of 
knowing it cannot last." 
</P>
<P>
BAOTOWN; by Wang Anyi translated by Martha Avery (W. W. Norton) 
</P>
<P>
This simple, powerful, engaging prose (translated from the Chinese) is the work 
of a young writer who at 16 was sent away from her family for eight years to a 
poverty-stricken northern province of China to fulfill the Cultural 
Revolutionary requirement of intellectuals. Wang Anyi transformed the 
experience into funny and warm stories of the completely human characters that 
make up the fictional "Baotown."

SONORAN DESERT SUMMER; by John Alcock illustrated by Marilyn Hoff Stewart (The 
University of Arizona Press) 
</P>
<P>
Scientific voyeur Alcock has devoted his professional life to the study of 
desert insect behavior. At the "little mountain" an hour's drive from Phoenix, 
he pursues his fascination with the miniature desert life that is the subject 
of his latest book. "Ironically," he writes, "it is the extreme hostility of 
the climate that is responsible for the exotic and intriguing nature of the 
desert's biology." 
</P>
<P>
GREEN RAGE; Radical Environmentalism and the Unmaking of Civilization by 
Christopher Manes (Little, Brown) 
</P>
<P>
With unabashed partisanship and a brash tone, law student and Earth First! 
member Christopher Manes communicates the roots, rationale and methods of 
radical environmentalism. Here is the story behind the daredevil defenders of 
nature who employ attention-grabbing -- and often illegal -- tactics such as 
driving spikes into trees in order to shatter loggers' saws. The premise, of 
course, is hard to argue with: The earth is in dire danger. The point of the 
movement -- and of this book -- seems to be that in any struggle, somebody must 
challenge the status quo by taking the extreme position. 
</P>
<P>
PATENTING THE SUN; Polio and the Salk Vaccine by Jane S. Smith (William Morrow) 
</P>
<P>
Mention the word "polio" and people born before 1950 will emotionally recall 
the summers of their youth when parents were too frightened to let children 
swim in public pools or attend movies. The worst epidemic in U.S. history 
occurred in 1952, when 60,000 new cases were reported. This intriguing social 
history of polio in the United States recounts the quest to develop the vaccine 
that in 1955 dramatically ended those anxious summers. 
</P>
<P>
DISCOVERING; by Robert Scott Root-Bernstein (Harvard University Press) 
</P>
<P>
A fictional approach to unveiling the discovery process. At a colloquium to 
debate the issues that lie at the core of scientific creativity, six characters 
ask themselves: Is there a structure to the process of discovering? Who 
discovers? What kinds of obstacles must discoverers overcome? And what can be 
done to foster discovery? Predictions are made: Great inventions and 
discoveries will take place in countries having expanding economies and which 
accommodate mavericks; mavericks will most likely be trained at new and 
peripheral institutions or will work in emerging fields. 
</P>
<P>
THE CONTROL OF NATURE; by John McPhee (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux) 
</P>
<P>
Three long essays by one of America's finest nature writers defy our notion of 
natural order: It is not nature, even in its worst rages, that is out of 
control, but rather human beings who are out of control in their obsessive 
efforts to control nature. When a subject commands McPhee's attention, he 
engages fully in respectful observation. When he writes, he brings poetical 
description to the previously ordinary. Especially compelling for the Southern 
Californian is McPhee's essay on Los Angeles' debris flows: "The house became 
buried to the eaves. Boulders sat on the roof. Thirteen automobiles were packed 
around the building, including five in the pool. . . . The stuck horn of a 
buried car was blaring. The family in the darkness in their fixed tableau 
watched one another by the light of a directional signal endlessly blinking."

POETRY 
</P>
<P>
WHAT LIGHT THERE IS; And Other Poems .by Eamon Grennan (North Point Press) 
</P>
<P>
Light in these lyrical, meditative poems illuminates the classical themes of 
poetry -- nature, family, love and the contentedness of an uncluttered life. 
These themes act as a counterpoint to anxiety, the knowledge of how "our lives 
hang on balances too delicate to ponder for long." Moments of satisfaction 
come, as in the poem, "Accidents," when "I'm all at once all there" or in 
"Fall," when "On a still morning the shallow pond / Is full of kissing: little 
narcissi . . . " 
</P>
<P>
THE COLOR OF MESABI BONES; by John Caddy (Milkweed Editions) 
</P>
<P>
A searing collection of poems and prose poems that describe surviving a 
childhood of violence. Often framed in the third person, their impact is the 
more powerful for showing us the effects rather than the perpetration of 
violence: "The boy is dreaming in the dark / a metronomic sound that punctuates 
the night with glares of sullen red / It is, slow and strong / the sound of one 
hand slapping some boundary of meat." These are poems that attempt to reach 
back decades to assuage the pain now and to understand: "The doctor slides the 
X-rays from manila. . . . An X-ray syndrome . . . shaken child . . . we can't 
be sure of course." 
</P>
<P>
GRACE NOTES; by Rita Dove (W. W. Norton) 
</P>
<P>
This fourth collection of poetry by the winner of the 1987 Pulitzer Prize in 
poetry is inspired by events in Dove's childhood. Her images are captivating: 
"ant-freckled stones" and "exhausted wives hovering over bins of frozen pork." 
Her poetry is full of lines that can be held and turned over and over like a 
smooth, comforting stone: "If you can't be free, be a mystery" or "Here's a 
riddle for Our Age: When the sky's the limit, how can you tell you've gone too 
far?" or "The Island Women move through Paris / as if they had just finished 
inventing their destinations . . . better not look an island woman in the eye 
-- unless you like feeling unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
GOING BACK TO THE RIVER; by Marilyn Hacker (Vintage) 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Hacker has been the recipient of the National Book Award. Her rhyming 
poetry, which springs from her feminist sensibilities, is playful, 
wisecracking, erotic and devoid of pretense. These compelling poems are about 
love, loss and relationships, in which she combines openness and technical 
mastery of conventional poetic forms. 
</P>
<P>
LEAVING ANOTHER KINGDOM; by Gerald Stern (Harper &amp; Row) 
</P>
<P>
A large collection that spans 15 years, with allusions to philosophers, artists 
and other poets. "Another Insane Devotion" is one of the most moving poems in 
the collection: "Thirty-five years ago I ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms 
/ we were dying together / we never met again / although she was pregnant when 
I left her -- I have a daughter or son somewhere / darling grandchildren in 
Norwich, Connecticut, or Canton, Ohio."

KINGSLEY'S ENGLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Merle Rubin's fulmination against Kingsley Amis -- so rabid as to undercut 
anything objective she might have had to say -- seems to me less her fault 
(after all, she need not like his work; though she has little excuse for being 
so grossly misinformed about him and the critical work done on him). 
</P>
<P>
It was clearly an editorial decision to assign this novel to someone who has 
never liked the particular writer ("overrated"); who clearly . . . pities those 
less adept ("the befuddled middle-of-the-road reviewer"), and who confuses a 
review with an ad hominem attack on the novelist and on all those benighted and 
misguided souls ("liberals whose literary standards are . . . debased") who 
might find him to have talent. 
</P>
<P>
I had dinner one Boxing Day with an ex-wife of Amis (she is a first-rate 
novelist in her own right), and she didn't feel it necessary to attack this 
man. Why, I wonder, does Rubin?

KINGSLEY'S ENGLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The career of Kingsley Amis stands on its own and needs no defense from me. But 
it would be a great loss if readers unfamiliar with it were so put off by 
Rubin's casual (and totally unsupported) dismissal of his life's work in her 
review of "The Folks" that they missed out on such recent delights as "The Old 
Devils," which won the Booker Prize as Britain's best novel of 1986.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE LOST CONTINENT TRAVELS IN SMALL-TOWN NORTH AMERICA BY

</P>

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON

<TEXT>
<P>
Although Bill Bryson was born in Iowa, he's lived much of his adult life in 
England, which enables him to write about the American heartland with both the 
contemptuous familiarity of a native and the bemused curiosity of an outsider. 
His account of driving the highways and byways of the Midwest, South and 
Northeast is very funny, if a bit scatological. 
</P>
<P>
What saves this smart-aleck travelogue from the sniggering cynicism of P. J. 
O'Rourke's accounts of foreign countries is the author's profound love for the 
land and its beauties. A description of the tatty roadside communities in the 
Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee sums up Bryson's attitude: "America has 
never quite grasped that you can live in a place without making it ugly, that 
beauty doesn't have to be confined behind fences, as if a national park were a 
sort of zoo for nature."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: IN XANADU BY WILLIAM DALRYMPLE (VINTAGE: $9.95, 
ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1988, William Dalrymple and a friend set out to retrace the route of Marco 
Polo, from the shrine of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem to Shang-tu, the 
summer palace of Kubla Khan in Inner Mongolia (the Xanadu of Samuel Taylor 
Coleridge). The journal of their 12,000-mile trek across Asia is a highly 
entertaining blend of geography, personal anecdote and history, as the author 
describes various places along their route in both the past and present. 
</P>
<P>
In the most intriguing section of the book, he traces the probable origin of 
the three Magi mentioned in the Gospel of St. Matthew to the Zoroastrian 
observatory at Saveh, in modern Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The accounts of bad food, wretched lodgings, unpleasant weather and overly 
zealous Chinese security officers suggest that much of Central Asia is better 
visited in the pages of a book than in person. Happily, Dalrymple seems to have 
fared better than his model: Polo's tales of the opulence of the Mongol court 
were greeted with such skepticism that a new comic character appeared at the 
Carnival in Venice -- Marco Millions, who regaled audiences with his fantastic 
exaggerations.

<P>
Based on a true incident that occurred in Shanghai in the 1930s, Li Ang's harsh 
tale of domestic violence provoked a storm of controversy when first published 
in Taiwan in 1983. The disinterested relatives of Lin Shi, a passive orphan, 
marry her off to a brutal pig butcher. 
</P>
<P>
Chen Jiangshui proves to be more of an animal than the hogs he slaughters: He 
savagely abuses his unhappy bride, subjecting her to vicious beatings, rape, 
verbal abuse, even deprivation of food. When Lin Shi's mind finally snaps and 
she murders her sadistic husband with his own butcher knife, the people of her 
village refuse to see her as a victim and assume she committed the crime for a 
lover. This powerful indictment of the exploitation and brutalization of women 
throughout the world is less a feminist protest than a humanist one.

ROOKIE MARSTON THE TRIPWIRE IN POLITICAL BATTLE 
</P>

<BYLINE>

By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All rookie Assemblyman Jeff Marston (R-San Diego) ever wanted Friday night was 
to stand up, make a short speech and watch as his legislative colleagues passed 
the first -- and only -- bill of his three-month career. 
</P>
<P>
But before he knew it, the unassuming Marston found himself as the flash point 
in an angry political standoff between fellow Republicans and Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown that was partly responsible for dragging the 1990 session into 
dramatic overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Before it was over -- at 5:03 a.m. Saturday -- rebellious Republicans held $23 
million in mental health programs hostage in Marston's name, the powerful 
Democratic Speaker was forced to beat a procedural retreat, and the lowly San 
Diego Republican became an instant figure of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the tripwire, that's pretty true," an exhausted and bleary-eyed Marston 
said about the night's events. 
</P>
<P>
"All I was trying to do was get the bill out," he said. "The tragedy is that I 
think there have been a dozen Democrats that have come up to me and said, 
'You're being 
</P>
<P>
screwed. We want to help you out but we don't know what to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
What happened to Marston illustrates that even the most routine item can become 
a bizarre exercise in the frantic final days of a legislative session. At 10:15 
p.m. Friday, Marston stood up on the Assembly floor to present the only piece 
of legislation he had authored since narrowly winning a June special election 
to represent the 78th District. 
</P>
<P>
His bill proposed a 20% increase in fines against motorists who park illegally 
in handicap zones, and the extra money would be earmarked to replace $2.1 
million in budget cuts made to a state referral service for the elderly and 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Like many measures pulled out of the air in the waning days, Marston created 
his proposal by amending its language into a second "spot bill" languishing in 
the Assembly. As for all bills drafted this way, he had to make sure that his 
new bill would be deemed germane to the measure it replaced -- in this case 
another proposal relating to the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate on Friday approved it before transmitting it to the Assembly for 
what looked like a slam-dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when the measure arrived in the lower house Friday evening, Brown (D-San 
Francisco) was waiting with a little surprise. The Speaker had set a trap, 
quietly obtaining a legal opinion from the Legislature's counsel declaring the 
Marston bill nongermane. When Marston tried to present the measure, Brown cut 
him off, pointed to the opinion and threw the bill out. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans were stunned. They immediately suspected political motives, 
especially since the Speaker is heavily backing Marston's democratic challenger 
in November, former San Diego City Councilman Mike Gotch. 
</P>
<P>
"They did it for purely political reasons," said Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La 
Habra), Assembly Republican leader. "That's absolutely the belief." 
</P>
<P>
Three sources close to Assembly Democrats also confirmed early Saturday that 
Brown's handling of the Marston bill was politically inspired, an attempt to 
deprive the rookie legislator of any bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuver, however, was to backfire. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the Assembly took up an unrelated bill to restore a $23 million 
cut in mental health programs earlier this year. Under a bipartisan agreement, 
the greatest share -- about $6.1 million -- was earmarked for Brown's own San 
Francisco County. 
</P>
<P>
The catch: Since the measure contained an appropriation, it required a 
two-thirds super-majority for passage -- 54 "aye" votes out of the 80-member 
Assembly. And since there are only 45 Democrats, that meant at least nine of 
the 32 Republicans would have to go along. There are three vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democrats, out of pure meanness, killed a program to help senior 
citizens," said Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale). "And yet the Speaker, after 
doing that blatant political act, wanted us to vote to give most of the mental 
health funds to San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
So when it came time to vote for the Speaker's mental health funds, the 
militant Republicans simply folded their arms and stared off into the night. 
The slight to Marston prompted them to hold hostage the entire $23 million 
mental health package. 
</P>
<P>
And it didn't end there. Seven other measures -- some dear to the hearts of 
other Democrats -- required the two-thirds vote as emergency bills. Sensing the 
growing crisis, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) tried to spring the 
emergency measures by publicly asking Brown to rescind his germane rulings. The 
Speaker summarily refused, thus assuring a deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:15 a.m., the political grudge match deteriorated even further when one 
Republican pointed out that the Assembly couldn't conduct business any longer 
without a two-thirds vote. Brown suddenly declared the session over and soberly 
walked off the podium, leaving Marston and the other lawmakers milling around 
the floor in tired confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Brown) is in a box and he can't get out," Nolan said shortly after the 
Speaker disappeared into his office across from the Assembly chambers. "He made 
a mistake and he kept compounding it and compounding it. Maxine (Waters) 
publicly and his friends privately tried to get him off his petard." 
</P>
<P>
The Marston matter wasn't the only thing holding up the Assembly early 
Saturday. Brown was waiting for nearly $3.3 billion in bond proposals to be 
sent over from the Senate -- proposals that also required two-thirds votes. 
</P>
<P>
While the fate of the bonds were not directly tied to the Marston stalemate, 
Nolan and others indicated they were somehow bound up in the gestalt of the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the scenes, prominent Democrats approached Brown and gently urged him to 
defuse the political hostilities, say the Democratic sources. Among the 
visitors was Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco), whose district also 
would have lost mental health funds, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a plan began to take form. Everyone would forget the Marston bill 
that was ruled not germane earlier in the evening. Instead, the language would 
be crammed into yet another spot bill lingering in the Senate, waiting for a 
second chance. 
</P>
<P>
The solution seemed ideal: A proud Brown would save face by not having to back 
down publicly. Marston would save his only bill. And the Republicans would stop 
the legislative blockade with their abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious we had to find a way for a graceful exit," Assemblyman Tom 
Hannigan (D-Fairfield) acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative staff members were dispatched to search computer records for a 
suitable recipient of the Marston bill, while the rookie legislator walked 
around the Assembly floor nervously, largely unaware of the effort to help him 
save face. 
</P>
<P>
By 2:20 a.m., a visibly relaxed and jovial Brown once again called the lower 
house to order and asked for a two-thirds vote to resume the deadlocked 
session. The Republicans delivered as part of a 62-3 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The political logjam had been broken. When the Speaker asked for a 
reconsideration of the $23 million mental health package, it passed with a 
resounding 72-0 vote. Assembly members also began working on pieces of the bond 
package. 
</P>
<P>
By 3:40 a.m., the tenseness in the Capitol seemed to give way to relief. Down 
the hall from the Assembly, Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) stood up before his peers 
to present Marston's measure. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happened in the Assembly, I have a bill to correct it, or at least 
the feelings," he smiled, clutching the revived Marston bill. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia) jumped up. "Well, let's kill it and see what 
happens," he said to peals of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Maddy continued, "I wish to amend this bill to include the author to be Mr. 
Marston, which I think is the most important part." The knowing crowd roared 
again. 
</P>
<P>
With minimal debate, the Senate voted 34-2 to pass Marston's measure once more 
at 3:50 a.m. Three minutes later, the bill was whisked into the Assembly 
chambers and its newest member rose and finally got his chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank all of my colleagues for their indulgences and respectfully 
request an 'aye' vote," Marston said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Brown, who had earlier quashed the measure, declared it passed by a 
unanimous 77-0 roll call. 
</P>
<P>
The irony: No one even had to push a vote button. 
</P>
<P>
After Brown finally gavelled the 1990 session to a close at 5:03 a.m., he 
maintained that his initial ruling on the Marston bill was correct. 
</P>
<P>
"The Marston bill was a pure, unadulterated nongermane measure," he said. "You 
have to absolutely respect the rules. You play around with the rules, you 
rewrite the rules for your own purposes, and it becomes a process by which the 
system totally breaks down. 
</P>
<P>
"Pure and simply, that's all it was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the vote, Marston admitted he didn't know what bill was plucked from 
the Senate to salvage his measure. It was a bill pertaining to sexual battery. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought the new spot bill was germane, Marston managed a grin. 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't sound like it was," he said.

KEEPING GETTY MUSEUM GARDENS IN SHAPE IS NO WALK IN THE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Michael DeHart oversees the irises at the J. Paul Getty Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Not Van Gogh's famous painted ones that hang inside, but the splendid living 
ones that grow in three of its five Roman-style gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The late oil tycoon hated the modern concrete-bunker school of museum 
architecture. Instead, he decided to build a Roman-style villa based on a real 
villa that was buried in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79, to house his 
collections. From the beginning, plants that might actually have grown by the 
sea in Imperial Rome were part of Getty's eccentric grand plan for Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Like its classical model, the Getty has its topiarii, as the Romans called 
their master gardeners, to nurture its plants. But Getty gardeners have 
concerns their Roman counterparts never dreamed of, including making sure the 
plants are historically appropriate and saving water in a California drought. 
</P>
<P>
DeHart, 29, is the museum's new horticulturist. A graduate of Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, he did a stint among the topiary Goofys and Snow Whites of Walt Disney 
World, installing plants for special events, before joining the Getty in April. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Brentwood, DeHart arrives at the Getty every weekday morning at 
7. His first duty is to walk all five of the gardens, clippers and notebook at 
the ready, scrutinizing the evergreens, flowers and other plants for evidence 
of droop, trampling and other vegetative crises. Hundreds of species of plants 
grow on the 60-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
A Roman-style garden is feasible in Malibu because the climate is so similar to 
that of the Italian coast. Herculaneum, where the model for the museum, Villa 
dei Papiri, stood, was even earthquake-prone. Caesar would feel right at home 
with the olive and fig trees at the museum, the oleanders, bays and myrtles, 
the beds of sweet mint and sharp-scented rosemary. There are also pink damask 
roses, one of DeHart's favorites, despite their tendency to develop powdery 
mildew in the damp air. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about as fragrant as any rose I've ever smelled," he says. "It's a rose 
the way roses were before they were played with." 
</P>
<P>
After inspecting his charges, DeHart alerts the gardening staff of 15 (11 in 
winter) to any horticultural emergencies. He reduces the complex tasks of 
keeping a world-class garden lovely year-round to a series of work schedules. 
</P>
<P>
DeHart, who has loved horticulture since he tended African violets and worked 
the family kitchen garden as a child, says there are multiple satisfactions to 
the job. There are the sensual pleasures of working in a beautiful place by the 
sea. There is the joy of problem-solving, experienced recently when he found a 
safe pesticide to zap the white fly that has been plaguing the pomegranates. 
</P>
<P>
And there is the satisfaction of grappling with concerns unique to horticulture 
at the Getty. 
</P>
<P>
Take the irises. Most of the irises in the museum's main peristyle garden (the 
large rectangular area that runs forward toward the ocean from the display 
galleries) are what DeHart calls "Van Gogh blue." They are both the shade of 
the flowers in the museum's most famous acquisition and the color of the 
species form of the plant, which the ancients knew and named after the goddess 
of the rainbow. But the garden also has burgundy-colored irises, a modern 
variety developed after 1800. The red irises are lovely, but as anachronistic 
in the classical Getty gardens as a digital alarm clock. They are slated for 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
The authenticity of the gardens is important to the Getty, which is why there 
is no bougainvillea despite the fact that it thrives both in Southern 
California and modern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The gardens are more than a setting for the Getty's antiquities. They are a 
context, and the staff labors to make them as accurate in their own way as the 
museum's display signs. The catch is that no one now knows exactly what a Roman 
garden was like, although there are clues in ancient frescoes, classical 
writings and archeological remains. Dennis Kurutz, a Pasadena landscape 
architect who designed the gardens in the early 1970s and now serves as a 
consultant to the museum, says the accuracy of the plantings are an ongoing 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
He cites the main peristyle garden as an example. Based on his research, he 
says, "I made the assumption that Roman gardens would have been very structured 
and ordered." As a result, the garden has symmetrical rows of bay laurel trees 
that might have been cloned and carefully balanced boxwood hedges on either 
side of the central pool. 
</P>
<P>
But he has since learned from archeologists that the Romans included impulsive 
touches in their gardens, not unlike modern gardeners who fall in love at the 
nursery Sunday afternoon and have to have some pretty plant, symmetry be 
damned. "Those gardens wouldn't have been quite as structured as that," says 
Kurutz, who is exploring ways to add calculated spontaneity to the peristyle 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
Other refinements are under consideration. Roman gardeners liked to train and 
trim plants into artificial shapes, called topiary. They would sometimes spell 
out their names in boxwood hedges -- a kind of living graffiti -- and they 
recreated battle scenes and chariot races in their greenery. The Getty decided 
to stick with simple geometric topiary when the gardens were installed, Kurutz 
says, in part because Getty was still alive and had given no indication that he 
was going to endow the institution as lavishly as he did. But now more 
ambitious topiary shapes, lions perhaps, could be phased in. 
</P>
<P>
Accuracy doesn't always triumph, even at the Getty. Paths that would have been 
simply packed dirt in ancient times were paved to protect museum objects from 
dust. And Kurutz had hoped to see the villa surrounded with Roman-style 
meadows, not the lawns, as manicured as golf courses, that now exist. He even 
specified appropriate plants for the meadows, including that old Roman 
favorite, the dandelion. He says the public has complained whenever the museum 
has experimented with letting an area get authentically scruffy, often with 
barbed remarks about the institution's having enough money to mow the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Authenticity is always on DeHart's mind, as he circumambulates the gardens. In 
choosing plants, he says, he asks himself three questions: Is it Roman, when 
does it bloom and how thirsty is it? Knowing a plant's blooming cycle is the 
key to keeping the gardens perennially attractive. And drought resistance is 
both a horticultural and a social issue. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring, the museum called for a cutback on water use. DeHart was asked 
to trim 10%. By cutting back just over 20% on water for hillsides and other 
non-museum areas, he has enough to keep the five museum gardens, which are 
hand-watered, looking their best. 
</P>
<P>
Propagation of plants is one of DeHart's most important duties, not only to 
save money but because many of the varieties are not readily available in this 
country. DeHart says he had never even seen a medlar -- a small tree that 
produces bitter, apple-like fruit -- until he arrived at the Getty. After the 
museum's two medlars finish fruiting, he'll take tip cuttings in hopes of 
multiplying them. 
</P>
<P>
Modern scientific horticulture is only part of the picture for DeHart. In the 
half-ancient world in which he gardens, plants are one of life's essential 
mysteries, food for the stomach, the eye and the mind. Old beliefs live on, 
particularly in the herb garden, a favorite with visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Herbs had religious significance for the Greeks and Romans and were also valued 
as cures. Garlic, for instance, was thought to be an aphrodisiac and to ward 
off snakes. 
</P>
<P>
The staff is allowed to do some restrained harvesting in the herb garden. "They 
keep the basil in check," says DeHart, who is brought the occasional gift of 
pesto by a grateful colleague. Getty-raised dill sometimes appears in dishes 
served in the museum tea room. 
</P>
<P>
There are moments on the job, DeHart says, when the classical world seems more 
real to him than Southern California, with its smog, traffic and other 
not-so-civilized discontents. 
</P>
<P>
"At 7 o'clock in the morning, when no one is here and there's nothing to 
distract me, it's easy to think of what this must have been like when slaves 
were doing this work and there was just one family living here -- one very rich 
family."

ABORTION FOES TO HARASS S.D. JUDGES; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: RELIGIOUS GROUP PLANS CAMPAIGN OF CALLS AND PROTESTS AIMED AT HOMES 
AND OFFICES OF JUDGES WHO RULED AGAINST ABORTION PROTESTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A national anti-abortion group affiliated with Operation Rescue has targeted 
eight judges in San Diego County and 18 others in California for picketing, 
rallies, protest letters and telephone calls in what they say is the first 
organized effort to pressure jurists who have ruled against abortion 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
The group, known as the Christian Defense Coalition and based in Washington, 
has distributed more than 500 pieces of mail that list the 26 judges. The 
coalition, of which Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry is an active member, 
includes the judges' work telephone numbers, work addresses, names of those 
sentenced in abortion protests and a sentencing summary. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say California is the first of many states whose judges they will 
identify for protests and was selected because they believe anti-abortion 
protesters -- particularly those in the San Diego area -- have been unduly 
punished. 
</P>
<P>
Terry said the coalition is ready to stage any type of nonviolent protest, 
including the mass publication of judges' home addresses and home telephone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Among San Diego judges, the coalition's primary target is El Cajon Municipal 
Judge Larrie Brainard, who sentenced anti-abortion attorney Cyrus Zal to 290 
days in jail on contempt-of-court charges last February. Zal began serving his 
sentence two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Brainard has been the target of repeated protests even before the sentencing. 
His former home was picketed in May. And his office has been swamped with 
hundreds of protest letters and telephone calls on Zal's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that he may have to face a new stream of attacks brought about 
by his appearance on the list does not please him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an ill-advised tactic," Brainard said Monday. "These people don't 
accept the fact that I'm a minor magistrate expected to uphold the law. 
Abortion is legal, and that is the fact." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Brainard, the group has included El Cajon Municipal Judges Richard 
Bein, Eddie Sturgeon, Elizabeth Riggs and Victor Bianchini. San Diego Municipal 
Judges John Thompson, Ann Winebrenner and Michael Orfield also are on the list. 
</P>
<P>
The group has targeted nine judges in Los Angeles County and nine in Northern 
California. All of the judges have sentenced abortion protesters to jail. In 
many cases, the judges offered probation in plea negotiations, but many of the 
protesters refused because they would have had to agree to refrain from repeat 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Several Los Angeles-area judges interviewed last week said they have noticed an 
increase in protest telephone calls and letters, some of which included threats 
to report them to the state Commission on Judicial Performance. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a novelty to me," said Los Angeles Municipal Judge David S. Milton, 
who is on the list. "To go so far as to threaten a complaint with the Judicial 
Performance Commission is unfair." 
</P>
<P>
It is highly unusual for a political group to try and intimidate a judge once a 
decision is made, according to Warren Conklin, a San Luis Obispo superior court 
judge and president of the California Judges Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin said he could not recall a similar protest effort. 
</P>
<P>
"The position of the judiciary is that it's absolutely inappropriate to target 
a judge for a decision he or she may have made and subject that judge to 
harassment," Conklin said. "A judicial decision is not part of a public 
give-and-take." 
</P>
<P>
More than 220 people were arrested in three San Diego-area abortion protests 
earlier this year. The cases all have been resolved, with most serving either 
minimal jail sentences, agreeing to probation or accepting public service 
assignments with anti-abortion groups. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Duffy, who heads the coalition's office in Washington, said 
anti-abortion organizations in California developed the list for a radio 
broadcast on Christian stations Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong program, called "With Justice for All," featured members of 
various Christian groups and focused on what they believed was unfair treatment 
of anti-abortion advocates before California judges. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said the show, broadcast on 50 to 60 stations throughout the state, 
encouraged callers to phone an 800 number and request the list of judges who 
they said displayed "outrageous and tyrannical behavior" in dealing with 
abortion protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation with Brainard was one of the situations that gave us the impetus 
to forming the coalition," Duffy said. "Seeing his behavior shocked a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition distributed about 500 copies of the California judge's list, he 
said. Duffy said California judges were the first to be targeted, but other 
such listings will be made in other areas of the country where the coalition 
spots problems. 
</P>
<P>
Brainard said he was not aware of the list but assumed he already was on some 
mass-mailing because of the hundreds of phone calls and letters he has received 
since shortly before Zal's sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Although Brainard sentenced Zal in February, anti-abortion protesters still 
picket outside the El Cajon courthouse nearly every day. Protesters visited his 
home in May, but Brainard had not lived at that address for about two years. 
His ex-wife still lives there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brainard said he still gets five to a dozen letters each day and several 
telephone calls, few of which are complimentary. He said protesters are within 
their legal right to picket him, but he objects to any visits or calls to his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"The fear I have is that, while most of these people are decent, there could be 
a lunatic fringe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brainard said he could not tell if the list had generated a greater volume of 
calls and letters than before. 
</P>
<P>
Other judges on the list interviewed Monday said they had not received the 
letters or telephone calls that the listing encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I on that list?" asked Orfield, who heard the cases of nine protesters, two 
of whom asked for jail time. "I tried desperately to talk those people out of 
jail time. All they had to do was refrain from similar activity or to do public 
service." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition described Orfield's courtroom behavior as "manipulative" and said 
he gave "irrational lectures which expressed his pro-abortion views." 
</P>
<P>
Orfield said the coalition's description is inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept my mouth shut," he said. "I didn't allow long, protracted speeches at 
the time of sentencing but I didn't say anything either." 
</P>
<P>
Winebrenner, who heard the cases of 99 protesters who had been grouped together 
under three separate abortion clinic protests, "appears more rational towards 
defendants, reducing jail time and allowing community service with pro-life 
organizations," the coalition said. 
</P>
<P>
Told of her appearance on the list, Winebrenner said she understands the 
protesters' position. 
</P>
<P>
"They sincerely believe that judges are legislating from the bench," she said. 
"They feel judges are giving their own opinions and not granting fair trials." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's list includes nine judges in Los Angeles County. Eight are 
municipal judges in Los Angeles and one a Van Nuys municipal judge. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge J. Stephen Czuleger, whose name appears on the list, said he 
has noticed an increase in letters and calls to his office in recent weeks 
chiding him for sentencing protesters to jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I assumed I was on some sort of list because the calls and mail have picked up 
in the last couple of weeks," he said. "They're all the same tone: they compare 
my sentences to Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg trails." 
</P>
<P>
Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, formed the coalition in June with two 
Florida ministers -- the Rev. George Grant of the Coral Ridge Ministries in Ft. 
Lauderdale and the Rev. Patrick Mahoney of the Center for Christian Activism in 
Boca Raton -- to fight public officials, including judges, police officers, 
prosecutors and politicians who they believe have mistreated them. 
</P>
<P>
The group has yet to file its incorporation papers, Terry said, or to fully 
disclose its membership or board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a pattern of tyrannical, godless judges over the past year who 
either are caving in to pro-aborts or who simply don't fear God," Terry said in 
an interview last week from Operation Rescue's headquarters in Binghamton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Terry said San Diego is one of the worst areas in the country for abortion 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"The judges in San Diego and Southern California right now are making political 
prisoners of our people," he said. "We are preparing a network of churches and 
Christian organizations for a quick strike because these judges are still 
accountable to the voting electorate and to God." 
</P>
<P>
Terry said the coalition is especially angered at Brainard, who cited Zal 20 
times for contempt of court during last February's trial. Zal was defending 
anti-abortionists who had staged a protest last October at the Family Planning 
Associates clinic in La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
In its summation of Brainard, the coalition says he sentenced Zal to more than 
nine months in jail for "using 'forbidden' words or concepts, including 'God or 
deity in any form', 'abortion' and 'killing.' Over 40 words and concepts were 
forbidden." The coalition says Brainard can release Zal any time he wants. 
</P>
<P>
Brainard said the summary is untrue, and that he cannot release Zal. He said 
the contempt charges had nothing to do with Zal using any particular word, but 
rather for leading an emotionally-laced line of questioning that bordered on 
harassment.

"For example, he asked a receptionist in the doctor's office (of the clinic) on 
the stand how it felt to have blood on her paycheck," Brainard said. "He went 
way beyond using a couple of words. He knew what he could say. He directly 
violated my court orders."

MANY USE CAMPSITES AS WELCOME REFUGE DURING HARD TIMES 
</P>

Though she loves the outdoors, Mary Cox never imagined she would be camping 
this Labor Day weekend. Especially since her camp-out began 10 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst off we've ever been, though I don't feel like we need 
anyone's help," said Cox, 26, who lives with her husband and two children in a 
small trailer in Camp Comfort near Ojai. "But this is as far as our money took 
us." 
</P>
<P>
The Coxes are one of an estimated 200 struggling families and as many 
individuals who live full time in one of the county's 40 private and public 
campgrounds, according to Ventura County homeless advocates. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say most are like Cox, who works as an insurance company 
secretary in Ojai, making $1,700 a month but whose family cannot afford to move 
into permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
Not that outdoor living is cheap. Campsites cost from $270 to $600 a month 
depending on hookup service fees. And the families have to uproot themselves 
frequently and move to the next campground on the circuit because stays in the 
various parks are limited to from seven to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Parks officials said the limits are intended to ensure that campsites are 
available for recreational campers and not to discourage transient campers. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these people are at an in-between status" in their lives, said Blake 
Boyle, head of Ventura County Recreational Services. "The vast majority are 
good citizens and good campers." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, state and county beach campsites were packed to capacity by pleasure 
campers, many of whom had reserved spots last spring for Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Campers who were turned away from coastal campgrounds filled inland parks near 
capacity. In many cases they set up alongside transient campers, who frequent 
inland campgrounds with longer stay limits. 
</P>
<P>
The Coxes were camped on one of 15 sites at Camp Comfort, occupied Saturday by 
otherwise homeless people. They landed in the county park after gang violence 
prompted them to move last year from Bellflower in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't go out wearing this shirt I have on," said Cox, who at that time 
was renting a $750-per-month apartment. "It's red, a gang color. I wouldn't be 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who had been earning nearly $40,000 a year, decided to move to 
Oregon. They quit their jobs -- she as a word processor and he a school 
groundskeeper -- and spent $5,300 on a used pickup and trailer. Within two 
months, they exhausted their savings and hit the road with less than $100, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cox pays a $13 daily campground fee and moves to Lake Casitas Recreational Area 
one day a month to meet the park's requirements. Her husband has done sporadic 
odd jobs but has been unable to find permanent work. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Barbara Warfield said raising children at a campground is difficult but 
preferable to a tenement. "It's become a little bit like a neighborhood here. 
The kids are very special since they are out playing with Mother Nature and not 
running in gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bongard, his wife and two children have lived for a year in a trailer in 
Dennison County Park near Ojai. Bongard's family must move after Labor Day 
because the county did not renew its lease with the park's private operator, 
Larry Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
David Jensen, who manages the park for his brother, said he and his brother did 
not enforce a 30-day limit and permit transient campers to stay indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't see why these people had to live like . . . hobos, and force them to 
move out for a day," said Jensen, whose 36 sites cost $10 a day. "A lot of 
times people didn't have the money to pay. We didn't toss them out. We let them 
work it off." 
</P>
<P>
Bongard, 49, is among those who worked for his rent. His family is by no means 
destitute now, he said, since his wife works and he finds temporary employment. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Lake Casitas Recreation Area changed its stay limits last year, as 
many as 150 of the 300 sites were taken up at times by people who could not 
afford normal shelter, said Doug Ralph, assistant park supervisor. Of the 
families living outdoors, as many as half were housed in tents. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies occasionally had to be called in to quell domestic disputes 
set off by the tension of living in tight quarters, Ralph said. But the 
problems were but a small percentage of the group, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Since the tighter restrictions were imposed, no more than 10 sites are 
generally taken up by transient campers. 
</P>
<P>
Myron Schoenfelder, a truck mechanic, has been living in campgrounds for the 
past four years with his wife and children after the three-bedroom Ventura 
house they were renting for $400 a month was sold. 
</P>
<P>
Myron, 35, and his wife, Mary, 33, accepted a broken-down bus from a friend. 
After overhauling the engine, creating a rear bunk bedroom for their children, 
installing a kitchen and bathroom and setting up a bed for themselves behind 
the driver's seat, the Schoenfelders lived for two years in various county 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenfelder, an independent mechanic, said work has been steady for more than 
a year, which has allowed him to move his family into the Ventura Beach R.V. 
Resort, where rent runs $600 a month, including pool privileges and other 
amenities. He probably could afford to move into an apartment, he said, but is 
holding off because of a planned move to Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Living in a bus, we do really well, since we have no utility bills or 
anything," said Mary Schoenfelder, who provides home instruction to her three 
children, ages 7, 9 and 11. "If the kids need shoes, we can afford them." 
</P>
<P>
Cox, whose son starts kindergarten on Tuesday, hopes that she and her husband 
will be able to save enough money to resume their trip north. But savings are 
hard to come by, even when living frugally outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"You get in a place that's tough to get out of," Cox said.

SPRAY-CAN VIGILANTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Graffiti artists wielding spray-paint cans can be the scourge of a neighborhood 
and vigilantes considered dangerous to a well-ordered society. But there exists 
a combination of both in the Mt. 
</P>
<P>
Helix area worthy of some commendation. I refer to the lovable scoundrels who 
consistently obscure with spray-paint the small advertising billboards 
periodically erected along roads like Fuerte Drive by subdivision promoters. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Helix is a uniquely beautiful area heavily wooded with magnificent trees, 
flowering shrubs and colorful hillsides. The homes that dot the slopes, from 
mansions to cottages, complement the natural beauty with caring maintenance and 
lush landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
What could be more of an affront to the residents than erection of commercial 
billboards along their winding, tree-shaded suburban roads? The eyesores don't 
stay for long, of course; after a few nightly spray-paint jobs, the advertisers 
give up and pull them down. 
</P>
<P>
As a law-abiding citizen, I certainly can't condone the work of spray-can 
vigilantes . . . but anyway, thanks, guys!

SAVING ON SEWAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the battle of numbers about the possible costs involved with the 
implementation of San Diego's secondary sewage treatment system, it's easy to 
be dazzled by the smoke and mirrors of official pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors recently received a report looking into the 
actual costs involved in this proposed system. 
</P>
<P>
When the financing costs are included, it is clear that the amount is easily 
double the $2.8 billion figure, or $5 to $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
If federal requirements are changed to allow new chemical methods to be 
incorporated, there will be no need to undergo the massive capital costs 
involved with building a secondary treatment facility using biological 
oxidation methods. 
</P>
<P>
If the capital costs of adding biological oxidation methods are 35% of the $2.8 
billion -- hence a savings of nearly $1 billion -- and if we add the savings in 
financing costs, the amount of money saved to the rate payers is at least $1.6 
billion.

AIRPORT SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("Lindbergh Needs a Short-Term Fix," Aug. 26) is right on target 
in suggesting that making plans to expand Lindbergh Field to 24 million people 
would derail the effort to relocate our commercial airport. Nothing derails 
faster than a complex political solution effort. 
</P>
<P>
Too many of today's leaders are falling victim to the same old obstacles that 
have prevented an airport solution for 40 years. We need some vision in this 
city of ours. Although the majority of the City Council voted to expand 
Lindbergh, that doesn't change the fact that Lindbergh can't cut it as a 21st 
Century airport. No consultant has been able to craft a plan that will 
adequately deal with capacity, safety, and noise issues at Lindbergh, because 
it cannot be done. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for us to recognize that Sandag's recommendation for a binational 
airport is a good one and should be seized upon by our community. Not only can 
a binational airport meet the criteria for capacity, safety, and noise 
requirements, but it has the potential to help our two countries better deal 
with existing border related problems. 
</P>
<P>
We can start to build a solid consensus by demonstrating to the Mexican 
government the mutual benefits to be derived by both countries, and reject 
short-term agendas of politicians who are currently trying to derail their own 
regional council of governments' wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to you, L.A. Times, for staying on track and trying to convince our 
elected officials to do likewise. And thanks also to members of Sandag's 
committee who have met with officials in Washington, D.C., and will soon meet 
with representatives of Mexico. Thanks for not turning your backs on San Diego 
and showing courage and vision in your pursuit of the airport answer. We're 
glad you can all see beyond the year 2000.

FARRAKHAN RAPS BUSH ON OIL INTERESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan equated President George Bush with a 
"warlord" Saturday, saying that the "vital interest" and reason for the U.S. 
presence in the Middle East was oil. 
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan, speaking to reporters at a press conference in San Diego, said he 
hopes it is not "the intent of Mr. Bush and the warlords to destroy Saddam 
Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
The outspoken Chicago-based minister said the deployment of more than 50,000 
U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia could present that country with long-term social 
problems because Muslims worldwide are afraid that Western values could replace 
Saudi mores and laws, which are derived from the Koran. 
</P>
<P>
"The Muslim worry is that the American lifestyle will change Saudi (Arabia) 
forever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a Muslim and I do not want to see Saudi Arabia turned into a bloody 
battleground," he added. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would withhold further comment on the U.S. deployment to the Middle 
East until after returning from a visit to Saudi Arabia, which begins in a few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan, who preaches the teachings of the late Elijah Muhammad, began the 
press conference with remarks about the violence among blacks in America's 
inner cities -- "black on black" violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Although black people account for 12% of the population," he said, "they 
account for more than 50% of (murder victims)." 
</P>
<P>
"Black leaders, black teachers, and black politicians have to be concerned 
about this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has figures that show more blacks will be killed in inner-city 
violence in the next two years than the entire number of blacks who died in 
Vietnam during a nine-year period there. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that while a white man in America stands a 1 in 186 chance of 
being murdered in a lifetime, the corresponding figure for a black male is 1 in 
21.

REFLECTIONS: 'FLYING FEELS SO FREE, SO LIBERATING. YOU'RE TOTALLY 
SELF-SUFFICIENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Terry Rather, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego State University journalism professor January Riddle received her 
license to fly in 1983. Riddle, 46, mainly a recreational flier, had previously 
competed in only two small-scale races. But when the opportunity to fly in the 
Air Race Classic, the Super Bowl of women's aviation races, arose this summer, 
she teamed with experienced pilot Sally Bocinski. They borrowed a Cessna 172 
for the 2,600-mile, four-day journey that took the racers to obscure airports 
in New Mexico, Kansas, Arkansas, Illinois and West Virginia before ending in 
York, Pa. Riddle, a member of the 99's, an international organization for women 
pilots founded by Amelia Earhart, is now preparing for a 500-mile, one-day race 
later this month. Riddle spoke with Times staff writer Terry Rather and was 
photographed by Bob Grieser. 
</P>
<P>
It was wonderful being with all those accomplished women pilots. The race was 
never scary but was very intense, more so than I thought it would be. 
</P>
<P>
It's not like getting in a plane and leisurely going somewhere. Every minute 
you're concentrating on not getting off course, making sure the plane is flying 
at full capacity every single second, and watching the weather. It takes all of 
the skills that you ever learned and tests them every single moment. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the race was a thrill. It was a staggered start with airplanes 
taking off every 10 seconds. At the beginning of the race, no one talks to you. 
But, after you've flown, people say, "You're still here, you didn't flake out, 
you're still with us." Then you become part of the group. It's a special group, 
and it becomes an important part of your life. 
</P>
<P>
The airplane we had was one of the slowest allowed in the race, so we were 
actually in the air seven to eight hours a day. It took us three days to finish 
the race. So it was three days of getting up at 4:30 in the morning. That was 
the killer. We had to be able to take off at the first possible minute because 
our airplane was so slow, and we had to land by sunset. 
</P>
<P>
I had never flown east of Arizona or north of Oregon, so I had a very small 
scope of what flying is like. There were 48 other planes, and no one had to fly 
at a certain altitude. You just watched what you're doing because it's up to 
you. It always is. The ultimate responsibility is with the pilot in all 
situations. But these races are surprisingly safe. The record for women's air 
races is very good. There were no crashes or injuries in this race, even though 
the possibility and potential was there. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing the race was an incredible experience. It was very challenging and 
very rewarding. The only thing I can compare winning that race to would be like 
getting an Oscar. It is the absolute, the ultimate, to say you won that race in 
that kind of competition. We finished 33rd, which is reputable. We were happy 
we did that well. 
</P>
<P>
Flying feels so free, so liberating. You're totally self-sufficient, really 
relying on you and your machine. I feel so fortunate to be able to do this. 
</P>
<P>
When I first started flying, I took a lot of kidding from the guys. There 
weren't a lot of women at that time taking lessons at that club. A lot of women 
who learn to fly do it because their boyfriends or husbands fly, not because 
they want to. There's a difference. That made me a little unique, because I 
wanted to fly. 
</P>
<P>
I always wanted to fly, but there was always something, like college or the job 
or husband and kids. Women tend to do that, put off their own dreams in favor 
of others. I found myself looking at my 40th birthday, so I decided now it's my 
turn, now I'm going to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Flying is really great. When I get a little crabby, my friends ask me how long 
it's been since I've flown. "You haven't flown in a while, have you?" My 
friends can tell when I haven't flown. 
</P>
<P>
It's an addiction. Anything that makes you feel so good makes you want to keep 
doing it. I'm amazed that people can learn to fly and not keep doing it. I 
can't even imagine that. It would be so painful to not be able to do that 
anymore. Flying adds an entire new dimension to your life.

LONG WAIT FOR WW II REPARATIONS ALMOST OVER; 
</P>
<P>
INTERNEES: AS PAYMENTS, WHICH WERE AUTHORIZED IN 1988, COME CLOSER FOR 
JAPANESE-AMERICANS WHO WERE RELOCATED FROM 1942 TO 1946, THE REASONS BEHIND THE 
INTERNMENTS STILL TOUCH A RAW NERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN M. ROSE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruce Kaji remembers his 16th birthday particularly well. It was May 9, 1942. 
Carrying all the clothes and belongings he could from his family's Boyle 
Heights home, Kaji boarded a train that day with his two sisters and parents 
under the watchful eyes of U.S. soldiers who distributed box lunches for the 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
Although they weren't even told their destination at the time, the Kajis were 
headed to Manzanar, a World War II internment camp where thousands of 
Japanese-Americans were held against their will from 1942 until 1946. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so scared that we burned everything that had Japanese writing on it -- 
all my father's books and newspapers," said Kaji, who now runs a real estate 
firm with his son in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kaji and about 350 other Japanese-Americans crowded into Gardena's 
Japanese Cultural Institute to find out more about the U.S. government's plan 
to recompense about 65,000 surviving victims of wartime internment by awarding 
them each $20,000. In all, 110,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry were held in 
the camps. 
</P>
<P>
Although former President Reagan signed the bill authorizing the payments in 
August, 1988, former internees have yet to receive a dime. The funds, which 
have been blocked by congressional budget battles, are expected to be released 
over a three-year period starting in October. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's meeting, the Justice Department's Robert Bratt, who heads the 
office in charge of the reparation payments, explained the documentation and 
the forms that must be completed in order for internees and their families to 
receive payments. 
</P>
<P>
Bratt said he accepted an invitation to speak in Gardena because a large number 
of Japanese-Americans who qualify for the reparations live in Gardena and 
elsewhere in the South Bay. About 3,900 of those eligible for the payments are 
from the South Bay, 2,700 of them from Gardena, Bratt said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury-issued checks are meant to "acknowledge and apologize for the 
fundamental injustice of the evacuation, relocation and internment," according 
to Justice Department leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
But for the hundreds who attended the Gardena meeting, the internment and now 
the reparation payments had varying meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Kaji stressed the symbolic significance of the government's actions. "The 
payments are important not just for the recipients, but also for the perception 
and understanding of the public. In our society, if there was a wrong committed 
and it is to be righted, there has to be money attached to it." 
</P>
<P>
Michiko Ohye, 63, said she felt slightly embarrassed to be taking the money. 
"Why aren't other people, like the American Indians, getting money?" the 
Gardena resident said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been so confusing. We are still carrying the burden of those memories," 
added Ohye, who was sent to a camp in Poston, Ariz., at the age of 13 with her 
parents and sister. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 years after the fact, the reasons behind the internments remain a 
topic of debate that touches a raw nerve with both Japanese-Americans and other 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's meeting, a white Capitol News Service reporter sent angry 
whispers running through the crowd when he referred to some of the internees as 
"enemy aliens." Later, a brief fistfight broke out between the news service 
reporter and an angry Japanese-American who interrupted the reporter's 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Former internees pointed out that more than half the Japanese-Americans who 
were detained during the war were born in the United States and were American 
citizens. Most of the others were resident aliens, Japanese immigrants who 
never had been given the opportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship because of 
racially biased laws that blocked naturalization for those of Japanese 
ancestry. Those laws were eventually overturned in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan is a foreign country to me. The U.S. is my country," said Kaji, who was 
born in Los Angeles. "The day after Pearl Harbor, I was delivering newspapers. 
A few days later, on Friday, the circulation guy says: 'You can't sell anymore. 
You're Japanese.' I said, 'I'm what?' Nobody had ever called me that before." 
</P>
<P>
Kaji, in fact, left Manzanar in 1945 to join the U.S. Army, and he served as a 
linguist in the postwar American occupation forces in Japan and the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, 
created in 1980 by President Carter, determined that the internments were not 
justified militarily and that the decision resulted from "race prejudice, war 
hysteria and a failure of political leadership." 
</P>
<P>
That study recommended that the government, which had paid $37 million in 
property-loss claims filed after the war, make additional amends, which 
prompted the reparation payments now being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Checks will be issued first to the oldest people qualifying, Bratt said. The 
first round of payments this year should cover former internees 70 and older, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Children and relatives of those people who have died since the bill was passed 
two years ago are entitled to the payments too, Bratt added. 
</P>
<P>
Bratt was deluged Friday with questions from dozens of people about their 
personal situations. 
</P>
<P>
Ohye, for instance, is entitled to a payment herself but asked about her 
father, who passed away three months ago and would have been entitled to a 
$20,000 payment. Ohye was adopted by him as an infant, and she wanted to know 
what proof she needed for the government to split the money between her and her 
half sister. 
</P>
<P>
Others wanted to know what documentation was required to show that their family 
evacuated the West Coast specifically to avoid the mandatory internments. Under 
the legislation, those individuals are also entitled to the funds. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the scuffle at last week's meeting, most Japanese-Americans questioned 
said they felt sadness about what happened but little bitterness. Some, like 
Ohye, noted that the camps protected them from harassment they would have 
surely faced from other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all mentioned that the America of those years was much different in its 
assumptions about other races and countries. "Looking back over the years, 
there's a kind of feeling of guilt from having gone into camp," Kaji said. 
</P>
<P>
"My children ask me: 'Why didn't you protest? Why didn't you raise your voice?' 
We were devoid of any power in the society then. They put us in a position of 
pawns and pushed us however they wanted to. Society then was different."

OJAI POST OFFICE BELL TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
* HISTORY: San Diego architect Richard S. Requa designed the domed, four-story 
Spanish tower after the campanile over Christopher Columbus' tomb in Havana. It 
was built in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
* LOCATION: 201 E. Ojai Avenue in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
* HOURS: The tower is closed for viewing, but the post office lobby is open 
24-hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-foot bell tower of the Ojai post office tolls every hour between 8 a.m. 
and 9 p.m. and peels out patriotic tunes at noon on amplified Westminster 
chimes. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny door to the spiral staircase is locked to all except volunteer 
bellkeeper Billie Powers, a local contractor, who has kept the chimes tolling 
over Ojai for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
The local Altrusa Club raised funds to donate the chimes in 1969. The effort 
began after city officials decided that a city employee might not be able to 
ring the old fire bell promptly every day at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Historian Patricia L. Fry says that after the post office was built in 1917, 
the town's fewer than 500 residents changed its name to Ojai from Nordhoff, 
fearing their mail would go to Norwalk by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
On June 30, 1975, the Ojai Post Office tower and sidewalk portico became 
Ventura County Historical Landmark No. 26, along with an old sycamore tree in 
Libbey Park nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Drummond Libbey, Ohio glass magnate who spent winters in Ojai, donated 
the civic park. He hired Requa in 1914 to design a series of other prominent 
Spanish-style buildings for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ojai has never had its own postmark, with its current daily average of 
55,000 pieces of mail routed through Oxnard, its fiesty community spirit has 
often reached officials in Washington. In 1893, Nordhoff set two national 
precedents by staging an independent selection of its postmaster and by 
allowing women to vote in his election, 27 years before the 19th Amendment 
granted women's suffrage. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, a petition signed by 1,005 Ojai Valley residents urged postal 
officials to reconsider their plans to move out of the small building. A dozen 
citizens lent money to expand it. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight years later, Ojai Postmaster John Wolfard said he feared he would 
be lynched for supporting renewed efforts by postal officials to build another 
building with more mail-room space and employee parking. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a petition of 2,447 signatures demanding the post office be kept 
under the tower, the Ojai City Council persuaded state and federal lawmakers to 
leave the downtown office with 1,530 rental boxes where it remains.. 
</P>
<P>
"They run into a lot of their old friends and socialize while collecting their 
mail," Wolfard said of his patron's passion for the 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the building's trustees, the Ojai Civic Assn., is negotiating a 
long-term lease with the U.S. Postal Service to keep the lobby open at least 
another 10 years. The association uses the current $55,000 annual rent for 
improvements to Libbey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The post office tower and portico, built of unreinforced masonry, are also on 
the city's list for mandatory earthquake reinforcement. THIA BELL

REWARD URGED AS WAY TO CURB GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to reduce graffiti, Oxnard City Manager Vern Hazen has recommended 
that the City Council offer a reward of up to $250 for anyone who reports and 
helps apprehend graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was made in a memo to the City Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi had asked the staff last month to investigate how to reduce 
the proliferation of graffiti in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the mayor's request, Hazen and representatives of the city 
attorney, police, Public Works Department, Parks and Recreation Department and 
Code Enforcement Department met early this month to discuss options. One of the 
suggestions was to charge property owners for the cost of removing graffiti 
from residences and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Among other ideas for reducing graffiti, staff members suggested that the city 
adopt an ordinance that prohibits the sale of aerosol paint to minors. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals to reduce graffiti will be discussed by the City Council sometime 
in the next three weeks, according to the memo. HUGO MARTIN

RED SOX SEEM TO BE HAVING FUN FOR A CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON HEYMAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BOSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once staid and often surly, for years the Red Sox were known as a team without 
personality. The Paul Revere statue down the road had as much life as Red Sox 
players. You want fun, go to Faneuil Hall. You want base hits, come to Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
Boy, are times a changin'. No longer a group of businessmen with attache cases 
and foul outlooks, the Red Sox actually seem to be enjoying themselves. What's 
more, they even seem to like each other. 
</P>
<P>
"The old stuff about 24 cabs for 24 players is far from the truth now," Mike 
Greenwell said. "It's one cab, 24 players. If we could all get in one cab, we 
would. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we had a lot of the old school. They'd go out and do a job and that's 
it. They were not rah-rah types. We have a little bit of a college atmosphere 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Together, they are in first place, well ahead of the Blue Jays. Together, they 
are joking and laughing, probably all the way to the playoffs. Greenwell is 
behind some of the fun, along with recent imports Tom Brunansky and Tony Pena. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the Red Sox have a kangaroo court. It's an old baseball 
tradition whereby fines are instituted for goofball mistakes, on and off the 
field. The Red Sox may be the last team to have instituted one. 
</P>
<P>
When they change, they really change. On Aug. 11, the Red Sox engaged in the 
ultimate battle of rally caps, the silly baseball superstition in which players 
wear their caps wrong; it's supposed to ignite the offense. The Red Sox won 
that game, 3-2, in Seattle's Kingdome on Dwight Evans' home run in the 13th 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important to them, Greenwell claims the rally-cap battle was won, too. 
"We cut holes in the caps and put shaving cream all over our faces," Greenwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwell, who instituted the court, introduced a seance-like atmosphere in 
Milwaukee July 24 when he held "a candle ritual" in an effort to revive sagging 
Red Sox bats. Greenwell placed the bats in a darkened clubhouse, then put 150 
candles in a circle and lit them. Also present was a rubber chicken. 
</P>
<P>
It was weird, but it worked. The Red Sox hitters are doing almost as well as 
their pitchers. There's the other change. Red Sox pitchers, formerly a 
necessary evil, are this team's strength. Of course, there's Roger Clemens 
(20-5). But it's not Roger, over and out anymore. Mike Boddicker (13-8) is a 
solid No. 2 pitcher, but hardly anyone expected they'd also get contributions 
from Greg Harris, Tom Bolton and Dana Kiecker. 
</P>
<P>
Holding the Red Sox back in the early going was their offense. They are at or 
near the bottom of the league in stolen bases and home runs, a deadly 
combination that has been overcome by their league-leading .274 batting 
average. Last week, they pitched three straight shutouts against the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the Blue Jays possess more talent, but Ellis Burks said, "Up and down 
the lineup, we're the best team." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of his teammates agree. Evans said, "If you were to write our team and 
their team on a piece of paper, I think I'd take their team." 
</P>
<P>
Not that this team is without ability. Far from it. Wade Boggs, Evans and 
Clemens are potential Hall of Famers and Greenwell and Burks are All-Star 
quality, at least. Togetherness would be nothing without talent. As Boggs 
pointed out, "You could have 25 Peter Pans where everyone sleeps together and 
still not win. You still have to cross those white lines."

THIGPEN RELUCTANTLY TIES RECORD FOR SAVES; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HIS 46TH FINISHES ANGELS, 9-5, AFTER THE CHICAGO BULLPEN FALTERS IN 
THE LATE INNINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Happy as he was to tie Dave Righetti's major league record with his 46th save, 
Bobby Thigpen would have preferred to have the afternoon off. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got the best setup guys in the league, I guess," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Or the worst, because Chicago's bullpen turned a laugher into a drama that left 
Manager Jeff Torborg drained and Thigpen with a share of the save record. 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded and the Anaheim Stadium crowd of 29,491 imploring the 
Angels to rally, Thigpen started a double play by snaring Dave Winfield's line 
drive and finished it by doubling Pete Coachman off first, clinching a 9-5 
victory that etched his name in the record books and cut Chicago's American 
League West deficit to 5 1/2 games after Oakland's 3-2 loss to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more worried about the game than anything else," Thigpen said, after 
watching bullpen mates Scott Radinsky and Kenny Patterson fail to protect a 9-2 
lead. "It's a nice feeling, but I'd rather have won by 9-2 or whatever the 
score was when Melido (Perez) left." 
</P>
<P>
Perez (12-12) held the Angels to two runs and seven hits over seven innings and 
benefitted from a Chicago offense that included three runs batted in each from 
Scott Fletcher and Ozzie Guillen and Carlton Fisk's 350th home run. Angel 
starter Joe Grahe (1-2) defeated the White Sox last Sunday at Comiskey Park, 
but on Saturday he was rocked for six runs in three-plus innings. 
</P>
<P>
"This on-the-job training is tough," said Grahe, a rookie right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels made it a tough day for the White Sox by batting around and 
producing three runs in the eighth, an inning highlighted by RBI singles by 
Coachman and Luis Polonia and a bases-loaded walk by Rick Schu, just recalled 
from triple-A Edmonton. It had all the signs of duplicating a rally the Angels 
staged against the White Sox on June 26 at Anaheim Stadium, when they overcame 
a 9-1 deficit to pull even before falling, 11-9, and Torborg didn't like any of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry until the last out," said Torborg, too emotionally and physically 
spent to rise from his chair in the visitors' clubhouse and peel off his 
sweat-soaked uniform. "I can't believe it. We were talking in the dugout, 
Carlton and Sammy Ellis (the pitching coordinator) and I, about it being the 
same ballpark, the same score. It was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Torborg resorted to Thigpen for the third consecutive game with one out in the 
ninth inning after Jack Howell reached first when Patterson missed a flip from 
first baseman Steve Lyons on an easy grounder and Ron Tingley walked on a 
3-and-2 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Thigpen induced Coachman to ground to third, but Robin Ventura bobbled the 
ball, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Like Thigpen, Fisk's concern centered on ending the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't care about the record. I wanted to get it over with. I'm too old to 
be doing this," Fisk, 42, grumbled in mock anger after the 3-hour, 39-minute 
contest. "He's the guy to end it. . . . He's almost (tied the record) in 
obscurity. Nobody's made a big deal -- not the media, not anybody. There's a 
month to go and he's tied the record. The guy's been incredible all year. Sure, 
he's blown a few, but everybody's done that. I'd hate to see how far behind the 
A's we'd be without him." 
</P>
<P>
There would be no need to measure that distance if not for Thigpen's success, 
according to Torborg. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be nowhere without him," Torborg said. "We've won 18 two-run games 
and 26 one-run games. We've scratched and clawed for everything because we 
don't have a big bopper. Our pitchers are young and inconsistent and he's the 
constant, as Ozzie is on the field and Fisk is behind the plate. He's the guy 
we hang our hats on." 
</P>
<P>
Thigpen might not have had anything to hang his hat on if he hadn't reacted so 
quickly to Winfield's line drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was hit that good, but everybody else said it would have 
taken my head off," he said. "I saw it all the way off his bat. I caught it -- 
I didn't stab it -- and made the play. Then I danced around looking for a base 
to throw to. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had the record when Psycho (Lyons) finished the double play. You know 
things like that. I knew coming in that if I got a chance I could do it, but 
you can't think about things like that when you're pitching. Those guys out 
there are going to try and knock your head off." 
</P>
<P>
He's still most interested in knocking off the A's. "We have to pick up games 
wherever we can. We can't lose too much ground anymore," he said. "When they 
lose, we've got to win; and when they win, we've got to win. I plan on getting 
a lot more (saves)." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the Angels activated catcher Ron Tingley, pitcher Greg Minton and 
infielder Kent Anderson off the disabled list and recalled infielder Rick Schu 
from triple-A Edmonton. All four got into Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Schu, who was sent to Edmonton on Aug. 14 when Bob McClure was activated, drew 
a bases-loaded walk in the eighth to force in a run and stayed in the game in 
left field after Lee Stevens was ejected for arguing a strike call with home 
plate umpire Derryl Cousins. Jack Howell finished the game at first. 
</P>
<P>
Howell was two for four and is seven for 18 (.389) since his recall from 
Edmonton last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Minton pitched a perfect ninth inning in his first appearance since July 8 at 
Milwaukee and first at Anaheim Stadium since April 17. . . . Devon White, ill 
with the flu, was a late scratch from the starting lineup. Max Venable was 
inserted in center field, his first start since Aug. 21. . . . Brian Downing's 
eighth-inning single ended an 0-for-16 slump that covered parts of five games. 
. . . The Edmonton Trappers open a best-of-five playoff series against Tacoma 
Wednesday in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Every Chicago starter had at least one hit.

FRENCH MEN SET A WORLD RECORD IN 400-METER RELAY

<P>
The French national team broke the world record in the men's 400-meter relay, 
and East German sprinter Katrin Krabbe became a triple gold medalist at the 
European Track and Field Championships Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The French team of Max Moriniere, Daniel Sangouma, Jean Charles Trouabal and 
Bruno Marie Rose was timed in 37.79 seconds, breaking the record of 37.83 set 
by the United States at the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Krabbe was the only triple gold medalist of the championships. After winning 
the 100 and 200, she ran the second leg on the 400-meter relay, which was timed 
in 41.68. 
</P>
<P>
The East German women also won the 1,600-meter relay in 3:21.02, with the 
Soviet Union second in 3:23.34 and Britain third in 3:24.78. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5,000 meters, Salvatore Antibo of Italy, winner of the 10,000 meters 
Monday, collided with Marcus O'Sullivan of Ireland at the start and fell. 
</P>
<P>
It took Antibo several laps to make up the 40 meters he lost in the mishap. The 
crowd cheered Antibo as he continually closed the gap and began pulling away. 
When he came around the final bend sprinting to victory, the crowd gave him a 
standing ovation.

MIKE DOWNEY: WHEN JUDGING AGASSI, DON'T PUT THE BART BEFORE THE HORSE

He dresses like a rodeo clown and has been known to have the subtlety of a 
steer. The other day he gritted his teeth and spat in the direction of a U.S. 
Open tennis official, catching him with the spray, and also demonstrated his 
sympathy for a fallen opponent, writhing in pain while his bare ankle was being 
taped, by peeling off his own shoes and hurling them into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Could Andre Agassi really be as awful as all this? 
</P>
<P>
Could he be the guy who brings "tennis bum" back into the vernacular? 
</P>
<P>
Is Andre Agassi actually more like Andre the Ghastly? 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not if you judge this book by more than its shabby, slobby cover, 
keeping in mind that Agassi's work clothes are also ornamented by charms and 
medals conveying his devotion to God, or that the very player whose behavior 
sometimes seems so piggish and selfish also happens to be the player who 
volunteered for Davis Cup duty and speaks with what sounds to be sincerity 
about "doing something for my country." 
</P>
<P>
True, the guy goes his own way. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what America's about," Agassi says in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
Those exposed to his profanity of last Thursday might argue the concept of free 
speech. On the other hand, a negative word would not be heard from any of the 
bulging-eyed children who mobbed Agassi at courtside here Saturday, after his 
straight-set, no-sweat disposal of the far more dignified but far less colorful 
Franco Davin. 
</P>
<P>
To them, Andre is a giant, a forecourt jester, a heavy-metal tennis player with 
blond scalp hair, black facial hair, a two-inch earring, a seriously baggy 
jersey and long shorts under short shorts, who, given half a chance, would 
probably play Wimbledon in a Bart Simpson T-shirt and high-top shoes with the 
laces undone. 
</P>
<P>
We followed a few steps behind him down a Flushing Meadow hallway to see what a 
typical few minutes with the off-stage Agassi might be like. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody spat at him, that's for sure. 
</P>
<P>
A little girl howled for his shirt as a souvenir, but was too far away. He gave 
her a wave. A not-as-little girl called down: "How about your towel?" Agassi 
obligingly flung it up to her. 
</P>
<P>
"So, you a big Andre fan?" we asked Erin Gallagher D'Eletto of Long Island, as 
she squeezed and inspected the towel like a woman in a detergent commercial. 
</P>
<P>
She said: "I am now." 
</P>
<P>
Such admirers could be his for the taking. He could be bigger than big, this 
ground-stroking floor show from Las Vegas. Andre Agassi could be the superstar 
American tennis player many have been hungering for since John McEnroe and 
Jimmy Connors put their best smashes behind them. He could be the endorsement 
darling of men's tennis that Madison Avenue has been needing, what with Ivan 
Lendl, Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg being demographically or geographically 
undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
Except . . . 
</P>
<P>
He won't play Wimbledon, which lowers his profile, and he won't conform, which 
alters his image, and he won't behave, which makes him out to be some sort of 
snot-nosed McEnroe wanna-be who hasn't much else in common with Mac except an 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
The $3,000 fine Agassi was slapped with Friday for trying to become the 
spitting image of McEnroe did little more than cause Andre to insist that his 
tantrum only happened because official Wayne McKewen of Australia had it in for 
him -- as if such paranoia, real or imagined, would excuse spitting and 
swearing and other public behavior so vile. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't feel I have to be on my best behavior from now on," Agassi said. 
"Yes, I said a lot of things I regret. Yet the more I thought about it, the 
thing that made everything snowball was that official giving me a warning when 
I didn't deserve it. That's what escalated the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
"When they overruled his warning, I saw him roll his eyes. He was looking to 
give me a warning. Maybe I went too far, sure. But I just don't need somebody 
in the chair who has something personal toward me. If we'd had somebody else in 
the chair, the whole incident never had to happen," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
What seems to elude him, naturally, is that Andre Agassi is an incident waiting 
to happen. 
</P>
<P>
At least he is easy to pick out of a crowd. Maybe this is why Agassi travels 
with an entourage the size of Saddam Hussein's. As tennis players go, he sticks 
out like a sore elbow. His fashion statement is sort of surfer-terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
The clothes, well, while Andre doesn't exactly wear tennis whites, he hasn't 
ruled out wearing them for Davis Cup or even for next year's Wimbledon, which 
he claims to be considering playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I never said I'd enjoy wearing white," Agassi said. "I never said I wouldn't, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
As for his beard, well, that's new. "I might just wake up one morning and it'll 
be gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Magically? 
</P>
<P>
"Nah. In the middle of the night, I might shave it off. Depends how I feel. I 
just do things to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
"Not for people's sake. For my sake." 
</P>
<P>
That's Andre Agassi in a nutshell. You never know if he should go to the net or 
if somebody ought to be chasing him with one.

The Big East Conference is considering expansion to add football and, 
potentially, such new members as Miami and West Virginia, league and school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Only three of the nine Big East schools -- Syracuse, Pittsburgh and Boston 
College -- play major-college football, and those three have been approached by 
others to form an Eastern Seaboard Conference, along with Miami, West Virginia, 
Rutgers, Temple and Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse, Pittsburgh and Boston College are expected to approach the other 
league members within the next two weeks to talk about adding at least three 
schools.

BATTERED RAMS, GREENE COME TO TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a day when two defensive starters underwent knee surgery and the prospects 
for the upcoming season looked bleak, the Rams ended a long summer of financial 
bickering and signed linebacker Kevin Greene to a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed, although Greene said Saturday night he did not get 
the $1 million per season he had sought. The Rams had been offering $750,000. 
It is believed the two parties split the difference. 
</P>
<P>
To say the signing was the act of a desperate team would not be overstating the 
issue. The Rams, who left Washington late Friday night with 17 key players 
either injured or holding out, could feel a season of projected promise 
slipping away before it started. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, who has 33 sacks the past two seasons, more than any other NFL player, 
said he watched the team's loss to the Redskins Friday night on television and 
decided that the stalemate must end. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, who spent the night carrying players off the field in stretchers, 
obviously concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt anxious," Greene said. "We needed to get it done. We're hurting, and 
the Rams felt a sense of urgency." 
</P>
<P>
Greene and his agent, Marvin Demoff, met with Rams General Council Jay Zygmunt 
at a Marina Del Rey restaurant Saturday. Three hours later, Greene signed his 
contract at the team's Los Angeles offices. 
</P>
<P>
"We just hammered it out," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
Greene denied that his signing was triggered by New Orleans Saint linebacker 
Pat Swilling, a player of comparable value who signed earlier this week for a 
reported $1.7 million over two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We negotiated on Kevin Greene's worth," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
He will join the Rams at Monday's practice and play in next Sunday's season 
opener against the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
Greene joins a team -- a defense in particular -- that has been decimated by 
injuries. Cornerback Jerry Gray and linebacker Larry Kelm underwent knee 
surgery Saturday and will miss four to six weeks. Starting corner Darryl Henley 
is out indefinitely with a hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve cornerback Alfred Jackson, who strained his groin in an end-zone 
collision with Gray, is also out for an extended period. The team's entire 
inside linebacking corps -- starters and backups -- also is injured. 
</P>
<P>
Starting defensive end Doug Reed and safety Michael Stewart remain unsigned.

A federal court document supports former New York Yankee general partner George 
Steinbrenner's claim that he paid gambler Howard Spira $40,000 to keep damaging 
allegations against Cincinnati Red Manager Lou Piniella a secret, the Plain 
Dealer of Cleveland reported. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said a transcript obtained from federal court records in 
Cleveland indicates Spira had said Piniella made bets on college and 
professional football games while he worked for the Yankees. Piniella has 
denied betting on anything but horse races, which is legal. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent concluded that Spira, who is facing eight 
federal charges of extortion relating to the Steinbrenner payment, was lying.

DICKERSON WILL APPEAL TO TAGLIABUE

Running back Eric Dickerson claimed Saturday he never was warned by the 
Indianapolis Colts he would be put out of action for six weeks if he refused to 
take a physical. He also said he will appeal the action to NFL Commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
"I never refused to take a physical, I never used those words," said Dickerson, 
who missed three scheduled physicals and was suspended. "My hamstring is fine. 
I feel I could play right now." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, the NFL's seventh-leading all-time rusher, said he was not warned by 
General Manager Jim Irsay he would be given such a lengthy banishment if he 
left without undergoing an exam. 
</P>
<P>
"If he (Irsay) had said, 'Take the physical or we suspend you,' I would have 
probably taken the physical," Dickerson said. "But he never said that, not 
once. Normally, they use this (inactive) list for people with major injuries. 
All we're talking about here is a hamstring." 
</P>
<P>
Irsay said Dickerson was "told about the consequences" of not taking the 
physical. "He was told directly," Irsay said Friday night.

<P>
RACING: INGLEWOOD BASED BIG CITY RACING TEAM IS BECOMING A FORCE IN MOTORCYCLE 
RACING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ted Lumpkin, the ultimate organizer, and Big City Racing teammate Alex White, 
stood on the sidewalk next to a motorcycle shop on Artesia Boulevard in Redondo 
Beach and talked about their love for motorcycle racing. 
</P>
<P>
Lumpkin and White, together with Chris Young and backup rider Dave Brown, will 
return to Willow Springs International Raceway in Rosamond (Calif.) on Sept. 
22-23 for what could be the most important race in the history of their 
fledgling endurance team. 
</P>
<P>
Founded by childhood pals Lumpkin and Young, the Inglewood-based motorcycle 
club, with a pit crew of four, will be making a bid to capture the national 
endurance title of the Western Eastern Racing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Currently ranked sixth, few expected Big City Racing, in its first year on the 
tour, to be in contention in the 640 c.c. Mediumweight Superbike class because 
the team has not had enough funds to compete in every race nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
It costs Lumpkin, White and Young about $10,000 each to compete in about half 
of the yearlong series of races. Still, by choosing to race their Yamaha FZR 
600 in events that offer double points, they have stayed in the hunt and 
climbed as high as second. The Willow Springs race is a double-point event and 
a good finish there might attract additional sponsorship monies. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been doing very well," WERA President Kurt Hall said. "Being based 
in California, they have been at a disadvantage because they have so far to 
come to a lot of the races. And when they get here they don't know the track, 
so the other racers have the edge. But for being so far out West, they have 
done well." 
</P>
<P>
Just doing well isn't why Big City Racing was founded, Lumpkin said. To prove 
it, the team's motto, emblazoned on much of its gear is "In It to Win It." 
Lumpkin boldly calls it "our winning attitude." 
</P>
<P>
"Big City Racing wins championships through ingenuity, efficient organization 
and talent," Lumpkin said. "Two of our members have won individual 
championships and, as a team, we (have already won a title)." 
</P>
<P>
Big City Racing burst onto the endurance scene in 1989 by winning the 
California Endurance title of the American Road Racing Assn. Endurance 
competitions consist of two types: sprints and endurance. 
</P>
<P>
Sprint races range in distance from 25 to 100 miles and racers reach speeds of 
up to 180 m.p.h. Endurance races run from three to 24 hours in length, covering 
as much as 2,000 miles along a twisting, turning asphalt track. Engines 
sometimes turn 12,000 revolutions per minute and consume as much as three 
quarts of oil. Teams of riders, wearing leather jumpsuits, often trail knees 
and thighs along the track in tight turns. Riders are often subjected to 
temperatures of over 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"At times, they literally carry riders off bikes because of heat exhaustion," 
Lumpkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The object in each race is simple: Beat your opponent to the finish line. The 
machines these guys are racing aren't street hogs popularized in epic biker 
movies like "Easy Rider." 
</P>
<P>
"Motorcycles have a stigma," White said. "Many people think we're all Hell's 
Angels, but that's not the case. This kind of racing, most of the people are 
more upper middle class, an educated crowd." 
</P>
<P>
But according to John Winslett, general manager of Del Amo Motorcycles in 
Redondo Beach, most racing teams fail to promote themselves as well as they 
should. That is what sets Big City Racing apart from the others. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys (Big City) are articulate," Winslett said. "They're not like the 
normal racer. They're a little older and they know what they are doing. Other 
racers are very focused on racing, but not much else." 
</P>
<P>
Lumpkin, an aircraft tool design engineer, won the ARRA Heavyweight Twins 
championship last year. At 29, he is a senior statesman for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"At my age, I'm considered over the hill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A smooth talker with an eye toward organization, Lumpkin is a public-relations 
director, secretary, bookkeeper and rider rolled into one. He seeks out 
sponsors and wants to expand the team's competition schedule by raising more 
money to race in events east of the Mississippi River, where WERA hosts most of 
its races. 
</P>
<P>
White, 27, a motorcycle technician, is the most decorated of the crew. He has 
held four individual titles in three separate racing categories. He is a master 
mechanic and might have a lucrative future working in Europe, where road racing 
events pay big money. But if he goes overseas, it's likely he would work as an 
engine tuner, not a racer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always fiddling," he said. "I'll spend eight hours working on an engine, 
just to get an additional half-second of time out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Young, 27, a computer installer, built his first racing bike from what Lumpkin 
called "a hunk of metal." He started his racing career by riding a Kawasaki 750 
which he "bolted together from spare parts and scrap metal," White managed a 
top-10 finish in the ARRA Superstreet class in his rookie year in 1985, but has 
yet to win a title. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had the bike pretty much sorted out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a major race the following year at Riverside Raceway, Young was "so 
confident that as I pulled up to the starting grid I was mentally deciding 
where my trophy would look best in my house." 
</P>
<P>
When the starting flag fell, Young let out the clutch. But instead of getting 
off the line quickly, all of the teeth on the rear sprocket were sheared off. 
Young traveled six feet. 
</P>
<P>
"As I sat there watching the rest of the field disappear into turn one, I 
thought to myself, 'This is what they mean when they say that's racing,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 25, was picked up by Big City Racing in October after another driver, 
Mike Strawder, resigned from the team to spend more time with his family. An 
Illinois native, Brown turned pro as a dirt-bike racer at 17, but quickly found 
"I couldn't afford to live." He met Lumpkin, White and Young at Willow Springs 
a year ago. Brown is the team's signal man and races occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Lumpkin and Young grew up together near Los Angeles International Airport. As 
kids they raced bicycles through the streets of their neighborhood. As 
teen-agers they took to motorcycles, Chris on his homemade Kawasaki and Ted on 
a used Yamaha. 
</P>
<P>
White, also from Los Angeles, began to work with motorcycle engines as a youth 
and by 21 had won his first individual title, the ARRA Lightweight Class 
24-hour race at Willow Springs. As a teen-ager, his favorite spot was cruising 
Mullholland Drive. He lived for a street race, but in 1982 he was involved in a 
collision with a police cruiser. He went over the handlebars of his secondhand 
Honda 350. Bruised, but not seriously hurt, White turned to the track. 
</P>
<P>
Winslett, known to the racing crowd simply as "J. W.," calls Big City Racing 
"our primary endurance team." He likes the team because "they race good and 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
In all, Lumpkin counts about a dozen businesses as sponsors. Most, like Del 
Amo, which sponsors 41 racers, provides discount parts and services in exchange 
for advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Price breaks are nice, Lumpkin said, but the barter system only pays a part of 
the bills. He hopes to move Big City up to the Heavyweight racing class next 
season, which could increase the team's costs by about $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
It's a lot of money, but Lumpkin said that if he had to mortgage his own home, 
he would do it. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "This is not just a hobby. This is serious."

SOUTHERN SECTION CROSS-COUNTRY TEAMS FACING INEQUITABLE END TO SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern Section did the right thing when it regrouped the divisions at its 
cross-country championships to reflect those at the state meet. But the state's 
largest section (482 high schools) went too far by dividing those divisions in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, 12 teams qualified for the finals in each of the 4-A, 3-A, 2-A and 
1-A Divisions (both boys and girls). 
</P>
<P>
In the new setup, 12 teams will compete for the Southern Section Division I, 
II, III and IV titles -- the top four teams in each qualify for the state meet 
-- but each division will be subdivided into six-team A and AA categories, 
which are based on student-body populations. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Division II in the State and Southern Section meet is for schools 
with 1,526 to 2,025 students. But in the Southern Section, there are Division 
II-A (1,776-2,025 students) and Division II-AA schools (1,526-1,775). 
</P>
<P>
Under this format, Hart High -- with an enrollment of 2,000 -- is a II-A 
school, while Crescenta Valley -- with 1,600 students -- will compete at the 
II-AA level. 
</P>
<P>
There are several potential problems with this arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
A team theoretically could finish seventh in the Division II finals, yet still 
win the II-AA title. 
</P>
<P>
A team could finish fourth in the Division II finals -- thus qualifying for the 
state meet -- but fail to win a trophy because it was fourth among II-A 
schools. In another scenario, a team could finish fifth overall -- failing to 
qualify for the state meet -- but still win the II-AA title and be awarded a 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that if teams are competing in the same race in a sectional 
championship, they should be competing for the same prize. 
</P>
<P>
To have half the teams competing for one title and half for another is 
confusing to fans and unnecessary. It has the potential to lessen the 
accomplishments of some very good teams and individuals while rewarding the 
lesser accomplishments of others. 
</P>
<P>
That shouldn't happen in cross-country, a sport whose appeal lies in its 
simplicity. Whoever crosses the finish line first wins. If someone fails to 
win, he or she should not be regarded as a champion. 
</P>
<P>
Fall prognostication: With the cross-country season beginning shortly, it's 
time to make predictions about a pair of area standouts. 
</P>
<P>
First, senior Darcy Arreola of Cal State Northridge will place in the top 10 in 
the NCAA Division I championships in Knoxville, Tenn., in November. 
</P>
<P>
With All-American honors going to the top 25 United States citizens, Arreola 
will become the first Northridge cross-country athlete to earn Division I 
All-American honors since 1978, when Julie Brown finished 12th in the Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women's meet in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
The Division II cross-country champion last year, Arreola should have no 
problem making the transition to Division I. 
</P>
<P>
The second prediction involves Dave Hartman of Canyon High. Hartman will earn 
All-American honors by finishing in the top 15 in the Kinney national 
championships in San Diego in December. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman, sixth in the 1989 state Division I cross-country championships, ran 9 
minutes 6.28 seconds in the 3,200 meters during the 1990 track and field season 
and is finally healthy after injury-hampered sophomore and junior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming event: Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande and Hartman, the top two 
returning cross-country runners in the state, are expected to meet in the 
Seaside Invitational at San Buenaventura State Beach in Ventura on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Quintana placed second in the state Division I cross-country championships and 
third in the Kinney national meet last year. During track season, he ran 
4:07.20 in the 1,600 meters and placed second in the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia question: Which Valley-area high school has produced the most sub-9:05 
two-milers? 
</P>
<P>
Honor roll: With the 1990 high school track and field season having officially 
ended Friday, recognition is due those local athletes who ranked among the top 
10 in the state in their respective events.

Former Agoura High standout Bryan Dameworth, who will compete this season for 
Wisconsin, and Agoura senior Deena Drossin led the state in the boys' and 
girls' two-mile, and Marion Jones of Rio Mesa was second in the girls' 100, 200 
and 400. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth ran a national-leading 8:53.26 to win the 3,200 in the state 
championships and Drossin won the girls' race in 10:29.60. 
</P>
<P>
Those times convert to a 8:56.38 two-mile for Dameworth and a 10:33.28 clocking 
for Drossin. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth also ranked third in the boys' mile (4:09.32), and Drossin was fifth 
(4:56.44) in the girls' mile. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who won state titles in the 100 and 200 as a Rio Mesa freshman, had 
bests of 11.62, 23.70 and 54.21 in the 100, 200 and 400. 
</P>
<P>
Other local athletes who broke into the top 10 were Ruben Benitez, who as a 
Taft junior ranked eighth in the 400 (47.89), and Birmingham's Brian Gastelum, 
who ranked fourth in the mile (4:11.33) as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the two-mile, Eliazar Herrera of Hoover (9:02.12), Abe Valdez of 
Camarillo (9:04.16) and Obed Aguirre of San Fernando (9:04.28) -- who competed 
as seniors -- and Hartman (9:09.48) ranked third, fifth, sixth and eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell Hill of Taft, a senior last season, was ninth in the long jump at 23 
feet 9 inches, and Patrick Van Scoy of Rio Mesa, then a junior, ranked fourth 
in the shotput with a 59-3 3/4 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Nikki Shaw of Fillmore, a sophomore last season, ranked 10th in the 800 meters 
(2:12.98) and seventh in the mile (5:00.82), and Taft's Sarah White, then a 
junior, was 10th in the high jump at 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Arrington of Palmdale, then a senior, was fourth in the girls' shotput 
(44-11 1/4) and seventh in the discus (144-0). 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa's relay teams, anchored by Jones, were sixth and 10th in the 400- 
(47.07) and 1,600-meter (3:53.20) events. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Led by national high school record-holder Jeff Nelson (8:36.3 in 1979), the 
school has produced four sub-9:05 two-milers. 
</P>
<P>
The others are Lin Whatcott (9:01.9 in '79), Kevin Burkin (9:02.8 in '76) and 
Scott Schweitzer (9:04.4 in '71).

BLAME IT ON 'LA BAMBA'; 
</P>
<P>
IN RECORDING ITS NEW 'THE NEIGHBORHOOD' ALBUM, LOS LOBOS WRESTLED WITH 
QUESTIONS OF ARTISTIC PURITY AND COMMERCIAL COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There's no success like failure and failure's no success at all," Bob Dylan 
wrote more than 25 years ago, capturing the ironic nature of these powerful but 
unpredictable forces. Depending on how they are handled, success can often lead 
to failure, and failure can spur one on to success. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Los Lobos has taken so long to record the true follow-up to its 1987 
album, "By the Light of the Moon," is that the East Los Angeles-spawned quintet 
has been dealing with questions of success and possible failure. At stake: the 
group's artistic purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"Moon" was a dark, moving series of tales about the troubled pursuit of the 
American Dream, seen inescapably through a barrio perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably the most culturally arresting and musically embracing work by a Los 
Angeles-based group in nearly a decade, the graceful, warm-spirited collection 
sold a respectable 400,000 copies and was named to the year-end Top 10 lists of 
numerous critics. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "Moon" was almost totally eclipsed in the public mind by the runaway 
success a few months later of Los Lobos' next recording venture: four songs for 
the soundtrack of "La Bamba," the film biography of '50s Los Angeles Latino 
rock star Ritchie Valens. The album sold more than 2 million copies and Los 
Lobos' title track spent 3 weeks at No. 1 on the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
The natural thing from a commercial standpoint would have been for Los Lobos to 
return with another collection of good-time oldies. But that would have meant 
setting aside the compelling vision that made "Moon" and the earlier "How Will 
the Wolf Survive?" recordings so memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the quintet released "La Pistola y El Corazon," an album of Mexican 
folk music. The album sold about 100,000 copies -- impressive for such a daring 
venture, but negligible when compared to the "La Bamba" success. 
</P>
<P>
Louie Perez and David Hidalgo, the group's primary songwriters, now admit that 
Los Lobos was, in some ways, buying time with the "La Pistola" album. 
</P>
<P>
"The only sad part of the 'Moon' album (experience) was that it was 
overshadowed by 'La Bamba,' " said Hidalgo, who also sings lead on most Los 
Lobos tunes. He was sitting with Perez on the porch of Perez's old family house 
in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to see the crowds start getting bigger at the shows, but we would 
wonder sometimes why these people were in the theater. Was it to see us or just 
because of the movie? So, in a way we were removed from some of that success." 
</P>
<P>
The "Pistola" project, he added, was designed to salute the Mexican folk music 
that the group played for years at weddings and dances in East Los Angeles 
before moving over to rock in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, who plays drums and writes most of the band's lyrics, said "Pistola" 
gave them a way to "dig back, get back to us again . . . help us get on the 
right track to write 
</P>
<P>
this new album." 
</P>
<P>
The band's new album, "The Neighborhood," features a few bluesy, high-spirited 
workouts that should appeal to "La Bamba" fans, but mainly the album -- which 
will be released Tuesday -- radiates with the disarming artistic vision 
exhibited in "By the Light of the Moon." (See adjoining review). 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always easy. 
</P>
<P>
Los Lobos -- which will be in concert Oct. 18 at the Starlight Bowl in San 
Diego and Oct. 19 at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles -- began work on the new 
album in late 1988, expecting to finish in time for release last January. But 
writing it took longer than expected. One reason: "La Bamba's" success. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt great when (Warner Bros. Records president) Lenny Waronker told us, 
'Don't worry about the 'La Bamba' thing. . . . Get back to what you guys are 
about,' " said Perez, who tends to speak more during interviews than Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's not that we ever thought of trying to make 'La Bamba II.' That would 
have been ridiculous. But there's no doubt that during the course of writing 
the songs for this album there was this thing looming over you . . . the 
thought that you have to live up to the commercial success that we had with 'La 
Bamba.' " 
</P>
<P>
Perez paused -- as if trying to find the right words to describe the 
psychological currents at work in the band as they made the new album. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we told ourselves a few times that maybe we shouldn't be as dark and 
as introspective as 'Moon.' . . . That maybe we should do something more 
accessible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But every time we started going too far in that direction, we found ourselves 
stopping and clearing the table . . . starting all over, getting back to 
something that really meant something to us. 
</P>
<P>
When Perez, 37, talks about his neighborhood, on the porch of the small, 
one-bedroom house that his grandparents passed on to his dad when his parents 
got married, he is also talking about his music. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a funny place, kind of in the middle of nowhere," he said of the 
neighborhood near the intersection of Brooklyn and Eastern avenues. "It has 
always been that way as far as the gangs were concerned. They kind of left this 
area alone because it was like nobody's territory. 
</P>
<P>
"One (gang's) territory begins over there around Eastern and there's another 
that starts at the top of the hill and another when you cross Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never a completely peaceful place, but it was this little island when I 
was growing up. It's starting to deteriorate now. Things are starting to creep 
up on it a little bit. About the only thing that is left here is a lot of 
memories." 
</P>
<P>
Many of those memories are musical. 
</P>
<P>
"There was always music at the house," Perez said, while his mother prepared 
chiles rellenos for him and Hidalgo in the kitchen. "My mom was really into 
music. When I was about 8 or 9, she used to drag my sister and myself to 
downtown L.A. to these Mexican variety shows." 
</P>
<P>
The four original members of Los Lobos (saxophonist Steve Berlin joined the 
group in the '80s) were friends at Garfield High School, but were in separate 
rock bands until getting together in the early '70s. Disillusioned by only 
being able to play Top 40 hits at clubs and dances with their bands, the four 
friends began exploring acoustic Mexican music in their off hours at the Perez 
house. 
</P>
<P>
They enjoyed it so much -- and found such a positive reaction to it -- that 
they switched styles, playing hundreds of weddings and dances between 1974 and 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, however, Los Lobos got caught up in the energy and imagination that 
was being generated by such rock bands as X and the Blasters on the Hollywood 
club circuit, and the group shifted to rock. 
</P>
<P>
There were other bands on the scene with a Latino connection, including the 
Plugz and Los Illegals, but none offered the originality and imagination of Los 
Lobos' cross-cultural vision. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people warned us that we'd never be accepted in the Hollywood rock 
clubs," Hidalgo said. "And other people used to tell us how they liked our 
music better before we started playing the Hollywood clubs." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't buy it," Perez said. "The idea that there were boundaries or 
limitations because we were from East Los Angeles or there might be some racial 
problem," he said. "It's real easy for people to just kind of put themselves 
into this psychological gridlock. . . . Like, 'You're stuck here and there is 
nothing you can do about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The early shows had the relaxed, good-natured feel of a neighborhood block 
party. But gradually, an undercurrent of social commentary began to surface and 
the group stepped up to an entire new creative level. 
</P>
<P>
A turning point was 1984's "Will the Wolf Survive?," a song of hope from the 
group's second Slash album. 
</P>
<P>
Sample lyrics: 
</P>
<P>
 All alone in a world that's changed 
</P>
<P>
 Running scared now forced to hide 
</P>
<P>
 In a land where he once stood with pride 
</P>
<P>
 But he'll find his way by the morning light 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by the strong response to "Wolf," Perez and Hidalgo began 
concentrating more fully on social themes in the stirring "By the Light of the 
Moon" album. 
</P>
<P>
Though part of the power of the music was in its reflection of a barrio 
experience, the songs were written with a universality that made them odes to 
people anywhere who cling to their ideals and faith in the face of handicaps 
and social adversity. 
</P>
<P>
The memories at Perez's house aren't all musical. 
</P>
<P>
Before heading inside for lunch, Perez saw two youngsters walking down the 
street, pulling a wagon, and remembered his own childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things you learn real quickly as a little kid riding your bike 
. . . like where you can go without running into gangs or trouble. . . . But 
there are other things that take you years to figure out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Like, I could never understand why all those women were in the building around 
the corner. . . . 150 sewing machines in there. It was a sweatshop. It just 
didn't seem right, but you didn't know why. Those are some of the things we 
explore now in our music." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Perez and Hidalgo used the image of a sweatshop worker in "One Time, 
One Night," on the last album, and there are other images of the neighborhood 
in some of the songs on the new album. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't set out to call the album 'The Neighborhood,' " Perez said. "It (the 
title song) was one of the last songs we wrote for the album and it seemed to 
tie things together. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a song about urban decay and drugs and everything. . . . About the way 
each person in a family is affected by the pressures of the inner city." 
</P>
<P>
Perez lives with his wife and three sons (ages 14, 5 and 1) about 15 minutes 
away in Whittier, and he's planning to move his mother closer to him. (Hidalgo 
also lives in Whittier, while Rosas lives in Rowland Heights, Lozano lives in 
Walnut and Berlin makes his home near Seattle.) Most of her old friends in the 
neighborhood have either moved or died, and the bars on the windows underscore 
his concern about increased crime in the area. Meanwhile, he stops by often to 
say hello or have lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the darkness in the song "The Neighborhood," there is also an ultimate 
sense of optimism -- a faith in the resilience of people: 
</P>
<P>
Like the smallest rose 
</P>
<P>
Out of the hardest ground 
</P>
<P>
Like a tiny hand 
</P>
<P>
Reaching up for the sun ... 
</P>
<P>
Let's hope our hearts are one. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get away from the usual news of gang violence and drive-bys and 
everything else, but there's no reason to lose hope," Perez said. "And that's 
what we do in our music. We try to be constructive, give people some of that 
hope." 
</P>
<P>
Perez paused once more, digging deeper into the band's philosophy and past. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to make a decision a long time ago . . . whether to just be a good sock 
hop band or something more," he said. "And I think the answer to that question 
had a lot to do with where we came from. . . . This neighborhood."

RETHINKING 'NIXON IN CHINA'; 
</P>
<P>
CONTEMPORARY OPERA IS UPDATED AS PETER SELLARS REVISES STAGING OF 1987 
PRODUCTION IN LIGHT OF THE TIAN AN MEN KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost three years after its premiere, Music Center Opera finally will present 
"Nixon in China" -- the opera it agreed to co-produce in 1986. Ironically, the 
passage of time since the initial 1987 Houston Grand Opera production has seen 
major developments in China that are being addressed by the creators, so Los 
Angeles audiences will see a premiere, of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
Post-Tian An Men Square, the ending of "Nixon in China" -- the staging, at 
least -- has been revised. 
</P>
<P>
The brainchild of director Peter Sellars and based on then-President Richard M. 
Nixon's historic 1972 visit to China, the opera will have five performances 
beginning Sept. 11, delayed from the previous season so that it could be part 
of the current Los Angeles Festival, also directed by Sellars. 
</P>
<P>
These performances mark both a culmination and a crossroads for the opera. 
Although this production has already run in five other cities and been 
documented on television and recordings (with a video disc from London due next 
year), Sellars says he has only now really resolved some of its issues, working 
a major revision on his staging in light of the Tian An Men Square massacre. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling that we'll finally come to terms with the piece here for the 
first time," Sellars says. "We really got the piece figured out in Amsterdam. 
It's been 
</P>
<P>
wonderful to work on 'Nixon' over six times and begin to the solve the piece. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we can begin to look at what the piece really does say about U.S.-Chinese 
relationships," Sellars reports. "I think a lot of people thought of it as a 
little bit on the light side. It's darker elements will come to the fore now. 
I'm going to restage a couple of episodes, rather completely, in a further 
development of the ballet and the last act." 
</P>
<P>
There is much there that could lend itself to such darkening. Parodying "The 
Red Detachment of Women," the ballet by choreographer Mark Morris is already a 
high-voltage confrontation between revolutionary imperatives and establishment 
ennervation, between theater and reality. The chorus sings "Nothing can change 
without discipline, give me that gun," giving way to Chiang Ch'ing's 
fire-breathing aria. There she sings "When I appear people hang upon my words," 
but the music emphasizes the word hang in grim irony, only then completing the 
phrase. 
</P>
<P>
In the finale, the Nixons and Mao and Chiang Ch'ing reflect as interlaced 
couples on their past, the Americans with simplicity and unconscious humor, the 
Chinese with tired philosophy and sexual innuendo. It is left for Chou En'Lai 
to mediate their nostalgia and hopes with his own uncertain reflections on how 
much of what they had done (in the past and during the just ending meeting) was 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
We saw our parents' nakedness; 
</P>
<P>
Rivers of blood will be required 
</P>
<P>
To cover them. Rivers of blood. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A bankrupt people repossessed 
</P>
<P>
The ciphers of its history 
</P>
<P>
And not one character could say 
</P>
<P>
Whether the war was over yet 
</P>
<P>
Or if they'd written off the debt. 
</P>
<P>
What Sellars will make of this remains to be seen. He does say, though, that " 
'Nixon' is staged in many ways as a classical Chinese opera," which might 
surprise many who have described it in terms of traditional Western opera. He 
points out though, that "there will be actual Kun opera in the festival (by 
performers from Shanghai now living here) and people will be able to make some 
comparisons." 
</P>
<P>
Concluding the opera seems to have been difficult from the beginning. Adams 
actually created a separate work, "The Chairman Dances," as a sort of 
orchestral gloss on part of the finale scenario discarded early on in the 
collaborative process. Sellars revised his staging for the final scene itself 
during rehearsals for the Houston Grand Opera premiere, changing the setting 
from an exhausted, slightly tipsy banquet to a surrealistic dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
The final scene has also been restored to its original intent as Act III, 
separated now by an intermission from the ballet scene that caps Act II. In 
another departure from the original production, "Nixon" has gained the hotly 
debated blessings of supertitles. Composer John Adams has been quoted as saying 
he banned them in Houston, but now after seeing the piece in several other 
houses, he says he is in favor of them. As in Houston and elsewhere, "Nixon" 
will be amplified and is, of course, in English. But Adams cites the subtle 
glories of librettist Alice Goodman's text as sufficient reason to enlist the 
aid of the projected word, though he is not sure how it will work in the 
multilayered finale. 
</P>
<P>
As Nixon in China opened diplomatic doors, so "Nixon in China" has been opening 
opera doors -- literally and metaphorically -- around the world. Not since the 
heyday of Puccini was a new opera -- and a first opera, at that, for Adams and 
Goodman -- awaited with such shrewedly stoked anticipation. More amazing yet, 
its impact has easily balanced all the preliminary buzz. 
</P>
<P>
With its expressive, amplified, post-minimalist music, its use of iconic 
figures from the mythology of the media culture, its dramaturgic freshness, 
"Nixon in China" is representative of a burgeoning and peculiarly American 
school of opera, one that sells readily to a public here and in Europe. 
"There's no doubt that contemporary American opera -- especially by minimalist 
composers and especially on contemporary themes -- is very attractive," says 
Peter Hemmings, general director of Music Center Opera. 
</P>
<P>
In the use of such figures, "Nixon in China" is not unique -- Anthony Davis' 
"X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X" and Philip Glass' "Satyagraha" are 
important and influential predecessors -- though it is groundbreaking in using 
subjects who are still living. Houston Grand Opera protected itself, its 
co-commissioning companies and the "Nixon" creators, with an "errors and 
omissions" insurance policy in case material in the opera was challenged as 
defamatory or not in the public domain. (In case you were wondering, Nixon 
himself has not seen the opera. His representative, John Taylor, says that the 
President has never liked to see himself on television or other media, and has 
little interest in opera.) 
</P>
<P>
Post-modern theater is much more intent on involving audiences than alienating 
them, and contemporary figures such as Nixon, Malcolm X and Gandhi have been 
subjects of contemporary American operas in part because of the immediacy of 
the feelings they arouse. 
</P>
<P>
"A new opera that wants to become engaged with life in the 20th Century must 
know that 20th-Century society is a highly mediated society," says James 
Collins, author of "Uncommon Cultures: Popular Culture and Post-Modernism." 
"American post-modernism is much more engaged with the here and now. Stories 
like Nixon's are larger than life, but there is a verisimilitude, a documentary 
quality to them." 
</P>
<P>
Adams concurs, with elaborations. "I think what is most interesting is the 
larger picture, of taking stories from contemporary life, of characters whose 
situations are known through the highly distorting view of the media. It's 
interesting to use these stories, and then to get beyond them to the roots of 
the characters." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 Sellars said, "It's nice that people can feel that extra frisson again 
and realize that opera really does engage with the world. There's going to be a 
real surge of writing like this in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
His prediction is coming true. In July, "The Manson Family," by John Moran, a 
disciple of Philip Glass, premiered at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall in New 
York. It deals with its notorious subjects in the allusive, non-linear fashion 
of the Glass/Robert Wilson "Einstein on the Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Sellars' 1987 prophecy has also proven to be literally self-fulfilling. The 
"Nixon" gang of three is now hard at work on "The Death of Klinghoffer," 
dealing with the tragic events of the 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking, which may 
prove even more polarizing and controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Collins sees the use of such volatile subjects as part of an effort to redefine 
contemporary, cutting-edge work. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an attempt to break out of the whole avant-garde Establishment. It 
really takes apart the avant-garde position of art as oppositional and 
aggressive -- there's been a profound rethinking of that in the last 10 years 
-- and goes further. It shows very clearly that you can have art that is very 
oppositional, making a clear political statement, but that is also direct and 
part of the media culture." 
</P>
<P>
"Klinghoffer" will premiere in Brussels in March, 1991, turning up at the Music 
Center in 1992, with the Los Angeles Festival numbered among the 
co-comissioning forces. "I hope it reinforces the point that opera is 
up-to-date," Sellars says in a monumental understatement, given the current 
events in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"I really view it as a religious drama," says Adams, who has finished the first 
draft of the score. "I'm almost done with it, then I turn around and do six 
months of grueling orchestration. Obviously, the tone is darker. It's a little 
more articulated structurally" than "Nixon," he says, and less like a verismo 
opera. It will be in two acts, with a prologue and epilogue, and the singers in 
it will sing more than one part. 
</P>
<P>
Adams is going to conduct "Klinghoffer" in the San Francisco and Glyndebourne 
runs, and for the recording. (The "Nixon" recording was also contracted before 
the opera premiered, as was the telecast -- rare indeed for any contemporary 
opera, let alone a neophyte effort.) He also says he will be conducting here in 
the future, though he is coy about when and where and in what. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to remind myself that there's a strong possibility that my next opera 
or succeeding opera may not be as famous or well-known," Adams says, while 
making a strong pitch for his newer music. "I'm always trying to tell Simon 
Rattle that I have other things than 'Harmonium,' " a work for chorus and 
orchestra on poems by Emily Dickinson and John Donne, dating from 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Is there then an in-joke hidden in Mao's pensive lines in the "Nixon" finale? 
</P>
<P>
I shut my eyes and, listening 
</P>
<P>
Hard, hear the old harmonium 
</P>
<P>
We left behind. 
</P>
<P>
As Sellars grapples yet again with "Nixon," there are already other takes on 
the opera. The Bielefeld Opera mounted a radically new production last 
December, directed by John Dew, and designed by Gottfried Pilz with 
choreography by Calvin Jackson. There, in defiance of librettist Goodman's 
insistence that the opera is heroic, Nixon and Mao were given putty noses in a 
garish and heavy-handed satire. 
</P>
<P>
Adams is not happy with what he has heard about that production, but glad to 
see that the opera is attractive on its own merits, rather than simply as a 
vehicle for Sellars. 
</P>
<P>
"It is encouraging, because after spending two years on a work, you hope it has 
a life of its own," the composer says. Another new production, with an 
unusually long run of 15 performances, will be mounted in Finland in the fall 
by Jorma Hynninen's Finnish National Opera. 
</P>
<P>
All of this activity is part of the blossoming of contemporary American opera. 
"I think lots of things are conspiring so that now companies are competing for 
new operas," says Sellars, who in characteristic fashion chortles openly over 
the success of "Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
"I love the fact that opera companies have realized that what puts them on the 
map is not engaging Placido Domingo for 72 hours, but doing new work like 
'Nixon.' "

BERLINER BRINGS A SPECIAL PERSPECTIVE TO 'FIDELIO'; 
</P>
<P>
GOTZ FRIEDRICH, DIRECTING THE MUSIC CENTER SEASON OPENER, IS A MAN WHO KNOWS OF 
TYRANNY FIRSTHAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Huddling around a table with cast members of "Fidelio," Gotz Friedrich seems 
calm now, even philosophical. But earlier in rehearsal the eminent German 
director had been scolded by his wife, soprano Karan Armstrong "for crying," he 
says, "for getting too emotional" during the ultimately moving Prisoners' 
Chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's only opera -- opening the Music Center Opera season on Tuesday -- 
does that to people, and not least to a man who knows personally about its 
subject: the loss of human rights, "the terrible process that all Germans of my 
generation have gone through." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Friedrich was a boy when the Third Reich came to power and turned his 
country into a police state. By age 14, he knew the implied horrors and more, 
thanks to a father "who was close to the men responsible for trying to kill 
Hitler on July 20, 1944." 
</P>
<P>
"And where I lived (Naumburg) came at first the liberating Americans, only to 
be followed by the Red Army. Political oppression was then all around me. 
Living in East Germany until 40 years old I knew little else." 
</P>
<P>
But Beethoven, he says, sounded the call to freedom more than a century earlier 
-- when Napoleon's armies crossed into Austria and occupied Salzburg. Rallying 
against that travesty, the prescient composer tapped into what Germans have 
experienced in the last half century: living as a divided people. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1973 when Friedrich defected from East Berlin's Komische Oper. Since 
1981, he has been director of the Deutsche Oper in West Berlin. Now, with the 
end of the Cold War and the crumbling of the wall, he finally is unified with 
the city of his artistic origins. 
</P>
<P>
So how will the innovative director who sees opera as a theatrically serious 
and socially relevant subject stage his "Fidelio"? Will it depict East Berlin 
with Checkpoint Charlie still a decisive border? Or maybe he will look to 
something equally topical -- the United States in Panama or the Iraqi invasion 
of Kuwait. Just last year, San Diego Opera placed "Fidelio" in a 
banana-republic context. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing of the sort," says Friedrich in a mellifluous Maurice Chevalier basso 
with a pronounced accent. "I know that seems strange, especially when you 
consider what is usual among German directors who like to set 'Fidelio' as a 
Nazi death camp or a gulag in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, you should keep old operas in their time while doing everything to 
show that the same oppression could happen right here, right now. Each person 
in the audience must have his own inside picture of what that oppression is. 
</P>
<P>
"An old story can be good and a brand-new story likewise, but opera is most 
thrilling when it has both the old and new story. Combining the two of them 
shows the humanistic message in all its permanence." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that Friedrich minimizes the milestone of German reunification. He 
says that he is profoundly touched, especially because what occurred last year 
"was a weightless and nonviolent revolution." 
</P>
<P>
"I am amazed that not one person was killed. This is new in world history. But 
the danger would be to show the ("Fidelio") prisoners as victims of the Stasi 
(the East German intelligence service). The fundamental message carries better 
without social realism because everyone knows the appellation of freedom. It 
covers all situations -- in camps and prisons everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The director -- who brought to the Music Center Opera its inaugural "Otello," 
earlier oversaw his evocatively surreal "Die Tote Stadt" and in 1988 a stylized 
"Kat'a Kabanova" -- now asks for the freedom of abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
He points to the character Leonore, who searches for, finds and liberates her 
captive husband. 
</P>
<P>
"She knows nothing about politics," he explains. "Why should she have a 
political identity? Her courage defines her. It's such a strong, human story -- 
I don't need to place it in a specific location or even to teach the audience 
history lessons. Let them respond to the tale, which is a fairy tale, in a way, 
a dream/nightmare as it was in 1945, when the Nazi death camps opened." 
</P>
<P>
Even the sets, which will borrow only "a few concrete symbols," are not tied to 
an actual time or place. "I want to provoke a feeling of claustrophobia, to 
show everyone in its grip and how the imprisonment of one person implicates all 
the others." 
</P>
<P>
The lunch break is over and Friedrich calls his cast back to rehearsal, the Act 
I finale. Now he gets the chance to illuminate his brand of theatrical truth -- 
through characterization. A hands-on director, he searches out the motives for 
each actor's utterances. 
</P>
<P>
The scene begins with Jonathan Mack (Jacquino) remonstrating his impatience 
with Marzelline. She doesn't want to marry him, preferring that nice Fidelio 
(who is really Leonore disguised as a man). 
</P>
<P>
The ruddy-complexioned, rather paunchy director sits back and watches, fumbling 
for a cigarette. He lets the episode finish, then slowly gets up, shuffles onto 
the playing area and stands next to Mack. Lapsing into English -- the main 
rehearsal business is all in German -- he declaims Jacquino's line: 
</P>
<P>
"Even if she doesn't love me, at least let her marry me," he hollers, banging 
his fists on his thighs and gasping in exasperation. He pads back to his seat 
and observes Mack's improved repeat. "Ja, wohl," says the director. 
</P>
<P>
But when Michael Devlin fails to appear on cue, Friedrich calls out to the 
singer, who is standing behind the bleachers: "You will not be issued a special 
invitation to be on stage for your sung parts." 
</P>
<P>
The tone of gentle sarcasm is mock-gruff. Friedrich is not really-high strung 
or temperamental. Later, he shows Devlin, as the villain Pizarro, how to inject 
vitality into a small exchange between himself and Rocco (Matti Salminen). A 
cross-examining Pizarro, suspicious of Rocco's possible sympathy for the 
prisoner, listens to the lowly jailer absolve himself. 
</P>
<P>
As Pizarro, Friedrich moves up brazenly close to Rocco and gazes right into his 
face. Then he turns away and speaks aloud his observations of Rocco: "Oh, he's 
smarter than I thought. This is no little dog. He's at least a buffalo." A new 
dimension has been added. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Karen Beardsley (Marzelline) arrives, the action is considerably 
more intense. The director makes her translate her lines because he feels they 
sound too much like generalized bluster to mean anything. Afterwards she goes 
back to the German and he issues an appraisal: 
</P>
<P>
"It is better, but not good. I almost understand one word," he laughs. "But 
that's progress, my love." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a director's concept fails to make itself known to audiences and 
critics. But if Friedrich has his way, unification will come about as surely 
for "Fidelio" as it has for Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The two-act opera, commonly regarded as problematic, sits uncomfortably between 
the category of rustic little household conflict and paean to soaring idealism, 
replete with highly charged, transcendent music. 
</P>
<P>
"However, I don't think of 'Fidelio' as a Singspiel (light opera) that 
progresses to a drama," he says earnestly, while fumbling again for a 
cigarette. "What seems so trifling in the first scene is only a cover for 
terror, which I show by using a shortened form of the dialogue, with pauses 
between lines. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the characters -- Marzelline, her father Rocco and his assistant 
Jacquino -- know at some level that they are prisoners too. 
</P>
<P>
"I even have my doubts that Florestan (the principal prisoner) is saved at the 
end. As for Leonore, she wants to rescue everyone -- not just her husband." 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich, who learned his craft under the legendary Walter Felsenstein at the 
Komische Oper, says he had to save himself some 20 years ago from an oppressive 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to gain just the ordinary human rights that the West takes for 
granted, I had to rebel. Like Don Quixote, I could not exist with the terrible 
border that had been imposed." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he gave interviews citing "artistic freedom" as his reason for 
defecting. "But that was inaccurate," he says now. "My real goal was to gain 
political freedom. I couldn't admit that then, however, without risking the 
penalty of criticizing the system. The DDR (East German Republic) would have 
chased me for uttering such bad words." 
</P>
<P>
When he returns home, Friedrich will face an entirely different dilemma: a 
newly unified Berlin that must administer three opera companies -- his own 
Deutsche Oper, the State Opera and the Komische Oper. With the economy already 
in an upheaval because of the East-West disparity between jobs and technology, 
the arts are equally up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
"The decisions will be momentous," he says. "Does Berlin need three opera 
companies and 20 theaters and separate houses for operetta? Which of these 
belong to the central government, which to the state of Berlin and which to the 
city of Berlin? It's so complicated I don't want to even think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Judgments must be made, he says, and they involve ranking of the different 
companies as well as allocating monies based on the ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not hear any of this with pleasure," Friedrich admits. "But I'll have to 
get into the fray just to fight such categorization. All these years we were 
liberal in the best tradition of free art. What irony that with the great 
opening of our world the arts are in jeopardy."

WELL-SCHOOLED CLOTHES

<P>
After a summer of neon-bright shorts and T-shirts festooned with cartoon 
characters, the freshest looks in children's fall fashion hark back to -- an 
unexpected surprise -- traditional styles. But not everything is regimentally 
striped and boringly home-grown. 
</P>
<P>
There's a definite international influence -- pants made of Guatemalan fabrics 
and shirts printed with designs from Italy -- but the comfortable fabrics, 
traditional patterns and classic shapes turning up in this fall's kids' clothes 
can only be called all-American. 
</P>
<P>
Like all-American kids themselves, these new looks break some very old fashion 
rules. Traditional patterns -- plaids, patchwork, nature prints, stars and 
stripes -- may be back, but adults should forget trying to combine them like 
old-school, mix-and-match outfits. Free expression reigns these days -- all 
manner of prints go together playfully. A classroom-ready palette of crayon 
reds, golds, greens, browns and blues replaces flashy neons and beachy brights. 
And denim is again a staple, from light blue chambray shirts to deep indigo 
jeans, jackets and overalls. Cotton, wool and blended knits appear in ribbed, 
twilled and quilted textures. To top it all off: Cozy sweaters bring out the 
child in everyone. BARBARA FOLEY

MONTECITO GRASSES; 
</P>
<P>
A HILLSIDE OF GRACEFUL, DROUGHT-TOLERANT PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In front of a house on a Montecito hill, the undulating landscape of perennial 
grasses, as pretty as any lawn, is designed to survive whatever tough watering 
laws come along. All the plants here are drought-resistant and irrigated by a 
maze of drip tubing that puts water precisely at their bases instead of 
throwing most of it to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
Created by Santa Barbara landscape architect Joan F. Radditz, this garden is 
only a year and a half old and not completely tested, but most of the plants, 
including the grasses, needed to be watered only two or three times to survive 
the summer. The house, set back from the street atop a carefully graded 
hillock, has a view of the distant ocean. To connect house, hill and ocean, 
Radditz "turned the hill into a dune" by covering it with grasses that pick up 
every ocean breeze. "I wanted a soothing tapestry of green, red and blue-gray 
that flowed up the hill," Radditz says. 
</P>
<P>
The green comes from common fountain grass, Pennisetum setaceum; the red from 
its close cousin, P. setaceum 'Cupreum,' and the blue-gray accents from a 
European grass named Elymus arenarius 'Glaucus,' often sold mistakenly as the 
native California grass E. glaucus. Clumps of common pampas grass provide 
texture. 
</P>
<P>
The green fountain grass has a reputation for spreading out of control and 
becoming a nuisance, but the red variety is perfectly civilized. Elymus can be 
a little rambunctious, spreading underground on rhizomes, but drip irrigation, 
which does not wet the surrounding soil, seems to keep it in check. The pampas 
grass also seeds freely; gardeners in some parts of the state consider it a 
noxious weed. Some of the less common varieties of pampas grass, such as 
Cortaderia selloana 'Pumila,' may be more desirable, since they do not seed, 
says Pomona nurseryman John Greenlee. For smaller properties, he suggests that 
Pennisetum alopecuroides, a close cousin of green pennisetum that does not seed 
much and goes dormant in winter, might be more appropriate. (Greenlee's large 
nursery specializes in grasses for landscape professionals. He also has a 
mail-order business for homeowners; catalogues are available for $2.50 from 
Greenlee Nursery, 301 E. Franklin Ave., Pomona 91766.) 
</P>
<P>
For the three acres Radditz had to cover, aggressive grasses that can survive 
on little or no water were the perfect solution. To make sure the plants do not 
wander onto neighbors' property, Radditz created natural barriers. On one side 
of the hill, she planted a large and deep screen of Dodonaea viscosa 
'Purpurea,' the purple hop bush (which has leaves tinged with red, much like 
the grasses it guards). And on both sides of the driveway, she used a wide 
planting of native ceanothus, the blue-flowered 'Yankee Point.' 
</P>
<P>
The grasses bloom until late fall and are cropped close to the ground between 
November and January. It's best to remove the dead leaves, or they will make 
unsightly clumps after a few years. The plants will spring back quickly with 
the first winter rain. 
</P>
<P>
Olive trees surround the stream bed and dot the property. Landscape contractor 
John Bugay procured the full-grown, mature trees from a central California 
grove and moved them onto the site, which explains the established look of the 
landscape. Because they are all the same age and from the same grove, they tie 
the plan together neatly. 
</P>
<P>
There is another garden -- quite small and more traditional in plan and 
planting -- close to the house. Enclosed by low walls, it could be watered with 
buckets if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The house was designed so there would be no need for foundation plantings; the 
grasses flow right up to its walls, and it appears to have come magically from 
the sky, like Dorothy's house, to land softly in a field of grass.

drought-stricken Santa Barbara area. Richard Fish

A Cuban couple and their baby daughter who had sought refuge at the Spanish 
Embassy six weeks ago ended their bid for asylum. An embassy official said 
Sergio Wong and his wife, Maribel, had decided to leave the embassy in Havana 
with their daughter, Elizabeth, because Maribel was worried about the health of 
her elderly father, who has a heart problem. The Wongs, looking nervous but 
otherwise well, were escorted with their baby by Spanish diplomats through the 
Cuban police cordon around the embassy and driven to the home of Maribel's 
father.

WILD ANIMALS ARE EATING AWAY AT PARCHED SANTA CATALINA ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN M. ROSE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the dry summer heat on Santa Catalina Island, wild buffalo roll in the dust 
and munch on clumps of grass. Spotted baby boar scurry along the edge of a 
trickling canyon stream, digging up roots under the soil. Goats meander on a 
hillside and feed on green tree seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
To tourists rambling through the hills of the 65-square-mile nature preserve, 
owned and managed by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, these scenes might 
appear idyllic. But for the conservancy's naturalists and ecologists, they 
spell disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The grazing animals, introduced by man to Catalina's harsh semi-desert climate, 
are literally eating away at the island. 
</P>
<P>
To protect the island's scarce plants -- some of which are found nowhere else 
-- the conservancy has tried for years to reduce the numbers of non-native 
animals on the island, at times using controversial measures such as mass 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
"If let alone, they would totally overrun the place," said Doug Propst, 
president of the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to control the animals now are more critical than ever, conservancy 
officials say, because of the four-year drought dogging Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
What little vegetation grows during the winter is quickly eaten, threatening 
the survival of some plant species and contributing to erosion. 
</P>
<P>
The drought also has exacerbated other concerns of the conservancy: guarding 
against fire and regulating water sources needed for residential and commercial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a worse drought than any recorded on the island in the past 30 years," 
said Keith LeFever, who manages the island's water supplies for Southern 
California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
During drought conditions, the animals' hearty appetites threaten to take an 
even bigger bite out of the island's unique plant life. Young tree saplings, 
for instance, are especially vulnerable to grazing but are crucial for the 
nature preserve's survival, said Misty Gay, conservancy naturalist. 
</P>
<P>
If the existing saplings are not protected now and new trees do not grow, Gay 
warns, then "when our oak trees reach the end of their lives -- 100 or 150 
years from now -- we could lose all of them." 
</P>
<P>
In the island's interior, it is obvious where boar have ravaged whole hillsides 
by uprooting plants and grass, leaving dark brown streaks and tufts of rootless 
dying vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
Looking out over a hillside where goats have cleared away stretches that look 
as bare as the moon, Propst noted: "Everything evolved here under no grazing 
pressure. It's a very tender flora." 
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the island, conservancy officials say, the land is recovering 
as a result of various animal-control measures. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the conservancy has been shipping a weekly average of 20 wild 
buffalo to a ranch in Oklahoma. First brought to the island by filmmakers for 
the 1924 silent film "The Vanishing American," the buffalo now number about 
400, the fourth-largest herd of North American bison. The conservancy hopes to 
reduce the herd to 100. 
</P>
<P>
Goats, each capable of gobbling up 2,000 pounds of vegetation a year, are 
perhaps the most destructive animals on Catalina, Gay said. Spanish 
missionaries are believed to have introduced them to the island during the 
1800s to help feed the Indian population. 
</P>
<P>
Hired sharpshooters killed thousands of goats earlier this year on the island's 
small west end, where renewed growth is now visible. Similar programs can be 
expected throughout the island in the future, Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy also allows game hunters to shoot boar, deer and goats during 
the fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to run a game preserve," said Propst, who noted that hunting 
was the very reason deer and boar were originally brought to the island. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the hunting and goat-killing, the conservancy has come under attack 
from animal rights groups such as the Fund for Animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that goats are destructive to the habitat, but there are 
non-lethal alternatives," including sterilization, said Jerye Mooney, Los 
Angeles coordinator for the Fund for Animals. 
</P>
<P>
The Fund for Animals is particularly opposed to hunting with bow and arrow, the 
only type of hunting now allowed on the island. "Bow-hunting is the cruelest 
form," Mooney said, because many animals manage to escape but suffer from 
implanted arrows. 
</P>
<P>
But the conservancy says both animal and plant life on the island would 
eventually be destroyed without the controlled killings -- that vegetation 
would be ravaged and the island's animals would have nothing to eat. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy has tried in the past to trap and ship goats off Catalina, but 
that led to widespread stress-related illnesses and deaths among the animals, 
Propst said. Sterilizing the goats, many of whom live in out-of-the-way 
canyons, is impractical, according to the conservancy staff. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't kill the goats, they'd kill themselves and the island with them," 
Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
The grazing animals compete with the island's native mammals for scarce food 
supplies, putting pressure on rare species such as the Channel Island fox, 
listed by the state as endangered, said Penelope O'Malley, spokeswoman for the 
conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials point out that the family of chewing-gum magnate William 
Wrigley Jr., which owned the island and donated most of it to the conservancy 
in 1975, specifically wanted to preserve native plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
The imported animals aren't the only threat to the fragile balance of plants 
and wildlife. Although the native plants are well-adapted to drought, the 
continuing dryness presents a fire risk in certain of the more heavily wooded 
areas, such as the hills north of Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
One fire in recent years nearly wiped out a grove of Catalina ironwoods -- 
tall, slender trees native only to the island. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina usually gets between 12 and 14 inches of rain annually, Edison's 
LeFever said. But during the last 12 months, there's been less than six inches. 
</P>
<P>
Natural pools of water, used for drinking by animals, have dried up, LeFever 
said. To help blunt the impact of the drought this summer, water troughs have 
been placed in grazing areas for buffalo and other thirsty animals. Blocks of 
molasses are also put out in the hills to help animals supplement their protein 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
The island's other animals -- the 2,500 human residents of Avalon -- also vie 
for Catalina's scarce water. 
</P>
<P>
To meet Avalon's needs, Southern Edison Co. has drilled wells in the 
conservancy area, raising some concern that above-ground water sources, crucial 
for plants and animals, might be affected. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of a 1962 agreement that predates the conservancy's founding, the 
utility company holds all the water rights on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy and Edison company officials said they work together to ensure that 
the pumping does not harm the environment. "We show great diligence in not 
over-pumping any of the canyons," LeFever said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a gentlemen's agreement with Edison. If any of these spots dry up, 
they'll have to stick some water back in there," Propst said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Avalon's impact on the interior is limited, conservancy officials 
said. And development plans must be handled in such a way that life in the 
conservancy is not compromised, they add. 
</P>
<P>
Propst said he is confident the island's unique environment can be preserved, 
noting, "This is California how it used to be and how it will always be here."

TURNOUT LOW BUT SPIRITS HIGH AT FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATION: ATTENDANCE IS LESS THAN HALF WHAT WAS EXPECTED. ARTISTS FROM 21 
COUNTRIES KICK OFF 17-DAY OBSERVANCE OF ARTS OF THE PACIFIC, ASIA AND LATIN 
AMERICA. 
</P>

<P>
Though attendance fell far short of expectations, those who showed up for 
Saturday's opening day of the Los Angeles Festival at San Pedro's Point 
Fermin/Angel's Gate were treated to a cultural experience that was light-years 
away from the usual summer fest blend of hot dogs, rock bands and Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-day celebration of the arts of the Pacific, Asia and Latin America, 
which kicked off with a full day of dance, music and performances by artists 
from 21 countries, drew from 10,000 to 15,000 people -- less than half of the 
30,000 or more predicted by festival organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Christensen, an independent consultant for the festival, attributed the 
disappointing crowd to a preview published in The Times warning of possible 
traffic congestion near the park. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want to deal with gridlock and traffic snarls," Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen also noted that opening days are typically the slowest at weekend 
festivals. "We can accommodate more people," Christensen said. "We hope it 
builds in the next two days." 
</P>
<P>
But the peaceful, ethnically diverse crowd that gathered around the Korean 
Peace Bell at Angel's Gate seemed eager to participate -- and some said they 
came away awed by the experience. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Festival 1990 is a follow-up to 1984's Olympic Arts Festival and 
the 1987 Los Angeles Festival, which celebrated the arts of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Many of this year's performers have never been seen in Los Angeles and others, 
such as the Wallis &amp; Futuna Music and Dance Group from the Polynesian 
islands, have never left their homelands before. 
</P>
<P>
The list of performers Saturday included dance groups such as the Friendly 
Islanders of Tonga, Halau O'Kekuhi of Hawaii, the Woomera Mornington Island 
Culture Team, Le Ballet de Kouman Kele and others; many American Indian tribes 
from California and elsewhere gathered beneath the arbors at the festival's 
powwow grounds to serve Indian fry bread and dance for onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, you don't understand the languages, but you can understand the 
rhythms," said Sybil Mosely, 28, a costume designer from Baldwin Hills who 
sampled fry bread with her 2 1/2-year-old daughter. "And visually, it can move 
you. I was really in touch with what they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Observed Roberto Gonzalez, 38, a percussionist from Long Beach: "It's just 
unbelievable what's happening here; I can feel a lot of really good vibrations. 
Most of the time people think: 'I got this, you got that.' But in this kind of 
atmosphere, people forget their little personal differences." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Collins, a 73-year-old Cherokee Indian who still runs in the annual Los 
Angeles Marathon, took advantage of the festival to dress in his native garb 
and carried a peace pipe made from the root of a tree. "It's beautiful," he 
said. "But it would mean a lot more if we could get more of the Indian people 
to come." 
</P>
<P>
The day began at 10 a.m. against the appropriate backdrop of the glittering 
Pacific Ocean, with wind whipping colorful flags atop lines of Balinese 
"fertility poles." Festival-goers watched from the hillside as spiritual 
leaders and performers from the Pacific Rim shared blessings, gifts and 
greetings. Spectators occasionally joined in the native dances. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest member from each performing group joined together to ring the 
Korean Bell seven times -- once each in honor of the East, West, North, South, 
Mother Earth, Father Sky and the Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Then all the performers formed a mass procession down the steep hill leading 
from the Korean Bell to Point Fermin's Pacific Stage. The crowd joined them -- 
walking or dancing their way toward the coast to the beats of drums from 21 
lands. Festival director Peter Sellars, dressed in bright orange African garb 
and a pair of Nike Air Jordans, danced right along with them. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, Los Angeles Festival Chairwoman Maureen Kindel and Dr. 
Armand Hammer, chairman and chief executive officer of Occidental Petroleum 
Corp., officially opened the festival with speeches and praise for Sellars, who 
spent the last 2 1/2 years bringing the $5-million festival to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the threshold of a new movement . . . another level of cultural 
awareness," Sellars told the crowd. He said the reason for attending the 
festival is "to get an inundation of beauty." Despite low attendance, Sellars 
described Saturday's activities as "much better than we imagined -- and that's 
pretty great." 
</P>
<P>
Today, free events begin at noon and last until dusk on the various stages at 
Point Fermin/Angel's Gate, in Chinatown, Rancho La Cienega Park, on Olvera 
Street and at Koreatown Plaza. 
</P>

L.A. POLICE UNITED IN ATTITUDE, SURVEY SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: RESEARCHERS FIND THAT DESPITE AN INFLUX OF WOMEN AND 
MINORITIES, MEMBERS OF THE FORCE THINK AND ACT ALIKE. CRITICS CONTEND 
UNIFORMITY STIFLES SENSITIVITY. 
</P>

<P>
Despite the recruitment of unprecedented numbers of female, black and Latino 
officers over the last decade, members of the Los Angeles Police Department 
still think and act with remarkable uniformity, according to a study by the 
Claremont Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
The study, based on a survey of more than 1,000 officers, found that they have 
similar opinions about their lives, jobs and ideals -- regardless of their sex 
or race. 
</P>
<P>
"Bringing all these women and minorities onto the force has not made any 
significant change in the way the police perform," said George T. Felkenes, a 
criminal justice professor at the college who led the project. "Once they get 
into the department, they're shaped and molded into what the department wants 
them to be." 
</P>
<P>
Women and minorities responded just as white males did in saying they are very 
satisfied with their careers, are loyal to the force and believe the values of 
the department closely mirror their own, the researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
On a four-point scale, in which 4 means they "strongly agree," officers 
averaged a 3.49 when asked their reaction to the statement, "I am proud to work 
for this department." Sex and race had almost no bearing on the response. 
</P>
<P>
During their first year on patrol, officers of diverse backgrounds experienced 
successes and failures that were much the same, the study showed. Commendations 
were received by 85.4% of the officers, a number that was consistent among all 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen complaints were lodged against 28.7% of all officers. Women officers 
fared somewhat better, with 22.1% drawing complaints. But officers who received 
complaints compiled about the same number -- 1.62 each -- regardless of race or 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all clones," said James Lasley, a criminal justice professor at Cal 
State Fullerton, who assisted in the project. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker, the Police Department's commanding officer for 
personnel and training, hailed the findings as an affirmation of the 
department's professional, egalitarian approach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the adage in our recruitment campaign, that 'all our cops come in 
one color -- blue,' " Kroeker said. "We're getting to the point where it really 
doesn't matter what gender or race you are. We're just all cops." 
</P>
<P>
But some critics of the department, while applauding the hiring of more women 
and minorities, contended that such uniformity has stifled the sensitivity they 
had hoped a diverse force would bring. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Claremont researchers did not directly solicit officers' opinions 
on race and police tactics, civil rights leaders said the study was an 
indication that diversity does not necessarily translate into 
less-confrontational policing. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we should have more women and black and Hispanic officers," said 
Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Southern California. "But what we find is the tactics of the Police Department 
are just as brutal. The tone hasn't changed at all." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Duff, president of the Los Angeles branch of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, said there seems to be an "LAPD view of the 
world" that is inculcated in most officers. 
</P>
<P>
"The department teaches a certain kind of reaction toward certain groups of 
people," Duff said. "There's many situations where minority officers should be 
asserting their feelings and backgrounds . . . but there's a lot of pressure to 
go with that prevailing sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
Before the researchers began their study, all their questions were approved by 
Los Angeles Police Department officials, who advised them against directly 
probing racially sensitive areas. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a few questions addressed officers' perceptions of their 
relationship with the public, and these produced some of the study's few 
distinctions -- however minor -- according to the sex and race of the 
respondents. 
</P>
<P>
When asked how cooperative they find the public, non-minorities and males 
tended to view citizens as somewhat more eager to help than did females and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, males and non-minorities almost uniformly said that police officers 
have no greater understanding of human behavior than does the average person. 
But women and minorities were slightly more inclined to say that police have a 
"peculiar view" of behavior because of the "misery and cruelty" they see every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"In a quasi-military organization, you've got to expect a certain amount of 
conformity," said Hubert Williams, president of the Washington, D.C.-based 
Police Foundation, a research group. "But I don't think that means you lose 
your identity." 
</P>
<P>
The study was funded by a $125,000 grant from the Los Angeles-based John 
Randolph and Dora Haynes Foundation, which promotes academic research in the 
social sciences, economics, government and history. The results are included in 
a 369-page report published by the Claremont Graduate School's Center for 
Politics and Policy. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of two 1980 consent decrees 
that settled a federal lawsuit brought against the department seven years 
earlier by a female sergeant, Fanchon Blake. 
</P>
<P>
Under those agreements, the department agreed to accelerate hiring of women 
until they constitute 20% of the force. Officials also agreed to increase the 
number of blacks and Latinos to equal their percentage in the Los Angeles work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was thought that those long-term goals would take more than 20 
years to implement, the study found the department has made substantial 
progress toward meeting the quotas. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, women have gone from 2.4% to 12.2% of what is now an 
8,100-officer department. Blacks have gone from 6.7% to 13.2%. Latinos, whose 
numbers have increased the most, went from 10.7% to 20.4%, the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
In those same years, the percentage of white males dropped from 78.8% to 56.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really way better than any of us ever dreamed," said A. Thomas Hunt, one 
of Blake's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Blake, now retired and living in the Seattle area, said she was not surprised 
to learn that the new officers have values similar to those of the old guard. 
</P>
<P>
"Human beings are human beings," said Blake, who served 25 years on the force. 
"If you're qualified, you can do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Despite those dramatic changes in the demographics of the force, almost all 
officers -- regardless of sex or race -- told the researchers they would turn 
down better-paying jobs to stay with the Los Angeles department, would stay in 
their present positions if given a second chance and would work harder to help 
the department if needed. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Los Angeles police believe that the average officer is dedicated to 
high ideals and service, that newspapers give an unfavorable picture of what 
officers do and that arrests are the result of hard work and dedication, the 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
"Are more diverse officer populations likely to produce change in existing 
police administrations or are existing police administrations likely to produce 
standardization in diverse officer populations?" the study asked in its 
conclusion. "For LAPD . . . the latter answer fits best."

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE AMERICAN WAY DOESN'T COME CHEAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you want to appreciate the American dream -- and the fact that it's only 
affordable if U.S. industry stays competitive -- then pay attention to the 
contract negotiations between the United Auto Workers and General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, you'll have to read between the lines because the public arguments 
about wages and jobs will obscure the issues. There will be comparisons showing 
that it costs General Motors $800 more to produce a car than it costs the U.S. 
plants of Japanese car makers -- Honda in Marysville, Ohio, Nissan in Smyrna, 
Tenn., or Toyota in Georgetown, Ky. Against plants back in Japan, the cost gap 
is more than $1,000 a car. 
</P>
<P>
Behind those numbers lies a difference in what U.S. auto makers pay for pension 
and health benefits compared to what Japanese firms pay. And the real story 
goes beyond industry to reflect different societies, different priorities and 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins with the aging United Auto worker. Assembly line employees in 
U.S. plants typically have 20 years on the job, with salary, vacation and 
rising health-care bills to match. And there are a lot of retirees. General 
Motors has about 400,000 active hourly and salaried workers in automotive 
operations and 325,000 retirees. Health and pension benefits for worker and 
spouse are for life -- and add more than 33% to the average GM wage. 
</P>
<P>
They are the kind of benefits that reflect the prosperous postwar period, when 
U.S. auto makers ruled the market. And they reflect something more -- decades 
of social reforms that brought increased recognition of employee rights, to 
respect at work and dignity in retirement. Pushed by that ideal, U.S. industry 
produced a very high standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
Higher than other nations. In Japan, benefits simply are not on the order of 
what they are in the United States. During working life, companies such as 
Toyota and Nissan provide medical facilities and doctors. But the individual 
choices -- of physician and treatment -- offered in U.S. medicine are 
unheard-of luxuries. Company responsibility for health care ends with 
retirement, and government takes over. 
</P>
<P>
Retirement in Japan means more work for less money. At 55, a male worker is 
given a lump sum payment -- female workers usually are not given retirement 
benefits -- and then may take a part-time job with a supplier to his company. 
Suppliers offer lower wages and benefits. And there are a lot of suppliers. For 
example, Toyota has 67,000 employees, about one-sixth GM's total, because much 
of its work is done by suppliers. Japanese priorities are different. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, to be sure, Japanese car makers offer wages and benefits 
roughly comparable to those of U.S. firms. Here their $800-per-car cost 
differential results largely from a younger work force -- hence lower health 
and pension bills. Honda of America has one retiree, and pension costs won't 
become a burden for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Tax breaks, from Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky, also favor the transplants, as 
do their new and efficient plant and equipment and flexible non-union labor. 
</P>
<P>
But "health-care and pension costs make the biggest difference," says analyst 
Maryann N. Keller of Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney, author of "Rude 
Awakening," an analysis of General Motors' recent history. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean the costs are necessarily too high. They would be affordable 
if U.S. car makers still held 80% to 85% of the North American car market -- 
the world's largest, with 200 million cars and trucks on the road and more than 
15 million vehicles sold each year. U.S. companies held 83% of this market just 
10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But both managements and the union blew it by acting like monopolies -- the 
producers imposing cars and prices on customers, the union imposing wage 
settlements and work rules on companies. Customers found somewhere else to 
shop. And now the U.S. industry holds a 65% share of the market, with roughly 
28% held by Japanese manufacturers -- a share that auto experts project will 
reach 33% by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors has fallen from 45% of the market five years ago to 36% today, a 
loss of share that costs the company more than $20 billion in reduced sales and 
as much as $1 billion in foregone profit. 
</P>
<P>
The effect on employment and productivity has been devastating. What had been 
useful at the higher share becomes surplus at the lower. Pension costs are 
spread across fewer car sales. Productivity declines because people have less 
to do even though plants have been revamped and employment reduced by 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
A further long, slow decline seems inevitable unless GM regains market share. 
And that's why the current negotiations, looking toward a Sept. 14 contract 
date, are so critical. To regain market share, GM will have to produce and sell 
cars more economically. And that will mean more staff reductions through early 
retirement, the elimination of layers of clipboard-carrying supervisors and the 
spread to all GM plants of the team production system now working at its new 
Saturn plant in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Successful negotiations will demand a level of trust between union and 
management that hasn't existed in recent years. Yet success is possible because 
the alternative is so bleak. 
</P>
<P>
Does it matter? After all, many people say, if foreign companies produce here 
and employ Americans, does it matter who owns them? Well, right now in the auto 
business "produce here" is an overstatement. The domestic content of the 
typical Ohio Honda or Tennessee Nissan is 40% -- with the high-value parts, 
transmissions and most engines, made in Japan. That means U.S. workers miss out 
on jobs offering not only higher pay but greater opportunity for learning and 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
The job situation may improve over time. But the most profound effects on our 
society could come in taking orders from owners who do not share American 
values, who do not believe in the priority of individual choice. 
</P>
<P>
Those American priorities aren't wrong, or even unduly expensive. But we should 
realize that we have to work hard to afford them.

THE WORLD OF PRIVATE POSTAL SERVICE IS STARTING TO GO FIRST CLASS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: FRANCHISED OUTLETS FOR MAIL BOXES AND PACKAGE DELIVERY ARE THRIVING. 
THEY OFFER INCREASINGLY UPSCALE CONVENIENCES SUCH AS FAX AND MESSAGE TAKING.

<TEXT>
<P>
Not so many years ago, private postal and packaging outlets labored under the 
unsavory public perception that they were back alley mail drops used by 
nefarious types to avoid the law, bill collectors or both. 
</P>
<P>
The private postal service industry, however, has moved upscale in recent 
years, gaining popularity, respectability and even favor on Wall Street. The 
outlets -- categorized by the U.S. Postal Service as "commercial mail-receiving 
agents" -- have transformed themselves by expanding their array of services far 
beyond just the rental of private mail boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the mail centers now offer services such as fax, word processing, 
message-taking and printing, services that have won them a huge following among 
small-business owners who cannot afford to outfit and staff an office. 
</P>
<P>
There are also signs that the major package and letter carriers are recognizing 
the value of the retail mail centers. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes Etc., the largest of the private mail center chains, in June 
announced a deal with United Parcel Service under which UPS would pay $11.3 
million for stock and warrants that would give it a 17% stake in Mail Boxes. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, which has not been finalized, has raised protests among Mail Boxes' 
rivals, who claim that the alliance may give Mail Boxes an unfair competitive 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The deal highlights the fact that private mail-box rental now represents only a 
small slice of the revenue pie for Mail Boxes and other national chains, 
including PostalAnnex and Pak Mail Centers of America. 
</P>
<P>
Although a major selling point for many of these operations is 24-hour access 
to private mail boxes as well as call-in services allowing clients to find out 
if they have mail waiting, the mail centers' largest source of revenue is 
package preparation and handling for such carriers as UPS, DHL and Federal 
Express. Mark-up on postage and fees for wrapping and handling packages is a 
primary profit source. 
</P>
<P>
Observers credit the growth explosion in small businesses, which now account 
for more than half of private mail centers' revenue, and a corresponding 
decline in service quality at U.S. post offices, for making the industry 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity has helped drive the industry's growth from 1,000 outlets in 
1979 to more than 6,000 outlets nationwide today, according to Associated Mail 
and Parcel Centers, an Albuquerque-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason the industry has developed is because the consumer had 
desperately needed a more service-oriented and convenience-oriented program 
than what the post offices and major carriers have to offer," said John E. 
Kelly, president of Pak Mail Centers of America, an Aurora, Colo.-based 
200-outlet chain that is the nation's second-largest private mail center 
network. 
</P>
<P>
"The packaging and shipping industry has become the travel agent for packages," 
Kelly said. "If you had a mounted mako shark you want mailed back home, what 
would you do? You take it to a Pak Mail store because they can make all 
arrangements to get it crated and shipped. Otherwise, the average consumer 
wouldn't even know where to start." 
</P>
<P>
The industry is not through growing, which is why Wall Street is paying 
attention. Nationwide, there should be room for a minimum 15,000 to 17,000 
private mail outlets, said Alex. Brown &amp; Sons analyst Christopher Vroom. 
Boosters say 20,000 outlets -- half as many as there are U.S. Postal Service 
branches -- is not an unreasonable projection. 
</P>
<P>
International expansion is also planned. Mail Boxes Etc. recently opened its 
first franchise in Mexico and will soon be selling European franchises as well. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the private mail centers are located in strip shopping centers with 
easy parking and access, two keys to a location's success. Centers located in 
giant shopping malls, on the other hand, have proven less successful because of 
the distances customers must carry packages. Nevertheless, Pak Mail has signed 
a deal to open up as many as 300 of its outlets in Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. 
stores, many of them situated in shopping malls, over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
No company illustrates the success of the private mail center concept more than 
San Diego-based Mail Boxes Etc., the industry's leading franchiser, which has 
grown from 57 outlets in 1983 to more than 1,300 today. Mail Boxes, which is 
now adding an average of one new franchise every day, is at the top of Alex. 
Brown &amp; Sons' list of high-growth companies, Vroom said. Both Mail Boxes 
and Pak Mail stock is traded over the counter. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes is widely credited with inventing the concept of the private postal 
office as a business communications center. Company President A. W. (Tony) De 
Sio said the franchising strategy adopted by Mail Boxes and others has changed 
the industry from a fragmented one with hundreds of tiny firms to one that 
someday will be dominated by national chains, much as 7-Eleven dominates the 
convenience store industry. 
</P>
<P>
One third of all mail and package handling centers are now franchised by chains 
such as Mail Boxes Etc. and PostalAnnex, both headquartered in San Diego, and 
Pak Mail. Ten years ago, virtually all private mail outlets were independent 
and company owned. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes began as a chain of company-owned stores but found out that a 
business with such a heavy customer-service orientation thrived when the owner 
was on the premises supervising day-to-day operations. For that reason -- and 
to facilitate rapid growth of the essential national network -- the firm turned 
to franchising. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy is starting to pay off. Mail Boxes Etc.'s system-wide revenue 
increased to $338.4 million for the year ended April 30, up 44% from the 
previous year. Company revenue was $25.7 million for the year, up 33% from 
fiscal 1989. Its net income was $1.5 million, down from $2.4 million the 
previous year, a decline that reflects a one-time charge of $2.8 million to 
settle litigation in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Business-to-business services" such as the private mail handling outlets are 
currently among the fastest-growing franchising categories," said Peter Holt of 
the International Franchising Assn., a trade group based Washington. "Mail 
Boxes is an excellent example of a company that identified a niche that wasn't 
being serviced and built a franchise around it." "These are the businesses that 
basically are geared to helping the businessman getting their products mailed. 
. . . They also target a consumer who hates the lines at the post office," Holt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The turnkey cost of a Mail Boxes franchise runs about $65,000, about half of 
which the firm will finance through equipment-leasing programs. That start-up 
cost includes an initial franchise fee of $19,500. Each franchisee also pays 
out 7% of store revenue in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of its stock deal with Mail Boxes, UPS would have the right to 
raise its stake to 35% after one year and to appoint a board director. 
</P>
<P>
The deal sent ripples through the private mail industry and beyond. Mail Boxes 
executives, who say UPS packaging represents 40% of a typical franchisee's 
revenue, have touted the investment as the precursor of an undefined "strategic 
relationship." Just what the relationship could entail be has not been made 
clear although some kind of joint marketing effort is likely, company officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
UPS may even buy the rest of Mail Boxes stock someday, which would help give 
the package carrier the retail presence it now lacks. Long-distance letter and 
package carriers have felt the need for accessible retail outlets, but most 
have been unable to make them profitable, analysts say, pointing to problems 
that Federal Express has had with its retail counters. 
</P>
<P>
"It took eight years, but UPS finally realized that private post offices are 
increasingly becoming the place for pickup and delivery of packages," said 
Blaine Roberts, president of Morgan Roberts &amp; Co., a La Jolla investment 
firm whose clients hold more than 5% of Mail Boxes Etc. shares. Knowledge of 
the relationship UPS has with Mail Boxes Etc. "can drive customers into the 
stores, letting UPS centralize their pickups." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, UPS says it acquired the Mail Boxes Etc. stock for investment 
purposes only and has no intention of taking control. The $12.4-billion 
corporation said the Mail Boxes Etc. investment is just one of many that it has 
made in transportation and communications stocks, although UPS acknowledged 
that the Mail Boxes stock buy is its first in a commercial mail service. 
</P>
<P>
The news of UPS' investment raised the hackles of Mail Boxes' competitors. 
Despite UPS' assurances to other private mail centers that its investment will 
not cause it to give Mail Boxes Etc. any break on rates, many rivals worry that 
an alliance with UPS, which controls 95% of the nation's package volume, would 
give Mail Boxes Etc. an unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Baer, president of Associated Mail and Parcel Centers trade group, said his 
group has sent letters to legislators and government agencies protesting that 
the relationship could lead to unfair trade practices, given UPS' "monopoly on 
ground parcel shipping." 
</P>
<P>
"The scenario could be that (UPS) will somehow market this relationship, 
possibly end up acquiring Mail Boxes Etc.," Baer said. "UPS could be after a 
combination that will control the delivery of packages through UPS and the 
receipt of packages through Mail Boxes Etc." 
</P>
<P>
"What this is going to do is damage small businesses and by doing so hurt the 
general public." 
</P>
<P>
Neither has the Postal Service overlooked the deal. Richard Strasser, senior 
assistant postmaster general, said that the deal "makes it a little challenging 
(because) it gives them a retail presence and avoids them having to run it 
themselves. . . . It will help them in competition with us and with Federal 
Express."

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: INVESTING IN STOCKS OR BONDS FOR $1,000 OR LESS

<TEXT>
<P>
Have you ever had only about $1,000 to invest and wondered if you couldn't earn 
a higher return on it than in a crummy savings or checking account? 
</P>
<P>
Many people often assume that buying stocks, bonds or precious metals with so 
little money isn't too smart. They figure that they can't get adequate 
diversification or that brokerage commissions or other fees will consume too 
high a proportion of the investment. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, these people are wrong. There are many ways you can invest $1,000 
that will not only give you a decent profit potential but also diversification 
and low transaction costs. 
</P>
<P>
Many mutual funds allow low minimum initial investments and don't carry sales 
charges. In fact, you can put together a $1,000 portfolio -- including stock 
and bond mutual funds, real estate and gold -- that in some ways is as 
diversified as portfolios of giant pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
Here are various elements that can be included in your diversified, low-cost 
$1,000 portfolio: 
</P>
<P>
* Savings bonds. You can buy a Series EE savings bond from a bank for as little 
as $25. That will get you a bond with a $50 face value. And there is no fee or 
service charge. 
</P>
<P>
This bond can help finance your kids' college education. That's because 
proceeds are free of federal tax if used for college tuition, provided you meet 
certain income and other criteria. 
</P>
<P>
* Zero-coupon bonds. Here's another way to save for your kids' college 
education. Zero-coupon Treasury bonds can be bought for less than $1,000, 
depending on the maturity. Like savings bonds, they are sold at a discount from 
face value; you earn interest by getting the full face value at maturity. (But 
be aware that this accrued interest is taxable each year, even though you don't 
receive it in cash.) 
</P>
<P>
Got no kids? If you want some excitement, buy zeroes anyway. They are one of 
the best investments for a recession or a period of declining interest rates, 
because they shoot up in price when interest rates fall. You can buy zeroes 
through mutual funds. Benham Capital Management, (800) 472-3389, and Scudder, 
Stevens &amp; Clark, (800) 225-2470, offer such funds with $1,000 minimums. 
</P>
<P>
* Certificates of deposit. Several banks and savings and loans nationwide offer 
CDs for as little as $250 that are among the highest yielding in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
John Hanson Savings of Beltsville, Md., (800) 448-5151, offered an annual 
effective yield of 8.47% on a six-month CD with a $1,000 minimum. That was the 
second-highest yield in the nation, according to 100 Highest Yields, a North 
Palm Beach, Fla., newsletter.

* Money market mutual funds. Most mutual funds carry minimum investment 
requirements of $1,000 or less. Some have minimums of $500 or less. And 
virtually all charge no sales fees. 
</P>
<P>
* Stock and bond mutual funds. Many fund companies are raising their required 
minimum initial investments to spread their costs over more dollars invested. 
</P>
<P>
But many no-load (no sales commission) mutual funds are still available with 
minimum investments of $1,000 or less. One firm, Twentieth Century Investors, 
(800) 345-2021, even has no minimum initial investment requirement at all. It 
offers several growth-stock funds that have been among the top performing 
equity funds in recent years.

domestic stocks and bonds. (For example, it avoids firms in defense, tobacco 
and liquor.) 
</P>
<P>
If stocks aren't your thing, there also are numerous bond funds available for 
low minimums. They invest in everything from high-risk junk bonds to low-risk

</P>
<P>
* Gold. You can buy gold bullion coins, including American Eagles or Canadian 
Maple Leafs, in sizes as small as one-tenth of an ounce. That will cost you 
about one-tenth the market price of an ounce of gold -- plus service charges 
and a slight premium. 
</P>
<P>
But if you really want to play the gold market, you might be better off buying 
a mutual fund investing in gold stocks and the metal itself. These will give 
you more bang for your buck, with no sales charges if you buy a no-load fund.

* Real estate. You can't buy property or buildings that cheap. But you can buy 
shares in a real estate investment trust investing in office buildings, 
shopping centers, warehouses and other commercial property. Their shares are 
traded on stock exchanges.

80 AMERICAN HOSTAGES FLY OUT OF IRAQ; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES: HUNDREDS OF WESTERN WOMEN DEPART WITH THEIR CHILDREN. HUSBANDS ARE 
LEFT BEHIND. BAGHDAD CALLS IT A HUMANITARIAN AIRLIFT.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid the tears of families torn in half and the memories of a month in Iraqi 
captivity, hundreds of Western women and children, including at least 80 
Americans, flew to freedom today in what was billed as a massive humanitarian 
airlift by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage release came after midnight and after a maddening series of delays, 
agonizing farewells and intensive international diplomacy, but it left behind 
thousands of American, European and Japanese men who are either held under 
military guard at strategic installations or simply barred from leaving Iraqi 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
In a few cases, Western women who were told to report with their husbands to 
pick up their exit visas had to watch their men taken away by security 
officials, presumably adding to President Hussein's human shield. 
</P>
<P>
"They basically traded the husband for the visa," said one Western diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
"In actual fact, we're not free," said Hillary Westwood, a British hostage who 
had to leave her husband behind at the strategic Iraqi camp where they were 
held for 11 of their 30 days under armed guard. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still going to be hostages in (Britain) -- hostage to everything that 
happens here." 
</P>
<P>
Standing beside her as she waited in the departure line at Saddam International 
Airport, fellow Briton Kirsty Norman added, "This isn't going to be over for us 
until everybody gets back." 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Bazner, who was en route to her in-laws' home in Palm Desert, Calif., in 
part because her husband, Kevin, had appealed personally to President Hussein 
for the release of the women and children on an international broadcast by 
Iraqi Television, said simply that she needs time to think before she speaks. 
</P>
<P>
"For now," she said, "our main purpose is to get our children to safety." 
</P>
<P>
There were only a handful of men among the evacuees, most of them among the 26 
Americans hiding out in Kuwait whose release was secured by a persistent Jesse 
Jackson during a Friday night meeting with President Hussein and continuous 
negotiations in Kuwait throughout Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who visited both Iraq and Kuwait as an official state guest of the 
Iraqi government, made a second trip to the Iraqi-occupied capital of Kuwait 
city on Saturday to collect the sick Americans from the besieged U.S. Embassy 
compound there. His late return to Baghdad delayed all of the hostages' 
departure by an additional four hours. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a window of hope, and it must be expanded," Jackson told a wire 
service reporter at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was encouraged by his meetings with Hussein, whom he found ready to 
talk. "When people are willing to talk, that is a step in the first direction," 
Jackson said. "There must be a cooling of the rhetoric in this quest for 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who took to Kuwait city several Western journalists from Baghdad and 
three film crews from his new television program who had accompanied him to 
Iraq, also flew out of Baghdad with 237 released detainees journeying to Paris, 
London and Washington aboard a state-owned Iraqi Airways Boeing 747. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there were three evacuation flights Saturday, the principal one being 
the Iraqi Airways flight that Baghdad had requested as a last-minute 
negotiating point so it could pick up Iraqis stranded in Paris and London. The 
Iraqi government did, however, fly all 237 detainees home free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
A chartered Airbus of Lufthansa, West Germany's flag carrier, took out an 
additional 260 women and children, among them Americans and Europeans from 10 
countries who had not been detained at camps, factories, refineries, power 
plants and storage depots but were stuck in Baghdad under presidential orders 
barring most foreigners from leaving the country. 
</P>
<P>
A third Iraqi-financed flight took 68 Japanese women and children detainees on 
an Iraqi Airways Boeing 727 to a waiting Japan Air Lines flight in Amman, 
Jordan. According to the Japanese Embassy in Baghdad, an additional 143 
Japanese men remain in detention at installations throughout Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and West German officials said that the flights carried up to 22 American 
women and children who had been locked up in camps and at other sites in Iraq, 
in addition to 58 American wives and children who were leaving their husbands 
and fathers behind at the families' homes in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 600 Americans were in Iraq and 2,500 more in Kuwait at the time of 
the Aug. 2 invasion that touched off the military crisis in the Persian Gulf 
and the hostage drama in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
President Hussein, who met twice in internationally telecast sessions with the 
detained hostages -- "guests" who he said were recipients of "forced 
hospitality" -- has publicly announced that they are needed as a shield to 
prevent an American air strike and a prolonged bloody conflict. His advisers 
also say that the hostages are key pressure points on American allies 
participating in the Western military buildup in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
"They are Saddam's insurance against an attack," a European military expert in 
Baghdad said of the husbands and fathers whom the released hostages were 
leaving behind on Saturday night. "Militarily, he cannot afford to let these 
people go now -- not until most of the American forces are out of the area." 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat, noting that the release was clearly timed to coincide with 
talks between U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign 
Minister Tarik Aziz in Jordan, added, "It's definitely a peace signal -- a 
peace offensive, but the West will not look at it that way. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, at Saddam International Airport on Saturday night, there was ample 
evidence of the human cost of the Iraqi president's insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
Women quietly commiserated with each other over the fate of their husbands. 
Single women wept over the men friends they had taken along to protect them as 
they were moved in detention from installation to installation. A child cried 
for her father. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the released American hostages refused to speak for the record. 
</P>
<P>
"They've fooled us so many times," one middle-aged American said of the mixed 
bag of messages they have received from their captors during the past month. 
"And then, there's our men. I don't think we'll talk much even after we get out 
of here." 
</P>
<P>
The Britons, by far the largest group of women and children with about 200 
evacuees, were far more open, though just as concerned about their husbands and 
fathers. Most asked that their husbands' names not be used, nor would most 
specify where they had been held, although all insisted that they had been well 
treated and cared for by their guards. 
</P>
<P>
"They were extremely pleasant to us, but it was bizarre," said Hillary 
Westwood, who was captured along with her friend, Caroline Johnson, and their 
husbands 
</P>
<P>
on Aug. 18 while trying to escape from Kuwait through the desert. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining their decision to make a run for it after 16 days of hiding at 
various places in Kuwait city, Westwood said, "In fact, we'd given up hope of 
ever getting out of there." 
</P>
<P>
But they gave up on their journey, as well, after encountering a desert horizon 
virtually covered with Iraqi tanks and troops, and it was on their return to 
Kuwait city that they were caught by an army patrol and taken to an Iraqi 
military camp. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to split up," she added of the decision she and her husband 
were given 45 minutes to make. "But I've got two kids in the U.K. So what 
decision do you make? Someone's got to take care of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently disclosing that some Western women and children remain hostage in 
Iraq, Westwood added that seven British women and two children in their group 
chose to stay behind with their husbands and fathers at the strategic sites. 
</P>
<P>
There were some lighter moments. Arti Lakhani, a Canadian, was en route to be 
married in the south Indian city of Madras when she became a hostage along with 
most of her 368 fellow passengers on British Airways Flight 149 when it was 
stranded in Kuwait during the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"He better still want to get married," she said with a laugh, as she sent her 
bags through the airport metal detector. 
</P>
<P>
But even Lakhani's eyes began to water when she spoke of "the three guys we 
dragged along to look after us," three men who remain under detention somewhere 
in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy to be getting out, of course," the 28-year-old British-born 
woman said. "But it's such a downside, the guys we left. You live 11 days with 
someone, and, well, you really start to care. You get close. And it's very 
difficult to let them go." 
</P>
<P>
For American attorney Debbie Willis, a 32-year-old native of Portland, Me., it 
was her husband, Jerry, she had to leave behind. And, after 3 1/2 years of 
working for a law firm in Kuwait city, it was the Kuwaiti people, too, she said 
she will miss. 
</P>
<P>
"It just looked like no one was going anywhere, and we were afraid for the 
Kuwaiti friends who were hiding us," she said in explaining their decision to 
load up their four-wheel-drive vehicle and make a dash across the desert to 
Saudi Arabia after days in hiding. Like Westwood and many other detainees, they 
were caught trying. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to be going home," she said. "I'm happy to be alive. But I'm leaving 
my husband behind, and I'm sad about it. What more can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
In other even more extraordinary cases, though, the evacuation literally tore 
entire families apart. 
</P>
<P>
Nidhal Anaim, an Iraqi-born mother of three who now lives in Los Angeles as an 
American citizen, wept uncontrollably as she hugged, kissed and caressed her 
Iraqi relatives, bidding goodby Saturday afternoon outside the U.S. Embassy, 
which served as a staging area for the American women and children going home. 
</P>
<P>
Like many Iraqi-Americans, Anaim has one foot in each of the two nations that 
are now staring each other down in a potentially explosive war of nerves, and 
she said she is deeply concerned about the safety of those she is leaving 
behind in her native Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
She came to Iraq for a month's vacation with the relatives on July 4 and was to 
return to America about the time of the Iraqi invasion, which trapped her 
between two worlds of love and loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
Asked who had come to send her off on her journey Saturday, Anaim said, "My 
mother and my father and, well, my family." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why she is returning to Los Angeles, she said, "My husband is there." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how she feels now that her nation of birth and her nation of residence 
seem poised on the brink of hostilities, she shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot think about such things right now," she said as she dried her eyes 
and hurried off to check in with embassy authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is sad. It is all just very, very sad."

U.N.-IRAQ TALKS END SOURLY; NO PROGRESS NOTED

<TEXT>
<P>
Two days of talks between U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and 
Iraq ended sourly here Saturday with a ringing Iraqi denunciation of the United 
States and of U.N. resolutions designed to force a withdrawal from conquered 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz emerged from the talks here Saturday night 
with a 10-minute no-progress monologue. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a complex and dramatic situation. Such a situation cannot be resolved 
by dramatic diplomacy. It needs patience," Aziz said, making clear that while 
he had "listened carefully" to the U.N. leader, the two had found little common 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Perez de Cuellar came to Jordan on Thursday armed with U.N. resolutions 
demanding unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of the ousted 
Kuwaiti government and the release of all hostages held by the Baghdad 
government. 
</P>
<P>
A month of unremitting regional tension appeared to ease a notch Friday, when 
Perez de Cuellar and Aziz decided to extend their talks to a second day 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After a morning round of talks between legal experts, the two diplomats met 
twice Saturday for more than four hours. As they talked, Jordanian officials 
spoke privately of progress in substantive discussions that they expected would 
continue today. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't turn out that way. On Friday, Aziz and Perez de Cuellar had shared 
the post-meeting spotlight on the steps outside Jordanian King Hussein's 
limestone royal palace here in a brief encounter with jostling reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Aziz emerged alone, standing in stiff self-righteousness to drive 
home an Iraqi position on Kuwait that has yet to contemplate the unconditional 
withdrawal demanded by an unprecedented international unanimity. 
</P>
<P>
He jabbed at the United States, a nation, he said, that "supports aggression" 
and that takes a flavor-of-the-month approach to global traumas. 
</P>
<P>
"They select an international crisis . . . and tell the world this is the most 
important thing. They do this out of their selfish policies and 
self-interests," Aziz asserted. 
</P>
<P>
He pummeled the United Nations, an organization, he said, which voted sanctions 
in "a hasty decision" that never allowed Iraq the chance to present its case. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council, Aziz said, is controlled by five major powers, some 
of "which have not been good friends of this region. . . . The Security Council 
is an international body, yes, but it is formed of governments, and those 
governments are not neutral." 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine if the Arabs had the power of veto in the Security Council. . . ," he 
pondered wistfully. "These resolutions would not have passed." 
</P>
<P>
In the United Nations, veto power is reserved to the five permanent members of 
the council, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France, 
all of which demand Iraq's unconditional withdrawal and support the use of 
forceful measures to enforce a trade blockade against the Baghdad regime. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, backed by Jordan and a minority of Arab governments, links any eventual 
withdrawal from Kuwait to the departure of foreign troops from Saudi Arabia and 
demands that any talks also resolve regional problems, not just the issue of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an Arab problem. It must be resolved by Arab means," Aziz said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Perez de Cuellar had almost nothing to say, pointing to his 
throat as he left the palace with the grimace of a sore-throated person with no 
words left. Asked by a shouting reporter if he and Aziz had discussed a 
withdrawal, the Peruvian diplomat replied hoarsely, "We discussed everything." 
The U.N. leader has scheduled a press conference here this morning before 
leaving Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, confirmed that the 
talks in Amman had produced no real progress. 
</P>
<P>
"That's our understanding," Scowcroft told reporters at Bush's vacation home in 
Kennebunkport, Me. ". . . After all, his negotiating framework is the five U.N. 
resolutions, and what he went there for was to impress upon Saddam Hussein that 
the world community has spoken. And so, unless Saddam Hussein is prepared to 
meet that framework, why, it's difficult to see how there could be very 
successful negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
The apparent sinking of Perez de Cuellar's initiative narrows the diplomatic 
search for a peaceful solution. Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet 
next Sunday with Kuwait on their minds. But the only ongoing effort that 
engages Iraq is a peace shuttle by Jordan's King Hussein. The monarch is in the 
midst of a tour of North African and West European capitals, seeking support 
for a compromise end to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, smiling Jordanian officials expressed satisfaction that the 
talks had quickly focused on concrete issues. A high Jordanian official 
contended that even as delicate an issue as Iraq's proclaimed annexation of 
Kuwait could be reversed through talks rather than threats of war. 
</P>
<P>
"In one way or another, everything is on the table," he said. "One can assume 
that substantive talks are under way and there can be some conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
One official suggested that agreement could be reached by replacing Iraqi 
troops in Kuwait with U.N. troops and American troops in Saudi Arabia with an 
all-Arab force. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein has been praised by Aziz for trying to work out an "Arab solution" 
to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The term Arab solution has become a code word for giving Iraq a facing-saving 
way out, perhaps by ceding Baghdad some Kuwaiti territory and by barring the 
return to power of the Kuwaiti royal family. 
</P>
<P>
But the unanimity implicit in the words Arab solution does not exist. A 
majority bloc of Arab countries led by Egypt and Saudi Arabia are calling for 
the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and reparation payments for 
damage.

U.S.-SOVIET GULF SUMMIT IS SET; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERPOWERS: BUSH AND GORBACHEV WILL MEET IN HELSINKI NEXT SUNDAY. ARMS CONTROL 
WILL ALSO BE ON THE TWO LEADERS' AGENDA.

<P>
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet next Sunday 
in Helsinki to discuss the crisis with Iraq, arms control and other issues, 
Bush announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The President played down suggestions that he and Gorbachev would negotiate a 
settlement of the confrontation in the Persian Gulf, trying to avoid any hint 
that the leaders of the world's two superpowers would try to impose a 
settlement on others. But the White House made clear its hope that the summit 
meeting would reinforce Iraq's sense of isolation in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's the express purpose" of the meeting, White House 
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. "But," he added, if a message of superpower 
unity against Iraq "is a product that comes out of it, that's fine with us 
because we're eager at every turn to show the solidity of world opposition." 
</P>
<P>
The summit takes on special significance because it is planned as a joint 
U.S.-Soviet effort to deal with a global crisis, the first such meeting since 
World War II. And it will put to a test the new, closer relationship that the 
two leaders agreed to form. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations to reduce armies in Europe will be a major part of the summit 
agenda, Bush said. Both sides hope to conclude the talks in time to sign a 
Europe-wide arms reduction treaty in November, but several problems remain, 
most of them involving how much to reduce military aircraft on the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
"The two heads of state need to give it a push," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, two other world trouble spots -- Cambodia and Afghanistan -- are 
likely to come up during the brief, one-day meeting, according to National 
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. 
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, 
the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France -- proposed a new Cambodian peace 
plan last week that Bush would like to discuss with Gorbachev, according to 
Fitzwater. The President would also like to talk to Gorbachev about the recent 
visit to Moscow of President Najibullah, the leader of the Soviet-backed 
government in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing the summit plans to reporters at his vacation compound here, Bush 
also denounced Iraq's on-again, off-again plans to release hostages, although 
more than 500 Westerners, including at least 80 Americans, were allowed to 
leave the country early today. Iraq's behavior has been a "despicable 
performance," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad when any American comes out of there, but there's a certain 
brutality, a certain tawdry performance in all of this," Bush said. "I don't 
like it. I don't think the world likes it." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department estimates that about 1,000 American women and children 
were stranded in Iraq and Kuwait by the invasion. Although Iraq's President 
Saddam Hussein promised that all foreign women and children would be allowed to 
leave Iraq last Wednesday, he immediately began throwing bureaucratic 
roadblocks in their path. 
</P>
<P>
In his statements Saturday, Bush repeated his pessimistic assessment of 
negotiations to solve the gulf standoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any willingness" on Iraq's part to comply with U.N. resolutions 
calling for a withdrawal from Kuwait and restoration of that country's royal 
family, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to be optimistic," he added. "But I don't want to mislead the 
American people by saying I think that there's some breakthrough at hand." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also confirmed reports that he would like to cancel billions of dollars in 
military debts that Egypt owes the United States, saying it is his "gut 
instinct" that the debt forgiveness is the proper response to Egypt's help in 
the U.S.-led campaign against Iraq. Congress would have to approve any plan to 
cancel the debt, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
The President once again praised Soviet "cooperation" with the United States in 
the Iraqi standoff and said the summit would be an "informal" and 
"unstructured" session, part of his desire to make meetings between the heads 
of the world's two nuclear superpowers more routine. 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials said that Bush is likely to press the Soviets to 
withdraw their remaining military advisers from Iraq. The Soviets have been 
reluctant to do so for fear that their citizens would become hostages. But with 
thousands of U.S. citizens still held in Iraq and Kuwait, American officials 
have grown less sympathetic with that argument. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous U.S.-Soviet summits, which often took months to arrange, 
planning for this meeting began just one week ago with a cable from Bush to 
Gorbachev. Details have been worked out in a series of telephone calls between 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
News of the summit was announced simultaneously here and in the Soviet Union, 
timed for the nightly Soviet television newscast "Vremya," which is aired at 9 
p.m. Moscow time (11 a.m. PDT). 
</P>
<P>
Because plans for the summit were so tightly held, with only four or five U.S. 
officials in on the news, none of the Administration's top Soviet policy 
experts were aware of it, officials said. Meetings to plan the actual agenda 
for the session will not begin until today. But officials added that the 
limited preparation time will be offset by the shortness of the summit. "How 
complicated can you get in one day?" one Administration Soviet expert said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said he anticipates that Bush will leave Washington for Finland on 
Saturday, stay in Helsinki that evening, meet with Gorbachev most of the day 
Sunday, then fly directly home. The President plans to stick to his other 
travel plans, which call for him to campaign this Thursday for Republican 
candidates in Kansas and Florida and on the Tuesday after he returns from the 
summit for GOP gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson in California. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, White House officials said that Bush had rejected proposals, at 
least for now, to send a high-level delegation to Amman, Jordan, to talk with 
Jordan's King Hussein about compliance with the U.N. embargo against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was "an option" that had been proposed, but "it wasn't felt that it is 
necessary," said White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk. Bush feels 
that the Jordanians are "doing a good job" with the embargo despite a 
"difficult situation," Popadiuk added. 
</P>
<P>
Other Administration officials, however, continued to indicate displeasure at 
widespread reports that suggest considerable commerce still exists by truck 
from Jordan into Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials appear to be divided on how to handle Jordan, with 
some advocating a tough line to close the remaining opening in the cordon that 
is cutting off Iraq's commerce. But others worry that a tough stance could 
threaten Jordan's stability. 
</P>
<P>
If Jordan clamps down further on Iraqi commerce, some officials fear that Iraqi 
President Hussein might try to subvert King Hussein's government and introduce 
his own troops into Jordan, dangerously widening the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's diplomatic developments took place against the background of 
continued tension at the American Embassy in Kuwait, which has been surrounded 
for a week by Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the U.S. diplomats in the embassy are still holding out despite the 
cutoff of water and power by Iraqi troops. They are staying in sporadic contact 
with the remaining Americans who are in hiding in the occupied country. 
</P>
<P>
"When the situation becomes intolerable, the ambassador will tell us that he 
has to make other arrangements," Scowcroft said. "Right now, the word from the 
ambassador is that things are difficult, but they're struggling along." 
</P>
<P>
Officials here say the embassy can hold out for about another week using stored 
water and a backup generator for electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"We will keep them there just as long as it's physically possible," Scowcroft 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With news of the summit announced, Bush headed for the golf course, trying to 
squeeze in a few last minutes of frenzied relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not good, but we're fast," Bush told onlookers as he sped around the 
course.

'REDWOOD SUMMER': IT WAS GUERRILLA WARFARE; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: PROTESTERS' ANTI-LOGGING TACTICS FAIL TO HALT NORTH COAST TIMBER 
HARVEST. ENCOUNTERS LEAVE LOGGERS RESENTFUL.

<P>
While most fall ballot battles are being fought with salvos of 30-second TV 
spots, the fight over the future of the state's forests has been waged this 
summer in a tense form of hand-to-hand campaign combat. 
</P>
<P>
With potentially drastic reforms of state logging regulations going before 
voters in Proposition 130, timber companies felled trees as quickly as their 
controversial harvest plans were approved by state officials. 
</P>
<P>
A small band of students, retirees and full-time environmental activists 
organized by the radical Earth First! movement responded by trying to inhibit 
the harvest by using civil disobedience, backwoods confrontation and 
conventional protest. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the activities were known as "Redwood Summer," in honor of the 
"Freedom Summer" civil rights movement of the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
With equal measures of guerrilla theater and guerrilla war, Redwood Summer saw 
as few as one and as many as 1,500 activists dress as owls and sing protest 
songs, chain themselves to heavy equipment and block logging roads, suspend 
themselves by wires above state highways and stand between angry tree fallers 
and ancient redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
As Redwood Summer draws to a close this weekend with a two-day rally and 
"Redwoodstock" concert along the Eel River south of Eureka, the early dreams of 
stopping the timber industry clearly failed to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
But participants believe they slowed the rate of harvest, drew attention to 
timber issues in vote-rich Southern California -- and even swayed some local 
loggers to support reforms that would ban the current practice of "mining 
forests" by cutting down old trees as much as twice as fast as new ones can 
take their place. 
</P>
<P>
"The actual small number of trees that we saved by standing in front of them is 
not significant," said activist Paul Chapman, 21, of New York. "It's nice and 
sentimental, but I don't think in the long run it is as important as what we've 
done to raise the issue" in the minds of Southern Californians, whose numerous 
votes ultimately will decide Proposition 130. 
</P>
<P>
"For a hundred or something years, logging went unnoticed and unchecked, and 
they cut down 95% of the ancient redwoods," said Chapman, who earned academic 
credit at Antioch College in Ohio for participating in the protests. "Now this 
process is not going to go unnoticed. . . . The whole country knows at least 
some of what is going on here." 
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives respond that the demonstrators themselves don't know 
what is going on. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of being told how to care for a forest environment by individuals 
and groups who have no training nor understanding of modern forestry," said 
Mary A. Bullwinkel of the Pacific Lumber Co., a target of protesters because it 
is the largest private owner of old-growth redwoods and one of the most 
vigorous harvesters. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us have lived on the North Coast for a number of years," she said in a 
written statement. "The summer protesters chose to invade our home and tell us 
how to run our lives. We don't like that and are resentful." 
</P>
<P>
The activists, who have come from as far as Wisconsin and Ohio, frequently cite 
a report from the California Department of Forestry that, in the 1980s, old 
trees were cut down in Humboldt and Mendocino counties -- the prime redwood 
counties -- at a rate two to three times as fast as new trees could grow to 
replace them. 
</P>
<P>
The logging industry claims that recent concern over protecting rare and 
endangered species, like the northern spotted owl, has slowed the harvest and 
thrown hundreds of people out of work. But the evidence is mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Harvests dipped slightly in 1989, but still were the third-highest level in 
history, according to the Western Wood Products Assn. California timber tax 
revenue, collected on the number of trees felled, increased by about 6.5% 
during the most recent 12-month period for which figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
The forestry department also reports that 95% of the estimated original 2 
million acres of virgin redwoods have been cut down; of the 100,000 acres that 
remain, 80,000 acres are protected in parks and the remainder is in private 
hands and available for harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the area cut has sprouted vigorous new redwoods, but biologists 
disagree about the value of this "second growth" as habitat for such rare and 
endangered species like the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet and red tree 
vole. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Redwood Summer actions have focused on saving what old-growth 
redwoods remain along the North Coast. With the exception of a small stand in 
the hills along the Mendocino coast, cutting generally has been delayed only a 
few days by the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Lasko, 20, a UC Irvine drama student from Monrovia, said she was 
"very disappointed" to learn that shortly after she was arrested for 
trespassing and briefly jailed, loggers cut a grove of trees she and others had 
spent three days hiking into the woods to try to save. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to ask myself, 'Was it worth arrest?' " she said after a brief swim in 
Madden Creek to escape the blazing late-summer heat that has afflicted the 
demonstrators' makeshift camp. "I didn't want to do a symbolic arrest. I wanted 
to stop the cutting. . . . But they cut anyway. They don't care." 
</P>
<P>
She said her disappointment was especially bitter because the tree fallers she 
encountered in the forest were sympathetic to her cause, even as they disagreed 
with her tactics. 
</P>
<P>
But not all workers were so friendly. Redwood Summer activists said some 
workers threw eggs, spat upon and verbally threatened them. During one action 
in the woods, they said some workers threw rocks at them and hit one activist 
with an ax handle. 
</P>
<P>
Activists have filed charges with police in several such incidents, but no 
arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
Timber company representatives and local politicians accuse the activists of 
spiking trees, spreading nails on logging roads and sabotaging heavy equipment. 
The activists, who required special nonviolence training for all participants, 
deny the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
However, there has been dissent in the movement. Two members quit when 
activists disrupted a meeting between industry leaders and Humboldt State 
University staff. When allowed to speak, activists tried to make a citizen's 
arrest of a timber company president. As he fled, Redwood Summer demonstrators 
rocked and jumped on his car; when he drove off anyway, they accused him of 
trying to run them down. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 146 Redwood Summer-related arrests made in Humboldt County, most were 
for trespassing and other nonviolent misdemeanors, the Sheriff's Department 
said. Other arrests have been made in Mendocino and in Marin County, where the 
Pacific Lumber Co. headquarters is located. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Balz was one of those arrested in Mendocino County. A Michigan native and 
Stanford graduate, Balz, 21, joined Redwood Summer because he said regular 
protests and political action were not working fast enough to save the 
remaining virgin redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sick of just demonstrating. I wanted to try direct action," said Balz, 
who delayed taking a job at an organic farm to join the anti-logging actions. 
"When you feel about this the way we do, it's not enough to say, 'This is my 
big political act, holding a sign and getting spat on.' You want to stand in 
front of the chain saws."

<P>
As classes resume this week, the failure of Gov. George Deukmejian and the 
Legislature to agree on a school funding plan has left school officials up and 
down the state wondering how much money they have to spend this year. 
</P>
<P>
After the collapse of once-promising negotiations late Friday, Deukmejian 
blamed the failure on State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig and 
California Teachers Assn. President Ed Foglia -- who both blamed Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
In the governor's weekly radio talk Saturday, he said spending on kindergarten 
through 12th-grade education has increased by 65%, adjusted for inflation, 
during his eight years in office. Yet, "the whining and complaining and cries 
of poverty from much of the school establishment continue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian blamed Honig and Foglia for scuttling his $220-million proposal to 
reduce the student-to-teacher ratio in California's overcrowded classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Honig responded that Deukmejian was so "stubbornly determined to get the 
teachers" that he refused to accept a compromise that had wide acceptance in 
the state's education community and among legislators in both parties. 
</P>
<P>
The governor and his aides are "the gang that can't shoot straight," the 
schools chief said. "They aimed at the teachers and they hit the kids." 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't any leadership, there wasn't any compassion" on Deukmejian's 
part, Foglia said. "He is a very stubborn individual, whose main interest seems 
to be . . . making sure teachers don't get any more money." 
</P>
<P>
While the governor was swapping insults with Honig and Foglia, local school 
officials were trying to figure out how much money they will have available for 
this school year. 
</P>
<P>
Their dilemma is whether to spend all of the money they now are receiving from 
state Controller Gray Davis, checks that reflect the 4.76% cost-of-living 
adjustment increase for schools that was voted by the Legislature, or only the 
3% included in the final budget Deukmejian signed on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the difference between these two cost-of-living figures amounts to 
about $355 million. In the Los Angeles Unified School District, by far the 
state's largest, the difference would be about $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Schrager, a budget officer for the Los Angeles schools, said the district 
will spend at the 4.76% level because it needs the full amount to balance this 
year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We're betting on Gray Davis," Schrager said of Davis' decision to ignore the 
governor's 3% cost-of-living increase figure and pay schools at the higher 
4.76% rate. Schrager said that he believes Davis has the legal authority to pay 
the higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
But other school districts are taking a more cautious approach. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Payzant, superintendent of schools in San Diego, said that system will use 
the 3% figure because "that appears to be the law, as we understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of several school districts said they will wait for further 
clarification before deciding which figure to use. 
</P>
<P>
Because the dispute involves two state constitutional officers -- the governor 
and the controller -- "the courts are going to have to tell us what the COLA 
(cost of living) is," Payzant predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a dozen Republican state senators have asked state Atty. Gen. John 
K. Van de Kamp to investigate the Davis school payments, an action they 
describe in a letter as "not only unwise but illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Several times during intense talks that continued all last week, it appeared 
that state Sens. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and Becky Morgan (R-Los Altos 
Hills) and Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) had succeeded in negotiating a 
compromise between the governor and the education groups. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement foundered on the cost-of-living issue. Deukmejian insisted on 
an unequivocal statement that the hike would be 3%, no matter what was done on 
some of the other matters in dispute. But the education leaders, especially 
Honig and the CTA leadership, were unwilling to agree to that. 
</P>
<P>
The $500 million that was held back by Deukmejian includes the difference 
between the two cost-of-living rates, plus another $200 million that Deukmejian 
set aside when he signed the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this money -- $189 million -- was to be used for class-size reduction, 
which would have made a slight dent in California's pupil-teacher ratio, second 
highest in the nation after Utah. The budget does include $31 million to be 
used for class-size reduction. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Saturday, the governor said it was "sad that the legislative 
majority couldn't summon the courage to stand up to" CTA and Honig, "who want 
to put virtually all of the new school money into higher salaries at the 
expense of smaller classes." 
</P>
<P>
However, both Honig and Foglia said $200 million for class size reduction -- 
only $20 million less than the governor was seeking -- was part of the final 
compromise offer the education group made on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no agreement on major school funding, the Legislature passed 
a few bills on lesser education issues. 
</P>
<P>
A new incentive program for school districts that fully utilize classroom space 
by moving to a year-round schedule was approved. Of the $27 million included in 
the legislation, $15 million to $16 million would go to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Another bill that was sent to the governor would restore the California 
Assessment Program (CAP), the principal state instrument for measuring schools' 
progress. Deukmejian eliminated money for CAP when he signed the budget. Senate 
Minority Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno warned lawmakers Friday night that 
Deukmejian would veto the program, just as he did earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Funds for Indian education centers were contained in another bill the 
Legislature passed but legislation to restore driver training for about 300,000 
high school students each year was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 Following are highlights of actions taken by the Legislature in action late 
Friday and early Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
 ISSUE: Protecting coastal environment from major oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSAL: Tax oil companies 25 cents per barrel to create a $100-million oil 
spill prevention and cleanup fund. Centralize cleanup responsibilities in a 
single state government agency. 
</P>
<P>
ACTION: Sent to governor, who is expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
ISSUE: Damage to homes caused by major earthquake 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSAL: Tax homeowners $12 to $60 a year to create an earthquake recovery 
fund. Homeowners whose property is damaged in a quake would be eligible for at 
least $15,000 and up to $27,000 for repairs and living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
ACTION: Sent to the governor, who is expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
ISSUE: State-financed construction 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSAL: Placed on the Nov. 6 ballot nine bond issues worth $3.3 billion to 
build new prisons, jails, schools and low-cost housing as well as child-care 
centers, water treatment plants and courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
ACTION: Sent to the governor, who is expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
ISSUE: More than 60 million gallons of used motor oil disposed of annually in 
state. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSAL: Require oil manufacturers to pay the state a 5-cent deposit on each 
quart of motor oil sold. Motorists who bring used oil to a certified oil 
collection center would get back 5 cents a quart. Shops that change motorists' 
oil would receive the deposit money in return for agreeing to accept used oil 
from the general public. 
</P>
<P>
ACTION: Sent to the governor, whose position is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
ISSUE: 5 million Californians lack health insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSAL: Create a program requiring employers to pay a health care tax or 
provide a minimal package of medical benefits for their workers. Enact new 
rules to make insurance more affordable to small businesses and control the 
increases in doctors' fees and hospital rates. Legislation would be subject to 
approval of financing package by Legislature in 1991 and voters in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
ACTION: Approved by Senate-Assembly conference committee. Died in both houses, 
after governor threatened veto. 
</P>
<P>
ISSUE: About one-fourth of California drivers lack auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSAL: Create a low-cost policy for good drivers by dropping requirement 
that all motorists carry liability insurance that pays damages for "pain and 
suffering." Drivers would still be obligated to carry insurance that pays for 
property damage and medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
ACTION: Passed in the Assembly. Died in Senate Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
ISSUE: Some politicians think state has less clout in selecting presidential 
candidates because its June primary election is among the last held in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSAL: Hold primary earlier -- the Tuesday after the first Monday in March. 
Ban ballot initiatives from the presidential primary ballot. 
</P>
<P>
ACTION: Failed in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
ISSUE: Legislature's education budget contained 4.76% cost-of-living increase 
for schools while governor allowed 3%. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSAL: Increase cost-of-living payments to schools and create a program to 
reduce class size in selected subjects. 
</P>
<P>
ACTION: Negotiations collapsed. Neither house voted.

ARSON FIRE DESTROYS 4 ARROWHEAD HOMES, BLACKENS 17 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Four mountain homes were destroyed and four others damaged when an arson fire 
swept across a hillside at Lake Arrowhead early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze caused an estimated $1 million in damage and blackened 17 acres of 
forest near the houses, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
Two young men received minor injuries battling one residential blaze, 
firefighters said. One resident, Bob Bailey, said neighbors told him the 
injured men were among a group of seven people "who seemed to come out of 
nowhere and were all over the place helping everyone; knocking on people's 
doors to wake them up, attaching hoses and starting them up, using shovels to 
clear brush and just generally helping out." 
</P>
<P>
Arrowhead Fire District Capt. Pat O'Kelly said that when the first firefighters 
arrived "the whole hillside was ablaze . . . there were electrical lines arcing 
everywhere and the homes at the bottom were already gone." 
</P>
<P>
About 150 firefighters from six agencies brought the blaze under control about 
three hours after the 12:11 a.m. alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Carmer, an Arrowhead fire investigator, said the fire, which started in 
a home still under construction, was "definitely arson." She declined to give 
details. 
</P>
<P>
O'Kelly called it "the most destructive fire in memory" at Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
A retired physician who lives nearby, Bob Carpenter, said, "I had just turned 
off the television and looked outside and said to my wife, Carol, 'It's awfully 
bright orange out there.' In the short time it took me to get to the door, the 
lights started flickering and everything was on fire out there." 
</P>
<P>
The injured were identified by neighbors as Steve Blackwood, 20, one of three 
brothers who were among the group aiding neighbors, and Paul Defore, 20. Both 
suffered smoke inhalation and hand burns, said a spokesman for Mountains 
Community Hospital in Lake Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen families evacuated from the path of the fire were temporarily housed at 
the Lake Arrowhead Hilton Resort. Hotel manager George Koplanis said that 
viewed from the hotel the blaze "was just one big fireball." 
</P>
<P>
After a helicopter flight over the burned area, Fred Nyerick of the Arrowhead 
Fire District said: "The area looked like it had been napalmed. There was a 
wide burned swath three houses wide up the mountain." 
</P>
<P>
O'Kelly said two of the destroyed homes appeared unoccupied and vacant lots 
dotted much of the hillside. Fire companies narrowly saved many other homes 
above the 27700 block of Alpen Drive, he said.

Arrowhead fire -- The Times reported incorrectly Sunday that a San Bernardino 
County Fire Agency investigator said a weekend blaze that destroyed four homes 
in Lake Arrowhead was "definitely arson." The official said only that there was 
an arson investigation. A spokesman for the Arrowhead Fire District, Paul 
Nyerick, said investigators have found the point of origin of the fire "but the 
cause is undetermined, with suspicious circumstances."

THE LEGISLATURE ADJOURNS; 
</P>
<P>
STRICT LAW MANDATING AUTO INSURANCE TO EXPIRE ON JAN. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mandatory auto insurance law under which hundreds of thousands of 
California drivers have had their licenses suspended in the last three years 
was not extended by the Legislature before it adjourned Saturday and is likely 
to lapse on Jan. 1, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier mandatory insurance law, which requires drivers to submit proof of 
having liability coverage only after having an accident, will remain on the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
The law requiring that all motorists stopped by police for traffic violations 
show proof of insurance -- which meant much tougher enforcement of the 
mandatory rule -- will expire at the end of the year unless the Legislature 
takes emergency action to continue it when it convenes a new session in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
The chairmen of both the Assembly and Senate insurance committees said this is 
not expected. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), who authored the 1985 law for stiffer mandatory 
insurance enforcement, only to see it challenged in court and delayed until 
late 1987 -- said he decided that because the Legislature had failed to provide 
for an affordable no-frills policy, it would be unfair to extend his law beyond 
its prescribed sunset at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts by legislators and Gov. George Deukmejian to reach a compromise on 
low-cost policies, priced from $180 to $600 a year, fell victim to disputes 
between powerful insurer and trial lawyer lobbies, and never came up for action 
in the closing days of the session. Lawyers, in particular, objected to any 
changes that would reduce a person's right to sue or recover damages for pain 
and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
A report by the state Department of Motor Vehicles estimates that 25%, or about 
5 million, California motorists are uninsured. In many traffic courts, license 
suspensions because of failure to carry insurance are the most frequent actions 
taken. In parts of Los Angeles' south and east sides, the uninsured rate is 
believed to exceed 80%. 
</P>
<P>
Recent action taken by insurers who run the assigned risk auto insurance system 
to stop enrolling drivers with good records had the effect of drastically 
increasing insurance prices in urban areas for such drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said that he fears the number of uninsured motorists may now soar even 
higher. He said this is preferable to forcing many low-income drivers to choose 
between paying for food or shelter and buying auto insurance.

GULF WATCH: DAY 31; 
</P>
<P>
A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
President Bush announced that he will meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev next Sunday in Helsinki to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis and other 
issues. Bush also said he saw no evidence that Iraq was ready to respond to 
world pressure and pull out of Kuwait. In Amman, Jordan, two days of talks 
between U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign 
Minister Tarik Aziz ended sourly with a ringing Iraqi denunciation of the 
United States and of U.N. resolutions designed to force a withdrawal from 
conquered Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of Western women and children flew out of Baghdad to 
freedom in what was billed as a massive humanitarian airlift by Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces dig in at new, forward positions. The recent moves closer to the 
Kuwait and Iraqi borders have both bolstered defensive lines and vastly 
improved offensive capabilities. Until last week, the United States would have 
been almost entirely dependent on air firepower tocounter an Iraqi invasion of 
Saudi Arabia since most ground forces were in positions about 200 miles from 
the Saudi-Kuwait border. 
</P>
<P>
More troops continued to arrive in the region. Marine Maj. Gen. John Hopkins 
said Saturday that the Marine force in Saudi Arabia -- now about 15,000 strong 
-- would be tripled within two weeks. More than 100,000 troops, including those 
aboard dozens of ships, are in the region or on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Trade Front: 
</P>
<P>
Despite President Bush's assertion that the amount of goods reaching Iraq 
through Jordan has been reduced to a "trickle," a new State Department report 
says there is still heavy traffic using that route in defiance of U.N. 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Crisis Indicators: 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. troops on the ground: 50,000-plus 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. sailors aboard ships in region: 35,000 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. ships in region or en route: 70 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. reservists to be mobilized: up to 49,703 
</P>
<P>
* Iraqi troops in/near Kuwait: 265,000 
</P>
<P>
* Iraqi tanks in Kuwait: 1,500 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. diplomats remaining in Kuwait: 11 
</P>

U.S. CONGRESSMEN IN GULF REITERATE INTENT TO DRIVE IRAQ OUT OF KUWAIT; 
</P>
<P>
BIPARTISANSHIP: MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES SIGNAL POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR AMERICAN 
EFFORT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A blue-ribbon mission of American Congress members delivered assurances 
Saturday of political staying power for the U.S.-led effort to force Iraq out 
of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"There is tremendous support in Congress and among the American people for what 
President Bush has done," House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt said on a 
midday tour of the La Salle, command ship of the Persian Gulf-based Middle East 
Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
Heading a bipartisan delegation of 22 members of Congress, the Missouri 
Democrat was expected to deliver the same message Saturday night to Sheik Isa 
ibn Salman al Khalifa, ruler of this small island nation, now bristling with 
foreign armaments. The House mission will make further stops in the gulf region 
and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats and Republicans alike said political support for the American effort 
is solid, and none saw it as an issue in this fall's elections. "The President 
has support on both sides of the aisle," insisted Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, 
an Orange County Republican. "But one issue may come up," added the 
budget-focused congressman. "Who's going to pay for it all?" 
</P>
<P>
As the confrontation with Iraq developed over the past month, some gulf state 
officials have expressed nagging concerns that the American commitment might 
flag in a drawn-out standoff. But they have been buoyed by the continuing 
buildup of U.S. and allied forces and now speak in hawkish terms. 
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and other gulf states have opened their territory to foreign forces, 
and, according to military sources, American combat planes are now operating 
from the semi-secret Sheik Isa air base on Bahrain. No official confirmation 
has been made, but the forces are known to include F-16 fighters and Marine 
Corps aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
As the Congress members toured the La Salle, the command ship Blue Ridge, newly 
arrived from the Philippines, was docked at Manama's main port. The Blue Ridge 
is the flag vessel of Vice Adm. H. H. Mauz, who now heads U.S. Navy forces 
ringing the Arabian Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, in shirt-sleeves as were 
many of the visitors in the sizzling summer heat of the gulf, told reporters: 
</P>
<P>
"The support is there for the long haul. The American public does not object to 
deployments abroad. They do object when people are getting killed with no 
objective in sight." 
</P>
<P>
The Wisconsin Democrat suggested the objective was clear in the gulf -- force 
the army of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he expected a long-term U.S. military presence in the region if 
the Iraqis withdraw, Aspin said it depends on the outcome of the confrontation. 
If Hussein is somehow toppled, he said, there will be no need for a major 
foreign presence in the region. If the Iraqi president retains power in 
Baghdad, "there will be a need for some sort of military force." He suggested 
it could be a multinational force, including Americans, in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dante B. Fascell, the Florida Democrat who chairs the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, said the few complaints he has received on the massive American 
military commitment have come from families of activated military reservists. 
</P>
<P>
Fascell, who represents a heavily Jewish district in Miami and Miami Beach, 
answered a question about the Israeli position on the conflict by saying: 
"Nobody can step into the Israelis' shoes in what they regard as necessary to 
the defense of their country." But, he added, if the confrontation threatens to 
break into open conflict, the American-led multinational force, not the 
Israelis, "needs to speak first." 
</P>
<P>
A delegation of American senators arrived in Bahrain on Saturday night and will 
review the situation with American military officers and Bahraini officials 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd was visiting nearby Qatar, 
which last week became the last gulf state to accept foreign troops on its soil 
in the crisis. He said the Qatari government has approved British plans to 
permit Oman-based Jaguar fighter-bombers to use Qatari airfields.

WAR OF NERVES TESTS DIPLOMATS AT EMBASSIES

A week after they were ordered to clear out, diplomats at nearly 30 embassies 
in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait remained defiant Saturday, even though their food and 
water supplies were dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
The staff at the Moroccan Embassy had been marched off at gunpoint, and several 
other embassies had suspended operations, but most of the diplomats were 
staying on despite the Iraqi harassment, according to reports reaching here. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell and 10 of his officers and staff were 
holding out at the embassy, reportedly keeping sporadic contact with the 2,000 
or more Americans trapped in Kuwait city. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi deadline for closing the embassies expired Aug. 24 at midnight, and 
the Iraqi director of information, Naji Hadithi, said the next morning, "For 
the time being, there is no use of force, and I do not think there will be any 
use of force." 
</P>
<P>
But Iraqi troops were positioned outside the U.S. Embassy and refused to permit 
anyone to leave or enter. At last report, the troops were still in place. 
</P>
<P>
Electric power and water lines to most of the major embassies have been shut 
off. In Paris, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that at the French Embassy in 
Kuwait the lights were blinking on and off like a nightclub's. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a war of nerves," he said, "a process of asphyxiation." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the embassies switched on emergency generators and have been able to 
maintain communications with their governments. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the British Foreign Office said in London that Ambassador 
Michael Weston, who observed the deadline sipping champagne at his embassy with 
three of his officers, has been able to get word out that Iraqi tanks were 
moving on the coast road outside his window. 
</P>
<P>
Ottawa's External Affairs Ministry reported that water and power had been cut 
off at the Canadian Embassy but that officers were in contact with Canadian 
nationals trapped in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"All Canadian and locally engaged staff at the embassy are reported to be 
well," a ministry spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime ordered the embassies closed down in 
recognition of his proclaimed annexation of Kuwait following the Aug. 2 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a matter of confrontation," said the Iraqi ambassador to London, 
Azmi Safiq Salihi. "Rather, it is a matter of sovereignty. By this I mean 
Kuwait is a part of Iraq, and each country can have only one embassy (in 
Baghdad) to represent it in Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan Embassy was forced to close the morning after the deadline when 
Iraqi troops intercepted its diplomats as they attempted to enter the grounds. 
The Foreign Ministry in Rabat said a soldier leveled his rifle at a diplomat 
and told him to "raise his hands and walk a long distance." 
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan spokesman said: "Diplomats were forbidden access to offices in a 
brutal manner and were told to close the embassy and leave Kuwait or else other 
measures would be taken." Morocco promptly expelled two Iraqi officials from 
Rabat in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing its deadline, the Iraqi government said that officials who failed 
to comply would lose their diplomatic immunity, would be stripped of all 
privileges and become subject to detention.

<P>
About 24 hours before the announcement of next Sunday's U.S.-Soviet summit, a 
reporter asked Mikhail S. Gorbachev about his travel plans. "I will limit my 
trips abroad to the minimum in this period -- to the possible minimum," the 
Soviet president replied after two days of meetings on how to salvage the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
So on Saturday evening there was general surprise when state-run television 
broadcast a one-sentence bulletin saying Gorbachev will travel to Helsinki one 
week from today to discuss "international and bilateral issues" with President 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its unexpectedness, the latest event in U.S.-Soviet history -- 
Gorbachev's eighth meeting with an American President -- will be greeted with a 
shrug by many here. Attention is already focused on other arenas, like the 
national and Russian republic's legislatures, where as early as Monday, debate 
will open on how to halt the spiral of economic decline and institute 
market-style reforms. 
</P>
<P>
With the shortage-riddled economy now so badly off that, as one newspaper 
bitterly noted, desperate smokers gladly buy jars of cigarette butts, Gorbachev 
certainly knows he can expect little public relations capital at home from a 
hastily scheduled one-day meeting with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
However, with U.S.-Soviet ties closer than ever, Helsinki will be a timely 
occasion for the Kremlin leader to do some horse-trading to help bolster his 
own political position and seek more Western help for his reforms, which he 
admitted to reporters Friday were undergoing "serious trials." 
</P>
<P>
Since the presidents last met in June in Washington, D.C., Gorbachev's list of 
domestic woes has gotten longer. The very term Soviet Union now seems outmoded, 
as republics one by one have declared their independence or sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
The radical populist who is the leader of Russia, Boris N. Yeltsin, has rapidly 
grown in stature to the point where, to millions disappointed by the meager 
fruits of Gorbachev's perestroika, he seems a preferable, and very 
presidential, alternative. 
</P>
<P>
When he meets Bush, Gorbachev could conceivably seek to capitalize on 
tit-for-tat deals or tangible benefits for the changed line of Soviet conduct. 
Among those areas: 
</P>
<P>
* First and foremost, the Persian Gulf crisis, which has seen historic 
U.S.-Soviet cooperation and coordination to extinguish a Third World hot spot, 
but which Kremlin officials say will cost their country more than $800 million 
in lost trade with Iraq this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
* The so-called two-plus-four negotiations on German reunification, whose next 
round in Moscow on Sept. 12 is supposed to be the last, but where some issues 
remain unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
* Separate sets of disarmament negotiations in which superpower envoys are said 
to be marking time: the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) talks in Vienna and 
bilateral negotiations on cutting strategic nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
* Efforts to end conflicts in Afghanistan and Cambodia. On Cambodia, Washington 
and the Kremlin have agreed at the United Nations to what one U.S. official 
said will be an unprecedented U.N. peacekeeping operation that could cost $5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
In one area, a deal seems certain. 
</P>
<P>
At the Washington summit, Bush had agreed to grant Moscow the same tariff terms 
that the United States sets for its allies -- most favored nation status -- as 
soon as the Supreme Soviet legislature completes work on a law to allow 
citizens to emigrate freely. 
</P>
<P>
A draft of that legislation, which had originally been expected in time for 
Gorbachev's trip to Washington, is now ready for submission at the Supreme 
Soviet session that begins immediately after the Helsinki summit, and doubtless 
some member of Gorbachev's entourage will be carrying a copy to show the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
MFN status would allow Soviet products to enter the U.S. market at a lower 
tariff rate, making them more competitive and giving a boost to the Kremlin's 
campaign to sell more abroad and thus earn more convertible currency. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush has told reporters that he had suggested the third meeting 
between himself and Gorbachev, the location -- the Finnish capital about 600 
miles northwest of Moscow -- was obviously selected for Gorbachev's 
convenience. 
</P>
<P>
With three different political institutions about to begin meetings that could 
prove crucial -- the Russian Parliament on Monday, the Russian Communist Party 
on Tuesday and the Soviet legislature on Sept. 10 -- Gorbachev will be able to 
meet with the Americans and get back home quickly for any necessary damage 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush said Saturday that he didn't foresee Moscow playing a mediating 
role in the Persian Gulf crisis, the different postures taken by the 
superpowers often seem like a diplomatic version of "good cop, bad cop." For 
example, the United States sent aircraft carriers to the Persian Gulf, and 
Gorbachev sent a special envoy. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a Friday news conference if the superpowers differ on how to handle 
Iraq, Gorbachev answered: "We all have to be very responsible so that a 
large-scale military conflict is not unleashed. This, I think, is our mutual 
concern. . . . If you think that this is disagreement in our policies, I, on 
the contrary, think this is cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
By speaking in Helsinki with one voice to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Bush 
and Gorbachev would vividly demonstrate the new relationship between their 
countries, as well as dramatically serve notice to Baghdad of its isolation in 
the world community.

EXERCISE IN POLLUTED AIR HARD ON HEART, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who exercise in highly polluted air may be risking heart attacks, 
according to the most extensive test of the effects of carbon monoxide on 
humans, published Saturday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Although the research concentrated on men and women with histories of heart 
disease, it found that carbon monoxide emissions from cars and industrial sites 
are a potential risk for anyone who exercises outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be prudent to avoid exercise in areas that are polluted because it is 
just not healthy. And it's possibly quite hazardous," study director David 
Sheps, of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, 41 men and women who had histories of heart problems were 
subjected to cardiac, lung and blood tests while at rest and while riding a 
stationary bicycle. The volunteers then sat, idle, for several minutes in rooms 
with 100 and 200 parts per million carbon monoxide, after which they exercised 
and were tested again. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers exposed to carbon monoxide before or during exercise were three 
times more likely to suffer abnormal heartbeats or other cardiac irregularities 
associated with heart attack. Dangerous irregularities arose even when they sat 
still, breathing the carbon monoxide-rich air. Exercising or simply breathing 
in a carbon monoxide-rich environment also increased the rate of ischemia 
(blocked blood vessels) in all volunteers.

Police pressed their search Saturday for a retired prison officer that they 
suspect may have killed former state Sen. Vander Beatty, apparently in a rage 
over losing a child support dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty, 49, was killed Thursday by a gunman who strode into his Brooklyn 
campaign office and shot him almost point-blank, then drove off in a car that 
was found stalled and abandoned three blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Tina Mohrmann said police want to question the car's owner, Arthur 
Flournoy, 51, of Brooklyn, a city Correction Department employee for 22 years 
until he retired as a captain in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Flournoy and Beatty had been friends for 30 years, since college. 
</P>
<P>
"We are leaving no stone unturned," Mohrmann said. She refused to comment on 
reports that the Brooklyn apartment of Flournoy's girlfriend has been searched. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Flournoy wanted to decrease his child support payments to his 
former wife, and hired attorney Harry Pollak for that purpose on the advice of 
Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
Pollak told police he appeared in state Supreme Court on Thursday morning with 
Flournoy to move for reducing aid to his two teen-age children. The judge 
denied the motion and an angry Flournoy assaulted Pollak in the elevator, then 
walked away, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty was shot about 45 minutes later, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Flournoy told authorities she had not heard from her ex-husband since 
he disappeared. Police were said to have searched Flournoy's home and that of a 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Police have yet to find the murder weapon, Mohrmann said. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed a strange person," Pollak reportedly said of Flournoy. "His attitude 
was not good. He punched me. Before yesterday's (Thursday's) thing, I told him 
I was going to withdraw from the case." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty was running for a political committee chairmanship and authorities said 
Flournoy appeared at his campaign headquarters several times. 
</P>
<P>
Once an outspoken advocate for the black community and a political powerbroker, 
Beatty left the Senate in 1982 for an unsuccessful congressional campaign that 
included a scam to create the appearance of voter registration fraud by Major 
R. Owens, his successful opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty was released from prison five years ago after serving a 31-month 
sentence on tax-evasion, racketeering and election-fraud charges.

CANADIAN TROOPS MOVE IN AFTER 2 MOHAWKS ARE HURT

Troops backed by armored vehicles and helicopters on Saturday swept into a 
Mohawk community at the hub of a 53-day protest. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Armand Roy, commander of the Canadian Forces 5th Brigade, said he decided 
to send in his troops after two Mohawk men were wounded in the factional 
fighting behind Indian barricades set up in a land dispute with government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to move my troops so as to guarantee the security of civilians and 
my soldiers," Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec provincial police identified the wounded Mohawks as Chief Francis Jacob 
and his son, Corey. The two were beaten with baseball bats by members of the 
Warrior's Society early Saturday, police said. Francis Jacob, who had two black 
eyes, was later released from hospital. His son's condition was not released. 
</P>
<P>
Police also said the Mohawk settlement's ambulance was damaged after it was 
fired upon. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fighting was unclear. But the militant Warrior's Society has 
been vying with elected native officials for authority within the Mohawk 
community. 
</P>
<P>
The military action came after efforts to reach a negotiated settlement in the 
53-day dispute failed. The Mohawks have been trying to block a golf course 
extension on land they claim is theirs, but they also have raised other 
grievances. 
</P>
<P>
One shot was fired into the air by a Mohawk after the troops moved in, the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported, but there were no reports of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
About seven armored personnel carriers were halted by a Mohawk warrior who 
parked his golf cart in front of a barricade. As the military vehicles stopped, 
a front-end loader with a dozen Mohawks in its bucket arrived and the Indians 
fanned out into the nearby forest. 
</P>
<P>
The troops moved into an area where the army had estimated that at least 50 
armed members of the Warrior's Society took up positions in a pine forest and 
behind barricades across a highway. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mohawks from the Kanewake reserve south of Montreal allowed troops 
to remove the main barricades they had set up on routes leading to the Mercier 
bridge. Quebec Transport Department officials said it would take several days 
before the bridge can be reopened to traffic.

A slab of the Berlin Wall tipped over and crushed an unidentified 14-year-old 
boy to death as he was trying to chip souvenir pieces from it, police said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The (concrete) segment came loose and fell over on the boy like a guillotine. 
He was killed instantly," a West Berlin police spokesman said of the accident 
Friday night.

Hundreds of people have been hammering at the wall for months to take chunks of 
it home as souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first known death around the Wall since East Germany's democratic 
revolution in late 1989.

The CDC shipped more than 100 monkeys from the Lawrenceville, Ga., facility on

monkeys used for research still will be housed at the compound northeast of

Large-scale bird die-offs are so rare in Alaska that state and federal

ANTI-ABORTION ADVOCATES TRY PRESSURING CALIFORNIA JUDGES WITH PROTESTS; 
</P>
<P>
TACTICS: ORGANIZERS, LINKED WITH OPERATION RESCUE, SAY JURISTS HAVE TREATED 
THEM HARSHLY. SOME JUDGES RESPOND THAT ACTIONS ARE 'ILL-ADVISED' AND 
'INAPPROPRIATE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A national anti-abortion group affiliated with Operation Rescue has targeted 17 
Southern California judges and nine others statewide for picketing, rallies, 
protest letters and telephone calls in what they say is the first organized 
effort to pressure jurists who have ruled against abortion protesters. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington, D.C.-based group, known as the Christian Defense Coalition, has 
distributed more than 500 leaflets containing the judges' office telephone 
numbers and addresses, names of those sentenced in abortion protests, and 
sentencing summaries. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers, who include Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, said they have 
targeted California judges first because they believe anti-abortion protesters 
in the state -- particularly those in Los Angeles and San Diego counties -- 
have been unfairly punished. 
</P>
<P>
Terry said Southern California judges have been especially harsh on members of 
Operation Rescue and other Christian organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Diego, there's a general tone of harassment; in Los Angeles, the judges 
are all part of some conspiracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, hundreds of people have been arrested in anti-abortion 
protests throughout Southern California. Almost all cases have been resolved, 
with most of those found guilty serving either minimal jail sentences, agreeing 
to probation or accepting community service assignments with anti-abortion 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
All of the targeted judges have sentenced abortion protesters to jail time. In 
many cases, the judges offered probation, but protesters refused because they 
would have had to refrain from future demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
One of the coalition's primary targets is El Cajon Municipal Judge Larrie 
Brainard, who sentenced anti-abortion attorney Cyrus Zal of Folsom to 290 days 
in jail on contempt of court charges last February. Zal began serving his 
sentence two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Brainard was the target of repeated protests before the sentencing. His former 
home was picketed in May and his office has been swamped with hundreds of 
protest letters and telephone calls on Zal's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Brainard expressed displeasure at the possibility that he may have to face a 
new stream of attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an ill-advised tactic," he said. "These people don't accept the 
fact that I'm a minor magistrate expected to uphold the law. Abortion is legal 
and that is the fact." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the Los Angeles-area judges on the list said they have noticed an 
increase in protest telephone calls and letters, and some included threats to 
report them to the state Commission on Judicial Performance. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a novelty to me," said Los Angeles Municipal Judge David S. Milton, 
who is included on the list. "To go so far as to threaten a complaint with the 
Judicial Performance Commission is unfair." 
</P>
<P>
It is highly unusual for a political group to try to intimidate a judge once a 
decision is made, according to Warren Conklin, a San Luis Obispo Superior Court 
judge and president of the California Judges Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin, who is not among those targeted, said he could not recall a similar 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
"The position of the judiciary is that it's absolutely inappropriate to target 
a judge for a decision he or she may have made and subject that judge to 
harassment," Conklin said. "A judicial decision is not part of a public give 
and take." 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Duffy, who heads the coalition's office, said anti-abortion 
organizations in California developed the list of judges for a radio broadcast 
on Christian stations Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong program, called "With Justice for All," featured members of 
various Christian groups and focused on what they believed was unfair treatment 
of anti-abortion advocates by California judges. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said the show, broadcast on 50 to 60 stations throughout the state, 
encouraged callers to phone an 800 number and request the list of judges who 
they said displayed "outrageous and tyrannical behavior" in dealing with 
abortion protesters. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition distributed about 500 copies of the California judge's list, he 
said. Duffy said that although California judges were the first to be targeted, 
such mailings will be made in other parts of the country where the coalition 
spots problems. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Ann Winebrenner, who is on the list, said she 
understands the protesters' position. 
</P>
<P>
"They sincerely believe that judges are legislating from the bench," she said. 
"They feel judges are giving their own opinions and not granting fair trials." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Winebrenner and Brainard, targeted San Diego County area judges are El 
Cajon Municipal Judges Richard Bein, Eddie Sturgeon, Elizabeth Riggs and Victor 
Bianchini and San Diego Municipal Judges John Thompson and Michael Orfield. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Municipal judges included on the list, in addition to 
Milton, are J. Stephen Czuleger, Patty Jo McKay, Richard A. Paez, Victoria M. 
Chavez, Ernest A. Aubry, John W. Ouderkirk, Enrique Romero and Van Nuys 
Municipal Judge Lloyd Nash. 
</P>
<P>
The nine Northern California judges listed are: Thomas Kelly and R. McAdams of 
the Santa Cruz Municipal Court, Santa Clara Municipal Judge Leon Fox, Judge 
John DeGroot of the Madera County District Court, Fred Dupras of the 
Reedly-Dunlap District Court, Stephen Graham of the Marin County Municipal 
Court, Lynee O'Malley-Taylor of the Marin County Municipal Court, Merle Eaton 
of the Walnut Creek Municipal Court, and Gregory Caskey of the Shasta County 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue's Terry formed the coalition in June with two Florida 
ministers -- Rev. George Grant of the Coral Ridge Ministries in Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla. and Rev. Patrick Mahoney of the Center for Christian Activism in Boca 
Raton, Fla. -- to fight public officials, including judges, police officers, 
prosecutors and politicians who they believe have mistreated them. 
</P>
<P>
The group has yet to file its incorporation papers, Terry said, or to fully 
disclose its membership or board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"The judges in San Diego and Southern California right now are making political 
prisoners of our people," he said. "We are preparing a network of churches and 
Christian organizations for a quick strike because these judges are still 
accountable to the voting electorate and to God."

NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
* Taking the Fifth: Eric Show, Mike Dunne and Calvin Schiraldi have all tried 
to become the fifth starter in the San Diego Padres' rotation with a startling 
lack of success. They have started 24 games, pitched into the seventh inning 
only three times and won just two games in that role. A fifth starter, a 
regular shortstop and a third baseman top the Padres' winter shopping list, but 
it's not clear who will be doing the shopping. New owner Tom Werner has 
re-hired Greg Riddoch as manager but is yet to make a definitive call on 
General Manager Jack McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
* Nixon Library: With Otis Nixon having stolen 41 bases in only 165 at-bats, 
Richard Griffin, the Montreal Expos' publicity director, went to the books and 
discovered that Miguel Dilone of the 1978 Oakland Athletics had the fewest 
at-bats among players who have stolen 50 bases in a season. Dilone had 258. 
</P>
<P>
* Add Steals: Eric Yelding, through Thursday, had stolen 50 bases, had been 
caught stealing 21 times and has a chance to break Houston's club records in 
both categories. Gerald Young set them in 1988 when he stole 65 bases and was 
caught 27 times. 
</P>
<P>
* Baines a Pain: One other aspect of the Oakland Athletics' acquisition of 
Harold Baines concerns preparations for a likely meeting with the Boston Red 
Sox in the American League playoffs. Baines has a .333 average against Roger 
Clemens and a .367 average against Mike Boddicker, Boston's top two starters. 
</P>
<P>
* Mismatch: Once a highly regarded prospect with the New York Yankees, Brad 
Arnsberg has rebounded from Tommy John-type elbow surgery in 1988 and revived 
his career in the Texas Rangers' bullpen with a 5-1 record and five saves. But 
he shouldn't pitch against the Angels. In four appearances spanning 4 2/3 
innings, he has allowed nine hits, six earned runs and three homers, among them 
shots by Devon White and Lance Parrish during the Angels' three-game sweep last 
week. In 46 1/3 innings against the rest of the league, Arnsberg has allowed 
only 33 hits and three earned runs. ROSS NEWHAN

FLACH TAKES A WALK, SHOWN THE GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Flach, who walked off the court at the U.S. Open Saturday in the third set 
of his first-round mixed doubles match with partner Patty Fendick, was fined 
$3,200, defaulted from the competition and also defaulted from the men's 
doubles with partner Robert Seguso. 
</P>
<P>
Flach left the court with his team trailing Elise Burgin and Laurie Warder, 
5-2. Apparently upset over a series of line calls, Flach twice slammed tennis 
balls off the court, then walkedaway. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Slam supervisor Ken Farrar fined Flach $350 for each instance of ball 
abuse, $1,500 for failing to complete the match and $1,000 for defaulting the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Farrar also automatically defaulted Flach and Seguso from the men's doubles, 
which they won in 1985.

FOOTBALL: GRADUATION STRIPS LEAGUE OF SOME OF ITS MOST IMPRESSIVE FIREPOWER OF 
A YEAR AGO.

<P>
Many of the Channel League's fleet tailbacks and bruising fullbacks have 
graduated, and league coaches are on the defensive this fall. 
</P>
<P>
A talented group of runners provided weekly offensive showdowns last season, 
including a 107-point barrage involving Santa Barbara and Oxnard highs. But now 
coaches are expecting the league to return to its form of 1987, when strong 
defenses dominated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be the one of the biggest years for defenses," said Buena Coach 
Rick Scott, whose team had the league's second-best defense last season. 
</P>
<P>
"But maybe we will all be better defensive teams because all those running 
backs have graduated," he added, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
The corps that caused most of the trouble last year included Ventura's Danny 
Taylor (1,554 yards), Oxnard's Bryant Taylor (1,436), Dos Pueblos' Marcus 
Preciado (1,100), Oxnard's Johnel Turner (748), Buena's Tony Williams (725), 
and Rio Mesa's Scott O'Neill (700). 
</P>
<P>
"There were some exceptional offensive players last season," Dos Pueblos Coach 
Jeff Hesselmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rio Mesa Coach John Reardon: "Last year, everybody had a running back. 
This year it's questionable whether the skill players are there." 
</P>
<P>
Reardon and league coaches are quick to credit running backs Mike Castelo of 
San Marcos and Kenyon Lewis of Oxnard, and receivers Simon Banks of Santa 
Barbara and Jamie Liddel of Rio Mesa. But all are even quicker to point out 
that there are not as many quality players as there were in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the league will be epitomized by physical defenses and fairly 
conservative offenses, like 1987," Hueneme Coach George Machado said. "Heck, if 
you put us all in a room and asked us to scribble offensive plays on the 
blackboard, we'd all be asleep in five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Castelo, a 5-foot-10, 175-pound senior, likely will provide plenty of 
excitement. He rushed for 1,700 yards and scored 22 touchdowns behind a small 
San Marcos line last year. Also, San Marcos quarterback David Lopez, a 
second-team all-league pick a year ago, is considered the league's best. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a 6-2, 190-pound tailback who was mentioned in Super Prep magazine as a 
player to watch, will have plenty of opportunity to showcase his talents. "Our 
offense will be pitch-it-to-Lewis," Oxnard Coach Jack Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, a 5-10, 170-pound senior, might be the league's finest offensive talent. 
Banks caught 41 passes for 991 yards last year and Super Prep considers him the 
seventh-best prospect in the Far West. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the league's finest players are linemen and defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Among the skilled linemen are Ventura seniors Samsun Okinaga (6-0, 220) and 
Brandon Evans (6-5, 255), part of the largest offensive line in Ventura 
history. Okinaga was a second-team, all-league player last season and is one 
reason the Cougars are expected to contend with two-time champion Santa Barbara 
for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara is led by Banks, tackle Dan Molina (6-4, 280), and tight end 
Derek Elbert (6-6, 220). 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, the talent is just as strong with Rio Mesa linebacker Sam Garcia 
(6-1, 225), Dos Pueblos safety Cy Brunner (5-8, 160) and San Marcos lineman 
Erubey Nava (5-9, 200). 
</P>
<P>
Last year's top two teams -- Santa Barbara and Buena -- also had the league's 
top two defenses. 
</P>
<P>
"This year the best defensive teams will be up there at the top," Machado said. 
"I think you can probably expect a lot of 14-13 games and some decided on 
last-second field goals."

TAKING STOCK OF WALL STREET; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETS: THE CRISIS-INSPIRED STOCK PLUNGE MATTERS, BUT STOCKS ARE AN UNRELIABLE 
ECONOMIC BAROMETER. WHEN THEY CRASHED IN OCTOBER, 1987, NOT MUCH HAPPENED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fallout from the Persian Gulf crisis has drifted thousands of miles to Wall 
Street, where the summer's rally has fizzled like a Roman candle. 
</P>
<P>
As energy prices have soared, stock prices have plunged, capturing headlines, 
spooking investors and fanning fears of recession. Overall, the market has lost 
more than $324 billion in value since Iraqi troops rolled into Kuwait, 
according to Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the clamor, does the general public have reason to care? 
</P>
<P>
"The stock market is just not that important -- particularly in its day-to-day 
and week-to-week changes," argues David I. Levine, a professor of economics at 
UC Berkeley's Walter A. Haas School of Business. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the attention lavished on Wall Street, its significance in the grand 
economic scheme remains unclear. Four out of five U.S. households own no stock 
or mutual funds, excluding pension plans, according to studies at the 
University of Michigan. Widespread forecasts that the crash of October, 1987, 
would trigger an economic slump proved wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it would be a mistake to dismiss today's financial turmoil as unrelated to 
the rest of the nation, some analysts say. Unlike the 1987 crash, it reflects 
genuine economic problems that the public understands well: the damage that 
higher energy costs can wreak in the form of inflation and higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not as wealthy as we were, there's no question about that," said Frank 
C. Wykoff, an economics professor at Pomona College in Claremont. "(Iraqi 
President) Saddam Hussein has done that to us, whether he meant to or not." 
</P>
<P>
Economists pay attention to the stock market for a few reasons. Its changes 
often mirror the public mood, as jittery stock movements seem to be doing right 
now. A prolonged rise or fall may point the way to the future course of the 
U.S. economy. Moreover, the skittish market has important, albeit indirect, 
effects on the more plodding economy of industrial America. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an economy of work and production, and there is an economy of 
financial transactions," observed Robert L. Heilbroner, an economist at the New 
School of Social Research in New York. "They are certainly bound together, but 
they are certainly loosely bound together." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the market's connection to things outside the financial world is tricky 
to measure. Its record as economic seer, for instance, is decidedly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials consider the stock market important enough to include in 
their index of leading economic indicators, along with such weather vanes as 
building permits and orders for business equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Yet after the October, 1987, market debacle, the U.S. economy continued to 
grow, with the help of lower interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve 
Board. Similarly, a 190-point dive by the Dow Jones industrial index in 
October, 1989, amounted to a blip on an analyst's computer screen, an economic 
non-event. 
</P>
<P>
"You pick any recession you want and you'd find the stock market started to 
decline before it," said Edward E. Yardeni, director of economics at 
Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. "But the stock market has also 
predicted a few we haven't had." 
</P>
<P>
The market also is an unreliable barometer of spending in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Economists teach that declines in wealth translate to declines in spending, 
perhaps a cutback of a few cents for each $1 lost. Yet the link is not easy to 
establish after short-term market swings -- even huge ones. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the 1987 slide. Between August and late October, more than $1 trillion 
in "paper" wealth was erased, according to calculations by Wilshire Associates. 
But to pinpoint a spending decline that is caused by short-term market swings 
is like looking for "a needle in a haystack," Wykoff said. 
</P>
<P>
A whole range of factors, including real estate values and job skills -- what 
economists call human capital -- can affect a person's sense of affluence and 
willingness to spend. A momentary jump in the stock market doesn't set off a 
stampede of luxury purchases, and a temporary fall doesn't create widespread 
panic. 
</P>
<P>
For people to view stock market declines as more than ephemeral shifts on 
paper, "I think people have to really begin to believe that it's a permanent 
downward adjustment," said Dennis E. Logue, a financial economist at the Amos 
Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
"If the stock market blips up or blips down around some normal, long-run rate 
of return, I'm not sure those blips matter very much." 
</P>
<P>
What may matter more is the way that weakness in the market can dampen the 
plans of business executives to spend and invest. When values are high, issuing 
new stock can be a painless way for companies to raise investment money. When 
values are low, by contrast, companies are forced to issue a larger number of 
shares to raise the desired amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
But executives may not want to issue too many shares, in part because that 
dilutes each shareholder's ownership stake in the company, said Richard J. 
Sweeney, a professor of finance at Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, rank-and-file workers may suffer because their wage prospects 
ultimately depend on investments that will boost their productivity. "If I'm a 
worker in that company, I'm not going to be getting more wages for being more 
productive," said Sweeney. "That's not attractive." 
</P>
<P>
The market also can affect some 43 million Americans who may own stock through 
their private pension plans. Barring a financial cataclysm, however, the 
effects are limited. 
</P>
<P>
Most pensioners rely on a type of plan that provides a guaranteed benefit that 
is not linked to market swings. Despite the October, 1987, crash, most pension 
plans finished the year with more assets than they had at the beginning, 
according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for retirees: Even most of those who took a hit in late 1987 
finished the year better off than they were before the vast run-up earlier in 
the year, EBRI found. 
</P>
<P>
For workers and pensioners, a potential downside of prolonged weakness in the 
stock market is that that their employer might be less likely to institute new, 
improved benefits, said Joseph S. Piacentini, a research associate at the 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
"When the market is strong, it makes it cheaper to maintain a generous pension 
plan," Piacentini said. "In the long run, with weaker markets you'd expect some 
downward pressure on benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the least tangible way the stock market affects the overall economy is 
the role it plays in shaping Americans' sense of financial security. The public 
mood is important: Consumer spending amounts to two-thirds of all spending in 
the economy and is tracked closely by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasts that the 1987 crash would cause a recession assumed that 
nerve-wracked consumers would hold off on major purchases, dragging down the 
economy. In fact, auto sales fell after Black Monday, and there were other 
warning signs of a broad slowdown. But when the crash was not followed by 
ominous developments, such as a rise in unemployment, business picked up and 
the economy continued to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Today's worries are different, economists say, because they arise from 
potentially serious economic problems that have nothing to do with the 
spectacle on Wall Street. The current concerns also hit home in a way that the 
1987 crash did not, because many adults retain distasteful memories of past oil 
shocks. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, "People said this is just some funny gyration in the stock market, and 
it doesn't affect me," observed F. Thomas Juster, a professor of economics at 
the University of Michigan. "But everybody understands the effect of oil prices 
on inflation. Now people say this is a real event." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, overall consumer confidence in August plunged to its lowest level 
in more than seven years, according to a survey by the Conference Board in New 
York. Expectations about job availability and business conditions are the 
gloomiest they have been in years. 
</P>
<P>
But it would be wrong to cite the mercurial stock market as the main cause of 
such doubts, said Jason D. Bram, an economist with the business research 
organization. Job security, inflation and, to a lesser extent, interest rates 
and real estate values, all influence the public's sense of well-being more 
than the stock market does, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus some experts would rank the latest sparks in the financial world way down 
the list of what's really important to America's long-term prosperity. "If 
you're worried about the future, you should be worried about infrastructure and 
schools -- not the stock market and Iraq," counsels Berkeley's Levine. 
</P>
<P>
THE VOLATILE STOCK MARKET 
</P>
<P>
The crash of Black Monday, 1987, was part of a much larger slide that began in 
late August and continued until late October. After a huge rally earlier in the 
year, the market peaked on Aug. 25. The crash took place on Oct. 19, but the 
market didn't hit bottom until Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
This summer's rally came to an abrupt finale in mid-July, two weeks before the 
Persian Gulf crisis. The recent peak was on July 16. But the slide didn't 
accelerate until Iraq invaded Kuwait at the beginning of August. Stocks hit 
their recent bottom on Aug. 23 and have recovered only partially.

The city of Duarte was built on G.I. dreams. Dreams like Monty and Dorothy 
Montgomery's. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of World War II, J. A. (Monty) Montgomery had just finished a South 
Pacific sojourn on a Navy destroyer; Dorothy was a WAVE stationed at Treasure 
Island naval base in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
They met, fell in love, got married, mustered out of the service and then, like 
a lot of Northerners -- she was from chilly Michigan, he was from chillier 
North Dakota -- they joined the migration to sunny Southern California and 
started looking for a place to live and raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, like thousands of other former servicemen and their families who 
had similar hopes and dreams, they found themselves in the middle of the worst 
housing shortage in Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
"God, it was awful," Monty Montgomery, 67, a retired construction contractor 
and former Duarte city councilman, says. "There was nothing -- nothing! -- 
available anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But if housing was scarce, orange and avocado groves were plentiful. And in the 
face of the incredible demand for new homes, developers cut down the groves, 
poured thousands upon thousands of concrete slabs and created vast tracts of 
single-story, ranch-style houses with big back yards -- "G.I. houses," they 
called them then. 
</P>
<P>
After living with his parents in Pasadena for awhile, and then in a too-small 
house in what is now Monrovia, the Montgomerys visited one such tract in an 
unincorporated area at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, due east of 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"A real estate agent took us around to look at lots of houses, including these, 
which were still being built," says Dorothy Montgomery, 64, sitting in the 
kitchen of her four-bedroom, two-bath home on a cul-de-sac at the end of Cinco 
Robles Drive. (Cul-de-sacs were a startlingly innovative concept back then.) 
</P>
<P>
"Everything clicked; we were the first family to move into this tract. It was 
like being out in the country." 
</P>
<P>
The Montgomerys paid $12,800 for their home, which seemed like a lot of money 
at the time. Monty Montgomery says he was offered $190,000 for the house not 
long ago. 
</P>
<P>
According to real estate agents in the Duarte area, that puts the Montgomery 
home in the medium price range; prices in Duarte range from $130,000 at the 
extreme low end to almost half a million dollars for some homes in the newer, 
hillside areas. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, the 6,000 or so residents of the area became concerned about 
encroaching gravel quarry operations, so they incorporated a 6.8-square-mile 
area and became the city of Duarte, named after Andres Duarte, a 19th-Century 
Spanish soldier who owned Rancho Duarte until the Americans took over from 
Mexico and he got behind on his tax payments. 
</P>
<P>
The new city was a classic Los Angeles "bedroom community." There really wasn't 
a downtown to speak of, police and fire protection were provided by the county 
on a contract basis and except for the City of Hope Hospital (now Medical 
Center), which was founded in 1913 as a tuberculosis sanitarium, there wasn't 
much in the way of large business or industry in the city either. It was a 
place where people lived and raised families. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very family-oriented community back then," says Monty Montgomery, the 
kind of community where PTA meetings were always packed. (Duarte had formed its 
own school district in 1957.) Almost every family had two or three children; 
the Montgomerys had six. 
</P>
<P>
That sense of community began to change in the late 1960s, the Montgomerys say, 
when the Foothill (210) Freeway was built, dividing the city into north and 
south. Increased commercial development along Huntington Drive, which runs 
north of and parallel to the freeway, also served to separate the two sections 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, homes south of Huntington Drive are older and less 
expensive than the ones to the north, many of which were built in the 1970s 
rather than in the post-World War II boom. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in Baja Duarte," Dorothy Montgomery says, laughing. "A lot of new people 
(in Duarte) see it as a lower economic area." 
</P>
<P>
Although Monty Montgomery would like to move -- now that their children have 
grown, he says, "the house is just too big" -- both Montgomerys think that 
Duarte, whether baja or alta, is still a good place to live. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just a good basic attitude here," Monty says. "I still enjoy this 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Carey, a retired auto upholsterer and a 40-year resident of Duarte, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just been a very pleasant place to live," says Carey, 67, who with his 
wife, Nita, paid $8,600 for their three-bedroom home on Chesson Street in 1949, 
back when "there was nothing but orange groves out here." He values it now in 
the just-under-$200,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
Carey is concerned that "there just isn't as much a sense of community as there 
used to be" -- an old-timer's lament that probably can be heard in any city or 
town in America -- and he misses the "out in the country" feeling that Duarte 
had before it was surrounded by suburban sprawl, and saw its own population 
grow from 6,000 to more than 21,000. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he rates Duarte highly in "quality of life" terms -- and adds that even 
the famous San Gabriel smog isn't really as bad as some people may think. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a kind of a pocket here in Duarte," Carey says. "We have smog some 
days, but other times we don't." 
</P>
<P>
The Careys plan to spend the rest of their lives in Duarte -- "If I was going 
to move I would have done it years ago," Carey says -- but if they did decide 
to leave Duarte, who would take their place? 
</P>
<P>
Most likely it would be people who, like the ex-G.I.s, are looking for 
relatively affordable housing in a suburban atmosphere. They may be raising a 
family -- Duarte now averages three persons per household, the highest average 
since the end of the postwar baby boom -- or they may be people who are simply 
looking for more bang for their home buying buck. 
</P>
<P>
They may also be Latino; Duarte, like many L.A. suburbs, was once almost 
exclusively Anglo, but now is 30% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Margie Garcia, an executive secretary who works in Eagle Rock, and her husband, 
Orlando, lived in Northeast Los Angeles for 30 years, until her mother moved to 
Duarte. They were quickly hooked on the community. 
</P>
<P>
"We got to know the area, because of my mother, and we liked it a lot," Margie 
Garcia, 51, says. "And the housing prices were pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
So about a year ago, the Garcias bought a single-story, three bedroom home on a 
quiet residential street called Greenbank Avenue. They paid $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I just love it up here," Garcia says. "We have a big back yard, a beautiful 
oak kitchen -- I fell in love with that kitchen -- nice neighbors. It's a safe 
place to live. And I enjoy being able to see the mountains. The mountains are 
just beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Since she moved there, Garcia says, two of her grown children have also moved 
to apartments in Duarte, and they want to buy homes there as well. 
</P>
<P>
According to Phil Reyes of Century 21 Always, who has lived in Duarte for 12 
years, this may be a good time for them to start looking. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of good values out here," Reyes says. "There's been a real 
settling of prices, and there's tons of inventory." 
</P>
<P>
Good housing values were what prompted Ron Moore, 46, a commercial real estate 
broker, to buy a home in Duarte. He and his wife, Dianne, and their two young 
children had formerly rented a home in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did we move to Duarte? Because I wasn't happy with what a quarter million 
dollars could buy in Pasadena," Moore says. "So we decided to look eastward." 
</P>
<P>
The Moores recently paid about $250,000 for a 2,000-square-foot, decade-old 
four-bedroom house on Shadylawn Drive -- a misnomer, since as Moore points out, 
there aren't any large shade trees on it. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the lack of foliage, Moore says he is "very pleased and impressed" 
with the city so far, "especially with all the community services geared toward 
children The parks are excellent." 
</P>
<P>
Moore isn't certain how long he and his family will stay in Duarte. A Northern 
California native, Moore says he's getting increasingly fed up with life in 
Southern California in general -- smog, traffic, crime, etc., the usual 
Northern Californian's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
For Moore, then, and perhaps for some other newcomers, Duarte may not be the 
settle-in-for-life suburban dreamland that it was for many of the ex-G.I.s of 
40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But as Moore says, "For the moment, at least, Duarte's a very nice place to 
live."

CENTURY 21 PULLS OUT OF MORTGAGE LENDING;

<P>
FINANCING: REAL ESTATE GIANT LEARNS THAT SELLING AND LENDING FOR 'ONE-STOP' 
SERVICE DO NOT NECESSARILY MIX.

In what some experts say is another sign that mortgage lending and real estate 
sales just don't mix, sales giant Century 21 Real Estate Corp. has quietly 
decided to fold its mortgage operations. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's biggest real estate network started the Century 21 Mortgage Corp. 
in the mid-1980s, hoping to bolster profits by making loans to consumers who 
purchased homes through the company's 600,000-plus real estate agents. 
</P>
<P>
It was, company officials said at the time, the "ultimate in one-stop shopping" 
-- you would buy a house from a C-21 agent and also get a loan from its 
mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
Century 21's executives also hoped that you would purchase your insurance and 
other financial products from its parent company, Metropolitan Life Insurance 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
But Century 21 now knows what some other big companies with similar plans have 
found out before: A good real estate agent doesn't always make a good loan 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still some merit to the one-stop concept, but we've decided to 
concentrate on our core business," said Bob Hutchinson, Century 21's executive 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Century 21 Mortgage quit accepting loan applications a few months ago, 
Hutchinson said. Applications that were taken before the cutoff will be 
processed and the money will be loaned to avoid disrupting transactions, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Century 21 isn't the first company to find out that running a good real estate 
company isn't the same as operating a successful lending organization -- and 
vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-'80s, financial services giant Guild Mortgage bought the 400-outlet 
Red Carpet Real Estate Services in an effort to bolster its loan production. 
</P>
<P>
But just a few years later, Guild admitted that the hoped-for "synergy" between 
its lending and sales operations never materialized and sold Red Carpet to 
another company. 
</P>
<P>
Even retailing giant Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. hasn't had too much success in 
executing the one-stop shopping concept. It has bought a variety of finance- 
and real estate-related companies, but not many buyers who use the Sears-owned 
Coldwell Banker brokerage firm get their loans from its Sears Mortgage Corp., 
buy insurance from its Allstate subsidiary or purchase stock through its Dean 
Witter Reynolds offices. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, the failure of companies such as Century 21 and Guild Mortgage 
to pull off a successful marriage of lending and sales has been caused by the 
growing savvy of today's borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are a lot more educated than they used to be," said Barbara Pivnicka 
of the Roulac Group, the real estate consulting division of accounting giant 
Deloitte &amp; Touche. 
</P>
<P>
"If a realtor can offer a buyer the best rate on the best terms, than the buyer 
will take the loan. But if that buyer can get a better rate or better terms 
somewhere else, he throws that one-stop shopping concept out the window." 
</P>
<P>
It's not uncommon for a realtor to suggest that a buyer visit a particular 
lender when the buyer is looking for a loan. But if the lender then pays the 
realtor for sending your business his way, is it an illegal kickback or merely 
a "referral fee"? 
</P>
<P>
The question has had realtors and many lenders squabbling with each other for 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
But the debate recently heated up when Ronnie Wynn -- president of the powerful 
Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America -- told a congressional panel that the fees 
are encouraging realtors to "steer" borrowers to lenders who offer the biggest 
payoffs even if the borrower could save money by going someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
"Real estate brokers and agents are in a unique position, with considerable 
influence over the home buyer's decision," Wynn told the House Subcommittee on 
Housing and Community Development. 
</P>
<P>
"Their recommendations should be based on the best combination of interest 
rate, terms and services. . . . Allowing referral fees to be paid increases the 
possibility that referrals will be made based on who pays the highest fee to 
the broker or agent." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 2,600 financial institutions that belong to Wynn's group do not 
offer referral fees to realtors, but members of competing trade groups do. Both 
Congress and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development are 
considering tightening regulations that govern referrals. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors say they don't steer business to any lender just to pick up an extra 
few hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"But if the realtor discloses that he's collecting a fee and provides the 
seller with a legitimate service, he's entitled to collect a fee if one is 
offered," said Leslie Appleton-Young, an official with the California Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wynn's group and realtor officials will air their views in front of a 
Senate panel later this month. The debate could be decided within a few months 
if HUD decides to get involved, or it could take more than a year if 
legislative action is taken. 
</P>
<P>
All the trouble in the Persian Gulf might be pushing up the price you pay for 
gas, but it might also soon push down the rate you pay on your mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Assn. of Realtors, says the 
huge cost of sending U.S. troops to the gulf and the recent jump in oil prices 
should be enough "to push the nation's teetering economy over the edge and into 
a recession" by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Tuccillo predicts, mortgage rates could drop back to the single 
digits in the next few months and stay in the 9%-range until the economy 
recovers in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Tuccillo admits that single-digit rates won't reignite the nation's housing 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"Nervous consumers just don't buy houses when there's a recession," he said. 
"But if you already own a house and your job is secure, a recession can be a 
great time to refinance your loan."

<TEXT>
<P>
Six months ago, streams of yellow police tape were strung along 15 miles of 
oil-soaked beaches like a grim warning, keeping people away from Orange 
County's most notorious crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
All over this ocean-side city, people talked -- in coffee shops, in press 
conferences, in City Hall chambers -- about the crime against nature, when 
crude oil gushed from a ruptured tanker onto the beaches on Feb. 7. And they 
vowed to never let it happen again.

The day after the spill, Janice Belk, a 13-year resident of Huntington Harbour, 
stood next to the Huntington Pier and watched, startled and helpless, as a 
tear-shaped, ink-colored slick hovered near the coast. "Oh, goodness," she said 
that day. "We won't be seeing the surfers. We'll be seeing dead fish and dead 
birds." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Belk looks back on a summer full of nature's restoration. She pedals her 
bicycle along the shore, relishing all the signs of normalcy. 
</P>
<P>
"The surfers are back," she said. "I see hundreds of them every day. It's also 
good to see the beautiful birds flying in again." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly seven months after 397,000 gallons of crude spilled from the American 
Trader's torn hull, the beaches are clean again, tourists are back, grunion are 
spawning, birds have nested, seaside businesses are booming and city budgets 
have almost recovered. 
</P>
<P>
And, about once a week, a giant oil tanker pulls quietly to the terminal off 
Huntington Beach, unloading millions of gallons of valuable cargo without 
incident. More tankers than ever use the mooring where the American Trader hit 
bottom on its own anchor, but they are now restricted to smaller sizes. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento and Washington, there has been political fallout from the recent 
spate of oil-tanker accidents on the nation's shorelines. Congress and the 
California Legislature have just adopted new laws that address tanker safety 
and create multimillion-dollar trust funds financed by the oil industry for 
handling future spills. 
</P>
<P>
But the final, unresolved chapter of the Huntington Beach spill -- determining 
how badly nature actually suffered and who will pay fines and damages and how 
much -- hasn't been written. The drama is being played out far from the beach 
-- in lawyers' offices from Los Angeles to New York. 
</P>
<P>
Although the slick is gone, an undercurrent of disillusionment lingers in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Some resentment toward the oil industry, and fears about long-term ecological 
damage remain. Environmental issues are in vogue now in a city that never had 
the ecological fervor of nearby Newport Beach or Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Belk said she looks at her favorite beaches in a new way -- as something 
precious and vulnerable to mankind's mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I always considered myself interested in the environment, but now I'm very 
concerned," she said. "Anybody who lives in this area would have to be 
concerned now." 
</P>
<P>
Too little time has passed, however, to judge whether all this talk will be 
transformed into permanent changes in how people treat their natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gorman, a firefighter and ecologist who quietly worked for years to save a 
little piece of Orange County's coast, knows this better than most. 
</P>
<P>
He and seven other Huntington Beach residents turned a 25-acre muddy patch off 
Pacific Coast Highway into a bird and fish sanctuary after several years of 
work. When the oil spewed out of the tanker, the wetlands had been resurrected 
for less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
A brokenhearted Gorman and others struggled day and night to save the marsh. It 
survived, but just barely; the brown tide slurped ashore, minutes after they 
had finished building their dirt dams. Small oily spots soiled the wetlands, 
but Gorman said the damage seems minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman now believes that the spill left the public with a greater sensitivity 
about the vulnerability of natural surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
That new awareness, he said, is "the single greatest" legacy left by the spill. 
</P>
<P>
"The environmental movement has been heightened by the spill, but measuring 
that is difficult -- it's difficult to quantify," Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
The first real test will come on Nov. 6, when three slow-growth advocates vie 
in the election against pro-development candidates for City Council seats. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the city now realize that steps must be taken to protect our 
beaches, including steps to prevent development," said Bob Biddle, president of 
Huntington Beach Tomorrow, a slow-growth organization. "This oil spill made 
people aware how fragile the whole area is. Until this happened, we've always 
taken our beaches for granted. We never thought something like this would 
happen to us." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest fallout is that Huntington Beach is no longer willing to 
look the other way when it comes to the oil industry that once was the 
community's dominant economic force. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is trying to persuade the State Lands Commission, which holds 
the deed, to cancel the lease at the Golden West Refining Co.'s tanker 
terminal, the only one off Orange County. The American Trader tore its hull on 
its anchor at the terminal 1.3 miles offshore as it approached to unload 
millions of gallons of British Petroleum oil into a pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
Calling its shoreline "the most visited recreational public beaches on the West 
Coast," the City Council wrote the state commission that "it would be doing a 
great disservice to the public" to let the terminal remain open, even though 
the lease doesn't expire for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel from a safety standpoint and from an environmental standpoint 
that our city -- in fact the whole Orange County coast -- would be better off 
if this mooring lease were ended," said Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays. 
</P>
<P>
If its terminal is shut down, said Roger Kemple, senior vice president of 
Golden West Refining, his company will have to find another way to deliver the 
crude oil to its refinery in Santa Fe Springs. A pipeline now links the 
Huntington Beach mooring to the refinery, so it would have to build another one 
elsewhere, or share another company's berth. 
</P>
<P>
"Any other options (for delivering oil) we look at cost more," Kemple said, 
"but they don't make the operation any safer." 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials concluded that the accident occurred at the mooring 
because of a freakish combination of conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Swells of 4 to 6 feet, a low tide, the tanker's pitching and gradual drifting 
of sand underneath the mooring all combined at 4:20 p.m. on Feb. 7 to cause the 
American Trader to bounce on the bottom and pierce its own hull. Tankers with 
the same draft -- the part of the ship that is under water -- had used the 
terminal often, but none had suffered the same fate. 
</P>
<P>
Before the spill, the ocean floor at that spot had not been officially surveyed 
for years. The area had experienced several major storms since then, but from 
the charts available, crews were unaware that shifting sand underneath had made 
the mooring several feet shallower than charts indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Now, under new Coast Guard rules, Golden West Refining must survey depths 
annually, and ship crews must use sounding devices and limit the sea conditions 
in which they approach. 
</P>
<P>
Tankers at the mooring also must carry smaller loads to maintain a 6-foot 
clearance between their anchors and the ocean floor. As a result, Golden West 
will slightly increase tanker traffic at the mooring. Ten oil tankers have 
unloaded there since traffic resumed four months ago, according to Coast Guard 
records. Before the spill, an average of 30 used it yearly. 
</P>
<P>
The new restrictions "have changed how they operate. They're more cautious 
now," said Cmdr. Gary Gregory, chief of port operations for the Coast Guard's 
Long Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, possibly because of the heightened concern for safety, at least three 
tankers approaching the mooring since April have turned around and awaited 
safer seas, Gregory said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a freak accident, and with the new restrictions, the chances of it 
happening again are about zero," Gregory said. 
</P>
<P>
Congress last month addressed one major oil-shipping safety issue by adopting a 
law that requires new tankers to be equipped with double hulls beginning in 
1995. It also set aside a $1-billion national trust fund, funded by the oil 
industry, for cleaning up spills and rehabilitating natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
The state Legislature adopted a measure that sets aside $100 million so that 
California cleanup operations can begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Whether accidental or not, spilling oil into the ocean is a crime -- a 
violation of state and federal water pollution laws. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Cano Hale, a deputy attorney general in the state's Los Angeles office, 
along with teams of city and federal lawyers, continues to gather evidence in 
preparation for filing a wide-ranging lawsuit. It is expected to target British 
Petroleum, the Cleveland-based company that owned the spilled crude oil, but it 
also could name American Trading Transportation, the New York company that owns 
the ship and employs its crew, and Golden West Refining. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the shipping company have already taken defensive action, filing 
papers in U.S. court trying to limit their liability to $8 million, the value 
of the American Trader ship. 
</P>
<P>
Together with American Trading, British Petroleum spent about $25 million 
cleaning up the oil-soaked beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The California attorney general's office, however, hopes to prove that their 
financial responsibility does not end there. The state plans to seek fines for 
water pollution violations, reimbursement of city and state cleanup costs and 
compensation for harm to the economy, recreational resources, wetlands and 
animal life. 
</P>
<P>
To solicit the public's ideas about how to compensate for the damages and 
disruption, state and federal officials will hold a public meeting Sept. 13 at 
Huntington Beach City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
At the least, the companies could face civil charges that they violated the 
California water code, which would carry a maximum fine of $20 per gallon 
spilled, or about $8 million in the American Trader case. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing in (the statute) that says we have to prove intent, negligence 
or damage," said Bruce Paine, an associate engineer with the Santa Ana Regional 
Water Quality Control Board. "You just spill the oil, and that's what it can 
cost you." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Huntington Beach recovered $250,000 from British Petroleum, about 
half the amount it spent on cleanup, including workers' overtime. The rest will 
be sought through the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
As the lawyers collect evidence and prepare to file suit, signs of the recovery 
are everywhere along the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
On one of the last, waning days of summer at his fish market near busy Newport 
Pier, dory fisherman Rick Breneman pointed to the blue waters. 
</P>
<P>
"After the oil spill, the waters around here looked like mud," he said. 
"Business really dropped off for two months. People kept asking us if the oil 
had contaminated the fish, but of course we fish way out beyond where the spill 
was. . . . Now, this summer, I'd say business is about average, the way it is 
during a summer." 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Huntington Beach was as popular with tourists as ever, according 
to the city's Conference and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty successful in getting word out that the beach was cleaned up," 
said Diane Baker, the bureau's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Beaches show no visible oil, although some residue remains in crevices of rock 
jetties that occasionally surfaces as tar balls and oil splotches during high 
tides and swells. But it is quickly cleaned up, city fire officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen any oil and I'm out there surfing almost every day," said Bobby 
Tang, 17, who works at the Frog House surf shop near the Santa Ana River mouth, 
one of the areas hit hardest by the slick. 
</P>
<P>
"On occasional days, I have seen tar balls, but not recently. I think they did 
a good job cleaning it," said Tang, adding that he rarely hears surfers talking 
about the spill anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists do not know whether all marine life will return like the surfers 
did. Grunion, killed by the thousands in February when they tried to spawn off 
Huntington Beach, began laying healthy eggs a month after the spill. There is 
no measurable long-term damage to the little silver fish, according to 
biologists with the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
However, sand-dwelling critters, such as shrimp and crabs, were almost wiped 
out by the oily tide and have shown no signs of recovery, the state biologists 
said. The tiny animals probably will repopulate the area within five years, 
they said. Results of studies on the effects on migratory sea birds have not 
been released. 
</P>
<P>
As some scars of the spill heal, environmentalists and officials worry that 
Orange County might just be having a superficial, short-lived love affair with 
ecology. 
</P>
<P>
"So often people become complacent. They tend to think Prince William Sound (in 
Alaska, where the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef and spilled 11 million gallons 
of oil in March, 1989) is on the other side of the world," said Gorman, the 
restorer of the Huntington Beach Wetlands. "It's difficult for people to 
comprehend when something happens that far away." 
</P>
<P>
"But this spill was on one of the most popular beaches in California," he said. 
"It brought home the environment story, so it was a very graphic illustration 
of what an oil spill really does."

LAZY, HAZY HOLIDAY BRINGS LIGHT BEACH CROWDS SO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Those lazy, hazy days of summer were still much in evidence as the Labor Day 
holiday weekend began Saturday with light beach crowds but heavy traffic on 
some Southern California freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards in Orange County reported few rescues, extremely calm surf and water 
temperatures of 67 degrees to 70 degrees. But there were a few stingray-induced 
injuries at Bolsa Chica State Beach and Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The cars and rescues have been mellow, but one guy's toe got gnarlied by a 
stingray," said Tom Cormack, a senior park aide at Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Halphide, a lifeguard dispatcher at Newport Beach, said: "It's been a 
surprisingly low crowd today. Maybe it was the overcast in the morning, or 
maybe just the predictions of holiday gridlock. . . . It makes it better for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
At Los Angeles International Airport, operations officers described road 
traffic as "light in the morning and moderate in the afternoon." They said the 
crush of holiday drivers, however, forced them to operate parking lots on a 
"limited basis," meaning that motorists were not allowed to enter until someone 
pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
Security officers said car traffic was moderate, with no major problems 
reported at Orange County's John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest inland attraction Saturday was the 18th annual Orange International 
Street Fair, in downtown Orange. Organizers said they expect that by time the 
fair closes tonight, 400,000 people will have attended. 
</P>
<P>
At Castaic Lake north of Newhall, where Los Angeles County officials had closed 
the swimming area because of potential problems with high bacterial counts, 
"the crowds were very light because of all the publicity, even though we really 
haven't had a case of a sick swimmer all year," manager Charles Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
Local freeway traffic "was quite heavy, but they're behaving themselves out 
there and not banging each other up too badly," said California Highway Patrol 
Officer Vince Zambrana. 
</P>
<P>
Drunk-driving arrests were down to 175, in contrast with 243 in the same period 
last year, Zambrana added. Some of the reduction, he said, may have been from a 
concentrated effort by Los Angeles Police Department traffic officers Friday 
night, in which 101 drivers were snagged at three sobriety checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
The weather is expected to remain warm, with temperatures climbing to about 80 
with hazy skies. Light smog is expected in some inland areas.

<P>
Adam Hughes is only 5, but he's doing his best to act older. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do OK," the prospective kindergartner said about his upcoming first day 
at Cordillera Elementary School here. 
</P>
<P>
With the confidence of a pupil who has already faced first-day-of-school 
jitters, Adam described the bright blue-and-black school clothes he selected 
last weekend shopping with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
There are the neon-colored T-shirts to wear with his jeans, sneakers, a 
backpack, a lunch box, folders and pencils -- all in neons, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"He's looking forward to it," said his mother, Kelly Hughes. "He can hardly 
wait." 
</P>
<P>
If Adam is excited, so are the adults -- the parents, teachers and even some of 
the older high school students who are veterans at handling the back-to-school 
season. Forget last year's below-average grades, lost high school football 
games, late car pools and other disappointments. Many are ready for a clean 
start. 
</P>
<P>
The spit and polish is being applied to almost 500 schools across Orange 
County, which will play host to an expected 360,000 kindergarten-through-high 
school students who will begin classes as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
Some schools, including those in the Orange Unified and Buena Park districts, 
begin classes Tuesday. Others, including Santa Ana Unified, Newport-Mesa 
Unified and most elementary school districts, will start Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
While most schools are expecting about the same or slightly higher enrollment, 
Santa Ana Unified School District spokeswoman Diane M. Thomas said that her 
district will continue its 10-year trend of enrollment increases of 1,000 to 
2,000 students yearly. 
</P>
<P>
A larger enrollment is also expected at Garden Grove Unified School District, 
reversing a downward trend, spokesman Alan Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
"After a 20-year decline, our enrollment increased this year," he said, adding 
that 659 more students are expected this year over last year's total of 36,725. 
</P>
<P>
In the Placentia Unified District, 14 temporary buildings are in place for the 
new Bryant Ranch Elementary School, where 350 Yorba Linda pupils will attend 
classes until the permanent facility is built and opened next year. The school 
is being built because the pupil population is expanding, a school official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the county, other schools, teachers, students and parents are also 
preparing for the first day of classes. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at Garden Grove Unified's bus barn have been washing the 87 buses 
before classes begin. The district claims to own the largest fleet of school 
buses in the county. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to decorating her classroom for special-needs pupils at Helen 
Estock Elementary School in Tustin, teacher Sandy Banis was on the telephone 
with a computer vendor, trying to find out whether she will have her computer 
printer in operation before school begins. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy my summers," said Banis, who is starting her 14th year of teaching, 
"but it's nice to get back to school and see all the growth and changes in the 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Coffee of Mission Viejo has also been preparing her youngest daughter, 
Katherine, for kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
Although Katherine tends to be shy at first, her mother said, she has seen her 
older sister go through a few years of school and is now ready to try it 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think she will have a problem," Coffee said. "I may have a problem. 
She's my little girl." 
</P>
<P>
While not too particular about her new school wardrobe, Coffee's daughter was 
adamant about one thing. 
</P>
<P>
"She had to have tight jeans," Hughes said. "Form-fitting and not baggy." 
</P>
<P>
As a gardener manicured the lawn at Santa Ana High School this week, dance team 
members joined the band and flag corps on the practice field. This will be the 
first year the dance team performs with the band during football halftimes. 
</P>
<P>
The marching units were a little slow in responding to the drill commands 
issued by band camp instructor Mark Petrash, a Cal State Fullerton music major. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon guys. Saddleback's a lot faster than you guys," he said, hoping to 
inspire a competitive spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more enthusiastic band members was Lori Hansen, a sophomore in the 
clarinet section, who is happy to see her summer job as a receptionist come to 
an end. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked all summer. Getting back to school will be a rest," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But not all students are as enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is ever ready for school," sophomore Jackie Guzman said. "I think the 
summer is too short." 
</P>
<P>
Guzman's T-shirt was emblazoned with cartoon character Bart Simpson -- a 
character that clearly remains popular in the school supplies market, despite 
concerns of some teachers who complained last year that the rebellious cartoon 
character is not a positive influence on students. 
</P>
<P>
One Fullerton store manager said folders and notebooks decorated with Bart 
Simpson, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or the New Kids on the Block rock band 
are the most popular. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been much different from last year," K mart store Manager Steve 
Crossen said. "The only thing abnormal is all the Bart Simpson stuff." 
</P>
<P>
What is new is a fashion style that is old. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the kids are really going toward the look that's more '60s-ish," said 
Renee Bowman, assistant manager at a ClothesTime store in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
That look includes more cottons instead of suede and leather, feminine lacy 
tops for girls and solid, bright colors instead of prints. 
</P>
<P>
"And jeans, once again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For a new kid on the block, Adam Hughes apparently knew the current fashion 
trend when he picked his new school wardrobe. 
</P>

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: RESEARCH GRANTS US ALL FAVORS

The record $78 million in research grants and contracts brought home by UC 
Irvine scientists in the last year is a hefty sum. With it, researchers are 
studying everything from quarks and gluons to the behavior of aged rats to 
carbon compounds distributed in the troposphere. 
</P>
<P>
Some might question the value of such esoteric inquiries in the face of myriad 
budget crises threatening Orange County schools and programs for the indigent, 
sick and homeless. UCI physics professor emeritus Frederick Reines doesn't even 
wait to be asked. 
</P>
<P>
"What's in it for us? I submit that basic research is the linchpin on which all 
of modern society is built," said the 72-year-old professor, whose co-discovery 
of neutrinos in the 1950s is frequently mentioned by fellow scientists as 
deserving of a Nobel prize. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we make use of technology, where did it come from? It came from 
fundamental research," Reines said. 
</P>
<P>
And for vote-counting politicians who would waffle on the need for megabucks 
research on super colliders or peering into distant galaxies, he recalls 
Michael Faraday's remark to a government minister who asked the practical use 
of the British scientist's latest discovery: "Oh that? Why, someday you may tax 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Spending dollars at home instead of on pie-in-the-sky research is a perennial 
argument that gains steam in tough times. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have produced 
public service announcements to counter such notions. The television spots 
remind the public that the nation's multibillion-dollar space program has led 
to beneficial offshoots such as miniature computers, heat-resistant materials, 
even the MREs (Meals, Ready-to-Eat) being uh, enjoyed, by the U.S. soldiers now 
hunkered in the Saudi Arabian dunes.

For Paul Sypherd, UCI's vice chancellor for research, basic research is a "pool 
of knowledge" about the human species and the universe around it. And it is 
from that pool that information is taken and developed into technologies that 
have transformed society. 
</P>
<P>
"Take Newton's laws of thermodynamics, also called Newton's law of gravity," 
Sypherd said. "These are very basic physical observations about how the 
universe works and the relationships between bodies in that universe. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no application of these thoughts in Newton's time; it was basic 
research," he said. "But just imagine trying to put together the American space 
program without Newton's law that for every action there is an equal and 
opposite reaction -- which is the basis of jet propulsion and rocketry." 
</P>
<P>
The most important biological discovery of the century has been cracking the 
mystery of DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic code within living things. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually all of modern biology is founded on that discovery," Sypherd said. 
Everything from understanding how the (AIDS) virus produces AIDS to the 
development of better drugs, the treatment of diabetes, even understanding 
Alzheimer's disease." 
</P>
<P>
All of it sprang from the most fundamental research by British biophysicist 
Francis H.C. Crick and American biologist James Watson at Cambridge 
University's Strangeways Research Laboratory in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"These people were doing it because it was their job as natural scientists," 
Sypherd said. 
</P>
<P>
Another example is the laser, for which Albert Einstein wrote the first 
equation early this century. It would be decades before practical uses emerged. 
</P>
<P>
"You can hardly turn two degrees today without seeing lasers and their 
applications," Reines said. "Now, it's a several-billion-dollar-a-year 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Basic research, as far as Reines is concerned, is "one of the best investments 
society can make. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us choices which are beyond our wildest expectations. It does not 
necessarily make problems simpler. But it gives one a range of possibilities. . 
. . It's the sure way to expand the horizon of the country and the world. It's 
what's for tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond it all, there is a deep drive within human beings when they look up at 
the stars to want to understand their universe, the physicist said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes life worth living."

NEW CITIES PREFER DEPUTIES TO CREATING LOCAL FORCE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE COST OF CONTRACTING WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IS A 
BURDEN. BUT THE ALTERNATIVE CAN BE TOO DAUNTING.

When Dana Point City Manager William O. Talley scans his budget for next year, 
one number keeps glaring back at him: $3.4 million, the amount it costs to buy 
police service from the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we had opted for no increase in service this year, the cost still 
would have been $400,000 over last year," said Talley, who manages the beach 
town of about 30,000 residents. "It's just another way the county socks it to 
the cities." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, police costs for the four cities in South County that contract with the 
Sheriff's Department -- Laguna Niguel, Dana Point, San Juan Capistrano and 
Mission Viejo -- are up 13% this year, according to Linda Robinson, contract 
manager for the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
And now, with the Board of Supervisors studying a proposal to charge cities 
$75.50 for each person booked into County Jail, those costs may jump even 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Talley and other city managers, there's little choice in the 
matter. For new cities in Orange County these days, starting a small-town 
police department seems to be out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the cost so much as it is the time it would take," Talley said. 
"First you'd have to go through the recruiting process of hiring a chief. Then 
there's the time spent outfitting people, buying guns and so forth. We're 
talking about probably two years of lead time." 
</P>
<P>
That's how long it took Irvine, the last city in the county to incorporate and 
assemble a police department, 18 years ago. Paul O. Brady Jr., city manager of 
Irvine, was part of the team that recruited a police chief and put together a 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Brady said small cities have no business trying to form their own police 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a firm believer that cities with less than 50,000 people have a hard time 
-- even though they may want local control -- justifying their own police 
department," said Brady, a former Santa Barbara County sheriff's deputy. "You 
can't justify it because you can't compete with other communities, and often (a 
small-town police force) cannot do the same job a bigger department can." 
</P>
<P>
Small departments have a hard time competing with the salaries offered by large 
departments, officials said. Smaller cities often train rookie officers who are 
then recruited by a larger operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people will come along and offer to pay better wages and better fringe 
benefits," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
That's what was happening in Stanton until 1988, when so many young recruits 
were lured away to better-paying jobs that the city dismantled its Police 
Department and hired the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Small-city police departments have gone the way of the mom-and-pop grocery 
store, the neighborhood sporting goods store and the local hardware store," 
said Greg Beaubien, assistant city manager of Stanton. "It's very difficult for 
small departments in this county, not only on a cost-effective basis but 
service-deliverywise. It's hard to recruit officers to work in small cities and 
then keep them here if you do get them." 
</P>
<P>
What small-city police departments can offer is local control, said Albert C. 
Ehlow, chief of the 60-year-old San Clemente Police Department. That, Ehlow 
added, and a certain camaraderie that exists among a small group of officers 
patrolling a small town. 
</P>
<P>
"A police department in a small town has more control over what goes on in its 
own city," Ehlow explained. "I'm not saying the Sheriff's Department doesn't do 
a fine job, because it does. But I think it's different working for a large 
entity than working for a community. There's a special bonding that develops in 
a small department. . . . Working in a large department may offer more 
opportunities, but then more people compete for those opportunities. It's a 
trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has tried to adopt the concept of local control by 
customizing its department to serve individual communities. Excepting overtime 
shifts, Mission Viejo deputies work only in Mission Viejo and drive department 
vehicles with "Mission Viejo" stenciled on the sides. The same is true for 
other cities the Sheriff's Department serves. 
</P>
<P>
"Our deputies are our deputies and are assigned permanently to us," said Fred 
Sorsabal, city manager of the 29-month-old city of Mission Viejo, which will 
spend $4.88 million for police services this year. "I don't think local control 
is a real issue with our police services. We are able to customize our own 
service level to what we want. If you want more police, you pay more, but you 
can have them." 
</P>
<P>
The quality of service provided by the Sheriff's Department is not an issue, 
city managers agree. Since the department had already been patrolling the South 
County communities before they incorporated, it was a natural transition to 
remain in charge after they became cities, said Assistant Sheriff Dennis 
LaDucer. 
</P>
<P>
"We already have a close relationship established with the community," said 
LaDucer, who also believes it makes economic sense for the smaller communities 
to turn to the Sheriff's Department rather than start their own police service. 
"We have an economy of scale that allows us to spread the costs to all the 
cities." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department also offers cities a full-service police force, 
something many small cities cannot provide for themselves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people say they have a full-service police department, but do they 
have a bomb squad, or maybe a canine squad?" LaDucer noted. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years ago, however, quality of service and local control were the main 
reasons the city of Irvine formed its own department, Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
"Local control and response time were the issues. This community demanded more 
police service than the Sheriff's Department was in the position to provide at 
that time," he said. "We were looking to transfer to our own department as 
quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine spent its first year under contract with the Sheriff's Department and 
then switched to having Costa Mesa police patrol its streets for the next two 
years, until its own force was ready to hit the streets in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Although some officials in South County cities like the idea of one day having 
their own police department, they say the Sheriff's Department, for now, still 
offers a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
"As costs accumulate, we'll take a look at other alternatives," Sorsabal said. 
"But as long as the Sheriff's Department can offer Mission Viejo the kind of 
service it has been doing for a reasonable price, we're happy with what we're 
doing."

AIRPORT TERMINAL GALAS RANGE FROM FIRST-CLASS TO COACH

The John Wayne statue is squeaky clean. Artwork is being installed. The gift 
shops are stocking their shelves with everything from sweets to sweats. And 
with costly construction snafus behind them, Orange County officials plan to 
whoop it up this week with galas celebrating the completion of the $62-million 
Thomas F. Riley Terminal at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all worked very hard for a very long time," said Courtney Wiercioch, the 
airport's spokeswoman and special projects director. "It's time to let the 
public enjoy this achievement." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, while crews from McDonald's were still putting the final touches on 
its airport burger boutiques and airlines installed computer equipment, 
officials waited nervously as county fire inspectors continued to watch over a 
nettlesome bug in the new terminal's computerized automatic fire-suppression 
system. It finally worked right. 
</P>
<P>
Weary but beaming airport officials were confident that a necessary certificate 
of occupancy would be issued in time to host a series of events, ranging from a 
media luncheon and tour to a $50-per-person, black-tie reception Friday night 
-- all as a prelude to the terminal's first use by commercial airlines Sept. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
And although the galas scheduled this week appear to be geared toward VIPs and 
others on the top rung of Orange County's social ladder, airport officials 
insisted that the events target different segments of the public. 
</P>
<P>
The massive, domed structure -- part of the county's biggest-ever public works 
project -- will serve up to 8.4 million passengers per year, compared to the 
Edward J. (Eddie) Martin Terminal, built in 1967, which now serves 4.5 million 
passengers annually. 
</P>
<P>
Grand opening festivities actually began with a children's art reception Aug. 
8, followed by a special video preview Aug. 23 for VIPs and sponsors of 
upcoming airport events. Last Thursday night, former baseball commissioner 
Peter Ueberroth addressed more than 100 members of the Young Presidents, a 
group of youthful entrepreneurs and corporate CEOs, who also saw a slide show 
presented by Airport Manager George Rebella. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the same news media that perplexed county officials with a steady 
diet of bad news about construction problems and cost overruns at the new 
terminal will be treated to a luncheon at the Radisson Plaza Hotel and a guided 
tour of the 337,900-square-foot Riley terminal. 
</P>
<P>
An inaugural arts exhibition, at which full-size color photographs of artwork 
commissioned for the new terminal, will be held during a wine and cheese 
reception scheduled for 5 p.m. Wednesday at the Robert Mondavi Wine and Food 
Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Paintings, prints and sculptures selected for the terminal include "Airplanes," 
by Doug Moran, an artist who pilots his own plane, "Parked Vehicles," by 
Michael Chapman, and works by Frank Romero, George James and Stephanie Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of the rich and not-so-rich will mingle at the black-tie, 
invitation-only reception Friday from 7 to 11 p.m. that will feature cocktails, 
hors d'oeuvres and a sound-and-light spectacular. More than 4,000 invitations 
have been sent out, but sponsors said they had no idea yet how many people will 
actually attend. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, however, is the official dedication day and public open house. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a VIP brunch in the terminal. Then a Boeing 757 donated by an 
airline will take wing bearing all five county supervisors (in the first-class 
section) and an entourage of airport boosters who paid $250 each in advance. 
The hourlong flight will take the plane out over Catalina Island and then back 
to the new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
The open house, scheduled from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., will include an on-stage 
dedication ceremony at 11:30 a.m., free tours of the facility, visits to the 
airport rescue and firefighting station on the airfield's west side, airline 
exhibits, free gifts, prizes, food, vintage aircraft displays, Disney character 
photos, postal stamp sales and a pictorial stamp cancellation, plus a series of 
performances by dance troupes, musicians and magicians. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the airport staff will reward itself with a barbecue on the roof bof a 
parking garage on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the events are for the public, Wiercioch said. Referring to the 
black-tie reception, she explained that it is for that segment of the 
population that was affiliated in some way with the project, ranging from 
airport contractors and subcontractors to former airport managers and even 
people who helped prepare the environmental impact report for the airport's 
$310-million improvement program. 
</P>
<P>
"The art program serves another group of people, and the dedication and open 
house are for everyone," Wiercioch said. 
</P>
<P>
It all comes after a 5 1/2-month delay in completion, legal battles between the 
county and prime contractor Taylor Woodrow California Construction Ltd., 
problems that ranged from "lost" marble to improperly aligned support columns, 
and change orders that so far have boosted the cost to more than $62 million, 
give or take a few million pending a final accounting. 
</P>
<P>
The new terminal is named for Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, in whose district the 
airport is located. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he has been visiting the site almost every day to reassure himself 
that the terminal will be ready for this week's celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited," Riley said. "This is one of the best things I've been 
associated with in my whole life."

Ignorance is bliss, according to the cliche. But for Kathy and Terry Collier, 
the parents of Army Pvt. Darrin Collier, ignorance is agony. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other county parents with military sons and daughters in the Middle 
East, the Colliers, who live in Buena Park, have had little contact with their 
24-year-old son since he shipped out from Fort Bragg, N.C., on Aug. 11 to an 
unknown base in the Saudi desert. The Army will not permit him to say where he 
is and where he might end up. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than sit by the phone or the mailbox awaiting further word from 
Darrin, the Colliers have filled the anxious hours by forming a support group 
"for proud families of our military." In just three weeks, 60 families and 
friends of servicemen and women have called seeking a sympathetic ear, Kathy 
Collier said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had numerous calls from people who were in tears the first week this 
happened," she said. "I've talked for 10 or 15 minutes to people about how hard 
it is to deal with this situation. There have been a lot of people who needed 
somebody to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing for all of us to deal with is that this happened so fast. We 
didn't have time to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Colliers and other volunteers with sons and daughters deployed 
in Saudi Arabia set up a small table bedecked with yellow ribbons in the Buena 
Park Mall to provide information on the group and to sign up new members. Among 
the volunteers was Ginny France, an Anaheim resident whose son, Marine Cpl. Don 
France, saw combat in Panama in December and shipped out two weeks ago from 
Camp Lejeune, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where he is right now," said France, who said she has not seen 
her 22-year-old son for 2 1/2 years. "He could be in the middle of the 
Atlantic." 
</P>
<P>
She added that "the toughest thing for me is listening to the news before I go 
to sleep and listening when I get up, and hoping there's nothing new." 
</P>
<P>
France, who wore a small pendant pinned to her blouse with a picture of her son 
in his Marine dress blue uniform, said she last heard from her son in a 
five-minute telephone call before he shipped out. She reacted excitedly to the 
news that the Colliers have received two letters from their son since he 
arrived in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
While the letters were comforting, Terry Collier said he is concerned that 
neither letter from his son mentioned the 12 letters he and his wife and other 
relatives have sent in the last two weeks. He said he feared that young men and 
women deployed far from home have not been receiving mail. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fellows are the ones over there -- they must be concerned about why they 
haven't heard anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The support group "is not only to support ourselves, but we're trying to garner 
support for our people in the field," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Colliers and other volunteers will be in Buena Park Mall again on Labor Day 
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., outside of the east entrance to May Co., to answer 
questions about the support group. 
</P>
<P>
The group's first public meeting will at 2 p.m. Sept. 9 at Crescent Southern 
Baptist Church, 622 N. Gilbert St., Anaheim. Those interested are asked to call 
(714) 522-8178 by Wednesday.

EDISON'S DEFENSE GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS IN SHUTOUT VICTORY IN HONOLULU;

FOOTBALL: CHARGERS INTERCEPT THREE PASSES AND LIMIT IOLANI TO 25 YARDS RUSHING 
IN 12-0 TRIUMPH.

<TEXT>
<P>
Edison High School football Coach Dave White spent game day snorkeling in 
Hanauma Bay, maintaining a low-key approach toward his team's season opener. 
</P>
<P>
But White and his team were all business Friday night at Aloha Stadium. The 
Chargers limited Iolani to 25 yards rushing in a 12-0 victory in front of 4,200 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
Edison scored the only points it needed in the second quarter when Chip 
Anderson blocked a punt that rolled out of Iolani's end zone for a safety and a 
2-0 lead. The Chargers had problems getting untracked on offense and had to 
settle for a field goal by Brent Hanson and a three-yard touchdown run by 
Travis Balding in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"This looked like the first game of the year in Hawaii," White said. "There 
wasn't a lot of consistency or continuity by our offense. We didn't look poised 
at times, especially in the first half, but we got a shutout." 
</P>
<P>
Edison intercepted Iolani quarterback Paul Ah Yat three times and limited 
Hawaii's top returning quarterback to 101 yards passing with a strong pass 
rush. Ah Yat completed eight of 25 passes and was sacked five times. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that team has ever seen defensive linemen as quick as ours," 
said Mike Cunningham, Edison's standout free safety. "I'd say 80% of the time 
we didn't have to worry about their passing game because our line was putting 
the pressure on him (Ah Yat)." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham was clearly the best player on the field, returning five punts for 
81 yards, catching six passes for 77 yards and intercepting a pass. Mike Eidam 
and Danny Steinle also had interceptions for Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's special teams were also impressive. Hanson, who doubles as a punter 
and kicker, averaged 43.2 yards per punt and put three kickoffs into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We did some good things, but we still have a long ways to go," White said. 
"Cunningham made some great individual plays. Our kicking game was very good 
and we got three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"But it looks like our defense and kicking game is going to have to carry us 
for a while. We lost all of our offensive starters except Cunningham and it 
showed." 
</P>
<P>
Edison struggled to get 61 yards rushing and quarterback Josh Gingrich was 
sporadic, completing 11 of 20 passes for 128 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback J.R. Schusterick gained 55 yards in 16 carries. He had eight runs in 
which he was held to no gain or minus yardage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were trying to do too much offensively," Cunningham said. "Our 
defense did well, but we had some mental mistakes. But I think everybody will 
be happy going home with a win." 
</P>
<P>
Edison's victory celebration at its hotel was interrupted by police officers. 
About 300 parents and boosters gathered in the hotel lobby and when 
cheerleaders began shouting, "Fight, fight, fight," hotel administrators called 
the police, thinking a fight had started.

PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE PREVIEW;

<P>
The Pacific Coast League opens the 1990 football season with a new look -- two 
new teams and a new playoff division -- but coaches throughout the league 
expect the same old story in November. 
</P>
<P>
Another league championship for Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia, last season's Sea View League champions, and Century, fielding its 
first varsity team, have been added to the Pacific Coast League. They replace 
Orange, now in the Century League, and Woodbridge, now in the Sea View League. 
</P>
<P>
The new teams, along with Laguna Beach, Laguna Hills and Costa Mesa, hope to 
end Trabuco Hills' grip on the league championship. The Mustangs have won the 
past two league titles and the Division VIII championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who wins back to back championships has to be the favorite again," 
Laguna Hills Coach Steve Bresnahan said. "You can't destroy a winning tradition 
like that. The kids there want to keep that up. Trabuco has that now, and 
they're in an area that's expanding." 
</P>
<P>
Estancia Coach John Liebengood said he's excited about moving into the same 
league as Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenge, especially playing the defending (state) champs from the 
last two years," he said. "In the Sea View League, we played teams of the same 
quality. I think Trabuco will be in (the same company) with El Toro and Mission 
Viejo in years to come." 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches think Trabuco Hills has a lock on the title. But you won't find 
Trabuco Hills Coach Jim Barnett talking about "three-peating" as champs. 
</P>
<P>
"The only pressure for that is pressure we put on ourselves," Barnett said. "If 
the Lakers can't do it, we shouldn't feel any pressure. Hey, if Magic can't 
handle it, what the heck?" 
</P>
<P>
Should Trabuco Hills win another league title, the Mustangs won't advance to 
the Division VIII playoffs, but to the Division VII playoffs instead. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Coast League has moved up a division. The Division VII playoff 
format has six leagues instead of the customary five, which means only the top 
two teams from each league, instead of the top three, will be guaranteed 
playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
It's a simple case of mathematics. But don't tell that to Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's stupid," he said. "It's so unfair to do that. It's the most unfair 
situation I've ever encountered. A team in the Sea View League (Division VI) 
can finish third and get in while an 8-2 team that happens to finish third in 
our league doesn't get in." 
</P>
<P>
Said Laguna Beach Coach Lyman Olney: "It hurts the morale of the league a 
little. We might have one or two teams that are a little stronger. While others 
are almost ready, a third-place team won't make it." 
</P>
<P>
CENTURY: Coach Bill Brown tries to keep some perspective when talking about his 
all-underclassman lineup, which will play its first varsity game Friday against 
El Dorado. "Our strength is that we don't graduate anyone," Brown said. 
"Everyone will be back next year. We'll just see how we do. We have no 
delusions of grandeur. We have to get some seniors to be good. We're 
inexperienced at the skill positions, but we have good kids there. We're asking 
sophomores to grow up a year right now." 
</P>
<P>
COSTA MESA: The Mustangs return Quoc Pham, a three-year starter and two-year 
all-league selection at defensive back, along with a trio of fine receivers -- 
tight end Josh Hill, wide receiver Duby Ospina and wide receiver David 
Phillips, the team's most valuable player last year. 
</P>
<P>
But it'll be up to Ryan McEvoy, an untested junior quarterback, to get them the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"He has had a good spring and summer," Baldwin said. "He's played only one game 
on varsity, our last game against Woodbridge last season, but he has been 
throwing the ball well so far." 
</P>
<P>
Jermaine Jackson, a transfer from Saddleback, should boost the Mustangs' 
running attack, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're running a pro set this year and we'll need a back back there who can 
gain a lot of yards for us," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
ESTANCIA: The player who has Liebengood talking is sophomore quarterback Matt 
Johner, who has no varsity experience. 
</P>
<P>
Johner, a 6-2, 175-pound left-hander, is challenging junior Richard Buday (6-0, 
185) for the starting job. "Matt has one of the strongest arms I've seen on a 
15-year-old," Liebengood said. "He and Rich are really going at it. Matt's a 
great basketball player and a good baseball player. He gave up baseball to 
concentrate on football, and now the baseball coaches are mad at me." 
</P>
<P>
LAGUNA BEACH: The Artists won only one game last season, but Olney thinks this 
year's team could surprise some people. 
</P>
<P>
"We were competitive last year," he said. "For us, it's all a numbers game. We 
have between 40 to 50 kids out for the varsity, less than most schools. We have 
some good athletes, but not much speed. We have to work for more intensity and 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
"Our league is very, very competitive. We can all beat each other. We have 
proven that." 
</P>
<P>
Olney said the Artists will "have a balanced attack." 
</P>
<P>
"Our running backs (Jason Levinson, Keith Perry, RB) are very versatile," Olney 
said. "Our quarterback (Morgan Lanchantain) can give us more running ability 
and our offensive line is pretty decent. Defensively, we will be real solid." 
</P>
<P>
LAGUNA HILLS: Bresnahan credits the Hawks' weightlifting program for turning 
one of the weakest teams in the league a few years ago into one of the 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, we didn't have an offensive lineman who could bench-press 150 
pounds," Bresnahan said. "This year, Mark Maddux is at 350 on the bench, which 
is competitive. I think the weight program has made our players not only 
better, but also gave them confidence to play well. There's no compromise for 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"We're better, stronger and faster. We're committed to winning here." 
</P>
<P>
TRABUCO HILLS: The Mustangs will be tested early and often. Their nonleague 
schedule includes Corona del Mar, Woodbridge, Dana Hills and Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a tough preseason," Barnett said. "Estancia plays a tough preseason. I 
think Laguna Hills will come into the league as the top preseason team." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said he'll miss Tim Manning, an all-league selection at quarterback and 
defensive back. Senior Shane Weintraut and sophomore Pat Barnes are competing 
for Manning's quarterback job. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you lose a quarterback, one you don't get in high school very often, 
one with his character and intelligence, you're definitely going to miss him," 
Barnett said. "But Pat has a lot of potential and Shane was our junior varsity 
quarterback. It's a dead heat between them right now." 
</P>

<P>
Outlook: Experience? What experience? Brown, a former coach at Brea-Olinda, is 
hoping his all-underclassman roster will mature quickly. Century High, which is 
in its second year, is fielding its first varsity team. The Centurions fielded 
only junior varsity and freshman teams last year, with the junior varsity 
finishing 4-6 and the freshmen 9-4. Brown will be counting on quarterback Mario 
Chavarria, who didn't even play football last year, to learn the ropes. Last 
year's junior varsity quarterback, Karlo Balderrama, was moved to running back 
after undergoing surgery on his right throwing shoulder last season. "Mario has 
looked pretty good so far," Brown said. "But we're not going to be any 
offensive wizards."

<P>
Outlook: It can't get any worse than this. Baldwin will be the first to tell 
you that he was upset with the winless season. "We need a win badly this year," 
he said. "Losing creates problems and winning solves them. It's soul-searching 
time for us. I felt we should have won half our games last year, but we had 
some chemistry problems, some injuries, lots of excuses. I guess you have to 
eat some crow sometimes." The Mustangs return a solid nucleus, including David 
Phillips, a two-way starter at wide receiver and linebacker and the team's most 
valuable player last year.

<P>
Outlook: "There's no doubt we're a junior-oriented team," Liebengood said. Most 
of the juniors moved up from the 10-0 sophomore team. "It's hard to say if 
we're a year away," he said, "but it's also hard to say if we're ready yet when 
haven't seen them play in a game. But I do know that this group has worked 
harder than any group I've had. Only one player has missed a day of two-a-days 
(practices)."

Outlook: The season hasn't even started, and the Artists' secondary already has 
suffered two major setbacks. Cornerback Steve Kiemer broke his leg in practice 
and is out for the season. Safety Ted King suffered an injury unrelated to 
football and is questionable for the season. Olney is confident the Artists can 
rebound from one of their most disappointing seasons. "We're hoping to be right 
up there contending for a playoff berth," he said. "No one is going to breeze 
in here and say, 'We're playing Laguna Beach,' and just blow on by." Olney said 
Lanchantain, who moved to quarterback from running back, will give the Artists 
a double-threat as a passer and a rusher. 
</P>

Sr.; Casey Sullivan, QB, 6-2, 195, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Laguna Hills surprised many last year, slipping into the Division VIII 
playoffs and upsetting top-seeded Yucaipa in the first round. "It was a 
successful season, but we're still improving as a team," Bresnahan said. 
Sullivan, a transfer quarterback from St. Monica, already has improved the 
Hawks' passing attack. "I'm real impressed with Casey," Bresnahan said. "He was 
all-league at St. Monica. He's a Division I (college) quarterback in size (6-2, 
185) and in competitiveness and confidence. I coached for a couple of years at 
Long Beach State (as an assistant), and Casey compares favorably with 
quarterbacks I saw there." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jim Barnett (fifth year) 
</P>
<P>
1989 record: 13-1, 5-0 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: 22 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: three on offense; three on defense 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Mark Florence, LB, 6-0, 190, Sr.; Julian Ford, TE, 6-2, 215, 
Sr.; Ben Rooker, RB, 6-3 , 225, Sr.; Al Sermeno, OL-DL, 6-3, 255, Sr.; Brett 
Sutherland, S-WR, 6-0, 175, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Nick Pivaroff, TE-WR-S, 6-0, 185, Sr.; Jeff Clayton, RB, 5-10, 
170, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Mustangs have some holes to fill, returning only six starters from 
last year's team that won the Division VIII title for the second consecutive 
year. The biggest losses are in the secondary and at quarterback. Tim Manning, 
who earned a scholarship to California, was a threat as a passer and a runner 
and, as a defensive back he set the county career interception record with 24. 
Also missing from the secondary are Ricky Sparks (16 interceptions in the past 
two seasons) and all-league selection Greg Hughes. But the Mustangs return some 
solid players. Tight end Julian Ford has caught 17 touchdown passes in the last 
two seasons and running back Ben Rooker had two 200-yard games last season 
despite battling knee injuries. Tackle Al Sermeno, another returning starter, 
is among the top 10 linemen in the county.

LATEST INJURY LIST HAS ROBINSON SCRAMBLING TO BUILD UP RANKS

<TEXT>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson isn't ready to deal with all the reverberations of the 
jarring collision between cornerbacks Jerry Gray and Alfred Jackson during 
Friday night's 37-10 exhibition loss to the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, no getting around certain facts: Gray and Jackson probably 
will be out at least a month; the roster must be trimmed to 47 players on 
Monday, and, if the Rams had to play today, Latin Berry -- a rookie who is 
making the conversion from college fullback to pro cornerback -- would be a 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some damage control to do," Robinson said Saturday. "Obviously, 
we're desperate, but we're still trying to evaluate our position. I just can't 
tell you today who's going where and who's going to do what. Frankly, I'm not 
sure yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to move somebody out there (to cornerback)? Is a great corner 
going to walk in here tomorrow like in the movie, 'The Natural'? We have some 
decisions to make, but we have some time. So before we make the decisions, 
we're going to review our options. When we're ready with a plan, we'll let you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
That plan could include a trade for a cornerback. Good corners don't come 
cheap, however, which means the Rams, already short on bodies, probably would 
have to part with some high-round draft choices. They also could hold out and 
see who shows up on the waiver wire after Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, if the Rams' Sept. 9 season opener against the Green Bay Packers 
were today, they would have 17 players who would be out or questionable, and a 
number of others who would be playing without having practiced much in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at the Ram medical wards, by position: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SECONDARY 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback Jerry Gray (who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Saturday), 
out four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback Darryl Henley (hip), out for as much as the first half of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback Alfred Jackson (groin injury), probably out four weeks. "It's a 
little bit uncertain," Robinson said, "but we think it's a major injury." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Safety Michael Stewart, healthy but still a holdout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LINEBACKER 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mel Owens (back), out four to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Larry Kelm (who underwent knee surgery Saturday), out four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fred Strickland (hamstring), could be available against Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frank Stams (slight groin strain), probable. "If Frank's hurt, I don't want 
to know about it," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
(The situation at outside linebacker improved Saturday when Kevin Greene 
signed. But if Stams and Strickland can't play the Rams will face the Packers 
without their two starting inside linebackers and both backups). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brian Smith (knee), Bill Hawkins (knee), Mike Piel (elbow) and Alvin Wright 
(quadriceps) are all recovering from injuries, but will play in the season 
opener. "We've only got four players, but they all made it through the game," 
Robinson said, managing a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tackle Doug Reed, healthy but holding out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RECEIVER 
</P>
<P>
 -- Henry Ellard (hamstring), should practice this week and "should" be 
available for the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Flipper Anderson (hamstring), see Ellard. Robinson says Anderson's injury 
is more serious than Ellard's, which the coach describes as "nagging." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Aaron Cox (hamstring), doubtful for Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tony Lomack (hamstring), out at least one week. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tight end Damone Johnson, healthy but holding out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tackle Jackie Slater (dislocated toe), will miss at least one game, maybe 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tackle Robert Cox (cracked ribs and separated cartilage), possible for 
Green Bay game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tackle Irv Pankey (back), probable for the opener. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Guard Joe Milinichik (broken thumb), questionable, but could play against 
the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RUNNING BACK 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cleveland Gary (back), out most of the last month and has yet to play a 
preseason game in his career. He could make the opener if he can make it 
through a week of practice . . . something he hasn't been able to do this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than that, we're OK," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former Ram defensive end Gary Jeter, a 13-year veteran who was released Tuesday 
by the New England Patriots, failed his physical with the Rams Saturday. "He's 
not going to be with us," Coach John Robinson said. "He has a back injury that 
is at a place where the doctors recommend that he retire." . . . Bright Spot 
Dept.: "Last night, we played a game where we had very little offense, threw an 
interception, fumbled the ball and had a kickoff run back (for a touchdown) 
against us, all things that are usually disastrous," Robinson said. "But I was 
pleased with the punter." Keith English, acquired Tuesday in a trade with the 
San Diego Chargers, averaged 41.1 yards in six kicks against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The injury tidal wave is washing over the Rams and causing a plethora of 
related problems. "It's shocking how many problems it causes," Robinson said. 
"There are so many people not practicing that the ones who are are tired from 
taking extra turns. There's problems on special teams. Everywhere you turn, 
there's damage control. But part of winning in this league is dealing with 
these kinds of problems. We'll find solutions. If we play these first three 
games in a highly emotional state and play efficient and effective football, we 
can win all three." . . . The Rams, who weren't too happy when the schedule was 
announced and discovered they had a bye in Week 4, are now looking at it as a 
blessing.

WOODS, BOOTH COMPETE IN JUNIOR TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The East team took a 9-6 lead on Saturday after the first day of competition in 
the American Junior Golf Assn.'s Canon Cup at the Lake Nona Golf Club in 
Orlando Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The event matches 20 of the top junior girls and boys from the West against 20 
from the East. Saturday's competition consisted of four-ball matches with boys' 
and girls' teams in the morning and mixed teams in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger Woods of Cypress and Kellee Booth of Coto de Caza played for the West 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Woods and teammate Brian Bateman of Monroe, La., halved in their match with 
Stewart Cink of Florence, Ala., and Chris Couch of North Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: INTERNATIONAL FUNDS GAIN APPEAL AS DOLLAR DIPS 
</P>

<P>
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait did more than shatter the Mideast peace. It also 
undermined support for the dollar -- a potentially favorable factor for 
investors in international mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, most foreign stock markets have tumbled along with the Dow Jones 
industrial index and Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index in recent weeks. However, 
the weakening U.S. currency has helped cushion the blow in many cases. From the 
standpoint of American investors, a declining dollar helps boost the value of 
holdings denominated in other currencies, while a rising greenback hurts. 
</P>
<P>
In the fixed-income market, the currency benefit has been more apparent. 
International bond funds, unlike many of their domestic counterparts, have 
gained ground lately, with much of the increase attributable to exchange rate 
fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar lost value from 1985 through 1987 -- a good period for international 
funds. That downward trend resumed earlier this year and accelerated when the 
Persian Gulf crisis broke out, raising the likelihood of a U.S. recession, 
heightened domestic inflation or both. Within the past couple of weeks, the 
dollar hit a two-year low in relation to the Swiss franc, an eight-year low 
against the British pound and a post-World War II nadir against the German 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers see further weakening ahead. Penny Dobkin, portfolio manager of 
the Fidelity Europe Fund and Fidelity Worldwide Fund, calls the current decline 
"precedent breaking" because it has occurred during a period of surging 
petroleum prices. Because oil is priced in dollars, the two normally move 
together, she explains. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of more costly petroleum and a weaker dollar could result in a 
debilitating mixture of inflation and recession on the domestic front, Dobkin 
contends. For various reasons, she predicts that the German mark will be the 
world's strongest currency during the 1990s. Her advice: Put part of your money 
in international income funds. 
</P>
<P>
James Atkinson, a senior vice president at Huntington Advisers in Pasadena, 
sees gradual downward pressure on the greenback at least over the near term. He 
believes that the dollar has lost some of its allure as a safe haven during 
troubled periods, as illustrated by its slide during the Mideast crisis. "With 
the rise of some of the other economies of the world, the dollar isn't as 
important a currency as it was 15 years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Advisers offers three International Cash Portfolios, which are 
essentially foreign money market funds that fluctuate in price due to currency 
swings. The three funds have posted gains in the 9% to 15% range so far this 
year, helped by the dollar's fall after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Fidelity also has 
three funds that are basically money market portfolios denominated in foreign 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dollar's recent weakening, many experts feel you shouldn't focus on 
currency fluctuations when considering international investments. "We really 
don't consider the foreign exchange risk," says Charles Brandes, president of 
Brandes Investment Management in San Diego. "We feel the effects are usually 
short-term, and we're not short-term investors." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Brandes, who manages accounts for institutions and individuals with at 
least $100,000 to invest, buys foreign stocks because they often offer better 
opportunities. "We invest where the values are cheapest," he says. Currently, 
Brandes considers stocks to be relatively inexpensive in the Netherlands, Hong 
Kong, Britain and even Chile, which he describes as the fastest-growing, most 
capitalistic nation of South America. 
</P>
<P>
Brandes recommends that mutual fund investors consider closed-end "country 
funds" when they sell at discounts of 20% or more to their net asset values 
(the per-share worth of the stocks or bonds held). In recent weeks, several 
such funds have declined and their discounts have widened, offering the 
opportunity to hunt for bargains, Brandes says. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Dent, co-editor of Cappiello's Closed-End Fund Digest in Santa Barbara, 
agrees. "During the present emotional frenzy, (the funds') prices have dropped 
dramatically in relation to the net asset values." 
</P>
<P>
His choices include the First Australia Fund, which traded at a 24% discount as 
of Aug. 26, the Growth Fund of Spain (21% discount), the Indonesia Fund (11% 
discount), the Latin American Investment Fund (22% discount) and the Swiss 
Helvetia Fund (13% discount). 
</P>
<P>
Sonja Kohn, president of Eurovaleur Inc., suggests that investors look past the 
current troubles and focus instead on the long-term potential of many foreign 
markets. Her New York-based money management firm concentrates on buying 
European stocks for institutional investors. Kohn hopes to capitalize on two 
dominant themes: the decline of communism in Eastern Europe and the economic 
unification of Western Europe in 1992. "The region has a fundamentally strong 
economy, and many companies have enormous hidden values," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Kohn believes that common stocks, not bonds or money market instruments, are 
the places to be for internationally oriented investors. Bonds yield higher 
nominal interest rates in places such as Britain, Australia, Sweden and Italy 
than in the United States. But after-inflation returns aren't always so 
impressive. "Even where there is a small cushion in interest rates, it's not 
always enough to compensate for currency-related risks," she says. 
</P>
<P>
It's probable that at least some foreign stock markets will recover much better 
from the current slump than domestic equities. For three weeks following the 
Iraqi invasion, markets around the globe dropped indiscriminately, says Dobkin. 
"Yet the biggest economic problems will be in the United States," she predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Even in good years, the Dow Jones industrial index or the S&amp;P 500 hardly 
ever wind up at the top of the global equity standings. There's nearly always 
at least one or more markets somewhere else doing better. That by itself is a 
compelling reason to diversify across borders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OASIS OF STABILITY 
</P>
<P>
The recent Mideast turmoil has hurt stock prices and the U.S. dollar. Whenever 
the greenback loses ground, investments denominated in other currencies tend to 
rise. This explains why mutual funds that hold foreign bonds and money market 
instruments are showing good gains this year, as the following chart 
illustrates. 
</P>
<P>
Note that when the dollar falls sharply, as in 1987, the funds post higher 
total returns. A strong dollar tends to hurt performance, as in 1988 and 1989. 
The funds listed are among the leaders in the world-income category over the 
past three years.

RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: PETER FALK'S PRIZE-WINNING TOMATOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN FANTAZIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to imagine Peter Falk on TV without that rumpled raincoat and nasty 
old cigar. But he did have a prime time on television long before "Columbo." 
</P>
<P>
His first Emmy-winning work-for "Price of Tomatoes," a 1962 episode of the 
anthology series The Dick Powell Show-can be seen Saturday at 3 p.m. on KDOC. 
</P>
<P>
Falk plays Aristide Fresco, a partner in his father's produce firm and the 
opposite of the thoughtful, slow-talking Lt. Columbo. Fresco talks-or 
yells-first and thinks later. 
</P>
<P>
And he's got a lot to think about-a truckload of Mexican tomatoes that will 
make him thousands of dollars if he can get them to Cincinnati and beat the 
competition. He's got a good head start in Texas, until he gives a lift to a 
pregnant Romanian (Inger Stevens) who's illegally in the United States but 
determined that her baby be born in America. 
</P>
<P>
Also up for the Emmy that Falk won were Lee Marvin, for a role in an "Alcoa 
Premiere," and Mickey Rooney and Milton Berle, who starred in their own 
episodes of "The Dick Powell Show." Stevens was nominated for a best-actress 
Emmy for her performance. "The Dick Powell Show" is one of the few dramatic 
anthologies from yesteryear that still plays on television. In the '50s and 
early '60s, you could watch at least one almost every night. 
</P>

LOOK FOR THE UNION LABEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE SALTZMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Workers of the world -- at least those who own a VCR -- unite. Celebrate Labor 
Day this year with an appropriate home video. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of films touch on the life and times of the American labor movement. A 
good place to start is with two dynamic portrayals of two hard-working stiffs 
as different as night and day:Marlon Brando's poor waterfront roustabout and 
Sally Field's poor Southern textile worker. 
</P>
<P>
"On the Waterfront" (1954, 108 minutes, "CA/Columbia Pictures tape and laser 
video disc)is Budd Schulberg's brutally raw account of New York harbor unions. 
</P>
<P>
This Academy Award-winning film (eight Oscars including best picture) boasts 
one of the mostimpressive casts ever assembled for a motion picture: the 
unforgettable Marlon Brando as theaverage Joe who finally takes on a corrupt 
labor boss (Lee J. Cobb in one of his nastiestportrayals); Rod Steiger as 
Brando's brother (to whom ex-boxer Brando moans in one of thefilm's most 
lampooned scenes, 'Charlie, oh Charlie, you don't understand. I coulda had 
class.I coulda been a contenduh'); Eva Marie Saint as his innocent girlfriend, 
and Karl Malden as thefrustrated priest. They were directed by Elia Kazan in 
his prime, with powerful music byLeonard Bernstein and stunning black-and-white 
cinematography by Boris Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
"Norma Rae" (1979, 113 minutes, CBS/Fox Home Video tape and laser video disc) 
makes viewers want to stand up and shout for workers' rights. Ron Leibman 
offers a realistic portrait of a labor organizer who cares more about the cause 
than the people in that cause, who recruits Sally Field and shepherds her into 
the fight against management. 
</P>
<P>
Field offers a sympathetic portrait of a woman fighting for what she believes 
is right against almost impossible odds, both in the factory and at home. 
</P>
<P>
This Martin Ritt film and the Kazan film are perfect for the small screen 
because they focus on relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"Blue Collar" (1978, 114 minutes, MCA tape and laser video disc) is a blunt 
look at assembly-line worker oppression. Integrated into a melodrama involving 
three car factory workers who finally resort to robbery, "Blue Collar" is a 
gutsy look at union and management, each ripping off the worker who is caught 
in the middle. Paul Schrader overdirected this ripe melodrama. Richard Pryor, 
Harvey Keitel and Yaphet Kotto offer first-rate performances. 
</P>
<P>
"F.I.S.TS (1978, l45 minutes, CBS-Fox tape and laser video disc) is Norman 
Jewison's well-intentioned, well-produced story of the rise and fall of a union 
boss. But this ambitious portrait of a Jimmy Hoffa-like labor leader isn't 
helped much by Sylvester Stallone's one-dimensional performance. Peter Boyle 
shows what the film could have been as a Teamster boss. 
</P>
<P>
"Black Fury" (1935, 92 minutes, Key Video tape) is a dated yet still effective 
picture about strikes, with Paul Muni as a coal miner who champions safe 
working conditions as he goes up against union corruption. 
</P>
<P>
If all of this is too serious for you on a day of rest, then try the lighter 
side of the working class. "9 to 5" (1980, llO minutes, CBS-Fox tape and laser 
video disc) is the working woman's revenge on an insufferably pompous male 
boss. Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda are the three office women who 
plot to get rid of Dabney Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pajama Game" (1964, 85 minutes, Warner tape and laser video disc) is the 
1957 Broadway musical screen version of workers in a pajama factory who demand 
a pay raise. Doris Day and John Raitt are symbols of labor and management and 
their love-hate relationship seems appropriate. The songs make the film 
memorable, including "Hey, There," and "Steam Heat." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm All Right, Jack" (1960, 104 minutes, British, HBO tape) is the classic 
1959 British satire on labor-management relations in England. Peter Sellers' 
labor leader will be a familiar figure to anyone working on either side of the 
Atlantic. The cast is in top form: Terry-Thomas, Richard Attenborough and 
Margaret Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
Two more films, each more than a half-century old, are so funny they just might 
remind you that things may not have changed that much after all. Rene Clair's 
1931 "A Nous la Liberte" (87 minutes, Hollywood Home Theater tape) is a classic 
satire on the machine age. It was one of the inspirations for Charlie Chaplin's 
"Modern Times" (1936, 89 minutes, Playhouse tape and disc) in which an assembly 
line worker goes berserk. Chaplin's last silent film (with music and sound 
effects added), it is an attack on the machine age many workers still will 
appreciate.

At least 20 passengers were missing after a bus slid off a highway bridge into 
a river about 35 miles southeast of Seoul. Four people managed to escape 
through windows after the bus plunged about 60 feet into the river near Yochon, 
according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. The accident occurred when 
the bus tried to maneuver around a car parked in the middle of the bridge.

In 1986 skipper Lee Stanley took seven inmates from Camp David Gonzales, the 
toughest youth camp in California, on a 10-day cruise -- it took him four years 
to get the permission to do so -- and then filmed it. The impact of the 
excursion on these troubled young men is deeply moving; even more so is the 
prologue, in which we find out how they are doing a year later. 
Thought-provoking material.

Gillian Armstrong's intense and rich 1987 Australian film continually plays 
against expectations of sentimental cliches or programmed heart-tugging as it 
tells of the painfully awakened bond between a teen-age daughter (Claudia 
Karvin) and the mother (Judy Davis, in a genuinely great performance as a 
wasted, reckless, lyrically drunken misfit) who abandoned her years before for 
a life on the road.

Amran Nowak's illuminating and imaginative 1986 ocumentary (airing as part of 
"American Masters") offers a warm portrait of Nobel Prize-winning writer Isaac 
Bashevis Singer and his times, drawn largely from his own words as Singer goes 
about his daily routines. Best of all is an excursion to Coney Island, where 
Singer lived upon coming to America from Warsaw in 1935.

One of the most unjustly neglected movies of the '70s, this Arthur Penn film is 
a stunning, stylish detective mystery in the classic Raymond Chandler/Ross 
Macdonald mold. The investigation of a murder by a tough yet vulnerable private 
eye (Gene Hackman) becomes a quest for his own identity and a pursuit for truth 
that cuts through many layers of social strata and ends with a wry sense of 
irony over the eternal treachery of human nature and one's own illusions. With 
Jennifer Warren, Susan Clark and Melanie Griffith.

<P>
CELEBRITIES LEND A VOICE, HAND OR NAME TO FALL'S NEW CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A year ago DIC Enterprises-a major producer of children's programming- ran an 
ad in the Hollywood Reporter headlined "Open Letter to the Acting Community." 
DIC and the Turner Broadcasting System were looking for major celebrities to do 
the voices and live-action tags for Ted Turner's new animated environmental 
action-adventure series, "Captain Planet and the Planeteers." 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of an open invitation," said co-creator and co-executive producer 
Barbara Y.E. Pyle, vice president of environmental policy at TBS SuperStation. 
"The first person to pop out was Tom Cruise." 
</P>
<P>
But when Cruise's "Days of Thunder" schedule conflicted with "Captain Planet," 
the actor popped out. But other performers-including Sting, Whoopi Goldberg, 
Meg Ryan, Tim Curry, Ed Asner, Dean Stockwell and James Coburn-found the time 
to commit to the series, which premieres Sept. 15 on KTTV at 10 a.m. and Sept. 
16 on TBS at 5:35 a.m. and 2:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Captain Planet" isn't the only star-studded fall series geared for the 2- to 
11-year-old crowd. Steven Spielberg, Roseanne Barr, Robert Klein, Howie Mandel, 
New Kids on the Block, George Carlin and Rick Moranis are just a few of the 
many personalities working on new children's programming. 
</P>
<P>
John Ratzenberger, mailman Cliff on "Cheers," is the voice of polluter Rigger 
on "Captain Planet." He answered the ad the day it ran. "I started being an 
environmentalist in 1967," he said. "I lived in Connecticut and wrote an angry 
letter to my congressman about pollution and wondered why I couldn't swim in 
the same river my father and grandfather had." Ratzenberger has seen the first 
two episodes of the series. "My son just loves 'Captain Planet,' " he said. "He 
doesn't know I am in it; he's only 3. But he's really interested in it." 
</P>
<P>
"The show is remarkable because it does challenge children," said LeVar Burton, 
whose voice is Kwame, one of the Planeteers. "The children are going to be 
responsible for the environment."

Whoopi Goldberg is the voice of Gaia-Mother Earth. "It's important to me that 
children are given interesting information in an entertaining fashion," she 
said. "I want kids to know that they can make a difference-regardless of race, 
creed or color." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg also is set to do two specials for cable's Nickelodeon. The first, 
"Hot Rod Brown, Class Clown," airs in November. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a big fan of Nickelodeon's programming," she said. "They've given me three 
'Kid's Choice' awards, which means a lot because it comes from kids." 
</P>
<P>
"Whoopi wanted to meet us," said Geoffrey Darby, senior vice president of 
programming for Nickelodeon. "She likes what we do on the air. Her idea is 
develop (the specials) into 'Tales from the Whoop' and introduce them." David 
Lynch's Propaganda Films also has found a home at Nick. Last month Nick aired 
its "Salute Your Shorts," a live-action comedy special set in a summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the people at Nickelodeon) are very much on the edge," said Matt Loze, 
executive producer at Propaganda. "They are willing to take chances." 
</P>
<P>
Shelley Duvall, who produced Showtime's "Faerie Tale Theatre," is producing 
three specials for Nick called "Stories from Growing Up." Celebrities will take 
part in a re-enactment of a special moment in their lives. For example, 
Roseanne Barr's first date; Billy Crystal's bar mitzvah. . The first is set to 
air in October. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do children's programming the entire family can enjoy," said Duvall. 
"Programming that doesn't condescend." 
</P>
<P>
Barr created ABC's "Little Rosey," premiering Saturday at 11 a.m., which 
chronicles the adventures of a 10-year-old Roseanne Barr, she said, because a 
lot of her fans are kids. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it for them," she said. "I love animation still. It's the most 
compelling thing to watch. Being a mom, I wanted to do a show about 
imagination." Though Barr is overseeing the scripts, she is not doing the voice 
of Rosey. 
</P>
<P>
"She came to us sometime last October," said Jennie Trias, vice president of 
children's programming at ABC Entertainment. "We were happy with the concept." 
Carol Rosen, director of original programming at HBO, approached comedian 
Robert Klein to kick off its new series "HBO Storybook Musicals," premiering 
Sept. 10 at 7 p.m. He adapted, narrates and sings the classic "Mike Mulligan 
and His Steam Shovel." 
</P>
<P>
"He is a wonderful storyteller and a lovely singer," said Rosen. "(He) has a 
young boy, and I asked him if he would like to see this book made into a 
program for children." 
</P>
<P>
"I loved the idea," said Klein. "I read the book to my son. I adapted it along 
with animator (and producer) Michael Sporn. I think having a child makes me 
more interested in doing this kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Loesch, president of Fox children's programming, gave the green light 
to "Bobby's World," an animated series based on "Baby Bobby," a 4-year-old 
character in comic Howie Mandel's act. The series, which premieres Saturday at 
7 a.m., will look at the world through little Bobby's eyes. "He's a very 
talented guy and has this vision," said Loesch of Mandel. 
</P>
<P>
"I will do the voice of Bobby and will play his father in live-action," said 
Mandel, who did voices for "The Muppet Babies" and "Gremlins." "My two kids can 
be with dad (on Saturday mornings) and I don't even have to get up (to watch TV 
with them)." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Spielberg is the mastermind behind Warner Bros.' new weekday syndicated 
cartoon series "Tiny Toon Adventures," premiering the week of Sept. 17 on KTTV. 
"We wanted to create a new group of characters that reflected the essence of 
the old Warners characters," said Jean MacCurdy, general vice president and 
general manager of Warner Bros. animation. 
</P>
<P>
Spielberg isn't just lending his name to the project. He is extremely involved 
in his role as executive producer. "Steven has been reading all the scripts and 
going to the storyboard meetings and has looked at all the rough cuts" 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities are being used for children's shows because of the competition for 
their attention: regular TV, cable, home video and video games. 
</P>
<P>
"(Those media are) taking an audience already shrinking and dividing it up in a 
number of different ways," said Phyllis Tucker Vinson, vice president of 
children and family programming for NBC. "We go to (celebrities) and convince 
them to get involved. Rick Moranis (whose voice and image appear in "Rick 
Moranis in Gravedale High") is a good example. He has proven to be popular with 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
Familiar movie titles also help lure young viewers. CBS is adding the animated 
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," premiering Sept. 15 at 8 a.m., to its lineup, 
as well as an animated version of the 1989 hit film "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent 
Adventure," beginning Sept. 15 at 10 a.m. Fox has animated the cult film 
"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," which kicks off Saturday at 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Price, vice president of children's programs and daytime specials at CBS 
Entertainment, said she insisted to the producers that Keanu Reeves, Alex 
Winter and George Carlin reprise their roles in "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent 
Adventures." 
</P>
<P>
"They bring a whole degree of credibility to the project," she said. Fox also 
called on John Astin to repeat his movie role of the evil Dr. Gangrene in 
"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes." 
</P>
<P>
"Many years ago in New York, I did voices and cartoons," he said. "As my career 
developed I sort of dropped that part of my work. I kind of re-oiled those 
gears to do the voice. I am having a great time."

HUSSEIN PROVES A MASTER OF THE ART OF MANIPULATION; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: HE MANAGES TO RIVET WORLD ATTENTION ON THE FATE OF HOSTAGES -- AND 
AWAY FROM THE TAKEOVER OF KUWAIT.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Iraqi President Saddam Hussein masterfully mobilized the international 
media and riveted world attention on the fate of foreign hostages in Iraq last 
week, behind the scenes he was quietly strengthening his hand. 
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, where the Persian Gulf crisis began a month ago, he consolidated his 
assets, intensifying what diplomats describe as a large-scale colonization 
campaign to settle Iraqis in the opulent villas of Kuwait city that were 
abandoned by their fleeing occupants. And he maintained his siege of the nearly 
30 embassies surviving without electricity, running water or sufficient medical 
care since defying his order to close down. 
</P>
<P>
At home, the Iraqi president stepped up war preparations nationwide, calling up 
tens of thousands more civilians for the regular army, hastening training of 
the 1-million-strong civilian Popular Army and enforcing strict new rationing 
of flour, rice, sugar and other vital commodities cut off by an international 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the shape of Saddam Hussein's evolving battle plan in what has now 
become a war of nerves between himself and the world powers ranged around him 
-- a war of propaganda, perception and perseverance, staged against the 
backdrop of a military stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a high-stakes poker game now," one senior diplomat in Baghdad said. "The 
only question is, how good is Saddam Hussein's hand? 
</P>
<P>
"He's got Kuwait. He's got the hostages. And he's got an iron grip on his 
people. That's a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"But on the other side, you've got the largest international military force 
assembled since the Second World War," he continued. "Now it's all a question 
of how Saddam plays the hand he has. And he's got a better poker face than 
almost anyone else around." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, in many of his moves last week, there were clues to the strategy 
of the enigmatic Iraqi ruler. And those indicators, along with interviews by 
The Times with key Iraqi aides and independent Middle East experts in Baghdad, 
provide an increasingly clear picture of Saddam Hussein's short-term plan. 
</P>
<P>
It is a strategy that combines international intimidation and pressure politics 
with an intensive public relations campaign aimed at audiences both at home and 
abroad. And at the heart of it all is the desire to avert military 
confrontation and divert world attention from Kuwait while he consolidates 
Iraqi rule there. 
</P>
<P>
"On the diplomatic front, Iraq tries to get to the public opinion in America 
and push the public opinion into turning against George Bush," Naji Hadithi, a 
key media adviser to Hussein, said during a frank interview Friday in outlining 
Iraq's strategy in the present crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq also keeps the nationals of countries allied with America (as hostages) 
to put pressure on them so eventually their governments will try to persuade 
George Bush to pull his forces out of the region," Hadithi added. 
</P>
<P>
But above all, he said, "Iraq tries to avoid war and seek ways to peace" -- and 
for good reason, according to many Western analysts in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing Iraq can afford right now is an actual war," one senior Western 
diplomat said. "They're still recovering from their brutal eight-year war with 
Iran, and even Saddam Hussein knows that the military force assembled all 
around him can wipe his nation off the face of the earth. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to their strategy is to stall. Time is on their side. And, in the 
meantime, (they) try to shift the focus away from Kuwait and onto the hostages 
and try to build up public support, particularly within the Arab world." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the propaganda war was the most visible part of Hussein's strategy last 
week, an image-building campaign so sophisticated that one diplomat in Baghdad 
said it rivaled the work of a top Madison Avenue ad agency. 
</P>
<P>
By deciding to open the doors of his nation to more than 300 foreign 
journalists, the man President Bush has likened to Adolf Hitler was shown on 
prime-time American TV announcing that he would release hundreds of foreign 
women and children. He has been pictured with former presidential candidate 
Jesse Jackson, CBS anchorman Dan Rather and hostage Rachel Blears, the cherubic 
6-year-old British girl who has said on camera, "He doesn't want war. I know 
because I was there." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign, even by the Iraqis' own admission, is a transparent one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important to us that a positive image about us and about the 
president be understood by the people of the world," Latif Jasim, Hussein's 
minister of information and culture, told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, Jasim's ministry deliberately concentrated on television, approving 
visas for dozens of TV crews while initially denying them to most newspapers 
and wire services. The visual medium was considered far more powerful and 
infinitely easier to control. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every image the world saw of Iraq on television last week, for 
example, was transmitted from a single satellite feed point, where an official 
censor worked overtime blacking out or simply unplugging any pictures that cast 
Hussein or the country in a negative light. 
</P>
<P>
Videotape of the scores of bread lines that form throughout the city each day 
was banned. So were interviews with diplomats or anyone speaking out against 
Hussein or his nation. And interviews with foreign hostages who hinted at 
criticism of the Iraqi government 
</P>
<P>
during an official meeting with the media were eliminated from every network 
that tried to transmit them. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage meeting was a stark illustration of how tightly Iraq guarded and 
steered its image throughout the weeklong propaganda onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
The more than 100 journalists who covered the event waited nearly six hours 
while the Information Ministry sought permission from the army. Then they were 
herded through the military cordon surrounding Baghdad's Mansour Melia Hotel, 
where the women and children were confined to their floors between meals and 
exercise hours. Finally, they were turned loose in a frenzy of interviews with 
about 50 of the hostages who agreed to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"You can ask whatever you like, write whatever you like, shoot whatever you 
like," an Information Ministry guide announced to the media mob just before the 
session began. But a few minutes later, he added, "You are going to meet women 
and children only. Any shooting of a man will be censored." 
</P>
<P>
As a further illustration of Iraq's attempt to shape international 
image-makers, Hussein himself agreed to be interviewed by Rather and Jackson -- 
on the condition that the interviews not be edited in any way before they were 
aired. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back over the weeklong media blitz, the senior Western diplomat in 
Baghdad concluded that the Iraqi president had won the first round of the 
propaganda battle. 
</P>
<P>
"He succeeded in diverting all attention away from Kuwait, which is the only 
real issue in the whole affair,," the diplomat said. "It was really quite 
brilliant when you think about it. And it is certainly a key factor in his 
present strategy." 
</P>
<P>
But the diplomat, who has been posted in the Middle East for many years, added 
that he believes Hussein's sudden announcement that he would release the 
foreign women and children -- finally carried out Saturday -- was not simply a 
publicity stunt. It was, he said, also an illustration of a distinct trait in 
the Iraqi mind. 
</P>
<P>
"People should not distinguish too much between the way Saddam Hussein does 
things and the way the Iraqis in general do things," he said. "They often come 
on very strong, stand their ground for several weeks and then back down just a 
bit as a demonstration of their kindness. It keeps their enemies guessing." 
</P>
<P>
As an illustration, he cited a Revolutionary Command Council edict, approved 
earlier this year, permitting Iraqi men to legally murder their wives if they 
are caught in adulterous situations. The new regulation reportedly came in 
response to complaints from the thousands of Iraqi troops who came back from 
the Iranian front after the war to find their wives had been unfaithful. 
</P>
<P>
The edict touched off a predictable wave of protest from women and religious 
leaders, and, three weeks later, it was dropped in a move cast as a 
humanitarian gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"If nothing else," the Western diplomat concluded, "Saddam Hussein is a man who 
understands his people -- and he knows how to control them in almost every 
conceivable way." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, Hussein's domestic campaign blitz last week was even 
more intensive than his international one. 
</P>
<P>
His every contact with the outside world and every word of every speech was 
broadcast and published again and again in Iraq's state-monopoly media. New 
portraits and statues of Hussein appeared throughout Baghdad, adding to the 
thousands already there. And, at every opportunity, the Iraqi leader cast the 
crisis as a critical test of Iraqi nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
"We are Iraqis, and we are being blockaded by superpowers," Hadithi, who edits 
the English-language national daily, said in paraphrasing the president's 
principal theme for his home audience. "That's a source of Iraqi pride, to 
stand up to this challenge from far more powerful nations that looked down on 
the Iraqi as inferior for so long." 
</P>
<P>
And Hadithi insisted that the campaign is working, despite the economic 
hardships already taking hold on the Iraqi people. 
</P>
<P>
"We have our own oil, and Iraqis can be content if Saddam Hussein tells them, 
'Eat bread and dates alone, and be content.' They won't complain, and they 
won't grumble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although a few Iraqis interviewed by The Times did complain and grumble, 
conceding in hushed tones that they have had to endure days without even bread, 
all did so in the context of their ability to survive the hardship -- and their 
admiration for their leader, whom they see as holding the fate of the world in 
his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein is a great leader of Iraqi people," one Iraqi professional, who 
asked not to be further identified, said when asked his opinion of the 
president. "You just look around. He is everywhere. He knows everything. He is 
very strong. He got Kuwait back for us, and now even George Bush is afraid of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I know all these things," he said. "All Iraqis know these things. Just watch 
the television, and you will see."

JOSINE IANCO-STARRELS WORKS TO GIVE A UNIFIED VISION TO THE VISUAL ARTS OF L.A. 
FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1990 Los Angeles Festival is barely under way and already the word on the 
street is that its visual arts component was something of an afterthought and a 
stepchild, scattered and underfunded, even though curated by the respected 
Josine Ianco-Starrels. 
</P>
<P>
Noted Los Angeles dealer Rosumund Felsen commented: "I got this ridiculous, 
illegible (festival)) brochure in the mail and assumed it was all about the 
performing arts. I don't like the idea of the (visual) arts stuck in there as a 
token kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Artist Peter Alexander praised the performing arts aspect of the festival while 
regretting the fate of the visual arts. "It's an incredible idea to tap all the 
ignored resources that exist here, but why include the visual arts in a minor 
way as a gesture? There are too many shows out there anyway." 
</P>
<P>
None of the criticism was directed to Ianco-Starrels, who has spent a 
quarter-century concentrating on Southland art. County Museum of Art senior 
curator Maurice Tuchman said, "Josine is a professional. If she is involved the 
results will be of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Ianco-Starrels thinks the visual arts are worth including, even in a secondary 
way, "because they exist. I admire (festival director) Peter Sellars and the 
spirit of the theater people. He said, 'We're not out for success because we 
know what that looks like. It looks like Burger King. We're going to do this 
this way because it needs to be done, not because it's going to be perfect.' 
Those are my sentiments exactly." 
</P>
<P>
Festival executive director Judith Luther responded to critics by pointing out 
that the festival has had a full-time arts coordinator from the beginning in 
Mary Hamilton, and that the visual arts kitty rose to some 4% of the total $5 
million budget -- from an initial $50,000 to about $200,000 -- as the general 
budget increased. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope in future years we can do more." Luther said. "Los Angeles has been too 
long perceived as a place just for the performing arts. We want to do more to 
assert the importance of the (visual) arts and literature here." 
</P>
<P>
The festival picked an appropriate booster in Ianco-Starrels, whose career 
started at the long-defunct Lytton Center for the Visual Arts in 1961. She 
moved on to teach and run the Gallery at Cal State L.A. and then the Municipal 
Art Gallery in Barnsdall Park. She recently resigned as chief curator of the 
Long Beach Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
She specialized in art and artists of the overlooked and undervalued sort, from 
ignored avant-gardists to black women and puppet collectors. Now, she is at it 
again as an independent curator jiggering together an ethnic hors d'oeuvre tray 
of festival exhibitions centered on the Pacific Rim. A couple of dozen shows on 
the official list include nine devoted to Asian and Asian-American art, six to 
the Latino sensibility, two to Afro-Americans, two to L.A. artists and one each 
to women, AIDS victims and artists from Seattle and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Ianco-Starrels lives in a rustic house tucked away on one of the myriad lanes 
that wind off Laurel Canyon Boulevard. She looks a trifle care-worn and admits 
to nervousness about talking to the press even though she compiled The Times' 
art news column for a number of years. She then goes on to make a 
characteristically enthusiastic case for the shows. 
</P>
<P>
"Judith Luther called last November and asked me to work as a consultant. I 
tried to find galleries that would be empty at the time of the festival and 
came up with places like the Woman's Building, Angel's Gate Cultural Center and 
the Long Beach Art Assn. Almost none of them have any money. Then I asked 
artists about their plans and tried to match them to galleries. Some festival 
exhibitions are shows that were already planned that happen to fit the 
festival's theme such as UCLA's Latino show, 'CARA.' 
</P>
<P>
"Our part of the festival isn't confined to traditional gallery shows. Every 
RTD car and Blue Line trolley will show parts of a series of bus cards by 13 
artists. The Patrick Media billboard company offered three big outdoor boards, 
(which) will carry works by John Baldessari, Sandra Rowe and Erica Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"The most expensive single project was $20,000 to outfit two large trucks as 
galleries that will visit public school yards during their after-school 
programs. We picked schools with the lowest testing scores because they have 
absolutely no enrichment programs. 
</P>
<P>
"This festival shines a different spotlight. It's not on the area of high art 
but on different systems people invented to make sense out of life. It's about 
getting back to manifestations of art in the lives of everyday people -- what 
UCLA calls 'cultural history.' 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a world that no longer recognizes only fine art as represented by 
the world's museums. Museums are now associated with what's being called the 
'elitist' issue of quality. But everyone knows there are second-rate talents by 
the thousands among both educated and grass-roots artists. Real talent will 
shine through in both areas. African art used to be regarded as a curiosity. 
But by the time the Museum of Modern Art did its 'Primitivism and 20th-Century 
Art' exhibition, the show was a back-door admission that the tribal arts had 
contributed a blood transfusion to late 19th-Century European art that it badly 
needed. I think it's time to pay some of that back." 
</P>
<P>
Ianco-Starrels' credentials as one of art's great populists are impeccable. At 
Lytton in 1967, she started showing unknown artists. Her ongoing series of 
"Newcomers" exhibitions gave an opening wedge to artists as disparate as Barry 
Le Va and Donald Lagerberg, Peter Alexander and Jon Swihart. In 1968, she 
organized the first exhibition of art by women in California, including works 
by Betye Saar, Helen Lundeberg, Joyce Treiman, Vija Celmins and others. When 
Lytton folded in 1969, collector Joseph H. Hirshhorn offered Ianco-Starrels a 
job at his glossy new museum under construction in Washington. She opted for an 
offer to teach and direct the gallery at Cal State L.A., not wanting to uproot 
her two young children. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tended to avoid worldly success," she says. "The tactic helps preserve 
privacy and allows you to do your own thing." 
</P>
<P>
She looked at CSLA's ethnically mixed student body and decided it was her 
audience. In 1970, she organized "Four Chicano Artists," another first. She 
happily schlepped art in her station wagon to eke enough from the budget to 
print modest catalogues. The art world only gives credence to shows with 
catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
At the Muni -- her longest and happiest gig -- she did a staggering 16 
exhibitions annually including the 1979 "Multi-Cultural Focus," intended to 
draw artists from L.A.'s minority communities. "We were getting no submissions 
whatsoever until we had the idea to appoint a racially mixed jury of 12, three 
each of black, Latino, Asian and white jurors. Artists entered once they felt 
there was someone on the jury who might be on their side." 
</P>
<P>
Given such a track record, it is no surprise Ianco-Starrels agreed to do the 
festival. What is a mystery is how, with her background, she became a populist 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
She was born in Bucharest to one of art's aristocrats, Marcel Janco, a founding 
member of the group of now-legendary artists and writers who started the 
anarchic Dada movement in Zurich in 1916. (German art historians changed the 
original spelling of his name to "Janco.") He was a successful artist, 
architect and gentleman landowner. Long before Ianco-Starrels learned English 
from Frank Sinatra records, she spoke Romanian, German and French, and read 
Latin. 
</P>
<P>
When the Nazis moved into Romania and confiscated all Jewish property, the 
Janco family was forced to flee to Palestine. Like many other Jews, they were 
beggared by the escape. 
</P>
<P>
"The visa to cross Turkey alone cost a quarter-million dollars." Ianco-Starrels 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Installed in Tel-Aviv, her admired father continued to intimidate her. "He 
would tell me I was hopelessly middle-class because I liked a beautiful 
sunset," she said, "But I couldn't stay hurt because he was so handsome. He 
gave me a taste for beautiful men." 
</P>
<P>
And beautiful men responded. The renowned photographer Robert Capa spotted 
Ianco-Starrels looking rather like a teen-aged Linda Darnell and begged her to 
run away to Paris with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to but I told him, 'No, because one afternoon you will leave the 
hotel for cigarettes and never come back. I couldn't stand that. I'm not strong 
enough.' He said, 'In that case you are right to refuse me.' " 
</P>
<P>
But she ended up in Paris eventually. As she was about to graduate from 
Tel-Aviv's Balfour College, Janco jerked her out of school. "He said that 
learning should be pursued purely, for its own sake and not for some piece of 
paper. So I never got a college degree." 
</P>
<P>
The imperious, irresistible father agreed to send his daughter to Paris 
instead. She arrived with letters to Roberto Matta, Tristan Tzara, Andre 
Breton, Jean Arp and the rest of the Paris avant-garde, but few of them had 
much time for a green girl from Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
So how did a girl bred to art's purple wind up as earth-mother to L.A.'s 
aesthetic grass roots? 
</P>
<P>
"(My father) was a populist from an elitist family. He defied them by marrying 
my mother. She was Catholic, illegitimate and poor but very beautiful." She 
holds out old photos as proof. 
</P>
<P>
"He designed ultra-modern houses but furnished them with folk art. In Israel he 
spent 40 years teaching. He founded the artists' village of Einhod. He founded 
an atelier to translate artists' paintings into tapestries. The workshop was 
run by a young Arab and women who did the embroidery. 
</P>
<P>
"He believed in public art decades before the term existed. He said the 
development of easel painting in the Renaissance robbed the people of visual 
literacy by destroying the tradition of public sculpture and frescoes and made 
art into a private pleasure of the rich and powerful." 
</P>
<P>
In 1950 Ianco-Starrels bolted for independence, moving to New York and 
enrolling at the Art Students League. She also began getting married. First 
came a chap named Harold Manson. She says his good looks were shortly 
overbalanced by his fastidious tendency to be the world's greatest gourmet on 
all subjects -- a maven. 
</P>
<P>
She divorced him and married Herbert Kline, a charismatic filmmaker 20 years 
her senior and father of her children. A classic lost-generation lefty, he made 
noted documentary films on World War II such as "Lights Out in Europe" and an 
award-winning study of the Mexican muralists, "Walls of Fire." He had fought in 
the Spanish Civil War and was blacklisted during the McCarthy era. They came to 
L.A. and in 1961 he took a job with Bart Lytton -- an old filmwriting crony who 
had gone on to become a savings-and-loan baron. 
</P>
<P>
Lytton purchased a collection of archaic pre-cinema contraptions ranging from 
shadow figures to magic lantern slides and peep shows. He opened a gallery to 
show it in the S&amp;L building he'd built on the site of the legendary Sunset 
Boulevard movie-star bungalow court, The Garden of Allah. Kline was to be his 
curator but Ianco-Starrels wound up with the job because -- incredibly -- all 
the labels and documentation for the exotic collection were in Latin. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the flashy, high-flying Lytton was involved with the new County 
Museum of Art where he had given half the money for its center building. With 
this leverage, he tried to tell the museum board it ought to show more 
California art. The board told him politely that such decisions were up to the 
professional staff. He withdrew his donation and decided to open his own art 
gallery for California art at Lytton Savings. Ianco-Starrels was named its 
curator and her career was accidentally launched. 
</P>
<P>
Lytton's intentions were better than his taste, and Ianco-Starrels had to fight 
a running battle to maintain professional artistic standards against a willful 
boss, setting a pattern that would dog her career. She was on a collision 
course with Lytton but his financial empire collapsed before it came to a head. 
Somewhere in the midst of all this, she and Kline divorced and she married 
Lytton executive Morrie Starrels. They separated in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Her CSLA job ended in 1975 when funding for the gallery dried up. "The 
president of the college suggested I just do student art shows. I suggested 
they clear the library of books and replace them with student papers. I 
resigned." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 -- during her idyllic 12-year tenure at Municipal Art Gallery -- 
Ianco-Starrels was awarded an honorary doctorate from Otis/Parsons School of 
Design. About the same time, she broke her ankle in a fall, which led to her 
departure after the city hired Fred Croton as general manager of the Cultural 
Arts Department. 
</P>
<P>
"While I was convalescing, Croton hired a new curator and I was kicked 
upstairs. I was not a good bureaucrat. I didn't kowtow to moves that were 
intended to make political hay for the gallery. When I was presented with 
slides proposing a show for the mother of an influential politician, I turned 
it down. I was not an obedient servant. Bosses don't like that." 
</P>
<P>
She left the Muni in 1987. Croton was subsequently relieved of his post, having 
been accused by Mayor Tom Bradley and others of lying about his qualifications 
when he applied for the post. Ianco-Starrels was offered her job back, but felt 
it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
She'd taken the chief curatorship at Long Beach. When the then-director, 
Stephen Garrett, resigned, she became acting director but, fearing the 
tentacles of administration, did not apply for the directorship. The museum 
appointed Harold B. Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
"We had differences in perception about the program. Since I had turned down 
the directorship, I thought it was my turn to bow out." 
</P>
<P>
Now on her own, she is working on a show of L.A. realist artists for Tokyo's 
Sezon (Seibu) Museum with fellow-independent Noriko Fujinami. There are other 
projects cooking. 
</P>
<P>
How does she feel about freewheeling? 
</P>
<P>
She smiles wryly and says, "I feel like a cavalryman without a horse."

AN OFFBEAT ADDICTION; 
</P>
<P>
PERRY FARRELL INFLAMES PASSIONS AND PLAYS FOR HIGH STAKES AS HE LEADS JANE'S 
ADDICTION IN ITS QUEST FOR IMPORTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The sound hooked Perry Farrell the moment he left the Thai restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a live band," he said, turning toward the adjoining Armenian restaurant 
in a corner mall east of Hollywood. Through the glass door, he watched as 
couples filled the dance floor to the insistent wailing of accordion, clarinet, 
drums and bass. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of thing I listen to," said Farrell, who has slipped an 
occasional Middle Eastern modality into the rock of his own band, Jane's 
Addiction. "I listen to things like this, Indian movie sound tracks. I don't 
listen to much rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
Stepping inside, the scrawny rock 'n' roller with pasted-down dreadlocks, a 
Mexican rosary around his neck and a ring through the center of his nose 
crouched at the side of the room, drawing curious glances from the middle-aged 
Armenian diners. 
</P>
<P>
But he was oblivious. For the first time all day he didn't have to think about 
the deadlines and demands that spoil the fun of being an artist. Eyes wide, 
head bobbing, a smiling Farrell escaped into a mournful, infectious sound 
forged by ancient pain and resolve. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, that's what he's after with Jane's Addiction, the Los Angeles band 
that has drawn sharp battle lines during its noisy advance to the brink of 
possible stardom. Opinion about the group doesn't tend to be neutral, and its 
recently released album "Ritual de lo Habitual" (reviewed on Page 56) figures 
to be closely watched as a put-up-or-shut-up response to the question that 
won't go away: Is Jane's Addiction a big noise with a knack for getting 
attention, or is it the real thing? 
</P>
<P>
The debate is fine with Farrell, who likes to inflame passions and play for 
high stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been my intention to do something great," the 31-year-old singer 
said earlier, over a plate of Thai duck. "I know in the back of my mind that 
yeah, people are looking at it like it could be an important band. . . . Yeah, 
I would like to be involved in an important band. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't write about current affairs or current events. I talk about things 
that have been going on since the beginning of time. . . . I would like a man a 
thousand years from now to pick up the recording the way you'd pick up 
something Aristotle wrote, and say, 'I know what he's talking about.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Doors, the Byrds and Love in the '60s. X and Black Flag in the punk '70s 
and '80s. So far in the '90s, it pretty much comes down to Jane's Addiction and 
Guns N' Roses when you're looking for the definitive Los Angeles hard-rock 
band. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of feel that we are that," said Farrell. "In my heart I know it. . . . 
There's a lot of bands like Guns N' Roses. There's not a lot of bands like us." 
</P>
<P>
True enough. 
</P>
<P>
You can drop Jane's Addiction into any number of slots -- hard rock, 
psychedelic, white funk, art rock. Wherever you put them, they're different 
from the other bands in there. Farrell's voice conveys a child's excitement and 
wonder in an old man's rasp, and his charged, restless vision is framed in a 
sound that's haunting and head-rattling, intimate and majestic, frightening and 
tender. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to get into something that was very far, far removed from 
reality, yet a person can follow it, and maybe even be scared to be there," 
Farrell said. "If anything, I think that's where our band does well. We'll take 
you places. It's not just music, it's not just putting together a song. It's 
creating something that's like theater." 
</P>
<P>
On stage, the startling metal/psychedelic attack and Farrell's over-the-top, 
shamanistic performances become a purging rite of passage, providing release 
through ritual. Farrell is a champion of good old rock 'n' roll mayhem and 
audience participation. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell likes to keep his emotions close to the surface. When he talked about 
how much he loves his girlfriend, he appeared to be on the verge of tears, but 
his mood swings kept bringing him back to complaints about "greedy men" with 
their hands in his pockets. He casts himself a champion of pure freedom, a 
challenger of limitations locked in eternal combat with the forces of 
convention. His adopted name is a play on peripheral. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell arrived in L.A. after running away from his Queens, N.Y., home at 17. 
He lived in his car at the beach before eventually drifting into the rock 
scene, and after a stint with a band called Psi-Com he enlisted bassist Eric 
Avery, guitarist Dave Navarro and drummer Stephen Perkins to form Jane's 
Addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Abrasive and provocative, erratic and unruly, the flamboyant Farrell became a 
vivid presence around town as Jane's Addiction elbowed its way out of the 
underground club scene. They released an independent live album, then signed 
with Warner Bros. after a record-company bidding war. "Nothing's Shocking," 
their 1988 major-label debut, sold 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
The group has the potential to command a unique coalition, but it wasn't just 
another case of mapping demographics or hooking into a fashion curve. This 
group's bond with its followers went deeper than that. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell can sense this solidarity, and he has a theory. 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody said, 'Hey man, let's go and talk to this guy, 'cause we've been 
ripped off,' I'm the guy who's in the front. I'm the one who'll knock on the 
guy's door and say, 'Hey man, we want our money back.' Maybe I'll take the 
first punch. Maybe that's what they get out of me." 
</P>
<P>
The key, he says, is to live what he writes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't enjoy listening to songs that I know the people didn't experience. . . 
. The way I look at it, songwriting or song making started because somebody 
stood up and had a story to tell. People would listen to it and it intrigued 
them. It meant something to that guy, therefore people felt something from it. 
</P>
<P>
"But to sit there and make up this story that comes from nowhere and it's not 
grounded with any sadness, sorrow, joy or anything, it's just a waste of time. 
. . . It's gotta be founded in something that's inspired you or hurt you or 
made you feel really happy." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell's quest for realism and free expression has led to controversy, mainly 
</P>
<P>
over his record covers -- naked Siamese twins with flaming heads on the first, 
naked fetish dolls on the new one. But he insists his intentions are pure. 
</P>
<P>
"I like giving people a rise. I'm not trying to outrage you. I'm not this 
stupid kid with a nihilistic outlook on life like I just destroy. I like 
colors. I'm drawn to colors, I'm drawn to love." 
</P>
<P>
For someone who likes to look like a walking piece of folk art, Farrell keeps a 
low profile. 
</P>
<P>
He avoids rock clubs because he doesn't like to be recognized. Instead, he 
spends time with the homeless beach dwellers near the Venice apartment he 
shares with his girlfriend, Casey Niccoli, who co-directs his film/video 
projects. Rather than ride a Harley to L.A.'s trendy nightspots, he drives 
around in his pickup truck looking through trash dumpsters. Mainly, he wants to 
make things. 
</P>
<P>
He writes the songs, oversees the arrangements, produces the records, builds 
the sculptures and other constructions for the covers. Right now he's designing 
the stage for the upcoming tour and facing 25 hours of footage for the band's 
new video/movie. 
</P>
<P>
Stimulating stuff, but the external pressures of the record business tend to 
get in the way. "If I would just be left alone it'd be so much fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But being left alone doesn't seem to be in the cards. He simply has a nose for 
conflict, and since he writes what he knows, pain has become Jane's Addiction's 
great theme. 
</P>
<P>
Bumped my head. I'm a battering ram. 
</P>
<P>
 Goddamn took the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut myself, said "So what?" 
</P>
<P>
 ... Took the pain 
</P>
<P>
 There ain't no right! Ain't no wrong now 
</P>
<P>
 Only pleasure and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Ain't No Right" 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my druthers, next life I would prefer to be on a planet where there 
was less pain and a lot more pleasure," Farrell said. "This is a very tricky 
world. It's a very exciting world because of the element of pain and danger. . 
. . I would make a very bad parent and I'm sure I'm not a good influence on 
people because I would advise people to take risks and to go out and do things 
that are dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell is resigned to his role as a lightning rod for aggression. 
</P>
<P>
"I really would just as soon do without it, but I guess you take on in this 
world what you're equipped to," he said. "So maybe I'm equipped to take on a 
lot of fights. . . . It doesn't feel good doing it. But the pain that comes 
with things can also make you a very strong spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"You know who was a hero of mine? Muhammad Ali. . . . Look what he did. In the 
'60s, in the midst of the war, he objected to joining the Army, he changed his 
name, his religion, he said, 'I'm the greatest.' 
</P>
<P>
"The man burned himself up. He made everything look so easy. Something that's 
so difficult, taking shots in the face. And every time he did, he would open 
his mouth and eyes real wide and shake his head 'No no no.' And now he can 
hardly even speak. Because he made it look so easy, but those shots really took 
their toll on him. 
</P>
<P>
"I can relate to the guy, but he also scares me, because I don't want to end up 
like him. Because I'm the kind of guy who can take shots and shake my head and 
say, 'It don't hurt, look look look,' and do my windmill with my right hand and 
punch you with my left and then move my feet real fast. 
</P>
<P>
"But the poor guy's paid for it. And I just feel sometimes people that have 
that flamboyance, they burn fast. They burn themselves up fast. It's 
unavoidable. Yeah, a lot happens in my life. Maybe I'll burn out fast, but I'm 
gonna leave behind something good. I know it."

GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ ON THE MISFORTUNES OF LATIN AEMRICA, HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH 
FIDEL CASTRO AND HIS TERROR OF THE BLANK PAGE.

IMAGINE STOCKHOLM IN DECEMBER, when it is nearly always nighttime. A 
54-year-old son of Colombia's Caribbean coast has come to collect his Nobel 
Prize for Literature. It is 1982, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez is already famous 
as the author of "One Hundred Years of Solitude," which is selling better than 
the Bible in some Spanish-speaking countries. Garcia Marquez counts powerful 
men, including Cuban President Fidel Castro, among his closest friends. And he 
has written a ringing acceptance speech in which he defines the solitary 
existence of Latin America, dares Europe to allow these countries to make their 
own mistakes and defends the "persistent advantage of life over death." 
</P>
<P>
But the Nobel ceremonies are a confusion of activity that has this native of 
the tropics shivering with cold and mixing up day and night in a place so far 
north of the Equator. He is exhausted, begging for sleep. He falls asleep. And 
then a curious thing happens. 
</P>
<P>
"I suddenly woke up in bed, and I remembered that they always give the same 
room in the same hotel to the Nobel winner," Garcia Marquez says. "And I 
thought, 'Rudyard Kipling has slept in this bed, Thomas Mann, Neruda, Asturias, 
Faulkner.' It terrified me, and finally I went out to sleep on the sofa." 
</P>
<P>
Now, sitting in the study of his Mexico City home, Garcia Marquez laughs at 
himself as he recalls that night eight years ago. Considered one of the 
greatest masters of the Spanish language since Miguel de Cervantes, he is at 
once vastly proud and humbled by the literary company into which he has been 
cast. This tale he tells captures the character of the poor boy with 14 
brothers and sisters who grew up to become a world-famous author of books, 
published in at least 32 languages. 
</P>
<P>
If that is incongruous, then his life is full of incongruity, much like the 
characters in his fiction, which he has drawn from his own experiences and 
those of his family and acquaintances. This man, called Gabo by his friends, is 
guided by reason and superstition in nearly equal parts. He believes in the 
romantic idea of inspiration but has worked assiduously to master Western 
literature and the craft of writing. He is both generous and egocentric, 
dignified and vain. A devoted advocate of human freedom, he cannot bring 
himself to criticize the suppression of intellectual liberty in Cuba. He is a 
practiced journalist, yet he is so uncomfortable at being interviewed that he 
wrings his hands and sinks into the couch 
</P>
<P>
when questioned in ways that do not suit him. 
</P>
<P>
He often has broken with convention. He did so in his 1975 novel "The Autumn of 
the Patriarch," which is a single 297-page paragraph, the longest in Spanish 
literature. And he does again in his new novel, "The General in His Labyrinth," 
which is to be published in the United States this month. The book describes 
the final, tormented days of Gen. Simon Jose Antonio de la Santisima Trinidad 
Bolivar y Palacios -- called Simon Bolivar. Garcia Marquez has stripped away 
the winding cloths from the venerated legend to reveal the Great Liberator of 
South America in all his human nakedness and contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
The book shocked Colombia when it was first published in Spanish last year. 
Garcia Marquez was accused of being anti-patriotic, of destroying national 
heritage. The author says that he has neither maligned nor belittled the 
19th-Century liberator and leader of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and 
Bolivia. He just wanted Latin Americans to see Bolivar as he truly was. 
</P>
<P>
But you should not expect to see this sort of nakedness in the author himself. 
A witty and beguiling storyteller, Garcia Marquez forthrightly tries to shape 
the history that is written about him. He weaves enchanting yarns about his 
youth and family, insisting that all of it is present in his books, 
particularly in the best-selling "Love in the Time of Cholera," the romantic 
tale of a lifelong love affair he says is based on his mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
He is writing his memoirs in sections divided by theme rather than chronology, 
a method that not only frees him from what he calls the "imprisonment" of a 
work in progress but which "allows me to skip over the themes that don't 
interest me, or that are not in my interest to write." 
</P>
<P>
The author who unmasks the General says: "I believe one has a public life, a 
private life and a secret life. I have written a lot about my public and 
private lives. On my secret life I have not written a single word." 
</P>
<P>
But what if someone invents his secret life, as Garcia Marquez did for the 
General, detailing Bolivar's women and sexual intrigues? 
</P>
<P>
"Ah," he says with a grin. "What they invent will never be as good as the 
reality that I will take to my grave." 
</P>
<P>
GARCIA MARQUEZ IS A JAUNTY,energetic man of 62 with furrowed cheeks and a lined 
brow. His mustache is white, his eyebrows black, his hair salt-and-pepper gray. 
Upright and barrel-chested, he takes full advantage of his otherwise average 
height to fill a room with his presence. As he speaks in clear and modulated 
Spanish, he smiles playfully and punctuates with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
He loves good food so much that you might think he judges a man as much by what 
he eats as by what he does. He's curious about how world figures think about 
food, and what they eat. He wants to get to know Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev "over lunch . . . and in his shirt-sleeves." He keeps a cellar filled 
with French wines, but his daily habits are fairly austere: He diets on fruit, 
quit smoking cigarettes years ago and gave up coffee "because it made me think 
of death." 
</P>
<P>
With Mercedes, his wife of 32 years, Garcia Marquez lives much of the year in a 
Spanish Colonial-style house on the southern edge of Mexico City, a favorite 
neighborhood of Mexican writers and intellectuals. What first strikes you about 
their two-story house is its whiteness. The carpets are white, the walls are 
white, much of the furniture is white. You can't help but wonder whether this 
man has dirt on his shoes like the rest of us. Or does he levitate so that he 
can live with this virginal carpet, which looks like a giant canvas awaiting 
inspiration? 
</P>
<P>
He takes pride in this house with its high brick-and-wood-beam ceilings and a 
collection of paintings by Mexican artists Rufino Tamayo and Abel Quezada, 
Nicaraguan Armando Morales and Colombian Fernando Botero. He wants to show off 
the house -- one of several dwellings he owns, in Bogota, Cartagena, Barcelona, 
Cuernavaca and Paris -- but also he wants to show his affection for journalists 
by sharing something intimate that will make for a better story. He wrote news 
before novels and always is thinking of the story. As one writer to others, he 
leads us upstairs to see his bedroom and the books beside his low, white bed. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marquez awakens at 5 a.m. every day to reach into the pile of books, 
which this day includes Kenneth S. Lynn's biography of Ernest Hemingway, a 
biography of the late Mexican President Francisco A. Madero, the Italian 
translation of "The General," Octavio Paz's new collection of essays, "A Small 
Chronicle of Great Days," a Spanish mystery novel and a copy of the 
Constitution of Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't read at night because I have gotten up early, and I fall asleep. And 
if I work at night, I will keep working in my sleep, and then I wake up tired," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Now we can picture Garcia Marquez in the dawn light made brighter by the white 
room, reading and correcting what he has written the day before, while Mercedes 
sleeps by his side. This is the only time he has without the interruptions of 
telephones, secretaries and visitors. 
</P>
<P>
He begins his day's work at 8 a.m. in the shower, imagining characters and 
inventing sentences under a steady stream of hot water. "Sometimes," he tells 
us, "the bathroom fills with steam I take so long. You can't see anything in 
the mirrors." He had to install a second hot-water heater to support his 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy on scholarship in boarding school, Garcia Marquez was taught to make 
his bed, shower in cold water and get fully dressed before breakfast. Of that, 
he has preserved only the habit of dressing for work. He cannot write in a 
bathrobe or sweat suit. On many mornings, he stands before his mirrored closets 
searching desperately for something to wear. He calls this ritual one of his 
"secret vices." 
</P>
<P>
"Many times I arrive late at my desk because I don't have anything to wear. I 
can't decide what pants to put on with what shirt. I have a closet full of 
clothes, and I scream, 'I don't have anything to wear.' Of course, all of this 
is a pretext because of the fear of going to write." 
</P>
<P>
He admits that a blank piece of paper sparks the same terror in him today that 
it did at the beginning of his career. He dallies over the newspaper, makes 
telephone calls that simply cannot wait and rejoices at an electricity blackout 
that shuts down his computer. But he must go to work. 
</P>
<P>
"If I invent an excuse not to write and I don't write, then in the afternoon I 
have a tremendous attack of conscience. I really feel guilty, as if I have not 
earned my meal." 
</P>
<P>
After breakfast, Garcia Marquez crosses his back veranda and manicured garden, 
with its rosebushes, bougainvillea and citrus trees, to an old barn that he has 
converted into a comfortable, modern study as white as the rest of the house. 
The shelved walls are filled with expensive stereo equipment, records and tapes 
of classical music, and row after row of novels in Spanish, English, French and 
Italian -- the four languages in which he reads. 
</P>
<P>
When asked which current writer he prefers, he hesitates as if in fear of 
offending any of them. Finally, he volunteers that he especially likes the work 
of two close friends, Milan Kundera and Carlos Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
On shelves above the couch he has "two yards" of the complete works of 
Hemingway and William Faulkner. He pulls two volumes of Herman Melville from 
their place: "This is the greatest American author. But most writers won't 
admit it." Edgar Allan Poe is another of his American favorites. He is reading 
the memoirs of Bertrand Russell; he admires the compactness of Russell's 
language. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never manage to write like him. First of all, he wrote in English, 
which is boom, boom, boom. I like my own books better in English than Spanish. 
They're not better written or more poetic, but they have fewer words than I can 
achieve in Spanish . . . because Spanish is such a sinuous language." 
</P>
<P>
To tighten his own writing, he has eliminated adverbs, which in Spanish all 
have the ending -mente. "Before 'Chronicle of a Death Foretold,' " he says, 
"there are many. In 'Chronicle,' I think there is one. After that, in 'Love,' 
there are none. In Spanish, the adverb -mente is a very easy solution. But when 
you want to use -mente and look for another form, it always is better. It has 
become so natural to me that I don't even notice anymore." 
</P>
<P>
At 9 o'clock, Garcia Marquez sits down at his neat wood desk. With a lifelong 
aversion to the cold, he slips into an old tan sweater with a loose button, 
and, fighting the urge to procrastinate further, he at last turns on his 
computer. He inserts the changes that he has made on paper in the early morning 
and then begins to elaborate on the ideas that have come to him in the shower. 
</P>
<P>
The computer, Garcia Marquez says, has saved him from his own perfectionist 
tendencies, which had become yet another means of stalling. When he wrote on a 
typewriter, he insisted that each page be flawless: no erasures, blotches or 
crossed-out letters. "I considered a typing mistake an error of creation," he 
says. Once, he went through an entire ream of paper typing the final manuscript 
of a 15-page short story. 
</P>
<P>
He used to write a page each day -- 250 words. "If you write several hundred 
words a day all your life, you will write as much as Balzac." But the computer 
has changed his technique slightly -- now he labors over longer sections and 
perfects them over several days. 
</P>
<P>
Although his two children have been grown and gone for more than a decade, 
Garcia Marquez stops his daily writing sharply at 2 in the afternoon, the hour 
that he used to pick them up at school and bring them home for lunch. Before 
leaving his office, he makes a printout of what he has written, which he will 
edit in bed the following morning. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marquez still occasionally writes pieces of journalism in addition to 
fiction. He tells us that he believes journalism is a literary genre, a 
rendition of reality, like the novel or the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"When I write journalism, some people think I am writing literature," he says. 
"And I am very rigorous when I write journalism, very careful of reality. But I 
have a way of selecting and seeing reality that is very literary. I use the 
same method of observation in journalism and literature. Because of literature 
I see things others don't. On the other hand, journalism has helped me in 
literature precisely because it has helped me maintain contact with reality 
always." 
</P>
<P>
In journalism, he recounts stories that most reporters only think to tell their 
friends. "For example, when I met the Pope a month after he was named, two 
things grabbed my attention. We were talking like this, face to face, and I 
felt one of the buttons fall off my blazer. I heard it fall on the floor. I 
maintained a poker face, but he saw it, leaned down and picked it up. I would 
have left it. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, when I was about to go," says this journalist who was reared Catholic, 
"he went to open the door to his study, and it was locked. He had only been 
Pope for a short time, and he couldn't get the door open. He made an 
exclamation in Polish. All I could think of at that moment was what my mother 
would say if she knew that I was locked in with the Pope and we couldn't get 
out." 
</P>
<P>
AS GARCIA MARQUEZ tells it, he did not set out to write the story of Simon 
Bolivar. He wanted rather to recount the tale of his beloved Magdalena, the 
Colombian river that he traveled so often as a youth and later used as the 
setting for "Love in the Time of Cholera." 
</P>
<P>
"I know the Magdalena River port by port, and I have a great nostalgia for that 
era. I think nostalgia is the source of all literature and poetry," he says. "I 
had thought I would write the story of the Magdalena River through Bolivar's 
trip, without worrying much about his personality. But it wasn't possible. He 
took over." 
</P>
<P>
The Great Liberator, Garcia Marquez discovered during two years of exhaustive 
research, was nothing like the one-dimensional hero presented to schoolchildren 
all across the continent. Garcia Marquez felt obliged to set history straight. 
So he wrote a novel of Bolivar's last, ambiguous journey down the Magdalena as 
a haggard and dying man, old at 47, reviled, nearly friendless, with his hopes 
of a unified and independent Latin America in tatters. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marquez's Bolivar is a romantic aristocrat, as myth would have it, but 
"The General in His Labyrinth" also says that the legendary hero is part black 
-- his is not the long Roman nose that it became in revisionist drawings. His 
language is vulgar, with a river man's coarseness that has shocked the Latin 
world of letters. Having lost his wife at a young age, Bolivar fills his nights 
not only with his well-known mistress, Manuela Sasenz, but also with countless 
young girls, whom he eagerly takes to his hammock and then discards. 
</P>
<P>
But most disconcerting for a sainted hero is the decrepit state of his body: He 
is a farting, foul-breathed insomniac who suffers periodic spells of delirium. 
This Bolivar is full of the contradictions that Garcia Marquez discovered in 
the 10,000 letters the General wrote over a lifetime. "He changed his opinion 
according to the circumstances. It was extraordinary to find that there was a 
human being in this myth that they had created." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike typical Bogota leaders, including his one-time vice president Francisco 
de Paula Santander, Bolivar was not at all cautious or formalistic. Bolivar was 
a republican who repeatedly denied that he was tempted toward a monarchy. A 
visionary gnawed by disillusionment, he wrote at the end of his life: "America 
is ungovernable, the man who serves a revolution plows the sea, this nation 
will fall inevitably into the hands of the unruly mob and then will pass into 
the hands of almost indistinguishable petty tyrants of every color and race." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, in the novel, Bolivar expects to keep on fighting for his ideals. He 
still dreams of a unified Latin America. "Bolivar has been criticized because 
he was a dictator," Garcia Marquez says, "because at one point he wanted to 
establish a monarchy. One sees very clearly that what happened with Bolivar is 
that he wanted to create a free and united country, and he didn't care how he 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
Some historians and intellectuals are angered by the book's emphasis on 
Bolivar's bitter quarrel with the other hero of Colombian independence, 
Santander. Other critics have dismissed the book as the work of a leftist 
trying to destroy democratic institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't tried to destroy anything but to show the man," Garcia Marquez says. 
"All the veneration and all the respect that he gets as a myth are greater if 
he is seen as a human being." 
</P>
<P>
THE RIVER THAT Garcia Marquez would have written about will have to wait its 
turn. He says it will receive ample attention in his memoirs. The Magdalena was 
a symbol of freedom to the young Garcia Marquez, who left home by steamboat at 
age 13 to go away to school. It is a source of inspiration to the mature writer 
who remembers the throaty whistle of the boats and their macho captains. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the small banana-growing town of Aracataca, Garcia Marquez was 8 when 
he moved with his parents to Barranquilla, at the mouth of the Magdalena. The 
story of his family is all there in "Love in the Time of Cholera," Garcia 
Marquez says. Like Fermina Diaz, his mother went to high school and studied 
piano; his father wanted to be a doctor but ran out of money before he finished 
school and, like Florentino Ariza, became a telegrapher. Later, he opened a 
small pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very poor, but worse than that, we had pretensions. My mother and 
father had 11 children, and my father had four more outside of the marriage. 
Two of those were grown and didn't live with us. When the other two were born, 
my mother reacted with the usual drama, but then she said my father's blood 
couldn't be running around out there and she brought them home. They lived with 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Growing up, Garcia Marquez spent a lot of time with his maternal grandparents 
in Aracataca. He has said that he learned a lot from his storytelling 
grandmother. And his grandfather's Caribbean-flavored Spanish helped Garcia 
Marquez reconstruct Bolivar's style of speaking. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy, he loved comic books -- Dick Tracy and Terry and the Pirates -- and 
yearned to buy them, but they were too expensive. "I realized I had to leave 
the house because another mouth was born every year. I got the idea of a 
scholarship. In 1942, Colombia was such a centralized country that in order to 
win a scholarship, I had to travel 600 miles to take an exam in Bogota. The 
trip was very expensive. I don't know where my father got the money. I knew I 
had to pass the test, because I didn't have the return fare." 
</P>
<P>
This was his first trip on the Mississippi-style steamboats, whose whistles had 
called to him as boy. He passed the test, got the scholarship and enrolled in a 
boarding school outside of Bogota. But he continued to ride the river at each 
vacation for the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful trip because we were singing and dancing, and the boat was 
full of students. I loved to ride up with the captains. I learned that they had 
lovers in every port, and when the boats arrived, the captains signaled with 
the whistles to let them know who it was. Those captains are a legend. Now it 
has become nostalgia. I was always conscious that some day I would write about 
this. I was aware that something was happening to me." 
</P>
<P>
At school, Garcia Marquez learned what he now considers a basic truth: "It may 
be dogmatic and probably reactionary, but I believe you find some people are 
born knowing how to tell a story. They have a sense of timing, of organization 
of facts. After that, it is a long way to becoming a writer. You have to learn 
to write well. It is a technical process, a process of elaboration and a 
capacity to elaborate experiences. There are many writers who are just 
technicians, and you can tell that right away." 
</P>
<P>
In the boarding school, he says, "I was probably the only one who knew how to 
tell a story. I enjoyed telling stories, and my teachers heard me." 
</P>
<P>
His teachers were political radicals from all over the country, sent into a 
kind of internal exile to the boarding school, a place where it was thought 
they could cause no trouble. They recognized Garcia Marquez's interests and let 
him do as he pleased. He read every volume in the school library in the order 
they were arranged on the shelves. "I remember there were three volumes of the 
works of Freud. I read all without knowing what I was reading, but the clinical 
cases were marvelous. Now I understand why I was so interested -- because of 
the clinical cases." 
</P>
<P>
He entered the National University in Bogota, choosing to study law because the 
morning classes allowed him to hold a job in the afternoon. "I wanted to study 
philosophy and letters, but no one would have forgiven a student as poor as I 
was for studying philosophy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he made his way through the 19th-Century Russian novelists, 17th-Century 
Spanish poets, Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. Then he discovered Franz Kafka, 
who "impressed me the most. He revealed a certain sense of literature because 
he was capable of anything." 
</P>
<P>
In Bogota, he wrote stories "that had nothing to do with my reality. It was 
someone else's reality, the reality of other writers." But he sold one to the 
local newspaper, El Espectador, and then another and another. Suddenly, he was 
a writer, without, he felt, really knowing how to write. The responsibility 
sent him into a panic. He began to study the Greek and Latin classics, and 
then, "something providential happened." 
</P>
<P>
On April 9, 1948, liberal political leader Jorge Eliecer Gaitan was 
assassinated. The city erupted in three days of riots that became known as el 
Bogotazo and resulted in years of political violence. Like most university 
students, Garcia Marquez went into the streets to break windows in protest. 
When he returned to his pension he found it in ashes. The university shut down. 
Nothing remained for him in Bogota, so he left for the Caribbean coast where he 
knew he could find a newspaper job. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got to Cartagena, I rediscovered in the coast a reality and culture 
with which I completely identified," he says. He never fails to identify 
himself as a Caribbean. In his books and conversation, Bogota, sitting on the 
high plains of central Colombia, is cold, formal and austere; the Caribbean and 
its people are hot-blooded and exuberant. 
</P>
<P>
When he moved to the coast, his literary friends told him that the classics 
were fine but that the most exciting writers alive were the novelists from the 
Southern United States. He began to read them, and his great love for 
Faulkner's work was born. "I discovered that he was writing about a world 
exactly like the one I had lived," he says. It was a world of heat and 
slow-moving rivers, small towns and farming country, where storytellers spun 
long and fantastic tales. 
</P>
<P>
About this time, when he was in his early 20s, Garcia Marquez returned to his 
hometown of Aracataca with his mother on a trip that he says changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the day I really became a writer. I realized all I had written up to 
that point was invented. It had been due to a congenital capacity to tell 
stories, but I wasn't recounting my reality. I found the town exactly as I 
remembered it, but in ruins, totally deserted. There weren't any people in the 
streets. The banana company had left. Before, I had felt you had to write so 
that people identified and felt good. But when I suffered this shock, I 
realized that probably what I had to do was create a reality that would make 
people uncomfortable, transmit this sense of uneasiness and pain that I 
encountered. And that is what I found in the Southern writers from the United 
States. I returned to Barranquilla 24 hours later, tore up half a novel I had 
written and started over. Since then I haven't changed my concept of 
literature." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marquez says he could not then bring himself to enter the small house in 
Aracataca in which he had been raised, and, although it is a museum today, he 
has yet to go inside. "If I do, I will stop being a writer. The key is inside," 
he says. By way of explanation he offers only this: "I go on instinct. I'm a 
sentimentalist, not an intellectual." 
</P>
<P>
BUT OF COURSE he is an intellectual and, as such, his views on literature, art 
and politics command attention throughout Latin America. As in Europe, writers 
there are considered to have a moral authority that gives their opinions great 
weight. "I take care in every word I say, because I know it resounds in all of 
Latin America," Garcia Marquez says, accurately and matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
His political views have been the subject of debate and controversy for nearly 
30 years. They have been the source of his continuing troubles with the U.S. 
State Department, which considers him an undesirable leftist and restricts his 
entry visas. He can and does go to the United States but only by special 
dispensation from the State Department, a condition that greatly irritates him, 
especially since he admires much about this country. He says with a wry smile, 
"My name will be remembered for hundreds of years because of all those American 
graduate students writing theses about my books." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, his political opinions were shaped by Marxist professors who 
commonly taught in Latin American high schools and universities. From listening 
to his teachers, and from witnessing the economic misery in which so many Latin 
Americans lived, he became convinced that capitalism did not work. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably in those first years I was very radical," he tells us. "But later 
life taught me that no existing system is good enough, because certainly no 
system has a general application. Between high school and my first trip to 
socialist countries I was somewhat a victim of propaganda," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He was a 29-year-old journalist when he made an extended journey through 
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union with friends in 1957. He wrote a series of 
plain-spoken articles on the countries' gloomy cities and disillusioned people. 
</P>
<P>
"Those articles were written with great care so that they were clearly a 
criticism of socialism without being a praise of capitalism. My newspaper, El 
Espectador, didn't publish the articles because they considered them very 
favorable to the socialist countries. And the Marxist left considered them paid 
for by the State Department. When I returned, it was clear to me that, in 
theory, socialism was a much more just system than capitalism. But that in 
practice, this wasn't socialism. At that moment, the Cuban Revolution 
occurred," he says. 
</P>
<P>
One cannot talk about Garcia Marquez without considering his intimate 
relationship with Cuba and his unwavering defense of Fidel Castro, who has read 
several of Garcia Marquez first drafts. The author is not prepared to unmask 
the myth of Fidel as he has with Simon Bolivar; he will not, and possibly 
cannot, bring himself to criticize seriously Castro's aging revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"With Fidel, there is great coherence between the myth and the man. I believe 
in that yth." Besides, he explains, "Fidel is my personal friend. It is very 
difficult to be Fidel's friend and to live in this world." 
</P>
<P>
The one time Garcia Marquez grows angry during days of interviews and telephone 
calls, it is over Castro. He believes the United States has an "almost 
pornographic obsession with Castro. The U.S. press has made him into a devil. I 
have many friends," he says furiously, "and in the world they have been reduced 
to one. I am friends with seven, eight, nine world leaders, with many 
presidents." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly Garcia Marquez feels that to criticize Castro would be to betray his 
friendship and the fundamental values for which Castro stands. They are the 
values that drew Garcia Marquez to Cuba in the first place and prompted him to 
enlist in its revolutionary news service, Prensa Latina, in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cuban Revolution was about national independence and social justice. It 
was a revolution based on national independence 1
