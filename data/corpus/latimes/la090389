<P>
Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is no valentine to the 
comforts of small-town Americana. Instead this 1988 TV reunion for the cast of 
the late '50s-early '60s sitcom, "The Many Lives of Dobie Gillis," revels in 
raucous Borscht Belt humor and big-city cynicism. Along with the silliness 
there's some shameless fun. Dwayne Hickman, Sheila James and Bob Denver star. 
</P>
<P>
Although My Two Loves (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) raises sensitive issues regarding 
lesbianism only to back away from them, Mariette Hartley and Lynn Redgrave are 
splendid as the 1986 TV movie's co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
Akira Kurosawa's 1985 Ran (Channel 28 Monday at 8 p.m.) is his superb reworking 
of "King Lear" in 16th-Century Japan. It's at once a heroic saga of human 
destiny, a war movie with some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed, a 
costume drama of the utmost magnificence -- and a crackling good samurai movie 
chock full of sword play and palace intrigue. Tatsuya Nakadai gives us a great 
Lear, a man who has held power so brutally and for so long he has become 
unaware of how he is truly regarded. 
</P>
<P>
In bringing Tom Kempinski's play Duet for One (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) to 
the screen in 1986, director Andrei Konchalovsky, Kempinski and writer Jeremy 
Lipp clumsily opened up a two-character drama involving an eminent violinist 
(Julie Andrews), stricken with multiple sclerosis, and her psychiatrist (Max 
von Sydow). The result is a film uneven at best but affecting in its final 
moments by sheer dint of Andrews' vibrant presence. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Spielberg's The Sugarland Express (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a 
lively, raucous and finally poignant comedy about a Texas beautician (Goldie 
Hawn) with a strong reason for making her feckless husband (William Atherton) 
break out of a minimum security prison. 
</P>
<P>
Never Give a Sucker an Even Break (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8:30 p.m.) may be W. 
C. Fields' most incoherent film, but it's still pretty funny. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran director Mark Robson provided plenty of gloss for Jacqueline Susann's 
lurid but diverting Valley of the Dolls (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), and 
director Charles Jarrott did pretty much the same for Sidney Sheldon's The 
Other Side of Midnight (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.). (What's really needed is 
"The Greek Tycoon" to form a trilogy.) 
</P>
<P>
An Enemy of the People (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a decent, solid 
presentation of the Ibsen classic, directed by George Schaefer in a style more 
suitable for TV than the big screen. Steve McQueen is quite effective as the 
idealistic, intellectual Dr. Thomas Stockmann, who has discovered that the 
newly discovered springs in his seaside community are poisonous rather than 
curative. 
</P>
<P>
A good-natured 1988 Burt Kennedy TV Western, Once Upon a Texas Train (CBS 
Friday at 9 p.m.), stars Willie Nelson, Richard Widmark and Angie Dickinson. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Burns' engrossing 1985 documentary Huey Long (Channel 28 Friday at 11 p.m.) 
soaks you in facts and perspectives about the controversial Louisiana governor 
and then admirably allows you to come to your own conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere along the way Beat Street (Channel 9 Saturday at 8 p.m.) lost track 
of the South Bronx graffiti artists, rappers and break-dancers we begin to care 
about to turn into an eye-popping musical display. 
</P>
<P>
Re-created from transcripts and shot on tape a mere five weeks after the trial 
of the private school headmistress for the murder of her lover, "Scarsdale 
Diet" author Dr. Herman Tarnower, The People vs. Jean Harris (Channel 9 
Saturday at 10 p.m.) benefits from the understated direction of George 
Schaefer; Ellen Burstyn received an Emmy nomination for her portrayal of 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
The Loves of a Blonde (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.) is the delectable 1965 
Milos Forman romantic comedy made during that exuberant period in Czech cinema 
before the grim events of 1968.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: TRAVELING IN TIME; 
</P>
<P>
AN 1892 SET OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS PORTRAYS A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IN CLEANING OUT our garage once more, I have finally decided to part with a 
treasure -- the 1892 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. 
</P>
<P>
It is not quite complete. Two or three volumes are missing. It was given to me 
by my friend Will Fowler many years ago. I hope he will forgive me for parting 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
It is almost a shock to thumb through these volumes and see how much the world 
has changed in almost a century. In 1892, the British Empire sat astride the 
globe like a sergeant-major, exacting tribute, civilizing savages, keeping the 
peace. It ruled a third of the earth and had no doubt that it would rule 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Navy is called "the bulwark of the nation, and more important for the 
defence of the kingdom than its land forces." With unseemly pride, the 
encyclopedia lists the United Kingdom's ironclad ships of the line, including 
those with such bellicose names as Devastation, Thunderer, Dreadnought and 
Inflexible, which surpassed all other ships in armor, having 16 to 18 inches of 
plate protecting its guns. Although the modern Royal Navy was undoubtedly a 
factor in frustrating the German Sea Lion plan to invade the Sceptered Isle in 
World War II, the 1892 edition hadn't a hint of the airplane to come. To its 
authors, the Battle of Britain in the air was inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Wright Brothers' first heavier-than-air flight was only 11 years 
away, the 23-page article on aerodynamics reviews the history of man's failed 
attempts at flight, back to antiquity, but is devoted mostly to the past and 
future of ballooning. As for heavier-than-air flying, it concludes 
pessimistically: "In all ages . . . great ingenuity has been expended in 
efforts at flying, all of which have as yet resulted in failure . . . and while 
navigation is one of the most perfect of the arts, the power of directing a 
body floating in the air still remains unattained." 
</P>
<P>
Africa, though emerging, is still regarded as the Dark Continent: "This vast 
continent, though associated from the dawn of civilization with traditions and 
mysteries of the most stimulating kind, has remained until recently one of the 
least known, and, both commercially and politically, one of the least important 
of the great divisions of the globe." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the article on Africa is a footnote that places it for us in 
time: "The above article was completed before it was known with certainty that 
the saddest event in the history of African exploration had occurred. Dr. 
Livingstone, to whom the article justly assigns 'the first place among African 
discoverers,' died of dysentery near Lake Bangweolo on the 4th of May, 1873." 
</P>
<P>
I am mystified by the lapse of time between the confirmation of Dr. David 
Livingstone's death (1874) and the publication of that article (1892). Perhaps 
it was written for an earlier edition and reprinted intact. So little did the 
Dark Continent change. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps nothing in the whole set is more amusing to an Angeleno than the 
article on Los Angeles. It reads, in part: 
</P>
<P>
"LOS ANGELES, a city of the United States, the capital of Los Angeles County, 
Calif., is situated in the lowland between the Sierre Madre and the Pacific, 
about 17 miles from the coast, on the west bank of a stream of its own name. It 
lies 483 miles by rail south-south-east of San Francisco on the Southern 
Pacific Railroad, and is connected by branch lines with Wilmington, Santa 
Monica (both on the coast) and Santa Ana. At the centre of a fine orange and 
grape growing country, and a resort for invalids, Los Angeles is a place of 
some importance; and since the opening of the railways it has been in full 
prosperity. . . . "Founded in 1781 by the Spaniards, it received the name 'Town 
of the Queen of the Angels' (Pueblo de la Reina de Los Angeles) as a tribute to 
the beauty and pleasantness of the spot. It was the capital of the Mexican 
state of California from 1836 to 1846, in which latter year it was captured by 
United States forces." I wish I could trade this set in on the 2092 edition. 
What unimagined wonders might it disclose?

CHILDREN OF VIOLENCE; 
</P>
<P>
WHAT HAPPENS TO KIDS WHO LEARN AS BABIES TO DODGE BULLETS AND STEP OVER CORPSES 
ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL?

<P>
THE morning after a 19-year-old gang member was gunned down at a phone box at 
103rd and Grape streets in Watts, his lifeless body lay in a pool of blood on 
the sidewalk as hundreds of children walked by, lunch boxes and school bags in 
hand, on their way to the 102nd Street Elementary School. A few months later, 
during recess, kindergartners at the school dropped to the ground as five shots 
were rapidly fired nearby, claiming another victim. On still another occasion, 
an outdoor school assembly was disrupted by the crackle of gunshots and wailing 
sirens as students watched a neighborhood man scuffle with police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Terrifying occurrences such as these have brought together six youngsters, ages 
6 through 11, who sit in a circle around a box of Kleenex in a colorful 
classroom. The children are a bit fidgety and shy at first, as a psychiatric 
social worker asks if anyone would like to "share" a recent event that made 
them sad. With hesitation, then with the words spilling out, each tells his 
story -- pausing frequently to grab a tissue to wipe away the tears. 
</P>
<P>
"They shoot somebody every day," begins Lester Ford, who is 9 and lives with 
his mother and brother in the vast Jordan Downs housing project across from the 
school. When he's playing outside and hears gunshots, the solemn child says 
softly, "I go in and get under the bed and come out after the shooting stops." 
</P>
<P>
He says he has lost seven relatives. "My daddy got knifed when he got out of 
jail," Lester explains, and suddenly tears begin streaming down his face. "My 
uncle got shot in a fight -- there was a bucket of his blood. And I had two 
aunties killed -- one of them was pushed off the freeway and there were maggots 
on her." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting next to Lester, 11-year-old Trevor Dixon, whose mother and father died 
of natural causes, puts a comforting arm around his friend. "We don't come 
outside a lot now," he says of himself and his twin sister. "It's like the 
violence is coming down a little closer." 
</P>
<P>
When it's her turn, 8-year-old Danielle Glover peers through thick glasses and 
says matter-of-factly: "Just three people (in my family) died." At night their 
ghosts haunt her, she says. "I been seein' two of them." 
</P>
<P>
This is grief class at the 102nd Street Elementary School, and it is one of the 
front lines in the battle against violence in South-Central Los Angeles and 
other urban war zones. Experts and mental health professionals are just 
beginning to learn what happens to children like Lester, Trevor and Danielle as 
they grow into adulthood: Even if these children of violence survive the drugs, 
the gangs and the shootings, they might not survive the psychological effects 
of the constant barrage. 
</P>
<P>
Though therapists are finding encouraging signs of resiliency, they believe 
that no child who is victimized, witnesses violent crime or simply grows up in 
its maelstrom escapes unscathed. Despite a fragmented and sometimes underfunded 
approach, these researchers are developing therapies to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, 102nd Street school principal Melba Coleman, the school guidance 
counselor and the psychologist had seen some children regress to bed-wetting, 
others become overly withdrawn or hostile and good students struggle to 
concentrate. They called on the Los Angeles Unified School District's mental 
health center, and social worker Deborah Johnson, to develop a way to help the 
kids overcome their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 30 children have participated in the weekly hourlong class, which is 
thought to be the first regular grief and loss program for elementary school 
students in the nation. They are encouraged to talk about life, death and ways 
to keep safe in an unsafe world. The hope is that, by sharing their thoughts 
and emotions with others, the children will come to terms with their feelings 
of loss, anger and confusion before long-term, irreversible problems develop. 
And it seems to be working. 
</P>
<P>
Says Kentral Brim, 10, whose two older brothers were killed and who barely 
escaped injury himself during a gang fight that broke out at Martin Luther King 
Jr. / Drew Medical Center: "I was getting mad and fighting." With the group's 
help, the neatly dressed, polite young boy says, "I settled down." 
</P>
<P>
SETTLING DOWN IS hard in South-Central Los Angeles, in the shadow of the famous 
Watts Towers and within a few blocks of four squalid public housing projects. 
Sleepless nights are punctuated by gunshots, sirens and hovering police 
helicopters. Liquor stores are routinely robbed. Children as young as 6 are 
recruited as drug-runners. Some babies' first words and gestures are the names 
and hand signs of their parents' gangs. The very color of one's T-shirt can 
determine whether you live or die, and the most important lesson of childhood 
is that survival depends on hitting the ground when the inevitable shooting 
starts. Some families are so fearful that whenever gang warfare flares up, they 
live behind closed curtains with the lights off, sleeping and eating on the 
floor to avoid stray bullets. 
</P>
<P>
The scope of violence in South-Central Los Angeles is horrifying. In the first 
seven months of this year, there have been 237 homicides, 413 rapes, 5,864 
robberies and 9,068 aggravated assaults in the most turbulent area of the city. 
Thirty-five of the homicide victims were under 18. A study headed last year by 
Dr. Gary Ordog at King/Drew Medical Center found that 34 children under 10 
years old were treated there for gunshot wounds between 1980 and 1987. Records 
showed none in earlier years. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most telling of all is the fact that 90% of children taken to the 
psychiatric clinic at the hospital have witnessed some act of violence, a 
recent survey found. 
</P>
<P>
"How can children see all that (violence) and not be affected?" asks Gwen 
Bozart, a third-grade teacher at Compton Avenue Elementary School. Especially 
when such violence takes place against a landscape of deprivation and failure. 
Standardized school test scores in South-Central Los Angeles are far below the 
average for the rest of the city and state. The dropout rate in some high 
schools is nearly twice that of the rest of the district. More than half the 
adult population is unemployed. And mental health professionals say depression 
and suicide attempts are disproportionately high among a despairing population 
that is barely surviving. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just so much stress that an individual can take before he is 
completely overwhelmed," notes UCLA child psychiatrist Gloria Johnson Powell, 
who grew up in the tough Roxbury section of Boston and this fall will establish 
a center at Harvard University to focus on the special needs of minority 
children. Often, Powell points out, inner-city children witness violence at 
home as well as at school and in the streets. They frequently endure abusive 
family relationships and watch endless hours of romanticized TV violence. 
"(Many of) these children have daily stress from the time they wake up until 
they go to bed," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have found that youngsters growing up in a war-zone environment 
such as South-Central Los Angeles are likely to become anxious or depressed. 
Youngsters who have been direct victims or who have witnessed, say, the brutal 
murder of a parent, are mostly likely to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, 
today's term for a cluster of symptoms recognized in soldiers and others for 
many years but given labels such as "shellshock" or "combat neurosis." 
</P>
<P>
In children, post-traumatic stress disorder takes the form of reliving the 
violent experience repeatedly in play, nightmares and sudden memories that 
intrude during class or other activities. Kids with the disorder can be easily 
startled, apathetic, hopeless or possessed by a fear of death. Many children 
regress to early childhood behaviors such as clinginess, become extremely 
irritable and develop stomachaches and headaches that have no organic cause. 
</P>
<P>
They play differently, too, going beyond the roughhousing that is part of 
normal child development. Such traumatized children tend to be more aggressive 
and more willing to take risks -- wrestling to hurt companions, for example, or 
jumping from high places. Others can become inhibited, forsaking sports they 
used to enjoy, or they might re-enact a gruesome event in play. The popular 
childhood game of ring-around-the-rosy with its "ashes, ashes, all fall down" 
is thought to have originated as a response to the bubonic plague, when 
children watched people die and saw streets filled with corpses. Today, a 
psychiatrist tells of a child who, after having witnessed the stabbing of her 
mother, painted her hands red with her paintbrush. 
</P>
<P>
Most devastating perhaps for school-age children, post-traumatic stress 
disorder reduces the ability to concentrate and remember, resulting in poor 
school performance. But it doesn't stop there. Principal Coleman says the 
teachers at the 102nd Street school identified about 10% of the school's more 
than 1,200 youngsters as showing "high risk" behaviors and notes that these 
children also interfere with the others' ability to learn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"High risk" behaviors, which include repeatedly cursing and hitting adults, are 
thought to be early signs that a child could become a social misfit. 
</P>
<P>
Older children sometimes cope by affecting an indifference to the violence 
around them, experts say. They exhibit an emotional denial that can cripple all 
of their relationships. The seeming indifference is evident in random 
conversations with South-Central Los Angeles children over the last year. One 
group of children spoke dispassionately of finding a murdered woman's mutilated 
body --"her eyeball was in her shoe", a child said. Another group, when told 
about a fatal shooting, appeared less interested in the victim than in the 
details of his shiny new truck and its equipment. And, when asked for class 
field-trip ideas, an 11-year-old boy suggested "how about the cemetery?" 
</P>
<P>
Other conversations reveal further emotional distancing: Several 8-year-olds 
discussing whether the murder of a lifeguard was justified because he had 
ordered someone to get out of the pool agreed that, as one child explained, 
"Yeah, he (the killer) shudda done it." To them, killing seemed a reasonable 
response to a perceived insult. A 16-year-old girl at Jordan High School, 
ticking off the names of at least nine people who have been shot recently, put 
it this way: "The ones (bodies) I see in the street that are killed, that don't 
mean nothin' to me anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Such callous talk among young children alerts mental health professionals to 
underlying emotional difficulties. "You're not going to be very trusting (as an 
adult) if you observe or have close to you violent behavior," says Santa Monica 
therapist Ruth Bettelheim, a former consultant to Head Start and daughter of 
noted child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim. "You tend to keep your distance 
psychologically -- making close and intimate relationships difficult. And that 
isolation fuels depression, which is already there because of previous losses." 
</P>
<P>
But, Bettelheim says, some children are able to make up and overcome the lack 
of certain developmental processes if the adults and children around them can 
offer support. "It's old psychology wisdom that the same fire that melts butter 
hardens steel," she adds, so the very violence that spells destruction for one 
child might make a strong survivor out of another. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist William Arroyo, acting director of the Los Angeles County/USC 
child-adolescent psychiatric clinic, has studied refugee children from Central 
America and children from inner-city areas as well. He acknowledges that 
supportive parents, schools and neighborhoods can serve as buffers against 
stressful environments, then shakes his head sadly at the fact that 
South-Central Los Angeles offers so little: Many households are chaotic and 
headed by uneducated welfare mothers, nutrition and prenatal care are poor, 
mental health programs are scarce and Watts doesn't even have a YMCA, where 
kids can participate in structured activities instead of hanging out and 
getting into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"The more they are exposed to violence, the more desensitized they become until 
it's no longer horrifying but merely an occurrence in daily living," Arroyo 
says. "We are very concerned about those who already have psychiatric disorders 
and those who have poor impulse control, who then witness violence either in 
real life or on television. If youngsters learn that the way of succeeding in 
everyday tasks includes maiming or killing community members, stealing and 
generally engaging in sorts of behavior that larger society calls criminal, 
we'll see a larger population of these types." 
</P>
<P>
THE CALENDAR SAYS it happened more than five years ago. But Ana Anaya Gonzalez, 
now nearly 16, still pictures it clearly. Even when she tries to forget, her 
scarred body and recurring nightmares have been constant reminders. 
</P>
<P>
It was a winter Friday afternoon in South-Central Los Angeles, just as children 
were being dismissed from the 49th Street Elementary School. A deranged 
neighborhood resident fired 57 times at the playground from his second-story 
window across the street, killing two people and injuring 13 others. 
</P>
<P>
Ana, a fifth-grader at the time, remembers that she was playing on the monkey 
bars while her sister, Rosa, went back inside to get her sweater. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it sounded like gunfire, but a friend said, 'No, it's firecrackers.' 
Then a bullet hit the ground near me, and everybody dropped. I fell on my 
knees. I couldn't feel my legs, but I didn't know I was hit." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the school, Rosa's teacher pushed her to the floor and fell on top of 
her to protect her. A passing jogger spotted the sniper, shouted to him to stop 
and, seeing that Ana was moving, threw himself over her. He was hit by the next 
round of gunfire and died two months later. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wearing a pink dress," Ana says, "and when I saw it was full of blood, I 
tried to scream to a teacher in the doorway to help me. He looked at me and 
then turned around and closed the door." 
</P>
<P>
Ana spent five months in the hospital. She lost a kidney, still suffers leg 
pain, cannot bend backward and experiences stomach discomfort when she eats. A 
single bullet wound scars her back; surgical incisions mark her abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
She also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the Dr. 
Quinton C. James, the psychiatrist who treated her and several others injured 
in the sniper attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you're talking about violence in Belfast, Beirut or South-Central Los 
Angeles, I think it all has an impact, although you never know how it will 
manifest itself in a particular child. Up to a point, one child may adapt with 
no (apparent) impairment, while for another it may impair (his) ability to 
function adequately, socially and academically," says James, who recently 
retired as chief of child/adolescent services at the Augustus Hawkins Mental 
Health Center (a part of King/Drew Medical Center) and now works with the 
School Mental Health Center and the Centinela Child Guidance Clinic in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the attack, mental health professionals from the school 
district, the Los Angeles County Mental Health Department, County-USC Medical 
Center and Cedars-Sinai's Center for the Study of Psychological Trauma and 
various university and private consultants volunteered to help students, as 
well as parents and teachers. Over the next several weeks, using art therapy 
(see explanation on page 9) and in-depth discussions of the shooting, the 
experts helped those who had witnessed the attack deal with its shattering 
effects. Social workers continued to work with the children several days a week 
for the next year. 
</P>
<P>
A month after the shooting, a team headed by Dr. Robert Pynoos, an associate 
professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine, returned to see how the 
children were doing. Those most severely affected reported feeling stressed, 
upset and afraid just from thinking about the shooting, and fearful that it 
might happen again. They complained of jumpiness, nightmares, loss of interest 
in activities, difficulty paying attention in school and other disturbances. 
Those who had experienced other violence, an unexpected death or physical 
injury during the preceding year described having renewed thoughts and images 
of that event -- even if they were not directly exposed to the playground 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"You can cope with it," James says he told Ana at the start of her 
psychotherapy. "There are things that happen in life, but you don't have to be 
defeated by them. You'll have physical scars, emotional scars, but you have to 
accept that it happened and that we don't know why. . . . The thing is you're 
still alive . . . and there is something you can do. We'll find out together; 
I'll help you, and so will your family and other relatives, people at school 
and other agencies." 
</P>
<P>
With her determination and the help of intense psychotherapy, Ana's condition 
improved.After seeing James every day for the first month she was hospitalized 
and five days a week for the next four months, she was able to return to finish 
sixth grade at the 49th Street school, although she never again ventured onto 
the playground. 
</P>
<P>
Ana continues to progress, but memories of the shooting plague her, James says. 
As recently as last February -- on the anniversary of the incident -- she told 
James: "I still feel the same way. I get scared about things . . . I get 
nervous and start crying for no reason. I remember everything about the past." 
</P>
<P>
Though she knows the sniper killed himself, Ana occasionally feels as if he is 
stalking her. She is sometimes afraid to be alone and sleeps in a bed with 
Rosa. Until recently, she has had a recurring nightmare: A man is chasing her 
and shoots her. "I wake up when he shoots me and can't go back to sleep," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly an excellent student, Ana has had trouble concentrating, has required 
a tutor and is working at about average academic level -- although her grades 
are improving at Jefferson High School, where she is now a junior. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of Ana's family are desling with the shooting as well. Rosa, now 
14, appears withdrawn and more traumatized than Ana, perhaps because she has 
received less therapy, James said. She was reluctant to return to the school, 
avoids discussing the attack and remains fearful and anxious. 
</P>
<P>
Their mother, Esperanza "Blanca" Gonzalez, a waitress who has four other 
children, suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be hospitalized briefly. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sick for Ana," Gonzalez says. "She is very nervous and restless in the 
classroom. She has lost a lot of her spirit." Gonzalez knows that her daughter 
"cries every night . . . and is sad much of the time," but she says the family 
cannot afford psychotherapy. The Gonzalezes live in the same neighborhood, 
still frightened by the gunshots they hear in the night. "I still get scared," 
Ana says. "When I hear the shots outside, sometimes I feel like they are 
shooting at me." 
</P>
<P>
Ana's mother says she remains bitter about the the police department's failure 
to respond to previous complaints about the sniper's brandishing and firing 
guns. "Until we see blood, we can't do anything about him," she says officers 
told neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
On the outside, Ana is a pretty, dark-haired teen-ager who appears bubbly, 
caught up in plans with her girlfriends for her upcoming Sweet 16 birthday 
party. She landed a summer job selling theater tickets and says she goes to 
dances, parties as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
She is talkative -- but not about the shooting. "It's not going to change 
anything to talk about it," she says, then adds, "but I would like to go back 
to therapy because I like to draw the pictures about what happened. I get too 
nervous now, and I think talking with the doctor helps." 
</P>
<P>
James adds that Ana is one of the lucky ones, a child whose outlook is much 
brighter for having a "very supportive network." Without caring family, friends 
and school personnel, she might have become another trauma victim unable to 
envision a future. But Ana has career hopes, "like maybe becoming a doctor. I 
liked how they worked when I was in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
WHILE EDUCATORS and mental health professionals work closely with youngsters in 
the classroom, researchers continue studying -- and in some cases, debating -- 
how violence affects the young. 
</P>
<P>
The first attempts to evaluate scientifically the phenomenon investigated 
children during wartime. Studies by Anna Freud and others after World War II 
suggested that children are minimally affected by war and sometimes find it 
exciting. This work has now been largely debunked. After studying the survivors 
of Belfast, Cambodia and Beirut, most experts contend instead that the effects 
of trauma can be masked, delayed or minimized -- but never eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts such as UCLA's Pynoos have found that exposure to violence can 
cause physiological changes in a child's developing brain stem, altering the 
brain's chemistry and causing personality changes -- such as impulsive 
behavior, an attraction to danger or a debilitating sense of fear. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the theory, almost all the experts speak with awe of the emotional 
strength children possess, even those youngsters from the bleakest backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few studies exploring the roots of resilience in young children 
followed nearly 700 Hawaiian children over a 30-year period, ending in 1985. 
The study, conducted by Emmy Werner, a child psychologist at the University of 
California, Davis, found that one out of every four children classified as 
"high risk" infants had developed into a competent, confident and caring young 
adult. Some seemed to have a natural strength, but for others, the scales 
tipped from vulnerability to resilience because the children found strong 
emotional support at home, school, work or church. 
</P>
<P>
Raiford Woods, manager of the Jordan High Student Health Clinic, sees examples 
of resiliency every day in the heart of Los Angeles' most violent neighborhood. 
With or without outside support, some of "these kids are marvelous and have the 
psychological strength to survive," he says. "You compare a kid from Watts to 
one from Orange County or Westwood; he can handle twice as much pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Studies and observations like this form the basis for the widely held belief 
among experts that early intervention is essential -- that anti-gang programs 
must begin in junior high, that grade-school children need support to get them 
off to a good start and make them less vulnerable, that "drug babies" and 
preschoolers need special care. And a growing number of programs seek to apply 
this premise in young lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Some (older children) are lost causes," psychiatrist James says. "We have to 
focus our attention on those coming along. I met with some youngsters who all 
told me they'd already been in jail. 'Doc, you're wasting your time with us,' 
one said. 'You work with our little brothers and sisters.' " 
</P>
<P>
A few Los Angeles programs focus on prevention, others with helping youngsters 
cope after the damage has been done. The Los Angeles Unified School District, 
for instance, offers a kindergarten intervention project in which children who 
are identified as having social problems, often stemming from exposure to 
violence, are assigned a volunteer "special friend" to act as a companion and 
confidant. 
</P>
<P>
Preschoolers known to have been prenatally exposed to drugs are the focus of a 
new program at the Salvin Special Education Center, where early childhood 
specialists try to interrupt behaviors, often violent, that are forerunners of 
school failure. 
</P>
<P>
At Jordan High School, alone in the district, all ninth-graders are required to 
take a violence prevention course. Among other things, the course stresses how 
to avoid fights, how to be manly without being macho and how to deal positively 
with anger. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Prevention Intervention Program in Trauma, Violence and Sudden 
Bereavement in Childhood responds to requests for assistance from cities across 
the United States where extreme acts of violence -- such as sniper attacks, 
hostage-taking and shootings -- have occurred. The Cleveland Elementary School 
in Stockton asked for assistance after the mass shooting in January. (While 
these incidents are obviously traumatic, experts say, they differ significantly 
from the chronic violence experienced in the inner city.) The program also 
trains mental health professionals, provides counseling and studies children 
who have witnessed violence in the home or community. Likewise, the 
Psychological Trauma Center affiliated with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center 
provides psychological assistance to schools where tragedy has struck. 
</P>
<P>
Effective ways of coping with a reality that can't be erased are not likely to 
lie with any single approach, the experts say. Nor can therapy ignore the web 
of problems that make dealing with violence even worse. Success lies in the 
cooperative efforts of the police, mental health and health services, schools, 
churches and concerned parents, and in solutions that address violence as well 
as drug abuse, poverty and single-parent homes. 
</P>
<P>
Early-prevention programs are important, such as camp programs that give 
children an opportunity to see the world outside their everyday existence and 
television. Parents, especially mothers, need exposure to alternatives, with 
programs that give them a break from the draining responsibility of caring for 
several children around the clock, on limited resources and without male 
support. And ways to bring fathers into the system also need to be found. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, the 102nd Street school program has focused mainly on grief and 
loss. Run by the school staff, the class is based on the theory that, with the 
support of their peers, troubled children can learn to deal with feelings they 
might otherwise suppress or act out at school or at home. 
</P>
<P>
The program's pilot group began with social worker Johnson reading a story 
about a young boy who flew kites with his uncle. The uncle dies -- "and there 
was not a dry eye in the room," Johnson remembers -- but at the end, the boy 
goes out alone with his kite and remembers the good times they had shared. 
"That set the stage for the rest," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is on recognizing and expressing feelings, getting them to come to 
grips with the fact that they've experienced a loss and leading toward an 
acceptance that loss is something we all experience," says Johnson, who has 
spent most of the past 15 years working with disadvantaged children and their 
families and responding to violent crises at various schools. Activities in the 
grief class include using a "feeling board," on which children draw or write 
whatever they want. Children play a game in which they make faces in a mirror 
to reflect different feelings, and they perform relaxation exercises such as 
deep breathing and stretching. They also listen to soft music while they 
visualize a place that makes them feel good. And they plant small gardens, 
which helps instill in them a sense of responsibility while symbolizing the 
beginning, growth and end of all life. 
</P>
<P>
The program has not been scientifically evaluated. Some participants remain 
deeply troubled and have required referrals for outside counseling, and a few 
families have moved in hopes that memories will fade faster in a new setting. 
But teachers say the attitude, behavior and academic performance of most of the 
youngsters have improved markedly. 
</P>
<P>
It is those little ones who are maturing and progressing amid daily bloodshed 
who give hope to Johnson and her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though all these horrible things are happening, there is a resilience 
there. These children and their families do respond to interventions. They have 
strengths even though life circumstances don't allow them to live outside this 
war zone," she says. "They've seen a lot, but for some some reason they're 
still children, still trying to walk the tightrope between the craziness of the 
adult world and a carefree kind of kid world."

ART THERAPY: DRAWING FROM EXPERIENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
EVEN WHEN children can't verbalize the effect that violence has on them, they 
sometimes express it by drawing pictures full of blood, guns and knives, says 
Dr. Spencer Eth, acting chief of psychiatry of the West Los Angeles Veteran's 
Administration Medical Center and medical director of a trauma unit associated 
with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Eth worked with the crisis team that responded to the shooting at the 49th 
Street Elementary School. He says that when children too traumatized to talk 
are told, "Just draw about anything you want," their pictures reveal much about 
what's on their minds. This enables therapists to ask children to tell a story, 
which usually has some connection with the trauma they have suffered. 
</P>
<P>
For example, after a boy threatened to jump off the roof at an elementary 
school as his horrified classmates watched, children spontaneously made 
drawings that depicted the incident and the hospital where they imagined the 
boy was taken. 
</P>
<P>
Says Eth: "Drawing is one of the most effective techniques we have for getting 
a child to open up and confront difficult feelings -- the first step in 
healing." Lois Timnick

THE TOUGHEST TRADER OF THEM ALL;

<P>
IN SHOWDOWNS WITH THE JAPANESE AND PUSHY CONGRESSMEN, CARLA HILLS IS ALL 
BUSINESS

<P>
THE SENATE FINANCE Committee is about 20 minutes into another of its frequent 
oversight hearings on how tough the Bush Administration intends to be on 
foreign trade, and Republican Sen. Robert Packwood of Oregon, a boyish-looking 
man with an occasionally petulant demeanor, is bearing down on the morning's 
witness. Sounding almost like a prosecutor, Packwood implies that the White 
House has abandoned its once-tough position calling on Europe to phase out the 
subsidies it gives to farmers. Packwood demands to know, chapter and verse, 
exactly how the Administration plans to negotiate the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Like any good negotiator or poker player, the new U.S. Trade Representative, 
Carla A. Hills, is not eager to lay out her strategy before she gets to the 
table. It seems understandable that she might like to lean forward to meet 
Packwood directly, then blurt out something like, "Aw, c'mon, senator -- get 
off my case," -- which the posturing Sen. Packwood might well deserve. But 
Hills is new to the job, and most novices don't take on senior senators such as 
Packwood so soon. So it surprises everyone when she does. "You know, it does 
not help the negotiations for me to sit here and say what our specific strategy 
is," Hills points out quietly, but firmly. After all, she adds: "This is a 
negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
The riposte is so effective that committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, an 
experienced politician who knows when to call a halt to things, does so 
judiciously. "Hang tough, Madam!" he admonishes her, in an unconscious mixture 
of machismo and Southern courtliness. Then, with a side glance at Packwood, he 
breaks into a sheepish smile: " -- and I think you will!" he says, setting off 
appreciative chuckles in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
For Carla Anderson Hills, winning over another lawmaker this morning is a small 
step toward meeting what may be her most formidable challenge: surviving and 
surmounting the many forces trying to shape U.S. trade policy. In her seven 
months as United States Trade Representative, Hills has combined the steely 
self-confidence she showed Packwood with a meticulous attention to detail and 
held her own against antagonists ranging from Congress to the Japanese. A 
former Los Angeles socialite, captain of the Stanford women's tennis team, 
assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, head of the Justice Department's civil 
division and third woman in history to serve as a member of a President's 
Cabinet -- as head of Housing and Urban Development under Ford -- Hills, at 55, 
effectively is the nation's trade minister. She's responsible for formulating 
the Administration's trade policy and for negotiating with foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
It's not glamorous, and the details may be wearying, but Hills' work has a 
major effect on industries and jobs across the country. The more Hills can open 
markets for U.S. goods and reduce unfair competition resulting from government 
subsidies to foreign industries, the more jobs she will create or save at home, 
and the lower prices will be here and abroad. European countries, for example, 
are underwriting their farmers directly and that, the United States contends, 
encourages them to produce more and enables them to sell their huge surpluses 
at discounts that underprice American goods. 
</P>
<P>
To be successful, Hills must satisfy both a President who wants to follow a 
trade policy that is pragmatic and open, and the more-militant members of 
Congress. In addition, Hills' agency -- USTR, as it's known -- must serve as 
"an honest broker" among the other parties that historically have a say in 
setting the nation's trade policy: The treasury, state and commerce 
departments, Office of Management and Budget, labor and private industry. 
</P>
<P>
Although most voters are oblivious to the trade issue, it has become a virtual 
obsession in Washington -- particularly among Democrats, who see protectionism 
as a sure-fire vote-getter. Largely on momentum generated on Capitol Hill, the 
lawmakers passed a massive trade bill last year that imposed such heavy 
requirements on Hills' office that they left her little room to maneuver in 
dealing with other countries. This year, they are nearly rabid about the need 
to "get tough" with Japan, and they are pressuring Hills to do it. 
</P>
<P>
In all these arenas, Hills has proven that she can win her adversaries' 
respect. Although she came into the job with only a minimal exposure to trade 
issues, Hills has been relatively successful in finding the hearts, if not the 
minds, of lawmakers. She testified on Capitol Hill no fewer than 12 times 
during her first few months in office -- unusual for a Cabinet member even at 
the start of an Administration. Bowing to Congress' wishes, she has publicly 
cited Japan for alleged unfair trading practices. She has made lawmakers feel 
that she is on their side in internal debates over trade policy. And, perhaps 
above all, her businesslike, almost-courtroom manner has given her an assertive 
image that sells well on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
A grateful Congress, nearly beside itself after eight years of laissez-faire 
ideology under the Reagan Administration, has exuded praise. "If you were a 
movie, you would be a must-see," a clearly chastened Packwood gushed at Hills 
at a recent Finance Committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hills has earned the grudging respect of her counterparts 
from other countries, most of whom are career politicians and bureaucrats who 
are quick to spot -- and overwhelm -- an amateur. Sir Roy Denman, who until 
July was ambassador to Washington from the Brussels-based European Community, 
extols her as "a class act." 
</P>
<P>
Even the Japanese -- usually sparing in their praise of American officials and 
uncomfortable around high-ranking women -- concede that she is an able 
negotiator. "She is very well-grounded and tough, besides," says a senior 
Japanese official who has sparred with her in private talks. "She is not easy 
to deal with, but we think she will do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Still, not everyone appreciates her style. Not prone to Washington-style small 
talk -- and formal almost to a fault in many of her personal dealings -- Hills 
has earned a reputation as a stickler that takes some old Washington hands 
aback. And some hard-liners complain that she has given too much away in 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Hills-watchers trace much of her style -- and her seeming success so far -- to 
two early loves and influences: the law and the competitive strategies of 
tennis. A lawyer's lawyer -- she worked her way through Yale Law School -- she 
researches every issue meticulously. She thrives on detail. And she negotiates 
as if she were representing a client -- no compromising, at least not until the 
very end. "Carla Hills wants to be the best," says William D. Eberle, a former 
USTR who has come to know the negotiator well as her husband's sometime 
business partner. Adds a USTR associate: "The key to Carla Hills is that she 
really, really hates to lose." 
</P>
<P>
HILLS' OFFICE, in a corner of the Winder Building, a one-time Civil War 
telegraph office across the street from the Old Executive Office Building, is a 
reflection of the reserve and control her adversaries have come to know well. 
The decor is prim and orderly -- a carefully arranged set of government-issue 
furniture, almost bereft of personal eccentricities. Knickknack cabinets at the 
back have only a smattering of personal memorabilia -- conspicuously among them 
a 35mm candid of Hills standing next to Bush. Even the occasional stacks of 
papers are tidy, lawyerly. A vase full of flowers stands, properly, at a corner 
of her desk. 
</P>
<P>
Her appearance telegraphs power -- and a no-nonsense style. Always impeccably 
coiffed in a utilitarian bob -- the easier to touch up before an official 
dinner party -- Hills favors the kind of expensive, severely tailored suits and 
off-white barrister blouses that career women began using in the early 1970s to 
signal their status as professionals. Occasionally, there's some relief -- a 
scalloped edge on a jacket or a bolder-than-usual pattern -- but the overall 
effect is always sober. 
</P>
<P>
To many, Hills represents the quintessential Ice Lady. Cold, intense, serious, 
driven -- these descriptions of Carla Hills often come up in conversations with 
lawmakers, other trade ministers, even her close associates. Although she can 
be charming in private, when she's on the job, she rarely laughs or shows more 
than a flash of humor. She always seems to have her guard up. Light banter with 
lawmakers is not her forte. And virtually everything she says is very studied, 
very controlled. Very legalistic, Washington says. 
</P>
<P>
Hills' first few days in office were an eye-popper for USTR's staff. At her 
request, her new chief of staff, Gary Edson -- dubbed "Mr. Format" by USTR 
associates -- issued a nine-page memorandum on office procedures that jolted 
the previously informal agency. Where lower-level officials used to scrawl a 
phrase or two on the margin of a letter to communicate with Hills' predecessor, 
Clayton K. Yeutter, there now were to be separate categories of memos, each 
identified with a different colored felt-tip marker -- red for decision memos, 
appointments, recommendations and speeches; green for briefing papers, and blue 
for "information" memos. Telephone messages were to have varying colored sheets 
stapled to them, depending on the category of caller. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, staffers say, Hills kicks memos back if they aren't correctly color 
coded. She also keeps her own appointments calendar -- a rarity in 
secretary-conscious Washington, and not always a convenience for underlings. 
"If you want to change even a short conference, you have to talk to her 
directly," one pained senior staffer says. 
</P>
<P>
Most demanding, however, is Hills' penchant (again, litigation-lawyer-style) 
for thick briefing papers that detail every conceivable issue and aspect of a 
problem, presumably no matter how trivial. "The sheer volume of that stuff 
going into the front office has brought about a panic atmosphere," says one 
senior staffer who has been frustrated by it all. "She wants to know all the 
nitty-gritty details -- biographies of individuals who will be at the 
negotiating table and all that." Adds another, ruefully: "She blows up when she 
thinks she is not being adequately informed." 
</P>
<P>
Hills' short fuse already is a legend. Agency staffers have complained that she 
chews out subordinates for what seem to be minor lapses, bearing down almost as 
though she were still a prosecutor. Unable to suffer others' shortcomings 
graciously, Hills also is quick to lash out at what she perceives as mistakes 
-- both in print and in personal relations. "Once she gets you on the run, she 
backs you into a corner," a former staffer says. 
</P>
<P>
She has been frugal with praise. "Clayton (Yeutter) used to send notes that 
some staffers considered patronizing, but those days look good now," a USTR 
official says. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, morale at the agency plummeted during Hills' first days in office. 
Discouraged as well by Congress' refusal to approve a pay raise for federal 
workers, many USTR staffers quickly began looking for new jobs. In one 
instance, two embarrassed USTR officials ran into each other at the same job 
interview. "The resumes were flying," an associate recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Asked during an interview for this article about her reputation as a stickler, 
she is unapologetic. "I would say I try to get as good a performance out of the 
team as I can," she says matter-of-factly. "If that means sending back a paper 
and asking for greater detail, yes, I do do that." 
</P>
<P>
IN EVERY OFFICIAL SETTING, Hills has a practiced formality and competitiveness 
that may stem from her childhood days. Family members say she had to fight to 
prove to her father that she could hack it in what was then clearly a man's 
game. Carl H. Anderson, a transplanted northwest Missouri farm boy who moved to 
Los Angeles after World War II and made a modest fortune in the building-supply 
business, was a hard-driving man. His children lacked for nothing. Young Carla 
Helen Anderson grew up in a world of private schools, horses and frequent 
parties, and she received a good education. The family home, in Beverly Hills, 
was on the same street as the one used in the movie "Sunset Boulevard." The 
Andersons spent their summers on their ranch in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Family members say Hills always had two desires: to go to school in the East 
and to become a lawyer. Yale Law School was her choice. But her father also 
believed that women would only quit careers and squander education to raise 
families. Besides, once they married they couldn't carry on the family name. 
After Carla enrolled in Yale -- she'd earned an undergraduate degree in 
history/economics from Stanford -- her father essentially "cut her off," her 
husband, Roderick M. Hills, recalls. Earning her way by working summer jobs, 
she graduated in 1958, ranking 20th in a class of 167 -- one of only 11 women 
in the group. 
</P>
<P>
It was at Stanford that she met Rod Hills, then a third-year law student from 
Seattle. A gregarious, easygoing sort of man, Rod is her personality opposite. 
Acquaintances say Rod Hills serves as an occasional adviser. He also frequently 
loses to her in tennis. The two married in September, 1958, just after she took 
-- and passed -- the California bar exam. Despite high marks all around, her 
first real challenge was getting a job. She had made the rounds of private 
firms, but in those days, most law firms weren't ready to accept women. All she 
could turn up was a "woman's job" -- doing wills and probate at a firm that 
counted her father as a major client -- so she applied for a federal post, as 
an assistant U.S. attorney for civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
For all her experiences, Hills is not flamboyantly feminist. Her aides seek to 
discourage interviewers from asking about her personal life or about how it 
feels to be one of only two women in the Cabinet. (The other, Elizabeth Dole, 
is Bush's Secretary of Labor.) And she studiously avoids using feminist jargon. 
On one level, she almost dismisses the whole issue of discrimination: "Well, 
you couldn't be my age and not have felt that there was some," she says with a 
shrug, "but I think I've really been pretty lucky. For one thing, I'm not 
looking for the problem. And that's always been the case." 
</P>
<P>
Although her three top deputies all are men, she has larded the middle level of 
USTR with women -- her agency's chief lobbyist, her private sector liaison 
officer and her press secretary all are women. During National Secretaries Week 
last spring, Hills called all USTR's secretaries -- all women -- together for a 
"woman-to-woman" talk about what the agency does and why it is important. 
</P>
<P>
Hills has racked up all her achievements seemingly without seriously taxing her 
family -- a rarity in Washington for senior officials of either sex. 
Acquaintances recall that during Hills' days as HUD secretary, when demands at 
the office were particularly heavy, Hills still found time to attend her 
youngsters' school functions. "Her housekeeper would drive the kids, and Carla 
often would arrive late -- but she'd get there," recalls a parent of one of the 
Hills children's classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Three out of the four Hills children are in -- or heading toward -- careers in 
law. Laura, 28, a Stanford graduate, is an attorney at Patton, Boggs, &amp; 
Blow, a prestigious Washington law firm. Prevented by her mother's position 
from handling trade cases, she has settled for contracts on international 
transactions. Rick (Roderick Jr.), 24, a first-year law student at Yale, is 
interning at another Washington firm. And Megan, 23, who just finished her 
master's degree at Georgetown University, is entering Stanford University Law 
School. Another daughter, Alison, 18, is a sophomore at Stanford. The Hills 
children's interest in law "is just individual" and had relatively little to do 
with the fact that their parents both are lawyers, Laura Hills says. "Of 
course, they were both an inspiration," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
The Hillses still live in the spacious, boxy home in Washington's fashionable 
Spring Valley area that they have occupied since her days at HUD. A 
California-modern standout in an otherwise-traditional neighborhood of stately 
brick colonials, it sports a swimming pool and -- of course -- a tennis court. 
Friends say Hills still plays a solid -- and aggressive -- game (her partners 
have included the likes of Jack Valenti, president of the Washington-based 
Motion Picture Assn. of America, and Tom Brokaw of NBC Nightly News, an old 
friend who describes her game as "very strong but graceful.") 
</P>
<P>
Carla Hills repeatedly has been mentioned as a possible nominee for the U.S. 
Supreme Court, but she has neither lobbied for consideration nor admitted 
publicly to hoping for it. "She's too private a person" even to discuss it, Rod 
Hills concedes. 
</P>
<P>
CARLA HILLS' PREOCCUPATION WITH detail -- and her ability to master it -- had 
served her well by the time she moved into the trade negotiator's office. When 
Gerald Ford nominated her to become Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
in 1975, critics groused that she didn't know the subject matter, had no 
experience in the housing field and wasn't particularly well-known in 
Washington. HUD then -- as now -- was rife with scandal, mismanagement and 
plummeting morale. But the new secretary quickly showed that she could be a 
capable -- and efficient -- administrator. Within weeks, she had cleaned up 
most of the mess, tightened up HUD procedures and breathed new life into the 
low- and moderate-income housing programs that most analysts had thought would 
never get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Hills also began her current tenure amid a flurry of controversy. As well as 
facing critics who believed that she knew little about the complexities of 
trade, she was barraged with queries about the conflicts of interest that might 
arise because both she and her husband had recently served as lawyers and 
lobbyists for foreign firms. 
</P>
<P>
The Hillses had registered in 1985 as foreign agents for Daewoo Industrial 
Ltd., a South Korean company, and had worked on behalf of some Canadian firms. 
And both were on a spate of corporate boards. At that time, Rod Hills was 
running a consulting business that dealt largely with foreign companies. He had 
been chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Ford 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But Hills disposed of the conflict-of-interest issue in a direct -- and 
unusually self-sacrificing -- fashion: She promised the Senate Finance 
Committee that both she and her husband would sever all business ties and 
investments "that could conceivably present a conflict" with the decisions she 
would have to make as trade chief, and that she would abstain from taking part 
in decisions affecting such issues whenever they came up. In an unprecedented 
move, her husband pledged not to become involved in anything that either her 
own agency or the independent Office of Government Ethics believed might pose a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Job secured, Hills was practically on her own to learn the ropes. Bureaucratic 
delays meant that the positions of her three top deputies went unfilled until 
June. And there was heavy turnover in the department after the Reagan era, so 
few old hands remained. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures on Hills, and her workload, were almost unprecedented. The United 
States and Europe were locked in a fight over how quickly Europe would phase 
out its farm subsidies. The impasse had stalled a much more important 
discussion called the Uruguay Round (named because it was launched in Punta del 
Este, Uruguay) -- a 106-country negotiation aimed at reducing agricultural 
subsidies and writing new rules to cover trade in services, investment and 
intellectual property (patents, trademarks and copyrights). That the talks are 
the centerpiece of the Administration's trade strategy only heightened the 
sense of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the United States and the European Community (the Common 
Market's latest mutation) were on the brink of a mini-trade war because the 
Europeans refused to accept America's hormone-treated beef. Hills' department 
had to prepare dozens of new reports, almost immediately, that were required by 
a massive 1,000-page trade bill that Congress had passed the year before. And, 
under a provision known as Super 301, she had to come up with a plan for 
publicly targeting other countries' "unfair" trade practices: She'd have to 
stir up a hornet's nest by virtually accusing other governments of bad faith 
even before they began to negotiate. Worse yet, the new Administration had not 
even hammered out its overall approach on trade policy. How, Washington 
wondered, would Hills cope with it all? 
</P>
<P>
Hills went to work. February, when her office was under especially heavy 
pressure, may have been the cruelest month: It was, she recalls with a hint of 
a smile, "consumed with the Uruguay Round stalemate . . . beef hormones . . . 
escalating passions." 
</P>
<P>
But she broke the farm-subsidy impasse with Europe. She headed off a potential 
trade war over Brussels' decision to ban beef from hormone-treated cattle. She 
won new concessions from Japan on its barriers to U.S. telecommunications 
products. She limited a push by the steel industry to extend current import 
quotas another four or five years. And she helped force the Bush Administration 
to renegotiate an eleventh-hour Reagan-era deal with the Japanese over joint 
development of an advanced fighter aircraft, the FSX; trade hawks had contended 
that the United States had been bested in the original accord. Some critics 
complained that she "gave away the store" on the hormones issue by relegating 
the fight to a low-profile committee rather than fighting to the finish. 
Nevertheless, Hills' action averted a transatlantic food fight that might have 
damaged broader trade-liberalization talks. 
</P>
<P>
In her initial dealings with her overseas counterparts, Hills was stern, and 
sometimes didactic. A senior Japanese official who has dealt with Hills from 
the start recalls that at their get-acquainted meeting, "she was almost like a 
headmistress. She listened to what I had to say, then delivered a lecture." 
</P>
<P>
Her aggressiveness -- and her newness to the field -- made Hills seem a 
hard-liner, at least at the outset. Under continual pressure from Congress, she 
vowed publicly -- and privately -- to enforce the new trade law strictly. She 
complained frequently about foreigners' unfair trade practices, bluntly warning 
Japan even before she was appointed that "we have to have results" if Tokyo 
wanted to head off trade retaliation by the United States. And she frequently 
allied herself with Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, whose industry-led 
pronouncements on trade policy -- calling for more activist government programs 
to help industry become more competitive -- have played well among senators and 
some manufacturers, but have sent shudders through economists and diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
But two events since then have brought on a greening -- or at least a 
broadening -- of Hills' approach. The first, in late March, was the interagency 
process -- a long, drawn-out procedure in which the Cabinet-level Economic 
Policy Council reviews major trade and budget decisions. The council includes 
the secretaries of state, treasury, commerce, defense, agriculture, USTR, the 
White House National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget, 
and not all agree with the more hawkish views of Congress and Mosbacher. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Hills came into contact with top officials who were openly 
appalled at her hard-line approach. It was her first exposure to the internal 
tug of war that invariably accompanies trade policy making. In their 
discussions of how to handle the Super 301 requirements, State pointed out that 
Japan -- the country that hard-liners most wanted to punish for trade 
imbalances -- was America's most important ally in the Pacific, and a major 
financial power. Treasury expressed concern that a crackdown might send the 
dollar plunging and discourage Japanese investors. And Michael J. Boskin, 
another Californian who is chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic 
Advisers, warned publicly that Japan's possible retaliation to such tough 
action could bring on a global recession. Boskin -- naively, some thought -- 
recommended flouting Congress and simply refusing to name any target countries 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
A second shocker came in May, at a meeting of trade ministers from the 24 
largest industrialized countries, members of the Paris-based Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development, a prelude to the annual seven-nation 
economic summit. For two solid days, trade minister after trade minister pelted 
the United States for using Super 301 to prosecute U.S. trade complaints 
against other countries instead of using the multi-nation process it had helped 
set up. Nations "should not be judge and jury" over their own trade disputes, 
complained Europe's spokesman, Frans Andriessen of the Netherlands. Hills 
eventually ended up assuaging the group, reminding them -- in the technically 
precise terms they'd come to expect from her (though some thought this argument 
disingenuous) -- that so far, Washington had merely listed its negotiating 
priorities, and hadn't yet retaliated. But it was a learning experience, 
nevertheless. "I think it opened her eyes a bit," an associate says. 
</P>
<P>
Hills' decision on Super 301 in late April reflects her evolution. By any 
measure, it was deftly crafted. In a minimalist action designed to obtain 
maximum impact, Hills named only three countries -- Japan, Brazil and India. 
She also named six specific trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
But the package had something for everybody. By hitting Japan, she appeased 
Congress and its anti-Japan kick. Adding Brazil and India, both of which had 
been stumbling blocks in the Uruguay Round negotiations, enabled her to say she 
was not "singling out" Japan, thus saving some face for a valuable U.S. ally. 
And the trade practices for which she cited Tokyo were old and relatively easy 
for the two governments to resolve -- Japan's refusal to buy U.S.-made 
satellites and supercomputers, and its overly restrictive standards on 
foreign-made plywood. Negotiations with the Japanese already are under way. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, not all the cleverness on the Super 301 package was Hills' own 
doing. In fact, she argued for a much stricter-sounding list than the White 
House ultimately adopted, and scaled it back steadily in the face of increasing 
objections from the State Department and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Through all that, however, Hills insists that she still is a free-trader at 
heart. Just as she opposes foreigners' policies that give their industries an 
advantage over United States producers, she opposes protectionist U.S. laws as 
well. She made no secret of her distaste for extending the current U.S. quotas 
on steel and sugar imports. And, since the OECD meeting in late May, she has 
taken a softer tone in talking about Super 301. "I did not draft it. I did not 
sponsor it. I only swore to uphold it," she told trade ministers at the Paris 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Hills may be the most powerful USTR since the Carter Administration. Yeutter 
was constrained by then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who kept a tight 
grip on trade policy in his role as head of the Economic Policy Council. But 
the current Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, has left her freer rein. 
</P>
<P>
The USTR's job has proved "more complex" than she had expected, she concedes. 
"It's broader than, say, housing." As for dealing with U.S. trading partners, 
she says, she has learned that "their situation is just as complicated as ours. 
It is just as difficult (for them) to get a consensus (in their governments) as 
it is to get two congressional committees (here) to see things the same way." 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S MORE TO THE JOB, Hills is learning, than the give and take among 
agencies and nations. There's also selling her positions to the public, dealing 
with the media, winning allies in the Administration and contending with the 
occasional scandal. Perhaps her most conspicuous flaw has been her difficulty 
in articulating her agency's doings to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
P.R.-bungling cost the Administration much of the effect it could have had 
domestically in announcing its decisions on the Super 301 cases. There was much 
political mileage to be gotten from this "talking tough" to Japan. But Hills 
announced the final decisions in a chaotic fashion, delaying scheduled 
briefings repeatedly after discovering that the State Department had not 
notified the foreign countries involved. Even some Hill staffers who had been 
instrumental in writing the law were confused about what the Administration 
actually had done in the 301 cases. Uncomfortable around the media even now, 
Hills first refused through a spokesman to be interviewed for this article, 
then, later, changed her mind. 
</P>
<P>
Her relationship to Bush -- closer than that of some Cabinet officers, not as 
chummy as others -- is decidedly an asset. An early adviser and occasional 
tennis partner of the President's over the years -- both, after all, are Yale 
graduates -- Hills keeps a poster-sized photograph on the wall of a conference 
room adjoining her office showing Bush giving Hills a crowbar at her 
swearing-in ceremony. At the bottom, printed with a felt-tip pen is a brief 
legend: "To Carla -- I know you'll use this with finesse and strength. George." 
Bush publicly stops to chat with Hills and invites her in to talk. Word of that 
kind of access gets around quickly in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
But Hills still is regarded as "combative" by other top Administration policy 
makers -- too quick to "escalate an argument," one insider says. And 
Administration hallways are filled with stories of how a mid-level official who 
failed to do Hills' bidding on some relatively minor project finds himself 
chewed out the next day by his Cabinet secretary, who in turn has been badgered 
by a follow-up call from Hills. 
</P>
<P>
One senior official in another agency responded to a call from USTR recently 
with the bluntly worded query: "Is this conversation safe, or is it likely to 
result in another Hills-to-the-secretary phone call?" 
</P>
<P>
The trade representative faced unexpected difficulties July 17 when a House 
subcommittee probing scandals at HUD during the Reagan Administration grilled 
her for several hours over some work she did as a lawyer in 1984 on behalf of 
DRG Funding Corp., a Washington-based firm that is now under investigation by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation for alleged underwriting abuses in a 
federal housing program. 
</P>
<P>
Hills told the subcommittee that she met with then-HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce 
four times that year to lobby the secretary to ease restrictions on a project, 
but she said she "never had a hint of fraud or intentional wrongdoing" on DRG's 
part from HUD officials. And she expressed no surprise that Pierce would have 
met with her. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly would have seen DRG had I been secretary" then, she said. The 
panel apparently won't pursue the case. "Even bad companies are entitled to a 
lawyer," Hills notes unapologetically. 
</P>
<P>
HOW WELL HILLS WILL DO FROM here is an open question. With seven months' 
experience under her belt, Hills clearly is becoming more comfortable with 
trade issues. On a recent swing through the Hague for a trade ministers' 
meeting, she was relaxed -- and effective, foreign trade officials say -- in 
brainstorming sessions with the Europeans and Japanese. Hills-watchers say the 
arrival of her top deputies -- who are experienced and competent enough to 
assume a large portion of the burden -- may give the new USTR more time to 
develop a long-term strategy for the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
That would help her answer what is perhaps the most frequently voiced complaint 
about her performance: that, although she has succeeded so far in resolving 
short-term problems, she has no long-term strategic agenda. "Where is American 
trade policy headed?" former Nixon-Ford trade strategist Harald Malmgren asks, 
almost rhetorically. By necessity, perhaps, Hills' agenda so far has been 
determined mostly by previously scheduled events, such as congressionally set 
deadlines for launching unfair-trading-practices cases or a conference on the 
Uruguay Round. What was on the plate before is what has been on the plate so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
The spate of Super 301 cases now behind her, Hills' most important task is to 
shepherd the Uruguay Round talks to their scheduled close in late 1990 -- a 
Gargantuan task involving some 18 international negotiating committees, 
hundreds of arcane nuts-and-bolts trade provisions and strong leadership on 
Hills' part both abroad and at home. The stakes are high. Malmgren says how she 
performs during those talks could affect U.S. trade policy for the next two 
decades. If the Uruguay Round collapses, protectionism -- and worldwide 
economic and political frictions -- almost certainly will result. 
</P>
<P>
Hills agrees. For the longer-term, Hills still envisions a widening of trade 
opportunities -- in the Pacific Rim, in Mexico, in Europe and with "an enormous 
opening of Japan." But she concedes that "all those feed off finishing the 
Uruguay Round," which she calls "our top priority to implement our trade 
strategy." Managing the broad-based trade negotiations is "an enormous 
challenge," she acknowledges. "It's an enormous job in communications." She 
also is concerned about the increasing trends of economic nationalism that have 
begun making their way through the country, intensifying pressures to close 
U.S. markets and bar foreign investors here. "There is a great deal of 
misinformation" about the effects of barring investment in the United States, 
she says. For now at least, Hills remains a bit of an unknown, not giving away 
her likely strategy, either for her own job as USTR or for the talks with the 
Europeans and Japanese. If she succeeds, she doubtless will be happy to explain 
what she did, in retrospect, in a very measured -- and legalistic -- fashion. 
And if she fails? Well, Sen. Packwood, don't even ask.

Reading "The Rest of the Best," by Jill Gottesman, I was completely disgusted 
by the comment of Charles English, who defended a young drunk driver who killed 
a family of four. He said of the defendant, "There's no way this kid knew that 
if he killed someone while on the road, he would spend the better part of his 
life behind bars." 
</P>
<P>
So when has ignorance of the law been an excuse for committing a crime? Would 
this young man have not driven drunk if he thought he would receive only a 
three- to five-year sentence -- instead of 30 years -- for killing four people? 
It is time people in our society are held responsible for their actions.

"The Defender," by Joy Horowitz (July 23), was subtitled "Some Say Leslie 
Abramson Is the Best Female Criminal Defense Lawyer Around. Others Say She's 
the Best, Period." That leaves me with one question: Best what? She's a leader 
in keeping California killers off Death Row. Is that something to be proud of? 
Some of these same people will be released to kill again. Others that remain in 
jail feed off of tax dollars for the rest of their worthless lives. To what 
end?

John Hurst says in "Why I Own a Gun" that "statistics indicate that owning a 
gun is a deadly gamble." He contrasts the number of guns stolen (which has 
nothing to do with the "deadly gamble"), the number of suicides (which is also 
not a gamble, but a purposeful act that can be committed by any number of 
means, all equally deadly), the number of willful homicides (a legitimate 
number), the number of accidents (also a legitimate number), with the number of 
justifiable homicides by citizens of criminals. What was neglected here is the 
number of crimes prevented by firearms without a shot being fired and usually 
not reported. The national figures show that more than 1 million instances of 
crimes are thwarted every year by private citizens (reported in the journal 
Social Problems in February 1988). California's population is about 10% of that 
of the United States; that means about 100,000 crimes did not happen because of 
firearms, compared to Hurst's total of deaths committed with guns -- 3,740 
(that includes suicides). Perhaps it is not such a gamble after all?

We cannot stop the flow of drugs into this country, so by what marvelous, 
wonderful miracle are we going to stop the flow of restricted weapons? The 
criminal will always be well armed; only the private citizen will be denied 
access to the marketplace.

VINTAGE CLOTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
CLOTHES FROM BYGONE days aren't only antique items to hang in a closet; they 
are pieces of history that can continue to adorn the wearer. They're well made, 
and their very age imparts style. Longevity counts. 
</P>
<P>
But old clothes in good condition can cost big bucks, especially the popular 
Victorian and Edwardian white cottons and slinky, bias-cut '30s gowns. And it 
would seem that only the very tiniest of our ancestors bequeathed their clothes 
to a future generation; finding a bejeweled '20s cocktail dress that fits a 
healthy '80s body is a Grail-level quest. 
</P>
<P>
It is a fairly simple task for a dressmaker of average skill to stitch up some 
neo-vintage clothes. The only problem is that old-fashioned patterns are not 
widely available (the patterns, like the clothes, are now collectible). 
Folkwear, a company that had printed some wonderful vintage and ethnic styles, 
is now out of business. Many current Vogue, Butterick, McCall's and Simplicity 
patterns can be altered -- if one is adept at that sort of thing -- and old 
clothes can be copied, traced line for line using lightweight interfacing 
material as the pattern fabric. This sounds more difficult than it is, but for 
the novice clothes copier, I strongly advise first making that most dreaded of 
all sewing chores, a muslin "trial" garment; this gives the sewer a preview, 
one that can be inexpensively altered until it's right. The alterations on the 
muslin garment are transferred to the interfacing-fabric pattern pieces, which 
are then ready for the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Past Patterns -- patterns based on vintage clothes from 1830 to 1949 (most are 
from the late 19th Century) -- are available at Upstairs Antiques in Vista and 
Uniforms of Antiquity in San Diego; they can also be purchased from the company 
at P.O. Box 7587, Grand Rapids, Mich. 49510 (catalogue is $5). 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Adult School, at Beverly Hills High, regularly offers classes in 
dressmaking; Sew Special in Vista teaches French machine sewing -- the 
technique of applying lace to fine fabrics, as in Victorian and Edwardian 
clothing. The American College for the Applied Arts in Westwood schedules 
classes in basic sewing, fundamentals of fashion design (pattern drafting and 
draping) and more advanced specialty courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Consumer's Guide to Vintage Clothing," by Terry McCormick (Dembner Books) 
lists many sources for fabrics, supplies and clothing. "Making Patterns From 
Finished Clothes," by Rusty Bensussen (Sterling Publishing Co. Inc.) gives 
detailed instructions for copying garments without dismantling them. "How to 
Make Sewing Patterns," by Donald H. McCunn (Design Enterprises of San 
Francisco), although contemporary in focus, details the basics of pattern 
construction.

DO-IT-YOURSELF DESIGN

<P>
YOU'VE FINALLY MADE the big decision to renovate that tired old bathroom or 
even to build your dream house on a hillside view lot. What do you do before 
you call in the architects and contractors, before you take out a second 
mortgage? 
</P>
<P>
Simple. You design it yourself. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a series of home design kits from Stanley Tools called 
"Project Planners," even if you can't draw, you can still produce a detailed 
guide that will show the professionals exactly what you have in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The kits are an inexpensive means to create plans in four categories: homes, 
kitchens, decks and landscapes. Each kit, priced from $19.95 to $29.95, 
includes a scale ruler and hundreds of drawn-to-scale peel-and-stick symbols -- 
doors, appliances, fireplaces, furniture, shrubs and lighting fixtures. The 
symbols attach to a board with grid markings for scale; the kitchen kit is 
three-dimensional so you can stack cabinets and appliances to check the 
effectiveness of your design. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best feature of the kits is the flexibility of the models; they are 
a real plus for those who can't quite visualize just how close their favorite 
sofa will be to the swinging kitchen door. The peel-and-stick symbols can be 
put anywhere you want; if that location doesn't suit your fancy, just move it. 
</P>
<P>
On a practical level, the planning kits can help homeowners save time and money 
as well as avoid serious -- and costly -- mistakes. In an era when even a 
simple kitchen remodeling can cost $10,000 -- with the sky the limit at the top 
end of the scale -- any mistake can be a financial setback. 
</P>
<P>
And, if nothing else, the kits are really great fun to play with, sort of 
dollhouses for adults. When was the last time you got to lay out your own 
vision of Tara? 
</P>
<P>
 "Project Planners" from Stanley Tools are available at Hennessey &amp; Ingalls 
in Santa Monica; A.C. Vromans in Pasadena; Rizzoli Bookstore in Costa Mesa; 
Squires Lumber in Colton; Upscale in Santa Barbara, and at Waldenbooks, B. 
Dalton Bookseller and Brentano's.

BATTERSEA ENAMEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM BURCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ENAMEL, MADE BY fusing glass powder to a metal base, shares the beauty and 
decorative qualities of the precious metals. The work has been known since 
ancient times, but Egyptian or Greek and Roman enamel, indeed anything before 
the 18th Century, is difficult to find today. 
</P>
<P>
For the contemporary collector, however, some of the most appealing examples of 
painted enamel are English, made in Chelsea and Battersea, where many rococo 
pieces were produced in the 18th and early 19th centuries: candlesticks, boxes 
of every sort (many with aphorisms and romantic sayings painted on them), 
decanter labels and buttons and occasionally some larger piece, such as a 
platter. More sophisticated enamel work was regularly produced on the Continent 
-- at Sevres and Limoges and Meissen, for example. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous factory for decorative enamels was set up in England about 1750 
at York House in Battersea (a section of London) by Sir Stephen Theodore 
Janssen. The factory appears to have ceased production in 1756. The method 
chiefly used was by transfer printing from a copperplate engraving onto a 
background of smooth white enamel laid on a copper base. An advertisement of 
the day lists some of the factory's regular products: snuff boxes of all sizes, 
square and oval pictures of the Royal Family, as well as "other pleasing 
subjects for the cabinets of the curious; bottle tickets, with chains, for all 
sorts of liquors; watch cases, tooth-pick cases, coat and sleeve buttons, 
crosses and other curiosities, mostly mounted in metal, double gilt." 
</P>
<P>
Soon enough, "Battersea enamel" came to be the general term describing all 
English decorative enamels produced in the 18th and early 19th centuries. In 
England, such work was usually made at Chelsea and Battersea and at some of the 
potteries in Staffordshire. Enamels actually made at York House in Battersea 
were relatively few in number and are now highly prized. Decanter labels are 
the easiest to find. They are larger than the usual ones, and it will cost many 
hundreds of dollars today to obtain an authentic enamel label (or "bottle 
ticket") from York House. Even a Battersea-style enamel of 1780, set in a 
modern gold surround and clearly not made at York House, will sell at auction 
for anything between $900 and $1,500. It is a tribute to the skills of the York 
House craftsmen that fine English enamel work -- whether on decanter labels or 
boxes or buttons -- is called Battersea enamel. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for enamel work at Robert Stewart Reed Antiques in Los Angeles; Richard 
Gould Antiques Limited in Santa Monica; Cranberry Cottage Antique Mall in 
Pasadena; Panache Unlimited in Fullerton; Coleman's Antiques in Manhattan 
Beach; Roberta Gauthey Antiques and Richard Yeakel in Laguna Beach; Collector's 
Thrift Shop in Santa Ana; Antique Emporium in Costa Mesa, and Mission Gallery 
and Hood Antiques in San Diego.

PONY RIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY DIEHL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SMALL CHILDREN LOVE pony rides, but by the time they are about 5 years old, the 
thrill of riding slowly around a small ring is pretty well gone. By age 6, 
children are ready for bigger adventures -- sitting on a full-sized horse and 
controlling the reins alone. 
</P>
<P>
Rental stables used to be plentiful in Southern California. But urbanization 
has turned many stables into subdivisions, and insurance costs have made it 
prohibitive for others to stay in business. Fortunately, there are still 
stables and equestrian centers that rent horses by the hour or day. Many of 
them are convenient to trails that take riders through some of our most scenic 
areas. In general, stables do not accept reservations -- plan to arrive early, 
especially on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Rental stables have varying requirements for young riders. Some will send a 
guide or escort along (even on adult rides). Others will permit small children 
to double up with a parent or other adult. Some adjust their requirements after 
sizing up the situation at hand. An apprehensive 4- or 5-year-old will probably 
be asked to ride behind an adult, but a confident rider the same age will be 
given the reins. 
</P>
<P>
 Stables that rent horses to children include J.P. Stables in Burbank -- 
children must be at least 6; Sunset River Trails Equestrian Center in El Monte 
-- smaller children may ride double with a parent; El Cerrito Stables in Corona 
-- children must be 7 to ride alone, younger children may double up with a 
parent; Sunset Ranch in Hollywood -- guides accompany all rides, children must 
be 6 to ride solo; Smoke Tree Stables in Palm Springs -- family horse-back 
riding; Hilltop Stables in south San Diego -- parents must sign consent/release 
form, children must be at least 5 and able to control a horse to ride alone, 
and Sandi's Rental Stable in San Diego -- children 5 and under may ride with an 
adult.

UNION CONTRIBUTIONS STILL VITAL TO AMERICA'S WELL-BEING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to express my opinion about the Aug. 13 Viewpoint, "Making a Case 
for Unions." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most durable and influential kinds of labor organizations promoting 
improvements in worker legislation are AFL-CIO central labor bodies and state 
federations of labor around the United States. 
</P>
<P>
These vital units (their leaders never sleep) sponsor legislation, or 
amendments to existing legislation, in state capitals around the country. 
Currently, for example, the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, is leading 
the way in cooperation with management and the governor for a complete overhaul 
of California's workers' compensation statute. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Los Angeles County we have one of the heaviest concentrations of local 
unions in the world. Some 400 locals are affiliated with the Los Angeles County 
Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, the largest central labor body in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the leaders of this powerful labor organization have pushed year 
after year for improvements in legislation to increase the benefits to 
unemployed workers through unemployment and disability insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Union haters should be reminded that any increases in workers' compensation, 
unemployment or disability benefits from union-sponsored bills passed into law 
by state legislatures, are benefits available to all injured or unemployed 
workers who qualify -- union and non-union alike. 
</P>
<P>
The role of craft unions in promoting additional skilled manpower for America's 
work force through apprenticeships should not be forgotten. Carpenters, 
electricians, plasterers, bricklayers, plumbers and painters must complete 
four-year apprenticeship programs to reach journeyman status. 
</P>
<P>
Local unions in these trades, and in other occupations that use apprentices, 
are a vital part of our economic past, present and future. They are here to 
stay. We should look upon these kinds of unions with appreciation and pride 
because they are among the key elements in building a better, quality America.

<P>
With California's Republican Party torn by a bitter presidential primary back 
in 1964, GOP State Chairman Gaylord E. Parkinson laid down the law for the 
future: "Thou shalt not speak ill of any other Republican." 
</P>
<P>
That "11th commandment" rallied feuding Republicans around their 1966 
gubernatorial nominee, Ronald Reagan. And, over the years, party loyalty has 
helped the GOP overcome Democratic registration to win elections in California. 
</P>
<P>
But now, with critical 1990 elections nearing, this vaunted unity is threatened 
by perhaps the most divisive issue to face state Republicans in decades: 
Abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court decision July 3 on the Missouri abortion case -- Webster 
vs. Reproductive Health Services -- has forced that emotional issue onto 
California's political agenda just when lawmakers gear up for another pitched 
battle: to determine which party will control the 1991 reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the 1990 state elections are so important. And that is why 
politicians are nervous about electoral wild cards that might threaten the 
equilibrium of their carefully crafted political support. 
</P>
<P>
Will abortion prove to be a cutting issue for California's voters? Who wins and 
who loses as the politics of abortion are interjected into next year's 
contests? 
</P>
<P>
That depends. Despite all the hoopla surrounding the victory of a GOP 
pro-choice candidate in the recent special election in San Diego County for the 
heavily Republican 76th Assembly District, it's too early to tell. The 76th 
district election was "a fluke," said Jan van Lohuizen, a Republican pollster 
in Washington: "Be careful in extrapolating from special to normal primary 
elections, because the process is so different and the numbers are so much 
smaller. As a result it is much easier for a single-issue constituency to 
really have an effect." 
</P>
<P>
The primary elections are nine months away -- several lifetimes by the 
political clock. "Our attention spans are so short," Van Lohuizen said, "so I 
think there's a good possibility that the issue might have gone away." But the 
U.S. Supreme Court may overturn Roe vs. Wade, the abortion-rights decision, 
next year -- possibly just as the California primary campaigns begin to crest. 
What then? The answer may differ with each political contest. 
</P>
<P>
All three active candidates -- Democrat John K. Van de Kamp, state attorney 
general; Democrat Dianne Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco, and 
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson -- are perceived to be pro-choice. So, all things 
being equal, abortion should have little impact on the race. But all things are 
never equal. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson hopes to use the "crime victims justice reform initiative," proposed for 
the June, 1990, ballot, to establish a tough anti-crime image. But Van de Kamp 
insists that right-to-privacy limits in the initiative could be used to 
undermine a woman's right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, rather than staking out a popular perch for his November campaign, 
Wilson may have to spend the months before the June election defending his 
pro-choice credentials, constantly reminding GOP conservatives that he's not 
with them and reminding staunch pro-choicers that he's not quite pure. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no guarantee that the issue won't come back to haunt the attorney 
general. Because of Van de Kamp's opposition to the initiative, his linking of 
abortion to privacy is being met with skepticism. Opponent Feinstein lashed out 
at people who would "cynically . . . pit women who want the right to an 
abortion against crime victims." 
</P>
<P>
There are other forces that would argue against the dominance of the abortion 
issue. Ask Dianne Feinstein. A strong candidate, she should be benefiting from 
visibility, pro-choice organization and money. But her campaign is reeling from 
the resignation of her campaign manager in the face of lagging fund-raising and 
opinion poll numbers. 
</P>
<P>
One legislative strategist argued that, for 1990, "Both pro-choice and pro-life 
-- like the NRA -- must target the Legislature because that's where the law is 
changed. They can't waste their resources on the governor's race." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly if there is an impact, it should be in the state legislative races. But 
in California the reality is that most seats are safe for one party or the 
other. There have been instances where a legislative incumbent has been ousted 
over a single issue. But it's difficult to change a pro-life vote, or a 
pro-choice vote, in a general election in California unless the contest is for 
an open seat -- as it is in the 76th district, or party registration is close 
enough to allow a swing. There just aren't many of those races. 
</P>
<P>
In legislative primaries and where other contests exist, or can be created, 
things can change. Where abortion is the motivating issue, change is more 
threatening to the GOP because of the demographics of who Republican voters 
are. 
</P>
<P>
In California, candidates usually emerge from the "extremes" of the parties -- 
and the conservatives who dominate Republican primaries and the party apparatus 
are solidly pro-life. Before the Webster decision, one analyst said, the 
Republicans got the pro-life vote "without paying a penalty to the pro-choice 
part of their constituency." No more. 
</P>
<P>
When a rights issue is to be decided, it is the group whose rights are most 
threatened that mobilizes. The demographics of who turns out to vote on 
abortion underscores how damaging the fight can be for California's 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"The pro-choicers are concentrating on this issue much more than they have 
been, because for the first time they're most seriously threatened," Van 
Lohuizen said, "so the incentive to vote on this issue and this issue alone has 
become much greater for the pro-choicers than the pro-lifers." 
</P>
<P>
According to another Republican analyst, "The people who clearly feel most 
strongly about pro-choice tend to be upper-income, better educated women. And 
those people are not found in Democratic districts, they're found in Republican 
districts." 
</P>
<P>
The activity of these single-issue voters may lead to some reregistration and 
may create a new group of ticket-splitters, as young, upwardly mobile women who 
usually vote Republican, or don't vote, shift to the Democratic column to vote 
pro-choice. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Democrats have already lost the pro-lifers, who have been 
voting Republican for some time. For Democrats, the issue may not be as 
divisive or as damaging at election time. 
</P>
<P>
Before placing an abortion initiative on the ballot, pro-lifers should be 
cautious. Here, as in legislative elections, the group most at risk will turn 
out. The fear of a gun-control initiative, placed on the 1982 ballot by 
liberals hoping to bring out the Bradley-for-governor vote, turned out the 
rural, conservative, pro-gun vote and helped give Republican George Deukmejian 
his narrow victory margin. A pro-life amendment could mobilize low-turnout 
voters on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the state's political culture and its political system -- marked by 
entrenched incumbents, made nearly invulnerable by status-quo reapportionment 
and an iniquitous system of campaign funding -- the abortion issue may not have 
a decisive impact on 1990 elections. 
</P>
<P>
Of greater significance, perhaps, the abortion debate, like gun control, has 
shown Republican leaders to be out of step with mainstream California. The 
shift in public opinion on these issues can erode GOP electoral power in a 
state where the party's fortunes depend on Republican loyalty and Democratic 
disaffection. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson for all California politicians is that there is a risk in misreading 
public sentiment on issues like abortion. Lawmakers need to pay attention to 
their constituencies. Ultimately, they cannot escape hard, social choices by 
hiding under the bell jar of the Capitol dome.

No column, commentary or Sunday morning sound bite on Washington's wave of 
scandals explains the underlying dynamic more clearly than the sage words of a 
Southern demagogue. Willie Stark whispered them to his reluctant protege Jack 
Burden in "All The King's Men," Robert Penn Warren's classic 1946 novel of 
political ambition and corruption. "There is always something," Stark said, 
sending Burden off to find scandal rotting in the past of a seemingly upright 
opponent. "Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption . . . . There is 
always something." 
</P>
<P>
Almost daily the headlines honor Stark (or, more accurately, Penn Warren) as a 
bilious prophet. This year's parade of political and personal scandals has 
offered "something" for everyone: politicians apparently enriching themselves 
with special favors from wealthy supporters; lobbyists enriching themselves by 
wiring federal grants at the Department of Housing and Urban Development; House 
members of all ideological and sexual persuasions -- from liberal homosexual 
Barney Frank (D-Mass.) to conservative heterosexual Donald E. Lukens (R-Ohio) 
-- enmeshing themselves in grimy webs of lapsed morality. All this after the 
indiscretions of Gary Hart, the investigations of Edwin Meese III and the 
rejection of John G. Tower. We may be nearing a point where the most useful 
capital directory might be one compiled by Masters and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
All this takes a predictable toll on the public view of politicians. Trust in 
Congress and other national institutions, including the Supreme Court, has 
eroded under the acid drip of revelation. In California, having endured federal 
and local investigations of the Legislature and the questionable financial 
dealings of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, more than 40% of residents surveyed 
in a recent Field poll said they did not consider local and state politicians 
honest. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean today's elected officials are more venal, more corrupt than 
their predecessors? Probably not. Remember, there is always something. No code 
of conduct has ever repealed the immutable law of human imperfection. What 
makes current scandals so notorious is intensified press coverage -- plus a 
lack of offsetting good works in the political ledger. Washington has been 
defined by its scandals largely because it has offered so little else to define 
itself. In Sacramento the same has been true. Along with the sense that 
government is corrupt and immoral comes a belief that it is incapable of 
grappling with basic problems. 
</P>
<P>
That widespread disaffection corrodes government's ability to function -- and 
virtually invites more scandal. As people have lost faith in governmental good 
works, they have both demanded less of it and given it less attention. With 
politics receiving less attention, campaigns increasingly turn on tactical 
advantage -- which side can mobilize more money to rush a fleeting message past 
a distracted electorate. Squeezing money from special interests -- whose needs 
breed scandal like swamp flies -- becomes the first order of political 
survival. In 1988, the candidate who spent more won 414 of the 435 House races, 
and 29 of the 33 Senate races, according to exhaustive research by the Center 
for Responsive Politics. 
</P>
<P>
As those numbers suggest, few candidates have found issues compelling enough to 
overcome financial disadvantage. Concern about ethics isn't likely to change 
that. Individual members implicated may face problems next fall, but there's no 
sign of a wave developing to flush the rascals out. Polls show that voters 
don't give either party any edge for ethical rectitude. The conviction that all 
politicians are dirty dilutes the political force of the accompanying disgust. 
</P>
<P>
"This might contribute to some kind of greater anti-incumbent sentiment," said 
GOP pollster William McInturff, "but I'm not even sure of that because people 
may not believe the next round of challengers are any different." 
</P>
<P>
Yet elected officials are eager to further inoculate themselves. Talk of ethics 
reform is rampant in Congress; how much reform is another matter. The Senate is 
drafting an ethics package; the House is likely to take up ethics reform by 
mid-October, and perhaps also consider further campaign finance restrictions. 
Yet the most eagerly sought ethics change, a ban on honorariums from special 
interests, will be difficult to achieve without a pay raise, a fight many 
legislators may not wish to revisit. Major campaign finance reform is unlikely 
because there is no consensus behind public financing, the key to imposing 
spending limits. "We are pretty much dead in the water on that," said Rep. Vic 
Fazio (D-Sacramento), who heads a bipartisan House task force studying ethics 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the state Assembly is expected to join the Senate in passing a 
substantial package of reforms later this month, including restrictions on 
honorariums and gifts, and new controls on the use of campaign funds for 
personal benefit. Attorney General John K. Van de Kamp, front-runner for the 
Democratic gubernatorial nomination, wants to put a much more ambitious package 
before the voters, one limiting state legislators to 12 years in office. Among 
politicians the idea is anathema. For that reason alone, it may prove extremely 
popular with voters. 
</P>
<P>
All these changes could be salutary; approved, they would probably diminish 
public belief that government is bought. But they won't eliminate mistrust 
altogether, because such reforms by themselves can't end the gridlock that 
symbolizes government's breakdown. Ethics rules alone can't solve the problems 
that create the demand for them. 
</P>
<P>
More than the paralyzing influence of special-interest money has tied up both 
Congress and the state Legislature. Government is not moving boldly at any 
level; few politicians have a clear sense of where they want to take it. After 
lively debates on government's role in the early Reagan years, Washington is in 
a period of pause. Through the first eight months of the Bush Administration, 
neither party has shown much ideological passion. 
</P>
<P>
Having abandoned Reagan's anti-government bromides, Bush has only replaced them 
with the pragmatic problem-solving he ridiculed during the campaign. And 
Democrats have been remarkably reticent about confronting Bush, uncertain about 
their own identity after the third straight presidential blowout. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in politics is static. As in science, the observation of a phenomenon 
changes it. As politicians are accused of being frozen and ineffective, they 
instinctively bustle. Some signs are encouraging. Many observers, for example, 
believe criticism of the California Legislature's inaction helps explain the 
compromise reached over gasoline taxes and the current willingness to consider 
serious ethical reforms. "Legislators are finally getting a real sense of the 
low regard in which the public holds them. And I think they are fairly 
uncomfortable with that," said Walter Zelman, executive director of California 
Common Cause. The uncharacteristic boldness of an achingly conventional 
officeholder like Van de Kamp may foreshadow changing times. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the new Democratic leaders in Congress, well aware of the damage to 
their reputations from the Jim Wright and Tony Coelho scandals -- and more 
recently from the misadventures of a male prostitute attached to Frank's office 
-- are anxious to present a more purposeful image. "If we don't do anything 
between now and November, 1990, then there is a vacuum," acknowledged one 
senior aide in the House Democratic leadership. "On the other hand, if we pass 
a clean-air bill, if we pass a child-care bill, and we do something in terms of 
oil-spill legislation, about education, we do something about drugs, then I 
think people will feel we're getting some things done." 
</P>
<P>
That analysis rings true. As long as both parties are mired in tactical debates 
and incremental tinkering with the edges of fundamental needs, scandal will cut 
more deeply. 
</P>
<P>
In politics, there is always something corrupt; the issue is whether there is 
also something inspiring or ennobling to balance the picture. In small times, 
even small lapses loom large.

BOTH SIDES IN AFRICA'S LONGEST WAR LOOK FOR PEACEFUL SOLUTION IN ATLANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tom Killion, Tom Killion, an artist and historian, is working on a book 
about Eritrea. He was administrator of a medical relief program for Eritrean 
refugees in the Sudan in 1987-88.

<P>
In what must be one of the more unlikely locales for such a meeting, 
representatives of the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean People's 
Liberation Front (EPLF) will come to America's Deep South this week to begin 
preliminary negotiations toward the settlement of Africa's longest war. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a 28-year struggle. The Eritreans seek independence for their 
former Italian colony on the Red Sea coast; the Ethiopian government, among 
many considerations, is intent on preserving its access to the sea. Conflict 
has exacerbated the effects of recurrentfamines in northern Ethiopia and 
produced an estimated 700,000 Eritrean refugees and killed half a million 
people since 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Until this summer, all attempts to bring the two sides into direct negotiations 
had failed because of their intransigent positions. The negotiations starting 
Thursday in Atlanta are the result of a drastically altered military situation 
in Eritrea and the tireless shuttle diplomacy of former President Jimmy Carter, 
whose International Negotiation Network, based in the Carter Center at Emory 
University, will provide the forum for the first round of peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Starting last January, Carter talked repeatedly with Ethiopia's President 
Mengistu Haile Mariam and Isseyas Aferworki, general secretary of the EPLF. 
Aferworki, visiting the United States in May, stressed the EPLF's desire to 
seek a political settlement overseen by a third party. Carter returned to 
Ethiopia in late July and obtained Mengistu's approval for the Atlanta 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"The parties cannot win through continued war, but both sides can win a 
negotiated settlement," the former President said. 
</P>
<P>
For several years the EPLF has sought a negotiated settlement to the war 
through an internationally supervised referendum on Eritrea's political future. 
One model they cite is a Zimbabwe plebiscite, organized in large part by the 
Carter Administration during the late 1970s. But until this summer, Mengistu 
was unwilling to negotiate publicly with the rebel organization. He has been 
shoved to the bargaining table by a series of events that began in March, 1988, 
when the EPLF destroyed a third of the Ethiopian army in Eritrea at the battle 
of Afabet, capturing massive quantities of Soviet-supplied weaponry and forcing 
the Ethiopians to abandon the western half of Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
The debacle at Afabet was followed by further Ethiopian defeats in Eritrea and 
neighboring Tigre province, where the Tigre People's Liberation Front (TPLF) by 
this March had driven Mengistu's armies from the entire province, including the 
crucial Soviet-built air base at Mekeller. These military disasters produced a 
coup attempt against Mengistu in mid-May, organized by the commanding generals 
of the Ethiopian army. 
</P>
<P>
Though the coup was foiled after heavy fighting in the Eritrean capital of 
Asmara, the attempt demonstrated the army's disillusionment with Mengistu's 
policy of "Everything to the War Front." In their radio broadcasts, coup 
leaders called for a "peace dialogue" toward a negotiated settlement of the 
war. Then, in the aftermath of the coup, the call for negotiations was taken up 
by the Ethiopian Shengo -- the national Parliament that in the past served as a 
rubber stamp for Mengistu's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The Shengo call for unconditional talks, accepting the EPLF demand for public 
negotiations, reflected Mengistu's weak position following the failed coup. 
That action decimated the Ethiopian officer corps -- more than 200 high-ranking 
officers were arrested and eight leading generals executed. Perhaps the crucial 
point is that Mengistu has been subjected to mounting pressure from the Soviet 
Union to negotiate with the EPLF. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1978 the Soviets, with their Cuban and East German allies, have been the 
principal supplier of arms and military advisers to the Ethiopians. In return, 
they were allowed to build a naval base in Eritrea's Dahlak archipelago. Today, 
however, as Mikhail S. Gorbachev leads a reappraisal of Soviet military 
commitments around the world, the level of support demanded by Mengistu has 
begun to look increasingly like an anachronism from the discredited Brezhnev 
era -- particularly in view of the disastrous failures of Mengistu's military 
and economic programs during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
During Mengistu's visit to Moscow in July, 1988, Gorbachev reportedly told the 
Ethiopian leader that "our unqualified military and economic commitment cannot 
continue much further." As settlements to the conflicts in Afghanistan and 
Angola have moved forward during the past year, Mengistu's intransigent 
attitude placed him increasingly at odds with Gorbachev's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Soviets did resupply the Ethiopian army with the large 
quantities of heavy weapons lost at Afabet, and the EPLF reports that in recent 
months the Ethiopians have received new shipments. Soviet arms supply both 
sides in the Eritrean war, for the EPLF relies almost entirely on captured 
Ethiopian weapons. The Soviets are consequently in a position to apply a great 
deal of pressure on both sides to negotiate a political settlement but -- 
perhaps because of their involvement -- they have been unable or unwilling to 
arrange peace negotiations themselves. An invisible Soviet hand must, however, 
be recognized in the success of Carter's shuttle diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that Jimmy Carter should bring the warring sides to the 
negotiating table, for it was Carter who decided to cut U.S. military aid to 
Mengistu following the Ethiopian revolution. That decision paved the way for 
Soviet intervention in support of Mengistu's avowedly Marxist government during 
1978. The Eritreans argue that had it not been for this Soviet intervention, 
they might have established an independent government in Eritrea during 1978, 
because the withdrawal of U.S. military aid -- provided largely as "rent" for 
the use of a military communications base in the Eritrean capital -- left the 
Ethiopian army powerless to stop the Eritrean guerrillas' advance. 
</P>
<P>
The true situation, however, was far more complicated. During the 1970s the 
Eritreans were divided into a number of rival political organizations, each 
with its own guerrilla army. Their disunity left them isolated internationally 
and weakened militarily. Only in the early 1980s, after a bitter civil war 
fought simultaneously with a series of massive Ethiopian offensives, was the 
EPLF able to drive its rivals into the Sudan and assume complete leadership of 
the independence struggle inside Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
In the West, and particularly in the United States, Ethiopia is no longer 
regarded merely as another domino in an overarching East-West conflict. Now 
Ethiopia is viewed as the scene of an immense human tragedy, exacerbated by the 
continuation of the Eritrean war. The stage is thus set for a possible solution 
to the conflict and, with it, a possible end to the cyclic war-famine in 
northern Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
But while the superpowers may hope for a peaceful resolution, specific regional 
considerations that have fueled this bitter war for almost three decades still 
remain. For example, if Eritrea were to become independent, how would Ethiopia 
be guaranteed access to the sea? In particular, what would be the status of 
Assab -- Addis Ababa's main port, the site of Ethiopia's only oil refinery and 
a city separated from the rest of Eritrea by 200 miles of the hottest desert in 
the world? And if Eritrea were to return to the autonomous status granted by 
the United Nations in 1952, what would guarantee that it would not once again 
be annexed by the far larger Ethiopian state, as happened in 1962? 
</P>
<P>
With so much blood spilled between them, will the Eritrean and Ethiopian 
leaders finally be able to face the compromises necessary to settle their 
conflict? So many questions. Perhaps some answers will emerge this week in 
Atlanta. One thing is certain: The people of Eritrea and Ethiopia desperately 
need and desire peace.

WANTED: 4 MORE ACTS OF COURAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this year, when Gov. George Deukmejian signed into law the nation's 
first statewide ban on military-style assault weapons, he put the people's 
welfare ahead of his own ideological predilections and his strong partisan 
attachments. His decision was an act of political courage we hope he will match 
when, as seems likely, four critical pieces of firearms legislation reach his 
desk later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost among these is AB 497, which was introduced by Lloyd G. Connelly 
(D-Sacramento). The measure, which already has passed the Assembly, goes before 
the Senate Appropriations Committee next week and it is expected to win quick 
passage there and on the chamber's floor. The Connelly proposal would extend 
the current 15-day interval between the purchase of a handgun and its delivery 
to all sales of all firearms. That brief, two-week wait would allow the 
Department of Justice to ensure that the buyer is not a person prohibited from 
gun ownership under the terms of the bill. These would include people found 
mentally infirm under law, convicted felons, those found guilty of certain 
violent misdemeanors within the previous 10 years and individuals prohibited 
from possessing a weapon as a condition of probation. 
</P>
<P>
AB 497 is supported by every major law-enforcement agency in the state. Its 
provisions are so self-evidently reasonable that its only opponents are 
lawmakers so cowed by the political power of the professional gun lobby that we 
are left to suppose that if Hezbollah had a direct-mail operation, these 
legislators would vote against bans on kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Two measures by Democratic Assemblyman Johan Klehs of Castro Valley also demand 
quick Senate passage and gubernatorial signatures. One, AB 376, would forbid 
the sale of detachable magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds. The 
other, AB 565, would ban military-style shotguns with rotary or detachable 
magazines capable of holding more than five shells. Similarly worthy is AB 
1680, which was introduced by Democrat Rusty Areias of Los Banos. It advances 
the inarguable suggestion that anyone purchasing a handgun be required to 
complete a basic two-hour safety course.

Spin is merely another word for bias, something journalists pretend they don't 
have. Bias is nothing new; it's just more uniform and more obvious these days, 
thanks to poorly educated reporters and editors. 
</P>
<P>
And since these fledgling reporters have no sense of history, today is the 
beginning of mankind for them. 
</P>
<P>
That's why they're so gullible, so addicted to socialistic causes, and so naive 
as the think anyone cares about their shallow opinions.

TOBACCO TAX

In his letter printed Aug. 11, A.J. Tobias delights in his circumvention of the 
state tobacco tax, gloating that "the creators of the tobacco tax must think we 
smokers are a bunch of dum-dums." 
</P>
<P>
Smoking has been proven to cause cancer, emphysema and birth defects and is the 
leading cause of preventable death in the country. Each time a smoker lights 
up, be it a cigarette, cigar or pipe, he has proven himself to be the dum-dum 
indeed.

THE PRESS AND 'GROUP-THINK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is ironic that David Shaw's articles on the narrowness of the press (Aug. 
24, 26) illustrated and reaffirmed exactly such narrowness. Dan Rather, David 
Broder, Robert Novak and so on hardly span a range of views. Shaw centers on 
the personalities and group-think psychology which characterize the media in 
this country, avoiding far more important issues of media bias and 
concentration of media ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The recent mergers between corporate giants such as Time and Warner 
Communications, and General Electric's purchase of NBC, evidence the more 
fundamental problem with the media in this country. The same conservative 
corporate interests which marble the rest of our political and economic life 
own and operate the major television, radio, and newspaper organizations in 
this country. Given this effectively monolithic corporate ownership, the issues 
raised by Shaw become inconsequential. 
</P>
<P>
The individuals who work in the media, for any number of apparently disparate 
reasons (not just the factors Shaw focused on), will ultimately report and 
discuss only a narrow range of issues; issues thought appropriate to a small 
group of corporate people, mostly male, white and middle-aged. Shaw only 
focused on the pawns in the game, leaving the major players in the background.

HAMMER'S ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I write this letter as counsel to the Board of Directors of Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. in response to "Occidental, Not Hammer's Foundation, Purchased 
Art" (Part I, Aug. 18). 
</P>
<P>
You imply that Dr. (Armand) Hammer somehow unjustly benefits from his own 
philanthropy. This is wrong. Occidental and Dr. Hammer have a long-established 
history of promoting artistic and cultural endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Dr. Hammer and the Armand Hammer Foundation have loaned priceless 
masterpieces the world over, generating enormous good will to Occidental's 
benefit. Last year, Occidental decided that this good will could be perpetuated 
by establishing and funding an art museum and cultural center adjoining 
Occidental's headquarters in Westwood Village. Accordingly, an independent 
special committee of Occidental's board of directors unanimously voted to make 
a one-time charitable contribution for this purpose. The building housing the 
museum will be named the "Occidental Petroleum Cultural Center Building." The 
museum will be named for Occidental's chief executive officer and founder, Dr. 
Armand Hammer, who has contractually agreed to transfer to the museum all his 
art works, appraised at over $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some have incorrectly asserted that Dr. Hammer did not pay for the art that he 
and the Armand Hammer Foundation will donate to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, Dr. Hammer has donated over $45 million of his own funds 
to the Armand Hammer Foundation. All but the Leonardo da Vinci Codex Hammer and 
10 other works of art contained in the art collections to be donated to the 
museum have been fully paid for by Dr. Hammer -- either directly or by funds 
contributed by him to the Armand Hammer Foundation. Occidental has donated a 
total of $12 million to the Armand Hammer Foundation. Of that sum, 
approximately $5 million was used for the purchase of the Codex Hammer and 
$500,000 was used for the purchase of the 10 other paintings. Thus, virtually 
all of the art to be donated to the museum has been paid for by Dr. Hammer 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Dr. Hammer personally contributed $1 million in cash and paintings 
then worth an additional $1 million (which today are worth more than 20 times 
what they cost) to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which resulted in the 
naming of a building in his honor. Occidental's contribution of $2 million to 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the construction of a bridge and 
escalator has been recognized by a suitable plaque.

Welcome to the California Department of Insurance. The ocean of paper before 
you was created last June when 460 insurance companies applied for exemptions 
from the 20% rollback in auto and other casuality rates required by Proposition 
103. 
</P>
<P>
This tidal wave was, of course, the result of the state Supreme Court's 
decision upholding the insurance-reform initiative. To meet the constitutional 
requirement that insurers be given the opportunity to earn a fair profit, the 
court modified the rate rollback. An insurer who claimed its rolled-back rates 
would be unconstitutionally low, the court said, need not reduce those rates 
until the state insurance commissioner ruled on the claim. 
</P>
<P>
The companies responded with a flood of paper. How can a department that has 
about one employee per insurance company seriously evaluate this sea of 
self-serving claims? 
</P>
<P>
The answer would be for the insurance commissioner to identify the fundamental 
issues common to the applications and to resolve them together in a 
consolidated hearing -- a logical solution to regulatory overload that has long 
been approved by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
In July I proposed a framework for such hearings, based on the fundamental 
structure of the insurance business. Insurance rates are supposed to raise 
money for three basic functions: payouts on insurance claims from accidents, 
internal expenses such as overhead and profits. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, few of the applications for exemptions admit to excessive 
profits. In fact, the companies often claim that they're losing money and have 
been doing so for years. 
</P>
<P>
To cut through such assertions, one must look at the payouts. Insurers are 
basing their claims not on the dollars actually paid, but on their 
"projections" of future payouts. To support higher rates, the company simply 
projects sharply higher payouts. If the projections never materialize, that's 
just extra profit for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie must therefore develop her own 
projections, based on actual historical payouts and adjusted for any new 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 was intended not only to stamp out excessive profits, but also 
to trim the waste and inefficiency of a moribund industry sheltered by 
special-interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
The average auto insurer spends about 35 cents of every premium dollar on 
internal expenses. But some spend as little as 20 cents or much as 45 cents -- 
with no perceptible difference in service. The U.S. Constitution protects the 
opportunity of an efficient company to earn a profit; it does not permit a 
profligate company simply to spend as much as it likes and send the bill to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
I have urged the commissioner to set efficiency standards for internal 
expenses. Where several insurers have demonstrated that insurance can be 
provided economically, internal expenses higher than those firms' expense 
levels should be disallowed in rates. 
</P>
<P>
Profit, the third component of rates, can similarly be dealt with 
categorically. A company is entitled to an opportunity to earn a fair return on 
the stockholders' investment that is actually being used to provide insurance. 
Some companies refuse to write as much insurance as they have the financial 
capacity to provide. Those companies should not be paid a profit byinsurance 
consumers for equity they refuse to devote to the insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner can establish a formula to determine how much equity each 
company is using, then deny a profit on any greater amount. 
</P>
<P>
In July I filed with the commissioner a detailed plan for rapidly resolving 
these fundamental issues -- a road map to the rollbacks. Gillespie rejected 
that proposal, claiming that each of the applications filed by 460 companies 
must be evaluated separately. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while rejecting hearings to develop general rules, Gillespie announced 
general criteria of her own -- adopted without any public hearings -- and 
proposed to grant the exemptions for all but 47 of the 460 companies on the 
basis of her unwritten rules. 
</P>
<P>
No announced scrutiny of inflated payout projections. No nod to the need to 
trim bloated expenses. No visible signs of any regulation. It's as if 
Proposition 103 had never been passed. 
</P>
<P>
Taking no chances, a number of us whose job it is to represent consumers filed 
formal demands for hearings on another 237 companies. Forced by the law to 
grant those hearings, the commissioner consigned the 237 -- including three of 
the four largest auto insurers in the state -- to a "slow track" and predicted 
that it would take 10 years to decide those cases. Because we have now blocked 
the automatic exemptions of those companies from the rollbacks, there is still 
time to right the regulatory ship. 
</P>
<P>
Only a prompt course correction can save our rollbacks and guarantee a fair 
adjudication of the insurance company claims.

A NEW FACE SHOWS HIS TRUE COLORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDALL ROBINSON, Randall Robinson is executive director of TransAfrica, an 
anti-apartheid organization based in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The unadorned violence that South African security forces have unleashed on 
peaceful anti-apartheid protesters in recent weeks is a reminder that, despite 
all his talk about reform and negotiation, the priority of the country's new 
leader, Frederik W. de Klerk, is the perpetuation of white-minority control. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, a longtime National Party leader from conservative Transvaal 
province, has worked diligently to provide apartheid with tempered rhetoric and 
a smiling visage. He has sought to improve South Africa's international image 
by traveling to neighboring countries and meeting with his counterparts 
including, most recently, President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia. Unfortunately, De 
Klerk has yet to provide his unpopular regime with an alternative to violent 
suppression of the aspirations of black South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's parliamentary elections -- from which blacks, who constitute more 
than 75% of the population, are excluded -- have provided the catalyst for 
renewed mass protests throughout the country. This has suprised many 
well-meaning people who hope that the National Party will win,presuming that De 
Klerk would be more supportive of fundamental change than his predecessor. This 
hope is, sadly, misplaced. Of all the potential successors to former President 
Pieter W. Botha, none was more conservative than De Klerk. Those who have read 
too much from his demeanor and vague statements and are moved to urge a 
relaxation of the international pressure on South Africa overlook De Klerk's 
long career, including his years as head of the interior and education 
ministries. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of this week's election holds little relevance to the black people 
of South Africa since the elections merely determine who gets the opportunity 
to oppress them. The solicitude with which so many people discuss the present 
electoral difficulties of De Klerk's party is disturbing, given its history in 
matters of race and equality. It is certainly not too much to ask that more 
concern be expressed for the worsening state of the victims of apartheid during 
the current crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
In order to gain favor with the white electorate, De Klerk has ordered one of 
the severest crackdowns on protesters in recent history. Observers, including 
foreign diplomats, have commented on the eagerness with which the police, using 
tear gas, water hoses, whips, clubs and bullets, have moved to disperse and 
disrupt peaceful demonstrations. There have been mass arrests conducted 
violently without provocation. Archbishop Desmond Tutu was tear-gassed minutes 
after he had persuaded youths to call off a march to a police station; on 
Friday, he was arrested while en route to protest the beating of clergymen at 
an earlier demonstration. The general secretary of the anti-apartheid United 
Democratic Front, Mohammed Valli Moosa, Archbishop Tutu's wife, Leah, and 
Dorothy Boesak, wife of UDF co-founder the Rev. Allan Boesak, are among others 
who have been arrested. Several activists have gone underground, afraid not 
only of arrest but also of assassination by vigilante groups. 
</P>
<P>
The escalating repression has sparked criticism of De Klerk's policies from 
many quarters. Curiously, the Bush Administration has not been one of them. 
Though South Africa is experiencing a level of repression far exceeding 
anything experienced by Solidarity in Poland, the Administration cannot find 
the courage to chastise the South African regime. Indeed, even the limited 
response by the Administration to the crushing of the democratic movement in 
China has been missing in this case. 
</P>
<P>
In light of such silence by our chief executive, it is now up to the American 
people and Congress to express our outrage and to work for a better South 
Africa. Our goal should be the rapid dismantling of apartheid and nothing less. 
De Klerk should be judged not by what he says, but by what he actually does.

WHAT COLOMBIA NEEDS, MONEY CAN'T BUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. KURZ, Robert J. Kurz is a guest scholar at the Brookings 
Institution in Washington and a Council on Foreign Relations international 
affairs fellow. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Colombian government's bubble of complacency with the drug cartels has 
finally broken. It was burst by the bullet that took the life of presidential 
candidate Luis Carlos Galan. 
</P>
<P>
It is not news that there are powerful drug cartels operating out of Colombia, 
doing billions of dollars worth of business in the international cocaine trade. 
Nor is it news that the drug lords have used murder and intimidation to work 
their will on the Colombian legal system; dozens of judges and other officials 
have been murdered. What is new in Colombia is that the government has finally 
decided to stand up for Colombian sovereignty. In ways that have not been seen 
in recent history, the voices of the people and the muscle of the government 
have been galvanized into a force that has done real damage to the operations 
of the cocaine cartels. 
</P>
<P>
What is worth remembering is that Colombia has always had the resources to 
attack the cartel and its assets. It is not a banana republic, nor a small 
island in the Caribbean. Colombia's 31 million people support a combined 
military and national police force that totals 141,000. Those forces have a 
reputation for being modern and professional; they have at their disposal, 
among other things, more than 250 aircraft and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Even with such resources, the Colombians do not face an easy task. The cartels 
have made their way into the economic life of Colombia and its Andean 
neighbors. They have exploited an incredibly lucrative weakness in U.S. society 
which has made them literally billions of dollars. And they have a wanton 
disregard for the life of anyone who gets in their way. 
</P>
<P>
Now they have responded to the latest government crackdown with a declaration 
of war. There have been daily bombings in the city of Medellin and in the 
capital and threats of new assassinations -- this time against business and 
media leaders as well as government and police figures. The people of Colombia 
have had ample evidence of what they have to fear. 
</P>
<P>
Will they and the government have the perseverance to see the job through? We 
all know that strength of political convictions can vanish as quickly as it 
develops, particularly in the face of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
President Virgilio Barco Vargas has demonstrated his decency and courage in 
recent days. In his television address last week, which was aimed at the United 
States, he said, "Colombia's survival as the oldest democracy in Latin America 
is now at risk." He is not overstating the case. Colombian democracy faces a 
dangerous and determined enemy at a time when its political system is in 
tatters. Out of fear, or corruption, the Colombian Congress has not supported 
the military offensive against the drug lords -- in fact, it has never fully 
supported anti-drug efforts. Barco's own attorney general has not been willing 
to say that the current presidential decrees against the cartel are legal. 
</P>
<P>
The risk for Colombian democracy, and as Barco said, "for the safety of your 
(U.S.) streets," is not lost on the Bush Administration. President Bush 
promptly used two special emergency authorities to order $65 million in aid for 
the Colombian military and police. The move is likely to receive widespread 
support, but this military aid alone is not going to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
We should remember that the people of Colombia, like most Latin Americans, are 
extraordinarily sensitive when it comes to the presence of the U.S. military. A 
perception of a heavy U.S. hand is something that the drug cartel could turn to 
its advantage with the people of Colombia. We should recall that President 
Reagan used similar emergency authorities to provide the initial elements of 
U.S. military aid to the government of El Salvador. El Salvador is a much 
smaller country, with a population that is about one-fifth that of Colombia's. 
In the last decade the United States has provided the government of El Salvador 
with $3 billion in aid, without seeing a military defeat of the guerrillas or a 
peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The real challenge for the United States is to recognize that the change in 
Colombia could be a historic turning point. Or it could merely be an 
interruption in the drug cartels' business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Finding ways to encourage and nourish the newly born political determination in 
Colombia is essential. Backing the government in its life-or-death struggle 
will certainly require more of a commitment than we have made to date. And the 
success or failure of efforts to reduce the American demand for cocaine will 
have a significant impact upon Colombia. But in the final analysis, it will be 
the Colombians who must find the strength to face this threat. It is critical 
for both the United States and Colombia that the bullet that took the life of 
Luis Galan brings to life a renewed commitment to blunt the power of the 
cartels that have brought so much misery to North and South America.

OFFERING COMPASSION TO THE VICTIMS OF AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The predicament of Elizabeth Glaser and her family's struggle with the AIDS 
virus is heartbreaking, and her advocacy work for AIDS funding and research is 
courageous and commendable. But a very telling quote in the recent View article 
on the Glasers came from Sandy Brock, wife of Reagan's former Secretary of 
Labor Bill Brock: "She has (the AIDS virus), but she isn't black, she isn't 
poor, she isn't homosexual, she isn't a drug user. She is 'like the rest of 
us.' " (emphasis mine). 
</P>
<P>
What Brock perhaps unwittingly suggests is that because Glaser is a non-black, 
non-gay member of a privileged upper-middle class, her plight is somehow more 
worthy of attention and sympathy than, say, the homeless minority mother dying 
on the streets or the gay son or father, afflicted by the virus, his financial 
resources depleted while facing social discrimination that includes the highest 
incidence of "gay bashing" in the past several decades. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS has disenfranchised many groups of people, and the roots of this lie in 
attitudes like Brock's, people who can only "confront our anger and our 
prejudices and start doing something" when an acceptable role martyr like 
Glaser is presented. 
</P>
<P>
This social stratification of society, where a fatal virus isn't worthy of 
attention until it shows up in the white, heterosexual, drug-free 
neighborhoods, is one of the reasons too many government and medical officials 
dragged their heels in the initial phases of the AIDS crises until it was too 
late and we were confronted with the worst public health catastrophe of the 
late 20th Century, one that took away the Glasers' daughter. A compassionate, 
concerned awareness of those whom AIDS affects must be given to all sectors of 
humanity, even if they're not always "like the rest of us."

Golly, I didn't realize that the state of Washington is becoming a private 
sector of our nation ("Welcome to Seattle . . . Now Go Home," by Ann Japenga, 
Aug. 24 ). Will we be required to have a visa to cross their border? Proof of 
inoculations? Will this apply only to Californians? If so, what actually 
constitutes a "Californian"? 
</P>
<P>
Gee, I'm third-generation, but the vast majority of people I've known and met 
weren't even born in this state. Does having a California license plate 
automatically make one a native? When did the welcome mat get trashed that was 
spread before us in 1962 when Seattle held the World's Fair? The color of our 
money hasn't changed.

It's not funny anymore. Not that they ever were. I am referring to the 
tabloids. I have just read your story, "Breaking the Silence," about the Glaser 
family and the incredible challenge brought to them by AIDS (Aug. 25). They 
have spoken with courage to Janet Huck of The Times because the tabloids are 
preparing an onslaught of cruelty against them, and they are attempting through 
honesty and responsible reporting to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The major tabloid has changed its television advertising. No longer does a 
booming baritone voice-over seriously inform us that "inquiring minds want to 
know." Instead, a lighter-hearted scene of semiattractive readers is shown 
giggling over the contents of the paper, and the voice-over has considerably 
lightened up. But it's not funny. It never has been true, and it's not funny, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
I think the tabloids are a success based upon jealousy and stupidity. Jealousy 
because only a jealous person could possibly be pleased to read distorted 
accounts of the lives of others who seem to be happy, or "have it all," or are 
living with the blessing of the double-edged sword of fame. Stupidity because 
those who buy it know it isn't true, but fork over the 50 cents anyway. That's 
stupid. That's jealous. That's inexcusable. 
</P>
<P>
The tabloid in question prints stories full of lies and distortion based upon 
personal tragedy and misunderstanding. It is the National Enquirer. Do not 
support it. DO NOT BUY IT. DO NOT BUY IT EVER AGAIN. Instead, embrace the 
Glaser family, and others like them who are not famous. Love and support them, 
and give them the respect and privacy they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty cents sent to Elizabeth Glaser's Pediatric AIDS Foundation, instead of 
wasted on such terrible trash will make a difference -- now and in the future. 
Send it, instead of spending it, to Elizabeth's Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Send 
it -- don't spend it. Send it if you were going to buy the tabloid. Send it 
even if you weren't. I will.

THE MAMBO KINGS PLAY SONGS OF LOVE BY OSCAR HIJUELOS (FARRAR, STRAUS &amp;

</P>

<P>
By Grace Edwards-Yearwood, Edwards-Yearwood's latest novel is In the Shadow of 
the Peacock (McGraw-Hill). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the late 1940s, the jazz scene from 52nd Street to Harlem blazed with the 
innovations of Charlie Parker, Miles Davis and Thelonius Monk. Be-bop was the 
language spoken in the halls of jazz. Dizzy Gillespie, introduced to Afro-Cuban 
rhythm, incorporated the sound into his music and cu-bop -- as they called it 
-- became a part of the jazz repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
But even without the help of be-bop, Latin music exploded on its own. One 
needed only to walk down 116th Street or 125th Street in Harlem to listen as 
every record shop blared the strains of Chapasau &amp; Damaron's "Anabacoa," 
the earliest mambo record to hit the charts. 
</P>
<P>
Clubs and halls from the Bronx to Brooklyn overflowed with dancers improvising 
steps to the cha-cha and in the early 1950s, this reader thought nothing of 
going to the old Broadway Palladium four nights out of seven to cheer for 
"Killer Joe" Piro whose fancy footwork captured the imagination of a 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
So it was a pleasure to read "The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love." Against this 
background of Latin and jazz, Oscar Hijuelos, a writer of considerable talent, 
introduces Nestor and Cesar Castillo, two brothers newly arrived from Batista's 
Cuba to make their way in New York's music world. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the Cuban nightclubs and casinos -- controlled by American 
gangsters, where white musicians entered through one door and mulatto and black 
musicians entered through another and the pay was wretched for all -- offered 
no future. 
</P>
<P>
Told in a series of flashbacks through the eyes of Cesar, the older brother, 
this story bares two dramatic struggles: of Nestor, who loved too much, and 
Cesar, who never learned how. 
</P>
<P>
The story opens with Cesar, now a physical and emotional wreck at age 64, holed 
up in a small room in the seedy Hotel Splendour on 125th Street in Harlem, the 
scene of many of his past rendezvous. He has brought with him a battered cane 
suitcase containing some old recordings, faded photos, and letters -- mementos 
from his glory days as the Mambo King. He has also brought a huge quantity of 
whiskey with which he plans to drink himself to quick and merciful death rather 
than continue to suffer the ravages of end-stage congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
The first quarter of the novel is crammed with more than enough information to 
satisfy any musicologist interested in the 1950s scene. This is written in an 
almost scholarly style but when Hijuelos describes the death of the legendary 
drummer, Chano Pozo, even though told thirdhand by another musician, it is a 
powerful rendering: "I remember when Chano died. I was down on 52nd Street when 
I heard the whole thing. Chano was up on 116th Street at the Caribbean Bar and 
Grill, looking for this man who'd sold him some bad stuff. That was in the 
morning. He'd injected it, gotten sick, and then later went out on the street 
looking for him. He found him in that bar, pulled a knife on him, and demanded 
his money back. Now, the man wasn't afraid of Chano and Chano wasn't afraid of 
the man; Chano had already been shot up and stabbed in Havana and had survived 
it, you know, so that Chano took his knife out and lunged at the man, even 
though he'd pulled out a gun: Chano kept coming at him because he thought the 
spirits were protecting him, but these spirits, Yoruba spirits, couldn't stop 
the bullets from tearing him up and that was that." 
</P>
<P>
Cesar and Nestor arrive in New York at a time "When every Cuban knew each 
other" and, after sitting in with other bands, decide to form their own group, 
the Mambo Kings. They play the halls and clubs and sing songs of love. The high 
point comes when they are discovered by Desi Arnaz who invites them to 
Hollywood to appear on the "I Love Lucy" show. 
</P>
<P>
Here, the description of the technical aspects of television production gets in 
the way, slowing the forward action, but this is a minor complaint because the 
characters are so skillfully rendered. The story really comes to life when 
Nestor meets Delores, a young Puerto Rican girl who works as a maid for a Park 
Avenue man "so rich he is unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
Through this relationship, we are taken via yet another flashback to Cuba, to 
an earlier love affair Nestor has had with Maria, "the beautiful Maria of my 
soul." The affair, obsessive, passionate and explicitly detailed, ends before 
the brothers emigrate but this love remains the source of Nestor's melancholia. 
</P>
<P>
By turns, Cesar reflects on his own tumultuous relationships. His short, 
unhappy marriage ended in disaster but his macho posture continued to play 
havoc with every woman he meets. While Nestor's pain is all-consuming, the 
Mambo King, as Cesar comes to be called, keeps right on going. 
</P>
<P>
The band achieves a small measure of fame -- if not fortune -- in the local 
dance halls. Hijuelos captures in poignant detail the life of the musicians: 
men who work menial, sometimes back-breaking jobs during the day and play to 
crowded dance halls at night. The life is sad, precarious, boisterous, 
exciting, and sometimes dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Night time is the glory time as they sweat through hot rumbas and mambos and 
soulful ballads, and at 3 a.m. crowd into family kitchens to feast on huge 
platters of pork chops, paella, yellow rice, fried plantains and more rum. 
</P>
<P>
It is lonely, the 4 a.m. subway rides clutching a bass fiddle or a horn and 
trying not to fall asleep or fall prey to the stick-up man. 
</P>
<P>
The story weaves back and forth in time contrasting the present Cesar, a 
swollen wreck who has taken to wearing a girdle and whose urine is now streaked 
with blood, to the young virile man of 30 years ago who was attractive to 
legions of women. 
</P>
<P>
He studies the photos and listens to the recordings of the Mambo Kings. And 
drinks. Each glass of whiskey produces more, and sadder, memories. He is 
plagued by the circumstances of Nestor's tragic death, the breakup of the band, 
the difficulty of trying to live up to a reputation he no longer deserves. 
</P>
<P>
He reminisces about his trip to Cuba and his failure to establish a 
relationship with his estranged daughter. Castro's revolution has changed 
everything and everyone; his wife has now married a high-ranking official in 
the regime and his daughter is a member of the state-sponsored ballet. 
Ideologically and emotionally, these women and everything they represent are 
now beyond his reach. He returns to New York to witness more change: the 
intrusion of a different type of music, hard drugs, more crime, the 
deterioration of a sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
And saddest of all is the change in his latest relationship with a much younger 
woman named Lydia, who tolerates him because he is generous and good to her two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The affair is initially invigorating, then gradually degenerates into scenes of 
rage, fear and jealousy as he struggles to come to terms with the fact that, 
despite his enormous sexual capacity, time has passed and he -- the Mambo King 
-- has grown old. 
</P>
<P>
Hijuelos has painted an erotic and desolate landscape where people surge to 
life and diminish with terrifying exactitude. And where macho men like Cesar -- 
handsome, proud, and mired in the disillusionment of change -- find no way out.

THE LOST CONTINENT TRAVELS IN SMALL-TOWN AMERICA BY BILL BRYSON (HARPER &amp;

By Wanda Urbanska, Urbanska, author of The Singular Generation: Young Americans 
in the 1980s (Doubleday: 1986), is co-writing a book for Viking on simplifying 
one's life.

<TEXT>
<P>
Like the proverbial vacation slide shows inflicted on polite dinner guests, 
travel books run the peculiar danger of tedium in recounting minor adventures 
and mishaps that may excite an author but are capable of putting the reader to 
sleep. These two books by Americans -- come home after years abroad to take the 
nation's pulse -- hold our attention with clever, grabby prose but fail to 
cover much new terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Both are written by gifted American journalists; Mort Rosenblum, author of 
"Back Home," is a Paris-based correspondent for the Associated Press, and Bill 
Bryson, author of "The Lost Continent," is a humor and travel writer who lives 
in Yorkshire, England. The books have much in common. Both men wander the Lower 
48 alone, searching for America's soul, trying to find (and read) meaning into 
old motels and chance encounters with policemen, waitresses and store clerks. 
Bryson sets out from his hometown of Des Moines, Iowa, in an aging Chevy 
Chevette, on loan from his mother, looking for what he terms "the perfect 
town." Rosenblum travels mostly by rental car, starting his multilegged journey 
in New York City, which he playfully dubs "The Big Fruit." 
</P>
<P>
Both visit Gatlinburg, Tenn., and are appalled by its crass commercialism and 
tacky kitsch. Both savor Savannah, Ga., where the downtown, "frozen in a 
perpetual 1959," says Bryson, remains a desirable place to live. Both tour the 
Deep South only to come away with the startling conclusion that -- hold onto 
your hats -- racial prejudice has not yet vanished. What's more, each man seeks 
out the tourist traps, as if to plumb the depths of the American character one 
must first pay homage to its celebrity icons. We see Elvis Presley's boyhood 
home in Tupelo, Miss.; Mark Twain's boyhood home in Hannibal, Mo., and Dolly 
Parton's Dollywood Amusement Park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenblum is the more serious of the two writers, attempting to follow in the 
footsteps of Alexis de Tocqueville and produce a commentary on the state of the 
nation in the late 1980s. The resulting book is a lively montage, into which 
the author laces original reportage, travelogue whimsy and information from 
sources as disparate as the Department of Defense and Spy magazine, along with 
ruminations on what ails America. Along the way, he picks the brains of family 
and friends, like the M.I.T. sociologist who is also his cousin's husband, and 
fellow journalists from around the world, now returned home. 
</P>
<P>
"America is no longer a melting pot," writes Rosenblum. "It is a stir-fry wok. 
Whatever new ingredients are added to the rest, each retains its particular 
flavor and shape. But a certain uniformity is cooked in, giving us common 
characteristics, standards and frames of reference." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenblum's own frame of reference is that of '60s-vintage liberal who, 
returning for his first serious visit after a two-decade absence, seems 
startled at the country's failures and often disappointed that things are no 
longer as they were -- or as they are now in France or the 145 foreign 
countries from which he has filed dispatches. Rosenblum takes note of, and 
takes on, such betes noires as the reign of "corporate martial law" in America, 
the ruling principle of greed on Wall Street, white poverty in Appalachia and 
our growing dependence on illegal drugs. But on his wide canvas, he seems 
determined to paint only gloomy shades. 
</P>
<P>
His perceptions run the gamut from the trenchant to the hackneyed. "The only 
phrase in America heard more often than 'Have a nice day,' is 'the bottom 
line,' " he writes, in an example of the latter. After the fashion of H. L. 
Mencken, Rosenblum relishes his role as curmudgeon (and even calls himself 
one), using the book as a forum to sound off on pet peeves, such as the 
anti-smoking campaign that has gripped America. He appears seriously troubled 
by the emergence of what he terms "health fascists," and, like a debater 
championing a losing cause, summons up dubious studies that would seem to 
dispute the dangers of passive smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even his visit to the Arizona Daily Star -- his old paper in his 
hometown of Tucson -- proves to be a "sobering" experience. "I had left a smoky 
newsroom of clattering black typewriters, where a battered old-timer from 
Chicago sneaked hits from a bottle of Jim Beam in the darkroom. I came back to 
a carpeted salon of eerie green computer screens and respectful young reporters 
nibbling trail mix. . . . The trash barrels that had smoldered when confused 
with ashtrays all were lined in clear plastic Baggies. There were no ashtrays 
at all. Funny world. In a newsroom in Warsaw you could not write what you 
wanted. But you could smoke a cigarette." 
</P>
<P>
It would appear that Rosenblum's objectivity has been stricken by an acute case 
of nostalgia. While railing against the scrub-nosed reporters who are in it for 
the paycheck -- not the glory, as in the good old days, by gum -- Rosenblum 
fails to consider the underlying conditions for these changes. The standard of 
living for the young has declined since the late '60s. Money is tighter; a 
paycheck must stretch farther. And, could our health consciousness be born of 
the declining health of the planet? He doesn't make the connection. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenblum is at his best when he arrives at a new place with an open mind and 
allows himself to be vulnerable. In one especially moving encounter, he strikes 
up an acquaintance with a Pennsylvania Dutch man, who confides his distaste for 
being on constant display. "Saying good-bye, I asked Mike if I could photograph 
him with his daughter," he writes. "He looked pained, caught between courtesy 
and disapproval of yet another jerk with a camera. 'You can take it from across 
the road, but I won't pose for you,' he said. I apologized for even suggesting 
it. And I wished I were dead." What works here is that Rosenblum has joined 
hands with the Americans he's analyzing. No longer the foreign correspondent 
from on high, he admits to wanting what they want, which is a slice of the past 
in a world overdosed on change. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bryson's "The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America" bears no 
relation to the sort of thoughtful travel writing that was so masterfully 
rendered earlier this year by V.S. Naipaul in his book, "A Turn in the South." 
To say Bryson has explored America's small towns is like equating the character 
development of "The Beverly Hillbillies" with "The Sound and the Fury." 
</P>
<P>
Though Bryson uses a search for the perfect small town as a pretext for his 
"travels," in fact, his book is merely a forum for the put-down humor so 
popular these days -- sometimes funny, often adolescent. Usually he picks on 
sitting-duck targets. 
</P>
<P>
"K-Marts are always full of the sort of people who give their children names 
that rhyme: Lonnie, Donnie, Ronnie, Connie, Bonnie. . . . Every woman there has 
at least four children and they all look as if they have been fathered by a 
different man. The woman always weighs 250 pounds. She is always walloping a 
child and bawling, 'If you don't behave, Ronnie, I'm not gonna bring you back 
here no more!' " 
</P>
<P>
He takes on the Southern accent. "The average Southerner has speech patterns of 
someone slipping in and out of consciousness. I can change my shoes and socks 
faster than most people in Mississippi can speak a sentence. Living there would 
drive me crazy. Slowly." He calls Iowa "a dump." Of Missouri, the "Show Me 
State," Bryson wonders if they didn't really mean: "Show Me the Way to Any 
Other State." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there's something funny in this put-down humor, but there's also something 
amiss: a detachment and dehumanization that fails to reach beyond stereotype. 
Bryson ever gets out of his car. The few times he does, he never interacts with 
anyone. The people he encounters are invariably dim-witted, 250-pound foils, 
walking opportunities to demonstrate his facility with the one-liner potshot. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt there is much to bemoan and much to ridicule on the American 
landscape. But, for my money, I'd rather see some digging -- even in line at 
K-Mart.

ARIEL SHARON FOR PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL; 
</P>
<P>
WARRIOR THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF ARIEL SHARON BY ARIEL SHARON (SIMON &amp;

<TEXT>
<P>
"Who's afraid of Arik Sharon?" an Israeli news magazine asked a few years ago. 
It answered its own question: "Everybody." 
</P>
<P>
In his autobiography, "Warrior," Ariel (Arik) Sharon, whose career as soldier 
and politician spans the history of modern Israel, struggles to overcome his 
reputation as a single-minded zealot who is ready to take the world to the 
brink of war -- and beyond -- to achieve his vision of Israel's national 
destiny. The man who then-Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger once called 
"the most dangerous man in the Middle East" presents himself in this book as a 
reasonable individual who, if the responsibility comes his way, can lead the 
nation to a lasting peace with its Arab adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, this is a political document. Sharon, who was forced to resign 
as defense minister in 1983 after a blue-ribbon commission determined that he 
bore "indirect responsibility" for the massacre of Palestinian civilians in the 
Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps south of Beirut, is actively maneuvering to 
become Israel's next prime minister. The autobiography must be considered part 
of a concerted campaign to refurbish his image, both inside Israel and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's next general election is not scheduled until 1992, but under the 
country's parliamentary system, it could come earlier. Sharon clearly intends 
to become a major contender for the post now held by Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
Few Israelis are neutral when it comes to Sharon. He is widely feared and even 
hated, especially by persons on the left of the country's political spectrum, 
but also by some people who generally share his political outlook. At the same 
time, he may be the most popular leader among the growing segment of the 
Israeli population that supports the right-wing Likud bloc. 
</P>
<P>
In the autobiography, ghostwritten by David Chanoff, Sharon seems to have three 
purposes. First is to give his own spin to the many controversies he has been 
embroiled in since his early days as a soldier in the Haganah, the Jewish 
militia that fought and won Israel's War of Independence in 1948. Second is to 
even scores with his Israeli political adversaries, especially Labor party 
leaders like former Prime Minister Shimon Peres and former Army Chief of Staff 
Chaim Bar Lev. And third is to assure foreigners -- and especially Americans -- 
that he is not dangerously motivated by blind hatred of Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
"(T)hough Israel is a Jewish nation it is, of course, not only a Jewish 
nation," Sharon writes. "We live here with minorities, with Druze, Bedouin, 
Circassians, and especially with (Palestinian) Arabs. . . . I begin with the 
conviction that Jews and Arabs can live together. I have repeated that at every 
opportunity, not for journalists and not for popular consumption, but because I 
have never believed differently or thought differently, from my childhood on." 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, no suggestion that Sharon would ease Israeli terms for 
peace. He makes no apology for his hard-line views or his determination to 
assure the country's security. But he is not a racist and he wants everyone to 
know that. Some of Sharon's more enthusiastic supporters are, indeed, anti-Arab 
bigots. And, despite his own apparently sincere conviction that Jews and Arabs 
can live together, there is nothing in this book to change the minds of those 
who back Sharon because they expect him to drive a hard bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Sharon, as defense minister, led the Israeli army into Lebanon in 
1982, American policy makers have been nervous about the possibility that he 
might someday become prime minister. Sharon has been trying for years to 
overcome that American concern, using such techniques as off-the-record dinners 
with American opinion makers in posh New York restaurants. Although Sharon is 
frequently critical of U.S. government policy, he realizes that U.S. support is 
vitally important to Israel's survival. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sharon provides plenty of raw meat for his hawkish supporters in 
Israel. From young soldier to defense minister, Sharon participated in all of 
the wars and most of the armed skirmishes that have marked Israel's 
strife-filled history. He describes the conflicts in considerable detail, 
making it clear that, in his view, there is no substitute for aggressive and 
audacious tactics that emphasize maneuver and attack. And he heaps scorn on 
some of Israel's best-known political and military leaders when he concludes 
that they acted less boldly than they could have. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the account sometimes varies from what has become the generally 
accepted historical record. As a general and as defense minister, Sharon's 
decisions were often controversial. This is his version of reality and it is 
not always shared by others who participated in the battles. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Sharon maintains that he did nothing wrong in ordering troops of 
the Lebanese Falangist militia to mop up Palestine Liberation Organization 
guerrillas who, Israeli intelligence reports indicated, were hidden in the 
Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps following the PLO's evacuation of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Lebanese Christian forces were told to make sure they did not harm 
civilians and that he expected them to comply with those orders. Sharon said he 
was at home on his ranch in Israel when he first heard reports that the 
Falangists were engaged in indiscriminate killing of women, children, old men 
and other noncombatants. 
</P>
<P>
"(N)o one had batted an eye at the idea of sending in the Falangists; certainly 
no one had in any way anticipated the events that occurred that night," he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
However, a three-member commission, headed by Chief Justice Yitzhak Kahan of 
the Israeli Supreme Court, decided that Sharon was indirectly responsible for 
the killings because he knew, or should have known, that the Falangists would 
take revenge on Palestinian civilians for the assassination earlier in the 
month of the Falangist leader Bashir Gemayel. Despite Sharon's protest that no 
one could have foreseen the massacre, many witnesses told the commission that 
it was common knowledge that the Falangists were bent on revenge and, given 
their place in the history of Lebanon's bloody communal strife, there was a 
high risk of atrocity. 
</P>
<P>
There is much in Sharon's book that will outrage his many enemies. His 
narrative is a continuous recitation of past battles, both military and 
political -- most of them won, a few of them lost. But the reader will be 
hard-pressed to find a single instance where Sharon admits to even the 
possibility that he may have been wrong. By Sharon's account, Israel prevailed 
when it listened to him and foundered when it did not. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sharon's story parallels Israel's story. He recounts the names 
and events that formed the modern Jewish state. He is scathing in his treatment 
of longtime political foes like Peres and Bar Lev, apparently concluding -- no 
doubt correctly -- that anyone who would be offended by that criticism has been 
lost to his cause anyway. But he is often flattering in his description of 
Israeli heroes like David Ben Gurion, Menachem Begin and Moshe Dayan, possibly 
hoping to place himself in the same class with the nation's popular founding 
fathers. As for his potential rivals for leadership in the Likud -- Shamir and 
Deputy Prime Minister David Levy -- Sharon hardly mentions them at all.

THE JESTER AND THE KINGS A POLITICAL AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY MAREK HALTER; TRANSLATED 
BY LOWELL BIR (ARCADE PUBLISHING: $19.95; 288 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Friedland and Richard Hecht, Friedland and Hecht are now completing a 
book, To Rule Jerusalem, on the contemporary politics and religions of Israel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talk is powerful. Through conversations, people make history. "The Jester and 
the Kings" is an engaging autobiographical account of Marek Halter's efforts to 
get Arabs and Israelis to talk to one another. 
</P>
<P>
Halter, a Parisian artist, comes from a Jewish family who lived by the word -- 
printers who trace their trade back to Gutenberg. He grew up with the idea that 
to be Jewish was to be just. His family escaped the Warsaw ghetto through the 
sewers due to the daring of a Catholic friend and fellow member of his father's 
printer's union. After the war, Halter, a young militant for socialist Zionism 
and a budding artist, made his way to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
And in Paris he stayed. Halter felt that the existence of Israel had now made 
it possible for him to be a good Frenchman. "Now I was like others," he writes. 
But it wasn't so easy. Zionism's success did not end anti-Semitism. It only 
changed its forms. 
</P>
<P>
Halter became part of the great reservoir of emigre Jewish intellectuals whom 
France would honor as great Frenchmen, but never as Jews. Unlike many, he is a 
proud and public Jew. In those early years after World War II, a Jew could 
support the fledgling state of Israel and belong to what the socialists 
understood as the great progressive march of history. The Soviet Union had been 
one of the first to support Israel. As he marched in Paris' May Day parade of 
1949, Halter recounts that the crowd cheered for the Algerians and the 
Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
The Six-Day War changed all that. The Israelis now occupied all the territory 
that was originally to be partitioned into a Jewish and an Arab state. Israel 
had proved herself a regional power. As Halter's account makes clear, it was a 
power the world simply could not accept. The world could respect Jews who lived 
by the word, but they were deeply uncomfortable when they showed themselves 
capable of wielding weapons of steel. In short, when the Jewish state began to 
act like all the others, the world turned its back in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
The denigration of Israel was most abrupt among the European left. Once a 
progressive light to the nations, Israel became a pariah pioneer state. Halter 
shows how much of the socialist community projected its image of struggle 
against the dark forces of Western imperialism onto the Arab jihad against 
little Israel. 
</P>
<P>
And the country that made the most radical about-face was Halter's own. France, 
which had been Israel's major military supplier, now turned her back on her. 
While some French Jews were now proud to be Jewish, others squirmed in their 
very skins. Jewish students, Halter recounts, were afraid to admit that they 
had relatives in Israel. In the student revolution of 1968, Claude Lanzmann, 
the producer of "Shoah" who had fought the Nazis as a teen-ager, was called a 
"supporter of the fascist Zionists" by a French militant for being offended by 
Fatah's violent posturing against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Halter and his wife Clara's frantic efforts to achieve peace were premised on a 
simple proposition: that two nations in two states must share one land in 
peace. He became the tireless go-between, the court jester who believed that 
his naive dream of peace had power to persuade enemy kings that the time to 
talk was now. With the traces of a lost civilization still on his tongue, he 
was able to woo an initially mistrustful Prime Minister Golda Meir by breaking 
into Yiddish. There is high drama, indeed sexuality, in Halter's promise of 
conversation between enemies. Unfortunately, the promise is rarely consummated. 
</P>
<P>
Halter's crusade took place between Israel's victory in the 1967 war and the 
"earthquake" that brought Menachem Begin to power in 1977. His repeated 
failures provide a cautionary tale for those who are now trying to succeed 
where he did not. Halter failed because what the Arabs would say in private 
they could not repeat in public. PLO members repeatedly denied having made 
statements that the Halters had on tape. The whispers of peace began early. In 
1969, Yasser Arafat and his top aides were willing to accept a two-state 
solution in private, but not in public. 
</P>
<P>
Halter failed because the Palestinians felt vulnerable when compared to the 
Israelis, lived daily the humiliation of dispossession and occupation, and 
demanded that Israel recognize their national right first before they 
recognized Israel's. The Palestinians understood their refusal to speak to 
Israel as their last and most potent weapon. He failed because Palestinian 
radicals interrupted the conversation with terror against Israeli civilians and 
Palestinian moderates. Thus Palestinian radicals massacred Israeli athletes in 
Munich to help prevent an imminent conversation between Egyptians and Israelis 
for which Halter had been the go-between. Because the conversation did not 
occur, the Egyptians launched the Yom Kippur War. Arafat was always afraid that 
Dr. George Habash and his Soviet-supported Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine would murder him for any moderation. 
</P>
<P>
Halter's account makes sad reading, for it reveals just how much the situation 
has changed and how the premises that might have brought peace even a decade 
ago no longer seem to have the capacity to persuade. In Halter's world, it was 
the Arabs who were most reluctant. Israel's elite -- David Ben-Gurion, Golda 
Meir and Moshe Dayan -- were willing to talk to Egypt and even the PLO well 
before Egypt or the PLO were willing to talk to them. Even as Menahem Begin's 
minister of defense after 1977, Dayan still wanted to meet with Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
Halter could speak independently to Arab and Palestinian leaders, and then make 
his way comfortably through the corridors of the Knesset. He fervently believed 
that once Arafat spoke the magic words accepting Israel and renouncing 
terrorism that there would be a groundswell of Israeli support for territorial 
concessions and negotiations with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Sadat made his triumphal visit to Jerusalem, Halter met with 
Arafat and asked him to repeat Sadat's brave move. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the Israelis to recognize us first!" Arafat reportedly shot back. 
And what if Begin refused? 
</P>
<P>
"Then hundreds of thousands of Israelis would demonstrate in the streets," 
Halter replied. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Halter's dreams have come true. Except hundreds of thousands of Israelis 
are not marching in the streets. Palestinians who support the PLO talk 
regularly to Israelis, but the Israeli Knesset has now made it illegal for them 
to talk to members of the PLO. In 1988, American Jews, including Los Angeles' 
Stanley Sheinbaum, talked on the record to Yasser Arafat about his willingness 
to accept Israel. Israeli and American Jewish leaders treated them as quislings 
who had ventured beyond responsible political behavior. Israelis who are 
willing to talk to the PLO have been either pushed out of their parties or 
shoved to the margins of the power structure. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO has officially recognized Israel. It took the intifada and sustained 
Soviet pressure on the PLO radicals to do it. The Palestinians have played 
their card. The move allowed the American government to begin official contact 
with the PLO, discussions that Congress now seems determined to cripple. It now 
appears that Israel will not begin the conversation until it is forced to. And 
there is nobody in the wings that appears willing to even nudge Israel to the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Halter's book explains why the words Palestinians have now spoken in public are 
so important.

FICTION IN BRIEF: MAN WITHOUT MEMORY BY RICHARD BURGIN (UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS

Opening this book is like stepping into quicksand. Richard Burgin's ingenious 
tales are disconcerting from the word go. The opening story, "Notes on Mrs. 
Slaughter," begins: "I'm living with Mrs. Slaughter in her apartment in 
Cambridge. She's not a bad housekeeper and now that the Mafia is beginning to 
leave her alone, she's regained her skill in cooking." The reader never knows 
where to find solid ground: Are these characters joking? Are they sane? "It's 
only a story," one comforts oneself. And yet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
These may be the people one stands next to in the grocery line. One jostles 
them in the street. After reading these stories, who knows how they will react? 
Mrs. Slaughter's lodger, reading a newspaper in Harvard Square, is seized by 
vertigo: "Suddenly I was overwhelmed by the amount of work that went into 
producing it, the work that was in it. Afraid of bursting into tears, I quickly 
put it back on the stand." His solution: "Maybe there were too many newspapers 
in Harvard Square. That may be why I started to take the bus out to the suburbs 
. . . to do my walking there."

A television writer and producer whose credits include "Dynasty," "Dallas," 
"Falcon Crest" and the miniseries "Scruples," Camille Marchetta begins with a 
story fit for her accustomed medium. Photographer Nikki Collier receives an 
advance copy of an unauthorized biography about her great friends, the Waltons. 
Theirs is a tale to excite the attention of the tabloids: An American 
playwright and an English film star leave respective mates to run off together. 
Nikki, who has known David Walton since childhood, rebels against the 
unfairness of such breezy journalistic treatment of a tragic story. "Lovers 
&amp; Friends" is her recollection of the Waltons' affair and marriage, the 
story of a perfect love containing the seeds of its own destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Marchetta's prose is well-paced and sensitive, moving from London to New York 
to Vienna in a sweep of elegance and bittersweet romance. The complexity of her 
characters sets her apart from the popular writers with whom one is tempted to 
compare her; their intelligence appears in actions and thoughts rather than in 
assertion by the author. The descriptions of theater life are particularly 
vivid.

GROOM FALCONER -- CIRCA 1903 BY NORMAN DUBIE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Out walking along the river 
</P>
<P>
I still saw the fever with her children 
</P>
<P>
At supper in the coal light. Snow falling, 
</P>
<P>
I climbed up through the wood 
</P>
<P>
To the asylum to visit with Sister 
</P>
<P>
In the locked ward. But hesitated 
</P>
<P>
And went to the cottage to see the insomniac 
</P>
<P>
Rich child who sits naked at the window: 
</P>
<P>
Last night, in kerosene light, her back 
</P>
<P>
Had a quality of milkglass. She curls 
</P>
<P>
In the chair. 
</P>
<P>
Her knees under chin, the room black -- 
</P>
<P>
The light at the window is all 
</P>
<P>
Moon and snow. She is at it again: 
</P>
<P>
With the nail of the little finger 
</P>
<P>
She has flayed 
</P>
<P>
The thumb of the same hand; 
</P>
<P>
All but the little finger arthritic 
</P>
<P>
With the procedure: the raw thumb 
</P>
<P>
White like a boiled egg 
</P>
<P>
In an upturned palm; the dead skin,

<P>
Bits of shell, not polished by hen straw. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the window there is a sudden

<P>
Convulsion of wind in the blue spruce,

Boughs dumping snow. I imagine

The brass makeweights that lift the other pan,

Of this past summer, dust and pollen

Rising around oxslaughter. A shudder

Passes through the child, taking

She cuts herself for the first time, a trickle

Of blood at the knuckle of the thumb

Like the single red thread

Through the lace hood and jesses

Loosens: one wing, one stone.

FICTION IN BRIEF: BLACK BODY BY H.C. TURK (VILLARD BOOKS: $19.95; 517 PP.)

"Black Body" is the intricate and lubricious tale of Alba, a young witch caught 
in the schemes of an 18th-Century English noblewoman. If there is a theme to 
"Black Body," it is the familiar moral revelation that human society is 
intolerant of deviation and implacable in its drive to exterminate the 
foreigner. In more capable hands, this might have been an interesting tale. The 
author's crude, unmercifully drawn out scenes of sodomy, bestial and otherwise, 
are unfortunately more memorable than his clever invention of the race of 
witches. 
</P>
<P>
The story is told through Alba's eyes as she awaits execution. Alba is a freak 
among witches, a white witch who can pass for human but is deadly to any man 
who falls prey to her irresistible attractions. Lady Amanda Rathel seeks 
revenge against a man who has jilted her, and when fortune reveals to her the 
secret of the white witch, she takes the orphaned girl as ward (Alba's mother 
has recently been burned at the stake). Lady Rathel arranges to marry Alba off 
to her enemy's son, thereby ensuring his demise. 
</P>
<P>
Witch though she is, Alba is portrayed as an innocent child of nature. Born in 
the wilds, she is suddenly introduced to London society, where she attempts to 
decipher the social codes and artifices of the English aristocracy. Lady Rathel 
schools her in the appearances and guiles of womanhood, the better to catch her 
prey. One of the devices used to etch Alba's alien character is a superhuman 
sense of smell (seemingly lifted from Patrick Suskind's "Perfume") that allows 
witches to nose out the hidden emotions of "sinners," their term for ordinary 
mortals. When Alba and her intended meet at the opera, she is beside herself 
with discomfort, having been got up in "strung oyster droppings," the most 
innocuous of the innumerable anal allusions that underlie the novel like a 
basso continuo line.

Although comic strips in the United States have traditionally been limited to 
mindless comedy, Howard Cruse treats the AIDS crisis more intelligently in 
"Wendel on the Rebound," a collection of his strips about "the gays next door." 
Wendel copes with fear, anger, grief and guilt when he learns that his first 
lover, Sawyer, has the disease. Cruse depicts the effects of AIDS with an 
honesty missing from Hoffman's limp tale: Sawyer's fundamentalist parents 
banish him from their home. Cruse balances this depressing realism with an 
unassuming humor reminiscent of the old "Archie" comics. (Wendel's redoubtable 
mother, a former civil rights activist, takes Sawyer in and tells off his 
parents.) Although the occasional sexual references might earn the book a "PG" 
rating, "Wendel" has an innocent appeal that transcends the boundaries of 
sexual preference.

One of the great 19th-Century European traveler-photographers, John Thomson 
visited China and Southeast Asia during the 1860s and 1870s, when relatively 
little was known about their cultures in the West. His charm and skill with 
languages enabled him to photograph subjects inaccessible to most Westerners, 
including a portrait of King Mongkut of Siam (the king of "The King and I") and 
the interior of a mandarin's home. His respectful treatment of his subjects is 
refreshingly free of the patronizing racism that typified English attitudes 
toward Asians. The modern reader is less likely to be impressed by the 
historical significance of Thomson's sepia-toned photographs than by their 
exquisite beauty.

Alice Hoffman's best-selling novel about a young girl with AIDS is a mawkish 
tear-jerker that attempts to put a socially acceptable face on the pandemic. As 
soon as her mother reflects in Chapter 1 that Amanda sometimes seems to be 
"made up not of flesh but of points of brilliant light," the reader knows the 
kid isn't long for this world. When she develops AIDS from a blood transfusion, 
her family must confront Fear, Ignorance and Tragedy. The reader must confront 
a lack of character development and basic writing skills. Subplots involving 
intergenerational conflicts and an incipient romance between Amanda's mother 
and pediatrician are left dangling, like the raveled strands of an old macrame 
hanging. 
</P>
<P>
In America, AIDS has primarily struck intravenous drug users and gay and 
bisexual men. By ignoring the people whose suffering has been accorded marginal 
significance at best and giving readers the more palatable sorrows of a 
wholesome WASP family, Hoffman panders to the prejudices she pretends to 
challenge.

D'ALBERT: "Tiefland." Isabell Strauss, Rudolf Schock, Gerd Feldhoff; RIAS 
Choir; Berlin Symphony, conducted by Hans Zanotelli. Eurodisc 7797-2-RG (two 
compact discs). Eugene d'Albert's one enduring contribution to the operatic 
literature is a bit of Teutonic verismo set in Spain, heavily indebted to 
Wagnerian and Straussian chromaticism and a bit too much of all of them. Rudolf 
Lothar's libretto, which concerns the evil landowner Sebastiano's attempt to 
marry off his mistress, Marta, to the simple shepherd Pedro, while still 
enjoying her favors, strains the credulity, even in the wildly irrational world 
of opera. That may explain why the piece, despite its moderate appeal, has 
failed to convert audiences outside German-language countries. Eurodisc's 
performance derives from the sound track of a 1963 television film. Strauss' 
passionate Marta make one regret the soprano's premature death; Schock as the 
hero and Feldhoff as the villain voice their platitudes convincingly. 
Zanotelli's conducting and RCA's digital remastering are serviceable.ALLAN

ROSA PONSELLE. Songs and Arias. BMG Music 7810-2-RG (compact disc). These 
recordings, spanning 31 years, show what arguably was the greatest dramatic 
soprano of her time in repertory that ranges from the most difficult bel-canto 
challenges to simple concert chestnuts. 
</P>
<P>
She was not dubbed a "Caruso in petticoats" for nothing. Her voice was large, 
hauntingly dark, and it was the same sound throughout its range from luxuriant 
pianissimos to rock-solid fortes without jarring register breaks. Ponselle's 
impeccable coloratura technique makes her versions of "Ernani, involami" and 
"Casta diva" the preferred ones. A special treat is "O patria mia," an aria 
which terrified her because of its top C and caused her to venture very few 
performances of "Aida." The note holds no terrors for her here. 
</P>
<P>
Her attention to commitment and detail carries over to the songs, of which 
Sodero's "Amuri, amuri" -- accompanied by Ponselle herself at the piano -- is 
the most moving. Recorded in 1954, she draws a wrenching miniature drama in 
Sicilian dialect that is worth the price of the disc.WALTER PRICE

JUNIOR HIGH-JINKS: Hits, the irreverent music biz weekly, chose an appropriate 
cover subject for its third anniversary issue: Mad magazine mascot Alfred E. 
Neuman. In an acknowledgment, the editors of Hits thank Mad publisher William 
Gaines not only for allowing the smart-alecky Neuman to grace their cover, "but 
for raising us on attitude." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's sassy approach has made it a colorful supplement to the drier, 
more serious Billboard. And the approach seems to be working. The anniversary 
issue is studded with congratulatory ads from record companies, most of them 
mimicking the sarcastic Hits tone. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysalis Records' ad reads: "You people are a bunch of disgusting, music 
reporting pigs with absolutely no respect for journalistic integrity, even less 
moral decency, plus you have you a collective sense of humor only a primate 
from a bad gene pool would admire." The punch line?: "No wonder we can relate 
so well." 
</P>
<P>
Capitol Records' ad was even more barbed. It depicted a dog, leg lifted, 
relieving itself on a copy of Hits. The notation: "Promotion with a Capitol 
'P.' "

POP EYE: REPORT CARD ON MTV COLLEGE REP PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine getting college credit for conducting a contestant search for MTV's 
game show "Remote Control," featuring comedian Colin Quinn. Or for setting up 
"MTV Wild Card" parties to tie into the channel's "Club MTV" dance show. Or for 
working with a MTV production crew on "Spring Break" in Daytona, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Sound too good to be true? 
</P>
<P>
It isn't. Students at 10 colleges around the country, including USC locally, 
are receiving up to four college credits for being their on-campus MTV 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
At USC, the program is worth up to four credits depending on the number of 
hours the rep devotes to it. Students of any major are eligible to receive 
credit for the program, which counts as a general elective course. 
</P>
<P>
MTV launched its college rep program on 10 campuses last year. The program is 
now on 20 campuses (only half of them grant college credit), and is slated to 
expand to 30 to 40 campuses in February. 
</P>
<P>
While some will say that this is the ultimate "mick" course, Tammy Andrews, the 
USC rep, says it has real educational value. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's almost more valuable than taking a regular class because I'm 
getting a lot of first-hand experience," said Andrews, a senior majoring in 
business and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"They send me a skeleton of a promotion and I have to go ahead and produce the 
event, doing all the budgeting and advertising. It's a lot of work. I have to 
utilize everything I've learned to pull these off and make them successful." 
</P>
<P>
The students aren't paid, though MTV director of marketing Sharon Moran said 
there are occasional opportunities to earn some money from the channel. 
</P>
<P>
But MTV gets a lot more out of it than just free labor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding out the interests of this audience," said Moran. "We're able to 
tap into our student reps to find out what the latest trends on campus may be: 
What are students wearing these days? What are they reading? 
</P>
<P>
"This word-of-mouth approach complements the more formalized college research 
studies that we've been involved in since last September. If we wanted to get 
immediate feedback to an idea that we might have at the channel, we can have 
our reps conduct informal surveys among students on their campuses." 
</P>
<P>
This feedback can help MTV's bottom line as well. "Knowing what our students on 
campus are interested in at any given point allows us to create sponsorable 
programs which meet advertisers' needs as well as being attractive to the 
students," Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
But the colleges receive no money for participating in the rep program. 
</P>
<P>
"They look at our program as a valuable opportunity for the reps, and also view 
the activities that we bring to campus at no charge to the university as 
exciting, free entertainment for the student population as a whole," she said.

ABORTION AND BIOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Julian P. Donahue's Aug. 20 letter defending a pro-abortion cartoon by Jules 
Feiffer must be correct because he is a biologist and curator of insects, 
right? 
</P>
<P>
It would be interesting to see Mr. Donahue's face the day it is decided that, 
like his "genetically unfit individuals," curators of insects "aren't making a 
meaningful contribution to society" and are "just taking up space." Should they 
then be eliminated, as individuals are eliminated in abortion and euthanasia? 
</P>
<P>
Donahue says it's a matter of "just good biology." I think not. Just bad 
philosophy.

As to KFI's general manager Howard Neal's statement, "We see ourselves as the 
Arsenio Hall of talk radio and KABC is Johnny Carson":

Everyone knows that the truest comparison would be KABC as the "MacNeil/Lehrer

Both the American and Vietnamese veterans communities found "Casualties of War" 
offensive. The portrayal of Vietnam War participants as kidnapers, rapists, 
murderers and cowards appears to be evidence that Hollyweird has tired of 
pro-eteran films such as "Rambo" and "Uncommon Valor."

<P>
Instead of presenting all the facts, director Brian DePalma smeared those who 
served while others hid behind college deferments or fled to Canada.

As a waitress at the Stage Deli in Century City, I must correct the Aug. 20 
letter of Beryl E. Arbit of Encino. Arbit complained that the rye bread we 
serve has no seeds and said, "The purveyors of this stuff should be consigned 
for life to counting the caraway seeds in every Carnegie (Deli) creation." 
Enclosed you will find a piece of the rye, filled with seeds. Obviously Ms. 
Arbit has been living in the Valley too long, got lost coming over the hill and 
ate someplace else.

SAVING KFAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matthew B. Topper's Aug. 20 letter is right in saying the conversion of KFAC to 
a rock station would be cultural vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
What can be done? As an ex-New Yorker, I see two options: (1) The City of Los 
Angeles could condemn KFAC under the eminent domain laws and operate the 
station itself; this sounds far-fetched, but the City of New York has been 
successfully operating WNYC for decades. (2) The Los Angeles Times could buy 
and operate a classical station itself. This is precisely the relation that the 
New York Times has with WQXR, which is primarily a classical station but also 
serves as a worthwhile extension of journalistic function.

DIFFERENT STANDARDS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Braxton's Aug. 20 article on Shelly Garrett's play "Beauty Shop" quotes 
Times critic Sylvie Drake as writing: "By the usual . . . standards 'Beauty 
Shop' is a sentimental, poorly structured, badly directed, self-congratulating 
show. But where is it written that those standards fit?" 
</P>
<P>
These comment and the tone of Braxton's article perpetuate a tiresome 
misconception. Some of us are tired of the lowest common denominator of black 
taste being equated with black taste, period. 
</P>
<P>
The music industry similarly insists on using the term black music only to 
describe what is played on AM radio -- as if Duke Ellington or Charles Mingus 
had never existed. 
</P>
<P>
"Beauty Shop" certainly has the right to exist, but spare us the inane 
suggestion that the type of theater it represents is somehow more ethnically 
authentic than serious plays such as those of Charles Fuller, August Wilson or 
Ron Milner.

INDIANA LEGEND SAYS WELSH SETTLERS ARRIVED IN THE 12TH CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI PERRAS, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHARLESTOWN, Ind. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a rugged bluff overlooking the Ohio River, known locally as "Devil's 
Backbone," centuries of overgrowth obscures a secret of history. 
</P>
<P>
Legend has it that this was the site of a large stone fort and a settlement of 
Welshmen who sailed to America three centuries before the time of Christopher 
Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
In 1799, early settlers found six skeletons clad in breastplates bearing a 
Welsh coat of arms. Indian legends told of "yellow-haired giants" who settled 
in Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Ohio and Tennessee -- a region they 
called "the Dark and Forbidden Land." 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists debunk the legend. They say that evidence indicates that the 
natives of the region once conducted a vigorous trading network nearby and 
buried their dead on the bluff. 
</P>
<P>
The bluff and its shadowy history have been virtually undisturbed since 1940, 
when the U.S. Army purchased it as part of a 10,000-acre site for a munitions 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the military is expected to sell off about 900 acres as part of a 
cost-cutting plan, and the state will have the first option to buy the land. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Charlestown Chamber of Commerce and the state Department of Natural 
Resources have called for a state park on the land, which includes the 
peninsula three miles east of Charlestown. 
</P>
<P>
"The older folks told children not to scale its walls, that the devil had put a 
curse on the place," Margaret Sweeney wrote in her 1967 book, "Fact, Fiction 
and Folklore of Southern Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the warning, many youngsters invaded the stronghold and came away 
with broken bones, bruises, cuts or even completely bewitched for investigating 
'Old Scratch's quarters.' " 
</P>
<P>
Upstream about 14 miles from Louisville, Ky., the craggy hill rises abruptly 
from the Indiana bank. Fourteen Mile Creek runs behind the hill, carving out a 
narrow strip of land between the creek and the river. 
</P>
<P>
The peninsula is less than 20 feet wide at the top and falls off abruptly on 
either side to the Ohio River and the creek. The resulting pear-shaped bluff 
has a flat top five to seven acres across and is almost inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cliffs Walled Off 
</P>
<P>
The earliest survey of the area, done in 1873 by state geologist E. T. Cox and 
his assistant, William Borden, found a prehistoric fortification on the 
hilltop. A man-made limestone wall, 150 feet long and 75 feet high in some 
places, stood along the front and one side of the hill where the cliffs could 
be scaled, Cox said in his report. 
</P>
<P>
The wall no longer exists, the area's early settlers having taken the huge, 
unmortared stones to build foundations, bridges and fences that can still be 
seen throughout the rolling countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Local legend says the walls were built by followers of Prince Madoc of Wales, 
who led an expedition in the late 12th Century and was never seen again. 
Tradition says they landed in America and settled briefly in Tennessee, then 
moved to Kentucky and southern Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, you couldn't find a better legend than this," said Dana Olson 
of Jeffersonville, an amateur historian and author of "Prince Madoc: Founder of 
Clark County, Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
"You've got princes and kings, and gold and silver, and wars. It would make a 
great movie." 
</P>
<P>
Olson's book says that Madoc was a son of King Owain Gwynedd and was one of his 
best naval commanders. Madoc's skills and curiosity took him to France and 
Spain and to Venice and other Mediterranean ports -- and on at least two trips 
to the Americas between 1165 and 1169. 
</P>
<P>
When Gwynedd died in 1169, his sons got into a feud over the throne. A 
disgusted Madoc, looking for more tranquil surroundings, sailed from Lundy 
Island south of Wales with three of his brothers and 10 ships. 
</P>
<P>
They are named among the missing in Britain's ancient maritime logs. 
</P>
<P>
Legend says they landed in Mobile Bay in 1170 and traveled up the Alabama River 
to where it meets the Coosa River, near present-day Alabama's borders with 
Georgia and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cherokee tradition, they settled there and intermarried with the 
Indians, and built five stone forts near what is now Chattanooga. Treasure 
hunters have found Roman coins, European oil lamps and goblets among the ruins, 
Olson says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fort Laid to Indians 
</P>
<P>
Excavations conducted by the anthropology department at the University of 
Tennessee concluded that one of the structures, known as Old Stone Fort, was 
built in the 3rd Century by an Indian culture that would have predated Madoc. 
</P>
<P>
No Welsh artifacts were found to substantiate the persistent Madoc legend. 
</P>
<P>
"In professional archeological circles, it's kind of pooh-poohed," Steve Cox, 
curator of the Tennessee State Museum, said. "There's no archeological 
evidence. That's really all that we have to go on in the prehistoric period." 
</P>
<P>
The legend says the Welsh-Indians were forced out of Tennessee by the Cherokee 
and migrated north into Kentucky and the Ohio River Valley by three separate 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
American Indians apparently first spread the tale of a race of White Indians 
who lived in the falls area on the Ohio, where Madoc's followers may have 
established their largest settlement. 
</P>
<P>
George Rogers Clark, the founder of Clarksville, Ind., first heard the story 
from Tobacco, a chief of the Piankeshaw. The chief told of a great battle 
between the Red and White Indians on Sand Island in the Ohio River, in which 
all the White Indians were slain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs of a Battle 
</P>
<P>
Maj. John Harrison, among others, has told of an extensive graveyard in that 
area, where thousands dead were buried in such confusion as to suggest a 
battle. The graveyard, if it existed, has been washed away. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Clark County's earliest settlers reportedly found ancient coins and 
European armor, some bearing the Welsh coat of arms. All of that armor has 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Clark found some armor-clad skeletons that he thought were ancient Welshmen and 
jotted down his findings in his personal memoirs, Olson says. A copy of this 
book, in Clark's own hand, was stolen years ago from the Jeffersonville public 
library. 
</P>
<P>
According to "Baird's History of Clark County," a tombstone dated 1186 was 
found in Jeffersonville in the 1800s, and early pioneers reportedly found 
natives throughout the interior who could converse in the Welsh language. 
</P>
<P>
A skull taken from Sand Island in the 1800s was identified by a Dr. Beckwith as 
"not that of an Indian." Beckwith's qualifications are not known. 
</P>
<P>
None of the physical evidence has been scientifically examined or confirmed. In 
fact, virtually all of it has disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could reproduce everything that's been found or that it had been put 
in a museum," Olson said. "There are no museums here." 
</P>
<P>
Without proof, archeologists and other experts have their doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"Where you find prehistoric or human occupation you normally find a range of 
evidence, such as refuse, garbage, settlements, villages, sites, artifacts," 
Gary Ellis, senior archeologist for the state of Indiana, 
</P>
<P>
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There just isn't any. Most of it is rumor." 
</P>
<P>
Students of the early tribal cultures say that the stone fort probably was 
built by American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't like to believe the Indians could have stacked rocks 
that size, but there's evidence around the country they did things like that," 
said Donna Calhoun of rural Scottsburg, who is writing a history of the Indians 
in southern Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Ray White, tribal chairman of the Miami nation, suggested that the coins, 
lamps, armor and other artifacts easily could have been brought inland via the 
Indian trading network. A diary Calhoun uncovered in her research mentions an 
Indian trading post 1 1/2 miles east of Charlestown. 
</P>
<P>
But Olson contends that the evidence supporting the legend is overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upset for Historians 
</P>
<P>
"What something like this does is alter the applecart of history," she said. 
"Any time you get all this and put it before all these people who've got 
degrees in anthropology, it really turns the table. They don't know how to 
combat it, so they say, 'No, this is a myth.' " 
</P>
<P>
An archeological overview in 1984 concluded that the research value of Devil's 
Backbone could be quite high. Under federal law, Indian mounds and artifacts 
must be protected from development, and they could provide a unique look at 
southern Indiana's early population. 
</P>
<P>
Or, they could lend credence to a legend and shatter accepted theories on the 
discovery and exploration of the New World. 
</P>
<P>
"We need somebody to go into Charlestown and just do a survey," White said. 
"They really need to find out what's there.

PESTICIDES KILL CRITTERS' URGE FOR REPRODUCTION

<TEXT>
<P>
Birth control may succeed where an arsenal of toxic agents have failed: in 
checking the baby boom among fleas, cockroaches, mosquitoes and other insect 
tormentors of man and beast. 
</P>
<P>
A new generation of pesticides recently put on the market endangers these pest 
populations without threatening public health or the environment, say experts 
on the project spawned by a developer of the birth control pill for women. 
</P>
<P>
Studies and field tests point to "insect growth regulators" as the first weapon 
potentially powerful enough to wipe out such poison-resistant die-hards as 
fleas and roaches, which have accompanied humans from cave to condominium. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators, or IGRs -- synthesized versions of natural hormones in the 
brain -- interrupt the insect's life cycle, making it incapable of reproducing. 
</P>
<P>
Developed at Zoecon Corp. -- zoe from the Greek for life and con for control -- 
in Palo Alto, IGRs do not stop adult bugs dead in their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, they go after pests during the immature stages. Eggs do not mature into 
larvae; larvae do not mature into adults. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, as insect young develop into adults, they undergo a series of molts -- 
from three to as many as 20 or more -- during which the outer layer of the body 
wall is shed and renewed. IGRs disrupt these cycles by imitating insect growth 
hormones. 
</P>
<P>
"While conventional pesticides poison pests, IGRs mimic their biochemistry to 
control their population -- presenting virtually no hazard to people, pets or 
environment because they are species-specific," said Bill Donahue, senior 
research biologist at Zoecon's corporate headquarters in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"IGRs are the future," said Dallas veterinarian Jim Humphries, host of a 
syndicated talk show. "They are a breakthrough that is safer and more effective 
than any insecticide ever developed." 
</P>
<P>
In the consumer mass market, Americans spend an estimated $600 million annually 
on products to control fleas, ants and cockroaches. Each year, they buy another 
$250 million in flea, tick and fly poisons from veterinarians and pet stores. 
In addition, professional pest control operators pour $80 million yearly into 
the pesticide market. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to cash in on the public's growing reluctance to use toxic agents, 
chemical companies have begun to actively pursue the development of IGRs, which 
first came to researchers' attention in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
IGR sprays, foggers and concentrates available to U.S. consumers through 
veterinarians, pet shops and exterminators can combat roaches, fleas, 
mosquitoes, horn and corn flies, pharaoh ants, beetles and some stored food 
insects such as weevils. 
</P>
<P>
Experts at Zoecon, founded in 1968 by birth control pioneer Carl Djerassi, and 
other firms are testing the technology for such possible new uses as curbing 
insects that each year devour 10% of crops and stored grains. 
</P>
<P>
"Our focus has turned toward agriculture," said Jim Howze, Zoecon's manager of 
marketing communications, noting that the horn fly alone causes about $70 
million in damage annually by sucking blood from cattle and accounting for up 
to 20 pounds in lost body weight per head. 
</P>
<P>
"The public's anti-chemical attitude and changing regulatory climate that bans 
pesticides has made the time right for using this technology in areas once 
considered unprofitable ventures, such as termite control," he said.

CALIFORNIA GROWERS FEARFUL OF MEXICO TRADE CONCESSIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A committee of California agribusiness interests is asking the Bush 
Administration to avoid making unilateral trade concessions to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The members fear the Administration would tend to protect major American crops, 
mainly grains, at the expense of California's specialty fruits and vegetables 
which Mexico also grows in abundance and increasingly exports to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The Californians, calling themselves the Cal-Ag Committee on International 
Trade, drafted a brief urging American trade representatives to avoid any 
unilateral trade agreements until completion of the latest round of trade talks 
among most of the world's nations, called the Uruguay Round. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faster Pace Seen 
</P>
<P>
The Cal-Ag committee worries that an attempt will be made to "accelerate" 
future trade concessions between Mexico and the United States while talk of 
broader concessions involving many nations still is under way in the Uruguay 
Round. 
</P>
<P>
"The acceleration concept is extremely vague, and it has not been 
satisfactorily defined in a specific sense," says the Cal-Ag Committee's brief. 
Chairman Bruce Obbink, head of the California Table Grape Commission, says 
growers of specialty crops organized the group a decade ago to hire experts who 
could give them "an early warning signal" about any trade talks that might hurt 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"For Mexico, the issue of accelerating any kind of trade concessions presents a 
number of concerns," the committee's brief states. "Mexican agriculture 
benefits from a broad array of agricultural subsidies." 
</P>
<P>
But, the brief adds, there is "an appalling lack of documentation" about 
Mexico's subsidies, so phasing in concessions now would let many of them escape 
the attempt to reduce or eliminate subsidies on imports. 
</P>
<P>
"Likewise, there is a dearth of information concerning Mexico's production 
capacity," the committee's brief continues. "Consequently, it is difficult to 
know the probable economic effect of any trade concessions on the U.S. 
agricultural sector." 
</P>
<P>
The committee expresses doubt that the United States would agree to end grain 
subsidies in a bilateral agreement with Mexico although that is the logical 
result of the Uruguay Round, in which the United States is calling for all 
nations to phase out agricultural subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The committee contended that "any type of free trade agreement (with Mexico) 
will benefit American producers of subsidized grains at the expense of 
California specialty crops that receive no subsidies. . . . Consequently, 
California fruits and vegetables will pay for the trade deal." 
</P>
<P>
The Cal-Ag committee feels "it would be terribly inequitable to lower tariffs 
on fruits and vegetables while not simultaneously eliminating agricultural 
subsidies on grains." 
</P>
<P>
The committee points out that Mexican exports of fresh produce to the United 
States already have increased from 27 commodities worth $379 million in 1980 to 
40 commodities worth $602 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no compelling reason to offer them even more advantageous access 
until the Uruguay Round is completed," the Cal-Ag committee concludes.

NEW DRUG OFFERS HOPE FOR SOME SCHIZOPHRENICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frederick J. Benham Sr. had his first bout with mental illness in 1948, when he 
was on the cusp of adulthood and away from home in the Army. Something just 
snapped, and he found himself in a military hospital, undergoing hypnosis. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time there was no such thing as tranquilizers," the 58-year-old 
Bridgeport, Conn., man said of the array of anti-psychotic medications that 
later would help usher in a new era of treatment for schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
Benham has been on and off neuroleptics, as they are called, since 1960. Like 
others who have taken them, he is ambivalent about the drugs, which becalm 
hallucinations and clarify disordered thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me relief for symptoms I had," he said. "I would get over-excited . 
. . and they made me more controllable." But, "as for making me feel good, it 
was not as if I was on Cloud 9." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years neuroscientists have searched for an improvement on the old 
anti-schizophrenic medicines. One could be on the market within months, its 
manufacturer says. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we welcomed" the older generation of drugs, "they've got 
limitations," said Dr. William M. Glazer, an associate professor of psychiatry 
at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
The problems of classical anti-schizophrenic medications such as Thorazine, 
Mellaril and Haldol include their awful side effects: uncontrollable -- and 
often irreversible -- tics and twitches, motor disturbances and persistent 
states of restlessness. 
</P>
<P>
Another limitation is that they are not effective on as many patients as 
doctors would like, said Glazer, one of many scientists around the United 
States experimenting with new drugs that offer "a better profile." 
</P>
<P>
One of those drugs, clozapine, is likely to be on the market for some 
schizophrenics by the end of the year, said Dr. Gilbert Honigfeld, who has led 
clozapine research for Sandoz Pharmaceuticals since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Clozapine is one of a new class of atypical neuroleptics that works differently 
in the brain and doesn't seem to cause the usual side effects. 
</P>
<P>
Also, studies show that clozapine more effectively reaches schizophrenics who 
for unknown reasons do not respond well to the older drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its anti-delusional activity, clozapine seems able to help break 
through the wall of isolation and withdrawal that often surrounds patients in a 
way that current medicines do not, said Dr. John W. Goethe, head of clinical 
research at the Institute of Living in Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
Although it avoids the worst side effects of the existing anti-psychotic drugs, 
clozapine does have some side effects. It causes 2% of the patients taking it 
to suffer a severe drop in white blood cells, Honigfeld said. Those cells are 
key to the immune system's ability to fight infection, and the condition can be 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, if the Food and Drug Administration approves it for other than 
experimental use, clozapine will be restricted to the quarter-million or so 
schizophrenics who do not respond to the current drugs, Honigfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most debilitating and chronic, if least understood, diseases, 
schizophrenia exacts an enormous toll on the estimated 1 million Americans who 
have it, as well as on their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
Some schizophrenics' "lack of insight," or failure to acknowledge their illness 
and the need for treatment, is a common obstacle to many patients' getting 
better and staying out of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But the effectiveness and side effects of the classical neuroleptics are issues 
that have plagued patients and doctors for years, Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 15% of schizophrenics on the regimen of existing drugs show a 
complete response to the medication, Glazer said, while three-quarters show a 
partial response. Ten percent show no response. 
</P>
<P>
The side effect known as tardive dyskinesia strikes a third of all patients 
taking neuroleptics, said Glazer, who heads a Yale clinic that investigates the 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Some patients are hit severely, exhibiting movement disturbances that an 
onlooker might mistakenly conclude result from the mental disorder itself. 
These include bizarre motions of the mouth and tongue, lip-smacking, chewing 
and tics of the fingers and toes, Glazer said. Painful side effects include 
rigid, immobilized features. The eyes can become fixed, the jaw thrust open. 
</P>
<P>
Other patients experience a chronic restlessness and hyperexcitability that can 
be "very, very debilitating," he added. These side effects can have the 
paradoxical effect of stimulating the very delusions and hallucinations the 
drugs are meant to correct. 
</P>
<P>
Today's research aims at finding chemicals that minimize side effects, while 
more exquisitely fine-tuning the chemical reactions in the brain that have been 
linked to the onset of schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
After two decades of study, neuroscience still has only dimly illuminated those 
reactions, even in the normal brain. 
</P>
<P>
It took seven years after the discovery of Thorazine in 1952 for a Swedish 
scientist to determine that the drug worked by interfering with the passage 
within the brain of a chemical called dopamine. 
</P>
<P>
Dopamine is one of the neurotransmitters responsible for the way information 
from our senses, our memories and our conscious and unconscious thoughts is 
relayed back and forth. In the normal brain, these neurotransmitters work 
dynamically with each other, allowing us to perceive the world and act in it in 
ways that are varied and idiosyncratic, to be sure, but also, by consensus, 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
In the schizophrenic brain, that delicate balance is upset by miniature deluges 
and droughts of dopamine, and, it is increasingly believed, other 
neurochemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are "hot on the trail of the mechanism underlying schizophrenia," 
Glazer said. Although "dopamine continues to be the leading candidate," its 
relationship to other neurotransmitters is a subject of intense inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Clozapine research is focusing on the way the drug regulates the balance 
between dopamine and another neurotransmitter, serotonin, Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
Research suggests that something about the drug's effect on dopamine and 
serotonin enables it to work in schizophrenics who have been unresponsive to 
the older drugs, he said. Brain biochemistry is showing that schizophrenia is 
less "a unitary disease than a spectrum of diseases," Goethe of the Institute 
of Living said. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment of schizophrenia has come a long way since the day Fred Benham 
entered Walter Reed Hospital at age 17. 
</P>
<P>
Before Thorazine, patients were strapped in "tranquilizer chairs," spun around 
until they were dizzy, restrained much of the time and given high doses of 
insulin designed to plunge them into insulin shock, a procedure then thought to 
be therapeutic, Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question, he added, that the introduction of anti-psychotic drugs 
revolutionized the care of schizophrenia and paved the way for the movement 
that helps the mentally ill leave the hospital to start a new life back in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 years later, clozapine is "only tiding things over" until the next 
"designer drug" comes along, made safer and more effective by "bending atoms, 
adding a little carbon here, a hydrogen there," Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, he finds the prospects of a new generation of atypical 
neuroleptics exciting, capable of producing major changes in the delivery of 
mental health care.

HUNGARIAN OPPOSITION WRITERS BLOSSOM AS PRESS AND BOOK CENSORSHIP LAWS FADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Budapest's busy Liberation Square, passers-by browse at a stand stacked with 
books and pamphlets chronicling the Soviet suppression of the 1956 anti-Kremlin 
uprising in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
At a nearby state-run bookstore, "The Gulag Archipelago," the chilling account 
of Stalinist repression by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the exiled Soviet Nobel 
Prize-winning novelist, is on prominent display, along with the works of 
Hungary's most gifted opposition writers. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, we would have been hauled to the police station, interrogated, 
beaten and fined for this," said Zoltan Kurdi, a dissident-turned-publisher who 
operates a small book stand on Liberation Square. 
</P>
<P>
His selection contains memoirs of those who fought in the streets in the 1956 
uprising, works critical of Hungary's ruling Communist Party, and Western 
accounts of life and politics in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by a new law that virtually eliminates all forms of press and book 
censorship, Hungary's underground publishers have abandoned their basements and 
attics for the streets and storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
They are being joined by an increasing number of private entrepreneurs trying 
to cash in on a new and unfettered market, with official publishing houses also 
eager to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Even state-run firms freely tout interpretations of the 1956 revolt against 
Stalinism that contradict the long-held official view that it was a 
counterrevolution. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of smuggling them in from the West, Hungarians need only walk to their 
neighborhood bookstore for copies of George Orwell's "1984" or "Animal Farm" 
and the works of distinguished Hungarians that were published only abroad for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
"After 40 years of a controlled book culture, we are rapidly entering an era of 
open and free book publishing," said Peter Inkei, general director of the 
Ministry of Education and Culture's publishing division. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago all this seemed like something that could only happen in the 
very distant future," added Inkei, whose office once was responsible for 
red-flagging potentially troublesome manuscripts for Central Committee censors. 
</P>
<P>
The changes, like the bold overall reforms that made them possible, have 
brought new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, the people who published underground literature were risking their 
freedom to fight cultural repression," said Kurdi, 24, whose group this year 
formed a limited publishing partnership. 
</P>
<P>
"Now our biggest problem is to find ways of dealing with unscrupulous 
publishers and making sound business decisions to stay afloat." 
</P>
<P>
The publication of Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag Archipelago" has caused the most 
headaches for government officials and fledgling private publishers. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian translation is a pirate edition, published privately without the 
author's permission and in violation of international copyright laws. 
</P>
<P>
"These people (the pirate publishers) are only motivated by greed," fumed 
Kurdi, who said he and his friends had risked prison for years to bring out 
similar books at or below cost when there was no other legal outlet. 
</P>
<P>
Inkei said publication of "Gulag Archipelago" put the government in a quandary. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had tried to ban it at first, we would have been accused of trying to 
suppress it," said Inkei, whose office is moving to prohibit sale of the book 
because it violates Hungarian marketing laws. 
</P>
<P>
Inkei said his staff gets criticized by the 30 state-run publishing houses for 
allegedly favoring the 100 or so new private publishers, who in turn have not 
forgotten that his office was once responsible for "sniffing out trouble" in 
submitted manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
Inkei said his staff devotes its time to advising the government on publishing 
and tax laws and evaluating grant applications from government-owned and 
private publishers. 
</P>
<P>
All could use the money. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're operating in the red," Kurdi said, surveying the array of 
once-outlawed books at his book stall.

KEY LIES IN BLIND PIANO TUNER'S FINGERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gerald Smith has never seen a piano, although he has made his living seated at 
one for 41 years, running his fingers over the strings as well as the keys. 
</P>
<P>
Blind since birth, Smith began tuning pianos in 1948. He learned his trade at 
the Tennessee School for the Blind in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out I was going to have to make a living some way or another," Smith 
said. "They taught you how to make brooms and they taught you chair caning. I 
didn't think I could do either one of them too good." 
</P>
<P>
While playing the alto horn in the school band, Smith found piano tuning more 
to his liking. 
</P>
<P>
"In the band, you have to tune up, and I found out I could do that pretty 
good," said the native of Jamestown, Ala. "I had a pretty good ear." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's good ear and sensitive fingers have tuned keyboards for the likes of 
Floyd Cramer, Ronnie Milsap, Johnny Cash and the Nashville Symphony, as well as 
thousands of customers for the two dealers he has worked for. 
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old tuner is now semi-retired, spending three days a week 
sharpening the sounds from uprights and grands. It takes him about an hour to 
tune a piano. 
</P>
<P>
He makes his way easily among the instruments in a showroom, identifying the 
make and model with a touch of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"When you tune a piano, it's just like being acquainted with someone. The more 
you're around them, the better you know them. It's just like an old friend," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Four decades in the tuning business has taught Smith that each piano has a 
story behind it, as well. He can tell a lot about the people who play them, 
even without meeting them. 
</P>
<P>
"If you see dust on the keys up on this end and down on the lower end, you know 
they haven't touched those keys in years, which indicates they play little, 
simple songs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I sit down at a piano, run my fingers over the keys, I can tell whether 
it's been tuned very often. I can tell if it needs rebuilding or overhauling by 
the way the mechanical part feels."

FASTEST GROWING GAME OF CHANCE IN STATE; 
</P>
<P>
BINGO ORGANIZERS BET ON NORTH DAKOTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

FARGO, N.D. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bingo, once a quaint game played in church basements and fraternal clubs, has 
become such a big business in North Dakota that one city has started cracking 
down on bingo parlors. 
</P>
<P>
Bingo is the fastest growing of a variety of games of chance that the state has 
allowed charitable organizations to run in the last decade. But there is some 
concern that gaming has encouraged problems ranging from cheating and theft to 
excessive gambling. 
</P>
<P>
The bingo action attracts players like Merrlyn Meland, a 58-year-old widow from 
Moorhead, Minn., just across the state line from Fargo. She comes to Fargo 
three or four times a week for the prospect of big money, prizes and 
companionship. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of it is just to get away from the house," she said during a 
recent session. "I can't stand being around that place. I have to get out where 
there's people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finds Company 
</P>
<P>
Meland finds plenty of company at Big Top and Prairie Public Broadcasting, 
which operate the largest of Fargo's five bustling bingo parlors. 
</P>
<P>
Prairie Public, the network for the state's public radio and television 
stations, has had as many as 490 people playing in its modern facility, which 
sports electronic scoreboards and video monitors. Prairie Public uses the funds 
from its gambling operations to run its broadcasting operations. 
</P>
<P>
Bingo, raffles and pull tabs -- a paper simulation of a slot machine -- were 
the first games introduced 12 years ago after North Dakota allowed gambling for 
charitable purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, sports pools, pari-mutuel horse racing, blackjack, poker and video 
poker have been legalized. Ironically, voters have rejected a proposed lottery. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 327 organizations held gambling licenses at 576 sites across the 
state. State regulations list more than 100 ways charitable gambling proceeds 
may be used, including broad categories of educational, religious and fraternal 
activities. Eligible uses also include a category called "other." 
</P>
<P>
Among the organizations supported by bingo or other gambling revenues are 
Bishop Ryan High School in Minot, a Roman Catholic school; the Red River Dance 
and Performing Company in Fargo; and the Souris Valley Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wager $205 Million 
</P>
<P>
Overall, gamblers wagered a record $205 million last year, with $18 million 
going to charitable groups. The state also gets a cut, with taxes ranging up to 
15% of revenues and sales tax charged on bingo cards and some other gaming 
items. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue is welcome in a state with a troubled farm economy. But there are 
also worries that gambling has brought other problems to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Grand Forks City Council voted to limit the number of bingo 
parlors. 
</P>
<P>
Social problems are evident in the number of groups like Gamblers Anonymous, 
said Nicholas Spaeth, the state's attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, you couldn't open up a newspaper in the state and find such a 
group," he said. "But now there isn't a major city in the state that doesn't 
have one." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Theft Becomes Problem 
</P>
<P>
Cheating and theft also have been a problem, although how much goes on is hard 
to determine, Spaeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, bingo is still accepted in most places outside of Grand Forks. 
</P>
<P>
Charities operating the games do not express any qualms that they may be 
encouraging excessive gambling. Spaeth said he expects the bingo business -- 
which grew 28% in 1988 to a total of $41.1 million -- to keep growing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the lure of the big jackpot that draws people in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prairie Public, the biggest bingo operator with revenues of nearly $8.5 million 
last year, offers nightly prizes that include a car and a $20,000 payout to 
anyone who blacks out a card in 50 numbers or fewer.

VERMONT PROGRAM HELPS TEEN-AGERS, LABOR SHORTAGE; 
</P>
<P>
FARMERS REAP BENEFITS OF YOUTH CORPS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Teen-agers Beth Young and Nate Deslandes have no desire to spend their lives 
baling hay and milking cows, but they didn't mind spending the last two months 
in a program intended to give them farm experience while giving farmers a hand. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some problems, but we had some really nice success stories too, and 
we had some farms having some good experiences," said Greg Voorheis, who runs 
the Farm Youth Corps, a pilot program for the state Department of Employment 
and Training. 
</P>
<P>
The corps matched people ages 16 to 21 from northern Vermont with farm jobs. 
The goal was to alleviate a labor shortage while the young people gained 
experience and money for a summer's work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keen Competition 
</P>
<P>
Farmers around the Northeast have especially had trouble hiring help since 
wages at hamburger establishments have risen to $6 or $7 an hour. Few farmers 
can offer more than $4 an hour for harder work, longer days and fewer benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my friends said he knew a kid who said, 'I don't touch a bale for less 
than $7 an hour,' " John Lincoln of Westfield said. 
</P>
<P>
The Farm Youth Corps took care of the problem of finding young people who were 
willing to work for less money. A combination of state and federal funds, plus 
some volunteers, provided training. 
</P>
<P>
The farmers pay their hired hands $4 an hour, and state funds will pay the 
youths a $1-an-hour bonus at the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grew Out of Survey 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the corps came out of a survey of Vermont's 2,500 dairy farms. 
More than one-third of the 700 respondents said a lack of employees kept them 
from expanding. Nearly two-thirds said they would consider hiring young 
Vermonters for the summer if the state would help find them. 
</P>
<P>
Young, 17, hooked up with Jim Jones, a Craftsbury farmer. 
</P>
<P>
"I like being outdoors and I've been around a farm," said Young, who rides her 
bike 2 1/2 miles to Jones' farm each day. "I like the animals. I think I like 
milking -- it's nice after working hard in the woods all day -- and just joking 
with Jim or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
The experience helped confirm that she had rather not farm for a living. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of hard work and it's stressful," she said. "But I think (the 
corps) is a good idea because farmers need help, and I think kids are a lot 
more willing to work than people think." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8 Leave Program 
</P>
<P>
Most kids. Voorheis said eight of the 20 youths dropped out of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Young's supervisor, Danny Paquin, said one girl dropped out because she 
couldn't stand the thought of sending cows and calves to slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
And some couldn't handle a tractor. "One farmer tried to teach one of the kids, 
and he was almost run over himself," Paquin said. 
</P>
<P>
Paquin also had a problem with a young woman who refused to eat from her 
employer's table. 
</P>
<P>
"Her family background -- these people just eat out of cans. We're talking Chef 
Boyardee and Franco American. She wouldn't eat fresh vegetables," Paquin said. 
</P>
<P>
Before going out to the field, 16-year-old Deslandes and the others spent a 
week in classes at a state technical college, where they learned crop and 
livestock management, milking techniques and tractor safety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He's a Convert 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't want to go at first. He didn't think he'd need it," Lincoln said of 
Deslandes. "Now he wants to go back and do more." 
</P>
<P>
"It gives me a lot of experience in mechanics and carpentry and different kinds 
of trades," said Deslandes, of Westfield, whose buddies are spending the summer 
baby-sitting or working in stores. 
</P>
<P>
He also learned about growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"Responsibility. There's a lot of trust, I think, that goes into it," he said. 
"I trust him, he trusts me. I think the responsibility's the No. 1 thing. It 
makes you work a lot harder on goals."

Divorce is on the rise and infidelity is blamed in nearly half of the cases, 
according to court statistics released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 20,345 cases filed with the Supreme Court in 1988, about 90% involved 
couples with children and 47.4% cited infidelity for the breakup. 
</P>
<P>
For this year, the court said 27,778 cases already had been filed by the end of 
July.

AUGUST WAS AN AUTUMNAL ILLUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The merchandise isn't all that's brief this summer at Akbar Afredi's bikini 
stand at Venice Beach. Summer itself has been on the skimpy side. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather has been cool and nobody's been buying," said Afredi, who during 
past summers sold as much as $800 in bikinis on a single hot day. This summer, 
he has gone home at night more than once after selling only one or two 
swimsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"Cool weather is fine for the wintertime, but not the summer," he said last 
week as he marked down his stock, hoping to clean out his 320-suit inventory 
over the Labor Day weekend -- the traditional end of the summer season. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the goose bumps that this summer has given Afredi and other sun 
lovers, the past August on average was only a few degrees cooler than normal in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to remember the most recent weather," said meteorologist Rick Dittmann 
of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times, "so if it's been 
persistently cool for a few weeks, we say, 'Gosh, it's been a cool summer.' " 
</P>
<P>
As if to underscore the point, the mercury took a sharp climb Saturday, 
registering 86 degrees in downtown Los Angeles. Forecasters predicted that the 
temperature would reach 90 Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Still, cloudy morning weather during much of August kept Los Angeles from 
warming like it usually does each afternoon, Dittmann said. The average high 
temperature at the Civic Center during the month was 81.3 degrees, compared to 
a normal maximum reading of 83.7 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The "normal" temperature is calculated on the basis of 30 years of readings 
collected in Los Angeles between 1951 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But, temperatures notwithstanding, it has often felt different, autumn-like 
even, for spells this summer, and this in part is because of morning cloudiness 
caused by a low-pressure trough that extends from Alaska to Southern 
California. The low-pressure area, about 700 miles west of California and about 
20,000 feet up, forms a thick cloud bank -- known as the "marine layer" -- at 
sea level that is pushed inland during nighttime and morning hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That gives the sun less time to heat everything up during the day." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, there were only about 500 people at Zuma Beach west of Malibu. Los 
Angeles County Lifeguard Lt. Roger Smith said a normal hot day would have lured 
up to 60,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Attendance has dropped off the last few weeks. Lots of days, we could shoot a 
cannon down the beach and not hit anyone," he said.

LAUNCHING AN ANTI-NUKE CRUSADE; 
</P>
<P>
DEL MAR ACTIVIST SEES SMALL TOWNS AS STARTING POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Martha Kaye laughs at the thought that, of all things to be doing, she was 
making the bed at her Del Mar home the day inspiration struck like some 
well-guided missile. 
</P>
<P>
She had tuned the television to her favorite evening show -- the "McNeil-Lehrer 
News Hour" -- just for some company. That's when she saw him. That's when the 
55-year-old Kaye sat on the edge of the bed in awed silence. 
</P>
<P>
"There he was, New Zealand's ex-prime minister, David Lange, talking about his 
role in making his country nuclear-free," recalled the mother of three grown 
sons. 
</P>
<P>
"He just sounded so bright and so together, and his solution sounded so 
wonderful, I said, 'There's my guy, and there's my issue.' After the show 
ended, I just sat there on the bed for a while. Then I decided to do something 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
The experience launched Kaye on a self-described one-woman crusade to persuade 
her City Council to follow Lange's lead, to pass a law that would make Del Mar 
the first nuclear-free zone in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Her idea to ban the possession, testing, storage or repair of nuclear weapons 
and their components -- things such as warheads and other strategic weapons 
systems -- would add Del Mar to an elite group of 24 nuclear-free cities in 
California and another 139 communities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a nonprofit environmental group in Baltimore, she studied 
sample nuclear-free zoning ordinances, along with pamphlets on how to approach 
communities on such difficult issues. 
</P>
<P>
She also sought advice from a friend in Washington state who had helped 
initiate a similar ordinance there several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Then, like a well-rehearsed veteran of small-town politics, Kaye personally 
presented her idea to Del Mar's five council members -- several of whom she had 
helped put in office with long hours on their election staffs. 
</P>
<P>
She made telephone calls. She visited homes. She even scouted down one council 
member on the street. Then she officially proposed her idea before a recent 
council session. 
</P>
<P>
But, wait, this is Del Mar -- land of tourists and trifectas, not Trident 
missiles and nuclear triggers. Can she be serious? 
</P>
<P>
The Del Mar City Council apparently thinks so. Later this month, Kaye hopes to 
bear the fruits of her anti-nuclear labor when the council approves her 
suggested ordinance, which has been called a symbolic gesture to "just say no" 
to nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye insists that it's time to take such a stand, that she's not 
</P>
<P>
just some wealthy housewife with a little too much time on her hands. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a zoning ordinance, really, like where do you put the sewer plant or 
how high do you allow your buildings to be built," she said. "One day, I hope 
the whole world can become a nuclear-free zone. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, laws in places like Del Mar are just the beginning. This 
ordinance is just my teeny-weeny contribution to all of this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, in a city where nasty political battles rock the town as regularly 
as the ocean tide, Kaye's idea has met with little resistance. The Del Mar 
Surfcomber, the local paper, even wrote an editorial supporting her position. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the absence of much resistance may reflect the fact that Del Mar is 
not exactly a center of the nuclear weapons industry. Neither Kaye nor any city 
official was aware of any business that might be affected by such an ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council still must hear public response before the ordinance is 
adopted, officials expect little opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously symbolic," said Michael Williams, managing editor of the 
Surfcomber. "But, as Kaye argues, somebody could start up a small nuclear 
industry here. I just thought it was a good idea from a symbolic standpoint of 
promoting peace." 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar Mayor Brooke Eisenberg was another of those won over by Kaye's 
argument. "The city is taking a moral stand," she said. "And I'm proud that 
we're doing it." 
</P>
<P>
But there have been doubters. Former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock recently 
called Eisenberg during his morning radio talk show. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't real keen on the idea," she recalled. "He asked what would happen if 
San Diego decided not to defend Del Mar in the case of a nuclear war. Actually, 
his argument didn't make a whole lot of sense to me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heated Confrontations 
</P>
<P>
Albert Donnay, director of Baltimore's Nuclear Free America, described as a 
nonprofit resource center for nuclear-free zones, said opposition is common -- 
even in liberal areas. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been some heated confrontations in some real liberal places like Palo 
Alto and Sonoma (Calif.), where the issue has been defeated," he said. "When 
you're outspent 20 to 1 by the opposition, you don't stand much chance." 
</P>
<P>
Japan was the first country to declare a nuclear-free status, in 1958, Donnay 
said. In the United States, Hawaii County took such a stand in 1981, leading 
the way for scores of other communities. 
</P>
<P>
Today, in addition to the current 163 nuclear-free zones, another 50 are under 
consideration, including Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the idea is slowly seeping into California suggests that you may 
finally be ready for it out there," Donnay said. 
</P>
<P>
Many communities such as Del Mar are home to companies with military contracts 
that are doing work in the area of the strategic defense initiative, quite 
possibly nuclear-related, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incredulous at Suggestion 
</P>
<P>
Oved Zucker, president of Energy Compression Research Corp., one of two such 
local companies mentioned by Donnay, was incredulous at the suggestion of 
conducting nuclear experiments at the firm's Del Mar offices. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not involved in nuclear materials or components or anything of the 
like," he said of his research and development company, which now has two 
SDI-related military contracts, including one exploring the use of lasers and 
other electrooptics. 
</P>
<P>
"Such nuclear research is done in large facilities, far away from populations, 
not tucked away in little Del Mar." 
</P>
<P>
Martha Kaye is undeterred by the fact that the ordinance would have no direct 
effect on the nuclear weapons industry. 
</P>
<P>
"She's pure dynamite," Washington state resident Lee Sturdivant said of her 
friend. "I have a picture of Marty on my refrigerator, standing on top of Mt. 
Whitney with her hands on her hips, looking like she's sassing God. That's 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Kaye and Sturdivant, both Sierra Club members, have traded notes on evoking 
public support for their anti-nuclear cause, which Sturdivant helped champion 
in her home on San Juan Island several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people initially said, 'Why waste your time trying to prevent nuclear 
war?' " she recalled. "Because we really have no say whatsoever in big things 
like the F-16, the Stealth bomber and the defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
"So when something like this comes off locally, everyone can stand up and 
raspberry the big government. Because that's what it is -- a raspberry." 
</P>
<P>
Kaye didn't waste any time wondering whether other local activists would 
approve of her idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Del Mar is a place that always has its back hairs up about something, so you 
continually have to call up the forces," she said. "Often it's just wasted time 
starting up committees, calling people on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Golly, I can do this by myself.' " 
</P>
<P>
But only in small-town politics, she acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Idea for Everywhere 
</P>
<P>
Kaye said she will assist anyone who wants to start such a movement in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't take on San Diego myself. I think people should do such things for 
their own community. But being nuclear-free is an idea that can be carried 
anywhere -- to a neighborhood, a school, a Kiwanis Club. You could even make 
your own home or office nuclear-free. 
</P>
<P>
"Because winning each little piece of ground is a baby step toward a better 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm nuts about grass-roots politics. It's such a breath of fresh air not to 
have to deal with stuffy politicians on a state or federal level. I think the 
local level is where politicking is most effective." 
</P>
<P>
Kaye has been there before. Besides working behind the scenes on the campaigns 
of several local council members, she has staged battles of her own. She's 
president of the board of Del Mar's farmer's market, which she successfully 
fought developers to establish after the older market closed. 
</P>
<P>
The wife of San Diego Union Associate Editor Peter Kaye, she's one of those 
old-line Del Mar residents who would like to see change come slowly. And she 
doesn't want to see developers' checkbooks do all the talking. 
</P>
<P>
An amateur sculptor, she displays several of her works around her one-story 
house, which looks as if it would have evolved into the landscape by itself if 
given the chance. 
</P>
<P>
But, on this day, the talk isn't of art or the raising of her three sons. It's 
about nuclear holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"Three Mile Island and Chernobyl have been enough to show us that these systems 
are not infallible," she said. "Too many people feel that nuclear weapons are 
protecting us. 
</P>
<P>
"Like many others, I believe they're out to destroy us. It's just an 
ill-thought-out means of defense, a weapon we will one day turn on ourselves."

ZEN SEARCH FOR TRUTH TAKES THE HIGH ROAD UP MT. BALDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of searching goes on out there, Grasshopper. But truth can sneak up on 
you when you least expect it. 
</P>
<P>
Joshu Sasaki, the Mt. Baldy Zen Center's 82-year-old Roshi, or Zen Master, 
rarely talks to outsiders nowadays. Mostly, the venerable spiritual leader 
spends his days in his little wood-slat cabin on the mountain, meditating and 
teaching his students and acolytes according to the oblique methods of Zen 
Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no predicting the Roshi. His students, in the monastery-like 
compound over which Sasaki presides, a former Boy Scout camp on the shoulder of 
the San Gabriel Mountains' highest peak, are often baffled by the master. 
</P>
<P>
"He's difficult to understand sometimes," said one elderly monk during a rare 
idle moment at the Zen Center. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Roshi has agreed to meet an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
This makes administrative director Koyo, who reluctantly leads the visitor 
along a path past towering Douglas firs to the Roshi's cabin, a little 
apprehensive. "I don't know how much you've prepared for this," says Koyo, 42, 
formerly Charles Engennach of Trenton, N.J., "but he probably won't answer a 
lot of academic questions on the nature of Buddhism." 
</P>
<P>
Then Koyo shrugs. "But I don't want to predict what the Roshi will or will not 
say," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Eternal Donkey Hitching Post' 
</P>
<P>
Academically speaking, Zen is a school of Buddhism dating back to the 12th 
Century, when Japanese masters adapted Indian and Chinese meditation techniques 
and moral discipline in the search for transcendental illumination. From the 
Zen perspective, true wisdom is rarely straightforward or capable of being 
expressed objectively. 
</P>
<P>
The serious student seeks to escape "the eternal donkey hitching post" of 
objective language, as one Zen saying puts it, to a transcendental truth that 
can only be expressed in poetry or paradoxical riddles called koans. (Probably 
the most often-repeated koan in the Western world: "What is the sound of one 
hand clapping?") 
</P>
<P>
Sasaki came from Japan to Mt. Baldy 27 years ago, at the beginning of a wave of 
American interest in Zen Buddhism. College students were studying Alan Watts' 
books on Zen, the "beat" writers were waxing freely about Dharma (the sum of 
Buddhist truth), zazen (the Zen form of meditation) and other exotic ideas, and 
the first Japanese teachers were arriving in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, it was come one, come all, and all of us hippies came 
bouncing through the door," said Koyo, a tall, angular man with his head shaved 
and his body wrapped in a black robe. "There was revolution in the air, you 
know?" 
</P>
<P>
Not the sort of bedrock on which to build a movement. By the mid-1970s, despite 
the popularity of a television "Kung Fu" character, who spouted ageless 
Zen-like profundities in the American West, Zen was fading into a broad 
American panorama of cults, churches and pop philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
Those early students, intrigued by Zen thought's challenge to rational thought, 
weren't known for their longevity in the discipline, said Koyo, who has been 
studying Zen since 1971. "Most people get involved for a couple of years," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Zen tide of the 1960s left behind some lasting institutions dedicated 
to the promotion of Zen thought. One of these was Rinzai-Ji, a Los 
Angeles-based national organization, the parent body of the Mt. Baldy center. 
</P>
<P>
The mountain center's faded red, wooden buildings seem to have been sprinkled 
randomly in a hollow 6,000 feet up the mountain, high above the smog line. 
There's a large meditation hall, an eating hall, an office, several dormitories 
and, on a knoll overlooking the camp, the Roshi's cabin. 
</P>
<P>
With its tree-lined vistas and blue skies, the place produces a feeling of 
almost palpable tranquility, outsiders often note. "Walk through the compound 
and you wonder sometimes if anyone's there," said George Duffy, a Forest 
Service officer from the Mt. Baldy district who frequently patrols the road 
past the Zen Center. "They do maintain a real peaceful setting there, with a 
sense of some kind of higher association with the world, like going to a 
convent or a religious shrine." 
</P>
<P>
But there is hard work going on there too, under a system of rigorous 
discipline. The Roshi's students -- there are 23 of them, including monks 
engaged in long-term studies and uninitiated novices who are here for the 
summer -- get up every morning at 3. Their day is filled with tasks (such as 
building a retaining wall, putting a new roof on the shower house or cooking), 
meditation, one-on-one brainstorming with their master and silence. 
</P>
<P>
"Banter, chatting, wondering what's going to happen tomorrow -- that's all 
considered a distraction from the reality that's being expressed," said Koyo. 
Bedtime is at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Otherworldly Realms 
</P>
<P>
Koyo shows you the main meditation hall, a long unadorned room, with benches 
along the walls and cushions on which students perch in the cross-legged lotus 
position. 
</P>
<P>
In meditation it is easy to "drift into otherworldly kinds of realms," said 
Koyo. The meditation leader, a senior member of the group, sometimes polices 
the hall with a long, flat stick with which he brings dreamers and fidgeters 
back to the task at hand. Transgressions are met with stinging whacks with the 
stick, or keisaka, on the muscle of each shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Meditation, a way of heightening awareness, is central to Zen. "It's not 
thought," Koyo said. "In some ways, thought interferes with meditation. You 
need to direct it into its deeper expressions." Ideally, he adds, the awareness 
that comes from meditation carries over to other activities. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a year, the center holds weeklong sesshins, or retreats, when students 
spend hours at a time in meditation. The mid-year sesshin has recently ended. 
"Don't you notice my glow?" said Koyo. 
</P>
<P>
A monk knocks two wooden blocks together, summoning the students for a short 
pre-luncheon meditation. They meditate for 10 minutes, then walk single file, 
wordlessly, to the dining hall, where they eat a meal of mashed potatoes (with 
margarine) and lettuce-and-radish salad. 
</P>
<P>
After the meal, several have time to speak to the visitor. One introduces 
himself as Dogo, a former teamster and welterweight boxer from New York. What 
brought him to the Zen Center? "It's a big, long, sloppy story," said Dogo, 63, 
who was known in his earlier life as Pat Scanlon. 
</P>
<P>
"After I quit boxing (in 1948), everything sort of went sour," said Dogo, a 
bespectacled man who squints in the sun like someone who has just awakened from 
a refreshing sleep. "I started using drugs, my wife got in trouble over me and 
she left me alone with the baby." 
</P>
<P>
After three years of fruitless psychoanalysis, Dogo read a book by the Zen 
interpreter Shunryu Suzuki and looked up "Zen" in the Manhattan telephone book. 
He wound up at the Zen Institute in New York in 1967. He has been at the Mt. 
Baldy center for three years, where Roshi Sasaki has brought him contentment, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave me a chance to earn $1 million in gold coins every day," Dogo said 
with twinkling eyes. "But I'm talking too much about myself. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
What koan is he meditating on now? Dogo holds his eyes shut tight, as if to 
make sure he gets it right. "How do I realize my family 2,700 miles away?" he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Roshi's meeting room is a small sitting area with a table and four 
mismatched chairs. Zen writers have referred to meetings with Zen masters as 
entering the lion's den, because of the vigorous exchanges they inspire with 
their students. But Roshi Sasaki, a small, sunny man who smiles hospitably, is 
far from leonine. 
</P>
<P>
He jokes good-naturedly about his age. "Eating is difficult," he says, speaking 
a thickly accented English. "Sometimes the fork falls down." He says he sleeps 
from three to seven hours a day. "But meditation is a good resting position," 
he said. His students, most of them white Americans, are very serious about 
their studies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Where does one begin to learn Zen? "Breathing," he said enigmatically. Pressed 
to talk about deeper issues, Sasaki speaks at length about the paradox of the 
duality of life. (A traditional saying puts it like this: "One moon shows in 
every pool; in every pool the one moon.") 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'True Love' 
</P>
<P>
"Real God is God nobody knows," said Sasaki. "Father not real father, mother 
not real mother. Real parent is one." He holds his two hands up, then clasps 
them in front of his face. "Father, mother completely become one. It is true 
love. Everything is my brother." 
</P>
<P>
Reality, he said, is "beyond subject and object, beyond knowing and 
expression." How does man transcend reality? "Practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the Roshi's accent is impenetrable, with extra syllables rolling out, 
like stones falling from an overloaded truck. His voice rises and fades. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no objective human," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, an amused Koyo said the Roshi often intentionally mumbles and 
mispronounces. "There's a lot going on that he's interested in besides just the 
words," said Koyo. "The most poignant moments in our lives are often silent." 
</P>
<P>
The Roshi's way of talking -- is it a strategy to inspire the student to think 
harder? 
</P>
<P>
Koyo smiles craftily. "What do you think?" he said.

MONEY WOES PLAGUE DIRECTOR OF L. A. / AFRICA TASK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Personal financial problems -- including bankruptcy filings, foreclosure 
threats and tax liens -- have dogged the head of Mayor Tom Bradley's 
scandal-plagued Africa task force since the mayor first secured city funding 
for the trade group four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, The Times has found, none of those officially associated with 
the task force -- not the mayor, his staff, task force board members or 
officers -- assumed responsibility for supervising Juanita St. John, director 
of the Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations. 
</P>
<P>
The result, according to records and interviews, was that, while St. John 
wrestled with mounting personal financial problems, there were virtually no 
checks on how she managed a $400,000 infusion of city funds. 
</P>
<P>
City and state officials now are investigating St. John's handling of public 
funds, which allegedly were commingled with personal funds in St. John family 
checking accounts. City auditors specifically want to know what happened to 
$180,000 in unaccounted-for withdrawals made by St. John. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On-Call Advisory Group 
</P>
<P>
Richard Parsons, an oil company executive, chaired the Bradley-appointed task 
force board in recent years, but insisted the panel had no executive 
responsibilities. "Juanita St. John is the task force," Parsons said. "The 
board is merely an advisory group that remains on call." 
</P>
<P>
The task force listed Parsons in state corporation records as the 
organization's president, but he told The Times he never held the post and was 
unaware he was registered as a corporate officer. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Bradley say supervising St. John and watching expenditures was not the 
mayor's responsibility. They maintain it was up to the city controller's 
auditors and task force board members to ensure funds were spent properly. "Why 
else do you have a board?" asked Deputy Mayor Michael Gage. 
</P>
<P>
The task force -- intended to promote stronger business and cultural ties 
between the city and Africa -- has been a pet project of Bradley's since he 
helped create it in 1978. He regularly attended board meetings, strongly 
defended it against critics at UCLA, where it was housed, and at City Hall, 
where it received most of its funds since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA officially referred to it as the "mayor's" task force. Bradley -- who is 
not registered as a corporate officer -- signed a key contract with UCLA on 
behalf of the nonprofit corporation. Later the university turned to Bradley and 
his staff in 1986 and 1988 after the task force repeatedly overdrew its account 
-- perhaps the first sign of task force financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has declined to comment on the task force because of the pending 
investigations by the city controller, city attorney and the state attorney 
general. St. John and her attorneys declined to be interviewed for this 
article, but in the past she has denied misusing taxpayers' money and said she 
can produce records to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arraignment This Month 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office has filed criminal charges against St. John, saying 
she failed to supply subpoenaed records. She will be arraigned later this 
month. A city audit of the task force is expected to be released next week. 
</P>
<P>
St. John and the mayor are friends, professional associates and business 
partners. In addition to supporting the Africa task force, Bradley has hired 
St. John's daughter, Kathy, to work in his office. Bradley also is a partner in 
a Riverside County land venture with St. John, her daughter and several other 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
St. John had both professional and personal financial problems when Bradley won 
the first infusion of city funds for the task force in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The task force was struggling. Federal and university grants that had paid St. 
John's salary were drying up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Problems 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, records and interviews show, St. John had growing personal 
financial problems. A collection agency won a court judgment against her. An 
insurance company was suing St. John's husband to collect on a $65,000 bounced 
check. And a mortgage company was threatening to foreclose on her home. 
</P>
<P>
St. John and her husband, John, managed to fend of creditors and stay afloat by 
borrowing money, mostly against the equity in their Spanish-style, two-story 
home in north San Marino, recently valued at $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
But as her debts continued to mount and, after a recent foreclosure action, St. 
John filed for bankruptcy. Last month a U.S. bankruptcy judge granted her 
permission to borrow another $250,000 against the house to pay off several 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
News reports about St. John's problems with the handling of Africa task force 
financial matters have a familiar ring for Ed Kaleff, a neighbor two doors down 
from the St. Johns. "That's Juanita," he said. "She tells me the same thing. . 
. . I keep getting promised month by month . . . the check's in the mail." 
</P>
<P>
Kaleff said he lent St. John about $32,000 two years ago after spotting a 
notice in the local paper that her house was in foreclosure. "I did it because 
she was a very pleasant person. I . . . knew them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
St. John said she was in a temporary bind; a mix-up had cut off her husband's 
retirement income, Kaleff recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But after "many, many" efforts to get St. John to repay the loan, Kaleff filed 
his own foreclosure action, now tied up in the bankruptcy case. 
</P>
<P>
Several of those who worked with St. John on task force business, and attended 
parties at her home for visiting African artists and dignitaries, said they had 
no inkling of her personal financial problems until her bankruptcy was reported 
recently. "Not at all," said Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, Bradley has had a financial interest with St. John in a Riverside 
real estate partnership. The partnership was organized by then-UCLA Vice 
Chancellor Charles Z. Wilson. Now publisher of the Wave newspapers in South Los 
Angeles, Wilson is a Bradley friend who helped the mayor organize the task 
force at the university. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the personal financial relationship, Gage, after checking with the 
mayor, said Bradley did not know about St. John's financial problems until 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and St. John's relationship developed through the formation of the task 
force 11 years ago, Gage said. The mayor recalled meeting St. John once before 
that at a UCLA event, and Bradley was not initially involved in selecting her 
for the task force job, Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
A one-time string musician who friends say played with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, St. John worked in various mid-level administrative assistant 
jobs since 1965, including a stint as a Peace Corps coordinator. For several 
years before the formation of the task force, she served as an assistant to the 
director of the university's Africa Studies Center. 
</P>
<P>
When the university agreed to Bradley's request to form the group, the job of 
pulling it together was assigned to St. John. 
</P>
<P>
She seemed a logical choice, associates said. She was well-traveled and 
well-connected in Africa and she had a reputation for juggling challenging 
staff assignments, notably the difficult logistics of university academic tours 
through Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"She could handle things . . . she was very creative," recalled Prof. Boniface 
Obichere, a former Africa Studies Center director and St. John's boss for much 
of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old St. John -- described by friends and associates as "charming," 
"gregarious," "committed" -- dived into the task force work and soon was 
assigned to the project full time, and moved to a separate suite of offices, 
where she worked for Wilson. One of her first tasks was to arrange a trip for 
Bradley and a group of businessmen to Africa. She also helped bring a Nigerian 
art exhibition to the county's Museum of Natural History and organized local 
business seminars. 
</P>
<P>
But tensions quickly began to build between the African Studies Center, which 
oversees most of the university's Africa-related programs, and St. John, who 
was running the task force independently. "I could not discern any potential 
for benefit to the university," said Prof. Peter Hammond, one of several 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said the educational aspects of the task force were never clear and 
housing it on campus took away scarce resources and space from other needy 
programs. "I think they wanted to accommodate the mayor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict came to head in early 1985, when separate delegations from the 
task force and the Africa Studies Center arrived in Liberia. "The left hand 
didn't know what the right hand was doing," Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
As the controversy escalated, Bradley strongly defended the task force in an 
exchange of letters with university faculty members -- at one point being moved 
to declare his pet project was not "an embarrassment to UCLA, nor any 
government." 
</P>
<P>
But with the departure of Wilson in 1984, university and federal support lapsed 
and the mayor turned to the city for "interim" funding to keep his task force 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the mayor felt if they could (get) one or two years of funding, then 
the federal government would be more interested in coming in," Wilson said. "It 
didn't quite work out that way." 
</P>
<P>
After winning a city budget fight over the funds, Bradley signed an agreement 
on behalf of the task force with the university. Among other things, it called 
for city funds to go to the task force, with a portion to be deposited in a 
UCLA account that would pay St. John's $40,000-a-year salary and other 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The new financial arrangement gave St. John considerably more latitude over the 
financial affairs of the group. University accountants were no longer 
overseeing the task force's expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no administrative authority over it," said Harlan Lebo, a UCLA 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Just who did have administrative authority over St. John was not specified. "I 
really couldn't tell you," said Robert Gordon, a bank executive and task force 
member. "It never came up in any of our meetings." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attended Meetings 
</P>
<P>
Other board members say that while Bradley frequently attended board meetings, 
he rarely initiated discussions about policy matters. 
</P>
<P>
University records show there was trouble in St. John's handling of the city 
funds almost immediately. The UCLA account was overdrawn within months of the 
city's release of the first $100,000 in summer of 1985. The problem would 
repeat itself several times and a year later frustrated university officials 
contacted the mayor's office for help. 
</P>
<P>
But Gage said Bradley only learned of the problem last year, when a vice 
chancellor wrote him directly to complain about the task force and "these 
irritating problems (that) continue to persist." Gage said that the overdraw 
problem appeared to be resolved, and Bradley did not see it as a signal of 
larger financial problems with the task force. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, sources said, some of Bradley's staff did have concerns about 
the task force -- the political heat it generated each year when critics on the 
City Council questioned whether it should be funded. But aware of Bradley's 
dedication to the project and his support of St. John, no one on his staff 
raised objections, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until April of this year when the investigations of the task force 
and St. John were under way that Bradley withdrew his task force funding 
request for $121,000. 
</P>
<P>
The task force office is now closed, the program is in limbo and UCLA says the 
group still owes it $40,000.

I'm convinced. I've been convinced ever since the first time I landed a jet 
fighter at Lindbergh Field (1959)! San Diego does need a better and much safer 
international airport. 
</P>
<P>
There's a logical solution staring us in the face. The "center of population" 
of those who fly with the airlines is on the north side of San Diego, not on 
the south side, near Brown Field. But, the Navy needs and will not give up 
Miramar Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
So, let's do the obvious: use the money for a new international airport to 
upgrade and construct a new "Miramar NAS" at (and perhaps just north of) Brown 
Field. Build new family housing, the "works." 
</P>
<P>
Then the only logical site for our new airport becomes available, Miramar.

CRASH INVOLVING OFFICER CLAIMS LIFE OF 3RD MAN; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY DESCRIBES POLICEMAN AS SOMEONE WHO WOULD NEVER MIX DRINKING, DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An automobile accident involving an off-duty San Diego policeman claimed a 
third life Saturday when a 40-year-old Pacific Beach man died of injuries 
suffered in the Imperial Valley crash. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Walker was pronounced dead at 6:40 a.m. in the intensive-care unit of 
UC San Diego Medical Center, where he had been flown by Life Flight with severe 
head and chest injuries, according to acting supervisor Sally Shepherd. He was 
taken off life support Friday afternoon, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker was one of three passengers in a four-wheel-drive station wagon driven 
by 28-year-old Kevin Rausis, a seven-year San Diego police veteran assigned to 
the department's traffic unit. 
</P>
<P>
Rausis was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter 
after his 1988 Toyota 4-Runner overturned late Thursday eastbound Interstate 8 
within the city limits of El Centro, according to the California Highway 
Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Others Killed in Crash 
</P>
<P>
Also killed in the one-car crash were Rausis' brother, Kenneth Richard Rausis, 
38, of University City, and his brother-in-law, John Leonard Walker, 27, of 
East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Rausis was a painter for San Diego Transit Corp., where he had worked for 
15 years. The younger Walker was an engineer at Rohr Industries, according to 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Kevin Rausis was back home in San Diego, awaiting results of 
blood-alcohol tests. No charges have been filed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably won't get any results until the end of the week," said Sgt. John 
Ploetz, a CHP spokesman. "So right now, we're all in limbo on this thing." 
</P>
<P>
If Rausis' blood-alcohol level exceeds 0.10% -- the limit allowed by law -- 
felony charges of drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter will probably be 
recommended to the Imperial County district attorney, Ploetz said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Rausis, Ken Rausis' wife, spoke with Kevin Rausis on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time the four had done anything together, so they were 
having a good time, talking about hunting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were listening to a George Strait song on the tape player. Ken wanted to 
hear the song again but couldn't work the player, so Kevin started messing with 
it. That's when the accident happened." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Rausis swerved to avoid a slower-moving car and his vehicle overturned, 
ejecting the Walker brothers, who were riding in a rear jump seat without seat 
belts, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers on the scene detected an odor of alcohol and an empty beer bottle. An 
ice chest filled with beer that had reportedly been stored inside the pickup 
was also found scattered across the highway, according to the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, family members described Kevin Rausis as a cautious professional 
who would never mix drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known Kevin a long time, and I've never seen him drink more than one beer 
at a time," said Bernice Gagel, Linda's mother. "He was just too cautious, too 
concerned with his career. But they're all condemning him just because a beer 
cooler was found inside the truck." 
</P>
<P>
She said the Rausis brothers were particularly close and the group had been 
anticipating the hunting trip for some time. "You had four men who were looking 
forward to this hunting trip. The hunting was really just an excuse. They 
wanted to get together, let their hair down." 
</P>
<P>
Gagel said the group was within half a mile of where they planned to spend the 
night when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"They were going to stop in El Centro to sleep, that's how cautious they were. 
Neither one of those brothers would have allowed an open beer in that truck. 
They would have waited until they got where they were staying for the night 
before drinking." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Rausis said that although her late husband was 10 years older than his 
brother, the two worked hard to stay close. "Ken always played the big brother 
role and Kevin looked up to him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fishing Fanatic 
</P>
<P>
Ken Rausis, a fishing fanatic, recently bought his younger brother a tackle box 
in the hopes of interesting him in the sport, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Rausis, who was married in May, on Saturday morning returned his older 
brother's pickup truck to his sister-in-law, Linda. Ken Rausis had left his 
vehicle at his younger brother's home near San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium when 
they started on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he just wanted to be alone," said Gagel, Linda's mother. "He's 
devastated. His eyes show just how much pain he's going through. He knows he 
has to live with this all his life." 
</P>
<P>
Rausis spoke with family members, including Linda. Ken and Linda Rausis have a 
son, Zachary, who celebrated his 15-month birthday the day his father died. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for Kevin to face everybody," Gagel said. "He gave me a hug and 
said, 'I'm sorry. I'm just so sorry.' It was all he could say."

BATTY THEORY ON EVOLUTIONARY LINK CREATES MINOR FLAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holy Batroots! Is it really true, as some scientists suggest, that human beings 
and bats might be distant cousins who share the same primeval ancestors? Is 
there a Batman or Count Dracula lurking in each of us? 
</P>
<P>
In the heat of this summer's batmania, with American moviegoers breaking 
box-office records to see "Batman," anything seems possible. 
</P>
<P>
The National Zoo's bat expert, John Seidensticker, says it is an intriguing 
theory, one you could sink your teeth into, but he's not sure that he believes 
it. Other scientists at the Smithsonian Institution scoff at the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Seidensticker says brain studies have yielded evidence that certain kinds of 
large bats found in Africa and the South Pacific may be descendants of 
prehistoric primates akin to lemurs or mouse-like shrews. 
</P>
<P>
"The theory is that these bats are really flying primates," he says, and 
connected somehow in the evolutionary chain to the early primate ancestors of 
monkeys, apes, gorillas -- and humans. 
</P>
<P>
But Charles Handley, a leading authority on bats and other mammals at the 
Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, says this theory is a "hot 
potato" of scientific controversy that has won few adherents. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what the ancestors of bats really were," Handley said. 
</P>
<P>
The 160 fluttering bats in the National Zoo's new Bat Cave aren't talking. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they do not display the slightest familial interest in their supposed 
two-legged cousins who stare intently through a glass wall into their dimly 
lighted hideaway of damp rocks and hollow tree trunks. 
</P>
<P>
Keeper Carol Prima, who wears a Batman baseball cap, says the bats have never 
bothered her. "They're not aggressive," she said. "If anything, they're just 
curious." 
</P>
<P>
They hover watchfully while she scrubs the cave walls or delivers their meals. 
The bats, three species of fruit eaters, consume 30 pounds of grapes, melons, 
bananas and a gruel of peach nectar and vitamins every day. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the time they fly back and forth, socialize in their "harems" and 
just hang out. Or, more precisely, hang down. They also have active sex lives. 
</P>
<P>
"They're continuously producing babies," Seidensticker says. 
</P>
<P>
Prima says she has never felt threatened working in the Bat Cave.

VAST MAJORITY THINK BERNSON SWAYED BY DEVELOPER DONATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
By a 7-to-1 margin, San Fernando Valley residents expressing an opinion believe 
that Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson is influenced by the developers of 
the massive Porter Ranch residential and commercial plan in his 12th District, 
last weekend's Times Poll found. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, Bernson has received about $50,000 in campaign contributions from 
Porter Ranch developers and their hired consultants. He also chairs the City 
Council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee, which will decide this 
month whether the plan to build 3,000 residences and nearly 6 million square 
feet of commercial and office space should go forward. 
</P>
<P>
Poll respondents were told that critics, including opponents of the Porter 
Ranch project and California Common Cause, believe that Bernson has a conflict 
of interest on the issue. They were also told that council President John 
Ferraro has determined that Bernson does not have a conflict and that he has 
conducted himself objectively at public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether they thought that Bernson was influenced by the developers, 
57% of those polled said they thought that he was. Only 8% said he was not, and 
35% said they did not know. In Bernson's district, 61% of the respondents said 
he was influenced by Porter Ranch developers, and only 7% said he was not. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Legal Bribes' 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 56% of those polled said they agreed that campaign contributions 
are little more than "legal bribes." 
</P>
<P>
"These figures indicate that Bernson has a conflict of interest in the opinion 
of many people in the Valley," said I. A. (Bud) Lewis, director of The Times 
Poll. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said it was "grossly unfair" to imply that he had "received $50,000 
from people in connection with the Porter Ranch plan." 
</P>
<P>
He said the contributions came from a variety of consultants and other 
companies that do business with Shapell Industries, the key Porter Ranch 
developer. But he said the contributions were spread over the past seven years, 
beginning even before a Bernson-appointed Citizens Advisory Committee began 
reviewing the Porter Ranch plan. He also said his campaign committee, to avoid 
the appearance of impropriety, had returned a $500 donation that Shapell made 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make polls sound like anything you want," Bernson said. "It is no 
wonder that people think that politicians are dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said he had never made a decision based on whether a developer was a 
contributor or a supporter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've been a very responsible elected official," he said. "I've 
listened to people and I always try to do what's best for the community." 
</P>
<P>
A conservative Republican first elected to the council in 1979, Bernson is 
nonetheless generally viewed as a moderate who has twice won reelection by 
substantial margins. He has supported some developments but has opposed others, 
such as the office complex that a developer wanted to build earlier this year 
on the site of Northridge Little League's baseball fields. In February, he 
proposed that developers seeking to build in a large section of Northridge be 
subjected to City Council requirements to provide parking and street 
improvements to reduce traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Poll respondents gave Bernson's performance a mixed mark, with most saying they 
did not know enough to judge him. Bernson was viewed favorably by 22% of those 
polled in his district and was viewed unfavorably by 21%. Those numbers are 
subject to a higher margin of error -- plus or minus 9 percentage points -- 
than other poll results because only 210 of those polled were in Bernson's 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson is also the target of a fledgling recall effort, backed by Northridge 
businessman Walter N. Prince. Prince is opposed to a Bernson plan to designate 
about 80 acres on Parthenia Street as a redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely think he's biased in favor of developers," Prince said. "He 
continues to ignore whatever the voters want. He was elected to represent the 
people and he doesn't even attempt to represent them." 
</P>
<P>
Prince said the Porter Ranch project is a key example. The Times Poll found 
that 63% of those in Bernson's district oppose the plan, while only 27% favor 
it. Bernson supports the plan on the grounds that its large size will allow the 
city to require the developer to spend between $80 million and $100 million to 
build a fire station, library and parks and to make significant improvements to 
streets and to the Simi Valley Freeway.

BOTCHED HEIST LED TO DEATH, JURIES TOLD

What began as an "easy money" scheme by a disgruntled former gas station 
employee turned into a bungled armed robbery that left an Inglewood police 
officer dead, the prosecution said as a murder trial opened in Torrance 
Superior Court on Friday for two defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Joevone Elster, 24, and Van Otis Wilson, 22, both of Los Angeles, have pleaded 
not guilty to murder and robbery charges that could bring them 25 years to life 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Lenhart said the "evil plot" unfolded on March 31, 
1988 when five friends took two cars to the gas station at Manchester Boulevard 
and Ash Avenue in Los Angeles. They waited there until about 10 a.m., when 
Masih Modani, a money courier, drove up to the station, collected the cash 
receipts and headed down Manchester into Inglewood. The five followed Modani, 
forced him to stop his car and robbed him at gunpoint, Lenhart said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the holdup, Sgt. George Aguilar, an undercover narcotics 
investigator, drove by, picked up Modani and began pursuing the defendants. As 
he pulled up next to Modani's stolen car in an attempt to cut it off, shots 
rang out and Aguilar was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the bullet that killed Aguilar, the first Inglewood police officer 
to be murdered in the line of duty in the department's 81-year history, was 
fired by Leslie Holget of Los Angeles. Police say Holget died that night after 
he led officers on a 45-mile chase that ended when he pulled to the side of the 
road in Newhall and shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
Although police say Elster and Wilson did not pull the trigger that killed 
Aguilar, they are charged with his murder because he died in the course of the 
robbery in which they were allegedly involved. 
</P>
<P>
The other two involved in the heist have already been convicted of murder. A 
16-year-old juvenile was found guilty of robbery and first-degree murder last 
year and was sentenced to the California Youth Authority until he is 25. 
Patrick Anthony Carr, 21, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in June and 
agreed to testify in the trial of Elster and Wilson. He will be sentenced later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
While forgoing opening statements, attorneys for the defendants offered sketchy 
details of their defense in interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"My man was not involved," said Robert A. Welbourn, the attorney for Elster. 
Welbourn said Elster was in a separate car and was not at the scene of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce McCaslin, Wilson's attorney, said his client, although he was in the car 
with Holget, did not kill Aguilar. McCaslin suggested that the robbery had 
already ended when Aguilar was shot and only the deceased Holget can be held 
responsible for the officer's death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Robbery Planned for Weeks 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear from the evidence that Holget fired the gun that killed Sgt. 
Aguilar," McCaslin said. 
</P>
<P>
In the prosecution's opening statement, Lenhart told two separate juries, one 
for each defendant, that Elster planned the robbery several weeks after he had 
been fired from a cashier's position there. 
</P>
<P>
Leonhardt gave this account: 
</P>
<P>
Elster recruited the others to rob the station. After staking it out for three 
days, the defendants on March 31 followed Modani's car down Manchester 
Boulevard in two vehicles. Holget and Wilson forced Modani out of his car at 
gunpoint at the intersection of Manchester and Eucalyptus Avenue. The men stole 
Modani's car and fled in the three vehicles with more than $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the robbery, Modani spotted Aguilar, whom he knew as an occasional 
customer at the station, and flagged him down. Aguilar, a 15-year veteran, 
radioed for help and pursued the robbers with Modani in the passenger seat of 
his unmarked police car. 
</P>
<P>
As the cars sped south on La Brea Avenue, Aguilar tried to pull alongside 
Modani's stolen vehicle at Arbor Vitae Street and was hit in the chest by 
gunfire that passed through the car's door. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was found by police soon afterward, hiding in the stairway of a nearby 
apartment complex with the stolen money. Elster was arrested after he contacted 
KTLA reporter Warren Wilson and arranged to give himself up to officials of the 
Los Angeles district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's first witness Friday was Aguilar's widow, Rebecca, who 
testified that her husband left the house early that morning to attend a police 
training seminar after saying goodby to her and the couple's young son, 
Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
' . . . He Was Dead' 
</P>
<P>
When asked when she saw her husband next, Rebecca Aguilar began crying. "I saw 
him in the hospital, and he was dead," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On a request from the defense, Judge John P. Shook asked Rebecca Aguilar to 
remain on call as a witness and therefore not observe the proceedings, a move 
that Leonhardt later called "a ruse to keep her out of the presence of the 
jury." 
</P>
<P>
The judge also granted a pretrial motion by the prosecution to exclude any 
mention of the cause of Holget's death. 
</P>
<P>
The dual juries, a technique used occasionally with multiple defendants, were 
impaneled at the request of the prosecution in order to combine two trials 
while ensuring that evidence relevant to one defendant does not prejudice the 
other defendant's case. Lawyers said the defendants may testify against each 
other, and in such an instance one jury would be removed from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Elster will be tried simultaneously for an unrelated attempted 
robbery that occurred at a private home on Edgehill Drive in Los Angeles 10 
days before the gas station robbery. Evidence relating to the attempted robbery 
will not be heard by the jury for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers said the trial, which will resume Wednesday, could continue for several 
weeks.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: AN AVERAGE DAY AT THE HAMBURGER STAND: COOKING BURGERS, 
TALKING TO THE GUYS, APPEARING ON RADIO.

Hawthorne, long known as the home of the Beach Boys, can add another name to 
its list of local luminaries. 
</P>
<P>
This celebrity, however, does not sing or act. In fact, the new local hero is 
not even a person. What has got people in Hawthorne oohing and ahing is a 
hamburger. Yes, a slab of ground beef on a toasted bun. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the burgers served at Sam's Place, a small mom-and-pop joint on 
Hawthorne Boulevard, have been praised by locals as the best in town. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, Ken Minyard and Bob Arthur, KABC's morning radio team, 
visited Sam's Place to find out for themselves what all the fuss was about. The 
visit, part of the station's search for the best burgers in the Los Angeles 
area, brought out a crowd of onlookers and some of the city's notables. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was Mayor Betty J. Ainsworth, who presented Ken and Bob with a key 
to the city. Police Chief Stephen R. Port dropped in to chat with KABC 
restaurant critic Elmer Dills, and Miss Hawthorne for 1988-89, Anna Marsella, 
stopped by in her crown and satin sash. 
</P>
<P>
After shaking a few hands, making a few jokes for their radio audience and 
taking a few bites from the renowned burgers, the radio celebrities left to 
continue their search at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
Only a glimmer of the spotlight fell on the real story behind the burgers: Sam 
and Phyllis Weiner, the owners of Sam's Place, who have been flipping patties 
and taking orders for almost 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis, 66, a gray-haired dynamo at the grill or taking orders, is friendly 
and spirited and has been known to wear shorts and a Batman T-shirt to work. 
When they opened their place in 1965, she said, Sam didn't know the first thing 
about frying burgers and she had never waited on tables. But they learned as 
they went along. 
</P>
<P>
Sam, a 72-year-old former bartender who wears a white Panama hat, spends most 
of his time serving beers and knows many of his regular customers by name. 
Asked what accounts for the longevity and success of his restaurant, he shrugs. 
"Dumbness," he says as he wipes the bar with a towel. "I should have sold the 
place a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis gives Sam a disapproving look from across the bar. "We put out a good 
burger," she says. "We fry it properly with tender loving care." 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis' daughter, Sharon, 41, waits tables alongside her mother, and Sharon's 
son, 13-year-old Levi Brett, occasionally takes orders too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a family business," Phyllis says. "I wouldn't have stayed with it this 
long if it weren't for the people." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the customers at Sam's Place have been regulars for years. Peggy and 
Carl Willison, who have lived in Hawthorne since 1958, said they have 
frequented Sam's Place for years. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Willison said there are "good people" at Sam's Place, and she describes 
the burgers as "beautiful, the best in town." 
</P>
<P>
Friday, after the crowd had dispersed and the radio celebrities had moved on, 
business was back to normal. Phyllis rushed around taking orders and Sam was 
out front chatting with some customers. 
</P>
<P>
They agreed that all the attention given to their burgers may boost business 
but would not change them. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight I'll be the same old thing," Sam said, "cooking burgers, talking to 
the guys at the bar and maybe telling a few dirty jokes." 
</P>
<P>
Said Phyllis: "We'll always stay the same." Hugo Martin

Sweet fennel sometimes announces its presence ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
From around the bend on a mountain road or around the corner on an urban block 
comes the smell of anise. 
</P>
<P>
When the turn is accomplished, the source is confirmed: a tall cluster of 
stalks with branches of fern-like leaves and crowned with airy light-yellow 
snowflakes of blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
Naturalized from Europe long ago, sweet fennel, a perennial herb, is usually 
from 3 feet to more than 8 feet tall and blooms from May to September. 
</P>
<P>
All parts of it are aromatic, including the stalks, which are bluish-green with 
a silvery sheen that is easily wiped off with a finger that becomes suddenly 
fragrant. 
</P>
<P>
Crushing the flowers or leaves or seeds intensifies the scent. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the early missionaries, it is said, harnessed this property by 
spreading sweet fennel in the church aisles. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the carrot family, sweet fennel bears the Latin name of Foeniculum 
vulgare. 
</P>
<P>
Foeniculum means "small hay," and probably derives from the plant's scent; 
vulgare means common. 
</P>
<P>
The leaves, which are sheathed at the base, can be cooked as a vegetable or 
used in sauces. 
</P>
<P>
Some leaves make up the ingredients of today's French and Italian cuisine.

BUILDING AIMS FOR NEW IMAGE WITH MURAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The challenge: Transform the ugliest building in San Diego into a work of art. 
The result: A nine-story, three-dimensional mural, complete with swaying palm 
trees and the Spirit of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The building is the year-old Ramada Hotel on K Street, in downtown San Diego. 
Designed and built by Concrete Dynamics, the 22-story hotel has been described 
by an architectural critic as "a building that brutally assaults the street and 
robs the neighborhood of its scale and humanity." 
</P>
<P>
After the building garnered an "Onion" at last year's "Orchids and Onions" 
architecture awards ceremony, hotel owner Clark Higgins decided the building 
needed some dressing up. So he put out the call for an artist to design a 
mural. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Hobson, former director of the county's Public Arts Advisory Council, 
organized an international competition, 
</P>
<P>
whichattracted more than 40 entries from San Diego, Los Angeles and Mexico. A 
panel of five artists and consultants selected San Diegan Mario Uribe's design 
depicting the legendary "Spirit of St. Louis" flying through a window-like 
opening in the wall of the building. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some entries that were different, to say the least," said Dale 
Vogelaar, the hotel's director of sales and marketing. "But Mario's design is 
really dramatic. When we put the lights on the mural, it really looks like the 
Spirit of St. Louis is flying through the side of the building." 
</P>
<P>
The mural is a trompe l'oeil rendering, meaning Uribe used optical illusion 
techniques to attract the viewer's eye. His inspiration for the design came 
from "The Spirit of St. Louis," a movie starring Jimmy Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
The original Spirit of St. Louis was built in San Diego by Ryan Aeronautical 
for Charles Lindbergh's historic 1927 Atlantic crossing. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to bring some of the sky back that the building might have taken 
away," Uribe said. "This mural opens up a window, in a sense, and improves the 
architecture of the building at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
The mural was done by Muralizing, a local company owned by Linda Churchill and 
her husband, Nicholas Weiss. Suspended from the hotel's roof, the couple and 
two assistants took more than 1,000 hours to complete the work, which covers a 
210-by-70-foot portion of the hotel's northern wall. 
</P>
<P>
The project cost Higgins about $40,000, Vogelaar said, including Uribe's 
$30,000 prize and Muralizing's production costs. 
</P>
<P>
The giant mural will be unveiled at 7 p.m. Thursday.

WATER SUPPLY SITUATION CALLS FOR LEVELHEADEDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Clemente City Council, responding to a severe shortage in the city 
water reservoir, has drafted what experts have called the toughest 
water-rationing law in the state. But because residents and businesses 
responded so well to the city's pleas for conservation, the water supply is 
near normal, and the council has decided there is no need to enact the law now. 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean, however, that the community should go back to its 
water-wasting ways. Water conservation is a good habit to get into, not only 
when there is a drought but also as an everyday practice. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente's proposed ordinance regulating developers, businesses and 
commercial users has emergency mandatory conservation cutbacks set at specific 
water level stages with fines imposed for violations. That would help control 
non-residential use. 
</P>
<P>
There is one simple way homeowners can easily conserve large amounts of water 
without inconvenience: Follow the advice of experts on lawn care. Lawns and 
landscaping account for about half of all residential water use, and most 
people use about twice as much water as their lawns need. 
</P>
<P>
Conservation makes sense. It saves residents money. But, most important, it 
saves scarce water that should be used wisely and sparingly, no matter how high 
the reservoir might be today.

INVESTIGATIONS INTO THREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to comment on the article by David Reyes (March 25) about the 
extortion threats being investigated by the FBI, and the Westminster and Garden 
Grove police. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that the reporter as well as the FBI and the police have 
problems distinguishing between a criminal act and a patriotic call for human 
rights and freedom in Vietnam. I am a supporter of many organizations fighting 
to liberate Vietnam from the Soviet-supported Viet Cong regime. But I have 
never seen or heard anyone from these organizations talking or even mentioning 
extorting money from individuals or merchants in Vietnamese business 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, they talked about ways to collect donations from anyone who supports the 
cause. But to associate these fund-raising techniques with criminal acts is 
just like accusing the Republican or Democratic parties of extorting money from 
the people during election campaigns when telephone calls to potential voters 
were made by candidates' supporters asking for support or financial 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
I totally support the police in their attempts to stop crimes committed by 
Vietnamese gangs against their compatriots, and I call upon all Vietnamese to 
give the police information that can lead to the arrests of these criminals. 
But for the FBI and local police to start an investigation based on unfounded, 
half-truth and half-lie rumors is a waste of taxpayers' money and time when 
real efforts should be spending on encouraging the victims to stand up and 
fight back.

QUAYLE'S VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to your Aug. 25 article on Dan Quayle's Orange County visit, I have a 
much clearer understanding of what it takes to become vice president. 
</P>

THE STATE OF HUD AND ITS PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mess at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development seems to be a 
never-ending story. The public image of all HUD programs is one of a giant 
fiasco. HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has even referred to some of the programs as a 
"swamp." Organizations that have used HUD funds prudently and wisely are now 
becoming suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Housing Services of La Habra Inc. is a private, nonprofit 
corporation that has been the recipient of HUD Funds through the Community 
Development Block Grant program since 1977. This public/private partnership, 
governed by a board of neighborhood residents, city officials and local 
business leaders, has received some $920,000 in CDBG housing funds. The funds 
have been used to assist hundreds of low-income families through loans to 
repair and improve their homes. 
</P>
<P>
These funds have been used prudently. They have been used wisely. They have 
been loaned and repaid and loaned again. More than $3 million in home 
improvement has been funded from the original $920,000 and assets in the fund 
now totals $1.17 million. 
</P>
<P>
Drain the swamp, but preserve and encourage those programs that are on high 
ground. Much work remains to be done if we are to decently house American 
families.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the director of a social service agency that has worked closely and 
successfully with the Orange County Housing and Community Development 
Department for 15 years, I am surprised and troubled by your article on HUD in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Children &amp; Parents Together, Inc. provides survival services for 245 
deprived children and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the Board of Supervisors, Bob Pusavat and the HCD staff, OCPT has 
buildings in which to house its programs, a brand new Child Care Center and 
funds for critical needs that include: a new roof for one of the Head Start 
structures; a handicap ramp for special needs children; and a myriad of other 
essentials for providing a safe and sanitary environment for young children. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, the Orange County HCD staff provided professional assistance 
and monitoring of the actual projects. They also audited our books for 
expenditures related to HUD and made sure we had the necessary documentation. 
</P>
<P>
During my 15 years as director of OCPT I have seen the El Modena community 
transformed by HUD projects that provided: curbs and gutters, street lights, 
resurfacing of badly rutted streets, sidewalks put in for safe passage and 
renovated housing. I participate in the HCD community meetings where El Modena 
residents are able to communicate their needs to the HCD staff, the most recent 
of which resulted in low-cost housing projects for families and seniors. 
</P>
<P>
For a truer picture of the Orange County Housing and Community Development 
Department, perhaps you should interview those of us who have long benefited 
from Orange County HCD projects.

THE COUNTY'S INDIGENTS AND HEALTH-CARE COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your excellent editorials "Rich and Poor Alike Deserve Health Care" (Aug. 6), 
and "A Penny-Wise Legacy" (Aug. 8), are the latest of many recent articles and 
editorials on the health-care crisis in California and Orange County. The Aug. 
6 editorial ends on the note that recent reports "provide disturbing 
documentation that when it comes to the health of the less affluent, there is 
far too little curing -- or caring." 
</P>
<P>
I don't think the last point is true. Poll after poll reports that over 80% of 
Americans and Californians believe everyone should have access to basic health 
care regardless of ability to pay. The same view was expressed by over 80% of 
about 7,000 Orange County residents in public discussions sponsored by 
California Health Decisions, a nonprofit organization concerned with the ethics 
and economics of health-care issues. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is persuading our governor, state legislators and county 
supervisors to give the funding of health-care needs the high priority it 
deserves. 
</P>
<P>
The "obstetrical-diversion" policy at UCI Medical Center has been highly 
publicized. An equally severe and worsening problem is the shortage of prenatal 
care facilities for low-income and indigent women. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1988, in Orange County clinics, 766 pregnant women 
eligible for care were "referred elsewhere" because clinic capacity was not 
available. Whether they received services elsewhere is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1989, 1,287, more than half of those eligible, were 
referred elsewhere. The 68% increase in the number of women turned away comes 
at a time when "infant mortality can be linked to a variety of factors (and) 
lack of prenatal care was the most common," according to doctors at a medical 
symposium in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
If Gov. Deukmejian cuts two-thirds of state funding for family planning, more 
pregnancies will occur and the need for prenatal care will increase. 
</P>
<P>
Skimping on prenatal care costs taxpayers a lot. For every dollar spent on 
prenatal care, two to three dollars are saved on health problems of low 
birth-weight babies or babies born with birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
When the 1989-90 Orange County budget was approved on Aug. 1, Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder proposed developing a prenatal health task force, which 
would focus continuing attention on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
However, Orange County must go a step further and provide funding for prenatal 
care to 1,500 additional women who will otherwise not have access to needed 
services in the coming year. With county funding, the services can be provided 
by community clinics throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County residents need to let the supervisors know they do indeed care, 
and urge them to provide the necessary funding for adequate prenatal care.

PSYCHICS AID HUNT FOR ALZHEIMER VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Benjamin Jackson Lee Franklin's daughters have distributed 1,500 flyers, 
organized neighborhood search parties and even consulted two psychics. But one 
month after he walked away from his Chatsworth home, the 81-year-old war hero 
is still missing. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, who was awarded a Bronze Star in World War II and now suffers from 
Alzheimer's disease, left his house in the 9900 block of Rudnick Avenue on Aug. 
2. He was seen at an ice cream store at Mason Avenue and Devonshire Street in 
Chatsworth and later sitting on a nearby bus bench. 
</P>
<P>
But his daughter, Patricia Gillies of Tujunga, said she doubts that any bus 
picked her father up. "In his condition, he'd never attempt to get on an RTD," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Franklin has lost the ability to speak clearly, dial a 
telephone or remember an address. "All he does is chuckle and laugh or break 
down and cry," Gillies said. "He's become very emotional." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Ill 
</P>
<P>
Gillies and Franklin's other daughters -- Marlene Coast and Barbara Russell, 
both of Granada Hills -- said the strain of worrying about their missing father 
has made their mother, Vivian, 77, ill. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters said they have done everything they can. Search parties have been 
organized and flyers have been distributed from the San Francisco Bay Area to 
the Mexican border. They have called the Los Angeles Police Department's 
missing persons section so often that they have been asked to limit their 
inquiries to one a day. 
</P>
<P>
Then they went to the psychics. The first one said she couldn't communicate 
with Franklin because "his mind was too confused," Gillies said. The second 
psychic, Sonia, said Franklin "was traveling up the coast in a truck with 
another man," according to Russell. The sisters will visit Sonia at her Beverly 
Hills salon again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There has been one unconfirmed sighting. On Aug. 17, a McDonald's employee in 
Castaic called the Sheriff's Department and said a man who looked like Franklin 
had just bought a hamburger. Deputies arrived after the man had left, Gillies 
said, but were unable to locate him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shopping Cart 
</P>
<P>
Coast received a call a week later about a man who looked like her father who 
was pushing a shopping cart in Chatsworth. The man was there when she arrived, 
but it wasn't her father. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew my father wouldn't be pushing a shopping cart, but I couldn't be sure," 
Coast said. "I hate to think that my father would look like a street person, 
but he's been away for so long, that's how he'd look unless somebody is taking 
care of him." 
</P>
<P>
Police officers investigating Franklin's disappearance were unavailable for 
comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Russell's frustration is turning into anger. She said she believes that her 
father has been abandoned. Franklin, a 27-year Navy veteran, was awarded the 
Bronze Star for carrying wounded soldiers to safety while under artillery fire 
during the Normandy invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"We've exhausted every channel," Gillies said. "Our only hope is the public. 
Maybe somebody will see his picture and tell us where he is."

TOMBSTONES CONTINUE TO TURN UP;

DELIVERIES TO CEMETERIES COME FROM DEFUNCT BUSINESS

The Mystery of the Missing Tomb Markers deepened Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Four grave markers from Valley Memorials Lodge Monument Co. of Encino, which 
went out of business without warning 12 days ago, have turned up at a 
Chatsworth cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
And a North Hollywood woman who purchased a marker from the company said 
Saturday that it had appeared at a cemetery near her home. 
</P>
<P>
The appearances cast more darkness than light on the circumstances surrounding 
the closure of Valley Memorials. 
</P>
<P>
Bewildered, grieving customers began showing up at the company's offices last 
week, looking for tomb markers that they had purchased. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen markers were dropped off 12 days ago at Mt. Sinai Mortuary in 
Hollywood. Officials said they were left without the proper papers, 
authorizations or fees to cover placement of the stones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4 Dropped Off 
</P>
<P>
Norman Ruppert of Oakwood Memorial Park in Chatsworth said Saturday that four 
markers were dropped off there a week ago, with a check signed by David Lodge, 
who identified himself as president of Valley Memorials. 
</P>
<P>
Ruppert said he had contacted two families who apparently paid for the markers 
to be placed in that cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Butler of Burbank said she had spoken to a David Lodge on the phone a few 
days ago and had pleaded with him to bring her deceased husband's marker to 
Valhalla Memorial Park. "I didn't know where it was, but I just cried and cried 
to him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The grave marker showed up the following day at Valhalla, she said. "I'm glad 
it showed up, but it was a hard week dealing with that." 
</P>
<P>
She said her husband died in March, and she paid $500 for the marker and 
placement fees. 
</P>
<P>
She said she still may have to pay the cemetery for the marker's placement. 
Attempts to reach Lodge on Saturday were unsuccessful.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 100 ACRES SCORCHED BY FIRE IN NEWHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fast-moving fire in Newhall scorched about 100 acres of grass and brush 
before it was contained Saturday evening, Los Angeles County fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out just west of San Fernando Road and Sierra Highway 
about 4 p.m., destroyed an outbuilding and damaged a motor home and a flatbed 
truck in an oil field, a Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, attacked by about 230 firefighters, 25 engines, two bulldozers and 
two helicopters, was surrounded about 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who predicted that the blaze would be extinguished by morning, 
said the cause had not been determined.

RAIDERS FINALLY GET GOING BUT CAN'T STOP BEARS IN 41-38 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you thought it couldn't get any silver and blacker, a Raider pulse 
was detected. Of course, it ebbed away in time to allow another fourth-quarter 
game-winning rally, and -- voila! -- they had their first winless exhibition 
season ever. 
</P>
<P>
They spotted the Chicago Bears a 20-0 lead . . . zoomed from behind to lead 
twice in the fourth quarter . . . and coughed up both. They fell finally, 
41-38, Saturday on Jim Harbaugh's touchdown pass to Wendell Davis with 1:53 
left before their now-customary little throng of 32,652 at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
There were a lot of things that Coach Mike Shanahan could have said, including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- His offense had just come back to life. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His quarterback, Jay Schroeder, had just rallied from an early interception 
and booing to salvage his starting job. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Shanahan's defense had just surrendered 508 yards. 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't just the scrubs. In the last two first halves, the No. 1 Raider 
defense surrendered 477 yards to the Houston Oilers and the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Surprise! Shanahan left the silver linings unappreciated until he dealt with a 
more pressing problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Up front, we were dominated," he said without waiting to be asked, staring 
stonily ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"They controlled the line of scrimmage, ran the ball at will. We're going to 
have to make huge strides if we want to contend for that AFC West." 
</P>
<P>
Even this was an understatement. Even conceding the fact that they played most 
of the exhibition season without Howie Long and Jerry Robinson and Saturday 
without Scott Davis, and hope to have all back for the opener, they gave up a 
fat average of 176 rushing yards per exhibition. They have a new defensive 
coordinator, Dave Adolph, who has installed a new scheme, and so far, it 
doesn't look as if they have it down. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday started out in the image of last week's one-sided first half, in which 
the Oilers outgained the Raiders, 203-9. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears won the coin toss, received . . . and marched 85 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder threw an interception. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears marched another 85 yards to another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders went three-plays-and-out. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Gossett penned the Bears up at their own six-yard-line with a booming 
53-yard punt . . . whereupon the Bears marched 94 yards for their third 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After three Chicago possessions, it was 20-0, Mike Tomczak was 11 for 14, and 
the Raiders had been outgained in yardage, 264-32. In their last two first 
halves, they had now been outgained, 467-41. It was hard to tell if this was a 
job for Al Davis or the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
And then the Raider turned. 
</P>
<P>
On the second play of the ensuing possession, Willie Gault lost rookie 
cornerback Donnell Woolford, got behind him by a good five yards, caught 
Schroeder's bomb and loped on in to complete a 78-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder threw a 38-yard pass to Mike Alexander to the Bear one on the next 
possession, then a four-yard touchdown pass to the new tight end, Mike Dyal. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder quarterbacked two more touchdown drives in the third period -- of 64 
yards and 66 yards -- and the Raiders were actually ahead, 28-27. In the first 
three exhibitions, Schroeder and the first unit put up one touchdown, but 
Saturday they rang up four. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan said later that Schroeder was "a little shaken" after the early 
interception. Remember, Schroeder came into this game at 43.4%, with mounting 
sentiment around for a switch to Steve Beuerlein. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I was pressing things," Schroeder said. "I was trying to make a big 
play, trying to get things going. I lost the safety (Shaun Gayle, who 
intercepted). I thought he'd gone straight back and I had more room to work 
with." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd booed. 
</P>
<P>
Did Schroeder see the future containing a clipboard and visor? 
</P>
<P>
"You can't worry about that," he said. "I've been booed a lot of times. I got 
booed clear out of there (Washington's R.F. Kennedy Stadium). Then the next 
week, you come back, you make a play or two and it's, HEY!!! I've been booed 
and I've been cheered. It just goes up and down." 
</P>
<P>
So did the rest of this game. 
</P>
<P>
Harbaugh threw a 59-yard touchdown pass to rookie Tom Waddle, who got away from 
ex-Bear Mike Richardson. Bears, 34-28. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' Jeff Jaeger kicked a 30-yard field goal. Bears, 34-31. 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein combined on a 57-yard scoring play with none other than Mervyn 
Fernandez, back after only a two-week absence with a shoulder separation. 
Fernandez caught the ball at the Bear 38, cut across the field and ran away 
from the Chicago secondary. Raiders, 38-34. 
</P>
<P>
Harbaugh took over with 5:20 left and drove the Bears 80 yards to victory, 
finishing it with a 23-yard scoring pass to Davis -- his third touchdown catch 
of the day -- and the Bears had the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
From a Raider standpoint, the exhibition season was ending just when they 
looked as if they could stand to be starting one. 
</P>
<P>
However . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're where we want to be," Schroeder said. "But we've got to 
kick it up anextra notch from where we are today. 
</P>
<P>
"Next week is for real. Next week, we can't just say, 'Hey, we'll get 'em next 
week.' 
</P>
<P>
"Next week, we gotta get 'em. Some way, somehow, we gotta get 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
The unkindest cut of all: Cornerback Mike Haynes, the 36-year-old walking 
legend who was already in a fight for his career, was beaten on Jim Harbaugh's 
32-yard touchdown pass to Wendell Davis. Of the top four Raider corners, only 
Lionel Washington had a good day, but it's Washington who has Haynes' job. The 
cutdown to 47 is today. . . . Jackie Shipp broke a bone in his right hand. Matt 
Millen came in for him and played spiritedly. When he made a tackle on his 
first play, he hopped up and gave Bear Coach Mike Ditka a fist-in-the-air 
salute. Ditka, laughing, returned it. Tune in today to see if it was Millen's 
last stand as a Raider.

Witt, apparently oblivious to the game-winning home run he had just allowed, 
holding up his glove and calling for another ball from plate umpire Al Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 C'mon, let's try it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen games into this 15-game gantlet through Kansas City, Texas, Boston 
and New York, the Angels only wish they could do just that. Since leaving home, 
they are 4-9 -- their latest defeat coming Saturday night on Mel Hall's home 
run in the bottom of the ninth inning, giving the New York Yankees a 2-1 
victory before 23,508 fans at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Almost worse still, the Angels were nearly dealt a cruel bookend for the 
demoralizing injury sustained by pitcher Chuck Finley on the first game of the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth inning Saturday, Angel cleanup hitter Wally Joyner left the field 
on a stretcher after tripping over pitcher Greg Cadaret's right leg and landing 
in a heap on a close play at first base. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays of Joyner's left knee eventually proved negative -- the injury was 
diagnosed as a deep bruise -- but Joyner left the stadium wearing a padded leg 
splint, possibly not to return to the Angel lineup until the Angels return home 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, Angel Manager Doug Rader looked at this grueling portion of his 
team's schedule -- by four games, the Angels' longest trip of the season -- and 
jokingly referred to it as "the Bataan death march." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Rader was asked for a re-assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Has it turned out to be even worse than he'd anticipated? 
</P>
<P>
"No, not really," Rader said, managing a thin smile. "Any time you're on a road 
trip of this length, it's going to take its toll, no question. 
</P>
<P>
"The first day in Kansas City was the worst, when Chuck went down. That was a 
very, very big loss for us. And right before that, there was Schoey (shortstop 
Dick Schofield, who broke his hand during the club's last homestand). 
</P>
<P>
"You try to minimize the loss for the benefit of everybody, in deference to the 
people who have to replace them. You don't want to make it out to be an 
earth-shattering event. But the truth of the matter is, those two people are 
sorely missed." 
</P>
<P>
For an hour or so, the Angels feared that Joyner would make it a threesome. 
It's seldom a positive sign when your starting first baseman hits into a double 
play . . . and has to return to the dugout on a canvas stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
Two sets of X-rays were taken before a fracture was ruled out. The final 
diagnosis turned out to be a "contusion" of the knee, and by the time he limped 
out of the clubhouse for the team bus, Joyner was talking hopefully of playing 
again as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me some pain pills, but if I took them, I couldn't play (today)," 
Joyner said. "I'm hoping (the pain) will go away by then." 
</P>
<P>
A more realistic scenario, according to Rader, would have Joyner sitting out 
these last two games in New York and having the knee re-examined Tuesday in 
Anaheim by Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Angels' team physician. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Angels, 3 1/2 games behind Oakland in the American League West, will 
try to snap a three-game losing streak without Finley, without Schofield and, 
most likely, without Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when it's going to hit everybody," Witt said. "I'm sure tomorrow 
they'll look around and see the starting lineup and wonder, 'What's going on?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Not even the supposedly shattered Yankees have helped ease the Angels' dilemma. 
The Angels are 0-2 here, getting no pitching in Friday night's 11-5 defeat and 
then no hitting Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' only run against Cadaret (5-4) was a sixth-inning home run by Brian 
Downing. But because Witt (8-12) countered with his best outing in seven weeks, 
that run was enough to keep the Angels tied through eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Witt took a five-hitter into the bottom of the ninth, New York's lone run 
coming on a walk and a pair of infield singles in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
But on the first pitch of the ninth, the Yankees' Hall untied everything, 
sending a fastball into the right-field bleachers for his 12th home run of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
That scene that followed bordered on the surreal, with Hall joyously rounding 
the bases while Witt stood resolutely on the mound, calling for another ball so 
he could make another pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The game was over, but Witt wasn't acknowledging it, as if refusing to accept 
the hard reality of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
In actuality, Witt was more in a haze than dazed, so locked into his work that 
he said he forgot where he was. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know the game was over until the umpire told me to get off the 
field," Witt said. "I knew it was the ninth and I knew the score was tied. But 
for some reason, I was still thinking we had the last at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I thought we were playing at home." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it has been a long trip. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels were tied for first place when it began, way back on Aug. 21. Now 
they're alone in third and slipping, losing not only to streaking teams (Kansas 
City and Boston), but also to slumping ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks is a long time to be on the road," said pitcher Bert Blyleven, again 
entrusted with the task of breaking an Angel losing streak today. "But it's no 
excuse for playing bad." 
</P>
<P>
For that, the Angels can only blame what they see in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel hearts might have skipped a beat or two at the sight of Wally Joyner 
being carried off the field on a stretcher, but according to Angel trainer Rick 
Smith, such an exit is standard operating procedure. "Obviously, he was not 
going to come off on his own power," Smith said. "With a knee injury, the most 
conservative, and best, method was by stretcher." Joyner hurt the knee when he 
landed hard on the ground after tripping over the left leg of Yankee pitcher 
Greg Cadaret, covering first base to complete an eighth-inning double play. "It 
looked like he didn't know where the base was, because he started backing up," 
Joyner said. "If I would've jumped over the base, I'd have missed him. Maybe 
that's what I should've done, huh?" Joyner said he "jammed" his knee into the 
ground when he landed. "I didn't think there was any damage," he said. "My knee 
was barking, but that was about it." 
</P>
<P>
Angel shortstop Kent Anderson had an exasperating fifth inning afield, with his 
misadventures on three consecutive ground balls leading to New York's first 
run. First, the Angels failed to turn a double play when Roberto Kelly's 
grounder to Anderson took a big second hop and the only out he could get was on 
lead runner Bob Geren at second base. Then, when Kelly breaking for second with 
Randy Velarde at bat, Anderson shaded toward the bag -- and Velarde poked a 
single through the hole Anderson just vacated. Finally, with Kelly on third 
base, Anderson gloved a grounder by Steve Sax over second base but his running 
throw to first base was late, enabling Kelly to score the run. "That was 
unfortunate," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "When he gave Johnny (Ray) the 
ball (on Kelly's grounder), he was out of position to make the pivot. Then Sax 
beats a ball up the middle and beats it out. Unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Deion Sanders, among the minor-league recalls to join the Yankees Saturday, 
made an appearance in the eighth inning after Kelly was ejected for arguing a 
strikeout call by home plate umpire Al Clark. Sanders hit .278 with five home 
runs, 30 runs batted in and 16 stolen bases in 70 games at triple-A Columbus. 
Accompanying him to New York was Columbus catcher Brian Dorsett, who played 
briefly with the Angels in 1988. Dorsett, traded to New York for minor-league 
pitcher Eric Schmidt last November, shared the team home run leadership at 
Columbus with 17. He also hit .250 and drove in 62 runs in 110 games.

SMU RETURNS AND IS ROUTED BY RICE; 
</P>
<P>
IN MUSTANGS' FIRST GAME SINCE NOV. 22, 1986, OWLS GET A RARE VICTORY, 35-6

<P>
In front of 23,227 witnesses Saturday night in Ownby Stadium, SMU football rose 
from the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters flew in from across the country to describe it. 
</P>
<P>
Bands played. 
</P>
<P>
Fans rejoiced. 
</P>
<P>
It was not, however, as joyous a moment as it might have been. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly a collection of exuberant freshmen -- only seven of the 89 players who 
suited up for the Mustangs had any previous college football experience -- SMU 
was overwhelmed and overpowered by Rice, which takes some doing. 
</P>
<P>
An eased-up 35-6 victory by the Owls was their first win in almost two years 
and ended an 18-game losing streak. Rice, which hasn't had a winning season 
since 1963, had not beaten a Division I-A opponent since Nov. 29, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It had been even longer since SMU had fielded a team. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the matchup generated tremendous interest. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd in the renovated stadium, which saluted the Mustangs with a standing 
ovation as they took the field, fell just short of a sellout, and SMU officials 
issued more than 250 media credentials. 
</P>
<P>
The curious had flocked to Texas for the resurrection of a football program 
that had been deemed so corrupt it was shut down in February 1987, when the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. announced that it had uncovered major rules 
violations for the second time in five years. The Mustangs were stripped of 
their 1987 schedule and, limited to a seven-game all-road schedule in 1988, 
elected to sit out last year, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs hadn't played a game since Nov. 22, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Between that date and Saturday night's coming-out party, SMU made several 
changes in the way it conducts its football business. 
</P>
<P>
University President A. Kenneth Pye was brought in from Duke and made it known 
that, in the future, SMU would strive to align itself more closely with the Ivy 
League, or something close to it, than with the Southwestern Conference. All 
but two of the latter's nine schools have had their football programs 
sanctioned by the NCAA in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
No longer does SMU accept athletes that do not meet the school's general 
admission standards, including a minimum score of 900 on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test, which is 200 points higher than the NCAA standard. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, no longer will it pay its players, a practice that was revealed 
by the NCAA in its investigation of the program, circa 1986. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's the idea. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to further de-emphasize the importance of the football program, 
the Mustangs have forsaken 65,024-seat Texas Stadium, home of the Dallas 
Cowboys, to play their home games in an on-campus facility that accommodates 
only 23,733 fans and hadn't been used for SMU games since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Not that those who play in it will notice any difference. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Forrest Gregg inherited a program short on scholarships and almost 
completely devoid of upperclassmen. His starting lineup against Rice included 
15 freshmen, two sophomores and three seniors. Of the 89 players on the roster, 
only 41 are on scholarship and just 16 are not freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Glieber, a senior wide receiver who caught three passes against Rice, 
is the only scholarship player remaining from the 1986 team. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, 0-11 last season, walked into this golden opportunity as a 16-point 
favorite, which said a lot about the state of the SMU program. 
</P>
<P>
Rice hadn't been favored against an opponent since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg's young players, though, couldn't have cared less. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them were big-eyed out there," Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? 
</P>
<P>
Most of them had never experienced anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was well worth the wait," said Glieber, who caught only two passes in the 
1986 season. 
</P>
<P>
Gathered last year, when 18 scholarship players and 42 walk-ons practiced in 
the Dallas heat four days a week and scrimmaged on Fridays, Gregg's team had 
met daily under a sign that read: "SMU vs. Rice, Sept. 2, 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Were they excited? 
</P>
<P>
Matt Lomenick, a junior from Miami, fairly leaped out of his uniform after 
kicking a 23-yard field goal to give the Mustangs a 3-0 lead less than three 
minutes into the game. SMU's Cary Brabham had recovered the opening kickoff at 
the 16-yard line after Trevor Cobb of Rice had fumbled it away. 
</P>
<P>
But that was about the extent of the Mustang highlights. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Hollas of Rice, a converted free safety, looked as if he should have been 
a quarterback all along, completing 16 of 32 passes for 222 yards and two 
touchdowns, and running for 82 yards and two more touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Rice piled up 506 total yards, averaging more than six yards a play, and 
limited SMU runners to 32 yards in 31 carries. 
</P>
<P>
SMU hadn't scored so few points against Rice since 1964, when it was beaten, 
7-6, and hadn't lost to the Owls since 1976.

HE'S HAPPY WITH WHAT HE LEFT IN BALTIMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

CLEVELAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been almost two years since Edward Bennett Williams, the late owner of 
the Baltimore Orioles, swept out his front office. 
</P>
<P>
For most of those two years, Hank Peters, the chief victim of Williams' purge, 
has been trying to turn the Cleveland Indians into a pennant contender. 
</P>
<P>
But Peters can't help wondering a little what might have been had he remained 
the chief operating officer of the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many years there we had to win today and say the heck with tomorrow," the 
Cleveland president reflected. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way the circumstances were with the owner. That's the way he wanted 
it and that's the way it was done. If he were still there, I think the policies 
would still be the same." 
</P>
<P>
As does everyone else in baseball, Peters salutes the achievements of the 
current Orioles and says, "They should be very proud of themselves. They have 
far exceeded everybody's expectations, including their own. It's great for the 
club, and the fans have been tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
But, even if the Orioles win the American League East, he seriously doubts the 
shock waves will continue in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to ask yourself, 'Can they repeat this next year?' And you have to 
say to yourself, 'No way,' " he said. "They're having one of those dream years. 
Unfortunately, the ability to keep it up is questionable." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the components of the surprising Orioles were collected by Peters and 
his farm director, Tom Giordano, who is in the Dominican Republic on a scouting 
trip and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Milacki. Pete Harnisch. Jeff Ballard. The Ripken brothers. Craig 
Worthington. Larry Sheets. All farm system products from the former regime. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take anything away from Roland (Hemond)," said Peters. "He has 
done an excellent job of making a lot of minor deals to get pieces, but 
directly or indirectly, almost every player they have is a result of what was 
already there," said Peters. "It's nice to know that maybe what we were doing 
wasn't all wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at Keith Moreland for Brian Dubois, Dave Johnson for Carl Nichols, 
Mark Williamson in the Terry Kennedy trade (for Storm Davis). All those guys 
that were traded were in the system. 
</P>
<P>
"The list goes on an on. Now, all of a sudden everybody wants these players we 
had." 
</P>
<P>
Williams wanted action. Peters wanted patience. The friction soon became 
unbearable for both and Peters said he "was relieved to be relieved" when he 
was dismissed the day after the 1987 season ended. 
</P>
<P>
"A huge element in all of this (the Orioles' big turnaround) is luck," said 
Peters. "We're not all that smart. Some guys in baseball border on journeymen 
and then all of a sudden, they break through. 
</P>
<P>
"Brad Komminsk is like that for us. He was rated the best prospect in the 
minors and never made it (with Atlanta). We sign him as a minor-league free 
agent and he's hitting over .290 and playing a great center field. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great amount of luck involved in moves. Sometimes, it smiles on you 
as it has the Orioles." 
</P>
<P>
The Indians' problems center on a too-long infertile farm system and, "'If you 
don't have a flow,' as Ed Williams would say, 'you're not going to be any 
good,"' said Peters. 
</P>
<P>
And, at the major-league level, the Indians have suffered from sub-par 
offensive years by several of their regulars, including Cory Snyder, Andy 
Allanson and Oddibe McDowell (before he was dealt to Atlanta). 
</P>
<P>
They are next-to-last in the league in batting average and battling feeble 
Detroit for last in runs scored. Respectable pitching and defense simply 
haven't been enough. 
</P>
<P>
Indians Manager Doc Edwards believes the secret of the Orioles' success lies in 
the outfielders' ability to chase down drives that used to fall for doubles and 
triples. 
</P>
<P>
"And everything they do (player moves) turns to gold," he said. "I said back in 
spring training they were going to be a hell of a lot better. The outfield 
speed is the big difference. Defensive RBIs are hard to come by and they get 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Indians pitching coach Mark Wiley left Baltimore about a month after the purge 
although he was invited back to Cal Ripken's staff. He worked with a number of 
the current Orioles pitchers in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
He agrees with Edwards that the defense "can make pitchers look terrible and 
they're running down everything now.

A'S STEWART NEARS THIRD CONSECUTIVE 20-VICTORY SEASON, 7-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been more than a decade since a pitcher has won 20 or more games for 
three consecutive seasons. Jim Palmer of the Baltimore Orioles did it in 
1976-78. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart (19-8) of the Oakland Athletics is about to accomplish the feat. 
The right-hander, who had a five-hitter at Milwaukee, should get five more 
starts. And with the Athletics starting to score runs, there's not much doubt 
he'll do it. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco each hit two-run home runs to help the Athletics 
win, 7-2, and open their lead in the West to 2 1/2 games over Kansas City and 3 
1/2 games over the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third victory in a row for Stewart, who began his career in 1978 
with the Dodgers, had only 39 victories going into the 1987 season, but needs 
only one more to reach 100. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who is 10-1 lifetime against the Brewers, struck out eight and walked 
one. In his last four games, covering 31 1/3 innings, Stewart has walked only 
three. After giving up two runs in the third inning, he retired the last 18 he 
faced. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, who missed the first half of the season because of a wrist injury, has 
had a big week. In the last five games Canseco is 12 for 22 and has driven in 
13 runs. He has hit five home runs in the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
In 41 games, he has 12 home runs and 37 runs batted in. His home run in this 
game was a 430-foot blast. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes it much easier to pitch when Mark and Jose start hitting home runs," 
Stewart said. "It takes some of the pressure off. I want to win 20, but I'd 
rather win another pennant." 
</P>
<P>
Texas 6, Kansas City 3 -- Nolan Ryan emerged from a mild slump to win his 288th 
game and struck out 11 in eight innings at Arlington, Tex. to improve to 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 42, gave up a two-run home run to Bo Jackson, his 28th of the season, to 
give the Royals a 2-1 lead in the first inning. He went eight innings, giving 
up eight hits to end his two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
With 254 strikeouts, Ryan easily leads the majors and already has 26 more 
strikeouts than he did last season with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has struck out 10 in 15 games this season, a Ranger career record. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals had won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a master," Royals Manager John Wathan said. "Whenever you go against him 
you know you're in for a fight. When you lose it's no fun, but you can't help 
but admire him." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who threw 146 pitches, said he didn't get into a groove until after three 
innings.

Toronto 4, Minnesota 2 -- When you're hot, you're hot. The Blue Jays had only 
four hits at Toronto against the Twins, but they won their fifth in a row to 
maintain their lead in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Whitt and Kelly Gruber each hit two-run home runs off Roy Smith (10-5) 
and that was enough to keep them a game ahead of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the season the Twins have scored runs in bunches when Smith is 
pitching. But this time three pitchers held them to seven hits. John Cerutti 
(10-8) earned the victory and Tom Henke pitched the last inning for his 15th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 2, Chicago 1 -- Gregg Olson tied the league record for saves by a 
rookie when he got the last four outs at Chicago for his 23rd save. 
</P>
<P>
Olson tied the record set by Doug Corbett of Minnesota in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, who had been outscored, 21-1, in losing their last two games, used 
five pitchers to hold the White Sox to a run. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Harnisch, who is 0-11 on the road, had a 2-0 lead in the sixth when he had 
to leave because of a bruised right forearm. Former Dodger Brian Holton pitched 
two scoreless innings to win it. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 6, Seattle 5 -- Dwight Evans went ahead of Joe DiMaggio on the all-time 
home run list when he hit a three-run home run at Boston to lead the Red Sox to 
their 11th victory in their last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
Evans has 362 home runs for 34th place on the home run list. With 16 this 
season, Evans, in his 17th season, needs four more to hit 20 or more for the 
ninth consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
Evans' home run gave the Red Sox a 6-2 lead and they barely hung on to remain 
five games out of first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 10, Cleveland 4 -- The Tigers have the worst record in the majors 
(49-89), but with their second victory in a row at Cleveland, they have just 
about eliminated the Indians from the race. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers had lost 12 in a row when they went into Cleveland. With Dion James 
going four for four, the Tigers dropped the Indians 10 1/2 games back in the 
East. DAN HAFNER

SOME OF GAME'S MOST DIFFICULT STAINS REMAIN -- ON ITS BIB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ross Newhan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose was rightfully suspended for acts that stained the game, to use the 
words of the late commissioner, Bart Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
What about New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who annually produces 
more stains than a baby with his first jar of strained carrots and often acts 
as if he were that age? 
</P>
<P>
Consider the mindless player moves that have destroyed a once-proud tradition. 
Consider the constant turnover in management, the musical chairs of the front 
office and manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the last two weeks, during which Steinbrenner: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fired Manager Dallas Green, then engaged him in a war of words. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tipped a reporter that he had five people on his hit list and immediately 
got rid of two by trading Ken Phelps and forcing General Manager Syd Thrift to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tipped another reporter that Dick Williams had called to say that he was 
available for any job Steinbrenner might want him for. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Did not rule out the possibility of Billy Martin returning for a sixth 
tenure as manager. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said he might have made a mistake in promoting Bucky Dent from his Columbus 
farm team to replace Green. 
</P>
<P>
Nice to see a little humility, at least. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have rushed Bucky," Steinbrenner said. "He's done a good job in 
difficult circumstances, but he might have come up too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he needs more experience. We probably should have brought him up here 
and let him coach for two years and get the experience he needs." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner added that Dent is "in the process of gaining that experience," 
but that "there isn't much of the season left for Bucky to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dent: "I disagree with that. I'm ready. I know how to manage. I may not be 
ready for losing is all. I don't like to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Some Yankees have said privately that Dent has already demonstrated that he 
feels the pressure inherent in managing for Steinbrenner, overworking an 
already beleaguered pitching staff by warming up relievers at the first sign of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
And Steinbrenner refuses to relieve the pressure and uncertainty, setting up 
the Dick Williams story only to knock it down -- slightly. 
</P>
<P>
"To conclude from my conversation with Dick that he is going to be my manager 
is ridiculous," Steinbrenner told Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened is that Dick called me on a friendship basis, knowing I'm going 
through a rough siege. He told me to hang in there, not to get down . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He did say that if I needed a baseball adviser, scouting done or somebody to 
look at minor league teams, 'I'm there, pal.' That was all there was to it. He 
never mentioned wanting to manage during the regular season again and neither 
did I." 
</P>
<P>
Asked then if he was eliminating the 60-year-old Williams, whom he sought to 
manage in 1974 and again in '81, he said, "I'm not making any guaranteed 
statements. I said Dallas Green would be my manager through the year and that 
didn't happen. I'm not going to be hung by my words." 
</P>
<P>
George II: Steinbrenner has accused the media of turning the Yankees' recent 
travails into a carnival, but no one can top the ringmaster himself. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the "George must go!" chants that have become routine at Yankee 
Stadium, Steinbrenner displayed his arrogant love of the spotlight by saying he 
wasn't angry, it was the fans' right. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way you get me mad in a situation like this is ignore me," he said. 
"They pay their money; they would probably boo the Pope." 
</P>
<P>
And appearing with Sam Donaldson on the ABC-TV show, "Primetime," Steinbrenner 
displayed consummate bad taste when it was suggested that the New York Mets, 
despite the Yankee tradition, havebecome the team New Yorkers love. 
</P>
<P>
"Loving in sports is winning," Steinbrenner said. "I could play a Hitler in 
right field if we were winning and the fans would cheer." 
</P>
<P>
Two acquaintances of Pete Rose expressed apprehension the other day regarding 
his possible reinstatement and general well-being. 
</P>
<P>
Said Joe Nuxhall, a former big league pitcher and longtime broadcaster for the 
Cincinnati Reds: 
</P>
<P>
"Pete is going to have to stay away from the track if he wants to be reinstated 
and I don't think he can do that. This has been the story of a man who thought 
he could rule the world and found out he couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dave Collins, the Cincinnati utilityman: 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a living nightmare for Pete. He has no other outlet. All 
his outlets are sports-related. I don't think he knows what he's in for. It's 
like cutting off your arms and legs." 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog found a new way to compliment and 
characterize first baseman Pete Guerrero, telling Rick Hummel of the St. Louis 
Post-Dispatch: 
</P>
<P>
"Pete's like Babe Ruth. I've never seen a hangover bother him. He's the best 
player with a hangover I've ever managed." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero had 91 runs batted in and a .419 average with runners in scoring 
position through Thursday, and Herzog added: "I've never had one like him. 
Maybe George Brett (with Kansas City) in 1977, but I don't see how he could 
have done any better than this guy." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Don Zimmer of the Chicago Cubs was one of the Brooklyn Dodgers' Boys of 
Summer, which has given birth to a T-shirt that is both selling well at Wrigley 
Field and being worn by Chicago players. It is inscribed: "The Boys of Zimmer." 
</P>
<P>
And the Cubs have shown some of that same Brooklyn magic, registering 27 
come-from-behind wins, 15 since July 20, 10 in their final at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Can they continue? Much depends on the pitching. Besides continuing problems 
with the fourth starting position: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Bielecki has not won since July 14 and has not gotten past the sixth 
inning in his last three starts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rick Sutcliffe has not gotten past the fourth in his last two starts and 
was booed at Wrigley Field when he left after 3 1/3 innings of Wednesday's loss 
to the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand why they booed," Sutcliffe said. "This is sickening. It's 
tough to face your teammates. I feel horrible. You can't eat or sleep when this 
happens. I've got to find some answers." 
</P>
<P>
If the Cubs' Jerome Walton and Dwight Smith finish 1-2 in the balloting for 
rookie of the year, it will be the fifth time that teammates have finished on 
top. The others: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1957, Ed Bouchee and Jack Sanford of the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1963, Gary Peters and Pete Ward of the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1975, Fred Lynn and Jim Rice of the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1984, Alvin Davis and Mark Langston of the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Gooden, reactivated from the New York Mets' disabled list Saturday after 
recovering from a shoulder strain, threw batting practice at Dodger Stadium 
Tuesday for the first time since July 1 and was disappointed that neither Frank 
Cashen, the club president, nor manager Davey Johnson was on hand to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"Davey hasn't seen me throw since I've been hurt and that's not right," Gooden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "I'm not going to go out there and watch him every time he 
throws. This is only one step he has to go through. I want to see the finished 
product." 
</P>
<P>
Met catcher Mackey Sasser left Los Angeles having started only four games in 
the last two weeks. Sasser went seven for 12 in those four starts and said: 
"I'm at least glad they're playing me on days I'm hot." 
</P>
<P>
Don Carman of the Phillies is 4-14 and unhappy that he has shuttled between the 
rotation and bullpen since May, when he was demoted after giving up 12 earned 
runs in 4 2/3 innings of consecutive starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 1-6 but I had a pretty good ERA (4.06)," Carman said with a straight 
face. "Then I had two bad games and you would have thought I was a bad pitcher 
or something." 
</P>
<P>
Or something? 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Witt seemed to be coming on during the second half of last season, making 
the same strides that a young fireballer named Nolan Ryan once had in his 
battle with wildness. 
</P>
<P>
Witt was 8-5 and pitched 12 complete games in his last 16 starts of 1988. But 
he is now 10-12, leads the American League in walks and earned runs allowed, 
and has seen his Texas Rangers lose six of his last seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Bobby Valentine, exasperated when Witt was unable to hold a 3-1 lead in 
Minnesota Thursday night, said it's time Witt learned to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
And when asked if a strong September was important for Witt, Valentine shook 
his head and said, "What for? So he can put together some numbers for his agent 
to take to arbitration?" 
</P>
<P>
If it's August, Bo Jackson's mind must be on football. The Kansas City Royals' 
outfielder batted .149 in August 1987, .218 in August 1988 and .210 in August 
this year.

Collusion II: If $10.5 million seemed a modest price for the owners to pay for 
their collusion during the winter of 1985-86, the damages seem certain to be 
higher for 1986-87. The players' association is asking for $60 million. The 
clubs acknowledge damages of $15 million to $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
Milestone: Nick Esasky drove in 36 runs in August, tying the Boston Red Sox 
record for that month set by Ted Williams in 1939 and equaled by Vern Stephens 
in 1949. If timing is everything, Esasky has it. He leads the American League 
in runs batted in and becomes a free agent at the end of the season. It is 
rumored that Esasky, a resident of Marietta, Ga., and a close friend of General 
Manager Bobby Cox of the Atlanta Braves, is headed home. 
</P>
<P>
1-2 Punch: Everyone talks about Kevin Mitchell and Will Clark, but how about 
Mitchell and Matt Williams, the San Francisco Giants' third baseman? Mitchell 
has 40 homers this year and Williams has 39, 26 at Phoenix and 13 with the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Power Shortage: Did the Oakland Athletics miss Jose Canseco this season? 
Consider that Canseco, in his 41 games, has 37 RBIs and 12 homers, projecting 
to 147 RBIs and 47 homers for a full season. 
</P>
<P>
Bad Timing: Ryne Sandberg, the Chicago Cubs' second baseman, has hit 26 homers, 
accounting for only 33 runs. He hit 19 of the 26 with the bases empty, the 
seven others with one on. 
</P>
<P>
Weird: The Chicago White Sox are vying for the team batting title in the 
American League, even though they have no one hitting .300. It also appears 
that their pitching staff will be without a 10-game winner for the first time 
since 1948, when the Sox won 51 games. ROSS NEWHAN

<P>
VIOLA LEARNS LESSON: IF YOU PITCH AROUND MITCHELL, WILLIAMS IS WAITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Viola, burned by Kevin Mitchell's three-run home run in New York last 
week, pitched around the major leagues' home run leader in the sixth inning 
Saturday at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have had trouble scoring runs for last season's American League Cy 
Young Award winner, and, trailing, 2-1, Viola had to be careful. 
</P>
<P>
The walk to Mitchell followed a one-out single by Will Clark and brought up 
third baseman Matt Williams. Apparently neither Viola nor the Mets were aware 
that since early August, Williams has hit more home runs than either Mitchell 
or Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Williams hit a 425-foot drive over the left-field fence to enable the Giants to 
continue their mastery over the Mets, 6-2. The Giants, 8-3 against the Mets 
this season, opened their lead in the West to five games. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, 3-5 on their final trip West, fell 3 1/2 games behind the Chicago 
Cubs in the East. They lost for the second time in 10 days to Rick Reuschel 
(16-6), who gave up four hits in eight innings for his best outing since 
hurting his shoulder nearly two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Viola, who is 2-4 since the Mets acquired him from Minnesota, wasn't going to 
let Mitchell beat him. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about the three-run home run he hit off me in New York," Viola said. 
"He has 41 home runs and 114 RBIs, so you take your chances with Williams. He 
has incredible power, but he's easier to pitch to." 
</P>
<P>
It has not been true lately. In his last 24 games Williams has hit 11 home runs 
and driven in 24 runs. During that span Mitchell has hit eight home runs and 
Clark five. Williams has 14 home runs in 59 games for the Giants; he had 26 
with Phoenix, giving him 40 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a changeup in the strike zone," Williams said. "I really haven't set 
any home run goals. I'm just trying to drive in runs and win some ballgames." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets activated Dwight Gooden, who has been on the disabled list since July 
2 because of a shoulder injury. The Mets say the right-hander will be used in 
late-inning relief, at least for his first two or three appearances. He is 
expected to be ready for his first starting assignment next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to do it next year," Gooden said. "But it sounds like a good 
idea for now, especially with the other starters doing well. I like the idea of 
coming in with the game on the line." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 10, Atlanta 3 -- After a brilliant start last season, Greg Maddux faded 
in the second half. This season Maddux has become the Cubs' best pitcher down 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux (16-10) pitched seven innings at Atlanta, giving up six hits and walking 
none. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs, in ending a two-game losing streak, stayed 2 1/2 games ahead of St. 
Louis. They scored six times in the first inning, with rookie Richard Wrona 
capping the burst with his first home run, a three-run smash. 
</P>
<P>
Three errors, two by shortstop Andres Thomas on one play, made all six runs off 
Marty Clary unearned. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 13, Houston 5 -- The Cardinals scored only 10 runs in their first 
four games on this homestand and in one game stranded 16 baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
They figured out a solution that is foreign to them. For the first time since 
the first week of last season, the Cardinals hit three home runs in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Pendleton, Tom Brunansky and John Morris hit home runs to lead a 15-hit 
attack that dropped the Astros five games behind San Francisco in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, who normally hit fewer home runs than any other team, have 62 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was beginning to wonder if we would hit more than Roger Maris did when he 
set the record (61)," Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog said. "It is much more fun 
watching a game in which we score 11 runs in the first four innings instead of 
the one when we couldn't score in 13 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Oquendo had three hits and drove in three runs for the Cardinals, who took 
over sole possession of second place in the East, 2 1/2 games behind the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 6, Pittsburgh 2 -- Tom Browning (15-10) pitched into the eighth 
inning at Pittsburgh to win his eighth in a row as the Reds won their third 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
During his streak Browning has an earned-run average of 1.75. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 3, Philadelphia 2 -- Ken Howell had a one-hitter and a 2-0 lead after 
seven innings at San Diego, but the Padres erupted in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts hit a two-run double to tie the score and Roberto Alomar singled 
home the winning run. Bruce Hurst (13-9) went eight innings to get the win. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Davis pitched the ninth to earn his 33rd save, most in the major leagues.

HARRIS, FORD LEAD WEST VIRGINIA OVER BALL STATE, 35-10

<P>
Major Harris passed to Reggie Rembert for two touchdowns on plays of 16 and 70 
yards, and tailback Garrett Ford rushed for 127 yards and two touchdowns in 16 
carries as 17th-ranked West Virginia defeated Ball State, 35-10, Saturday at 
Morgantown, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, a redshirt freshman who is the son of former Mountaineer and Denver 
Bronco running back Garrett Ford, became the first player in the school's 
history to rush for 100 yards in his first game. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who had several passes dropped, completed seven of 17 for 178 yards. He 
also rushed for 79 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Jones, Harris' backup, passed to freshman James Jett for a 38-yard 
touchdown play with just over four minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 38, Pacific 3 -- Curvin Richards, who rushed for 1,228 yards last 
season as a freshman, ran for 112 yards and a touchdown as the 20th-ranked 
Panthers rolled over the Tigers of the Big West Conference at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Van Pelt, the first freshman quarterback to start a season opener in the 
modern era of Pitt football, ran for one touchdown in the first half and later 
threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to fourth-string tailback Glenn Deveaux. 
</P>
<P>
Hosea Heard, who sat out last season for disciplinary reasons, scored on a 
55-yard reverse, and Henry Tuten added a 60-yard punt return for a score. 
</P>
<P>
The game marked the debut of Walt Harris as Pacific's coach. Next week, his 
team plays eighth-ranked Auburn. Pacific, outscored in its last three season 
openers, 133-17, hasn't had a winning season since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Rutgers 17, Cincinnati 17 -- The Bearcats, trailing, 17-3, scored twice in the 
fourth quarter to earn a tie with the Scarlet Knights at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hoog passed eight yards to fullback Doug Hoog for one of the Bearcats' 
touchdowns, and tailback Joe Abrams ran 34 yards for the other with 1:43 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown passes by Scott Erney of 11 yards to running back James Cann and four 
yards to running back Scott Blanche gave Rutgers its 17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams led the Bearcats in rushing with eight carries for 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Western Michigan 31, Temple 24 -- Michael Greene scored on a 73-yard run with 
5:27 left to give the Broncos a victory over the Owls at Kalamazoo, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Colgate 35, Fordham 3 -- Dave Goodwin completed 20 of 28 passes for 267 yards 
to lead the Red Raiders past the Rams at Hamilton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Colgate's Dan McCarthy caught seven passes for 132 yards and two touchdowns.

SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI HAS A SURPRISE PARTY AT FLORIDA STATE, 30-26

<P>
Southern Mississippi may have surprised Florida State Saturday, but the Golden 
Eagles didn't surprise Coach Curley Hallman. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a bunch of doers," Hallman said after Brett Favre's two-yard 
touchdown pass to Anthony Harris in the final minute gave Southern Mississippi 
a 30-26 victory over the sixth-ranked Seminoles. "We knew it before we came 
down here." 
</P>
<P>
Florida State took a 26-24 lead midway through the final quarter on Bill 
Mason's 27-yard field goal before Southern Mississippi put together a 6:34 
drive to set up Favre's winning pass with 23 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach told us, 'If you have them in the fourth quarter, you will win it,' 
" Favre said after completing 21 of 39 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns. 
"We knew they were scared." 
</P>
<P>
Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said he knew beforehand that Favre would be a 
handful for his young secondary. 
</P>
<P>
"He could make big plays and keep drives going," Bowden said. "Favre was good 
enough that he took advantage of mistakes we made." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Southern Mississippi could have won the game in a runaway, but the 
Golden Eagles made three turnovers inside the Florida State 15. 
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles took advantage of the first two Southern Mississippi turnovers to 
take a 10-0 lead on their first two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Golden Eagles came back, capitalizing on fumbles by Florida 
State's Shannon Baker and Dexter Carter to take a 17-10 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't knock them out when we had them down the first half," Bowden said. 
"We couldn't make the big plays." 
</P>
<P>
Southern Mississippi took its first lead with 11 seconds left in the first half 
when Favre lobbed a four-yard scoring pass to Alfred Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Ray Jackson's three-yard run tied the game, 10-10, early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles rebounded from the 17-10 halftime deficit with a pair of 
touchdowns in the third quarter to take a 23-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Dawsey caught a 23-yard scoring pass from Peter Tom Willis, and Dexter 
Carter added a nine-yard touchdown run. But a bad snap prevented Mason from 
making the extra point. Carter, who rushed for 118 yards, also scored the 
game's first touchdown on an 11-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Willis completed 25 of 40 passes for 269 yards for the Seminoles, who have lost 
their opener two straight seasons. Miami defeated Florida State, 31-0, a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles were 10-2 each of the last two seasons, losing both years to 
Miami.

SOUTH CAROLINA GIVES NEW COACH 27-21 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Harold Green ran for 160 yards and two touchdowns to lead South Carolina past 
Duke, 27-21, Saturday night at Columbia, S.C., and give Coach Sparky Woods his 
first Division I-A victory. 
</P>
<P>
Green, a 6-foot-2, 218-pound senior, scored on runs of 42 yards and one yard, 
most of which were through the middle of the Blue Devil defense, an area Coach 
Steve Spurrier hoped to shore up this season. 
</P>
<P>
Duke got most of its pointsd from star flanker Clarkston Hines, who scored his 
22nd and 23rd career touchdowns on receptions of four yards and one yard. 
</P>
<P>
The game was dedicated by the South Carolina players to the late Joe Morrison, 
Woods' predecessor who died of a heart attack in February. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina, 8-4 last season, scored two plays into its first possession on 
Green's tackle-breaking, 42-yard run through the middle of Duke's defense. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, 7-3-1 in 1988, scored on its next possession -- a 75-yard drive that 
ended with Hines' first touchdown. The extra-point kick went wide to the right. 
</P>
<P>
Gamecock kicker Collin Mackie then got the first of two first-half field goals, 
breaking by one Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers' 202-point career scoring 
record at South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina 10, Maryland 6 -- Anthony Barbour scored on a seven-yard run 
late in the third quarter, and the Wolfpack defense held off a fourth-quarter 
charge by the Terrapins for an Atlantic Coast Conference victory at Raleigh, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland quarterback Neil O'Donnell, who pulled off a last-second victory over 
North Carolina State last season, almost did it again, completing five of his 
first seven passes in the Terrapins' final drive. But after Maryland reached 
the N.C. State 17, the drive ended with two incompletions. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 30, Furman 0 -- The Paladins, defending Division I-AA champions, were 
no match for the 12th-ranked Tigers and were routed at Clemson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Furman had five turnovers, including three first-quarter fumbles. In the fourth 
quarter, a blocked punt went into the end zone, where Tony Mauney recovered for 
Clemson's final touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers gained more yards passing than running -- 166 yards to 155 yards -- 
for the first time in nearly two years as they handed the Paladins their first 
shutout in 76 games. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Tigers averaged 270 yards rushing and 114 yards passing a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Villanova 20, Richmond 17 -- Quarterback Kirk Schulz completed 27 of 43 passes 
for 317 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winner with 8:26 left, as 
the Wildcats rallied to beat the Spiders in a Yankee Conference opener at 
Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The winning throw went 22 yards to Robert Brady. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech 29, Akron 3 -- Quarterback Will Furrer passed for 211 yards and 
three touchdowns for Virginia Tech at Blacksburg, Va.

MISSISSIPPI STATE SNAPS LOSING STREAK IN BIG WAY, 42-7

<P>
They had to go back -- to 1916 -- in the football record books to match what 
happened Saturday night at Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
Ending a 10-game losing streak, Mississippi State used two-touchdown 
performances by Orlando Wade and Kenny Roberts to beat Vanderbilt, 42-7, in a 
Southeastern Conference opener at Starkville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest victory margin ever for Mississippi State in the 
Southeastern Conference, which was formed in 1933, and the largest over a team 
now in the SEC since 1916, when Mississippi State routed Mississippi, 36-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State Coach Rockey Felker said: "We wanted to get off to a good 
start and we did. This was a mighty big football win for us because it's that 
positive start we've talked about. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be close, nothing like this." 
</P>
<P>
The victory ended an 0-7 drought in the SEC over two seasons for Mississippi 
State and was only the Bulldogs' fourth win in the SEC in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was Vanderbilt's sixth straight, including the final five games of the 
1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
After building a 14-7 halftime lead, Mississippi State, a four-point favorite, 
scored on its first four possessions of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Wade ran for touchdowns of one and eight yards to cap third quarter drives, and 
Roberts, a redshirt freshman, raced 37 yards for a touchdown late in the third 
quarter and 87 for another early in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee 17, Colorado St. 14 -- In Earle Bruce's first game as the Colorado 
State coach, the Rams gave the Volunteers a scare before falling at Knoxville, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee scored the winning points on Greg Burke's 21-yard field goal with 
8:37 left for a 17-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State got close on Kevin Verdugo's two-yard touchdown run and a 
two-point conversion pass from Verdugo to Sean Willis. The touchdown came four 
plays after Bob Stratman recovered a fumble at the Tennessee 37. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the third quarter, Colorado State lined up with 12 men on the field on 
a Tennessee punt, allowing the Volunteers to keep possession. They scored seven 
plays later on an 11-yard run by Greg Amsler. 
</P>
<P>
The Volunteers scored first on a 21-yard run on a fake reverse by Reggie Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 20, Memphis St. 13 -- John Darnell passed for 255 yards and one 
touchdown as the Rebels won at Memphis, Tenn. Darnell's touchdown pass play to 
Willie Green covered 53 yards and gave Ole Miss a 17-3 lead.

NFL EXHIBITION ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
AIKMAN IS SHARP IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troy Aikman officially became the Dallas Cowboys' starting quarterback Saturday 
night, beating out Steve Walsh, and responded by completing 19 of 31 passes for 
306 yards to lead his team over the Houston Oilers, 30-28, in a final National 
Football League exhibition game at Irving, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Ruzek's 55-yard field goal on the last play of the game provided the 
winning points. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first appearance at Texas Stadium for Aikman, the first pick in last 
April's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
The game drew 63,582 fans, the Cowboy's largest exhibition crowd since 1981 and 
their largest crowd of any kind since Nov. 17, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys finished with an exhibition record of 3-1, and Houston wound up 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay 27, Cleveland 10 -- Vinny Testaverde passed for 229 yards and two 
touchdowns and clearly outplayed old college teammate Bernie Kosar as the 
Buccaneers (3-1) beat the Browns (1-4) at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde, beaten out for the University of Miami job by Kosar in 1983-84, 
completed scoring passes of 20 yards to Mark Carrier in the first quarter and 
33 yards to William Harris in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar bruised his left knee on the Browns' first play of the third quarter but 
remained in the game the rest of the period. He completed 14 of 22 passes for 
174 yards and one touchdown, a 13-yarder to Derek Tennell on Cleveland's first 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis 38, Denver 34 -- Jack Trudeau threw a five-yard touchdown pass to 
James Pruitt with 25 seconds left at Indianapolis to give the Colts their first 
unbeaten exhibition season in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos (2-2), who scored one touchdown after five consecutive penalties on 
Indianapolis (4-0) for disruptive crowd noise in the Hoosier Dome, took a 34-31 
lead on David Treadwell's 46-yard field goal with 3:18 left. 
</P>
<P>
Trudeau, subbing for starter Chris Chandler, drove the Colts 70 yards for the 
winning touchdown. The Colts lost all of their timeouts because of the 
penalties for crowd noise in the third quarter, so had to stop the clock with 
an incomplete pass on the play before Pruitt's touchdown catch. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler left the game because of bruised ribs in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 20, Miami 10 -- Jerome Brown and Seth Joyner returned 
interceptions for touchdowns less than five minutes apart in the third quarter 
as the Eagles (4-1) beat the winless Dolphins (0-4) at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 13, New York Giants 10 -- Gary Anderson kicked a 32-yard field goal 
with 1:44 left to give the Steelers (2-2) a victory over the Giants (2-2) at 
East Rutherford, N.J.

GEORGE ALLEN RETURNS TO TINY IOWA SCHOOL TO ASSIST TEAM IN ENDING ITS LOSING 
STREAK

<TEXT>
<P>
With the help of George Allen, formerly a National Football League coach, 
Morningside College snapped a 15-game losing streak with a 31-13 victory over 
Northwestern of Iowa Saturday night in the season opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, who coached the Rams and the Washington Redskins, coached at Morningside 
in 1948. Allen agreed to serve as a Morningside assistant for the past two 
weeks and was on the sidelines as the Division III school paid tribute to him 
during Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Johnnie Brown scored three times for Morningside. His one-yard run put the 
Chiefs ahead, 17-0, but Northwestern responded with a 28-yard scoring pass from 
Kirk Maasdam to Craig DeHaan. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside quarterback Mark Kamies then connected with Brown on scoring passes 
of 43 and 38 yards to put the game out of reach, as the Chiefs stopped the Red 
Raiders twice on fourth down inside the Morningside 10 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern got a late score on a six-yard run by John Swart.

BOXING NOTES;

<P>
CAYTON IS TAKING THE WRONG TACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALLACE MATTHEWS, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until somebody convinces me that Nevada and New Jersey will follow suit if New 
York finds cause to yank Don King's license, then the King-Bill Cayton-Mike 
Tyson hearing being conducted by the state athletic commission shapes up as 
nothing more than two rich guys fighting for control of a third rich guy. 
</P>
<P>
The issue, ostensibly, is Cayton asking New York to suspend or revoke King's 
promotional license for signing Tyson to a promotional contract without first 
consulting Cayton, Tyson's manager. 
</P>
<P>
But the real story is that Cayton is dumping his problem into the lap of 
commission chairman Randy Gordon when it belongs in a court of law. If Cayton 
thinks King has stolen his fighter, he should sue him. Instead, he is asking 
the commission to do his dirty work for him, and Gordon, constrained by the 
commission rules he was hired to enforce, must sit through this tiresome 
exercise in the pursuit of avarice knowing that no matter how he rules, it is 
unlikely to have much effect on the future business of King, the Teflon 
promoter with the teased Brillo hairdo. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey boxing commissioner Larry Hazzard already has said he would not in 
this case invoke the reciprocal agreement by most U.S. boxing commissions to 
honor each other's suspensions. "The only interest I have in reciprocal 
agreements are those that involve the health and safety of boxers," Hazzard 
said. "This thing is between King and Cayton, and we know what that's all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it's about greed, and which of them gets to skim and scam off Mike Tyson's 
purses. Dr. Elias Ghanem, the chairman of the Nevada commission, has gone on 
record as calling the New York hearings a "kangaroo court" and has asserted 
that "Don King has done wonders for Mike Tyson." 
</P>
<P>
Ghanem's scandalous closeness with King and Tyson has been well-documented in 
Newsday. He is the man whose clinic provides medical services to the Las Vegas 
Hilton while also ostensibly regulating that hotel's performance as one of 
Nevada's leading boxing promoters. He is the man who escorted King and Tyson 
across the court to their seats during a nationally televised UNLV basketball 
game, holding up the tipoff. He is the man who threw a private party at his 
home for Tyson, King and some selected high rollers. He is Tyson's personal 
physician, so he can work the same wonders he did when he was Elvis Presley's 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
But rule against King? Not Ghanem. 
</P>
<P>
As for New York, King has not promoted here since Dec. 12, 1986 -- the 
disastrous Madison Square Garden show on which Bonecrusher Smith knocked out 
Tim Witherspoon to win the World Boxing Association heavyweight title. And the 
only reason that fight ended up in New York is because King could not sell his 
trash anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
The only agency that might honor a King suspension is the New Jersey Casino 
Control Commission, which can deny a promoter a license to promote in a casino. 
If King is suspended by New York, the CCC might follow suit, effectively 
putting him out of business in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
But the bottom line is, who really cares who Mike Tyson's promoter or manager 
is? Randy Gordon ought to throw all of them out of his office and do his real 
job -- trying to bring boxing matches, not court fights, back into New York. 
</P>
<P>
Enough about money-grubbers. There is a group of New York boxing people who 
have given something back to the community, and now they need help. The South 
Queens Boys and Girls Club, an oasis in the wasteland of Atlantic Avenue, is 
badly in need of $1.5 million for repairs to the rapidly deteriorating 
building. On Sept. 25, a $200-a-plate benefit dinner will be held at the 
Sheraton Centre in Manhattan to raise some of the money. Wednesday, champions 
Mark Breland and Doug DeWitt and former champs Iran Barkley, Eddie Mustafa 
Muhammad and Vito Antuofermo, all of whom trained there at one time, showed up 
to lend support for the fund-raiser. All of them will be at the dinner, along 
with Joe Frazier, Roberto Duran, George Foreman, Jake LaMotta and Emile 
Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
The Ring, seemingly down for the 10-count a few months back, will climb off the 
deck one more time. The financially crippled "Bible of Boxing," started in 1922 
by Nat Fleischer, has been bought by G.C. London Publishing, which also puts 
out "KO" and "Boxing '89" as well as a bunch of wrestling rags. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to maintain the flavor of the old Ring," said KO 
editor-in-chief Stu Saks. KO senior writer Steve Farhood will be The Ring's 
editor, and Bob Cassidy Jr., son of the former light-heavyweight contender from 
Levittown, has been hired as a staff writer. So far, however, there are no 
plans to revive the Ring Record Book and Boxing Encyclopedia, an invaluable 
reference tool for promoters, managers, journalists and fans. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the way he felt Monday evening, Gordon is leaning toward not 
disqualifying himself from the King-Cayton hearing. He may, however, disqualify 
his loose lip. One of Rappin' Randy's comments in Monday's hearing caused 
King's lawyers to demand that he step down

CLAIRE MARINE SCORES WIRE-TO-WIRE WIN AT ARLINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Claire Marine, the Irish-bred filly who might have been a factor had she been 
entered in today's Arlington Million, settled for a wire-to-wire victory in the 
$500,000 Beverly D. Stakes at Arlington International Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Allowed to establish a slow early pace on a grass course listed as yielding, 
Claire Marine shrugged off a few challengers through the stretch to earn 
$300,000 for her owners, Chicagoan Sidney Port and Charlie Whittingham, who 
also trains the 4-year-old filly. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Marine, timed in 2:01 4/5 for the 1 3/16 miles, paid $4, $2.80 and $2.60 
as the favorite under Chris McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
Capades, 1 3/4 lengths back, paid $4.40 and $3.40 and Gaily Gaily returned 
$3.60. Next was Ravinella, followed by Key Flyer, Nastique, Here's Your Silver 
and Baba Cool. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Marine's win was her sixth in nine American starts, the other victories 
coming at Santa Anita, Hollywood Park and Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, she carried 123 pounds, the same as all the other starters except 
Capades and Key Flyer, who carried 117 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham considered starting Claire Marine in the Million, but already had 
Nasr el Arab and Frankly Perfect entered to run today. 
</P>
<P>
Port owns 75% of Claire Marine, who had one victory and four seconds from six 
starts in France before the Americans bought her a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I had mixed emotions about which race she would run in," said McCarron, winner 
of the 1984 Million with John Henry but without a mount in the race today. "In 
this race, I knew she had these mares over a barrel, but she would have been 
very tough Sunday, too." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens in the Million, Whittingham will return to California 
happy. Oczy Czarnie, the 3-year-old French filly who won Friday's Pucker Up 
Stakes, has been turned over to the trainer, and he also will take over River 
Warden after the 3-year-old French colt runs in the Million.

HOLIDAY INNS DANCED THE TAX-AVOIDANCE TWO-STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you sell something for a billion dollars more than it cost, you have to 
shell out big capital gains taxes to Uncle Sam, right? Wrong. Wrong, that is, 
if you're the guys running Holiday Inns. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday Corp., the Memphis-based hotel and casino company, is selling Holiday 
Inns to a British beer company for $2.225 billion -- about a billion dollars 
more than the Inns' value for tax purposes -- and plans to pay not a single 
penny of capital gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
How has the "nation's inn keeper" become the nation's tax avoider? Watch as 
Holiday dances its way through the tax code, saving itself a $350-million 
capital gains bill. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of getting a $2.225-billion check and turning Holiday Inns over to the 
buyer, a British brewing company called Bass PLC, Holiday is doing what the tax 
whizzes call a Morris Trust transaction, but which really is a Tax Avoidance 
Two-Step. (Morris Trust was the defendant in a lawsuit that the Internal 
Revenue Service brought and lost in an attempt to have this type of thing 
declared a taxable transaction.) 
</P>
<P>
How do you dance the two-step? Easy, provided you have good tax guidance, some 
first-rate paper shufflers and a buyer willing to issue stock rather than pay 
cash for the assets that you're selling. You simply do the planned sale in two 
separate transactions. 
</P>
<P>
In Step 1 of the Tax-Avoidance Two-Step, you take the assets that you want to 
keep, set up a new corporation to hold them, and give the shares in the new 
corporation to your current shareholders. That's a tax-free distribution, and 
no one owes any tax on it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details Are Everything 
</P>
<P>
In Step 2, you take what's left of your company -- which now owns only the 
assets that you want to sell -- and sell it in exchange for shares in the 
buyer's company. By getting shares rather than cash, you have a tax-free, 
stock-for-stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when the dust settles, you've unloaded the asset that you wanted to sell, 
and your stockholders still own the assets that you want to keep. The only 
difference between doing the deal this way and doing it the regular old boring 
way is that your stockholders hold two pieces of paper (the shares of the new 
company that you gave them, and shares of the acquirer) instead of one, and you 
didn't pay capital gains tax on the asset sale. 
</P>
<P>
In this type of deal, details are everything. 
</P>
<P>
Don't think for a minute that Holiday Corp. is the only corporation in the 
United States smart enough to squeeze through this loophole. Just last month, 
Tyler Corp. of Dallas finished a Tax Avoidance Two-Step that was so neatly done 
that almost no one but compulsive document readers, tax freaks and frustrated 
IRS auditors realized that the company had done a tax-free distribution and a 
stock-for-stock exchange rather than a sale of assets. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how it went. First, Tyler set up a new corporation called Tyler Two Inc. 
into which it put all its assets except for the Reliance Universal division, 
which makes coatings. Akzo N.V., a Dutch conglomerate, then bought the old 
Tyler -- in other words, Reliance Universal -- by forking over $105 million of 
Akzo stock and assuming the $165 million of debt on old Tyler's books. Value of 
the deal to Tyler shareholders: $270 million. Book value of the assets Akzo 
bought: $90 million. Capital gains tax saved: $65 million (my estimate; Tyler 
won't provide a number). 
</P>
<P>
And as soon as the sale to Akzo was completed, Tyler Two changed its name to -- 
guess what? -- Tyler Corp. So everything is as it was, except that Tyler has 
successfully done the two-step and avoided a big tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
Can Holiday Corp. and Tyler Corp. really save all this money just by doing a 
little extra paper shuffling? And can it possibly be legal? Yes and yes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Morris Trust-type of deal is the only way left to break up a company 
totally tax-free since the repeal of the General Utilities Doctrine," says 
Robert Willens, Shearson Lehman Hutton's resident tax genius in New York. The 
General Utilities Doctrine, which expired at the end of 1987, gave corporations 
a complicated way to indefinitely put off paying tax on sales of acquired 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
Willens, who came upon the Tyler deal about the time that a Texas arbitrager 
called up raving about how smart the Tyler people are, says Tyler pulled off "a 
classic Morris Trust deal, an absolute beauty." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Bloom, the national director of corporate tax for Peat Marwick Main, 
the big accounting firm, predicts that the Tyler -- and Holiday-type 
transactions could become more popular now that the 1986 tax reform act has 
wiped out the General Utilities Doctrine and other corporate tax dodges. "The 
ability to defer a gain on that gain (on an asset sale) is ever-present for 
anyone who is willing to do something different," Bloom says. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the high visibility of the Holiday deal -- it's not every day that 
an American institution is sold to a British beer company -- some spoilsport in 
Congress is probably going to figure out that the Morris Trust loophole is 
costing the Treasury big bucks. If nature then takes its course, someone in 
Washington will draw up tax legislation trying to overturn the Morris Trust 
decision. That will be good public policy, and will send legions of corporate 
tax types out looking for a new dodge. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tax Avoidance Two-Step goes on. And the shareholders of Holiday 
Corp. and Tyler Corp. ought to give their companies' tax planners a big fat 
bonus for being so imaginative and smart.

COFFEE IS THESE TASTERS' CUP OF TEA; 
</P>
<P>
PROFESSIONAL GRADERS DECIDE THE FATE OF IMPORTED BEANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a small corner room at the World Trade Center, an elite group of people with 
gifted taste buds, speedy slurps and an appreciation of caffeine gather for a 
special mission: to decide the fate of billions of beans. 
</P>
<P>
Equipped with cups, silver spittoons and freshly roasted brew that would shame 
any doughnut shop, the tasters judge whether coffee grown in 46 countries meets 
the standards of the New York Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
It's a job that has become more important because of the suspension of coffee 
export limits this summer, which resulted in a flood of beans pouring into the 
United States, the world's biggest coffee market. 
</P>
<P>
Rejection could mean huge losses for importers and brokers, particularly now 
that producers can't rely on the agreement to sell their coffee beans and 
therefore must compete on quality. 
</P>
<P>
Though the rejected coffee isn't discarded, it may sit longer in a warehouse, 
could be sold at a discount or end up as a roasted blend or generic-brand 
instant, the coffee equivalent of an old horse sent to the glue factory. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular day, about $2 million worth of coffee -- or nearly 2.5 
million pounds -- is at stake. But there were periods in the past two years 
when all was quiet in what's known in coffee parlance as "the grading room." 
</P>
<P>
"There was absolutely nothing going on for four to five months, nothing, zero," 
says Glenn Garnes, grading room assistant at the exchange where coffee, sugar 
and cocoa contracts are traded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bypassed Exchange 
</P>
<P>
Coffee sold quickly in those days because of export quotas set by the 
International Coffee Organization, the cartel of producers that artificially 
determined prices through limiting the supply. 
</P>
<P>
Tight supplies and high demand meant that a lot of coffee bypassed the exchange 
and went directly to brokers or roasters. 
</P>
<P>
With more beans to judge these days the tasters must slurp more mouthfuls of 
coffee. Since they're paid by the number of bags tested, their take has 
increased to about $630 for nearly two hours' work, which amounts to more than 
$12 a slurp. During normal periods they earn about $200. 
</P>
<P>
On July 4, the ICO temporarily suspended export ceilings that had kept 
wholesale prices at between $1.20 and $1.40 a pound. U.S. roasters had 
criticized the quotas for limiting access to quality coffee. 
</P>
<P>
With coffee pouring into the United States, prices have tumbled nearly 40% and 
made it a buyers' market. 
</P>
<P>
Further depressing prices is the normal slow summer roasting period, a 
long-term decline in U.S. coffee consumption and efforts by producers to empty 
warehouses before the new harvest starting in September. 
</P>
<P>
"If the market is already at these levels in anticipation of new crops what 
will happen when the new crop actually comes?," says Bert Ruiz, industry 
analyst with the New York brokerage firm Balfour Maclaine Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Dropping 
</P>
<P>
Retail prices also have fallen. Two of the biggest roasters, General Foods 
Corp. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which have about 65% of the U.S. coffee 
market, announced big price cuts Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
General Foods, which markets Maxwell House and Sanka coffees, said it dropped 
the average price it charges retailers 23 cents a pound for ground roasted 
coffee. Procter &amp; Gamble, marketer of Folgers, lowered its price by 20 
cents to about $2.50 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
There's not much talking in the grading room as the testers judge the coffee 
first by color and grade, or purity. Working in teams of three, they sort 
through pans of small green coffee beans for imperfections -- brown, black, 
rotten or faded beans. 
</P>
<P>
Dirt and other impurities count against the batch. Every five bad beans, or one 
black bean, equals one imperfection. Fifteen imperfections disqualifies the 
entire lot. 
</P>
<P>
Color also is important because as coffee ages it loses moisture and fades, 
says taster Steve Colten, quality control manager for J. Aron &amp; Co. coffee 
importers. Colten and the 26 other graders, including two women recently added 
to the erstwhile male group, leave jobs or other activities to grade coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Each pan, representing one 37,500-pound lot, is numbered so that the testers 
know only the country of origin. 
</P>
<P>
"We work blind so nothing biases our opinion," says Bill Griffin, former senior 
buyer for Nestle Foods Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing the country is important because shades of color differ as do acidity 
and flavor, tasters say. Coffees with earthy, fermented characteristics 
passable for one country's coffees wouldn't be for another. 
</P>
<P>
A tantalizing aroma fills the room as the beans are thrown into old-fashioned 
roasters for browning over an open flame. The beans are then ground and steeped 
in boiling water in preparation for tasting, the ultimate proving ground. 
</P>
<P>
With a loud slurp Ray Schlegelmilch sucks in a spoonful of brew, twirls it 
around his tongue and spits into a silver spittoon near his feet. Quickly 
adjusting the swivel-top table, he brings the next cup into position, breaks 
through the film of grounds atop the liquid, scoops another mouthful and 
repeats the ritual. In a matter of seconds, he has tasted 21 cups. 
</P>
<P>
Body, the right twinge of acidity and a good "bouquet" or aroma are important. 
But tasters look for "negative rather than positive characteristics," says 
Justin Colten, a former executive with J. Aron, who believes that coffee 
tasting is "a very unique art." 
</P>
<P>
Anything "off odor," -- a dirty or musty smell -- or that tastes too acidic, 
leathery, fermented, medicinal or earthy is rejected. 
</P>
<P>
This day, a Mexican coffee that has already passed color and grade tests is 
rejected on taste. Garnes calls the importer, who requests a second opinion. 
Three more tasters are asked to judge the brew. It passes on second tasting. 
</P>
<P>
The testers, all current or retired coffee-industry executives, are purists 
about coffee outside the grading room, too. Some are so choosy that they won't 
buy coffee already roasted, much less ground. Several buy raw beans and roast 
them at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone in the coffee business is very picky about their coffee," says Steve 
Colten. 
</P>
<P>
As for the latest fad -- flavored coffee, which is marinated in liquid 
flavorings ranging from cinnamon to coconut -- the tasters turn up their noses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's adulterated," says one. 
</P>
<P>
"No one grows cinnamon-nut flavored coffee," says another. "If you get a good 
cup of coffee, you don't need flavorings. You don't even need cream or sugar."

FOR EXPERTS, INSTANT FAME'S VEXING -- BUT FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Voyager spacecraft transmitted colorful pictures of Neptune to Earth, 
assistant project manager Ellis Miner bounced from interviews on the Cable News 
Network to a network news program to the British Broadcasting Corp. faster than 
he could say "frozen nitrogen crystals." 
</P>
<P>
When he finished with television, radio beckoned. He appeared on six call-in 
shows throughout the nation and scores of live radio interviews, including KNX 
and KFWB. During the three to four days before Voyager's closest approach to 
Neptune, he said he spent 13 hours daily at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, 
about 10 hours a day answering press queries. 
</P>
<P>
Miner's backbreaking agenda during a major news event is not unusual for those 
considered experts by the media. 
</P>
<P>
When China convulsed under the pressure of student revolt recently, Kenneth 
Lieberthal appeared on "Nightline," CNN's "Newswatch," the "MacNeil/Lehrer 
NewsHour" and "This Week With David Brinkley." For a week, the specialist in 
Chinese politics at the University of Michigan averaged eight radio and four 
television interviews a day. 
</P>
<P>
"The calls would begin between 5 or 6 in the morning and not end until 10:30 at 
night," he recalled. "I was either being interviewed or handling requests for 
interviews 100% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
These smooth pros, who thrive on frantic schedules, enjoy the exposure, the 
chance to reach millions of viewers, instead of dozens of students, and the 
boost in consulting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But newcomers used to lonely pursuit of arcane issues sometimes find the 
spotlight vexing. They complain that the media demands cut into their leisure 
time, take them away from research and force them to communicate directly with 
the public. Then, if they are even remotely successful with the media, they may 
worry that colleagues regard them as superficial. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Siegel was more than surprised by the response to a paper she published 
last winter. With her first scholarly papers, the associate professor of public 
health at UCLA got no more than two or three requests for interviews. But when 
she published findings on how men and women resist sexual assault, reporters 
kept her on the phone for a full day and deluged her with questions for two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"You could not put the phone down before another (call) was there," she said. 
"Plus the phone in the (UCLA) media office was ringing all day. So there were 
people waiting in line to interview me." 
</P>
<P>
All the major morning news shows -- NBC's "Today," CBS' "This Morning" and 
ABC's "Good Morning America" -- competed for her appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel, who had planned to leave town on vacation, asked the UCLA news bureau 
to decide which show she should appear on. "Believe it or not," she said, "I 
had lost interest in publicity. This was supposed to be my vacation and it was 
anything but relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
The news bureau scheduled her to appear on the "Today" show. "They wanted to 
fly me to New York," Siegel said, "but I didn't want to because it would take 
two days and it was too cold in New York in January. I agreed to do it in 
studio in Burbank, but what I didn't realize is that it would be live in New 
York. So they picked me up in a limousine at 3:30 a.m. and I went on at 4:45." 
</P>
<P>
Through all the interviews, Siegel worried because she thought the media were 
stretching her findings. 
</P>
<P>
"The article I wrote was a summary of findings about what people did in 
response to threats of assault, and the media were trying to make me turn it 
into recommendations about what you should do in the event of assault," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After relying on professional jargon for years to speak with colleagues, some 
newcomers have trouble learning to talk in simple lay terms. 
</P>
<P>
"Your own professional jargon is different," said UCLA pediatrician Judy 
Howard, whose specialties includes child abuse and prenatal drug exposure, "and 
it's important that you not be misinterpreted. . . . You try to make it 
extremely clear. . . . When you haven't chosen politics as a profession, you 
have to learn all this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Return Appearances 
</P>
<P>
If they answer the questions intelligently and concisely just once, the media 
phone them again and again. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the media necessarily go to the best scholars in the sense of 
people doing the greatest theoretical work or most sophisticated modeling," 
said Lieberthal, who nonetheless thinks good commentary on China requires good 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the media tend to go back to people like me who can summarize things 
well -- people who can do a good 40-second sound bite or who in newspapers can 
speak the king's English rather than political science or sociology or 
economics," Lieberthal said. 
</P>
<P>
While the work is demanding, there are payoffs. Their success can lead to 
sometimes hefty consultancy fees. Several professional teams have hired UC 
Berkeley sociologist Harry Edwards, an expert on the black athlete, for 
example, and he has worked with the baseball commissioner's campaign to move 
blacks into management. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal says working with the media also provide heady opportunities. "I 
love it," he said. "I like teaching. . . . Dealing with the media gives me an 
opportunity to have an audience in the millions, instead of the dozens." 
</P>
<P>
Although he says visibility has no effect on his academic career, he knows 
university administrators recognize his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
When he appeared extensively on national media last May and June, Lieberthal 
said, "I was contacted by people in the administration concerned with public 
affairs to say how grateful they were. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the local newspaper ran a brief editorial which said, 'Isn't it nice that 
Michigan is recognized for something beyond it's football team?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Negative Side 
</P>
<P>
Experts also see negatives to offering public opinions. "There is a slight 
sense that someone quoted a lot must be somewhat superficial," said Peter 
Reuter, senior economist at the RAND Corp. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
If the researchers are perceived as experts, they feel they have a greater 
responsibility to the public so they review their work even more carefully than 
before. "That's very trying at times because you keep rechecking . . . the 
specifics," said UCLA pediatrician Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Some people talk so regularly to the media that it hurts their academic career. 
</P>
<P>
"I get lots of requests to fly here or there to give a lecture," said Dr. Paul 
D. Thompson, a cardiologist at Miriam Hospital in Providence, R.I., and a 
frequent commentator on exercise physiology. "What that does is take me out of 
the lab and the chance to do research." 
</P>
<P>
The experts' families may be more indulgent of the media demands than the 
academics themselves. Edwards says his wife and children, who cavalierly 
disregard frequent intrusions in restaurants by television viewers, put useful 
newspaper clippings on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Eye of the Storm 
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal recalls that when he was in Tokyo late last May, he called his wife 
at home to ask whether she thought he should return to Beijing as Chinese 
troops organized a dangerous move on the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I said my inclination was to go," Lieberthal said. "She said 'Frankly, you 
have spent your whole life studying Chinese politics. This is Chinese politics 
in the raw and you should go.' 
</P>
<P>
"She also said that if you see them about to shoot, promise you will get the 
hell out of there and give me a call and tell me you made it. Which is what I 
did. 
</P>
<P>
"The troops were about to move in on June 3 and the massacre came on June 4. I 
called just before midnight on the third and said I wanted to tell her I was in 
my hotel room because I had just come in from the street."

MALIBU METAMORPHOSIS; 
</P>
<P>
IS HOLLYWOOD'S HAVEN GROWING INTO JUST ANOTHER MIAMI BEACH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIKKI FINKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Its embattled mayor makes headlines. Its brand-new Jaguars and vintage Mustangs 
clog the streets. Its mini-malls blight the landscape with yet more porcelain 
nail clinics. And, of course, its most anticipated restaurant is Wolfgang 
Puck's. 
</P>
<P>
This must be Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. Welcome to Malibu and its not-so-mellow metamorphosis. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a century, people ranging from film stars to just plain folks 
have sought out this laid-back sun and surf refuge in hopes of getting away 
from it all. 
</P>
<P>
Now the "all" is coming to Malibu in the form of auto congestion, expensive 
sewer systems, big bucks hotel-condo complexes, status eateries and a 
referendum on cityhood, not to mention honorary mayor Martin Sheen's open 
invitation to the homeless. And the question is whether the so-called Malibu 
life style made famous by movies, miniseries and, yes, even creme de menthes 
("Malibu" is a popular after-dinner drink) can survive as this once bucolic 
paradise becomes a hotbed of controversy and construction, trendiness and just 
plain turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
It's also wondering, if and when Malibu goes the way of Miami Beach with 
high-rises and hotels covering every inch of shoreline as many residents fear, 
whether celebrities will stay put and fight the changes or just find some other 
heavenly haven to inhabit. 
</P>
<P>
When Burgess Meredith, a Malibu Colony resident for more than a decade, tries 
to explain what's happening to his beloved community, he recalls the time a 
sheriff came to warn him and his houseguest, the late director John Huston, 
that a tidal wave was heading their way. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned to John and asked, 'What are we going to do?' And he said, 'Don't 
worry. We'll take it to higher ground.' " 
</P>
<P>
The tidal wave, says Meredith, eventually headed in another direction. 
"However, that would have been a pleasure when compared to the tidal wave 
that's coming the other way now." 
</P>
<P>
Other longtime residents are just as fearful for Malibu's future. "I'm not a 
political animal, and I have nothing against Malibu growing," concedes Rod 
Steiger, a 32-year Malibu homesteader. "But what's most worrying is the idea of 
growth without a responsibility to preserve the natural beauty that the gods 
have given us for all the people -- the 20,000 who live here and the millions 
who come here to visit every summer." 
</P>
<P>
To Ali MacGraw, Malibu's ex-Her Honor who grudgingly moved to Pacific Palisades 
in July when she couldn't find any ocean-view housing she could afford, Malibu 
is "at a critical crossroads in its history. Either we're going to galvanize 
the community, or it will be the end of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"But you know," she confides, dispiritedly, "three people living on the same 
street in Malibu can't get together to decide on a speed bump. So I'm not too 
optimistic about the bigger issues." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some people can't help wondering what all the fuss is about in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that, like the oft-heard complaint about Los Angeles, there is no 
"there" there. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Malibu is little more than a blueprint for a town whose planner 
obviously went mad, with its countrified collection of garage fronts, 
ramshackle stores and sushi bars, and the occasional frozen yogurt franchise 
dotting 27 miles of Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
But if this resort only 35 miles from downtown L.A. still seems the playground 
of the rich and rarely employed -- though only one-fifth of the population 
probably works in the entertainment industry -- then obviously the myth of 
Malibu is alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is because there really is something to that "Way of Life" which 
Malibu's citizenry proudly proclaim on their license plates: a trading in of 
life's punishments for life's pleasures, forsaking Spago for unsmogged sunsets, 
swapping suits for sweats, forgetting wheeling and dealing for marinading, 
taking a break from dailies to watch dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's impossible to define the definitive Malibu life style when its 
residents are so diverse. At any given moment, they range from retirees on 
fixed incomes, to ranchers raising Arabians, to the latest personality on the 
cover of People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
It's where the cops take cappucino breaks, Sean Penn hitchhikes and the Kiwanis 
Club holds a chili cook-off every Labor Day and raffles off -- what else? -- a 
Porsche. Naturally, programming for the public-access cable channel, KBU, 
consists of babes in bikinis, surfing contests and bulletins about the 
activities of the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, it's finding some small-town atmosphere within the vast Los 
Angeles County region that perhaps has grown too big for its own good. For 
longtime resident Carol Rapf, "it's being on a first-name basis with the 
homeless person who's set up camp next to my house. This morning, when I went 
for a walk, he waved to me and said, 'Hi, Carol.' " 
</P>
<P>
As for the homeless someday outnumbering the homeowners, even Martin Sheen 
admits he didn't anticipate the media maelstrom that erupted, much less the 
jokes by Johnny Carson on "The Tonight Show" suggesting that Malibu celebrities 
were offering to pay for valet parking and free sunblock for those homeless who 
took Sheen up on his offer of sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, it seemed the majority of the community supported me," maintains 
Sheen, who has stood by his social concern even though a "Dump Martin for 
Mayor" campaign was mounted by the nonplussed chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the hypnotic combination of cash and controversy goes back to 
Malibu's roots. First, there were its earliest settlers, the Chumash Indians 
who named it Humaliwa ("the surf that sounds loud"). Then came Massachusetts 
millionaires Frederick and Rhoda Rindge, who bought the land parcel in 1891 for 
$10 an acre and kept the Southern Pacific Railway and government highway 
interests from developing their domain, even hiring armed guards, until the 
courts stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
Silent movie actress Anna Q. Nilsson in 1928 was the first celebrity to build a 
summer home in the sandy crescent just north of Malibu Creek that quickly 
became known as the Malibu Motion Picture Colony. The studios immediately 
promoted the area as a close-to-the-city refuge for stars such as Clara Bow, 
Barbara Stanwyck, Ronald Colman and Dolores Del Rio, who normally would have 
ventured further afield to build their $3,500 beach bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
During the Depression and World War II, the area lost some pizazz, though the 
Malibu Inn became a well-known gambling oasis and watering hole for those stars 
who stayed. In the postwar boom years, Malibu was home to middle-class families 
in search of suburban tranquillity as well as surfing disciples of the Big 
Kahuna himself, Duke Kahanamoku. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the 1960s -- when there were still empty lots in Malibu Colony 
and Lana Turner its lone celebrity resident in 1964 -- that Annette, Frankie 
and the Beach Boys started having fun under the sun and Malibu housing prices 
soared into the ozone. 
</P>
<P>
By 1969, the year Rex Reed published his infamous magazine article about Malibu 
being the birthplace of the "cesspool of L.A. culture," marijuana smoke 
combined with midsummer mists to create an almost permanent haze over the sand 
dunes. Over the next decade, Jerry Brown courted Linda Ronstadt inside the 
Colony, Primal Scream fanatics like Dyan Cannon found private places to shout, 
and endless parties, group sex and real estate hustling were reputed to be 
widespread among residents and renters -- or maybe it was just fashionable to 
say so. 
</P>
<P>
There also was the requisite cult-leader-in-residence -- in this case Guru 
Maharaj Ji, who made his followers toil at menial jobs so he could build a 
lavish hilltop estate atop Trancas Canyon in the late 1970s complete with 
helicopter pad. And a chopper is exactly what many commuters wished they had in 
1979 after PCH was closed behind two state-installed chain-link fences for a 
month when rockslides sent chunks of crumbling bluff onto the road. 
</P>
<P>
But the shared experience of weathering Malibu's many natural disasters is what 
continues to preserve the community's "us against them" camaraderie, whether 
it's watching Cicely Tyson shovel the sand out of her swimming pool after a 
legendary storm or Rachel Ward escape an uncontrolled brush fire that scorched 
80,000 acres and destroyed homes. 
</P>
<P>
Even when forced to evacuate, Malibuites tend to react differently in a crisis 
than other people, like the movie producer who grabbed his dog, a toothbrush 
and two scripts before his house was about to burn. And MacGraw remembers one 
winter when mudslides seemed certain after days and nights of rain. "I figured 
that the locust plagues were next. So I packed my son Josh in the car with a 
friend and drove to Santa Fe." 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I have infinite faith in is what I glibly describe as the inherent 
forces of nature," explains Ann Soble, editor of the Malibu Surfside News. 
"Malibu shifts, slides, twists and turns. Maybe we need some more healthy 
rumbles out here or maybe a couple of good storms to scare people and keep 
things in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s will be remembered as the decade when Malibuites moved into the 
mainstream in terms of modern conveniences, no matter if there's still only one 
movie theater, a single highway going in and out of the community which forces 
residents to plan their movements with the precision of a Pentagon invasion, 
and old-fashioned septic tanks which occasionally overflow but get credit for 
keeping development to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after a decade of putting up with less-than-gourmet grocery stores and 
just two truly fine restaurants, Malibu La Scala and Splash, a new era has 
dawned. At least that's how residents describe the new shopping center in back 
of the Malibu Colony with a 24-hour Hughes Supermarket and the imminent arrival 
of Granita, the $2-million Mediterranean bistro that Wolfgang Puck hopes to 
have ready by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
For Larry Hagman, a 23-year veteran of Malibu Colony with his wife, Maj, 
zipping down to the new shopping center for fresh croissants and brioches on 
his Yamaha motor scooter is the "best thing ever," he gushes. Even so, a vocal 
group of neighborhood residents including Burgess Meredith tried to thwart even 
these meager efforts at trendiness. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand that they would be concerned about any new business going on. 
If I had a house there, I would, too," sympathizes Puck's wife and partner, 
Barbara Lazaroff. "But the majority of people in Malibu are really excited 
about the restaurant. After all, they are customers at Spago and Chinois 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night dinner reservations at La Scala are so hard to get in summer, 
for instance, that holiday weekends can be booked as much as a year in advance. 
"There's probably more business transacted at La Scala on a Saturday night than 
in most of Hollywood during the summer time," says publisher Arnold York. 
</P>
<P>
That is, if you can be heard. One-time producer Jerry Weintraub was dining at 
La Scala's old location (the restaurant moved to new quarters in June) when he 
received a call from a good friend in Washington. Weintraub had to take the 
telephone into a walk-in refrigerator in the restaurant's kitchen because the 
dining room was so noisy he couldn't hear a word. 
</P>
<P>
"George, you wouldn't believe where I am," Weintraub told then Vice President 
George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Malibu enters the 1990s as more of an entertainment community enclave 
than ever. This summer, by all accounts, has seen more movie, television and 
music stars and executives buying and renting in the resort. 
</P>
<P>
The Colony, as usual, gets more than its fair share of the famous because of 
its guarded security entrance, even though the houses are so close together 
that when residents get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, 
they may wind up at their neighbor's. Still, some think it's worth the steep 
price of admission -- houses $2 million and up -- to see longtime resident Don 
Rickles standing on his deck like Caesar and screaming, "How does it feel to 
live in paradise?" or stalwart Larry Hagman playing beach Frisbee beyond the 
seawall, or occasional renter Robert Redford offering to throw a football to 
his neighbor, Beverly Hills developer and L.A. Clippers owner Donald T. 
Sterling. 
</P>
<P>
"If Robert Redford wants to send you a pass, you go," laughs Sterling, who 
since moving to the Colony in the mid-1970s has stayed unabashedly star-struck. 
"I pull out my car, and the Million-Dollar Man -- Lee Majors -- invites me to 
watch a game on television. And, the other day, Pia Zadora announces that her 
little girl wants to have lunch with my son." 
</P>
<P>
Carbon Beach, better known as "Deal Beach" because of all the entertainment 
industry honchos who have houses there, lays claim to Warners president Terry 
Semel, Disney Studios president Jeffrey Katzenberg, former Fox president 
Leonard Goldberg, Columbia Television Chairman Gary Lieberthal, and producers 
David Geffen, Freddie Fields, Jerry Bruckheimer, Bob Chartoff, Fred Silverman 
and Alan Landsburg. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, industry insiders in-the-know are buying near Broad Beach, where 
Disney Chairman Frank Wells, Creative Artists Agency founder Michael Ovitz, 
producer Grant Tinker and directors Steven Spielberg and Walter Hill live 
alongside Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Gless, Whoopi Goldberg, Goldie Hawn and Kurt 
Russell. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some celebrities have created Malibu compounds so humongous they 
comprise their own locations, including Johnny Carson, Dick Clark, Jerry 
Weintraub, Barbra Streisand (who's trying to sell hers) and Michael Landon, 
whose new home is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
And while Malibu is mainly filled with doctors, lawyers, realtors and retirees, 
along with the proverbial house-rich, cash-poor writers and producers who 
haven't sold a script or idea in years, "celebrities remain very much part of 
the ambiance," explains Arnold York, the publisher of the weekly Malibu Times. 
"But the thing that's characteristic of most Malibu people, whether famous or 
not, is they really want to be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a town," notes Ali MacGraw, "where it makes no difference whether you are 
highly recognizable, or a guy who works for the phone company. Nobody is 
interested in anything except what kind of neighbor you are." 
</P>
<P>
But Malibu's definition of good neighborliness is now under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Surprising as it is given their penchant for national political activism, many 
Malibu celebrities for the most part have not taken an active role in deciding 
their community's future. "They'll write a check or get involved in motherhood 
issues like saving the mountain lion or banning fruit pesticides. But some have 
told me they don't want to get involved in knock-down, drag-out political 
fights here because they think that's not good for business," says one Malibu 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Some celebrities, however, are getting deeply embroiled in the current debate. 
Rod Steiger, for instance, has joined with his wife, Paula, who is active in 
the community's slow-growth campaign, and has appeared at several government 
meetings in connection with a large condominium complex near his home that he 
is fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some celebrities who are longtime residents like Olivia Newton-John, 
Dick Clark, Michael Landon, Rich Little, Cheech Marin and others who are there 
for every single solitary thing that we need, either money or emotional 
support," MacGraw points out. "But there's an awful lot of people out there 
with a ton of money who don't really give a damn about the place they live. 
When I was helping to raise money for the Malibu Emergency Room and called some 
people I know, I just couldn't believe when they said no. Because where are 
they going to go when their kids fall off the skateboard? Right now, they just 
want to make sure that they've got parking for 16." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills realtor Stan Herman, for instance, stays studiously uninvolved. 
Wanting to share in Malibu's sun and sand over 20 years ago, he chose -- in 
typical Malibu fashion -- a weekend home on Carbon Beach that's elbow-to-elbow 
with others. While he knows the community is changing -- "obviously the traffic 
has increased substantially" -- he's content to stay put more or less 
permanently. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I drive through my gates and walk through my doors, nothing has changed 
about Malibu for me. The sand is the same. The ocean is the same. And that's 
why I love it." 
</P>
<P>
It is this "drawbridge mentality," as some activists describe it, that angers 
those residents willing to put themselves on the line for the benefit of their 
community. They say part-timers who don't have as much of a stake in the 
community are creating a Bel Air-by-the-Sea -- now that having a second or 
third home in Malibu is once again a "status symbol" among the entertainment 
industry set. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, everybody you've ever heard of has bought a home out here. But 
there's no conscience about community from the new arrivals. And it's 
devastating. Really devastating. I feel the change," MacGraw complains. "I hope 
that all those people get bored and discover Laguna." 
</P>
<P>
That may happen. 
</P>
<P>
Says Hagman: "Sure, Malibu will look like Newport someday with those huge 
complexes and new houses. That's one of the reasons I've bought a place in 
Ojai." 
</P>
<P>
He's not alone. "A celebrity told me once they were not really concerned what 
happens to Malibu. And I said, 'Tell me why,' " recalls Ann Soble, editor of 
the Malibu Surfside News. 
</P>
<P>
"And they took another sip of wine and said, 'If Malibu is no longer a place 
that I want to be, I'll go somewhere else.' "

HER WORLD: SONOMA COUNTY FILLS HER SHOPPING BASKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to fresh produce that is enticingly displayed -- no games, no 
lines, no coupons -- my favorite market may be bountiful Sonoma County. 
</P>
<P>
There is little on my list that is not sold along its two-lane country roads 
that ramble from sea to wine slopes just 50 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Farm stands, wineries and cheese makers offer home-grown wonders and a bunch of 
rare tastes. Berries are plump and plentiful: strawberries, blueberries, 
blackberries, loganberries, raspberries and even olallieberries -- a name I 
love, but a berry I've not yet tried. 
</P>
<P>
Tart and juicy Gravenstein apples are honored with a fair each summer in 
Sebastopol, a major apple-growing area just 10 minutes west of Santa Rosa. Rome 
Beauty apples are harvested in November, and glow like small red balloons on 
roadside stands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pumpkins and Persimmons 
</P>
<P>
In October the roads are tawny with rows of fat pumpkins and baskets of ripe 
persimmons. 
</P>
<P>
I like to start shopping at the green plaza in the heart of Sonoma, a town that 
wears yesteryear well. Trees are tall and old. The northernmost of the 
California missions is here, and so is the big Sebastiani winery, as well as 
the state's oldest winery -- Buena Vista -- founded in 1857. 
</P>
<P>
This is a good place to pick up a free map of Sonoma County Farm Trails and to 
plot your main course and wild appetizers. The map -- updated each spring -- 
lists 170 "agri-destinations" by their specialties, and by the harvest seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Many farms and vineyards have shady picnic areas where you can savor natural 
juices or wine with stone-ground crackers and goat cheese. Figs a' Plenty in 
Sonoma offers ripe, you-pick black Mission figs in September and October. 
</P>
<P>
The Sonoma Cheese Factory is a favorite stop for wheels of dry Sonoma Jack, 
which has a nutty flavor that reminds me of Parmesan. They also make a tempting 
soft cheese laced with jalapeno peppers. I usually leave a trail of Christmas 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Designer Mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
Farm signs splay out from Sebastopol and through the neighboring towns of 
Forestville, Bloomfield, Valley Ford and Freestone. 
</P>
<P>
They boast of exotic vegetables: designer mushrooms, red Russian kale, giant 
kohlrabi, celadon cabbage, speckled butter lettuce. Organic farms sell 
grasslands of fresh herbs for cooking, and for diet and health. A few farms are 
by appointment only. 
</P>
<P>
From May to November there are lively farmers' markets in Healdsburg and 
Petaluma. Such European-style markets are open throughout the year in Santa 
Rosa and Sonoma. Besides fruits, there are sausages, vinegars, potpourri, bees, 
pigs, chukars, rabbits, honey, jams, jerky, gourmet popcorn, Christmas trees 
and plants. 
</P>
<P>
Some farms raise puppies and kittens. Exotic game birds are the specialty at 
Oak Crest Farm in Sebastopol, which lists Toulouse geese and Rouen ducks as 
well as Hampshire hogs. Those large items I could resist, as I was traveling by 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Miniature Horses 
</P>
<P>
Petaluma, once known as the egg capital of the world and then the arm-wrestling 
capital, has branched out with farms that sell fresh oysters, miniature horses 
for pets or show, Indian corn, fancy gourds, Monterey pines, Douglas firs, 
cactus and bromeliads. They still offer alder-smoked chickens, turkeys and lots 
of fresh eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Business names run from the straightforward (Petaluma Mushroom Farm or Grossi 
Family Pumpkins of Santa Rosa) to the precious (Chicken Crossing, Lucky Duck, 
Family Tree). 
</P>
<P>
One of my Santa Rosa favorites is Adams and Friend, which is owned by Barbara 
Adams and Ilene Friend. They sell rabbits, live and dressed, as well as Angora 
for spinning. Naturally, where there are farms, there are crafts. 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma's farms may be small, but the rich, rolling county is one and a half 
times the size of Rhode Island. So slow down a bit when marketing there. The 
pleasure should not be rushed. 
</P>
<P>
I know all too well. Last time I had only a weekend. I'm already out of 
kohlrabies.

TRAVEL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS; 
</P>
<P>
GETTING A TASTE OF THE FRENCH WINE COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC FRIEDHEIM, Friedheim is editor/publisher of Travel Agent magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: We're planning a tour to the French wine country. Where are the 
tasting centers and what do they charge? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Most growing areas and vintners have tasting facilities. The principal 
wine-tasting services are at Beane, Burgundy; the Champagne Information Center 
at Epernay, and the Wine Information Center at Bordeaux. Tasting is free. You 
can also sample wines for a modest fee at Academie du Vin, 25 Rue Royale, 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What merchandise made from birds or other animals in the Caribbean may not 
be brought back by travelers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Crocodile leather, sea turtle shells and spotted cat skins are forbidden 
items. Some islands also ban the export of coral. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We'd like to tour Canada's Northwest Territories and Yukon late this summer 
or early fall, using campgrounds. How long are those areas open? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some operate from May to October, others are open all year. Contact Travel 
Arctic, Government of Northwest, Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada X1A 
2I9, and Tourism Yukon, Box 2703-AT, Whitehorse, Yukon Y1A 2C6. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'm planning a motor trip. Should I use a travel agent for hotel 
reservations or rely on automobile clubs? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Agents can book your accommodations but usually aren't geared to do as much 
for motorists as AAA and similar organizations that provide maps, counsel, 
emergency and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Traveling on smaller aircraft, I noticed the space between first-class seat 
rows is no greater than in economy. Shouldn't the higher fare provide more 
room? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Such spacing differs among airlines. Though first- and business-class seats 
are wider, they may not have more reclining space than in economy class.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: HERE'S ONE COMPANY WITH A DIFFERENT SPIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES, Hughes is a 30-year veteran travel writer living in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An around-the-world Christmas shopping tour or a two-week spring training tour 
with the Dodgers is not exactly a typical tour for the mature traveler. Neither 
is the tour operator, World Adventures in Travel, an ordinary tour company. 
</P>
<P>
As a new member of the Senior Travel and Recreation Activities Council (Strac), 
World Adventures caters to the senior traveler, though a special type of 
traveler, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tours appeal to the well-traveled senior," says Phyllis Corliss, who with 
her husband Dick started World Adventures four years ago. The two have 17 
years' experience running tours. 
</P>
<P>
"Tours are for the seasoned traveler looking for an upscale tour. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our key points is that our tours are at the right place at the right 
time -- to be in New England at the peak of fall foliage, to see East Africa 
during the Great Migration or to enjoy the Fairy Penguin parade in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"We prefer small groups," Phyllis adds. "We like to think of them as a 10-, 
20-day or longer private party of friends. And we make sure it works that way." 
</P>
<P>
World Adventures features some popular domestic trips plus Africa, Australia 
and the South Pacific, in addition to the round-the-world trips and upscale 
cruises. It averages only nine to 12 destinations a year, but with about 30 
departure dates. 
</P>
<P>
And with terms like "upscale," "trendy" and "small groups" you might conclude 
that World Adventures tours are not budget-oriented, or moderate. Expensive is 
the operative word. 
</P>
<P>
The Corlisses, however, say that the seasoned traveler can recognize the value 
for the travel dollar in the hotels and dining, plus the planning that goes 
into each tour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Christmas Tour 
</P>
<P>
Some of World Adventures' remaining 1989 trips (with openings): 
</P>
<P>
 -- Christmas in Washington, D.C., and Williamsburg, Va., with Christmas Eve 
and Christmas Day in Colonial Williamsburg, including special holiday 
festivities at the Colonial Tavern and the Kings Arms Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Also included are three days in the capital at Loews L'Enfant Plaza Hotel and 
an evening performance at Kennedy Center, plus a tour of Tidewater, Va., and 
over to Charlottesville and Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. This eight-day trip, 
which includes a dozen meals plus holiday parties, costs $1,345 per person, 
double occupancy, plus air fare. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 20-day trip to Australia and New Zealand, leaving Oct. 12. This covers 
Australia's Great Barrier Reef, Alice Springs and the Outback, plus Melbourne, 
Sydney and Canberra and the best of New Zealand's North and South islands. The 
per-person price, double occupancy, is $3,395 including many meals and special 
features excluded from other tours. Air fare is $2,777 to $3,315, depending on 
the class preferred. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A few openings also remain for the Oct. 2 departure on World Adventure's 
20-day New England Fall Foliage &amp; Heritage tour that visits New England, 
plus Niagara Falls, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec in Canada, and New 
York City, Philadelphia, Valley Forge, the Pennsylvania Dutch Country and 
Gettysburg. Then it's on to Virginia and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Including top hotels, many meals and extensive sightseeing, the tour costs 
$2,995 per person, plus air fare arranged per client's choice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1990 Schedule Ready 
</P>
<P>
World Adventure's 1990 tour schedule is being printed and will be ready for 
mailing next week. It will include two feature-filled around-the-world tours, 
including the Christmas shopping tour. Space here precludes an adequate 
description of a typical World Adventure tour, which costs $12,850 per person 
(including business-class air fare). 
</P>
<P>
Also set for 1990 is the two-week "Spring Training With the Dodgers" in 
Florida. The price is still not final, but this one will include attending 
eight spring training games and meeting with many present players and past 
stars, such as Sandy Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are just being finalized for the tour company's Australia trip, set for 
April and October, 1990. It will cover Australia from coast to coast, starting

COMMUTER'S ODYSSEY TAKES 6-7 HOURS A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Call it a very long commuter bus ride. 
</P>
<P>
Alvis Holloway spends between six and seven hours a day traveling between 
Pomona, where he lives, and Venice, where he works. 
</P>
<P>
He gets up at 4 a.m. to get to work by 9, traveling 57 miles on three bus 
lines. Then he turns around and does it backwards, getting home at 8 p.m. on a 
good day. He's in bed by 10, resting up for the next grueling round trip. 
</P>
<P>
Holloway, the coordinator of a walk-in service center for alcoholics and drug 
users, lives a two-dimensional life. Working and commuting. "During the week, I 
have no social life whatsoever," says Holloway, 62, a short, barrel-chested man 
with slicked-back hair and a wispy goatee, serving to remind you of his past as 
a jazz bass player. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Rapid Transit District representatives say that in mileage 
-- if not in time -- there are longer bus rides than Holloway's, such as the 
73-mile express run between San Bernardino and downtown Los Angeles, a 
140-minute trek through two counties on the San Bernardino Freeway. There are 
even RTD commuters who change buses more often. 
</P>
<P>
But they can't identify another bus rider more consumed by the act of daily 
travel than Holloway. 
</P>
<P>
It's a long, frustrating process, says Holloway, who loves his job, at one 
extremity of Los Angeles County, and is enchanted by his Pomona senior citizens 
apartment complex, at the other. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think I'm somewhat of a nut," he confesses. 
</P>
<P>
Stress is part of the deal. The monotonous rhythm of bus tires on pavement or 
the herky-jerky of street traffic keep him mumbling the "Serenity Prayer" to 
himself. That's the well-known Alcoholics Anonymous anthem about having 
serenity to accept the things you can't change, courage to change the things 
that should be changed and wisdom to know the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is, says Holloway, a recovering alcoholic who's been on the wagon for 
six years, to remember that there's nothing he can do about delays, breakdowns 
and slowdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Last month, the bus broke down three days in a row," he says. "They don't send 
a replacement. You just have to stand there and wait for the next bus." 
</P>
<P>
This is a time of unusual dissatisfaction with public transit in the San 
Gabriel Valley. Twenty cities, claiming that the area is treated by RTD as a 
poor relation, want to pull out of the RTD system altogether to start what they 
say will be a more responsive, cost-efficient transit system using private 
operators. The county Transportation Commission has authorized them to set up 
the Foothill Transit Zone, a three-year experiment to contract with private 
companies to take over much of RTD's San Gabriel Valley service. 
</P>
<P>
"RTD acts as if they don't give a damn whether you ride with them or not," says 
Holloway. "It seems to me, they even try to discourage you." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly, Foothill executives pipe in. While maps of the RTD bus system show the 
San Fernando Valley covered by a neat, all-encompassing grid, there are large 
empty spaces in the San Gabriel Valley, where bus service is a distant amenity, 
critics say. 
</P>
<P>
And the prospects are for bigger empty spots still. Because of low ridership 
and the high cost of suburban bus service, the area has been targeted for 
further RTD service reductions. The buses that do operate in the area break 
down frequently and run behind schedule, the critics say. 
</P>
<P>
"There are big holes in the (RTD) service," says William Forsythe, executive 
director of Foothill. Before a Supreme Court action brought by RTD drivers and 
mechanics put a hold last week on expansion by Foothill, the private system had 
already taken over seven RTD lines, including two express routes from Glendora 
and Diamond Bar to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No RTD Comment 
</P>
<P>
An RTD spokeswoman said that, because the transfer of lines to Foothill is 
still in litigation, she could not comment on critics' complaints. "All I can 
say is that RTD is concerned about maintaining a regional transportation 
system, which better serves the public than breaking the system up into 
individual zones," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the rider level, the complaints usually stick to the asphalt-level 
nitty-gritty. Riders at the El Monte Bus Terminal, the mecca for San Gabriel 
Valley public transportation where 700 buses a day pick up and discharge 
passengers on a carousel-like platform, talk about long waits on street 
corners, jammed buses and insufficient seats for all the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Marcella Gomez, a secretary for an El Monte insurance agency, said 
she has to give herself an extra half-hour every morning in case of delays in 
the trip from her home in West Covina. "You never know what time the buses are 
going to pass by," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There are delays and more delays. But often it's not RTD's fault, passengers 
acknowledge. "It takes a long time on hot days," says Patricia Yung, a 
secretary in a downtown import-export firm. "That's when there are breakdowns 
on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaves Early 
</P>
<P>
Holloway's day begins about 5:15 a.m., when he leaves the apartment he shares 
with his wife, Margaret, on 3rd Street and walks two blocks in inky darkness to 
the bus stop on Mission Boulevard. "I always leave earlier than I have to," 
says Holloway, "because the buses can run late and, if you wait too long, you 
have to stand up." 
</P>
<P>
It is 15 minutes before RTD's 480 bus shows up. "A lot of your bus time is tied 
up in waiting," he says. "The actual time in transit isn't that bad." The bus 
stop is on a sidewalk, next to a vacant lot. "What am I supposed to do out here 
when it's raining?" he says. "During the winter, I get soaked at least once a 
week." 
</P>
<P>
There are still plenty of seats at that hour, and Holloway settles next to a 
window. They're not individual seats, as on an airline, but cramped "love 
seats," each accommodating two passengers. "Not very conducive to relaxation," 
says Holloway. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit-born Holloway is a loquacious man, full of stories about his long 
and varied life ("I've been cut, stabbed and shot") and bits of wisdom ("I've 
never seen anybody go out with a smile on their face," he says, talking about a 
job he once held in a funeral parlor. "Everybody's struggling for just one more 
breath.") 
</P>
<P>
He has been a bass player, a dental technician and a professional boxer, 
fighting briefly as a light heavyweight with the nickname "Baby Bull." 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you think they called me that?" he says, leaning forward in his seat to 
give you a clear view. "No neck." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Afford Car 
</P>
<P>
An emphysema patient who suffered a heart attack seven years ago, Holloway is 
passionate about helping people with disabilities on his job, for which he 
earns a salary too modest to afford a car. Holloway was paying more than $120 a 
month ($6.40 a day) in bus fares before he acquired a medical disability card, 
which entitles him to monthly service for $10. 
</P>
<P>
"I very rarely miss a day," he says. "I'm so uncomfortable if I don't come to 
work, knowing that people need me, knowing that people are out there sick with 
no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
He is just as adamant about keeping his Pomona apartment. He points to a 
neighborhood in the pitch darkness. "This is where I used to live," he says. "I 
had just dozed off one night, and all of a sudden I hear bam-bam-bam, gunshots 
right there in the complex. It was that kind of a place. You had to keep your 
hand on your knife when you went in at night." 
</P>
<P>
But his current apartment, besides providing elevators, a sauna, a swimming 
pool and pool tables, is gated, with armed security guards patrolling the area. 
"You don't have to worry that some guy is going to grab your wife and put a 
knife to her throat," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Toilets 
</P>
<P>
It's 6:15, the sky is beginning to light up and traffic is already 
bumper-to-bumper on the 10 Freeway. Holloway's bus edges toward El Monte. The 
worst part of his long daily odyssey, he says, is "no toilets." Holloway must 
take a diuretic to cleanse his system of accumulated fluid. "It can put you in 
a tight spot, brother," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Holloway could leave his bus at the El Monte terminal and race downstairs to 
the men's room. But that would probably add 20 minutes to his trip, forcing him 
to wait for the next scheduled bus. At the very least, he says, he'd lose his 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
Holloway sticks with the bus, which pulls out of El Monte at 6:25. "Now we'll 
make some good time on the diamond lane," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The bus, with a full complement of snoozing service and office workers, whizzes 
past a monumental jam-up on the freeway. By 6:45, it arrives at Wilshire 
Boulevard, where Holloway, after rushing to a nearby restroom, switches to the 
320. He used to switch downtown to the Pico Boulevard bus, he says. "People 
would climb over your back, elbow you, hit you," he says. "I've seen them 
tooting coke right in the bus. Then somebody told me about this line." 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire Boulevard bus wheezes along, with Holloway perched on a rear seat. 
Office and restaurant workers jam into the bus, pressing against Holloway's 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Guys' 
</P>
<P>
Like a lot of riders, Holloway doesn't like to complain. It's not always the 
service or the drivers that are so bad, he says. "Most of the bus drivers are 
great guys," he says. "But when there's a problem with the bus, the passengers 
start cussing, ranting and raving, developing an attitude with the driver. It 
isn't his fault." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some riders at the El Monte terminal talk glowingly of the bus service. 
Despite having to program in extra time for delays, some said, you can read or 
sleep on the way. "It's easier on the nerves," said Jerry Winn, a comedian and 
magazine layout artist from Hacienda Heights. "You get on the bus, sit back and 
relax." 
</P>
<P>
As long as his ride lasts, Holloway concedes, it probably offers fewer hassles 
than if he drove a car. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire bus drops him at 6th Street in Santa Monica at 7:55. From here, 
it's easy sailing. There remains a slow trip south to Venice on the neighborly 
Santa Monica Municipal Bus Line 3. After stopping for his first container of 
coffee of the day (to avoid restroom problems, he doesn't eat or drink anything 
before he leaves his house), Holloway opens his little office, where he works 
for the Santa Monica-based Clare Foundation on Lincoln Boulevard, at 8:20. 
</P>
<P>
On a glitch-free morning, Holloway's cross-county commute has taken about three 
hours to the minute. 
</P>
<P>
Holloway settles behind his desk and merrily thinks ahead to the trip home. 
"It's a lot more crowded in the afternoon," he says. "You need the patience of 
Job."

LA VERNE ORDERS REVIEW OF MOBILE HOME RENT CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LA VERNE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A month after a federal judge ruled that a Santa Barbara law controlling mobile 
home park rents is unfair to park owners, city officials are taking another 
look at a 6-year-old ordinance that limits rent increases when a park space is 
vacated. 
</P>
<P>
City council members will not say whether La Verne is leaning towards lifting 
restrictions on rent increases for new tenants. But the City Council has hired 
an attorney to study the legal implications of a recent Santa Barbara case. A 
judge there awarded $315,000 to a park owner who claimed owners collected 
sizable profits from selling their mobile homes, but park owners gained 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne Councilman Thomas Harvey said he is against changing the city's 
ordinance. But Harvey would support relaxing some restrictions, he said, "if 
it's clear to me that we would lose in court." 
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that under "vacancy decontrol," or the process of putting 
rent-controlled property back on the free market, park owners could take 
advantage of the situation by driving out older residents in order to raise 
rents as often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
A sprinkling of cities in Southern California -- including Carson, Los Angeles, 
Rialto and Santa Monica -- have rent control ordinances that regulate the 
amount a park owner may raise rents for a new tenant. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Gabriel Valley, La Verne is the only city that regulates rents for 
new tenants of mobile home parks. Under the city's policy, when a space is 
vacated, the park owner can increase the new mobile homeowner's rent by no more 
than $25. In addition, annual rent increases may not exceed 7% and are set 
according to the consumer price index. Larger raises have to be approved by a 
committee of landlords and tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Park owners throughout the state are citing the Santa Barbara case as a legal 
precedent to city officials, warning them that ignoring it may bring a barrage 
of lawsuits. The pressure has worked in one case: The Santa Paula City Council 
recently relaxed the city's rent-control ordinance and now allows park owners 
to raise rents up to 25% whenever a tenant moves in. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Brooks, spokeswoman for the Western Mobilehome Assn., which represents 
59 park owners statewide -- and six of the eight in La Verne -- said La Verne 
could be liable for up to $2.6 million in damages, if landlords challenged the 
rent control ordinance and won. Brooks said that, although her association 
accepts the concept of limits on annual increases for existing tenants, it is 
fighting against any kind of ceiling on rates of vacated spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Mobile homes in La Verne typically sell for $30,000 more than comparable 
coaches in non-rent-controlled cities, Brooks said. The spaces are more 
valuable because rents are guaranteed to rise at a slow rate. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey acknowledged that residents will pay substantially more to live in a 
park in La Verne, but said the difference in price is closer to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne is already facing one legal challenge to its rent control ordinance. 
One of the park owners, Marvin Schwartz, is suing the city over alleged damages 
he suffered because he could not raise rents to match market values. Schwartz 
now charges $240 to $350 per month at his park, Kings Way Gardens on Arrow 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz's attorney, Robert Coldren, said the lack of a vacancy decontrol 
provision is the city's "most glaring violation of constitutional rights" of 
mobile home park owners. 
</P>
<P>
"By restricting the landlord from increasing rent, what the city has done is 
created a situation where residents have a perpetual hold on below-market 
rents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But in spite of the restrictions, the rents in La Verne mobile home parks -- 
which average $250 a month -- aren't far below other areas. Random calls to 
parks in surrounding cities found that rents in Pomona, San Dimas, and Walnut 
are equivalent to, or only slightly higher than those in La Verne. In West 
Covina, however, one park -- Friendly Village of West Covina -- charges $425 to 
$436 for a space. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Allred, La Verne's assistant city manager, said that despite the pending 
lawsuit, the ordinance has been "very successful, with very few problems" 
between park owners and residents.

IN PURSUIT OF THE CITY'S 'MIGRATING' SALES TAXES

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joan Filbey, a Long Beach native and passionate devotee of the city, loves to 
live here. But she prefers not to shop here. 
</P>
<P>
When she is in the mood for some serious buying she goes to the malls in nearby 
Lakewood or Cerritos, as do a great many of her neighbors in prosperous east 
Long Beach. As Long Beach Chamber of Commerce Vice President Matthew Faulkner 
wryly noted: "Long Beach virtually supports the Lakewood Mall." 
</P>
<P>
Such local shopping habits are a painful reality for Long Beach officials who 
for years have watched residents spend their dollars somewhere else, thus 
depriving the city of the sales tax. The city's sales tax income, one of the 
mainstays of any municipal budget, has long trailed behind the average for 
other communities in Los Angeles County, leaving less money to support basic 
city services. 
</P>
<P>
The weak flow of sales tax dollars has become even more conspicuous as the 
city's oil income has slumped and federal funds have evaporated. They have all 
contributed to tight-fisted budgets and calls for new local taxes to shore up 
recreation and police services. 
</P>
<P>
"We just haven't kept pace," said Councilman Les Robbins, who represents east 
Long Beach and admits that even though he tries to spend his money in the city, 
he too wanders over the city line to neighboring malls. 
</P>
<P>
If Long Beach were able to catch up with other cities in Los Angeles County it 
would have another $11 million a year to spend. "We could solve, as an example, 
a significant amount of our law enforcement (shortage) if we just had the 
average" sales tax income, Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last fiscal year, Long Beach's sales tax income equaled about 12% of the 
city's general fund revenue, which pays for such basic city services as the 
Police and Fire departments. The state average was nearly 19% in 1987. And in 
Cerritos, which has a highly successful regional mall and an auto mall, a third 
of the general fund revenue comes from sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
Catching up is not a simple or quick task for Long Beach, however. The reasons 
for the city's relatively feeble sales tax income -- an estimated $29 million 
for this fiscal year -- are tied to the very nature of Long Beach. The city was 
largely developed by the time regional malls emerged on the shopping scene, so 
the malls went elsewhere, and Long Beach's affluent shoppers followed. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, when marketing experts look at Long Beach, they don't find what 
they want. "A retailer wants to see a 360-degree circle filled with income," 
observed Susan Shick, the city's community development director. In Long 
Beach's downtown circle, they find the ocean, industrial areas and gritty, 
low-income neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Some neighboring cities also tend to be low income. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of fighting a losing battle to start with because we have such a 
poor market area," city Planning Director Robert Paternoster said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such discouraging marketing scenarios, Long Beach officials are forging 
ahead in eager pursuit of the sales tax dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Following the recommendations of a task force study undertaken two years ago, 
they are establishing an auto mall near the San Diego Freeway. They hope that 
the redevelopment push for new housing and office buildings downtown will bring 
more affluent buyers to invigorate the sluggish downtown shopping scene. 
</P>
<P>
They also see potential for revival of the Los Altos Center in east Long Beach 
and the Marina Pacifica Mall on Pacific Coast Highway near Westminster Avenue. 
Bank of America, which foreclosed on the bankrupt mall last spring, is trying 
to sell the half-leased Marina Pacifica to a developer who will remodel it and 
correct the many design mistakes that have contributed to its failure. And an 
Orange County developer, B.C.E. Development Inc., has bought portions of the 
Los Altos shopping center with plans to expand and enclose it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Magic Word 
</P>
<P>
But when local officials talk about pepping up the city's sales tax base, there 
is one word that brings stars to their eyes: Disney. If the Disney Development 
Corp.'s talk of building a major waterfront theme park becomes a reality, Long 
Beach budget writers will start beaming. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, where we're looking, I think, is to Disney," Robbins said. "If 
Disney does come to Long Beach, we will have solved our revenue problems. . . . 
We're talking megabucks." 
</P>
<P>
Disney has been seriously studying the possibility of constructing a $1 
billion, marine-oriented theme park at the Queen Mary site, which it obtained 
in the purchase of the Wrather Corp. A giant hotel would be built across 
Queensway Bay that would serve as a base for the theme park and Long Beach 
Convention and Entertainment Center as well. Disney officials say the complex 
would bring thousands of tourists and employees to the city every day. 
</P>
<P>
The lids to such treasure chests will not be open for years, or even decades, 
however. If dealers at the planned auto mall do no more than an average 
business, Shick said, it will take 25 years for the Redevelopment Agency to pay 
off the bonds sold to finance the mall. Only after that will the sales tax 
income from the auto dealers start flowing into the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
While Long Beach suffers from its own set of sales tax problems, cities all 
over the state have experienced a slowdown in the growth of their sales tax 
income, according to Jim Harrington, assistant director for policy development 
at the League of California Cities, a municipal lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
The league just completed a study of municipal finances since Proposition 13, 
which severely limited property tax increases. The organization found that 
sales tax revenue on a per capita basis has been flat over the past decade, 
lagging behind population growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Discretionary Income 
</P>
<P>
"The sales tax dollar doesn't go as far as it used to," Harrington said, 
explaining that increases in housing and other costs have eaten into the 
discretionary income of the middle class, leaving it less money to spend on 
items that are subject to the 6.5% sales tax. Five percent goes to the state, 
1% goes to the city in which the sale was made, and the rest goes to the county 
for transportation funding. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of sales tax growth, combined with cuts in federal and state grants 
and property tax limits, have combined to erode municipal incomes around 
California. When inflation is taken into account, typical city revenue on a per 
capita basis has fallen more than 15%, the league study found. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, cities are having to cut back on services or impose new taxes to 
support local services. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, officials have discussed, but not acted on, asking voters to 
approve property tax increases that would be specifically earmarked for 
expanding recreation and police programs. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to services, Councilman Tom Clark said, "We've had to pretty much 
stay at the same level." 
</P>
<P>
And the shoppers of Long Beach likely will stay in their same patterns, at 
least for the near future. As for Filbey, the housewife on Karen Avenue in east 
Long Beach, she finds downtown Long Beach somewhat scary and thinks it is more 
convenient to shop elsewhere. "I love Long Beach with a passion," she said, 
"but when I go shopping, I'm ashamed to say it's in Lakewood and Cerritos."

<TEXT>
<P>
It was the spring of 1975 when Gladys Jenkins moved into a small, three-bedroom 
home in a quiet neighborhood not far from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
It was the perfect place to retire, Jenkins, then 64, told her children. She 
could spend her afternoons baking bread or relaxing with her friends on the 
porch. And the rent was reasonable: $250 a month. 
</P>
<P>
But Jenkins' dreams have been shattered. She was stricken with Alzheimer's 
disease. And the rent and operating expenses of the little home have become too 
high for her fixed income. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 20, Jenkins and her daughter, who shares the house with her mother so 
she can take care of her, are scheduled to be evicted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fighting for Home 
</P>
<P>
The landlord said they have not paid rent since May. Jenkins' daughter, Faye 
Zamora, said they failed to pay only in June, and that they are being unfairly 
thrown out so the landlord can raise the rent. There has been only one rent 
increase -- to $580 -- since Jenkins moved into the house 14 years ago, Zamora 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Their story has become all too familiar, said Anthony A. Ayala, the coordinator 
of the Norwalk senior citizen center. He said he has seen about 40 similar 
cases in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly people come to him with the same problem: they are being evicted 
because they have fallen behind in their rent. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala said the problem often starts when landlords realize that they could be 
getting more for their rental property. Since elderly people tend to live in 
one place for a long time, the rent increases often do not keep pace with the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a situation where an elderly person may be paying $125 rent for a 
house," Ayala said. "Then, all of a sudden, the landlord raises the rent to 
$425." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rent Increase Has Major Impact 
</P>
<P>
Although $425 a month for rent is still low by Los Angeles standards, such an 
increase can be devastating for an elderly person who has an income of $600 a 
month, Ayala said. 
</P>
<P>
When the elderly person misses a payment, the landlord often has no mercy, 
Ayala said. He evicts the tenant and increases the rent for the next one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not right," Zamora said. She said she receives some money from the 
government for taking care of her mother. They live on about $1,000 a month 
with their incomes combined. They are barely getting by, Zamora said. 
</P>
<P>
Zamora said her mother is only vaguely aware of their difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to shield her from it," Zamora said. "It could be devastating to her 
illness." 
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the problems between her and her landlord, Rick Magdaleno, started 
several months ago when Zamora found her mother's lease. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lease, Zamora said, Magdaleno should have been paying the 
water bills, which Zamora says she's been paying. She said the bills 
mysteriously top $100 some months. Zamora said she is trying to find out why 
the bills are so high. When she asked Magdaleno to reimburse her about $6,000 
for past water bills, Magdaleno became upset, Zamora said. 
</P>
<P>
Magdaleno said during an interview that Zamora is responsible for the water 
bills because of a verbal agreement he made with Zamora's brother, Bill, who 
used to share the house with Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1983 we gave Bill a choice," Magdaleno said. "We told him he could start 
paying for the water bills, or we would have to raise the rent." 
</P>
<P>
Bill chose to pay the water bills, Magdaleno said. 
</P>
<P>
Zamora said she fell behind on the rent payments in June because she had to pay 
a $130 water bill. 
</P>
<P>
After Zamora missed the rent payment, Magdaleno obtained eviction papers. 
Zamora said she tried to pay Magdaleno a portion of the overdue rent, but he 
would not take the payment. 
</P>
<P>
"That shows me he just wants us out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Landlord's Position 
</P>
<P>
Magdaleno said he is tired of looking like the bad guy. His said his father 
died of cancer several years ago, and he needs the rent money to support his 
elderly mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a bank and I'm not a charitable organization," Magdaleno said. "The 
current market value of that house is $950 to $1,100 a month (in rent). They're 
paying $580, about 41% less (than what the house is worth.) We've gone above 
and beyond for them and they still can't pay on time." 
</P>
<P>
Zamora said she plans to fight the eviction in court. 
</P>
<P>
There is a 90% chance the judge will rule in favor of Magdaleno, said Lisa 
Korben, a staff member of the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, a group that 
provides legal support for people fighting evictions. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not going to make exceptions just because this person is old and 
lives on $600 a month," Korben said. Instead, the judge will probably conclude 
that the tenant broke a written, legally binding lease agreement, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiations Sought 
</P>
<P>
Zamora also is trying to get Magdaleno to negotiate with her before Norwalk's 
landlord/tenant board, but Magdaleno says he will not negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Sonnenfeld, the program coordinator for the Norwalk Consumer/Rental 
Negotiation Board, said mediation boards cannot force landlords to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no legal power, Sonnenfeld said. As a result, he said, "the tenants 
fall by the wayside." 
</P>
<P>
Zamora said she has looked for alternate housing but has found nothing they can 
afford. She refuses to place her mother in a nursing home because she believes 
it is her duty to take care of her. 
</P>
<P>
According to Korben, government housing takes six months to a year to obtain. 
Low-rent senior citizen apartments usually have a long waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to endure," Zamora said. "I have a life to look after." 
</P>
<P>
But Zamora said she believes that they will be thrown out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Sonnenfeld said Zamora's and Jenkins' case is a perfect example of how the 
system breaks down for elderly people caught in the trap of high rental prices 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There's very little for us to do," Sonnenfeld said. "There's not enough 
affordable housing. People here live worse than they do in developing 
countries. Where will they go? God only knows."

PROSPECT OF HOTEL IN WESTWOOD VILLAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dori Pye's defense of Nansay Corp.'s proposed Westwood Village hotel (Letter, 
Aug. 20) is confused and unnecessarily divisive. The city made a mistake. The 
Horizons is a hotel under the Municipal Code. Why should the community wind up 
with 650 guest rooms when we agreed to only 350 rooms? Where is the planned 
protection to accommodate an additional hotel the size of the Century City 
Marriott? 
</P>
<P>
There are no heroes or villains in this dispute. A problem exists, and we are 
trying to resolve it, not sweep it under the rug. Calling the Horizons a 
retirement hotel does not make it one legally. Furthermore, the Westwood 
Village Specific Plan prohibits hotels being closer than 500 feet. This means 
that no hotel may be built within 500 feet of the Horizons Hotel. Nansay's 
property is directly across the street from the Horizons -- 75 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Ms. Pye, I believe that homeowner leaders should engage directly in a 
dialogue with developers so that projects can be made to be compatible with the 
community. We seek solutions, not conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Dori Pye's claim that "elected representatives" -- by which she 
presumably means Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky -- are appeasing those who oppose 
the project, here are the facts: He failed to furnish Friends of Westwood with 
a copy of his request for a ruling from the Zoning Administrator, or of any 
subsequent actions that involved deadlines for appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, on the last day possible, an appeal was filed by Holmby Westwood 
Property Owners, Westwood Homeowners, and Friends of Westwood, representing 
approximately 5,000 Westwood residents. It should also be noted that as late as 
March, 1989, he received maximum campaign contributions from both Nansay and 
from the Horizon's owner, David Roberts, and members of his family. 
</P>
<P>
At a Nov. 5, 1987, Westwood Emergency Town Meeting on the Village Plan, a show 
of hands was asked for those favoring any hotel in the village. Out of 300 
people, only two raised their hands in support. Clearly, Westwood's homeowner 
associations and Friends of Westwood have a mandate from the community.

RESPECTFUL THE WORD FOR SAN GABRIEL RACE 
</P>

SAN GABRIEL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lawn signs, advertising homeowners' allegiance to their chosen candidates, 
are up again. The candidates and their supporters are knocking on voters' 
doors. It must be election time in San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
But wait. There's something missing. Unlike the last bitterly fought City 
Council election in April, 1988, and the two most recent special elections, 
there has been a jarring absence of vitriol. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Cammarano and Norm Stabeck, competing in a Sept. 12 election for the 
council seat vacated when Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak was successfully recalled 
in May, have been downright respectful of each other. In fact, the most hotly 
fought issue of the campaign so far has been the candidates' respective 
experience and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
"We've agreed that we want to keep it issue-oriented," said Richard Valverde, 
Stabeck's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insults Traded 
</P>
<P>
"You'd hardly know there was an election going on," added Stabeck. "When you go 
out knocking on doors, people are saying: 'What? We have to go through this 
again? We just went through one.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the last council election, in which a slate of three slow-growth candidates 
swept three incumbents out of office, competing sides called each other 
"radical extremists" and "major developers." In the May recall election, 
Blaszcak was voted out of office amid charges that he offered to sell drugs to 
a Santa Ana police officer, charges that are now the subject of a libel suit. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of San Gabriel don't deserve what's happened in the past," said 
Cammarano, referring to recent mud-slinging campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some disdain for each other's qualifications, Cammarano and Stabeck 
have stayed low-key. At times, they sound remarkably alike. Both support open 
government and restraints on some forms of development. And both are urging 
that the faction-racked council stick to city business. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is approving a new General Plan for the city, which has 
operated under a voter-approved moratorium on development for 20 months. The 
moratorium is scheduled to be lifted in December. 
</P>
<P>
Cammarano, office manager for Local 923 of the Cement Masons Union, moved to 
San Gabriel from Buffalo, N.Y., 25 years ago. This is her first run for office, 
but she has been involved in volunteer organizations since she arrived in the 
city, starting with the PTA. All five of her children are grown. 
</P>
<P>
She is president of the American Field Service, volunteer chairman for the 
local chapter of the American Red Cross and a board member for the San Gabriel 
Historical Assn. And she has been attending City Council meetings for 22 years, 
always ready to speak out from the perspective of longtime San Gabriel 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Cammarano supported Blaszcak's recall, publicly crossing swords with the 
controversial vice mayor about, among other things, his purchase of a portable 
telephone at city expense. 
</P>
<P>
There are no radical differences between herself and Stabeck, Cammarano said, 
except in their respective lengths of service to San Gabriel. "I've been in 
town 25 years; he's been here three years," she said. "That's important." 
(Actually, Stabeck has been a resident for seven years, three at his current 
address in the northern part of the city.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not for Slow Growth 
</P>
<P>
Despite being a former member of Citizens for Responsible Development, 
Cammarano is not a slow-growth proponent, she insists. She favors "quality 
development," though she wants to see more restrictions on oversized houses on 
small lots. "With some of the homes they're building, you have to look twice to 
see if they're really single-family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She also favors voluntary recycling and synchronizing traffic lights to improve 
traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
Stabeck, a financial analyst with the Orange County Transit District, also 
stresses his experience: 15 years of "professional experience in local 
government." He has been a member of the city Planning Commission since the 
beginning of 1988. He has worked for the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments as a transportation planner, as well as for the city of Glendale as 
a planner. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission has been unusually effective during his tenure, Stabeck 
said. The commission has produced a new city sign ordinance and a design review 
committee, and it has helped draft the new General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
But the city is at a turning point, Stabeck said. Because of its location 
"between residential communities to the east and employment centers in downtown 
Los Angeles," he said, San Gabriel is having difficulty controlling its own 
destiny. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tremendous Pressure' 
</P>
<P>
"With increasing land values, there's tremendous pressure to increase the 
apartment and condo supply, because developers can sell them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stabeck vowed that, if elected, he will seek to maintain the city's small-town 
character through new land-use ordinances and zoning codes and through 
vigilance on the City Council, which is the court of last resort on zoning 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Stabeck said the new General Plan and zoning ordinances will improve the 
quality of life in the city, but he added: "If you assume the problems are 
solved, they'll come back." 
</P>
<P>
Stabeck, who has been endorsed by Citizens for Responsible Development, 
supported Blaszcak in his unsuccessful campaign to keep his seat. "But from my 
point of view, the recall was one event and (the election) is another event," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Long Learning Curve' 
</P>
<P>
Stabeck suggested that Cammarano, because of her lack of experience in city 
government, is not up to the task of protecting the city from developers. 
"She's going to have a long learning curve," said Stabeck. "I've spent a lot of 
time in graduate school, working in government and serving on the Planning 
Commission. There's a hell of a lot to learn." 
</P>
<P>
He also said Cammarano's job with a construction union has kept her from 
supporting slow-growth positions. "If she's willing to take directions from the 
union on something as important as that, what will she do in office?" Stabeck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cammarano denies that she has taken orders from the union. "I was never a 
slow-growther," she said. She recognized Stabeck's extensive education but 
suggested that she is more attuned to the voters. "That's fine," she said of 
Stabeck's record. "But I've been here 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
Stabeck proposes a program that would protect neighborhoods of single-family 
homes from new construction of multifamily units, require developers to pay for 
increased city services needed for new projects and add park space.

WEST HOLLYWOOD RENT FEE INCREASE IS BLOCKED; 
</P>
<P>
LANDLORDS WIN RESTRAINING ORDER ON CITY'S DOUBLING OF REGISTRATION CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SPENCER S. HSU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unexpected legal action, West Hollywood's largest landlord group this 
week obtained a temporary restraining order blocking the city from collecting 
$900,000 from landlords by doubling a fee used to fund its Rent Stabilization 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood Concerned Citizens, which represents about 1,000 landlords 
citywide, argued in Santa Monica Superior Court on Wednesday that the city 
violated its own Municipal Code when it approved a rental registration fee 
increase July 17, and that the increase infringes upon landlords' rights to a 
fair economic return on their investments, a basic principle of state rent 
control law. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Weisberg issued the order and set 
a court hearing date for Sept. 13. West Hollywood, complying with the court 
order, ceased accepting landlords' payments of the fee increase Thursday, but 
is not required to return payments made before that time. 
</P>
<P>
Grafton Tanquary, leader of the landlord group, accused the city of ignoring 
landlords' concerns over this issue and called the fee increase "illegal and 
grossly unfair." 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk to people and you say, 'Listen, we're opposed to this, we don't 
think it's fair, or honest, or legal,' and they ignore you, what are we going 
to do?" Tanquary said. "Our only recourse is to the courts." 
</P>
<P>
City officials dismissed the landlords' suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that all the arguments totally lack merit," said Assistant City Atty. 
Carol M. Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
The landlords' attorney, Craig Mordoh of Santa Monica, "totally misunderstood 
the ordinances that were adopted," Lynch said, adding that she was surprised 
and disappointed that the issue had gone to court. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute stems from West Hollywood's decision in July to double an annual 
rent registration fee from $48 to $96 per unit. Since the city's rent control 
law was passed in 1985, the $48 fee has been assessed each September to 
landlords, who then could pass the expense to renters at $4 per month. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, the city will still bill landlords for the entire fee but 
prohibits the additional $48 from being passed to tenants in the city's 18,000 
rental units. 
</P>
<P>
City officials authorized the fee hike to fund the Rent Stabilization 
Department, which last year relied on the city's general fund for 51% of its 
budget.

COMPROMISE TO SAVE SENNETT SOUND STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's not much left these days on the site of the former Mack Sennett Studios 
in Echo Park -- just a hulking shell of a sound stage and perhaps the ghosts of 
the studios' most famous characters, Charlie Chaplin and the Keystone Kops. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the ground where Chaplin perfected his famous walk is being graded 
for building foundations, and the glamour of early movie making is gone, 
replaced by an orange-and-white storage company sign and the sounds of cranes 
and carpenters at work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transformation Under Way 
</P>
<P>
The crumbling complex, one-time headquarters of Hollywood's early comedy stars, 
is fast being transformed by its owner, Public Storage Inc., into a storage 
facility. The only building left on the site -- the first permanent concrete 
reinforced movie sound stage built on the West Coast -- will be preserved as 
part of an agreement worked out early this year between the company and the Los 
Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Public Storage bought the dilapidated studio site at 1712 Glendale Blvd. two 
years ago and planned to raze the remaining 35,000-square-foot building there 
and replace it with the orange-and-white, boxlike buildings for which the 
company is known. 
</P>
<P>
But preservationists were enraged by the company's plan. They appealed to the 
Cultural Heritage Commission to prevent demolition of the former sound stage, 
which had been declared a cultural-historic landmark by the city in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The designation can delay but not prevent demolition of buildings. Eventually, 
Public Storage agreed to preserve the former sound stage and build two 
additional storage buildings next to it. 
</P>
<P>
Public Storage spokesmen said the company plans to convert the former sound 
stage into a warehouse, renovate its exterior and set up a display of 
photographs documenting the building's history. 
</P>
<P>
Film historians and several preservation-oriented groups, among them the Los 
Angeles Conservancy and Hollywood Heritage, are relieved that the building will 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes it adequate for all of us, what makes us happy, is that they're not 
going to tear the building down and they're going to use it," said Marc 
Wanamaker, a film buff who is writing a book on the histories of Hollywood 
studios. "I would love to see it alive as a movie studio again, but Hollywood 
has moved away from that area. I'm afraid this is the best we can hope for." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$2-Million Investment 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hendrickson, a Public Storage spokesman, said the Glendale-based company 
is investing $2 million in the two-acre site. He said the new buildings on the 
site will be partially faced with glass and are designed to be reminiscent of 
the studio buildings once there. 
</P>
<P>
The site, a former horse ranch, was purchased in 1909 by New York Motion 
Picture Co., which owned Keystone Film Co. and Bison Film Co., which made 
Western films. During its early years, the lot was used mainly for cowboy 
movies, and the structures built there, like most in Los Angeles, were made of 
wood and torn down after each shoot. 
</P>
<P>
But when director Mack Sennett bought the site in 1916, he built several 
permanent sound stage buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"This company built a permanent stage, establishing the beginnings of a 
permanent film industry in Los Angeles," Wanamaker said. "There's not much left 
from the early days, just a handful of places. It's really important that it 
remain because of what it meant for L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Under Sennett's direction, the studio became home to movie greats Chaplin, 
Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle, Mabel Normand and Ford Sterling. But the site has not 
housed a bona fide movie studio since 1916, when Sennett relocated in Studio 
City. 
</P>

Later, the facility was a roller-skating rink, a window frame factory and a 
theater group's headquarters. Its last tenant moved out in 1982 and since then, 
the site has become an eyesore, its ground thick with weeds and its buildings 
defaced by graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Public Storage officials said they expect to complete work on the site in 
April. They said that when they do, the land will look better than it has for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists and city officials are reserving judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"Public Storage is not famous for beautiful architecture," said Jay Oren, staff 
architect of the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs. "What they are 
famous for is large, ugly orange signs. But we just didn't want to lose that 
building. Period."

DOCTOR'S FREE TESTS A CRUCIAL WEAPON IN FIGHT AGAINST AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SPENCER S. HSU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day in 1987, Stephen J. Gabin sat in his Century City medical office and 
settled an internal battle he had been fighting for seven years. By testing 
himself for the AIDS virus, the physician, 42, put an end to the fear he had 
carried from the time he treated his first HIV-infected patient in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Gabin, a leading Los Angeles AIDS expert with one of the region's largest AIDS 
practices, turned his doubt into a personal crusade for early testing for the 
disease, a crusade that began well before two recent medical reports confirmed 
the case for early testing for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
On July 1, Gabin decided to provide free, anonymous testing for the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Director of Century City Hospital's 
AIDS-care unit, Gabin expected his two-month progrm to administer more than 800 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
Experts note that the figure is more than double the number tested at an 
average county-contracted testing site over the same period. More important, 
they applaud his effort as a signal to doctors and patients that the battle 
against AIDS will be a long and difficult one, and that testing and education 
remain the most effective means of fighting the disease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overcome Denial 
</P>
<P>
"The barriers are that people have denial and the physicians have denial, and 
that's what his message is trying to overcome," said Dr. Neil Schram, member of 
the Los Angeles County Medical Assn.'s AIDS Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"He not only is encouraging people to think about getting tested, but he is 
encouraging people to discuss getting tested with their physicians." 
</P>
<P>
"I was very concerned," said Gabin, "that people didn't fully realize that the 
idea of testing made more sense than it did a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Raised in Philadelphia, Gabin began in medicine as a general practitioner in 
Orange County 15 years ago. In 1977, he began to specialize in treating gay 
men, who now make up 95% of his practice, including 700 to 800 infected with 
HIV. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make a strong commitment both to my patients and the community at 
large that people who might have been exposed to HIV should be tested." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employs Publicist 
</P>
<P>
Gabin, who employs a publicist, also acknowledges that he makes "a good living" 
at his practice and that his free program has added to it, but he said his 
intent was simply to fight AIDS with every means at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor's program ended just as the nation's largest AIDS advocate groups 
have endorsed voluntary and confidential testing as the best way to take 
advantage of new drugs found to delay the onset of AIDS symptoms, findings 
released in recent reports. 
</P>
<P>
Gabin said the size of response to his offer, about 400 per month, indicated 
that some people prefer a private setting to government-sponsored clinics for 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, only about 1,100 to 1,200 HIV antibody tests are administered by 
all seven county-contracted locations each month on average, said John 
Schunhoff, assistant director of the AIDS program office with the Los Angeles 
County Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
About 15% of the participants in Gabin's program have tested positive, similar 
to the 14.4% infection rate for county test sites. 
</P>
<P>
"The message that could be interpeted by other doctors is that AIDS is such an 
important disease that as physicians we should do everything possible, 
including paying for the tests if that's what it takes, to get those patients 
who have engaged in risky behavior in the past to be tested," said Dr. David 
Dassey, deputy medical director of the AIDS program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Seeking U.S. Funds 
</P>
<P>
Citing a state report, Schram said that as many as 250,000 to 300,000 
Californians may be infected with HIV, with up to one-third of those living in 
the Los Angeles area. A substantial majority has not been tested. 
</P>
<P>
Gabin is considering pressing for government funds to subsidize private 
physician AIDS testing, he said, but public health experts say that more 
important is the message sent to other doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"From my perspective, one of the big problems in getting people tested is that 
gay men and (intravenous) drug users are afraid to share that information with 
their physicians because they are afraid their physicians will reject them -- 
and in too many instances that is a valid concern," said Schram, an internist 
and former member of the Los Angeles City Task Force on AIDS. Gay and bisexual 
men, intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs face the greatest risk of 
infection, as do sexual partners of people in these high-risk groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Most doctors don't like talking about sex and they don't like talking about 
illegal drugs, (but) you have to take that step. If you can take that first 
step, then you can see risky behavior and then you can say, 'Be tested,' " 
Dassey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ground Floor of Treatment 
</P>
<P>
Gabin attributed his own efforts to being gay himself. He began working on gay 
issues when friends and relatives told him that their doctors ignored problems 
often confronting gay males. 
</P>
<P>
His focus brought him in on the ground floor of AIDS treatment, and Gabin has 
devoted successively more time to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"My patient population since about 1977 has been largely made up of gay men, 
and so I found myself in a situation where we were seeing a new disease process 
in front of our eyes. We didn't have any choice but to learn about it," Gabin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gabin declined to comment on the cost of his program, but Schunhoff of the 
health department said the county is reimbursed by the state $44 per test to 
pay for lab and personnel costs. According to figures quoted by Schunhoff, 
testing for 800 people alone could cost about $3,600. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of similarities between fighting AIDS and fighting a war," 
Gabin said, "and when lives are on the line, it's hard to be anything but 100% 
committed.

<P>
Alexei Belov, the blond lead guitarist for the Soviet rock group Gorky Park, 
got up early enough on his first morning home in months to make the 45-minute 
drive from his parents' apartment to Lenin Stadium by 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Belov, who speaks English well, seemed a bit self-conscious when he found 
himself almost alone in the huge, 100,000-capacity stadium, which was built in 
1955 and upgraded for the 1980 Olympics. The first sound check for the Moscow 
Music Peace Festival wasn't scheduled for another four hours. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his early arrival, the somewhat shy, 31-year-old musician 
mentioned something about wanting to make sure that the band's equipment had 
arrived safely from the United States, where Gorky Park had spent the last 
several months recording an album that was just released by PolyGram Records. 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes, however, it became clear that the real reason Belov had 
come early to the stadium was that he wanted to savor every minute of what he 
felt was an historic weekend. 
</P>
<P>
To Belov, the festival -- starring Bon Jovi, Ozzy Osbourne and other rockers in 
the most ambitious display of Western hard-rock ever staged in the Soviet Union 
-- was more than just the East/West cultural breakthrough that was being hailed 
in the media. It was the most graphic and emotional sign yet of change in his 
country: a change that had helped renew his long submerged rock 'n' roll 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Belov's story offers a compact guide to the obscure workings of Russian rock. 
For years, Belov was a "forbidden" musician here, unable to perform on radio, 
television or on records -- not because of anything politically subversive in 
the lyrics of his old band, he said, but because the group, Moscow, was causing 
its young fans to become too excited. 
</P>
<P>
"That band was a very exciting time for us," said Belov, whose long black coat, 
black shirt and black pants gave him a stark, aristocratic aura. "I had been in 
other bands, but they were 'approved' pop bands . . . not really the music I 
loved. 
</P>
<P>
"Moscow was a band that played music like we heard from the West. And it was 
wonderful to have the audience screaming and excited, but the officials said it 
was too wild . . . too passionate and we had to stop. I think they thought it 
was too Western . . . thus anti-Communist." 
</P>
<P>
Heartbroken and frustrated, Belov was forced for the next few years to play 
"wild clubs" -- the Soviet equivalent of the "buckets of blood" dives in the 
United States. They were clubs where people come more to fight and drink than 
to hear music -- places that authorities apparently didn't take time to 
monitor. 
</P>
<P>
Finally unable to take the violent environment, Belov turned his back on rock 
'n' roll. He put down his guitar and began working in recording studios, 
helping other bands on arrangements and concepts. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Gorbachev and perestroika and glasnost, and Belov thought again about 
making music. Just as things started loosening up in other areas of Soviet 
life, musicians were given more freedom and, eventually, allowed access to the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
The band Gorky Park was pieced together by Stas Namin, an early Russian rock 
performer and the grandson of a former chairman of the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium. Thanks to some contacts he had made in the West, Namin got Gorky 
Park a U.S. recording contract with PolyGram and helped put together the Moscow 
Music Peace Festival where the band and two other Namin-connected Soviet groups 
shared the bill with five Western entries: Bon Jovi, Osbourne, Motley Crue, the 
Scorpions and Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
After the years of disillusionment and doubt, Belov seemed awed by the dramatic 
changes in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the field in the vast, empty stadium, he said, "This is 
unbelievable. This is a place for the Olympics . . . for soccer. Who ever 
thought there would also be rock 'n' roll here? 
</P>
<P>
"We played in Leningrad with the Scorpions last year, but they wouldn't allow 
the show in Moscow. Officials were scared. They thought something bad might 
happen if this many young people got together. Now, they realize that things 
must change . . . that you can't deny people things that are important to them, 
like music, forever. I'm just glad it came in time for me." 
</P>
<P>
Alexley (Kozlov), Andrei (Makarevich), Stas (Namin) and Alexander (Gradsky) are 
some of the famous first names from the early days of Russian rock, but the 
most important rock names to Russian fans have always been John, Paul, George 
and Ringo. 
</P>
<P>
Like their counterparts around the world, Soviet teen-agers were caught up in 
the fresh, exuberant sounds of the Beatles in the '60s. They tried their best, 
within the limits of available clothing and social pressure, to look like the 
Fab Four, and they cherished tapes or records smuggled into the country by 
friends and soldiers after visits to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Stas Namin, grandson of Anastas Mikoyan, Presidium chairman in 1964 and 1965, 
was among those enthralled with the sounds of records like "A Hard Day's Night" 
and "I Want to Hold Your Hand." 
</P>
<P>
"I heard them on tapes and on the radio and I immediately wanted to play the 
guitar," said Namin, who operates a recording studio and stages concerts at his 
own theater in Gorky Park, an area of Moscow described as roughly the 
equivalent of Griffith Park in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Namin, who also speaks English, formed his first group in 1965 and became part 
of the first wave of rock in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
"The music was officially 'forbidden' because it was thought of as rebellious," 
he said, sitting in a production office at Lenin Stadium on the morning of the 
first day of the festival. "They thought it would drive the young people too 
wild and make them (identify) too strongly with the West. 
</P>
<P>
"But you could still play it in little clubs . . . underground rooms. We 
weren't (frustrated) because it was impossible to imagine that rock 'n' roll 
would ever be official in this country. We didn't think about ever playing in 
the U.S. or Britain or have those bands come here because we didn't think 
(personally) about going to Venus or Mars either. It was just a different 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Namin, who is now in his early 40s, built a considerable following, moving back 
and forth between the two categories in the country's complicated -- and now 
apparently less pervasive -- system of "amateur bands" and "professional 
bands." 
</P>
<P>
In his book "Back in the USSR," Artemy Troitsky describes the difference 
between the two kinds of groups. Members of the "amateur" groups are not 
allowed (officially, at least) to earn money. They are expected to have regular 
day jobs and receive no state support, and in turn don't have to deal with 
official cultural agencies. 
</P>
<P>
With "professionals," music is their main job. They belong to an official, 
state-affiliated concert organization that books shows for them throughout the 
Soviet Union. The group must present itself to an artistic council for 
approval. This council can cancel an act's approved status, thus rendering the 
band "forbidden." 
</P>
<P>
Professionals, Troitsky writes, enjoy several advantages, including wages, the 
opportunity to tour and play large venues, free musical equipment and the right 
to appear on radio, TV and records. The amateur groups have just one advantage: 
greater freedom in expressing themselves. Authorities, Namin said, didn't seem 
to worry about the latter groups because their shows were fairly underground, 
restricted to small rooms rather than large halls. 
</P>
<P>
Like Belov, Namin was eventually declared "forbidden" after forming a band, 
Flowers, that also seemed to stir too many Western-style passions. Besides, 
Namin said, the cultural officials thought the group's name was too closely 
identified with drugs and American flower-power sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
But Namin -- under the name Stas Namin Group -- continued to perform and by the 
'80s was granted "approved" status again. Soon after the arrival of glasnost, 
Namin accepted an invitation to do some shows in the U.S. and, later, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
He returned home and began building a music organization that manages bands and 
sponsors concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Namin works with some 40 bands, representing styles ranging from new wave and 
hard rock to jazz-rock. He said he chose Belov's group, Gorky Park, to promote 
first in the West because he thinks the first "Soviet super group" -- as he 
terms it -- should be "a positive band with classic rock overtones, strong 
masculine voices and vibrations of the land." 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, he has many bands of equal quality in the wings. "Gorky Park is 
just the beginning," he said. "You will be hearing a lot in the '90s from our 
bands." 
</P>
<P>
Belov was born in the center of Moscow, right behind the Pushkin Museum of Fine 
Arts. He remembers hearing his parents' recordings by Bill Haley and other '50s 
stars of rock as a child, but it was the Beatles who first made him want to be 
a musician. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't understand any of the words, but I didn't care," he said, sitting 
with the four other members of the band in a stadium dressing room the day 
before the festival. "I just loved the sound. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing is we had no idea that they were popular all around the world. 
We just loved the music. All of a sudden, a lot of people my age were playing 
guitars. We all wanted to be the Beatles. I saved some money and bought an 
acoustic guitar and taught myself how to play." 
</P>
<P>
While attending architecture college, Belov played in amateur bands, performing 
original tunes and versions of songs by such groups as Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin 
and Deep Purple. 
</P>
<P>
The records by these bands weren't sold in the state shops because the 
government frowned on rock and because the state label, Melodiya, wasn't 
willing to pay royalties to the Western artists. Still, he said, it was easy to 
acquire them through friends who traveled to the West and in "unofficial" stops 
that were apparently allowed to operate on a sort of black market basis by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a promising future in architecture, Belov opted for music -- even 
though he realized that in Russia he would probably never be able to enjoy 
either the financial or artistic rewards rockers in the West received. 
</P>
<P>
Belov joined a "professional" band when he was 18, earning the equivalent of 
$100 to $200 a month -- roughly the average salary in the Soviet Union at the 
time. Though the first group sometimes played before crowds as large as 15,000 
to 30,000, Belov eventually became frustrated because the music was more 
pop-oriented than the rock he loved. 
</P>
<P>
The group, Belov said, played each night from a list of songs filed with the 
state cultural committee. Though tempted, the band never tried to sneak in 
other favorites because there was always the fear that "someone could be around 
and you could be suddenly stopped one day and not allowed to play any more." 
</P>
<P>
The guitarist then formed Moscow, a band that leaned more toward rock. He was 
thrilled -- until the band got so popular that the government closed it down. 
Recalling the period, he said, "When they declared us 'forbidden,' I felt like 
I had almost been killed . . . that I was dying." 
</P>
<P>
Belov had offers to play in several pop-oriented, state-sponsored bands, but he 
described them as "very, polite, very safe, very boring." He opted for the 
nerve-wracking "wild clubs" until he was drained. 
</P>
<P>
The road to Gorky Park began when Namin returned from performing in the U.S. 
and began assembling his new band, which also includes singer Nikolai Noskov, 
bassist Sasha Minkov, drummer Sasha Lvov and guitarist Jan Ianenkov. With their 
previous groups, the musicians had collectively sold more than 10 million 
albums in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Able to operate outside of the old "approved/forbidden" system, Belov declares 
the band as absolutely independent. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in this band is like being reborn," he said. "We were playing real rock 
'n' roll again, and kids liked it very much. We played festivals for 25,000 
people almost immediately and then we began thinking about America." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge to America and PolyGram Records came through Namin's link with New 
Jersey-based manager Dennis Berardi. With the help of a good word from Bon Jovi 
guitarist Richie Sambora, a long-time friend of Berardi, Gorky Park got signed 
by PolyGram Records. The group, which is expected to tour here late this year, 
is already getting exposure on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize the Russian thing is going to get the band a lot of attention in 
the beginning, but that only lasts for a couple of weeks," Berardi said 
backstage at Lenin Stadium. "After that, the band will have to prove itself." 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Music Peace Festival, which was given extensive coverage by MTV and 
was shown on a pay-per-view basis in the United States, was Gorky Park's first 
big chance to state its case -- at least electronically -- to a Western 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Western acts, especially Ozzy Osbourne, drew the most cheers, the 
Soviet bands, too, were warmly received. Dozens of fans waved Soviet flags as 
Gorky Park went through some of its own songs in English and topped its 
50-minute set both days with a version of the Who's "My Generation." 
</P>
<P>
But the group's performance was shaky during the first day of the festival. 
Though the music has some bite on record, it seemed rather dated live -- much 
like a replay of the "corporate rock" sound of such '70s best-sellers as 
Journey. 
</P>
<P>
Lead singer Noskov didn't help by wearing lace pants that made him look more 
like Lita Ford than a rock hero. Things were sharper musically the second day, 
but the band's movements still seemed stiff and a bit old-fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
Belov acknowledged before going on stage here that most Russian bands are way 
behind the times, but he feels that greater exposure to the Western rock world 
will help the groups update their presentations. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere at the festival was loose and relaxed, much the way the city 
itself seemed. Visiting here 10 years ago, a reporter was struck by the way 
people on the street seemed uncomfortable when approached, and especially when 
an interview was attempted. 
</P>
<P>
But now they tended to speak much more generously, seeming even eager to 
express their feelings to visiting reporters about the changes in their country 
and the changes they feel are still needed. 
</P>
<P>
Both Western and local participants in the concert -- including Bon Jovi 
manager Doc McGhee and Stas Namin -- spoke of the festival as a sort of Soviet 
Woodstock. But fans, too, spoke in terms of a cultural breakthrough. Some in 
the crowd had traveled as long as four days by train from Siberia to be on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest prizes of the day were concert T-shirts, which were sold from the 
back of two giant trucks just inside the stadium's outer gates. The festival 
sponsors had flown in 30,000 T-shirts and they were reportedly all sold 
(despite a fairly hefty $40 price tag) within 90 minutes. Fans lined up 10 and 
12 deep the entire time at the rear of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm wasn't all out of love for rock 'n' roll, pointed out one local 
resident, who said he runs a one-man black market operation. He said the 
T-shirts -- like the much-publicized Paul McCartney album of oldies that was 
released only in the Soviet Union -- are like currency. The man, who appeared 
to be in his early 20s, said he somehow got 1,000 of the McCartney albums 
straight from the factory and now trades to Soviet citizens or sells them to 
tourists for much valued U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
After Gorky Park's set, Belov and the other members of the band walked out 
among the crowd. This was no time to stay isolated in the dressing room. Just 
as he had been moved by the empty stadium a few days before, he again seemed 
moved by seeing it filled with rock fans. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, people here thought about the day when things would be better, but 
finally it got to a point where they no longer believed it," he said during the 
festival weekend. "I think Gorbachev realized there was no way we could live 
like that any more. It was time to give people more freedom and, for me and all 
the people here, part of that freedom was rock 'n' roll."

A THEATER WHERE THE ACTOR COMES FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN

<TEXT>
<P>
It's too bad that Joe Stern refuses to read Simon Gray's book about his 
experiences trying out "The Common Pursuit" at the Matrix Theater (see Barbara 
Isenberg's adjoining article). If he ever softens, he'll discover that Gray 
found him a lovable man and a patient producer. 
</P>
<P>
Patient???? I only hear from Stern when he's upset about something -- a dumb 
review, some crazy new stunt from Actors' Equity. He's not too patient then. 
But under the surface noise you hear a serious concern for the theater. Not 
just his theater, but everybody's. 
</P>
<P>
Gray criticizes Stern for spending too much tryout time on actors who obviously 
weren't going to be cast in this play, or perhaps any play. That's because 
Stern understands the agony actors go through at auditions, having been one 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
What does he call his organization? "Actors for Themselves." The record hasn't 
been that altruistic, but the title shows Stern's priorities. The guy just 
loves actors. Even better, he believes in them. 
</P>
<P>
That's rare these days. Everybody gives lip service to the idea that the actor 
is as central to the theater as the priest is to the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
But in an industry town -- a town where 300 people will show up for the 
lowliest Equity Waiver tryout -- it's easy to take actors for granted. It's 
easy to start to look at the town's talent pool in the patronizing way of a New 
England textile mill owner regarding his town's labor pool -- endlessly 
available, instantly replaceable. What's really admired, in this philosophy, is 
a strong foreman -- i.e., director. 
</P>
<P>
That has never been the philosophy at the Matrix. Stern does hire strong 
directors, as with his current twin bill, "Wenceslas Square" (staged by Lee 
Shallat) and "A Man With Connections" (Kristoffer Siegel-Tabori). Sam Weisman 
and Norman Rene are other names that come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
But the director at Stern's shop is there to help the actors locate their 
performances, not to turn them into agents of his concept. Gray pokes fun at 
the Method-y stuff that went on at Weisman's "Common Pursuit" rehearsals, the 
emphasis on breaking down the script into beats and "finding the pain" of each 
character, and maybe the jargon does look a little silly. 
</P>
<P>
But the reader recognizes a director who can talk the actor's language and who 
respects his need to know what is going on underneath the lines. The process 
may not be as invigorating as when the actors simply stand the play up and have 
a bash at it, London fashion. But it's the way that plays get rehearsed over 
here, in the better houses, and the results at the Matrix weren't half bad, 
even in Gray's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
The Matrix is definitely one of our better houses. Stern's priorities sometimes 
lead him to take on a script that "acts" like crazy but doesn't add up to a 
hill of beans, "Orphans" being the best example. 
</P>
<P>
But in general one goes to the Matrix confident that the script will be 
intelligent; that the company will be well chosen and well rehearsed (Stern 
doesn't just love actors, he knows actors); that the production will be 
handsomely designed and precisely lit, and that the amenities will be observed. 
</P>
<P>
The program for "The Common Pursuit," for example, was printed on good paper in 
a chaste red-and-black typeface. The reference was to the literary quarterly 
that figured in Gray's plot. It was a touch of class that most local 
small-theater producers would have rejected as too expensive, if it had 
occurred to them at all. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, the Matrix has stood for fine acting, minutely observed. Crisp 
acting, too. They may go for "the pain" in rehearsal at the Matrix, but the 
performances are very much on the line. Stern likes actors who have a top story 
and a bottom story, who don't see a contradiction between feelings and 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
The results can be very rich, as with Nancy Lenehan's current performance in 
"Wenceslas Square." Lenehan plays three women, each with a different answer to 
the question: How is it possible to live an acceptable life in a country 
(Czechoslovakia) that has had its tongue cut out? 
</P>
<P>
The first woman's answer is to be cautious. The second woman's answer is to be 
gruff and scornful. The third woman's answer is to be gay. Lenehan understands 
each answer and also understands that no human being is all of a piece. The 
timid one can laugh with delight. The flirtatious one can be thoughtful. All in 
all, Lenehan is really playing about nine people here, as simply as if she were 
playing one. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful stuff. But we've had dozens of fine performances at the Matrix. There 
was Helen Verbit in "Table Settings," a Jewish mother who wasn't going to let 
anybody treat her like a stereotype, especially not her family. There was Ian 
McShane in "Inadmissible Evidence," a burned-out case careening to disaster, 
the only thing that would save his hide. 
</P>
<P>
There were McShane, Lawrence Pressman and Penny Fuller in Pinter's "Betrayal." 
They betrayed nothing, and said it all. There was also Michael Alaimo in the 
tiny role of a waiter in an Italian restaurant. Without taking the focus away 
from the main story, he had a story of his own, relating to pride of service -- 
the pleasure that a person can take in providing world-class service, even when 
his patrons don't notice it. Joe Stern runs on the same juice.

THE LIFE AND TIMES OF KFAC; 
</P>
<P>
SOME THOUGHTS ON THE DEMISE OF A 'CLASSICAL' RADIO STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KFAC is all but dead. In a couple of weeks, there will be no commercial radio 
station in Los Angeles devoted to serious if you must, call it classical -- 
music. 
</P>
<P>
It is an embarrassment, a disaster, a cause for communal shame and outrage. It 
also is, we fear, an unsettling sign of the times. 
</P>
<P>
These, in case you hadn't noticed, are the times when airlines must sponsor 
symphony concerts, when orchestras go a-begging and then go bankrupt. These are 
the times when the government decreases its support of the arts and, 
simultaneously, removes tax incentives that used to encourage private subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
These are the times when music education disappears from school curricula. 
These are the times when politicians think it is their job to censor art and 
censure artists. 
</P>
<P>
These are bad times. The Philistines are winning. Greed is triumphing. Our 
elected leaders, ever gentler and ever kinder, are looking the other way. 
</P>
<P>
For all its cultural achievement (which is considerable) and for all its 
cultural pretension (which is enormous), Los Angeles has once again succumbed 
to backwoods standards and boondock sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The situation at KFAC is just one small symptom of a large malaise. But it is 
revealing. 
</P>
<P>
First the powers-that-be took away the AM outlet, blithely assuming that all 
people who wanted a little Mozart in their home or car owned an FM set. That 
was bad enough. Now this. 
</P>
<P>
Rock, pop and schlock make money. That's the basic reasoning. Ergo, we need 
more rock, pop and schlock. The stuff will, no doubt, improve our society. So 
much for the virtues of deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
To hell with Beethoven, Brahms and Schoenberg, say our self-appointed guardians 
of sonic virtue. Who needs the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts? Who needs 
effete-elitist diversion? 
</P>
<P>
If you really want that sound, that brand of entertainment -- hey, no problem. 
Eat cake. Buy a CD. Buy a ticket for a live performance. If desperate, turn the 
knob to a more esoteric, less accessible station -- if you can. 
</P>
<P>
Stop. Who thinks of Beethoven as a sound, anyway? What sort of mind regards 
Brahms as mere entertainment? The answers boggle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
But wait. Some unpleasant, stubbornly contrary questions keep nagging our 
righteous, mournful wrath. 
</P>
<P>
Was KFAC as good as it should have been? Would the station have gone under with 
barely a whimper if it had been better? Why did it so seldom achieve the 
sophistication of comparable enterprises in Boston, New York and -- dare we say 
it? -- San Francisco? 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it. KFAC had high-brow aspirations that were often compromised, if 
not contradicted, by low-brow attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
In the good old days -- or were they the bad old days? -- one had to contend 
with certain announcers who might easily be confused with revivalist 
missionaries. The tone was unctuous, the inflection pompous. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the days when the station thought nothing of fragmenting symphonies. 
Those were the days when ears could be jolted with a jingly pitch for a 
hemorrhoid medication before the magic of a Mahler cadence even began to fade. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the new regime, and many of the same irks lingered. Interviews with 
musicians resembled hype orgies in mutual admiration societies. The new breed 
of announcers sounded less like undertakers, perhaps, but more like 
over-the-back-fence chit-chat virtuosos. 
</P>
<P>
The talk tended toward the inane, just as the programming tended toward the 
incoherent. Proper pronunciation of foreign names and titles was very much a 
sometime thing. We recall, with bemusement, the flustered female voice that 
came to repeated grief over the airwaves when confronting the name Monostatos 
in "The Magic Flute" and even mangled Sarastro. Then there was the imported 
expert, since departed, who distorted all French and Italian words with the 
same aberrant British mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
The station tried to do good deeds. This meant turning shrill shill for 
endless, endlessly obnoxious, ultimately fatuous marathons intended to increase 
the subscription fortunes of various local arts groups. This meant gushing over 
any local performance and/or performer within earshot of a presumably gullible 
public. 
</P>
<P>
KFAC was promo heaven, a musical flack's paradise. It insulted no one's 
stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
The philosophy seems to have been simple. If something made music, happened 
here and was "classical," it had to be great. 
</P>
<P>
Great. Great! GREAT! 
</P>
<P>
This was the message. Get out there and defend our music, right or wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, wrong was hardly ever acknowledged. If KFAC harbored critical 
standards, they were kept pretty much a secret. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind. Forget all that. It is too late. 
</P>
<P>
We 'll miss the station. For all its blemishes, it filled a fundamental need. 
It couldn't ruin the music on the records. It played happy host to music that 
doesn't automatically bump and grind. It was a comforting, sometimes even 
uplifting presence on the dial. 
</P>
<P>
And who knows, it might have gotten better.

GEORGE BENSON RETURNS TO HIS JAZZ ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Benson is the Nat King Cole of the 1980s. Like Cole, he earned fame as 
an instrumentalist before reaching world renown as a singer. 
</P>
<P>
Now, just as Cole did late in his career, he has made an album that reminds the 
public of his origins. "Tenderly" (Warner Bros. 25907), in which the eminent 
jazz pianist McCoy Tyner plays a major role, entered the jazz chart Aug. 6 and 
has already leaped to the No. 1 spot. 
</P>
<P>
The guitarist, whose vocal personality made a fortune for him, plays on almost 
every track; three are strictly instrumental and the title cut is a guitar 
solo. 
</P>
<P>
"Even my pop fans like it," he said, just before leaving for a week in Brazil. 
"They like the ballady things. My wife fell in love with 'This Is All I Ask.' 
But what knocked me out was that my mother's favorite was 'I Could Write a 
Book,' which is strictly a jazz thing. And my stepfather, who taught me how to 
play ukulele and then guitar, starting when I was 9, now says that his faith in 
my playing is reaffirmed! He was always very helpful but sometimes very 
critical -- told me I was playing too fast and he couldn't follow me. But when 
he heard this album he said, 'Boy, that's what I call guitar playing!' " 
</P>
<P>
Benson, who will appear at the Wiltern Theatre Sept. 22-25, using his regular 
sidemen and an orchestra, recalls that his collaboration with Tyner came about 
by sheer chance. "Last year, on my way to the Blue Note Club in New York, I was 
listening to a jazz program on the radio and they played a tune from an old 
Johnny Hartman album. When they said McCoy Tyner was the pianist on it, I said 
to myself, 'He must have been a baby back then!' But he was already musically 
mature." (The album was made in 1963 with John Coltrane and Tyner, then 24, 
accompanying Hartman.) 
</P>
<P>
An idea occurred to Benson. "I realized how well McCoy plays behind vocalists, 
and of course we're both instrumentalists. I decided to get in touch with him. 
Our sons are close friends -- they're both together now. The next day, McCoy's 
son was over at my house and I said 'Get in touch with your pop and ask him if 
he'd like to make a record with me.' His father called back from Europe and 
said he would." 
</P>
<P>
Aware that record companies, when confronted with noncommercial projects, react 
as if they have been asked to commit suicide, Benson went into a studio and 
produced the first five songs on his own. "The Japanese booked us as soon as 
word reached them that we were in the studio! Then George Wein got word of the 
record and set us up with a European tour." 
</P>
<P>
Having launched the idea, Benson got in touch his producer, Tommy Li Puma. 
"Tommy then contacted the record company and got them real excited. Even Mo 
Ostin, the chairman of the board at Warners, called and said, 'George, this is 
a gutsy move, to do an album like that at this time in your career.' " 
</P>
<P>
The three-week European tour lived up to everyone's expectations. "We had a lot 
of fans who came because they'd heard my name, but many of them knew McCoy's 
name and were curious to see what was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Benson found himself involved in several other jazz 
partnerships. "I guest-starred with Dizzy Gillespie in Europe. Boy, was he 
packing them in! I like working with the old-timers because that's really where 
I learned to play; in fact, when I was growing up, I always wanted to get into 
that bag. My first recorded attempts at that kind of music were for Columbia, 
which is why John Hammond liked me, I guess." (The late John Hammond recorded 
Benson in a series of strictly instrumental small group sessions in 1966-67. 
"The George Benson Cookbook" is still available only in cassette form on 
CS9413.) 
</P>
<P>
Japan, typically, offered Benson and Tyner the most wide-ranging chances to 
stretch out. "Over there, we had additional help from Freddie Hubbard on 
trumpet and Joe Henderson on saxophone. That exciting horn sound gave us even 
more of a jazz flavor," Benson said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, playing in the Newport Jazz Festival's Guitar Workshop, Benson was 
hailed by Down Beat as "a young guitarist with roots in Charlie Christian and a 
wonderful beat." The reference to Christian, who revolutionized jazz guitar in 
his 1939-40 recordings with Benny Goodman, came to mind again last June when 
Benson was teamed with Lionel Hampton in a Carnegie Hall concert, "Hamp and 
George Salute Benny." "That was the greatest honor in the world," he says, 
"sitting in for Charlie Christian and bringing back the tunes he and Benny and 
Lionel played back then." (Benson played and recorded briefly with Goodman in 
the '70s.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite the wealth and worldwide acclaim his singing has brought him, Benson 
(and again the parallel with Nat King Cole is clear) still wants to retain the 
respect of the musicians and jazz fans who were his original admirers. "It's 
real nice," he says, "to do an album like this new one and have some jazz 
people say appreciate things about you." 
</P>
<P>
Benson's success seems to have mellowed him; part of the cause, or possibly the 
effect, may be his religious convictions. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a dedicated Jehovah's Witness for 10 years," he says, "and I studied 
the Bible long before that. I think I've changed my ways a little from my wild 
young days. I'm very careful in what I do; I'm no saint, but I do try to keep 
away from anything that will bring reproach on me. Religion has helped me 
escape some pitfalls -- helped me, I like to think, become a better man."

HOW GOES THE MUSIC VIDEO REVOLUTION?; 
</P>
<P>
THEY HAVEN'T REPLACED RADIO AS A MARKETING TOOL, BUT THEY'RE STILL GAINING 
MOMENTUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT

<TEXT>
<P>
Soon after MTV went on the air in the summer of 1981, the word was that videos 
were going to revolutionize the record business. 
</P>
<P>
The new, three-to-five-minute promotional clips would not only cause television 
to replace radio as the dominant medium for selling records, but an artist's 
look might become as important as the music. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, videos seemed well on the way to fulfilling that promise. The 
success in the early and mid-'80s of such colorful, video-conscious acts as 
Michael Jackson, Madonna and Duran Duran did indeed suggest the important thing 
in pop was as much what you heard as what you saw. 
</P>
<P>
But what now? 
</P>
<P>
Have videos, as some rapturously predicted, replaced radio as the chief means 
of selling acts? And has appearance become as important as music as a basis for 
signing acts? 
</P>
<P>
Based on interviews with a variety of music-industry executives on the eve of 
Wednesday's sixth annual MTV Video Awards ceremony at the Universal 
Amphitheatre, the answer is that, yes, video is continuing to gain strength as 
a marketing tool, but, no, video hasn't replaced radio as the chief means of 
selling records. 
</P>
<P>
The negative aspect of the expanded music video market is the waste factor. 
More are being made but, conversely, more aren't being played. 
</P>
<P>
"Every record company has a shelf full of videos that have never seen the light 
of day and never will," pointed out Jo Bergman, vice president of Warner Bros. 
video department. "The problem is that many of them should never have been made 
-- for whatever reason. Some are made too late or too early (in terms of 
drawing attention to the single). Some aren't very good and don't get played 
for that reason. Some are made just because the artist's contract calls for a 
video." 
</P>
<P>
Added Jeff Gold, A&amp;M Records' vice president of marketing and creative 
services: "In the early days of music video, things were different. The 
channels were starved for programming. It was easier to get videos played. Not 
as many music videos were made and the ones that were made were played 
somewhere. If a label made 50 music videos in a year in those days, all of them 
would be shown somewhere. Now if you make 50, maybe 15 might get aired." 
</P>
<P>
Often a record company can justify making music videos for another reason: They 
can be vital marketing tools in foreign markets, creating an image for artists 
who've never appeared there. "These days companies sign artists with worldwide 
potential," Bill Berger, executive vice president of Arista Records, said. 
"They need videos to market artists in places like Europe and the Orient. Even 
if the video doesn't get played in the United States, it might get played in 
some foreign country and help sales over there." 
</P>
<P>
All of the more than a dozen industry executives interviewed agreed that music 
video is continuing to gain importance, thanks to the increased penetration by 
cable TV into American homes and the rise in recent years of two additional 
all-music cable channels, VH-1, which aims at an older pop-rock crowd than MTV, 
and Black Entertainment Television, which specializes in soul and rap styles. 
</P>
<P>
But, executives were quick to point out, music videos alone still cannot create 
a hit record. 
</P>
<P>
"Radio airplay is still the most important (device) for selling records," said 
Bob Willcox, vice president of marketing for Columbia Records. "That's because 
it still offers us the biggest audience." 
</P>
<P>
Videos have encouraged record companies to think more visually -- though, they 
insist, not at the expense of the music. 
</P>
<P>
"Since music videos came along, the look of an act has become much more 
important than it ever was," said Ron McCarrell, Capitol Records' vice 
president of marketing. "But make no mistake -- music is still the most 
important thing. An act can have the right look and come across great in the 
videos, but if the music isn't good, the act won't get very far. You still have 
to consider radio and having the right look doesn't do you any good on radio." 
</P>
<P>
Video, in the early days of MTV, brought new excitement to the record industry. 
After passing the $4-billion-a-year mark in sales in the late '70s, the 
industry had been in a serious slump, with sales falling about $500,000,000 
between 1978 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The drop-off, industry observers now believe, was due to more than just general 
problems with the economy. Teen-agers, long the most active buying group, 
seemed alienated. They had burned out on disco and were having trouble finding 
new heroes as radio stations tended to stay with veteran rockers that the kids 
found tame and boring. 
</P>
<P>
But video provided these teens with a new wave of heroes. MTV was their own 
private world. Parents grumbled about videos, dismissing them as silly gimmicks 
to sell records. They couldn't believe that anyone could sit in their rooms 
watching those videos all day and night on MTV -- as their kids were doing. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, however, many adults became converts. The audience for videos 
expanded, encouraging record companies to begin making them for artists in 
other genres -- not just for teen-oriented music. This adult interest also led 
to the formation of the additional cable music channels. 
</P>
<P>
In July, according to Nielsen Media Research figures, 56.4% of the nation's TV 
households were connected to cable, as opposed to 39.3% in 1983. MTV is still 
the cable-music-channel champ, reaching 47 million homes -- up from just 20 
million homes five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
VH-1 -- owned by MTV Networks, also the parent company of MTV -- claims it can 
be seen in 34 million cable homes, up from just 14 million homes three years 
ago. BET, which has steadily increased in stature and prominence in the last 
few years, is in 23 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
While MTV is stronger than ever, it's not what it used to be. Instead of simply 
playing videos all day and night, MTV now sees itself as an entertainment 
network, devoting much of its time to a variety of programming, including the 
"Remote Control" game show, a comedy show and programs like "Yo! MTV Raps" and 
"Headbangers Ball," which spotlight certain genres. 
</P>
<P>
Still, MTV continues to be the most powerful cable music channel, especially 
for the rock audience. The competition -- VH-1 and BET -- pick up where MTV 
leaves off. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Jeff Rowe, VH-1's vice president of programming: "We program what's 
hip for the (over 25) group, the best of Top 40, the best of AOR 
(album-oriented rock). This audience grew up on rock 'n' roll but is too old 
for what's being played on MTV. Their tastes have changed somewhat but they're 
used to watching music clips -- so they tune in VH-1." 
</P>
<P>
Black artists too have benefited from the changes in the music-video scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago there was no place for black artists on video," said Capitol's 
McCarrell. "It was tougher to justify a video for a black artist. But now more 
black videos are being made since there's an outlet for them -- an outlet that 
gets results." 
</P>
<P>
These added forums have encouraged record companies to make videos for more 
artists than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
MTV's statistics show the significant increase in the number of music clips 
since the early '80s. In May, 1982, music videos were made to promote 28 of the 
singles in the Top 100 songs on the Billboard sales chart in 1982. During a 
recent week, all but three of the Top 100 singles had accompanying videos. 
</P>
<P>
Another indication of the rise in clip productivity -- the number of music 
videos made -- is how many are submitted to MTV. "The difference between now 
and years ago is staggering," said Lee Masters, MTV's executive vice president 
and general manager. "In the early '80s we used to screen five or six a week. 
Now we're getting 30 to 40 a week, sometimes more." 
</P>
<P>
For the record companies, there's a downside to all this -- the costs of making 
videos are way up. It's an expense the companies share with the artists. 
</P>
<P>
McCarrell explained how the system works: "The companies front the costs of the 
videos in nearly all cases. If the artist winds up selling enough records to 
make a profit, the record company can recoup some of that expense -- maybe as 
much as half. But the deals vary with the artists." 
</P>
<P>
Arista's Berger pointed out that most videos now cost between $50,000 and 
$125,000, while the average cost of a video in the early '80s was about 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lamented McCarrell: "There was a time when you might do two videos for $18,000. 
That's out of the question now. Those bargain days are long gone." 
</P>
<P>
Music videos, the executives pointed out, can create an excitement and a 
mystique about an artist like nothing else can. Look at what they did for 
Michael Jackson, enhancing his stardom by magnifying his image and blanketing 
the country with it. 
</P>
<P>
Music videos can also expand an artist's audience by reaching fans who don't go 
to concerts or kids in out of the way places who don't have easy access to 
major concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Niven, manager of Guns N' Roses, the hottest new hard-rock band in years, 
noted: 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk to kids out there in certain parts of the country, they'll tell 
you their total exposure to music is watching MTV. For a band like Guns N' 
Roses, that MTV audience is the core audience. Music videos expose kids to a 
band and inspire them to buy records by creating visual excitement. Without 
music videos, there's a lot of fans who might not be turned on to Guns N' 
Roses." 
</P>
<P>
While music videos can be influential in all areas of pop, they seem to have 
the most impact in the areas of hard rock/heavy metal and rap. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's Willcox said videos are important in both of these areas because MTV 
often leads the way by playing videos of singles even before the records are 
played on radio. That early TV video exposure, in fact, can in some cases 
influence what's eventually played on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, MTV has helped break Living Colour -- a black rock band whose 
album, "Vivid," started very slowly until it began getting the TV exposure, and 
Winger, the hot new metal band. Poison and Great White, two other metal bands, 
also got massive boosts from music videos. 
</P>
<P>
Once an underground phenomenon, rap has become increasingly mainstream, partly 
thanks to video exposure on MTV and BET. Tone Loc and D.J. Jazzy Jeff and the 
Fresh Prince are among the rappers who have benefited from video airplay. In 
addition to black youngsters, rap appeals to white hard-rock and metal fans who 
are attracted to its raunchy, rebellious qualities. 
</P>
<P>
"Music videos are now indispensable to rap," Arista's Berger explained. "That 
MTV show ('Yo! MTV Raps') has really helped. About 10 or 12 months ago, you 
might not have made a rap video because it didn't seem necessary. Now, we've 
seen the impact a rap video can have on both sales and image. If you have the 
budget, you make the rap video. It can have a big effect on that young target 
audience -- both black and white -- that's into rap." 
</P>
<P>
What's next for music videos? 
</P>
<P>
Possibly the emergence of another music channel or two to expand the market 
even further. Also, record companies are so desperate for alternatives to the 
main music channels that they'll probably develop some new outlets of their 
own. But the music video, some executives speculate, may not be invincible. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe something that hasn't been developed yet will replace music videos in 
the next decade," Warner Brothers' Bergman speculated. "Technology is changing 
things so fast. VCRs and CDs and music videos came about in this decade. The 
way things have been changing, if something came along and replaced music 
videos I don't think many people would be surprised."

TOLLIVER, MCKNIGHT OUT FOR AT LEAST SIX WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
One second separated Billy Joe Tolliver, the Chargers' rookie quarterback, from 
a smashing preseason. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Tolliver will be hanging around the sidelines for about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After driving the Chargers 56 yards in the final two minutes of Friday's 21-20 
victory over Phoenix, Tolliver ran left on third and goal from the Cardinal 
five. He picked up a yard and a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
One second remained, and Jim McMahon trotted on and threw a touchdown pass to 
Quinn Early. The extra point won the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite a finish," McMahon said. "Those guys moved the ball down to the five, 
and all I had to do was hit the guy. (Tolliver) has got a lot of nerve. He is 
going to be a heck of a quarterback in this league." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver progressed nicely during the exhibition season, as shown by his poise 
during the two-minute offense Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's shown poise all camp," Charger Coach Dan Henning said. "I have no 
problems in that area whatsoever. I expected a lot of him, but he's better than 
I expected." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also lost veteran center/guard Dennis McKnight to a thigh injury. 
He was operated on Saturday and will miss at least six weeks, possibly more. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he hasn't discussed the possibility of shopping for another 
quarterback and wouldn't rule out starting the regular season with just two. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight's injury may have saved the job of 14-year veteran Don Macek, whose 
lock on the center position is being threatened by rookie Courtney Hall. Hall 
played what Henning described as a "steady, workman-like, 
more-veteran-than-rookie type of performance" on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of McKnight also adds to Henning's concern about the Chargers' long 
snapping. Tight end Andy Parker, out nearly four weeks with a knee injury, did 
some while with the Raiders, and Henning said there is a possibility he may be 
healthy for Sunday's opener. 
</P>
<P>
Next week's cuts may offer another option. Randy Kirk, former San Diego State 
player who did long snapping for the Chargers last season, is second on the 
Cardinals' depth chart at outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Burt Grossman has been in town just a little more than a week, and he has 
already figured out a few things. 
</P>
<P>
1. San Diego is nicer than Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
2. He isn't in top form yet but expects to be by mid-season. 
</P>
<P>
3. He isn't as outrageous as McMahon but expects to be by midseason. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, this is the guy whose house pets include a boa constrictor and 
"Bernie," the pit bull. Bernie was named after Bernhard Goetz. He used to think 
he and McMahon were very similar. No more. He has figured out you have to work 
to be that eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
"You meet him, and you figure out he's in a class by himself," Grossman says. 
"I'm not at that point yet. Maybe at midseason I'll have that form." 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Pitt defensive schemes are still log-jamming in his mind with 
all the new Charger stuff he's being taught, Grossman turned in an ample 
performance against Phoenix with two tackles, an assist and a half sack. 
</P>
<P>
He also victim of an illegal crack-back block, which contributed to a bruised 
knee, 15 penalty yards and a worried coach. It happened the play after his 
sack. 
</P>
<P>
Say anything to the guilty party, Burt? 
</P>
<P>
"Naw," he said. "I chased him down on a screen four plays later and speared him 
in the back." 
</P>
<P>
He's optimistic about the Chargers' potential defensively. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, I think we ended up giving up 265 yards total offense, which is a 
low number for any team," he said. "For Pop Warner, it's a low number. So 
obviously that's a tell-tale sign we must be doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
Running back Gary Anderson is expected to make a statement today regarding his 
plans for this season. Anderson, the Chargers' 1988 MVP, has reached a 
stalemate in contract negotiations and is said to be considering options other 
than playing for the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers aren't expected to announce further cuts until Monday, when the 
team is required to trim its roster to 47.

AIR FORCE'S DOWIS TRAMPLES ON HOPES FOR AZTECS' REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all the hope of a better start . . . for all the promise of an improved 
defense . . . for all the expectations of another new beginning for San Diego 
State football . . . the debut of Coach Al Luginbill looked an awful lot like 
what led to the demise of his recent predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztec defense was run to shambles by quarterback Dee Dowis and the Air 
Force wishbone. The offense scored mainly when it was too late to matter. And 
the special teams let the Aztecs down again. 
</P>
<P>
What was supposed to be remembered for the debut of Luginbill, the 13th 
football coach in Aztec history, instead will go down as the day Dowis made 
another kind of Aztec history. 
</P>
<P>
His six touchdowns in a 52-36 Air Force victory in front of 44,579 at Falcon 
Stadium Saturday matched a feat accomplished by an opponent only once before in 
67 seasons of Aztec football, and his 249 yards on the ground paced the most 
prolific team rushing performance ever against them. 
</P>
<P>
Dowis scored on runs of 55, 28, 12, 16, 60 and 17 yards. The six touchdowns 
broke the Western Athletic Conference record of five, held by several players, 
and matched the most ever against the Aztecs. Dick Bass, who went on to an 
all-pro career with the Rams, set the record of six in a 68-17 Pacific victory 
in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
That rout, for those old enough to remember, spurred the Pacific side to chant: 
"It's not too late for 68." The Tigers did reach 68 to set an opponent scoring 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately this time for the Aztecs, Dowis left the game before the Falcons 
could get within shouting distance of that mark. He did not return after 
scoring his sixth touchdown with 11:41 to play. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not a one-man team, but he was close to that today," Luginbill said. 
"That is the best performance I have ever seen by an individual player, ever." 
</P>
<P>
Dowis' juked and dashed and dove through the Aztec defense. His deceptiveness 
made for a difficult time in the Aztec secondary. He appeared cornered several 
times, only to slip by. 
</P>
<P>
"You see him coming, you think you have him, and then all of a sudden, 'boom,' 
he cuts right by you," senior safety John Wesselman said. "I'm sure glad I 
don't have to play him again." 
</P>
<P>
He is not alone. In his three games against the Aztecs, Dowis has rushed for 
514 yards and seven touchdowns on just 39 carries for an average gain of 13.2 
yards per rush. 
</P>
<P>
He needed only 13 carries to gain his 249 yards this time. Only three of his 
carries were for less than first-down yardage; he averaged 19.2 yards per 
carry. He also completed three of seven passes for 59 yards. 
</P>
<P>
All this from a mite of player who stands 5-feet-10 and weighs 153 pounds, or 
so the Falcons claim. His lack of physical stature is the source of much 
good-natured humor. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not scared to go into the training room without his shirt on (this year) 
because he has some body definition," Air Force Coach Fisher DeBerry said, 
smiling. "Dee showed San Diego what kind of surgeon he is. He cut them up." 
</P>
<P>
But Dowis was only the biggest part of what was another humbling performance by 
the Air Force wishbone. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons finished with 559 yards rushing on 62 carries, an average of 9.0 
yards per play. That broke the Aztec opponent record of 513 yards Air Force set 
in a 38-7 victory in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Junior fullback Rodney Lewis was the other major contributor, with 128 yards on 
15 carries, and sophomore halfback Chris Howard added the only other Falcon 
touchdown on a five-yard run in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
This game had all the unflattering Aztec characteristics that were present in 
each of the lopsided defeats that have scarred the program since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
There were penalties: nine for 66 yards. 
</P>
<P>
There were turnovers: two interceptions of Dan McGwire passes -- one of which 
bounced off running back Darrin Wagner and into waiting Air Force hands. Both 
led to touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
There were special teams breakdowns: a missed extra point, a blocked extra 
point and a missed 23-yard field goal by freshman Andy Trakas. 
</P>
<P>
But more than anything, there were the recurring defensive breakdowns: The 
Aztecs surrendered 618 yards in total offense, the most by an opponent in three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
That had to hit hardest at Luginbill who once, while defensive coordinator at 
Arizona State in the early 1980s, oversaw the stingiest defense in college 
football 
</P>
<P>
"There are certainly no magicians on the defensive side of the ball," said 
Luginbill, who was making his return to coach after a three-year layoff. "I'm 
not a magician; that was proved today." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill's debut started with promise when, on the fifth play of the game, 
senior running back Ron Slack ran 68 yards for a touchdown. And the Falcons 
gave the Aztecs an opportunity to increase the lead when they failed on fourth 
and two from their own 38. But after driving to the Air Force five, Trakas 
missed a 23-yard field goal attempt on fourth and one. 
</P>
<P>
Then Dowis and the Falcons went to work. They scored touchdowns on five of 
their next six possessions, failing only when Dowis was rested for a series. 
Dowis had four of those scores. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been involved in games before when you jump out with a quick big play," 
Luginbill said, "and sometimes it can come back to hurt you because you think 
it will be too easy." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs did pull to within 35-16 just before the half, but the Falcons 
scored the only 10 points of the third quarter to effectively close out the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects on offense were not much more encouraging. The Aztec quick-pass 
attack had a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't execute as well we could in the first half. We started clicking in 
the second half," Luginbill said. "We should have taken advantage of the 
opportunities when they arose. That hurt our football team as much as not being 
able to stop Dowis." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs had the ball at the Air Force five, four, and 14 in the first three 
quarters and produced only one field goal. 
</P>
<P>
They did manage to produce some impressive statistics, including 546 yards of 
total offense, but most of the points came in the fourth quarter, after they 
had fallen behind, 45-16. And all of it came against a defense that last year 
was almost as woeful as their own. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire completed 30 of 46 passes for 361 yards and two touchdowns. But his two 
interceptions led to Falcon touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Slack carried 14 times for a career-high 135 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
And senior wide receiver Monty Gilbreath caught a career-high 10 passes for 82 
yards to extend his streak of consecutive games with at least one reception to 
26. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said despite the magnitude of the loss, he was heartened in that the 
Aztecs did rally at the end with their 20 fourth-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
But they have little opportunity to savor such improvements. Next up for them 
is No. 9 UCLA Sept. 16 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Combined score of the 
Aztecs' past three losses to the Bruins: 151-34. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dee Dowis missed the Aztec opponent record for points in a game by two. Dick 
Bass of Pacific had a two-point conversion in addition to his six touchdowns in 
1958. . . . Cornerback Marlon Andrews, a junior transfer from Pasadena City 
College, left the game early in the first quarter with a bruised right ankle 
and did not return. Junior linebacker Sai Niu bruised his right thumb. Neither 
injury is considered serious, trainer Brian Barry said. . . . Wide receiver 
Patrick Rowe, who did not make the trip and missed most of the preseason with a 
sore knee, is expected to practice Monday, Barry said. 
</P>

Cornerback Brian Mitchell's 97-yard interception return on the final play of 
the third quarter broke open a close game, and No. 19 Brigham Young beat New 
Mexico, 24-3, Saturday night in a Western Athletic Conference college football 
opener at Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
BYU led, 7-3, when Mitchell intercepted the pass thrown by split end Terance 
Mathis on the final play of the quarter and raced for the touchdown. The Cougar 
defense held New Mexico to seven yards offense in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
BYU's first drive of the fourth quarter stalled when sophomore quarterback Ty 
Detmer fumbled on New Mexico's 17. But BYU scored on its next two possessions, 
Fred Whittingham on a 15-yard run and Jason Chaffetz on a 22-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer scored BYU's first touchdown on a four-yard bootleg to open the second 
half and give the Cougars the 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
BYU struggled throughout the first half but took command in the third quarter 
as the defense sacked New Mexico's Jeremy Leach three times and held the Lobos 
to minus three yards in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer completed 18 of 29 passes for 317 yards for BYU. Tight end Chris Smith 
caught five passes for 114 yards. New Mexico's Leach was 16 for 39 for 195 
yards with one interception before leaving the game midway through the fourth 
quarter with a bruised elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville 28, Wyoming 21 -- David Moyler, running down the right sideline, 
caught a pass from Browning Nagle and scored on a 34-yard play with just over 
four minutes remaining to give the Cardinals a victory over the Cowboys at 
Laramie, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
Consecutive holding penalties against Louisville left the Cardinals facing a 
second-and-33 situation when they scored the game-winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming, which beat Louisville, 44-9, a year ago, hadn't lost a home game since 
early in the 1987 season, when it lost to Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Utah St. 24, St. Mary's 23 -- Jason Thornburg sacked St. Mary's 
quarterback Tim Rosenkranz an attempted two-point conversion with two minutes 
left to preserve Southern Utah State's victory at Moraga, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's rallied from a 24-10 fourth-quarter deficit and pulled to within one 
point when James Javier scored from the one-yard line. But Rosenkranz couldn't 
get a pass off before being sacked on the conversion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Kelvin Minefee rushed for 117 yards and two touchdowns for Southern Utah, which 
had 210 yards on the ground and 371 yards of total offense. Rick Carter, 
playing the second half, passed for 140 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenkranz passed for 232 yards and one touchdown. His 14-yard pass to Jason 
Sol triggered the team's fourth-quarter comeback attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Reno 41, Southern Illinois 3 -- Eric Smith rushed for 109 yards in eight 
carries to lead Nevada Reno to a victory at Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Reno, trailing 3-0 late in the second quarter, capitalized on a muffed punt 
return and scored on a 28-yard touchdown pass from Fred Gatlin to Treamelle 
Taylor to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada then scored touchdowns on six consecutive possessions. 
</P>
<P>
To open the second half, UNR scored on a 13-play drive capped by a four-yard 
touchdown pass from starting quarterback Steve Backster to tight end Tom 
Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
UNR took no more than five plays to score on each successful drive. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Illinois' score came on a 37-yard field goal by John Bookout in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Backster hit eight of 13 passes for 73 yards and a touchdown. Gatlin hit five 
of 10 for 55 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The game, played before 15,280, was UNR's largest opening day crowd.

As Kwon Sun Choi talked to a visitor in a tiny office in a San Pedro martial 
arts studio, barefoot little kids dressed in white robes continually 
interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
"An Nyung He Ke Ship Si O," each repeated rapidly, almost unintelligibly. The 
office door would spring open and close almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Choi, a master in the Korean art of self-defense called taekwondo, was not 
upset. In fact, he smiled and nodded each time as the youths in Do-Boks stuck 
their heads through the crack of the door, to the amusement of the visitor. 
</P>
<P>
"This country is too free," Choi said. "Taekwondo teaches respect and 
discipline to these kids." 
</P>
<P>
A two-time coach at the United States Olympic Festival, Choi is a sixth-degree 
black belt in a martial art that is among the fastest-growing leisure 
activities in America. 
</P>
<P>
An 11-time national champion in his native Korea, he has no reservations in 
declaring his intent to someday become the coach of the U.S. Olympic team. In 
the 1992 games, in Barcelona, Spain, taekwondo will be a demonstration sport. 
</P>
<P>
Choi, 35, was the first coach west of the Mississippi to be selected for an 
Olympic Festival post from more than 3,000 masters in the country. He is 
best-known for his advancement of New Form Competition Style Techniques, one of 
several schools of thought in the event. 
</P>
<P>
"At his age, he is right at the top of the sport," said Chan Yong Kim, 
president of the California Taekwondo Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Taekwondo is basically a defensive sport, unlike other forms of martial arts 
such as judo and karate, according to Lou Solo, manager of the Tae Kwon Do 
Training Center. 
</P>
<P>
Literally translated, Tae Kwon Do (it has been condensed to one word in the 
United States) means "the art of hand and foot fighting." Students learn 
poomse, a ritual mind-set that prepares them to "always block, never attack, 
then defend yourself," explained Solo. 
</P>
<P>
The masters are the supreme leaders. Their positions command respect. On this 
day everyone at the studio referred to Choi as Master Choi, and everyone, 
including the guests, followed a time-honored Korean tradition of removing 
their shoes before entering the building. 
</P>
<P>
The seemingly impolite students who popped through the door to say "An Nyung He 
Ke Ship Si O" were actually paying respect to their master by saying goodby 
after an early-evening practice session at the storefront center on Pacific 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Even masters have masters (called grand masters) of their own to perpetuate 
further study and respect. Choi is president of the Do Jongs, an elite 
intercommittee of the state association. Through learning, Choi says, he hopes 
to perfect new methods of training that will set him apart from other masters 
who might also seek the U.S. Olympic post. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is changing," he said. "I need more study." Choi hopes such 
education will allow him to become a grand master. 
</P>
<P>
"For people of Choi's caliber, this is not just a martial art, it is a way of 
life," said Mike Furman, president of the center's Black Belt Club and parent 
of two of Choi's pupils. 
</P>
<P>
Choi studied at Sung Kyun Kwan University in Seoul, then left more than a 
decade ago to teach taekwondo in other parts of the world. He spent six years 
in Spain, then moved to Los Angeles, where a grand master enticed him to enter 
business at the studio in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
He dreams of being a high school physical education teacher here, but the drive 
to be an Olympic head coach is strong enough that he admits he will leave this 
country if he gets a good offer somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, the state taekwondo chief, said Choi is almost a lock for some type of 
Olympic coaching spot in this country. "I'm optimistic that he will play a 
major role on the coaching staff (of the United States)." 
</P>
<P>
If Choi does leave, that would be bad news to people such as Solo and Furman, 
who have helped Choi develop a highly successful taekwando junior team. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, three of his students qualified to participate in the first 
International Junior Festival. A year ago, at the National Junior Olympics, the 
team won 10 medals, including six golds. 
</P>
<P>
Said Furman: "Choi has such an eye for talent." 
</P>
<P>
Choi, speaking with a heavy Korean accent, prefers to spread the gospel of 
taekwando, rather than talk about himself. "Taekwando is mental training," he 
said. "Whoever needs discipline and physical improvement can use it." 
</P>
<P>
During a session with the youths, ages 7-15, Choi put his charges through a 
treadmill of moves, speaking only Korean. American and Korean flags hung on a 
wall, and pictures of students in various sparring matches ringed the room. 
Students are required to know all commands in Korean. Still, a sign in English 
said: "No pain, no gain." 
</P>
<P>
The children handled it all in stride. When ordered to attention or to sit, 
even the little ones obeyed immediately with shouts of, "Yes, sir." 
</P>
<P>
Watching from the sidelines, Solo, an American-born black belt, said: 
"Taekwondo is constant discipline." 
</P>
<P>
Choi, who began to study the sport at 8, explained that taekwondo training in 
Korea begins in kindergarten and continues as part of school curriculum into 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Choi would like to see the same field of study introduced in United States. He 
claims to have turned around several wayward youths in his five years at the 
center.

NORTHRIDGE PUTS ON QUITE AN EXHIBITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA-USC rivalry might be one of the nation's greatest in college football, 
but there is no comparison between the schools when the sport is soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge proved that in resounding fashion Saturday night, whipping 
the Trojans, 5-0, in an exhibition soccer match before 851 onlookers at North 
Campus Stadium. The Matadors lost to UCLA, 2-1, in an exhibition opener a week 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, runner-up in the past two NCAA Division II championships, dominated 
play against USC, a club team, outshooting the Trojans, 26-0. 
</P>
<P>
Five Matadors scored goals, including Haaratch (Danny) Daniels, a freshman from 
Nicosia, Cyprus, who capped the Northridge scoring on an assist from Andy 
Torres at the 85:38 mark. 
</P>
<P>
USC goalkeeper Joe Livengood had blocked Torres' penalty shot from the left 
side, but Daniels was there to convert the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Jim Hofferber had given the Matadors a 4-0 lead 10 minutes earlier 
when he headed in Daniels' corner kick off the left goal post. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory, Northridge Coach Marwan Ass'ad was disappointed with his 
team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well," Ass'ad said. "I didn't like what I saw. We still miss 
Scott Piri a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"USC brought us down to their level tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Piri, a sophomore from Burroughs High in Ridgecrest and the Matadors' leading 
scorer last season, suited up for Saturday's match but did not play because of 
a groin injury. Piri also missed the UCLA match. 
</P>
<P>
"When Scott returns we will be much better," Ass'ad promised. "He makes 
everyone else play better." 
</P>
<P>
Piri is expected to be in the lineup for Friday night's regular-season opener 
against Division I Cal State Los Angeles. But he wasn't needed against USC. 
</P>
<P>
With the Northridge defense -- led by midfielder Ed Burns -- smothering the USC 
attack, goalkeepers Mike Littman and Mike Gonzalez weren't required to make a 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Northridge offense spent most of the evening running a variety 
of plays at USC's end of the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people on our defense played very well tonight," Ass'ad said. "But some 
of them are faster learners than others. We still have a lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
The first half was a precursor of things to come as Northridge took a 3-0 lead 
by outshooting the Trojans, 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Roberto Guerrero's unassisted goal gave Northridge a 3-0 lead at the 
36:55 mark and came after scores by sophomore Roberto Reyes (29:07) and senior 
Bill Durkin (12:22). 
</P>
<P>
Durkin scored on a header off Torres' corner kick to easily beat USC goalkeeper 
Mark Nevins, and Terry Davila fed Reyes with a pass that left him in a 
one-on-one situation against Nevins.

CAL LUTHERAN DEFEATED BY ALUMNI, INELIGIBLES IN FOOTBALL SCRIMMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Shoup called the Cal Lutheran football team's Saturday scrimmages a "dress 
rehearsal," and, unfortunately for the Cal Lutheran coach, the Kingsmen looked 
like "Les Miserables." 
</P>
<P>
Not only did they lose to the Alumni, 6-0, but the regulars also dropped a 
short scrimmage against players who are currently ineligible, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 Cal Lutheran players were unable to participate against the alumni 
because of academic eligibility question marks, but Shoup expects nearly all of 
them to be ready for the opener next Saturday at Sonoma State. So he scheduled 
a scrimmage between eligible players and ineligible players preceding the 
alumni game. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided not to treat that as an intra-squad scrimmage," Shoup said. "The 
assurance that (school administrators) gave me is that first thing next week 
they'll focus on this area and get it taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
The difficulties resulted from an administrative logjam that developed in the 
rush to determine the eligibility of all athletes in Cal Lutheran's fall 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
A few players, such as linebacker Kenny Steward, have more serious problems, 
but most have only to resolve such matters as recording summer-school grades 
and filing high school information. 
</P>
<P>
The wave of eligibility problems has created problems in Cal Lutheran's 
preparation for Sonoma State. By splitting his squad, Shoup was able to give 
everyone playing time, but it also stretched the Kingsmen thin and highlighted 
their shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little behind on defense and a lot behind on offense, and we're way 
behind on our kicking game," Shoup said. "I wish we were a little further 
along. . . . I think it was important for us to do this today. Now I feel like 
we can really get down to work." 
</P>
<P>
There were some standouts among the stand-ins on the ineligible team. Junior 
Darnell Mitchell dashed for 81 yards in eight carries. Mitchell, a Cal Lutheran 
baseball player who only recently joined the football team, tore down the right 
sideline on a 61-yard jaunt, the longest play of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is eligible, freshman quarterback Eddie Hoffman directed the 
ineligible squad's offense. Hoffman threw a three-yard touchdown pass and 
impressed Shoup with his poise. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Tim Zeddies hit junior tight end David Deisinger with a seven-yard 
strike over the middle for the eligible team's touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Only 20 alumni showed up for the featured game, but they nonetheless had enough 
manpower to beat the varsity in a 30-minute game. The alumni didn't have an 
experienced quarterback, so former receiver Greg Harris took the helm. Harris, 
who played football in England after leaving CLU in 1986, put enough English on 
the ball to complete 13 of 18 passes for 103 yards and a touchdown.

SAUGUS VICTORY GIVES SPANGLER POINTS LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Saugus Speedway Sportsman division points race took a surprising turn -- as 
did Dave Phipps' 1989 IROC Camaro -- just two laps into Saturday night's 40-lap 
main event before a crowd of 3,229. 
</P>
<P>
Phipps, a resident of Simi Valley, entered the evening as the division's points 
leader, pursuing an unprecedented third consecutive Sportsman title. 
</P>
<P>
But after making contact with the car of Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley, Phipps' 
car slammed into the front straightaway wall and was out of the race before its 
pistons had warmed. 
</P>
<P>
Phipps' misfortune left Keith Spangler of Northridge and Will Harper of Tarzana 
-- who trailed Phipps by six and seven points, respectively, at the start of 
the evening -- battling to assume the points lead. 
</P>
<P>
And Spangler won the battle, holding off Harper to win his third main event of 
the season and take an unofficial lead of three points in the seasonal race. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened early," Spangler said of Phipps' crash. "So, I just figured I 
could fall out, too. I just tried to think about the race, take it one step at 
a time." 
</P>
<P>
Spangler, who started in the second position, moved into the lead after racing 
resumed on the second lap. Harper, who started third, was unable to pass 
Spangler during the remaining 38 laps, which were delayed by a season-high six 
yellow flags. 
</P>
<P>
In the 25-lap Street Stock main event Russ Beckers of Sepulveda sped across a 
slippery, wet track to post a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Beckers, who started in the pole position, survived two extended yellow flags 
while track crew members swept the one-third-mile paved oval with drying 
compound after oil and water had coated the surface. 
</P>
<P>
On Lap 14, the car of Jim Marlewski of Simi Valley spewed oil in the outer 
lane, delaying proceedings for 15 minutes. On Lap 17, the car of Greg Benner of 
Whittier dumped radiator fluid, creating another lengthy delay. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mike Branam of San Fernando forced a red flag on Lap 22 when his 
car skidded into the infield without its left rear wheel, which rolled away. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Beckers, who entered the evening as the division's points 
leader, held on.

GOING BEYOND BEGINNER'S BASICS WHEN SELECTING, BUYING TOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Some material things in life are pure addiction. 
</P>
<P>
You start out one day pondering the joys of this newfangled device called a 
compact disc player and a few years later you just have to own one of those 
fancy models that plays five discs in sequence. 
</P>
<P>
And so it is with tools. After you learn how the balance of a good-quality 
hammer feels in the hand, before you know it, you're browsing the tool section 
of the hardware store just for fun. You're bringing home new gadgets whether 
you need them or not. 
</P>
<P>
So, when the thrill is gone from your basic tool kit, don't go wild. Go smart. 
Michael DiMenna of Schumann Hardware in Baltimore suggests these additional 
tools: 
</P>
<P>
Pipe wrench: This heavy metal tool with serrated jaws is used to turn pipe 
fittings or anything that's round. For different size jobs, you may want to buy 
an 8-inch wrench and a 10-inch wrench. Prices range from $8 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
Combination square: Some books suggest this as a "must have" for a basic tool 
kit, but you won't really need one unless you plan to do any project building. 
The square has a straight steel rule with a head station containing a small 
level. The head can be slipped along the rule and locked in any position for 
use as a marking gauge. Look for a 1-inch wide blade and expect to pay $4 to 
$5. 
</P>
<P>
Set of wood chisels: These long, narrow steel blades with a sharp, beveled 
front end come in a variety of shapes and are used to make cuts in wood by 
chipping. Select a variety of sizes from one-half to three-quarter inch and 
expect to pay $5 to $6 each. 
</P>
<P>
Cold chisel: Also known as a flat chisel, this tool has a tapered point on a 
thick, hexagonal steel bar. It's used to remove bolts and rivets and for 
cutting and chipping brass, copper and unhardened steel. Price: About $3. 
</P>
<P>
Small hacksaw: Use this fixed frame saw that holds a narrow, fine-toothed blade 
to cut metal or plastic. Expect to pay $4 to $10. 
</P>
<P>
Set of hex key wrenches: Also known by the brand name Allen wrench, this 
L-shaped, short, hexagonal metal bar is used for turning screws or bolts with a 
hexagonal opening. They are typically used to put together ready-to-assemble 
furniture and to repair air conditioner fan blades. The sets, in varying sizes, 
cost $3 to $5. 
</P>
<P>
Pocket plane: Planes are carpenters' tools used to shave wood from boards. They 
cost about $5. 
</P>
<P>
Sandpaper holder: For easier sanding, you may want to use a sandpaper holder. 
They come in sizes compatible with the sandpaper. Prices range from about $3.50 
to $6. 
</P>
<P>
Staple gun: Select a heavy-duty version and you will be able to tackle any 
project, from reupholstering a chair to tacking ceiling tiles. Expect to pay 
about $20. 
</P>
<P>
Glue gun: Use a glue gun for any large wood or household gluing jobs. Cost: 
About $12 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
Soldering gun: This tool is similar to a soldering iron but it is shaped like a 
gun. Use it to melt solder for making electrical connections. Price is about 
$19.

the basic tool chest is assembled are a pipe wrench, wood chisels and a staple 
gun.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the readers who complain about the new Real Estate Section don't 
realize the paper goes to more than a million subscribers, many of whom want to 
buy or sell houses, fix them up inside and out or perhaps landscape the 
grounds. If these grousing readers aren't interested in such things, let them 
read only commercial trade papers, of which there are aplenty. 
</P>
<P>
I've been reading The Times for 40-plus years and have bought thousands of 
dollars worth of ads in the Real Estate Section. 
</P>
<P>
I read the section then mainly to check placement of ads. Now I read it with 
great interest as a homeowner and real estate investor. If I were a contractor, 
developer or anyone else in the real estate business, I'm sure I would still 
want to read it, as a direct line to customers with useful feedback.

CUTE LITTLE HOUSE IS ABOUT TO BE LESS CUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Cute starter. 
</P>
<P>
That's what our house was when my husband and I bought it three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Cute is real estatespeak for "small." And our house is. Just a hair over 1,000 
square feet, with two smallish bedrooms, one smallish bath and a former one-car 
attached garage that was long ago converted into a decent office space. 
</P>
<P>
You know the type: little 1940 stucco tract house, the "affordable housing" of 
its day. When we bought it for what seemed like an astronomical $175,000, it 
was the kind of house you walk into and say, "Nice little house, but the 
kitchen has got to go." Within a year, go it did. 
</P>
<P>
Now we have a nifty kitchen in a house that is still cute as in small, but not 
very cute as in cute. We also have a baby (very cute), and would like to have 
another. Which has brought us to the same conclusion that every other young 
couple in the universe seems to have reached: We have to build more space. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as luck would have it, this old house is on what real estate agents call a 
buildable lot. That means it has a big back yard. But yards are not at a 
premium the way buildable space is. 
</P>
<P>
So we went to an architect, "Frank" (not his real name). We explained that we 
wanted to add a master bedroom and bath, enlarge the living room and generally 
make the place suitable for yuppie habitation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Separate Visions 
</P>
<P>
Frank seems like a very competent architect, and a nice guy. But there is a 
fundamental difference between his vision and ours. We look at our house and 
say, "What can we do with this house?" Frank looks at our house and says, "What 
can we do on this lot?" 
</P>
<P>
His answers, consequently, are a bit grander in scale than ours. We readjusted 
our thinking to take a grander view. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
On the trendy Westside, housing prices are . . . well, let's call them what 
they are. Obscene. OK? Anyway, along came a bank and appraised our cute Mar 
Vista house with the nice kitchen at an incredible $360,000. I'll skip the 
math, but the result is that we easily qualified for a $100,000 home 
improvement loan. Easily. Would we like to set up a credit line for an 
additional $20,000? No problem. 
</P>
<P>
No one seems concerned about how we are going to make the payments with a 
combined income that essentially hasn't risen since we bought the house. 
</P>
<P>
But I digress. 
</P>
<P>
Frank offered a choice of three floor plans he called generic: The bedrooms go 
here, the bathrooms go there. We mixed and matched features of the three, and 
Frank revised the drawings. We kicked it around, and Frank again revised the 
drawings. Maybe it was my imagination, but the plan seemed to get grander with 
each revision of the drawings. 
</P>
<P>
The figure Frank tossed out for remodeling a house and putting in nice 
finishing touches was $100 a square foot. To mis-paraphrase someone who is 
dead, a few square feet here, a few square feet there, and pretty soon you are 
talking about real money. 
</P>
<P>
At last we all agreed on a floor plan, and Frank began working on elevations, 
which are drawings of what we will actually see. 
</P>
<P>
We mulled the first interior and exterior elevations. Were they interesting or 
were they weird? Elegantly simple or cold and austere? Innovative or 
disjointed? Answer: We hit our first major disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
At first, it had been easy. We could sit with Frank and tell him we want our 
house to be airy and bright, with a warm, family feeling and imaginative, 
charming touches. We would lob out abstractions, he would offer ideas, and we 
could vote "Yes," "No" or "Yes But." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Winning Concessions 
</P>
<P>
But the time came when we had to make concrete choices. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of delicate and sometimes tense negotiations, we won concessions 
from him, such as wood siding instead of masses of uninterrupted stucco on the 
front of the house, glass blocks in the bathroom (I am not about to spend 
$100,000 on a home remodel that does not include glass blocks) and French doors 
in the master bedroom. In return, we agreed to drop our demands for a skylight 
and an arch-shaped window. Frank dislikes all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, we were shaking hands and smiling. We will soon release a joint 
communique to contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The world looks different to us now. 
</P>
<P>
We used to drive past houses and think: "Nice house." We used to walk into 
friends' homes and think: "cozy place." And let it go at that. No more. 
</P>
<P>
Now, every house is a collection of discrete, identifiable elements. We see 
roof lines and eaves, landscaping, window placement, siding and brick work. We 
study the setback, we ponder whether the add-on was built with a permit. We 
frown at the tacky walled-in patios that pass for family rooms. We check out 
color schemes and evaluate curb appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Indoors, we have begun to notice floor plans: Are they logical and functional? 
Do they work with household traffic patterns? We eye window treatments, door 
frames, flooring. 
</P>
<P>
We mentally price out the bathrooms, fixture by fixture. We take in the 
wainscotting, the wallpaper, the crown moldings, the round corners and diagonal 
accents. The paneling, the lighting, the energy efficiency and the way sunlight 
plays through the windows. 
</P>
<P>
At last, it is time to stop pondering and start choosing. The long series of 
decisions has begun. 
</P>
<P>
Our drawings are nearly complete now. So my husband and I must pick out 
materials, beginning with the bathtub, which gets installed early in 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
We looked at bathtubs one day recently. One was priced at about $26,000 (that 
is not a typo). You could phone this tub from the office and have it run your 
bath and keep it at just the right temperature, chill your wine, turn on your 
stereo and unlock the door for you. I am not making this up. 
</P>
<P>
We are thinking of something slightly more modest. Our only requirements are 
that our bathtub must hold two people and it must have jets, since a deck and 
hot tub never made it into the plans. So we are looking at a mere $3,000 or so 
for a tub and faucet. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, it is a lot easier for me to shrug off a $100,000 increase in debt 
than to accept that a bathtub is going to cost (gulp) $3,000. And a smallish, 
unfancy one at that. 
</P>
<P>
The bank, meanwhile, agreed to hold on to our loan for another couple of 
months, since it became clear that construction could not start anywhere near 
when we had hoped. Ultimately, we refinanced for $250,000, with an optional 
$25,000 line of credit in addition. Our total payments turned out to be smaller 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
But oh, those payments. Our cute baby has watched me pore over loan documents. 
When panic overcomes me, he erupts with giggles. He thinks it is hilarious the 
way Mommy suddenly goes wide-eyed, shakes her fists and screeches. Now my 
2-year-old declares a "pan-attack" several times a day. We both wave our fists 
and screech. It is cathartic beyond words. Every home should have a 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
So almost everything is in place; we are poised for our leap into the abyss of 
home improvement. Will our cute house grow into a grand showplace, a nice 
functional family home, or a nightmare? 
</P>
<P>
Watch this space.

UNDERSTANDING THE PRESSURES ON APPRAISERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is in response to Robert Bruss' response to "Don't Accept Appraisal 
That You Don't Like" (Aug. 20). It is true that a borrower can request an 
additional appraisal. But that is where the truth ends. 
</P>
<P>
Appraisers are not instructed to appraise conservatively. It is just the 
opposite. Appraisers are under tremendous pressure to meet sales prices and 
owners' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
This presure is put on appraisers by loan brokers, real estate brokers and 
agents, and loan agents. To an independent fee appraiser, the threat is: "If 
you don't bring the value in, you won't get any more work." To a staff 
appraiser, the threat is: "Don't rock the boat, don't make waves, bring the 
value in, we are here to make loans." 
</P>
<P>
Bruss does not appear to understand what an appraisal is or the restraints put 
on the appraiser by the different government and quasi-government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
An appraisal is an opinion of value. Appraisers are required to adhere to 
extensive rules and parameters set by these agencies. Most conventional lenders 
require that closed sale comparables are used to base the value on. This means 
that appraisers are using historical data, not current escrows, to base their 
opinion on. 
</P>
<P>
In a rapidly appreciating real estate market, it is often difficult to support 
sales prices using these closed sales. These rules are not set by the 
appraisers. These rules were developed to protect the banks and savings and 
loans. Finally, if you have a complaint, complain to the Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board, FNMA FHMLC or to your congressperson. We are tired of hearing your 
whining.

FIXING BRIDGES, PASADENA RESTORES LINKS TO PAST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Concrete falls off the bridge in chunks. Steel rods twist out and away from the 
gray mass they supposedly support. Rain seeps through cracks, and the sidewalk 
crumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it's the Colorado Street Bridge -- and a handful of other city-owned 
bridges -- showing desperate signs of aging. 
</P>
<P>
A $3.7-million allocation given last week by the county Department of 
Transportation will enable Pasadena to undertake a $20.4-million rehabilitation 
of its famous landmark bridge spanning the Arroyo Seco. 
</P>
<P>
But the project is only the most well-known in the city's ongoing battle to 
preserve about 20 automobile and five pedestrian bridges, most of them more 
than 50 years old. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Than Typical' 
</P>
<P>
"Pasadena has a lot of city-owned bridges, more than is typical in most 
Southern California cities," said City Engineer Dave Barnhart. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the city has spent or budgeted more than $7 million for 
work on eight bridges listed as high-priority projects in the city's capital 
improvement program. 
</P>
<P>
The work has included: placing boulders under the Oak Grove Drive bridge to 
prevent rushing water from undermining the foundations; completely demolishing 
the shaky La Canada-Verdugo timber bridge, and replastering the top of the 
Columbia Street Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Another project -- the rebuilding of the 1911 Prospect Boulevard Bridge, which 
was closed for eight years before it was demolished in 1984 -- warranted a 
neighborhood celebration and television coverage by CBS News when it was 
completed last May. 
</P>
<P>
"When the bridge was closed, there was no way to get from one side of the 
arroyo to the other," said Marilynne Kennedy, president of the East Arroyo 
Residents Assn. "It really separated the neighborhood . . . . Now, I think 
people are glad we have been reunited." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arroyo Seco and Eaton Wash 
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's bridges are tucked away along the Arroyo Seco, which bisects 
Pasadena's residential neighborhoods on the west. Others span Eaton Wash on the 
city's west side. Like the Colorado Street Bridge, they are 
concrete-reinforced, arched bridges, familiar to residents who take evening 
walks beneath them or zip across in autos to reach home. 
</P>
<P>
Most were built between 1900 and 1910, a time when immigration tripled the 
population in Los Angeles and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"There was very much of a booster policy in that period and on into the 1920s," 
said Ann Scheid, a local historian and author of "Pasadena: Crown of the 
Valley." "They developed scenic roads for tourists, creating a network of 
roads." 
</P>
<P>
Architects also took advantage of the newest technology to build modern, 
reinforced concrete bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the city is committed to preserving the old bridges. Every year, they are 
inspected by the county Public Works Department and the city devises a priority 
list for repairs. Pasadena street maintenance crews do minor work and simple 
patching. More extensive jobs are awarded to contractors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Architecturally Distinct 
</P>
<P>
The Colorado Street Bridge is the most well known of the city's bridges, in 
part, because of its architectural distinction. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was built, it was considered avant-garde . . . the highest concrete 
bridge in the world," said Claire Bogaard of Pasadena Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 workers built the bridge in 18 months, hauling equipment and 
cement on mules down the steep sides of the arroyo. Concrete was poured half a 
yard at a time to fill in the bridge's 11 parabolic arches. 
</P>
<P>
Three men fell to their deaths from the top of the bridge during its 
construction. Bogaard said the accident sparked a tale, completely untrue, that 
the three workers plunged into the concrete pillars to be buried there forever. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Funding 
</P>
<P>
The bridge was opened on Dec. 13, 1913, with a caravan of bunting-bedecked cars 
and a celebration attended by 3,000 people. But by 1934, it was considered 
obsolete. A letter-writing campaign by concerned residents saved it from 
demolition in 1951 and a second campaign, which was begun 12 years ago, 
resulted in the current preservation effort. 
</P>
<P>
That effort will be funded with $12.7 million from the Federal Highway 
Administration, which agreed last year to provide 80% of the bridge 
rehabilitation costs. Pasadena was to make up the difference. But the city's 
share mushroomed when design work was finally completed and inflation increased 
the projected cost from $15.8 million to $20.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government was unwilling to provide any more money. In an unusual 
step, Pasadena appealed to the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, 
which on Aug. 23 agreed to advance Pasadena $3.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will be paid back out of future regional transportation funds 
and additional taxes on roads. 
</P>
<P>
Requests for construction bids will be issued later this year. Barnhart is 
keeping his fingers crossed, hoping that the city's new estimates match that of 
construction companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Restoration 
</P>
<P>
"If the bids, God forbid, do come in high, we would go back and see if certain 
elements can be reduced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Work planned for the bridge is extensive. It will require closure of the bridge 
for 2 1/2 years while the entire top structure supporting the roadway is 
removed and then replaced. The 11 arches will be stripped down to their steel 
skeleton and refilled. The pillars resting on the arroyo floor will be scraped 
of old concrete to a depth of six inches and new concrete will be poured. 
</P>
<P>
The finished product will not only meet current bridge construction codes but 
will be more historically accurate. Over time the bridge had been altered from 
its original design. 
</P>
<P>
Concrete urns, which once graced the bridge, will be duplicated. The 48 lamp 
posts, each with a single bulb, will be restored to their original design: a 
large lamp on top and four smaller bulbs suspended from cast-iron arms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paint Chip Analysis 
</P>
<P>
Even the paint on the lamp posts will be historically accurate. Laboratory 
analysis of paint chips still remaining on the posts indicate the bridge 
originally was painted battleship gray so the restored bridge will be painted 
that color once again. 
</P>
<P>
There will be some contemporary touches added to the renovated bridge. The 
1950s-era safety railing will be revamped to produce less of a tunnel effect 
and concrete barriers will be built at the curb line. 
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation goes far beyond the city's regular bridge maintenance 
program and represents the work of preservationists and nonpreservationists 
alike, Barnhart said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people and agencies joined forces to save this beautiful old bridge," 
he said.

PICTURING CALIFORNIA; 
</P>
<P>
A QUICK TRIP THROUGH A CENTURY OF LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY 
</P>

<P>
"EVERYTHING WORTH PHOTOGRAPHING is in California," Edward Weston once wrote, 
sweeping away all the other states with typical decisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The first professional photographers who brought their cameras to California 
were employed, for the most part, by a government survey team or by a railroad 
company. They were hired to make a visual record of natural resources, and of 
planned routes of transportation, but the landscape was so spectacular that 
they couldn't resist doing some free-lancing on the side. California was still 
a frontier, in the process of being settled, and the demand for images of it 
was high. What the public craved most was a demonstration of the new 
territory's superior scale and its open space. Mountain ranges, cataracts, a 
glittering expanse of sky: in essence, the Big Picture, a precursor of special 
effects and 70mm film. It's no accident that human beings were often portrayed 
as a dwarf species, posed in front of redwoods, or on a precipice overlooking a 
gorge. 
</P>
<P>
It was common in those days for a photographer to manipulate nature for 
aesthetic reasons. One pioneer, Carleton Watkins, routinely dug up ugly stumps 
with his spade. In his studio, the eccentric Englishman Eadweard Muybridge 
fiddled with the look of clouds; in the field, he cut down trees by the score. 
It's tempting to accuse these photographers of cheating, but it wouldn't be 
fair. They were just trying to manufacture a sense of wonder that corresponded 
to their own. Without a human being to act as its filter, a camera can be too 
cold, too analytical. With some judicious tinkering, a gifted photographer 
could mask nature's imperfections and create a much grander (and much more 
marketable) version of the mountains. In terms of photography, then, we should 
admit that California has always been something of a fiction, right from the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
ANSEL ADAMS' FIRST CAMERA was a Kodak No. 1 Brownie. He got it for his 14th 
birthday, in 1916, and took it along on a family vacation to Yosemite, where he 
discovered a subject that was complex and sublime enough to occupy him for a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, Adams would repeat the journey of Watkins and the other 
pioneers, but he had different problems to solve. California wilderness wasn't 
virgin territory anymore. By 1920, there were cars, tour buses and gift shops 
in Yosemite Valley, and a photographer had to cut through 50 years of 
platitudes, poetry and snapshots to find an original vision. For Adams, this 
meant lots of waiting, sometimes in storms, sometimes in zero-degree weather. 
He did not crop or retouch his pictures, so he had to get them exactly right. 
He was making, rather than recording, an image, isolating an indispensable view 
from the clutter of disposable ones. More than anything, he tried to be 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Adams and another California photographer, 
Edward Weston, were at the forefront of landscape photography in the West. 
Weston discovered patterns in the land, drawing the viewer's eye to the 
feminine curve of a hill against the flat surface of a bay, to a swatch of bark 
that had the texture of recently tilled ground. Both photographers influenced 
how Californians felt about the mountains and the coast. For both men, nature 
was an article of faith, and they labored to show it simply, cleanly and 
sympathetically. They had intelligence and moral purpose, and this gives their 
pictures a quality of affirmation, even though human beings are so often 
missing from the frame. 
</P>
<P>
Where did all the people go? Some critics didn't approve of their absence, most 
notably the French photojournalist Henri Cartier-Bresson. The world was falling 
apart, he said, and Adams and Weston just took photos of rocks. Their interest, 
they might have argued, was in the timeless, the eternal; they were pursuing 
symmetry and order, not suffering and pain. 
</P>
<P>
An attitude like that wouldn't do for Dorothea Lange. She couldn't pass by a 
scrap of land without registering its political implications. Her tendency was 
to include, not to exclude. "Bad as it is, the world is potentially full of 
good photographs," she once said. "But to be good, photographs must be full of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, Lange was drawn into a commitment to the disadvantaged. She began 
a collaboration with an economics professor named Paul Taylor, doing reports 
for state relief agencies and then for the federal Farm Service Administration. 
Lange produced her famous photographs of migrant workers, tar-paper shacks and 
disposessed families. In her pictures, the land frequently has elements of 
beauty, but the beauty is about to be compromised, exploited or stripped bare. 
</P>
<P>
BY THE 1950S IN LOS ANGELES, real estate speculators were buying up the orange 
groves, and paved roads ran everywhere. The Los Angeles basin was becoming a 
metropolis, with little boxes from Silver Lake to Orange County, and almost 
every trace of its past, including its topographical history, was being erased. 
</P>
<P>
Was it possible to find beauty in a suburban landscape? Some people didn't 
think so, and they turned away their cameras, concentrating instead on the 
unspoiled, unoccupied natural world that had captivated Adams and Weston. But 
more than a quarter of a century had gone by since those initial acts of 
attention, and such photos now seemed anti-modern, a step backward. 
</P>
<P>
There were other methods of dealing with the suburbs, though, that yielded 
intriguing new pictures. If a photographer climbed to a hillside overlooking 
the San Fernando Valley and took a shot of the spiraling tracts, he might 
discover patterns as intricate, and sometimes as lovely, as those that Weston 
found on Point Lobos. Such a photo is unexpected and robs us of our 
preconceptions; it isn't about suburbia in any obvious way. The same is true of 
certain images in color, which substitute a sweep of pastel blues, greens and 
golds for any opinions or data about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
As the uses of land in California become more diverse, so do our ways of 
responding to it. The simple act of using, rather than respecting or honoring, 
pushes us ever further from our early notion of the West as a place of 
boundless promise. A new kind of scenery begins to emerge, one that seems to 
celebrate clutter and tolerate trash, so that a drive along any rural highway 
in the state combines views of utter splendor with vignettes of environmental 
woe. The closing down of space is also the closing down of possibility, and we 
can feel the open, embracing mood of the 19th Century swing toward pessimism 
and irony. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of bad news, people sometimes get the giggles, and there's been 
plenty of giggling in recent photography. A palm tree isn't just part of a 
desert ecology anymore; it's a piece of furniture for a stage set, trucked to 
L.A. and deposited on the grounds of a hotel. Human beings are no longer a 
dwarf species. They spoil pictures by casting shadows and they invent domestic 
environments (gardens, patios, pool-side cabanas) where they can be in control. 
</P>
<P>
In Roger Minick's photo, a woman in a brown overcoat stands at an overlook in 
Yosemite National Park and gazes out at a vista that appears not to have 
changed in 150 years. The woman fills the frame, inverting the standard 
perspective of the 19th Century. On her head, she wears a souvenir kerchief 
imprinted with a dime-store picture of the scenery she's so raptly studying. 
The ironies are multiple, but the one that strikes closest to home is that we 
may have finally succeeded in turning nature into something merely decorative. 
</P>
<P>
We have come full circle, then, from the days when a landscape consisted of a 
foreground, a middle ground, a background and a sky. Now, photographers appear 
to share only an uncertain attitude toward the future, and the fictional 
versions of California continue to multiply.

<P>
DARRELL WALTRIP IS ENJOYING QUEST FOR $1-MILLION BONUS IN TODAY'S SOUTHERN 500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DARLINGTON, S.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Darrell Waltrip won his first race when he was 17, on a three-eighths-mile dirt 
track in Owensboro, Ky., driving a 1936 Chevy coupe. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I won a case of beer," Waltrip recalled. "And I'm sure I drank it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Today, in the Heinz Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway, Waltrip, now 42, will 
drive another Chevrolet, a 1990 Lumina, on a 1.366-mile egg-shaped asphalt 
track. If he wins, he will collect a $1-million bonus that will increase his 
racing earnings to more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
How does he feel about the race? 
</P>
<P>
That question has been repeatedly asked of the three-time Winston Cup champion 
since he won the Coca-Cola World 600 at Charlotte, N.C., last May and became 
eligible for the Winston Million bonus offered for winning three of NASCAR's 
big four races in a single season. 
</P>
<P>
"Like a million dollars," he always replies, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Bill Elliott, who was ill at ease and became reclusive when he and his 
Ford Thunderbird were chasing a similar bonus in 1985, Waltrip seems to be 
relishing the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come down here this week to be part of the show," he said. "I came 
down here to be the show." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, one would have to think that way to perform in a fluorescent orange, 
yellow and white uniform that makes him look like a 6-foot box of detergent. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he planned to hire bodyguards to protect him and his car in the garage 
area today, as Elliott did, Waltrip laughed and said, "I'll hire the bodyguards 
after I win the million dollars. That's when I'll need them. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm having a million dollars' worth of fun trying to win the million." 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip, in 16 tries, has never won the Southern 500, but he notes that he had 
never won the Daytona 500 before this year, either. It was his victory at 
Daytona, followed by the one at Charlotte, that put him in position to become 
the second recipient of the $1 million offered by the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. 
</P>
<P>
He insists that he won't do anything different than he would under normal 
circumstances. At least until the white-flag lap, when there are only four 
turns remaining in the 367-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can get out quickly and run strong, we can dictate our own destiny," he 
said. "This race track is a lot easier when you're out in front, so we'll try 
to get to the front as quickly as possible and maintain our position." 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip will start ninth, a bit farther back than he had hoped for, but the 
same place he started from last Saturday night when he won the Busch 500 at 
Bristol, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid to run my car hard," he said. "I have enough confidence in the 
engine going the whole 500 that I won't hold back. Like I said, the front is 
the safest and most comfortable place to be at Darlington and we expect to get 
up there and then see what happens. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't go out and throw caution to the wind in a banzai effort because if we 
miss the first million, we don't want to jeopardize our chances of getting the 
other million." 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Winston Cup champion will receive $1 million at the NASCAR awards 
banquet next January in New York. 
</P>
<P>
With nine races remaining, including today's, Waltrip is in fourth place, 141 
points behind Dale Earnhardt, 98 behind Rusty Wallace and 23 behind Mark 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some ups and downs this year, but we're not out of it by a long 
shot," Waltrip said. "In '85, we left Darlington with Elliott holding a 
206-point lead and we caught him. 
</P>
<P>
"At Darlington that year, he was thinking Winston Million and we were thinking 
Winston Cup championship. We both got our wishes, but we don't want to screw up 
our chances for both millions this year in one race. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll need some luck, just like Elliott had here when he won. He didn't have 
the best car by a long way and he almost got in a couple of wrecks. Cale 
(Yarborough) had him beat. And then Cale's power steering went out. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things happened that allowed him to win, and we'll need the same good 
fortune. From the way we qualified, we certainly don't have a dominant car, but 
we think we have a competitive car that will be able to race, keep up, get in 
and out of the pits quick and be ready at the end of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"That is what's going to be so important, that last lap. Anything can happen 
then. I know." 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip was leading on the last lap of the Winston, a gimmick race for 1988 
race winners, when he was rear-ended by Wallace, spinning him out of the lead 
and the race and allowing Wallace to take the checkered flag and $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The incident led to fisticuffs between the Waltrip and Wallace crews, and 
Waltrip said he hoped that Wallace "chokes on that $200,000 because he knows he 
knocked the hell out of me." 
</P>
<P>
Several days later, the drivers apologized to one another, Waltrip for his 
comments and Wallace for his track actions. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had this recurring nightmare the last few weeks," Waltrip said. "I was on 
the white flag lap here at Darlington and the only car ahead of me was Rusty's. 
When I tried to pass him, I spun him into the infield and went on to win the 
race and the million bucks. 
</P>
<P>
"The nightmare is wondering how I was going to convince everyone that it was 
just a racing accident, that I didn't do it on purpose. I really didn't, you 
know. Now, are you going to believe that? 
</P>
<P>
"I've thought of hundreds of scenarios for the finish, but I pray and hope that 
it doesn't come down to Rusty and me all by ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip said he had Wallace to thank, however, for a change in stock car fans' 
attitude toward him. Before he was bumped by Wallace, Waltrip had long been the 
target of boos when he was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the boos have changed to cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe my ears when I heard them cheering my name after that," he 
said. "I never dreamed they'd ever be on my side." 
</P>
<P>
One thing Waltrip is certain of is that none of the 38 other drivers in today's 
Southern 500 will make his task any easier. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a soul in that garage area who would back off and let me win that 
million, not even my brother Mike," Waltrip said. "I know, because my mama 
already asked him. 
</P>
<P>
"The other drivers' attitude toward me will be affected by how I'm driving. If 
they see me driving hard, getting the most out of the car and it's running good 
and we're somebody with a chance to win, the guys will respect our position. 
They won't give way, but they'll be considerate. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, if I'm dragging around, not running very well and look like 
I'm waiting for something to happen to the other guys, no one will give us a 
break. And I wouldn't, either." 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip won four races early in the season and then seemed to slump, going for 
nine more without a victory before last week's triumph at Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
"Things seem to go in cycles for us," he said. "We have a couple of good races 
and then we fall back. I think we gained a lot by winning the way we did at 
Bristol, beating everyone good. 
</P>
<P>
"Bristol and Darlington are similar in that both are difficult tracks. We were 
able to get the right combination and run hard at Bristol and I hope we'll do 
the same here." 
</P>
<P>
If Waltrip fails to win, he still gets a $100,000 prize for having won two of 
the four big races. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we look at it, we can't lose," he said. "We're in Darlington to do our 
job running the Southern 500, just like always. If we win, that's what we're 
here for, then the bonus would be just that, a bonus. A real nice one, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like if you were selling cars, and your boss said he'd give you a big 
bonus for selling 25 cars in a month and you only sold 24. You wouldn't get the 
bonus, but you'd still have a darn good month. 
</P>
<P>
"If we run second in the Southern 500, that would be a great day. It wouldn't 
get us the million, but we wouldn't lose anything. And I'll tell you one thing 
-- we're the only ones with a shot at it, and that's a tremendous feeling in 
itself."

JIM MURRAY: RANDOLPH CLEAN-UP INFIELDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Willie Randolph bustled busily into the locker room. Willie Randolph always 
looks busy, a man with a mission. He doesn't walk, he darts. He acts like a man 
who expects a tough day at the office. 
</P>
<P>
He surveyed his locker. It was as neat as a chairman of the board's. Some 
ballplayers' lockers look as if a typhoon just went through. Willie's looks as 
if the janitor just went through. 
</P>
<P>
His shoes have a high polish on them. His uniform gleams white. Willie himself 
always looks as if he just stepped out of the shower. No one can ever remember 
his needing a shave. He wears a shirt and tie. He'd look right at home on Wall 
Street. He seldom raises his voice or gets alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
He keeps second base as neat as he is. You'd think second base was the 18th 
green at Augusta. There are never any loose baseballs leaking around the bag 
when Randolph is there. He landscapes it with his spikes as carefully as if he 
were lining up an 18-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph, like Maury Wills, never does anything without a purpose. You 
see him now as he goes over a check list to get ready for the night's game. A 
reporter wants a few minutes of his time. Willie glances at his watch. OK, he 
has a few minutes to spare. Then, it's into the training room, out on the 
field, stretching exercises, preparation for the evening's encounter with the 
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Willie is as programmed as an English butler. Some ballplayers wander around a 
locker room in disarray, as aimlessly as refugees. Not Willie. He acts as if he 
has barely enough time to do what has to be done. 
</P>
<P>
A fly wouldn't light on him. You get the feeling that if Randolph had to slide 
into a base head first, he'd call time to get his shirt changed. And his shoes 
shined. Willie doesn't like to look sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
He plays baseball with the same deft, conscientious attention to detail. You 
get nine innings of impeccable baseball out of Willie Randolph night after 
night. Your money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
In the field, Randolph never seems to stretch or strain or anything frantic. He 
glides. When the ball gets there, he's there. Second base is taken care of. Let 
'em hit it. 
</P>
<P>
Not too many people playing the game today have something in common with Lou 
Gehrig. Willie Randolph does. They were both captains of the Yankees. Gehrig 
was the first. Randolph was the eighth. It is the measure of the esteem with 
which he is held by those who play with him. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers need no reminder. Fans rejoice when their teams sign the 
well-publicized sluggers, the fence-breakers. Pitchers shrug. Pitchers want the 
guys who will turn the double play when they make the batter hit their pitch -- 
the low-and-away breaking ball that will be hit on the ground. Tommy John once 
told a reporter that he signed with the Yankees when he left the Dodgers 
because he had Graig Nettles and Willie Randolph to make sure his good pitches 
became outs. 
</P>
<P>
"I throw ground balls for a living," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
If the public overlooks good fielding, pitchers don't. A .300 hitter may win 
one game for a pitcher a season. A sure-handed fielder can win 20. Randolph 
couldn't play his position any better on roller skates. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he has never won a Gold Glove. He twice led the league in double plays 
turned, and in 1979 led the league in chances with 846. He made only seven 
errors all last year and had made only five in his first 110 games this year. 
</P>
<P>
He is as finicky about pitches as he is about his shirt collars. He is second 
on the team in bases on balls. Pitchers walk Eddie Murray because they're 
scared of him. Pitchers walk Willie Randolph because he makes them. 
</P>
<P>
The last thing they want to do is walk Willie Randolph. He has stolen 257 
bases. Still, he has walked 1,075 times in his career. If you don't think 
that's a lot, consider that Henry Aaron walked only 1,402 times in his 23-year 
career. And Henry hit 755 home runs. Randolph is 706 behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph led the American League in walks in 1980. He swings at strikes. And 
usually hits them. He struck out only 24 times one year, only 25 another. 
</P>
<P>
When he came over from New York to replace Steve Sax, the best guess in town 
was that he would be booed. Saxie was L.A.'s pet. 
</P>
<P>
But nobody boos Willie Randolph. What's to boo? He shows up on time. He's ready 
to play. He's as fastidious as a scrub nurse, as meticulous as a surgeon. Even 
in the rubber room that is Yankee Stadium, Randolph kept his dignity. 
</P>
<P>
"George (Steinbrenner) and I had our troubles," he acknowledges. "But I always 
figured his office door was open and we could close it and discuss the matter." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner was more used to employees who took their grievances to the 11 
o'clock news, not to him. But that was not Randolph's style. 
</P>
<P>
What no one had to worry about was that he would have trouble adjusting to a 
new double-play partner. Over the years, Randolph has played with 31 
shortstops, including such memorable ones as Jim Mason, Luis Aguayo and Fred 
Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
"Alfredo Griffin is a joy," he says. "He plays the position the way it should 
be played." 
</P>
<P>
So, you have to think, does Willie Randolph. The Dodgers are third in club 
fielding with his glove in there. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph's job is to get on base (192 times, second on the team), score runs 
(second on the team in that) and make sure the other team never gets four outs 
an inning. He does that as well as anyone in the league. And he doesn't even 
spit.

Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said that "Big Red Confidential: Inside Nebraska 
Football" -- a book that reviews the problems of the Cornhusker football 
program over the past eight years -- is not all bad. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne said that author Armen Keteyian and a 1986 National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. investigation have failed to implicate the school's coaching staff or 
administration in any wrongdoing.

The 1989 high school football season began with a prayer despite a U.S. Supreme 
Court ruling upholding a ban on such invocations in three Southern states. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dub Polson of Marfa, Tex., said before Friday's game against a team from 
Eunice, N.M.: "As long as we're supposed to be a God-fearing nation, I think 
we'll always have a prayer." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court in May refused to review an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals ruling that banned organized prayer before football games in Florida, 
Georgia and Alabama. The court ruled that organized prayers delivered over a 
public address system violated the constitutional amendment requiring 
separation of church and state.

<P>
The Florida State tailback said he came down $200,000 this week, from $2.95 
million for a four-year contract, and also was willing to take a three-year 
contract, but Miami rejected both offers, he said. The team's final offer was 
$2.45 million.

Junior Brad Gossen completed 17 of 22 passes for 288 yards and three touchdowns 
in his first start, and Washington State held Idaho scoreless after the first 
quarter as the Cougars defeated the Vandals, 41-7, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Gossen directed the Cougars on four scoring drives that covered 
at least 80 yards and took less than three minutes each. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, leading, 17-7, midway through the third quarter, were backed up 
inside their own one-yard line by a punt and an illegal motion penalty. But 
Gossen passed to tight end Doug Wellsandt for a 28-yard gain to get out of the 
hole, then threw over the middle to senior flanker Tim Stallworth, who 
completed a 62-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars' Steve Broussard was bottled up by Idaho's defense most of the 
first half but finished with 115 yards in 23 carries and also had a four-yard 
scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
Idaho's John Friesz completed 19 of 32 passes for 225 yards and threw two 
interceptions.

DRIVERS DON'T LIKE DARLINGTON TRACK, BUT THEY RESPECT IT

<P>
I grew up thinking that the Southern 500 was about as important as the World 
Series, Kentucky Derby and the Indianapolis 500, all wrapped up into one. -- 
Richard Petty 
</P>
<P>
The Lady in Black, who will turn 39 today, is showing no signs of getting soft 
in her old age. 
</P>
<P>
Darlington Raceway, carved from a South Carolina cotton field in 1950 as the 
first banked superspeedway in motor racing, has always had a strange sort of an 
egg-shaped figure that has puzzled and tantalized the world's greatest stock 
car drivers for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
The track is so narrow and its turns so out of balance that frustrated drivers 
began calling it the Lady in Black, in keeping with its dangerous character. 
More recently, since the France family obtained control of the facility in 
1982, it has been called, "The Track Too Tough to Tame." 
</P>
<P>
The 40th annual Southern 500 will be run today on the lopsided 1.366-mile 
circuit, and today's drivers, Darrell Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt, Geoff Bodine, 
seem as much in awe of Darlington as did those of an earlier era, Curtis 
Turner, Fireball Robert, Junior Johnson and a young Richard Petty. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk around the old track and see how narrow it is and you think there's 
no way to race," Waltrip says. "Then you go out and do it." 
</P>
<P>
Says Bodine: "Darlington is so treacherous that even when you're warming up, 
you have the feeling that you might spin out at half-speed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Lady in Black all right. That long stretch of black asphalt 
shimmering in the heat can do strange things to your head. Sometimes you'll be 
coming out of a turn and you'll swear you see an oil slick. It's just the Lady 
in Black playing tricks on your mind." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Kulwicki, who will start on the pole today after qualifying at 160.156 
m.p.h., likens driving here to a video racing game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like where you're driving along and all these obstacles jump up at you on 
the screen," Kulwicki says. "Darlington's a lot like that. You had better drive 
defensively because you never know just what'll jump up next. You can be sure 
that it will be something, though." 
</P>
<P>
David Pearson, the retired Silver Fox from Spartanburg, S.C., has been the most 
successful driver here, having won 10 races and 12 pole positions. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes patience, prudence and tolerance to race at Darlington," Pearson 
says. "Common sense should dictate your moves. It's a real accomplishment just 
to finish a race here. 
</P>
<P>
"The track is so narrow and tight that you can't be too cautious in passing, 
even lapped cars. I've spent as many as 10 laps following a car that was 
decidedly slower than mine before I'd attempt a pass because I was afraid I 
might wreck us both. 
</P>
<P>
"This old place is just as fickle as everybody says it is." 
</P>
<P>
Junior Johnson, who has one victory as a driver and eight as a car owner, 
mourns for the days when the Southern 500 was the belle of NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of sad, sort of, that some of the young guys don't have the same 
feeling for Darlington that the old-timers have," Johnson says. "Nowadays, 
there are races that pay more, are faster and longer. But for folks who were 
around when all this started, there is a special feeling for this track and 
this race. 
</P>
<P>
"The newcomers, drivers and car owners, don't seem to have the same respect for 
it that we have. I remember when it was the most awesome event of our time. If 
you captured this race, it was like you'd whupped the king, as far as we were 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip, who drove for Johnson for six years before switching to Rick Hendrick 
three years ago, has similar feelings even though he was only 3 when the track 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
"All you've got to do is just be here to feel history all around you," Waltrip 
says. "Over there in the fourth turn is where Richard (Petty) flipped in '70, 
and over there is where Cale (Yarborough) went out of the ballpark in '65, and 
you can't see it today but over where that concrete is in the east turn is 
where the Darlington stripe got its name." 
</P>
<P>
The Darlington stripe evolved when drivers -- some say it was Red Byron who 
first did it in his Cadillac in the early 1950s -- discovered that if the rear 
ends of their cars hit the guard rail between the third and fourth turns, it 
increased their lap speeds. Consequently, car owners and fans could tell who 
were the bravest -- and fastest -- drivers by looking at the cars' right rear 
fenders. 
</P>
<P>
If a car had a bare spot there, it was where the paint had been scrubbed off by 
the guard rail. That was the badge of courage that became known as the 
Darlington stripe. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could put roller skates on the side of my car, the turn would be 
perfect," Fireball Roberts once said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, though, the turn was widened and in 1974 the guard rail was replaced 
by a concrete barrier and the Darlington stripe became a legend of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Darlington Raceway did not open until Labor Day, 1950, but the idea for an 
Indianapolis of the South had been germinating in Harold Brasington's mind 
since 1933. Brasington, a Darlington contractor and devoted fan of Carolina 
dirt-track racing, had seen the Indianapolis 500 that year and felt that the 
South would welcome a similar facility for late model stock cars. 
</P>
<P>
Up until then, outside of the race on the beach at Daytona, there were no 
tracks where stock cars ran that were longer than a mile and all of them were 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
By 1949 Brasington had made enough money so that, with the help of several 
cronies, he set out to build a paved track on some farmland west of the tiny 
South Carolina farming community, out alongside Hartsville Highway. 
</P>
<P>
As Brasington was bulldozing his track, though, he encountered a problem. It 
seemed that one of the landowners, who had traded 70 acres of cropland for 
shares in the new track, also had a minnow pond on the property -- and it was 
right in the path of Brasington's track. 
</P>
<P>
The minnows were used as fishing bait and fishing had been a way of life on the 
Carolina Piedmont during the Depression years. 
</P>
<P>
No problem. The configuration of the original 1 1/4-mile track was changed to 
accommodate the pond, which remains just a few yards from the southwest turn. 
</P>
<P>
The result was that the first and second turns were pinched closer together 
than the more sweeping third and fourth turns. Drivers, mechanics and engineers 
have been trying to live with that situation ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like running a road course set-up on an oval," says Rusty Wallace. "You 
get the car balanced for (Turns) 1 and 2 and you're completely off for 3 and 4. 
Or the other way around. You've got to find a compromise, and then you've got 
to keep your car off the walls. It's a devil to drive." 
</P>
<P>
There is barely room enough for cars to drive two abreast on the two long 
1,200-foot straightaways, much less in the oddly-banked turns. The banking is 
22 degrees through the first and second turns and 24 degrees on the other end 
of the track. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted banking that would give us speeds of 75 to 100 m.p.h.," Brasington 
once said -- a statement often ridiculed today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going 160 on a track built for 100," says Richard Petty, who won the 
1967 Southern 500 but has lost some of his enthusiasm regarding Darlington 
since his accident in 1970. "That's not too smart, running 1990 speeds on a 
1950 track. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather race most anywhere than Darlington. I have no love for the race 
track, but plenty of respect. The thing rose up and bit me in 1970." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Petty will be making his 30th appearance in the Southern 500. 
</P>
<P>
The first Southern 500, although it wasn't called that until a few years later, 
was won by Californian Johnny Mantz, who drove a Plymouth that he, Bill France, 
Curtis Turner and Alvin Hawkins had used to run errands. Mantz, an Indianapolis 
500 veteran, had expected to land a ride in one of the top cars in the 
fledgling NASCAR camp but when he didn't, he decided to drive the store-bought 
passenger car. 
</P>
<P>
Mantz won after nearly all the favorites had dropped out with blown tires or 
blown engines. He averaged 76 m.p.h. in a race that lasted more than 6 1/2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, today's race should last less than four hours. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that has changed little is the crowd -- a sweltering mob loaded down 
with beer, Confederate flags and Johnny Reb hats that will spill out from the 
more than 40,000 seats and pack the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Brasington was hoping that 5,000 spectators would show up for his first Labor 
Day race and the result was overwhelming as closer to 25,000 jammed the narrow 
winding roads from all over the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
There are 45,000 grandstand seats now, and with an additional 20,000 people 
jammed in the infield, the crowd is expected to reach 65,000. Brasington, who 
no longer is associated with the track, is still promoting, however. He runs 
Darlington International Dragway, about five miles from his old track, and next 
Saturday will have the International Hot Rod Assn.'s U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
For nine years, Darlington was the only superspeedway in NASCAR. Then Daytona 
was built in 1959 and the flood gates opened for tracks such as Charlotte, 
Atlanta, Rockingham and, later, Talladega. 
</P>
<P>
When the Frances' International Speedway Corp. bought the Darlington facility 
for $4.5 million, it set about to upgrade the track and grounds -- but not to 
tamper with the track. "We'll continue to make improvements from race to race, 
but we have no intention of altering the racing surface," said Jimmy France, 
executive vice president of ISC and youngest son of Bill France, the founder of 
NASCAR. "That is tradition we won't tamper with." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Waltrip says: "No one would dare touch up the Mona Lisa. The track at 
Darlington shouldn't be tampered with either." 
</P>
<P>
The one thing different this year is the race's official name -- the Heinz 
Southern 500. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with a trend toward corporate sponsorship of major sporting events, 
Darlington Raceway signed a three-year agreement last June with the 
Pittsburgh-based food products company. This leaves only two of the 29 Winston 
Cup races without commercial names -- the Daytona 500 and the Charlotte 500.

HOSPITAL: A CRISIS IN CRITICAL CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old girl was rushed to the hospital in December after a bullet fired 
from a passing car tore through her neck, pierced her jawbone, lacerated her 
tongue and blinded her in one eye. 
</P>
<P>
But when she arrived at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Watts, 
her ordeal was not over. In surgery, trauma doctors mistakenly slit her throat. 
</P>
<P>
Both jugular veins were cut, causing a massive hemorrhage in what was described 
by one physician who later reviewed the case as a "botched" attempt to open a 
small airway for her to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Therapeutic Misadventure' 
</P>
<P>
The girl eventually recovered -- unlike another patient, Betty Jo Mack, 37, who 
entered the 430-bed, county-owned teaching hospital last winter for routine 
surgery to remove an ovarian cyst. Mack died on Feb. 1, after a series of 
surgical mistakes summed up by the Los Angeles County coroner as a "therapeutic 
misadventure." 
</P>
<P>
Records show that in surgery to remove the cyst, Mack's colon was accidentally 
cut and improperly repaired, resulting in spillage of feces into the abdominal 
cavity. This caused a potentially fatal infection, necessitating a second -- 
also unsuccessful -- operation. Because the abdominal infection continued to 
rage, the patient developed breathing difficulties. During ensuing diagnostic 
tests, a major blood vessel and the apex of her heart were punctured. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a chain of stupidity and incompetence the likes of which I've never 
seen," said Dr. Elias Amador, chief of the department of pathology that 
performed the autopsy on Mack. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Harry Thadepali, chief of King's division of infectious diseases, said, "I 
think this is the worst case I've ever seen. . . . That woman . . . really had 
no chance of getting out of this place alive. There were too many errors, too 
many mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he is so nervous about the number of "problem cases and . . . 
fundamental errors" by King physicians that he no longer refers patients for 
surgery at the hospital unless he knows specifically who is going to operate. 
"I want to make sure it's done by a competent doctor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
King's chief of obstetrics, Dr. Ezra Davidson, whose surgeons operated on Mack, 
declined to discuss the case. But he said, "The fact that death occurred does 
not mean something was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, these cases are not daily occurrences. And clearly King's medical 
staff has often 
</P>
<P>
struggled valiantly to treat a staggering load of acutely ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
But circumstances at King make quality medical care so difficult that even the 
hospital's medical director, Dr. James Haughton III, publicly acknowledged a 
year ago: "We are doing some bad things to patients." 
</P>
<P>
Haughton cited a severe shortage of staff, modern equipment and critical-care 
beds that make it more difficult for doctors to care for a unique, acutely ill 
patient population. 
</P>
<P>
Others say that despite the dedication of many King physicians, a lack of 
commitment and competence on the part of some doctors, as well as serious 
management problems at King, are also to blame for poor-quality medical care. 
</P>
<P>
State health inspectors last fall, for example, found that the hospital had no 
documentation to show that quality controls were in place in the emergency 
department. The controls are supposed to ensure that obvious problem cases and 
most deaths are reviewed by hospital trouble-shooters. 
</P>
<P>
For one reason or another -- and sometimes a combination of factors -- a 
disproportionate number of patients are dying at King, compared to the county's 
two other major acute care public hospitals. One recent study of hospital 
deaths among elderly patients throughout the nation ranked King as among the 
worst 50 of 5,577 hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, county, state and federal officials have mounted separate 
studies and investigations of the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
"The reputation of the hospital is that it's a place where things just don't 
get done," said Dr. Marshall T. Morgan, chief of emergency medicine at UCLA 
Medical Center. "There are some devoted, competent people doing their best 
under the circumstances. But whether it's at the level of the hospital or the 
(county Board of) Supervisors, obviously there is something wrong about the way 
the place is run." 
</P>
<P>
The problems at King are numerous and complex -- and often beyond the control 
of the people who work there. Hospital officials say: 
</P>
<P>
* The patients at King present a unique challenge. Typically deprived of basic, 
preventive health care, they often arrive at King with advanced illness and 
multiple complications. So many patients have been shot or knifed, either in 
gang warfare or other brutal assaults, that the hospital's trauma director has 
likened medical training at the hospital to "combat duty." 
</P>
<P>
* The County of Los Angeles, which funds and operates King, has failed to 
provide adequate financial support. Much of the medical equipment, for example, 
is antiquated or broken, resulting last year in a $27-million backlog of unmet 
equipment needs. 
</P>
<P>
* The hospital has had difficulty attracting top doctors because salaries are 
low, the neighborhood is dangerous, and the medical school affiliated with King 
has failed to provide doctors with supplemental economic and academic 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
* Many full-time physicians at King have off-campus private practices that 
divert their energy and attention away from medical care at the hospital. In 
some instances, full-time doctors have worked far fewer hours at King than they 
have been paid for. 
</P>
<P>
William Delgardo, King's veteran administrator, said: "Under the circumstances, 
the staff has done a hell of a job and someday . . . someone is going to give 
them the credit for it. That isn't to say we don't have problems. We have 
problems like any other hospital. But I'm tired of people running this hospital 
down. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Brian Johnson, immediate past president of the Los Angeles Society of 
Emergency Physicians, described King as an "indispensable" part of the county's 
health-care network. "The basic idea of (the hospital) is a good one," he said. 
"The only problem is that it should be excellent, and it is not. In fact, I 
think it is an embarrassment. The community deserves better." 
</P>
<P>
After the Watts riots of 1965, King was built by the county to provide badly 
needed medical care for residents of some of Los Angeles' poorest 
neighborhoods, while also serving as a training ground for mainly minority 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Since the doors opened in 1972, King has evolved from a community hospital into 
a major trauma center and a linchpin in the county's emergency-services 
network. 
</P>
<P>
As private hospitals have closed their trauma centers or curtailed emergency 
services, King has been forced to pick up the slack. From as far away as the 
Westside and downtown Los Angeles now comes an unending stream of ambulances 
delivering bleeding and feverish patients: victims of accidents, assaults and 
acute illness. 
</P>
<P>
The Times obtained the records of dozens of patients treated at King during a 
recent 2 1/2-year period. Some cases were gleaned from court records and 
hospital malpractice claims. Others were pointed out by frustrated medical 
personnel at King. 
</P>
<P>
Medical experts outside Los Angeles agreed to review a dozen selected cases for 
The Times, at no charge. They concluded that there is cause for concern and 
said they were moved to publicly discuss their findings because of the 
overwhelming suggestion of serious malfunctioning at King. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cases they reviewed involved patients who entered the hospital 
through its busy emergency department -- not by personal choice but because 
paramedics brought them there by ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, the patients lingered without adequate care and sometimes died. 
In other cases, they were subjected to questionable surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cases were not part of a comprehensive, scientifically random 
review of all patient care at King, the medical experts said the cases, 
individually, were egregious examples of bad medicine that seem to occur with 
enough regularity at King to cause worry. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, they said, the cases in sum illustrate some fundamental systemic 
failures within the hospital, including lack of good management and supervision 
by qualified senior attending physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, the gross patient death rate at King -- 2.4% of those admitted 
-- is higher than at the county's other two major teaching hospitals. Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center reported 1.5%, and Harbor General/UCLA 
reported 1.7% during 1987-88. During the previous two years, the gross death 
rate at King also was higher. 
</P>
<P>
Excluded from the gross death rate are patients who die in a hospital's 
emergency room. Statistics provided by hospital officials show that more 
patients died in King's emergency room during 1987-88 than in the emergency 
rooms at County-USC and Harbor/General combined. 
</P>
<P>
Among certain patients admitted to the hospital, such as heart attack victims, 
the death rate at King was considerably higher than at the other two county 
hospitals, according to gross mortality data collected by the state. Patients 
who underwent open heart surgery at King had one of the highest mortality rates 
in California until the hospital discontinued the service in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, among elderly Medicare patients, King has one of the worst death 
rates in the nation as well as in the state, according to a recent national 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Several investigations of patient care at King are under way. The Mack case, 
for example, was sent recently by the county coroner's office to the Los 
Angeles district attorney and state Board of Medical Quality Assurance for 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In the last several years, additional medical cases have come under review by 
the district attorney's office, although no conclusions have been reached. In 
May of 1987, the district attorney's office received from a King physician a 
list of cases said to demonstrate "gross negligence and medical malpractice 
occurring in the departments of surgery and emergency medicine" at King. The 
physician charged that the cases "testify to the lack of medical supervision in 
these two clinical departments and to the lack of competence of the house staff 
who are being 'trained.' " 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors was also alerted to substandard medical care at 
King in a lengthy report prepared by Legal Aid attorneys two years ago. And 
audits and management reviews of the hospital have repeatedly pointed out 
serious operational weaknesses at King that threaten the hospital's 
accreditation and jeopardize patient care. 
</P>
<P>
"Pervasive problems" in medical record keeping, for example, resulted in such a 
high incidence of lost, misfiled and incomplete patient charts that the 
"existing deficiencies are sufficient to jeopardize the quality of patient care 
and, potentially, the medical center's licensing," according to auditors. 
</P>
<P>
Auditors also cited a high incidence of hospital-borne infections attacking 
patients at King and noted fundamental inadequacies in the hospital's 
infection-control program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, billing foul-ups have cost the hospital millions of lost dollars, 
according to auditors. And lax controls have permitted doctors to hold outside 
jobs without authorization and to collect their paychecks at King based on 
blank time cards they signed, auditors reported. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, federal officials ordered state health investigators to 
conduct a thorough review of all facets of medical care at King. The inquiry 
was prompted by a recent national study that compared death rates among 
Medicare patients at 5,577 hospitals across the country. 
</P>
<P>
King ranked 35th from the bottom. Its score was worse than at any other public 
hospital in California except Riverside General Hospital. Both County-USC and 
Harbor/UCLA scored considerably better. 
</P>
<P>
The study reported that King's "risk-adjusted mortality was substantially 
higher -- 31% -- than the average for California's county and municipal 
hospitals" during both 1986 and 1987. King's patients were sicker than average, 
but "the difference (in severity) was not statistically significant," according 
to Dr. Michael Pine, president of the Chicago health-care consulting firm that 
prepared the analysis based on mortality data collected by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Delgardo, King's administrator, dismissed the study as unreliable and blamed 
King's high death rate on the nature of the hospital's patient population, 
rather than on any shortcomings in the hospital's medical care. He said 
patients tend to arrive at King sicker than usual and are therefore harder to 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the criticism of King, however, is coming from within the hospital 
itself. In June, top doctors and nurses signed declarations protesting proposed 
county funding cutbacks (now on hold) and pointing out problems with the 
hospital's medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians stated, for example, that patients sick with tuberculosis, other 
infectious diseases and heart ailments must wait more than a month for an 
appointment at the hospital's jammed outpatient clinics. 
</P>
<P>
A nurse said that the emergency room is so crowded that patients sometimes are 
forced to lie on backboards on the floor awaiting care. "Some patients have 
died in the emergency room, because they did not receive the close monitoring 
that they would have if they would have been admitted in an intensive care unit 
where they belonged," said nurse Walter Smith in one of the declarations. 
</P>
<P>
Thadepali, chief of King's division of infectious diseases, complained of a 
serious shortage of beds and equipment at the hospital, premature discharge of 
very sick patients, and acute staff shortages that threaten the hospital's 
accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sad to say," he concluded in his declaration, "but I believe we provided 
better quality medical services 13 years ago than we do today. In comparison to 
private hospitals and some other county hospitals in the country, the 
facilities at MLK (King) hospital are very poor and need to be improved." 
</P>
<P>
The emergency department at King is the hospital's hub. It is the point of 
entry, doctors said, for 78% of all patient admissions, compared to about 70% 
at County-USC; 80% at Harbor/UCLA; and a statewide hospital average of about 
20%. 
</P>
<P>
At times, it seems that emergency and trauma cases virtually overwhelm the 
hospital. "It's sort of like . . . the whole hospital is an emergency room," 
said Dr. Arthur Fleming, King's chief of trauma and surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Trauma cases typically crowd elective surgery off the day's schedule. Patients 
get bumped from their critical-care beds into wards to make way for even sicker 
patients, and the emergency room becomes clogged with patients on ventilators 
and monitors needing intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
"The emergency room is the front line," declared Dr. Sam Keim, a recent 
graduate of the emergency medicine residency program who described his tour of 
duty at King as a "nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the heaviest trauma situations in the world," he said. "It's 
face-to-face with Watts, face-to-face with the community. It's a battlefront. 
There's no buffer." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital treated about 2,420 trauma patients in 1988 and received an 
average of 1,200 emergency ambulance runs a month, county health officials 
said. About 70% of the time, the hospital's resources were stretched so thin 
that the emergency department had to be closed to all but walk-in patients. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter where you've been, King's a shock," said Dr. Kevin Ferguson, another 
recent graduate of King's emergency medicine residency program. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Charles Whiteman, who graduated last year with top honors as chief resident 
in emergency medicine, asserted that patients in King's emergency room receive 
"very minimal, substandard care." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he and other residents gave up filing formal reports of "screw-ups 
and substandard care" because the incidents were so frequent and the reports 
drew no reply from hospital administrators. 
</P>
<P>
As for quality-assurance controls in the emergency room, he said, "I didn't see 
any evidence of it." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, he suggested, stems from a lack of leadership at the top. 
The department of emergency medicine has been without a permanent chairman for 
more than seven years -- something that Haughton, the medical director, 
acknowledged is "just crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Because of this leadership void, Haughton has said that he personally gets 
called at 3 a.m. and on weekends "when things go wrong" in the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital statistics show that 867 patients died in King's emergency room during 
the last two fiscal years. 
</P>
<P>
The other two county hospitals could not provide comparable data for the fiscal 
year ending in June of 1989. But a comparison for fiscal 1988 showed that King 
had 457 emergency room deaths; Harbor/UCLA reported 142 deaths, and County-USC 
reported 242 deaths. County health officials could not provide comparable 
figures for the total number of emergency room visits at each hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Various explanations were offered for why more patients died in King's 
emergency room, even though it handles far fewer patients than County-USC, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
Outside medical experts who reviewed selected cases of patient care for The 
Times said it appears that young doctors in King's emergency room at times are 
not properly supervised and that the hospital, overall, is not always able to 
respond quickly to patients with life-threatening emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard H. Cales, chief of emergency medicine at San Francisco General 
Hospital and a recognized expert in the field, said that judging from the seven 
cases he reviewed, King appears to be "paralyzed" at times in responding to 
acute medical and surgical emergencies, forcing patients to undergo 
"unacceptable delays in diagnosis and treatment leading to avoidable death and 
disability." 
</P>
<P>
Cales said it appears that "certain (medical) services are simply unavailable, 
specifically neurosurgical. . . . Other services, which are apparently 
available, cannot respond because the hospital system is paralyzed. So, the 
patients are basically up against two problems, either one of which can 
adversely affect their care. They come requiring a service that isn't available 
or they come requiring a service that is supposedly available but not in a 
timely manner." 
</P>
<P>
Delgardo, King's administrator, said: "I'm not even going to respond to that 
kind of trash." 
</P>
<P>
But several senior physicians strongly defended King's patient care. Fleming, 
chief of trauma and surgery, said that staff shortages, antiquated equipment, 
and an overwhelming patient load all make it much harder to save lives at King 
than at other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"If you weigh the number of emergency cases, I marvel at our ability to keep 
going," he said. "We do the best we can given the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Theodore Schlater, acting chief of the department of emergency medicine, 
said he believes that the vast majority of deaths in the emergency room involve 
patients who were not medically "salvageable" upon arrival at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"If it looks like extraordinary numbers (of deaths) in comparison to our 
colleagues (at the county's other medical centers), I don't know why," Schlater 
said. But he said it probably reflects "the population we serve and what's 
happening in the streets," rather than any problems with the hospital's medical 
care. 
</P>
<P>
During the month of December, for example, there were 53 deaths in the 
emergency room, and Schlater said he initially thought: "Oh, my God! What's 
happening down here?" 
</P>
<P>
But he said that after looking at each case, he concluded that most patients 
had died because they were too sick to save. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to assess whether King's patients are actually sicker and harder to 
save than those who are taken to other public hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
But one gauge is to look at how many people are admitted from the emergency 
room to the hospital for treatment. During 1988, about 18% of the patients 
treated in the emergency rooms at both King and at Harbor/UCLA were were 
admitted to the hospital, compared to 24% at County-USC. 
</P>
<P>
As Dr. Gerald Whelan, associate director of emergency medicine at County-USC 
Medical Center, put it: "They have pretty sick patients, and we have pretty 
sick patients." 
</P>
<P>
One enormous obstacle in providing top-quality patient care at King is the 
shortage of modern equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"The equipment that is in this hospital . . . is the same equipment that was in 
the hospital when it opened in 1972," said Haughton, King's medical director. 
</P>
<P>
"The hospital is starved for resources," said Morgan at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at King pointed out that until late last year there was but a single 
defibrillator for all emergency heart patients. And women with gynecological 
emergencies during the night had to wait until morning for an ultrasound 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
It typically takes four to six hours to get laboratory results because the 
system is not computerized, residents said. And CT-Scans (computerized axial 
tomography) to pinpoint internal injuries such as hemorrhages and tumors often 
take even longer. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital has only a dozen critical-care beds equipped with special monitors 
and staffed by special nurses to care for critically ill patients. Usually, 
between two and four of the beds cannot be used because of the shortage of 
nurses, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the bed shortage, Fleming said that physicians at King are forced to 
discharge sick trauma patients who at any other hospital would be admitted for 
observation and care. 
</P>
<P>
If they are clearly too sick to discharge, the patients are held in the 
emergency room until a bed becomes free. Doctors said patients have been forced 
to wait in the emergency room as long as five or six days -- despite an 
unwritten rule of emergency medicine that patients should be moved out in no 
more than about four hours. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if patients had died because they were stuck in the emergency room 
awaiting proper placement, Haughton said, "I think so, yes. I don't think 
there's any doubt that there are patients that if we could have gotten them to 
the intensive care unit . . . they would have had a better chance for 
survival." 
</P>
<P>
"The emergency room is like a funnel with a cork at the bottom," summed up Dr. 
Ron Melendez, who graduated in June from King's emergency medicine residency 
program. "There are patients coming from every angle. You can't get X-rays 
back. Patients are sitting here and there. Paramedics keep coming, and we can't 
get patients moved out" into hospital beds for specialized care. 
</P>
<P>
Help may be on the way. King is planning a multimillion-dollar expansion of the 
trauma center, to be financed through a county bond issue. In the meantime, to 
relieve some of the stress on the emergency room, an "emergi-center" was set up 
in May to treat patients with non-life-threatening problems. Furthermore, much 
of the antiquated and broken equipment is now being replaced, thanks to an 
appropriation of $6.5 million by the county supervisors last year. 
</P>
<P>
But money alone is not the solution to all of King's problems. 
</P>
<P>
A review of individual trauma and emergency cases pointed out problems of 
management and supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"There's certainly a consistent suggestion . . . that there isn't good 
supervision, and there is an inordinate amount of time before people get to the 
operating room or to definitive diagnosis," said Dr. Michael L. Callaham, chief 
of emergency medicine at the University of California's Moffitt-Long Hospital 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Cales, at San Francisco General Hospital, said: "There is a common thread: 
supervision. The mistakes that were made . . . can be minimized or avoided 
thorough review and participation by qualified attending (physicians)." 
</P>
<P>
Both doctors, for example, faulted the handling of a patient who was rushed to 
King in February of 1987 suffering from a gunshot wound in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
In the apparently mistaken belief that the patient was unconscious and about to 
die, trauma surgeons tried to stick a breathing tube down his throat and 
perform emergency surgery, cutting deep into the patient's chest cavity through 
the muscle and between the ribs -- all without giving him any anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
In agony, the patient -- described in records as "awake and somewhat alert" -- 
nearly leaped from the operating table. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat up and I said, 'Doc, don't let her cut me again because I'm not out!" 
recalled the patient, who is now fully recovered and asked that his name be 
withheld. "Never will I forget it. . . . I could feel my skin ripping from the 
knife." 
</P>
<P>
With his chest open, the patient was rushed to the operating room and sedated 
for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming, King's trauma chief, defended the surgeons' "judgment call" in 
performing the emergency operation, called a thoracotomy. 
</P>
<P>
The operation is supposed to be reserved as a last-ditch measure to save an 
unconscious patient in imminent danger of death. With the chest open, doctors 
can reach vital internal organs to perform heart massage, for example, or to 
control a hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
But in his review of this case, Callaham pointed out that the patient "really 
did not need" the emergency operation because he was conscious with an 
acceptable blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a mistake that should be committed by an experienced physician," 
Callaham said. "And people in training should be supervised by somebody . . . 
who would be there to say, 'No, this is not somebody whose chest you should be 
opening right now.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another "astounding" example of bad medicine that might well have been avoided 
by better supervision, Callaham said, is the case of 18-year-old Temeka 
Williams, who was shot in the head in a gang drive-by shooting on Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Upon her arrival at King, trauma surgeons attempted to perform a 
cricothyroidotomy to open a small airway in her throat. But in the process, 
they cut both her jugular veins, triggering a massive hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
"You're supposed to make a little incision about an inch to an 
inch-and-a-half," said Callaham in describing the procedure. "To get the 
anterior jugulars . . . you have to be working at decapitating. . . . You're so 
far away from where you're supposed to be!" 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John G. West, an Orange County trauma surgeon who also reviewed the case, 
agreed that the operation was "botched." And Cales said after his review, 
"Somebody overreacted and got in there and started slashing. . . . The 
complications in this case are serious and fall into the category of who is 
minding the store?" 
</P>
<P>
Fleming described the case as a difficult one, with the patient struggling and 
the situation becoming "rather chaotic." 
</P>
<P>
"While one could blame the lack of an adequate amount of local anesthesia or an 
inadequate time for the anesthesia to work, the clinical decision about the 
urgency of such procedures cannot be dictated, but is a judgment call," Fleming 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One troubling aspect of King's emergency and trauma care is the scarcity of 
neurosurgeons to care for a very heavy load of patients with spinal and head 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials said that hospitals countywide have had trouble finding 
neurosurgeons willing to treat patients in their emergency rooms and trauma 
centers, because private practice is so much more lucrative and the hours are 
regular. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as a Level I trauma center, Los Angeles County regulations 
require King to have a neurosurgeon on the premises or available within 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But there are instances where patients needing immediate neurosurgical 
attention have languished for hours in King's emergency room and sometimes died 
before being seen by a qualified neurosurgeon. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the trauma (patient) comes in between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.," said Keim, a 
recent King graduate, "the attending neurosurgeon is not going to see them." 
</P>
<P>
Whiteman, another recent graduate, concurred: "No matter what time they 
(patients with head or spinal injuries) come in at night, the neurosurgery 
attendings won't come in (to see them) until 7 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. George Locke, chairman of the department of neuroscience, acknowledged a 
serious shortage of neurosurgeons at the hospital, mainly due to low salaries. 
In December, the department lost one of its most devoted, hard-working 
neurosurgeons, leaving only two full-time neurosurgeons to care for as many as 
40 patients a day and perform about 300 operations a year, Locke said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the hospital has no specially trained neurosurgery resident doctors to 
assist with the heavy workload. Instead, the neurosurgeons must rely for help 
upon a corps of unlicensed medical generalists with no training in 
neurosurgery. 
</P>
<P>
These aides cannot perform operations, for example. Mostly, they accompany 
patients to the CT-Scan machine and keep in touch by phone with the attending 
neurosurgeon on duty. 
</P>
<P>
Locke said that he has been called to make decisions when he was as far away as 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"People know where to find me," he said. "(At night) I'm always at home. . . . 
I can give telephone instructions to do this and that, and then give me the 
results, and I'll make the decision whether to come in." 
</P>
<P>
Two or three times a month, he said, he goes into the hospital during the 
middle of the night to treat patients. 
</P>
<P>
But the situation is far from satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
In a June memorandum, Haughton, the medical director, complained: "At the 
moment, Dr. Locke is practically alone in staffing the department. This is 
having a very adverse effect on the operation of the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said patients have died as a result. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of cases . . . have wound up in fatalities to young people who with 
more rapid neurosurgical intervention may have survived or done well," said Dr. 
Melendez. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the death of a 27-year-old woman he described as "probably the 
most tragic case I've had since I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
Delirious and in critical condition, the woman arrived at King shortly before 
midnight on March 29, 1988, her medical records show. She was diagnosed as 
suffering from meningitis or hydrocephalus -- a swelling of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
A CT-Scan indicated at 2 a.m. that she needed an operation, called a 
ventriculostomy, to relieve internal pressure in the head and prevent the brain 
from rupturing. 
</P>
<P>
But she languished for hours without surgery and was brain-dead by the time an 
attending neurosurgeon finally came to examine her in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time she had the CT-Scan until the time she herniated, as I remember, 
(there was) . . . plenty of time for something to be done," Melendez said. 
"After she herniated about 5 a.m., the game was over. The attending 
(neurosurgeon) came in an hour or two later, like on morning rounds, about 7 
a.m., and at that point she was considered inoperative." 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the patient's charts, Callaham concluded, "Nothing happens 
until, of course, all of a sudden the attending (physician) comes in in the 
morning and recognizes the disaster, but it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
If the patient had been operated on promptly, Callaham said, "she probably 
would have come out neurologically normal." 
</P>
<P>
The attending neurosurgeon at King who examined the patient said he remembered 
little about the case. But, asked if quicker action might have saved her, he 
said, "Possibly." 
</P>
<P>
Cales, at San Francisco General Hospital, said, "If you can't get a 
neurosurgeon in within . . . at most within 30 minutes, then they shouldn't be 
receiving such patients," he said. "There should be a sign up saying that's not 
a real emergency department . . . or trauma center and they shouldn't be 
directing patients there because they're not going to get the care they need." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Beverly Vedder was so upset by angry phone calls from homeowners that she 
occasionally broke down and cried. 
</P>
<P>
"I was reduced to tears at times," testified the former secretary for giant 
housing developer Kaufman &amp; Broad. "I was overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
Of the many homeowner grievances that Vedder received, one especially stuck in 
her mind. It came from owners of a home in the Riverside area who complained 
that the bathroom floor in their new house slanted so badly that they had to 
hold on to the toilet to keep from sliding off. 
</P>
<P>
That and similar complaints from other homeowners in the Riverside area were 
initially ignored by Kaufman &amp; Broad, Vedder testified. She said company 
officials seemed to think that "if this was pushed aside long enough it would 
go away." 
</P>
<P>
The complaints have not gone away, however, and are now at the center of an 
uncommonly bitter and prolonged lawsuit between Kaufman &amp; Broad -- 
California's largest builder of single-family houses -- and dozens of 
homeowners in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman &amp; Broad officials dismiss most of the allegations in the suit as 
sour grapes by disgruntled or misinformed former employees and characterize the 
Riverside litigants as fortune-seekers manipulated by unethical attorneys who 
are trying to capitalize on honest and fixable errors. The company maintains 
that it consistently builds quality houses at reasonable cost to fulfill the 
American Dream of home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"The Riverside litigation is driven by plaintiffs with unreasonable 
expectations and fueled by greedy lawyers," said company chief executive Bruce 
Karatz. 
</P>
<P>
But accusations emerging from interviews and testimony under oath in 
depositions taken by homeowners' attorneys in the 4-year-old lawsuit tell a 
story of dozens of dream homes gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
It is a story that began with the promise of that increasingly rare commodity 
in California: quality housing for first-time home buyers at affordable prices. 
But, according to customers and former employees of Kaufman &amp; Broad, the 
promise of quality was frequently compromised by fast-paced construction 
schedules, and homeowner complaints of shoddy workmanship often were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, some construction workers laughed about the quality of the homes 
they were building in Riverside and even referred to them as a "joke," 
according to the testimony of one former construction employee. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of homes were built in Riverside and neighboring Corona without proper 
plans and, when serious structural problems appeared, company officials tried 
to cover them up, according to sworn statements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gifts for Inspectors 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kaufman &amp; Broad gave liquor and substantial gifts to building 
inspectors who were responsible for enforcing construction code standards, and 
one inspector from the city of Riverside approved homes without even looking at 
them in order to help the company meet its construction schedule, according to 
a sworn admission by the inspector and other sworn statements. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner litigation is common in the building industry, and it cannot be 
determined with certainty how the quality of Kaufman &amp; Broad homes compares 
to those of other large developers. But the company has been at the center of a 
series of high-profile controversies. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside County lawsuit marks the fifth time in two decades that Kaufman 
&amp; Broad has been accused of serious misconduct, ranging from bribery to 
substandard construction practices. The district attorney's office in Riverside 
County is examining transcripts of witnesses' testimony gathered in the civil 
case, but no charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FTC Probes Complaints 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission staff is also looking into complaints of shoddy 
building practices in connection with the Riverside suit, according to Thomas 
Massie, attorney with the FTC enforcement division in Washington. Kaufman &amp; 
Broad is currently operating under a 1979 FTC consent order based on alleged 
substandard building practices. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman &amp; Broad officials insist they have fewer problems than the building 
industry norm, saying that they have sharply increased the time and money spent 
on ensuring that buyers are happy. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has built more than 175,000 homes worldwide in the last 32 years, 
fewer than 1% of which have problems, company officials say. The company 
contends that nearly a quarter of its buyers say they have gotten favorable 
recommendations from other Kaufman &amp; Broad homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not perfect, by any means," company chief executive Karatz said. "Our 
products are built by hand, in the heat, rain and wind. This is a people 
business and people can make mistakes. In the vast majority of incidents, we 
take care of these mistakes quickly and to our customers' satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
The company has received numerous industry design, architectural and marketing 
awards in recent years. "For the volume they do, they're an exceptional 
company," according to Sanford Goodkin, a real estate consultant in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leading Builder 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp., as the Los Angeles-based company is now 
formally known, occupies an important corner of the California housing 
marketplace as a leading provider of shelter for the middle-class. Its 
customers are commonly young couples acquiring a home for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The company expects to build more than 4,000 homes this year statewide, largely 
in fast-growing, metropolitan areas. The prices average about $160,000 
statewide, which is inexpensive by California standards. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman &amp; Broad's financial fortunes have never looked better. Profits have 
reached record levels and sales are expected to surpass $1 billion this year 
for the first time following a reorganization last year that turned Kaufman 
&amp; Broad Home Corp. into an independently owned and operated company. 
</P>
<P>
But the firm has a long history of serious problems, ranging from criminal 
convictions in Chicago in the early 1970s to homeowner lawsuits all over 
California in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Chicago cases involved a former president of Kaufman &amp; Broad of 
Illinois who pleaded guilty to bribing a federal building official with three 
cases of liquor while he was head of the company. In the second case, in 1973, 
Kaufman &amp; Broad was fined $50,000 after pleading no contest to charges that 
the company was involved in bribing officials of suburban Hoffman Estates in a 
zoning change scandal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chicago Investigation 
</P>
<P>
The company also was under such heavy fire from dissatisfied homeowners in the 
Chicago area that the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into the 
firm's building and sales practices dating back to the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman &amp; Broad promised the public and its investors that it would do 
better. "We've learned our lesson," company Chairman Eli Broad told a trade 
journal in 1972. "The industry has to increase its quality and learn to treat 
consumers differently." 
</P>
<P>
By 1979 the FTC had completed its investigation, and without admitting guilt, 
Kaufman &amp; Broad signed an agreement that it would cease such practices as 
false advertising, building substandard houses and furnishing model homes with 
undersized beds to make rooms look larger than they actually were. 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, the company was again in criminal trouble, this time in Santa Clara 
County Superior Court where it was fined more than $200,000 in connection with 
charges that it induced Milpitas city inspectors to falsify building inspection 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cases of Liquor 
</P>
<P>
Company documents obtained by authorities investigating that case indicate that 
Kaufman &amp; Broad routinely offered cases of liquor to city, county and 
utility company officials with which the developer dealt in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman &amp; Broad officials admit that the company has had problems in the 
past, but they say they are ancient history and irrelevant. And they say they 
have fired any employees found guilty of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is as different today as . . . Chrysler is today versus 15 years 
ago," chief executive Karatz said. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, Kaufman &amp; Broad was a far-flung company with operations 
across the United States and Europe. But the firm has since cut back and now 
operates primarily in California and France. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was impossible to meet a standard (of excellence) in multiple 
markets," Karatz said. "We decided to focus on a few areas and do it well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints Continue 
</P>
<P>
Despite the new smaller-is-better philosophy, serious customer complaints have 
continued into the mid- and late-1980s, interviews and court records show. 
</P>
<P>
In the Northern California town of Novato, for example, 88 townhouse owners are 
suing Kaufman &amp; Broad, charging that their homes were so poorly constructed 
that many of them must be reframed and that whole walls must be ripped out and 
rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman &amp; Broad's own building expert corroborated many of the homeowners' 
complaints in a sworn deposition taken by the San Francisco law firm of 
Alexander Anolik, representing the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 suit, concerning homes built in the early- to mid-1970s, is scheduled 
for trial this month, but Karatz noted that "lots of settlement discussions are 
going on." He declined to discuss the homeowner allegations in the case. 
</P>
<P>
But of all the complaints by buyers of Kaufman &amp; Broad homes, perhaps the 
most acrimonious are the ones in Riverside County, where several lawsuits have 
been filed in recent years involving new housing tracts near the Riverside 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter Standoff 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the litigation has been settled in recent months, a major 
lawsuit remains in a bitter standoff. That suit, which involves 34 homeowners, 
is scheduled to go to trial next March. 
</P>
<P>
Karatz believes the homeowners no longer want to fix the problems but are 
simply seeking "money, lots of it." In related cases that have been settled out 
of court, the firm has agreed to fix the homes or buy them back at fair market 
value. Both offers also include compensation payments. 
</P>
<P>
Karatz has also attacked the plaintiff's attorneys, claiming he can see the 
"venom in the eyes" of one of the lawyers, Christopher P. Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the defense of the desperate: 'Kill the lawyers,' " replies Ruiz, whose 
high-rise office is just a few blocks down Wilshire Boulevard from Kaufman 
&amp; Broad's corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sending a Message 
</P>
<P>
E. Allen Tharpe III, a senior partner in the firm for which Ruiz works, said 
the homeowners have turned aside settlement offers because they are furious 
over the company's previous behavior. "They want to send a message to the 
building industry that they can't get away with this kind of behavior," Tharpe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to interviews and an extensive review of depositions and court 
records, here's what went wrong in Riverside: 
</P>
<P>
Although the homeowners charge that their houses are badly built throughout, 
central to their case are homes built with second-story overhangs, known as 
double cantilevers, at the rear and sides of the houses. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1983 and early 1984, after they moved into their houses, it became 
clear to some of the homeowners that something was seriously wrong: the 
second-story bedrooms slanted, the bathtubs did not drain properly, the toilets 
tilted, and gaps had opened between walls and baseboards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Notified 
</P>
<P>
The case came to the attention of top management at Kaufman &amp; Broad in the 
spring of 1984 when Martin G. Roberts, then head of the firm's Southern 
California operations, said he got a call from a homeowner whose tub did not 
drain properly. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said he became curious when he found similar complaints in the company 
files and asked Gary Clark, then director of operations, to explain. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts testified that Clark ultimately acknowledged that he had changed the 
design of the homes by extending a single overhang at the rear of the houses to 
the sides as well, in effect turning a single-cantilever home into a 
double-cantilever design. 
</P>
<P>
It was a change that Clark made in the field without the advice of an architect 
or engineer because it provided more room upstairs in order to help 
salespeople, who were "having a tough time selling that particular house 
because the rooms were too small," Roberts said in a deposition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confirmed by Subcontractor 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Valdemar Montalvo, president of the framing company that did 
subcontracting work on some of the Riverside homes, confirmed that he added the 
second overhang without new plans or engineering at Clark's request. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the problem, Roberts testified that he told Karatz what he had 
learned and recommended that Clark be fired because of the design change, among 
other reasons. Clark did resign, but Karatz then hired him back over Roberts' 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
Karatz "did not feel we could fill Clark's shoes and still maintain the number 
of closings (completed homes) that we had projected for the year," Roberts 
testified. Roberts said he resigned shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Karatz denied Roberts' assertions regarding Clark and maintained that Roberts 
himself was asked to leave the company rather than resigning on his own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Points to Plans on File 
</P>
<P>
Clark has testified that a bona fide set of plans was used to build the 
double-cantilever homes. And while Karatz admits framing errors were made on 
the homes, he refutes allegations that the overhangs were improvised and points 
to a set of double-cantilever plans on file with the federal Veterans 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans Administration construction analyst Ernest Mentas, now retired, signed 
a sworn statement last June that he did indeed sign such a set of plans in 
April, 1983, prior to construction of the double-cantilever homes. 
</P>
<P>
Construction plans are submitted for approval to the Veterans Administration to 
provide a measure of protection for veterans applying for federal loans. For 
homes carrying a 10-year warranty -- as did the Kaufman &amp; Broad houses in 
Riverside County -- the structures are inspected by federal officials only 
after completion. 
</P>
<P>
Local inspectors from the cities of Riverside and Corona were responsible for 
ensuring that the homes met building code standards at various stages of 
construction, such as the pouring of foundations and framing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Witnesses 
</P>
<P>
But no such double-cantilever plans for the homes in question can be found on 
file in the building departments of Riverside or Corona, and other witnesses 
besides Roberts and Montalvo testified that no bona fide plans were used to 
build the overhang sections of the homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Kaufman &amp; Broad's production schedules were such that there was no time to 
get the plans or calculations drawn up and submitted for approval," said Lou 
Baxter, former general superintendent with the company. "Production went 
forward immediately." 
</P>
<P>
When homeowners began complaining that their floors were sagging, company 
service representatives were told to cover up the fact that the problems were 
caused by a structural defect, according to sworn statements. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Sorenson, a director of customer service for Kaufman &amp; Broad for 
seven months in 1984-85, said in a sworn statement this spring that company 
Vice President Frank Scardina "gave me the impression that he wanted me to lie 
about the problem and deny and cover up the fact that a problem existed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Stucco Theory 
</P>
<P>
Sorenson also said company officials misled homeowners by telling them that 
stucco applied to the outside of their homes would prevent further sagging of 
the cantilevered overhangs. 
</P>
<P>
"The stucco theory was created to cover up the truth and hide the fact that the 
homes had a structural defect," Sorenson said in a deposition. "In fact, both 
Lou Baxter and Frank Scardina told me that the application of the stucco made 
the double-cantilever problem worse. . . . When Frank Scardina told me about 
this 'stucco theory,' I thought it was a joke. We both laughed about it for 
some time." 
</P>
<P>
However, Baxter insisted in a sworn statement that he did indeed believe the 
application of stucco would prevent further sagging of the second-story 
overhang, while Scardina denied having any such conversation with Sorenson. 
</P>
<P>
Angry homeowners in Riverside also maintain that their homes might not be 
flawed if public building inspectors had not been so chummy with Kaufman &amp; 
Broad. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside city inspector Dean C. Johnson, now retired, admitted in a sworn 
statement that he received gifts from Kaufman &amp; Broad of at least 120 
2-by-4s, 60 sheets of plywood sheathing, 20 to 30 gallons of paint, four window 
frames, plastic piping, a countertop, a garbage disposal and miscellaneous 
hardware. Johnson, who testified in exchange for a promise that he would not be 
sued, said the company gave him and other inspectors liquor as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inflating the Price 
</P>
<P>
A sworn statement by former company tract superintendent John Davis maintains 
that Clark arranged for a subcontractor to pour a cement slab for Johnson's 
mobile home and to hide the cost of the slab by inflating the price of other 
work billed to Kaufman &amp; Broad. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to bury the costs for this labor and material," said Davis, "Gary 
Clark told me to tell the subcontractor . . . to overbill Kaufman &amp; Broad 
for . . . work which was actually done." Johnson denied in a sworn statement 
that the gifts were bribes, but he nevertheless admitted routinely falsifying 
inspections of Kaufman &amp; Broad homes at the request of company construction 
superintendents. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he frequently declared on official city reports that houses had 
been properly finished when in fact they were incomplete. He also stated that 
in many cases he signed final inspection reports for houses he looked at only 
from the curb or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Johnson would not even require the company to obtain city building 
permits for houses until after foundations were poured and framing was to 
begin, according to a document in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50% Lapse Admitted 
</P>
<P>
Davis said in his sworn statement that "Johnson on occasion would allow certain 
aspects of the beginning phases of construction to move forward without a 
building permit in order that Kaufman &amp; Broad's production schedule would 
not be held up." 
</P>
<P>
In a sworn statement, Johnson admitted that in 50% of the homes in the Kaufman 
&amp; Broad tracts, he did not make legally required inspections of framing, 
insulation, exterior lath and wallboards, rough or final electrical wiring, 
rough or final plumbing and other elements of construction. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman &amp; Broad denies giving presents to inspectors in Riverside County or 
improper relationships with the officials, pointing to an official company 
policy against making such gifts. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Riverside County district attorney's staff is reading 
through the volumes of sworn testimony in the case. "It's something we're still 
interested in," said Assistant Dist. Atty. Randy Tagami.

Nicholas and Alexander, the two rare beaked whales that have amazed ocean 
scientists by surviving for more than a week, are continuing to hold their own 
and Alexander even ate three pounds of herring. The two had not been expected 
to survive the night when they were brought to Marine World/Africa USA animal 
park in Vallejo after beaching themselves Aug. 24 on San Francisco's Ocean 
Beach. The deep-ocean whales have been surviving on a diet of "fish shakes" 
force fed to them through tubes. Another rare whale -- a young, female pygmy 
sperm whale found beached between Santa Cruz and Monterey last week -- was 
given only a 1-in-10 chance of survival.

Federal officials seized a small Lebanese jet that landed without permission in 
Harrisburg, Pa., and questioned three passengers who they feared could be 
terrorists. An investigation showed they were not terrorists but aliens who 
failed to check in with immigration officials, said Henry Brattlie, deputy 
director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service office in 
Philadelphia. He said the jet, with two pilots and at least six others on 
board, left London and landed at Harrisburg International Airport last Sunday 
after disregarding orders to travel to Philadelphia for an immigration 
inspection. Brattlie said the $13-million jet was seized and three passengers 
detained after the jet returned to Harrisburg from Burbank, Calif. A U.S. 
attorney said the three detainees were released while officials decide whether 
to press charges.

Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who played a key role in ending the 
Persian Gulf War, has resigned as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. 
Tehran Radio said Rafsanjani offered his resignation to the nation's supreme 
leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying his new job as president leaves him 
little time for the armed forces. Rafsanjani, appointed to the top military 
post by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, persuaded the late spiritual leader to 
accept a cease-fire last August in the eight-year war with Iraq.

Mohawks fought with baseball bats and clubs outside a casino over the issue of 
gambling on the St. Regis Indian Reservation in New York state, an issue that 
has sharply divided the tribe. The clash resulted in minor injuries, but state 
police, who raided Indian gambling establishments last July, immediately sealed 
off the entire 22,000-acre reservation. Last weekend, one casino was set afire, 
leading the owner of another to station men with automatic weapons on the roof 
of his establishment.

REPORT SAYS HUD FIGURE SHREDDED FILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deborah Gore Dean, a key figure in the ongoing investigation of political abuse 
of HUD programs, stated in a deposition that she had her office files shredded 
as she was leaving her job as executive aide to former Housing and Urban 
Development Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., the New York Times reported. "I 
gave them to the inspector general and had them shredded by the inspector 
general," Dean said in the April, 1988, deposition, according to the newspaper. 
But Inspector General Paul A. Adams, HUD's chief internal investigator, told 
the newspaper he did not know what Dean was talking about. Federal agencies 
differ on their rules for saving office files and there was no indication of 
any wrongdoing by Dean in her handling of the documents, the newspaper said. 
Dean, Pierce's assistant from 1984 to 1987, gave the deposition in a civil 
lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Chicago which involved developers accusing 
HUD of reneging on an agreement to renegotiate the terms of a mortgage on a 
large housing project.

A strike loomed for the 29,000-student San Jose school district as contract 
talks between district officials and teachers' representatives broke down. 
Supt. James Baughman said the district had rejected the latest demand from 
teachers for a 10% raise this year and a retroactive raise of 6% for last year. 
The district is offering 6% this year with a 1% salary bonus. Teachers are 
expected to strike when school opens Tuesday, but district officials said they 
will try to keep classes operating.

Federal officers made whopping seizures on two different coasts when they found 
drugs hidden in trucks on board ships. In Columbia City, about 30 miles 
northeast of Portland, Ore., officers confiscated about 25 tons of hashish 
concealed in flatbed trucks offloaded from a docked sea vessel, the 158-foot 
Lady Brigid. Seven people were arrested in the $156-million seizure called the 
largest of its kind on the West Coast. The "high-grade" hashish was believed to 
be from the Middle East. It was concealed in a false compartment, officers 
said. Near Tampa, Fla., agents found 824 pounds of cocaine concealed in a truck 
shipped from Honduras and 23,000 pounds of marijuana was seized on a fishing 
boat. The cocaine was worth about $5.6 million wholesale.

British undercover soldiers shot and killed a Protestant extremist in Northern 
Ireland minutes after he and another gunman killed a Roman Catholic in the 
Ardoyne area of Belfast, security sources said. Residents said the man killed 
by the army is believed to be a member of the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force. 
His accomplice was wounded. Witnesses said the two attackers came up to their 
victim, Patrick McKenna, 38, on a motorcycle and that one dismounted and shot 
McKenna. As the attackers sped off, leaving McKenna dead on the sidewalk, their 
motorcycle was rammed by an unmarked military car carrying out an undercover 
patrol.

MORE EAST GERMANS POUR INTO CAMPS IN HUNGARY

Hundreds of East Germans poured into refugee camps in Hungary on Saturday, 
joining thousands of others waiting for an unprecedented exodus of East Bloc 
citizens to the West. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 East Germans already were inside the camps in and near 
Budapest, awaiting passage to West Germany under an arrangement between Bonn 
and Communist Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities will not say when the transfer is to take place, although it is 
believed it will begin within days. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time a Warsaw Pact nation and a North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization country have worked together to move huge masses of people from 
another Warsaw Pact nation. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Red Cross official Andras Kovacs, in charge of the Csilleberc refugee 
camp in Budapest, said Saturday that six buses carrying about 250 people had 
departed for Zanka, a new camp opened 90 miles to the southwest to house the 
overflow from the Budapest camp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crowded Emergency Quarters 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, thousands of East Germans have crowded emergency quarters in 
Hungary, refusing to leave unless guaranteed safe passage to the West. 
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 already have fled to West Germany through Austria. The exodus 
started shortly after Hungary began removing barbed wire and other barriers 
from its westernmost border in May. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany grants East German refugees automatic citizenship and assistance 
in starting a new life. The influx has generated resentment among some West 
Germans, who feel that the large number of East Germans coming into the country 
will strain its resources. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl alluded to this concern on Saturday during a 
speech in Cologne. He urged West Germans to show more tolerance for German 
refugees arriving from the East in search of a better life. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be going a bad way if we didn't now help the Germans from East 
Germany and Poland," he said, adding that the emigrants should not be looked 
down on as economic refugees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traditional Vacation Spot 
</P>
<P>
Hungary has been a traditional vacation spot for East Germans who have 
difficulty getting permission for legal travel to the West from their hard-line 
Communist government but can come to the liberal Soviet Bloc country relatively 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 East Germans are now in Hungary. Hungarian Prime Minister Miklos 
Nemeth has estimated that up to 20,000 want to go to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In Bavaria, West Germany's main border state with Austria, hundreds of Red 
Cross personnel began work Saturday on a fifth "tent city" for the expected 
influx of East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
A West German spokesman said work was on schedule, with all five tent 
communities expected to be standing by late today with a capacity of 5,000. 
Austrian railway officials, meanwhile, kept up to 50 train cars ready for quick 
movement to border points with Hungary when the transport starts. 
</P>
<P>
Austrian border officials said about 50 more East Germans fled illegally from 
Hungary overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Under a bilateral agreement, Hungary is obliged to send East Germans trying to 
flee to the West back to their Communist homeland.

Large numbers of Soviet Jews would be ineligible for admission to the United 
States as refugees under plans drafted by the State Department and other 
agencies, the New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said a likely effect would be to channel many would-be immigrants 
to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Bush Administration is opposing bills passed by both the 
Senate and the House of Representatives that would make it easier for Soviet 
Jews to come to America as refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted unnamed State and Justice department officials as saying that 
allowing free immigration of Soviet Jews would impose immense resettlement 
costs on the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Jewish emigration rose from 8,155 in 1987 to 18,9655 last year and 
appears likely to exceed 48,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the State Department plan, Soviet Jews who have no relatives in the 
United States or ties to it would become ineligible for admission as refugees, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>

U.S. State and Justice Department officials were unavailable for comment.

GLEMP CALLS FOR NEW TALKS ON AUSCHWITZ; JEWS BOYCOTT CEREMONY

<P>
Poland's primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, called for renegotiations to try to 
settle the controversy surrounding the Carmelite convent near the Auschwitz 
death camp as leaders of many of the world's religions -- except the faith that 
suffered the worst half a century ago -- took part Saturday in a procession of 
rememberance for the camp's victims. 
</P>
<P>
In a newspaper interview published in Rome on Saturday, Glemp was quoted as 
saying that the 1987 pact calling for the removal of the convent, located 
outside the walls at Auschwitz, must be renegotiated because it was handled in 
Geneva by "men who are not competent." 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators included Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, who led the 
rememberance ceremony at Auschwitz and the nearby death camp at Birkenau. 
Jewish leaders refused to participate in the observance to dramatize their 
anger over the Roman Catholic Church's refusal to remove the convent. 
</P>
<P>
Glemp told Italian reporters in the interview in Warsaw that Macharski "did not 
understand the people's situation" at the time and signed the accord "because 
things were done in a little too much haste." 
</P>
<P>
"I want the accord renegotiated," Glemp added. "It should be done by competent 
people and not by cardinals who don't understand how things stand," he was 
quoted as saying in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Only Krakow Church' 
</P>
<P>
"Macharski has not understood the situation. . . . He represents only the 
Krakow church, the problem is much broader than that," Glemp was reported as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 individuals representing the various faiths took part in the 
procession, held the day after the 50th anniversary of the start of World War 
II when Nazi Germany invaded Poland on Sept. 1, 1939. Jews held their own 
solemn ceremony by praying in the Warsaw synagogue Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Macharski, whose diocese includes Auschwitz now known by its Polish name, 
Oswiechim, told religious leaders who gathered for Saturday's ceremony: "From 
this place we should say no to all hatred of Judaism, no to all contempt and 
racial prejudice, no to the will to dominate others." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Here the Nazi hatred killed millions of men, women and children. 
Jews were destined for the extermination which is now called the Holocaust or 
(by its Hebrew name) Shoah. Gypsies and Muslims were condemned to expiration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Horrible Place' 
</P>
<P>
"In this horrible place, the decision must be strengthened (to fight) against 
the evil which dominated here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A requiem by Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki played as participants laid 
flowers at plaques in memory of the 4 million people, most of them Jews, who 
perished in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
Macharski declined to comment on the dispute over the convent. But he told 
Albert Assouline, one of only two Jews, neither a leader, who were present, "I 
hope that we will come to an agreement despite all the differences." 
</P>
<P>
But Macharski and Glemp have been the principal cause of the dispute for many 
Jews because of recent comments suggesting the nuns would stay despite the 1987 
Catholic-Jewish agreement that called for the convent to have been removed by 
last February. 
</P>
<P>
Jews contend the presence of the Carmelite nuns interferes with the special 
significance of the death camps to Judaism and with Jewish beliefs on prayer 
for the dead. Polish Catholics have argued that many of their own people, as 
well as others from other faiths, also were killed by the Nazis at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Vatican on Saturday denied that it had told the World Jewish 
Congress that Pope John Paul II had instructed Polish church leaders to respect 
the 1987 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The WJC said Friday in New York that Vatican sources had told it the Pope had 
felt forced to intervene because of the growing international dispute over the 
convent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No New Initiative 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no recent new initiative on the part of the Holy See on this 
matter," a Vatican spokesman said.

ANKARA TO LIFT BAN TODAY ON TRAINS WITH ETHNIC TURKS FROM BULGARIA

The Turkish government today will lift a ban on European trains entering from 
Bulgaria that it imposed to stem the influx of ethnic Turks, the Foreign 
Ministry said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming that Bulgaria will no longer board any of its citizens without entry 
visas, the train will be allowed to enter Turkey from Sept. 3," ministry 
spokesman Murat Sungar said. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey reimposed entry visa requirements for Bulgarian citizens on Aug. 22 and 
stopped the Munich-Istanbul train crossing the border three days later. 
</P>
<P>
"We can always resume the ban on the train if Bulgaria does not comply," Sungar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Over 310,000 ethnic Turks from Bulgaria have entered Turkey since June when 
Ankara waived visa requirements for ethnic refugees fleeing what they see as 
forced Bulgarian assimilation. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey said it had insisted on visas in a bid to force Bulgaria to sign an 
emigration accord to protect the rights of refugees and those ethnic Turks 
remaining in Bulgaria.

Five Palestinians died amid mounting violence in the Israeli-occupied 
territories Saturday, two of them in a shoot-out, and an Israeli soldier was 
killed by an infiltrator from Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
A terse army statement said soldiers killed two "terrorists" in a clash in the 
early hours, wounding and arresting three others. Palestinians said all five 
were wanted by security forces and some were armed. No soldiers were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Stone-throwing demonstrators in Nablus clashed with troops, and soldiers shot 
dead a 14-year-old girl and wounded 10 protesters, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The army then placed the city of 120,000 under curfew. 
</P>
<P>
In another aspect of the mounting violence, Palestinians said masked youths 
shot dead a 30-year-old Arab in the Gaza Strip town of Rafah. They had 
initially reported he was killed by the army. 
</P>
<P>
They said Abdullah Abu Shalouf was a drug dealer suspected of collaborating 
with the Israeli security services. An army spokeswoman said Shalouf's killing 
was a criminal matter being investigated by police. 
</P>
<P>
Three other alleged collaborators were killed Friday, apparently by 
Palestinians, pushing the number killed in inter-Arab violence to about 105. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem's Mokassed Hospital, Moustafa Hussein Dabah, 37, of Ramallah died 
of head wounds sustained a week ago when his car was stoned. Palestinians said 
Israeli settlers in the West Bank threw the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said the soldier was killed in a clash with a gunman who 
infiltrated across Israel's northeastern border with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
It said the intruder, dressed in civilian clothes and armed with an AK-47 rifle 
and a hand gun, was also killed in the morning clash at Kfar Ruppin, south of 
the Sea of Galilee, an army spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other soldiers were wounded in the clash and one was reported shot in the 
head and fighting for his life. 
</P>
<P>
On two previous occasions this year, gunmen have crossed the border with Jordan 
and carried out attacks inside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, told reporters at the scene that 
the identity and motive of the assailant were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"Jordan must find a way to prevent shootings or infiltration from its border 
and to maintain security along the border," he said.

IN REFORM MOVE, CHINA HIKES TRANSPORT PRICES 
</P>

<P>
The Chinese government Saturday took its most dramatic step in more than a year 
toward reform of the country's irrational pricing system, announcing sharp 
increases in transportation fares. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of train tickets, unchanged since 1958, will jump an average of 112%, 
while domestic air tickets will rise 77%, State Council spokesman Yuan Mu 
announced in a nationally televised speech. Fares on ships and ferries are to 
go up 96%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yuan, a close associate of Premier Li Peng, forcefully defended the price hikes 
as needed to cut government losses, fight illegal ticket scalping and cut 
overcrowding. The measures will promote the development of transportation 
infrastructure and the national economy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the increases, which take effect Tuesday, reinforces government 
assertions that some economic reforms will continue even in the wake of a 
year-old economic retrenchment program and the ascendancy in June of hard-line 
leaders who called in the army to end student-led protests demanding political 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
More sweeping price reforms, however, have a low priority in the current 
regime's short-term plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
26% Inflation in 1988 
</P>
<P>
The government has continued to emphasize a fight against inflation, which ran 
at an official rate of 26% last year, and reassertion of control over various 
aspects of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
It has particularly emphasized cutting non-essential construction projects, 
fighting tax evasion and trying to prevent companies from profiting by 
acquiring goods at low, state-controlled prices and reselling them at market 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Yuan said Saturday that there has been some initial success this year in 
battling inflation and that this makes the adjustment of transportation fares 
easier to carry out. He also said that all organizations have been forbidden to 
raise commodity prices on grounds of higher transportation costs. 
</P>
<P>
Government leaders have repeatedly said that the retrenchment program, now 
scheduled to last for another three years, is intended to create conditions for 
carrying out additional market-oriented reforms. Many Western analysts, 
however, believe that some high-ranking orthodox Marxists are trying to use the 
retrenchment program to stop or reverse the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li is suspected by some analysts of favoring Stalinist-style central 
planning, which has been only partially eliminated in China. Li has repeatedly 
denied this, and in a speech last month, he declared that all reforms 
previously approved by the Communist Party and government should be continued. 
Li was quoted by the official New China News Agency as specifically mentioning 
such cutting-edge reforms as commercialization of housing and creation of 
enterprise share-holding systems. Experiments in these areas should continue 
but "under careful control and step by step," Li said. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear, however, that Li and his closest associates in the government are 
far less enthusiastic about rapid market-oriented reforms than former Communist 
Party chief Zhao Ziyang, who was removed from office in June for refusing to 
use force against the student demonstrators.

China on Saturday rejected a resolution by a U.N. panel criticizing last June's 
suppression of this country's democracy movement, calling the resolution 
"illegal and null and void." 
</P>
<P>
"The resolution brazenly interfered in China's internal affairs, attempting to 
exert pressure on China," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement reported by 
the official New China news agency. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, the first by a U.N. body criticizing China since the crackdown 
on pro-democracy protesters, was approved Thursday in Geneva by the U.N. 
Subcommittee on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by Western nations and approved 15 to 9 by the panel, the resolution 
expressed "concern about the events" in China and "about their consequences in 
the field of human rights." It also appealed for clemency for people detained 
in the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement said that "only a very small number" of offenders 
had been punished for criminal offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Official reports say at least 4,000 people have been arrested since the 
crackdown, but Western and Chinese sources place the number as high as 30,000 
nationwide. Included are dozens of journalists, intellectuals and others 
detained without being charged.

BEIJING LIKELY TO TRIM NUMBER OF GRADUATE STUDENTS ABROAD 
</P>

<P>
The Chinese government has made a "preliminary decision" to reduce the number 
of graduate students sent for study abroad, an official newspaper reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In place of the young graduate students, an increased number of older scholars 
will be sent overseas for shorter visits on non-degree programs and exchanges, 
according to He Dongchang, vice minister of the State Education Commission, who 
was quoted by the China Daily. These older scholars are expected to make more 
rapid contributions to academic and economic development in China, He said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that students sent abroad should be directed into study of 
subjects applicable to China's modernization effort. 
</P>
<P>
The official's comments appeared to apply primarily to state-sponsored students 
and scholars. Chinese government agencies and institutions have been sending 
about 3,000 students abroad annually. Much larger numbers make their own 
arrangements to study abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, about 50,000 students and scholars have gone to the United 
States, while no more than about 10,000 have returned to China. The low rate of 
return has caused problems for China and for today's prospective students. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese institutions often suffer a net loss of talent as their brightest 
people extend their stays abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Students hoping to go abroad -- especially those who are not state sponsored -- 
often have their plans collapse at the last minute when they are refused U.S. 
visas. This is because American law requires U.S. embassies and consulates to 
deny student visas to anyone suspected of wanting to become an immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
The record of Chinese staying on in the United States has created a presumption 
that students who are young and single will not want to return to China. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister He said that progress in China's educational system over the past 
decade should enable it to train larger numbers of graduate students 
domestically. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged, however, that without improvements in the pay and living 
standards of intellectuals, it is difficult to encourage students to enter 
graduate school, or to attract students abroad to return. 
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that Chinese diplomatic missions may step up their efforts to 
influence Chinese students, with the aim of encouraging them to return to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
"He proposed," the China Daily reported, "that patient and painstaking 
ideological work be carried out among Chinese students overseas to inspire 
their patriotic enthusiasm."

VICTIM OF GANG SHOOTING DIES; 5 OTHERS HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A gang member wounded last month in a shooting has died from his injuries, and 
five people were injured in two gang-related shootings late Friday night and 
early Saturday morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Valente Orosco, 20, died Friday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of 
wounds he suffered in an Aug. 18 shooting in Los Angeles. Orosco was shot while 
standing in the 2900 block of West 14th Street in the mid-city area, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the latest rounds of gang violence, two suspected gang members were 
shot and wounded in an unincorporated area near Gardena as they walked out of 
the Barbary Coast club in the 143000 block of South Western Avenue about 10:30 
p.m. Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Four men emerged from behind the building and asked the two victims, "What's 
up, cuz?" an expression used to determine gang affiliation, said Sgt. Edward 
Allen of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects opened fire with a 9-millimeter pistol, and then the four 
men fled, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
The two victims, identified as Harrington McFrazier, 22, and Daniel Stapleton, 
23, both of Watts, staggered to a nearby fast-food restaurant, where employees 
called paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. McFrazier, 
who suffered wounds in the stomach and a leg, was listed Saturday in serious 
but stable condition, Allen said. Stapleton, who suffered wounds in a leg and a 
hand, was in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests had been made Saturday, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second shooting, two youths and a man walking near 3rd and Center 
streets in San Pedro were wounded shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday, when three men 
in a passing truck yelled "Waterfront Pirus," the name of a local gang, and 
opened fire, said Police Lt. Richard Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
The victims -- ages 15, 16 and 21 -- were struck by shotgun pellets, Gonzales 
said. Two rounds shattered a window of a nearby apartment but no one inside was 
hurt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the victims were taken to San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, and the third 
was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. All three were listed in 
serious but stable condition Saturday, Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, believed to be gang members, had not been arrested, Gonzales 
said.

The Soviet Union on Saturday detonated a nuclear explosion with a force of 20 
kilotons at a test site in Soviet Central Asia, the official Tass news agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the blast was set off at 8:17 a.m. at Semipalitinsk in Kazakhstan, 
1,700 miles southeast of Moscow, "to perfect military equipment." 
</P>
<P>
It said there was "an insignificant, brief rise in the radiation background" 
inside the test zone. Radiation levels outside the test range were normal, Tass 
said.

THE CONTESTED CASES: MEDICAL EXPERTS FAULT KING'S DOCTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of a months-long review of Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, 
The Times studied dozens of cases treated at the hospital during a recent 2 
1/2-year period. Four distinguished physicians outside Los Angeles County 
reviewed 12 cases for The Times at no charge. What follows are brief 
descriptions and a discussion of several of the cases they reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At 2:13 a.m. on Sept. 17, 1987, a 30-year-old woman arrived by ambulance at 
King's trauma center with a bullet lodged in her brain. 
</P>
<P>
The patient was a secretary employed by a Westside computer company who had 
been abducted at gunpoint from Los Angeles International Airport. She was 
gang-raped and terrorized for 12 hours before being shot in the head and dumped 
in the parking lot of a mini-market at 99th and South Figueroa streets in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Miraculously, she was conscious when she arrived at King. 
</P>
<P>
But during her stay there, the hospital failed to provide her with the prompt 
neurosurgical attention that trauma centers are required to give, according to 
the medical experts who reviewed her case. 
</P>
<P>
Through the night, the patient lingered without examination by a qualified 
attending neurosurgeon, according to her medical records and interviews with 
four King physicians familiar with her case. 
</P>
<P>
As dawn came, Dr. Harvie Dale Harrier, an attending surgeon, arrived at King to 
make his usual morning rounds. Upon discovering that the patient had not yet 
been seen by a neurosurgeon, he said he launched an effort to transfer her by 
helicopter to UCLA Medical Center for care. 
</P>
<P>
"In this specific case," Harrier recalled, "I came in and, to me, she needed 
care that I was not sure we could deliver at King." 
</P>
<P>
It was not an unusual situation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the trauma center lacked the neurosurgical capability to care for the 
patient, he said, "No comment." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard H. Cales, chief of emergency medicine at San Francisco General 
Hospital, said after reviewing the case: 
</P>
<P>
"The issue here is that the expertise of the attending (neurosurgeons) is 
simply not available. The system allowed a patient to be taken to a hospital 
that did not provide the service that she required and then could not transfer 
her in a timely manner. That is . . . scandalous." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. George Locke, chairman of neurosurgery at King, said he does not recall 
which neurosurgeon was on duty the night the patient arrived. But he said that 
he personally examined her in the morning. He said she did not need to be 
examined before then because she was conscious and in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the patient got good care and was appropriately treated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 hours after she was delivered to King by ambulance, the patient was 
transfered by helicopter to UCLA Medical Center, "due to a lack of surgical 
intensive care beds at MLK-Drew Medical Center at this time," according to her 
medical records. At UCLA, she successfully underwent five hours of brain 
surgery and is now almost fully recovered. She requested that her name be 
withheld. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Flores, a 28-year-old nurseryman, underwent routine surgery as an 
outpatient at King on April 21, 1987, to repair a hernia. 
</P>
<P>
Five days later, he was dead, leaving behind his wife and two young children, 
who have since filed a medical malpractice claim against the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Flores died from post-surgical infection of his wound that was not promptly 
diagnosed or treated by King physicians, despite his repeated complaints of 
pain and telltale symptoms of infection, according to the doctors who reviewed 
his medical records for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
After surgery to repair his hernia, Flores was sent home with instructions to 
report any discomfort, fever or pain. Twice, he came back to King's emergency 
room seeking care. 
</P>
<P>
During the first visit four days after the operation, records show, he had a 
fever, intestinal bleeding and a swollen groin. But a surgeon was not called to 
evaluate his condition. Instead, he was sent home. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 24 hours later, he returned to the emergency room. It was about 4 
a.m. on April 26, according to his medical records. This time, he was 
critically ill with a dangerously low blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
He lingered about 10 hours before he was finally seen by a surgeon, who 
concluded that Flores was suffering from a life-threatening infection requiring 
immediate surgery. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of being rushed to the operating room, Flores had to wait another 
six hours, finally dying on the operating table. 
</P>
<P>
The failure to recognize the patient's symptoms of infection, compounded by an 
inability to move swiftly once the problem was diagnosed, constitutes "flagrant 
malpractice," said Dr. Michael L. Callaham, chief of emergency medicine at the 
University of California's Moffitt-Long Hospital in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
During a deposition, the surgeon who repaired Flores' hernia, Dr. Kenneth Sim, 
acknowledged that Flores should have been admitted to the hospital for 
treatment the first time he reported to the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arthur Fleming, King's chief of trauma and surgery, who did not personally 
treat Flores, also acknowledged that Flores waited "a long time" for care. He 
said the delay was "not acceptable" given the emergency nature of his 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Castellanos, 31, and eight months pregnant, was rushed to King's trauma 
center the afternoon of March 10, 1987, after she was injured in an automobile 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors in the emergency room quickly assessed the woman's condition -- and 
also detected the baby's heartbeat. Records show that they ordered the woman 
admitted to an obstetrical ward and placed on a fetal monitor to safeguard the 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
But 12 hours later, the woman was still languishing, unmonitored, in the 
emergency room. The baby's heartbeat could no longer be detected, and the 
infant was born dead. 
</P>
<P>
Cales said, "Nobody ever took the case in hand . . . and did what had to be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
He said the patient apparently "got lost in the ER (emergency room)." 
</P>
<P>
Callaham agreed that the patient encountered an "inordinate delay. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"She got lost in limbo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ezra Davidson, chairman of King's department of obstetrics, declined 
comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Hodge, 74, was injured in a traffic accident the morning of Nov. 20, 1987. 
She was promptly rushed by ambulance to King's trauma center, where she was 
held for several hours, examined and released with instructions to take some 
aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
At home, about nine hours later, she lost control of her bowels, became 
unconscious and was rushed back to King, where she died almost immediately from 
massive internal injuries and bleeding that had gone untreated during her 
initial emergency room visit. She suffered from third and fifth rib fractures, 
multiple bruises, a lacerated liver and internal bleeding, according to an 
autopsy report. 
</P>
<P>
Cales, at San Francisco General Hospital, faulted King's physicians for failing 
during their initial examination of the patient to frequently monitor her vital 
signs or to order tests that might well have detected her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The failure to diagnose her problem, he added, is "clearly unacceptable in a 
trauma center." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming, King's trauma chief, commented after reviewing Hodge's medical records 
that if the patient had gone to a hospital with more resources and fewer 
patients, she "would have gone into a critical-care room" instead of being 
discharged to her home. He called her death an "unfortunate loss" and said she 
appears to have "slipped through the cracks" because emergency room physicians 
released her without first calling trauma surgeons to evaluate her condition. 
</P>
<P>
"For good trauma management," he acknowledged, surgeons should be called to 
examine all traffic accident victims.

The government Saturday freed about 60 members of the banned Communist Party 
detained since April on suspicion of inciting price riots, police officials 
said.

<P>
The Communists were rounded up April 20, accused of distributing leaflets

You're a natural beauty Meant to be free Pretty as a picture You're my canyon 
to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Rushing, "Natural Beauty" 
</P>
<P>
Jim Rushing is a leather worker by trade, selling his handmade shoes, belts and 
bags out of the small shop in Laguna Beach that he runs with his wife, Linda. 
But he also fancies himself a songwriter and has been composing tunes for about 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Rushing put his thoughts on the Laguna Canyon and other 
environmental concerns to music. He handed the compositions to his friend Mark 
Kenoly, who went into a studio and came out with a tape of the songs in slick 
pop and jazz arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, Rushing has been selling copies of the tape, "Great Things," at 
special events and through Laguna Beach music shops. They are stamped with 
"Save the Canyon" stickers and generally are displayed alongside brochures for 
the Laguna Canyon Conservancy, an activist group that is working to block 
several planned developments in the canyon. So far, about 300 tapes have sold 
at $10 each. Half the proceeds go to the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to express the beauty of the canyon," says Rushing, who has 
become a director of the conservancy, coordinating much of its merchandising 
effort. "It was very easy to write the lyrics." 
</P>
<P>
Other artists and craftsmen in Laguna Beach, which has long lived off its 
reputation as an artists' colony, have joined in aiding the canyon preservation 
effort. Some have donated proceeds from artworks, some have donated T-shirt and 
greeting card designs, and musicians have performed for free at public 
gatherings. Others have put their brushes aside to do the all-important 
political work: organizing, reading environmental impact reports, writing 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
Even the beach city's popular summer art festivals have gotten into the act. 
The Sawdust Festival donated booth space to the conservancy this summer, while 
the Laguna Festival of Arts gave $10,000 to help underwrite "The Tell," a giant 
photomural that stretches along a portion of Laguna Canyon Road, providing a 
rallying point for canyon activists. 
</P>
<P>
"Art is a very powerful tool of discovery," Rushing says. "We actually have 
very few other tools at our disposal." 
</P>
<P>
"The Tell" sits at a point where the proposed San Joaquin Hills Transportation 
Corridor, a 14-mile tollway linking Newport Beach and San Juan Capistrano, 
would cross Laguna Canyon Road. A sign, funded by the city of Laguna Beach, 
informs travelers that the tollway would be 800 feet wide and more than 40 feet 
high at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Around a bend is the site of the proposed Laguna Laurel project, where the 
Irvine Co. hopes to build more than 3,000 homes, 82 acres of commercial 
development and a 276-acre private golf course. Right now, there are no homes 
or businesses in the canyon's largely pristine upper end. 
</P>
<P>
Many area residents want to keep it that way. Laguna Laurel and the 
transportation corridor are two main targets of the conservancy, a relatively 
new and political offshoot of the long-established Laguna Greenbelt Inc. With 
"The Tell," where the conservancy maintains an information booth, activists 
have been able to draw people to the site and to explain their side of the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"People will come out to 'The Tell' because they're curious," says Linda 
Eckmann, a conservancy director in charge of membership. When passers-by are 
told of the development plans, Eckmann says, "their mouths drop open." 
</P>
<P>
"We've picked up, I think, a lot of people that way. . . . If we get 10 more 
people going to a meeting, that's fantastic. If we get 10 more letters being 
written, that's fantastic too." 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at the mural grows and ebbs. During the summer art festival season, 
which ended Sunday, sometimes as many as 100 would gather there late in the 
afternoon as they made their way home. At other times, even during free 
concerts, it's been almost deserted. But Mark Chamberlain, a co-organizer of 
the project, guesses that the number of people who have visited so far has been 
in the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
"The Tell" has further helped spread the group's message via newspaper and 
magazine coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a public relations budget, so we can't advertise," says Ken 
Kube, a conservancy volunteer. But the project -- a plywood backdrop shaped to 
correspond to the surrounding hills, plastered with donated family snapshots -- 
has been given national exposure in Life magazine and has been the focus of 
dozens of local articles. 
</P>
<P>
The Guiness Book of World Records has promised to check a claim that "The Tell" 
is the world's largest photomural. And with every mention, Kube notes, "we get 
our story out." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a protest piece," says Chamberlain. "It's a very positive 
piece. . . . This is about people having fun." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of the mural is to depict family life as it exists now, without a huge 
road through the canyon, without yet another mega-development. The people and 
places and things in the pictures and the trees and fields surrounding "The 
Tell" are all part of the same environment, an environment that's threatened. 
If these projects go through, that environment changes, and at least some of it 
dies. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The Tell' is one of the most poetic things I've ever experienced," says 
Eckmann. "All those little captured moments -- I think it is absolute poetry." 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's really a reflection of the human spirit," Kube adds. "If we want 
to stop the corridor, stop Laguna Laurel, we need that spirit." 
</P>
<P>
But whether the project has helped change the minds of developers and planners 
is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
One answer of sorts came this week in the form of two environmental reports 
from the county planning department. 
</P>
<P>
One calls for the transformation of Laguna Canyon Road north of El Toro Road 
from a meandering two-lane country road into a major arterial highway that 
would connect to the Transportation Corridor. The other would clear the way for 
most of the Laguna Laurel project. Residents have 45 days to comment on the 
reports before the projects go before county supervisors, who will approve or 
reject them. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Johnson, a county planner who worked on the reports, recommends that 
opponents keep pursuing the usual channels: writing letters, attending meetings 
and responding to the environmental impact reports. But, he said, symbolic 
gestures such as "The Tell" are hard to accommodate in the highly formalized 
planning process. 
</P>
<P>
"Government can't respond to everything," Johnson said. "Government doesn't 
even know everything that's out there." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we are aware of 'The Tell,' " said Donna Stubbs, public affairs manager 
for the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency, whose members have 
met with co-organizer Chamberlain. "In a broad sense," she said, the concerns 
expressed in the installation "are certainly taken note of, I would say." 
</P>
<P>
Aesthetics are accommodated in the planning process, she added, along with 
archeological, historical and wildlife concerns. 
</P>
<P>
She said many of the claims made by canyon activists are untrue or misleading: 
The "800 foot" width mentioned on the city's sign reflects only one plan under 
consideration. The currently preferred alternative would be just half that -- 
400 feet -- at its widest point and would average about 180 feet -- three lanes 
in each direction and a median with two reversible car-pool lanes and space for 
mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co., meanwhile, withheld comment on "The Tell" because, according to 
a spokesman, "none of the key people" on the Laguna Laurel project has seen the 
mural yet. 
</P>
<P>
"It would please me to no end if (Irvine Co. chairman) Donald Bren would care 
to come here and sit down in this meadow and look at what people have done," 
Chamberlain says as he fiddles with an unlit cigarette. "Maybe I should send 
him an invitation." 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain, who directed "The Tell" with former BC Space Gallery partner Jerry 
Burchfield, is sitting on a bench at the far end of the photomural -- 636 feet 
from the road, to be exact -- a straw hat shielding his eyes from the bright 
afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
While he hopes those who hold the keys to the canyon's future -- planners, 
landowners, politicians -- will be moved by "The Tell" to heed its message, 
realistically he believes the project will have an indirect effect at best. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a flag, if you will, something to rally around. . . . People have been 
thirsting for a direct way to express their feelings." The mural is due to be 
torn down at the end of this month, but Chamberlain hopes to persuade the city 
to let it stand until February, when insurance on the site runs out. 
</P>
<P>
"The Tell" is the latest phase in the Laguna Canyon Project, an ongoing 
artistic and documentary exploration of the canyon that Chamberlain and 
Burchfield launched in 1980. At first, "The Tell" was conceived as a huge 
Cibachrome mural, but the specialized method of color photographic printing 
would have been enormously costly. The idea of using donated photos for the 
mural first was conceived as a way to save money. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be the absolute right way to do it," Chamberlain says. 
Instead of a private studio project, the project became a very public effort, 
"a town meeting disguised as a work of art" in the words of Times art critic 
Cathy Curtis. Thousands of people donated photographs; hundreds more helped 
paste the pictures to the plywood support structure. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain says that many of the passers-by who stopped to peer at the 
snapshots told him they had never really thought about environmental and 
development issues in the canyon, which which he says refutes any argument that 
the project is preaching to the converted. 
</P>
<P>
Many people today "almost think that if it's an open piece of ground, it must 
be developed," Chamberlain says. The main purpose of the "The Tell" is "to get 
people involved in the question" of how to shape the future of Laguna Canyon 
and, in a larger sense, involved in the issue of the human relationship to the 
land." 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a very potent environmental statement," Chamberlain says. "If 
nothing else, we've succeeded in getting people 636 feet off that road. Some 
people have never done that before."

RANDY LEWIS: BROWNE COULD USE (NEIL) YOUNG VOICE; 
</P>
<P>
WHILE BOTH ARE HEAVILY INTO MESSAGE MUSIC, ONE DOES IT WITH POETRY, THE OTHER 
WITH A BLUDGEON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a recent review of Jackson Browne's passionately political new album "World 
in Motion," I irritated some of Browne's passionately loyal fans by complaining 
that with few exceptions, the whole effort, however well intentioned, unreels 
like Newsweek-on-tape. 
</P>
<P>
Filled with songs about the plight of the homeless, about political corruption 
at home and abroad, and about the insensitivity of First-World "haves" toward 
Third-World "have-notes," the album forces you to reconsider whether complex 
international and domestic issues can or even should be reduced to four-minute 
rock 'n' roll songs. 
</P>
<P>
It's what another writer was getting at in a review of a Moody Blues album 
several years ago, when he described their songwriting style as the 
"wrap-up-the-universe-in-three-choruses-and-a-bridge" school. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that I've become less tolerant or more conservative over the years; 
philosophically, I agree with most of the positions Browne takes in his songs. 
It's the way he states them, the way he seems more like a TV news commentator 
or an ardent preacher than a songwriter. His concert last weekend at Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre only reinforced that feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Proving the converse -- that pop stars can be equally effective as rockers and 
as spokesmen and women for social concerns -- Neil Young performed at the 
Pacific Amphitheatre the week before Browne, launching what looks to be one of 
the most formidable tours of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Browne's problem is that he can't translate deeply felt worries into credible 
lyrics. In "How Long," for instance, he poses a perfectly legitimate question: 
</P>
<P>
How long can you hear someone 
</P>
<P>
crying 
</P>
<P>
How long can you ear someone 
</P>
<P>
dying 
</P>
<P>
Before you ask yourself why? 
</P>
<P>
 Timeless as that query may be, as a song it's a pallid recycling of Bob 
Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind." Dylan's composition turned into a rallying cry 
for the civil-rights and the anti-war movements of the '60s; its rhetorical 
questions ("How many times must a man look up/Before he sees the sky?/How many 
ears must one man have/Before he can hear people cry?/How many deaths will it 
take till he knows/That too many people have died?") crystallize dilemmas that 
always have and always will dog humankind. 
</P>
<P>
With Browne, it's when he rails at his most earnest -- and there's no doubting 
the sincerity of his convictions -- that he falls hardest. 
</P>
<P>
I come here for Dr. King 
</P>
<P>
Who gave the people a precious 
</P>
<P>
thing... 
</P>
<P>
And I come here to praise Mandela 
</P>
<P>
And to send this message to his 
</P>
<P>
jailer... 
</P>
<P>
We come here to sing for freedom 
</P>
<P>
And to send our voices to the ones 
</P>
<P>
who need them. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom for South Africa 
</P>
<P>
And justice for Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson Mandela probably welcomes any and every voice that joins the chorus 
chanting for his release, but rhyming "sing for freedom" with "ones who need 
them"? Egad. (Not that rhyming "Mandela"" and "jailer" would have won this guy 
any William Blake awards.) Beyond that, the song, "When the Stone Begins to 
Turn," strings together slogans more befitting protesters' placards. It simply 
doesn't tell us anything we haven't heard (or seen on TV news reports) before. 
</P>
<P>
Where is the perspective, the new light that only an artist can bring to a 
familiar situation? 
</P>
<P>
On Browne's album, ironically, it is found in one of the two songs he didn't 
write: "My Personal Revenge," by Tomas Borge and Louis Enrique Mejia Godoy, 
composers who cry out for gentle victory in the war against oppression: 
</P>
<P>
My personal revenge will be the 
</P>
<P>
right 
</P>
<P>
Of our children in the schools and 
</P>
<P>
in the gardens. 
</P>
<P>
My personal revenge will be to 
</P>
<P>
give you 
</P>
<P>
This song which has flourished 
</P>
<P>
without panic... 
</P>
<P>
My personal revenge will be to tell 
</P>
<P>
you 'Good morning' 
</P>
<P>
On a street without beggars or 
</P>
<P>
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a political statement, but it's also poetry -- poetry born of 
inequality and suffering, a combination that surfaces far too infrequently for 
the ardent Jackson Browne. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Young, on the other hand, is every bit as angry over social and political 
injustice in his new album "Freedom." But compared to Browne and his studied, 
politically correct editorializing, Young has transformed his wrath into 
inspired Philippics that consistently jab, sometimes frighteningly so, at the 
listener, not merely at the evil-doer. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons Young's new material carries such punch is that he hasn't 
stuck to easy political stances over the years. Just a few years ago, he was 
endorsing Ronald Reagan for President -- a move that assuredly got his name X'd 
off the "A" lists for most entertainment-world soirees. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is again examining our dearly held notions of "freedom," both the up and 
the downsides that have emerged during this country's 200-plus years. In 
"Rockin' in the Free World," the cornerstone song of the album, Young paints a 
bleak picture of life on the streets of urban America with such moral outrage 
that it's easy to miss the artistic skill he uses to focus his revulsion: 
</P>
<P>
I see a girl in the night 
</P>
<P>
With a baby in her hand 
</P>
<P>
Under an old street light 
</P>
<P>
Near a garbage can. 
</P>
<P>
Now she puts the kid away 
</P>
<P>
And she's gone to get a hit. 
</P>
<P>
She hates her life 
</P>
<P>
And what she's done to it. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a stunning bit of songwriting already, and Young put it across at the 
Pacific Amphitheatre in an explosive rendition backed by nothing but his own 
acoustic guitar. And he turns the flame up several more notches in the next 
verse, as he assesses the result of a life decision made out of desperation: 
</P>
<P>
That's one more kid 
</P>
<P>
That will never go to school 
</P>
<P>
Never get to fall in love 
</P>
<P>
Never get to be cool. 
</P>
<P>
Keep on rockin' in the free world. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting snide emphasis on the word cool, Young in a single syllable pierced 
the heart of a culture where being "cool" is often placed above common sense, 
family commitment or individual integrity. 
</P>
<P>
And that was just for openers. 
</P>
<P>
"Crime in the City (Sixty to Zero Part 1)" nattily rejects easy stereotypes, 
both left and right: that criminals are either hapless victims of circumstance 
or the source of all of society's ills and that the police are either heartless 
usurpers of power or faultless supermen handcuffed by a criminal-kissing legal 
system. 
</P>
<P>
'There's still crime in the city,' 
</P>
<P>
Said the cop on the beat. 
</P>
<P>
'I don't know if I can stop it, 
</P>
<P>
I feel like meat on the street... 
</P>
<P>
That's why I'm doin' it my way. 
</P>
<P>
I took the law in my hands. 
</P>
<P>
So here I am in the alleyway, 
</P>
<P>
A wad of cash in my pants. 
</P>
<P>
I get paid by a 10-year-old, 
</P>
<P>
He says he looks up to me. 
</P>
<P>
There's still crime in the city 
</P>
<P>
But it's good to be free' 
</P>
<P>
 Now that's rage at a world in which it seems that all the old rules, the old 
tenets about truth, justice and the American way, have fallen by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
And, equally important, it's a great song.

O.C. TACKLES 'WHOLE LANGUAGE' REFORM; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS CLOSING BOOK ON 'DICK AND JANE' ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
When Orange County's 28 school districts open for the fall semester this week, 
students and their teachers will return to a near-revolution in education. 
</P>
<P>
From high school accounting classes to elementary school art courses, a 
fundamental change is taking place in schools this year in the way children 
learn to read and write. Called the "whole language" approach to education, it 
is part of a series of statewide reforms. And for one thing, it means no more 
"Dick and Jane." 
</P>
<P>
Spelling and grammar textbooks are out. Whole literary works are in for 
elementary schoolchildren. High school students will have to do more writing in 
all their classes, from industrial arts to physical education. 
</P>
<P>
"We no longer will have a (primer) that has stuff like, 'See Spot run,' or that 
asks you five spelling words," said Dennis Gibbs, director of elementary 
education for Irvine Unified School District. "There no longer will be a 
vocabulary list that every fifth-grader should know. Now, you will read a piece 
of literature, and within that context you learn spelling words, you learn 
vocabulary." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back to Basics 
</P>
<P>
This new approach is part of the state's back-to-basics reforms, which call for 
changes in the language arts curriculum this year. Some school districts are 
implementing the program in stages, but in just about every Orange County 
district, teachers have been preparing for the new wave by attending workshops 
and seminars all summer. 
</P>
<P>
As teachers last week readied new lesson plans and attended one last seminar on 
the sweeping reforms before the opening of school, administrators grappled with 
other pressing issues, such as growth. Enrollment overall in county schools 
will increase by nearly 2%, to 353,522, but it marks the sixth consecutive year 
of growth in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
For Capistrano Unified School District in the fast-growing South County, it 
meant adding 52 portable classrooms, or the equivalent of two elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"South County is booming, there's no getting around it," said Jackie Cerra, 
spokeswoman for the Capistrano district, where enrollment this fall is 
projected to jump 8% over last year, making it one of the fastest growing 
districts in Orange County. (Placentia Unified leads the county with a 
projected growth this fall of 9%, but much of that is attributed to its merger 
with Yorba Linda School District.) 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana Unified School District, the county's largest, is opening a new 
high school -- the all high-tech Century High in southeastern Santa Ana -- as 
part of an ambitious building plan to accommodate continued growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
South County Growth 
</P>
<P>
And the problem of growth is expected to get worse before it gets better. A 
state report released two weeks ago that examined birth rates and population 
trends predicts Orange County school enrollment will soar 27% in the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Yet at the other end of the scale, a handful of Orange County districts are 
suffering from a decade of deep declines in enrollment, and as a result, are 
struggling to make ends meet without cutting into educational programs. 
Huntington Beach Union High School District, for example, will begin the school 
year with about 50 fewer teachers than last year. The cutbacks -- both through 
attrition and laying off of temporary teachers -- has prompted students and 
parents to protest that many of the school's best and brightest teachers were 
leaving, jeopardizing arts and science programs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the biggest change facing students and their teachers this year is the 
new emphasis on reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
The subjects aren't new to schools, of course. But this year, spelling, grammar 
and phonics no longer will be taught separately; instead, they will be taught 
as part of learning to read books or excerpts from literary works. And students 
will be have to write about what they learn. At both junior high and high 
school levels, writing and more reading will be emphasized throughout the 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
For the Garden Grove Unified School District, the reforms meant spending $1.5 
million to buy all new textbooks for language arts throughout the schools. And 
these new books are, for the most part, anthologies of literature, not texts 
produced for the express purpose of teaching a particular skill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reading-Writing Emphasis 
</P>
<P>
Last year, four Garden Grove schools instituted the new curriculum as a pilot 
program. Now, every school in the district will emphasize reading and writing. 
And writing will be emphasized in every class, not just in courses in language 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all using writing as a tool for learning, because writing mirrors 
thinking," Michael Carr, a writing specialist who is also a teacher in 
Carlsbad, told a group of 45 Garden Grove teachers at one workshop last week. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing wrong in the way you and I were taught, but there was an 
over-reliance on testing, an over-reliance on short answers," Carr told them. 
"You need to know that what we got was an emphasis on editing skills, not on 
thinking skills." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Carr said, teachers should be making assignments that encourage 
creativity and challenge thinking in all subject areas. 
</P>
<P>
Even in her computer and business accounting classes, teacher Benita Dill of La 
Quinta High School in the Garden Grove district said the new curriculum will be 
evident. 
</P>
<P>
"Take accounting: You might ask the students to write about the difference 
between manual accounting and computerized accounting; and why they think one 
method is better than the other," she said. "We don't want them just 
regurgitating something. We want them to show us, not just tell us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Work for Teachers 
</P>
<P>
The new curriculum also means more work for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
More writing means more papers to grade, Dill said. If a teacher has 150 
students a week, the workload can be formidable. For some, it also may mean 
rewriting lesson plans they have relied on for years. 
</P>
<P>
"In Garden Grove, the staff is getting older, and I would imagine that there is 
some resistance to this," she said. "It's a lot of work, and I know some 
teachers are looking at some of the models and saying, 'Oh, my God, I've got 
enough to do already.' " 
</P>
<P>
The whole-language approach signals a swing of the educational pendulum from 
the methods of the '70s, when reading and writing was taught by breaking the 
task into small, measurable skills such as diagraming sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Educators say poor test scores showed what a dismal failure that approach was. 
And a 1985 national study, "On Becoming a Nation of Readers," revealed that 70% 
of the reading time in elementary classrooms was devoted to tasks such as 
filling in blanks or underlining answers on work sheets. 
</P>
<P>
A key aim of the new approach is to teach writing skills within the context of 
real literature, said Susan Despenas, deputy administrator in the elementary 
division for Santa Ana Unified, which is spending $38 per elementary student on 
anthologies. 
</P>
<P>
"We want kids to love to read -- that's the bottom line," Despenas said. "In 
order to do that, they have to learn to appreciate literature. We want to make 
them lifelong readers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wanting More' 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Unified's Gibbs said the materials used in school should leave the 
students wanting more. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't even pass out the books (on) the first day of school. We want to 
explain to them what they're getting, because we want them to get excited," he 
said. "We want parents to say, 'My child is dying to get that book and start 
reading.' Maybe this will be the first time in recent memory where that is 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs said they hope to "encourage children to listen, to speak, to write and 
to think when they are interacting with literature." 
</P>
<P>
"The intent is to make reading and this whole process come alive -- to make it 
as exciting for children as it is for people who are avid readers when they 
enjoy reading a good piece of literature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Capistrano Unified schools, teachers will be reading from 3-by-3-foot 
versions of books such as "Amelia Bedelia" for second-graders or "Horton 
Hatches the Egg" for first-graders, while students follow in their own, smaller 
versions of the same book. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, they might listen to tape recordings that explore some of the 
phonics used in the stories, or work on computers to compose stories, with 
first-graders using phonetic spellings where they have to, said Bill Eller, 
assistant superintendent in charge of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Risk-Free Environment' 
</P>
<P>
"We want to teach them to write in a risk-free environment," he said, 
explaining that spelling will be emphasized more in second grade and beyond. 
"They (first-graders) can read their own stories beautifully, even if we can't 
understand them, and children can read each other's stories, and they make 
absolutely perfect sense." 
</P>
<P>
In Eller's view, it's time that teaching methods for reading and writing caught 
up with the complex world of fast-paced communication in which today's children 
live. 
</P>
<P>
"Many teachers have taught reading or learned to read the way you and I did -- 
'See Dick Run.' But if you think about that concept for a moment, it's very 
simplistic way to look at the world, in three-word sentences," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is this complex world out there and these kids can absorb it. Kids can 
communicate in the sophisticated world and they operate quite nicely. But 
somehow, with the (old style textbooks), we restrict them."

MAN REPORTEDLY SEEN LEAVING HOME WITH BODY IS ARRESTED IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 31-year-old man was arrested Saturday in Orange on suspicion of murdering his 
girlfriend after he returned home to find police called by neighbors who 
reported seeing him leave his apartment carrying a sleeping bag with a body 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
Police found the body of the woman, whose identity was being withheld pending 
notification of relatives, in the trunk of Michael Raymond Goodson's car after 
he pulled up in front of his apartment complex about 6 p.m. Police said the 
girlfriend, 41, lived in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators talked to Goodson for a while, then opened the trunk of his car 
and made their grisly discovery. After taking photographs of the woman, who 
apparently had been strangled, officers sealed up the trunk and waited for 
coroner's officials to arrive. Goodson, a parts driver for an auto dealership, 
was arrested at the scene and taken to Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not combative," said Orange Police Sgt. Art Romo. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors say that nearly 12 hours earlier, they watched Goodson walk out of 
his apartment with a body of a woman covered by a sleeping bag, according to 
police. Goodson hefted the load down a short pathway, placed it in the trunk of 
his car and then drove off, neighbors told police. 
</P>
<P>
Residents alerted the Orange Police Department, but when officers arrived and 
broke into the ground-floor unit they found neither a victim nor a suspect, 
only traces of blood. 
</P>
<P>
Goodson apparently lived in the apartment with his father, who police believe 
had gone to San Francisco for the weekend. Police were also trying to reach the 
father, whose identity they did not disclose. 
</P>
<P>
No one reported hearing a fight in the apartment, which sits on a corner of the 
sprawling complex just yards from a gate out to the carport. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Worthley, a 16-year-old neighbor who lives in an apartment that shares a 
wall with Goodson's, said he got home at 12:30 a.m. Saturday but didn't hear a 
sound until he awakened mid-morning to find police throughout the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear anything, and these walls are pretty thin," said Worthley, who 
does not know Goodson. 
</P>
<P>
After police were unable to find Goodson or a victim in the apartment during 
their preliminary search, they closed up the apartment and spent much of 
Saturday attempting to get a court order to conduct a thorough look. As curious 
neighbors looked on, the area around the unit at the Park City Apartments, in 
the 3800 block of Garden Grove Boulevard, was cordoned off. 
</P>
<P>
Goodson was a stranger to most of his neighbors at the complex, a lush setting 
of plants spread between tan, wood-frame buildings with brown trim and 
aqua-blue doors. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I hear, he was sort of on the odd-ball side," said David White, who 
has lived in the complex for six years. "I heard one guy who parked next to him 
say he'd park his car sideways on day, then lengthwise the next." 
</P>
<P>
Denyce Fernando said that she saw Goodson occasionally but that he appeared 
"very quiet" and seemed the type that simply "went to work and came home" 
without much of a stir.

LAGUNA BEACH CLASS OF '69 REUNITES TO LOOK AT WHO THEY USED TO BE; 
</P>
<P>
TIME IT WAS AND WHAT A TIME IT WAS. A TIME OF INNOCENCE. A TIME OF CONFIDENCES. 
-- SIMON AND GARFUNKEL, "BOOKENDS" 
</P>

<P>
It was a time of Vietnam, hallucinogenic drugs and protests. 
</P>
<P>
It was a time of growing up for the class of 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach High School's class of '69 gathered again Saturday, 20 years after 
its members stood together at the Irvine Bowl and graduated. Under the shadow 
of a bright-yellow canopy, they held a reunion picnic at Blue Bird Park, a 
patch of grass a few blocks away from their alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
Long gone are the beads, the tie-dyed T-shirts and worn blue jeans. Instead, 
there were children to be held, faces to be recognized, and business cards to 
be handed out. 
</P>
<P>
There were early arrivers such as Robert Carey, a self-described former 
"hippie" and now a general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
As a high school student, Carey ran for class president each year so he could 
skip classes to campaign. He lost every time. 
</P>
<P>
Carey experimented with drugs, trying LSD for the first time during his junior 
year. Back then, his red hair reached his shoulders and he roamed the halls and 
classrooms in sandals and beads. On Saturday, Carey wore dockers and a 
calculator watch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High School Was a Blur 
</P>
<P>
His four years of high school were a blur, Carey confessed, because what was 
going on outside the classroom seemed so much more important. 
</P>
<P>
There were friends going to war and friends protesting the war. There was man's 
first walk on the moon, and there were riots. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned to question the air that I breathe, the food that I ate, the wars we 
fought," Carey said. 
</P>
<P>
Some stayed away from the haze. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon M. Brown, who is now director of disaster emergency services for Orange 
County's chapter of the American Red Cross, described himself as a "skinny kid 
with brains." He said he felt more like a bystander in those days than a 
participant. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a tiny part of what the whole country was going through. It was so 
confusing, scary, chaotic. It was everything at once, and we were the ones 
going through it all." 
</P>
<P>
Alexis Sedoff brought her two teen-age sons and her mother to the picnic. Both 
her children had heard about the days when their mother preferred Led Zeppelin 
to the classical music she now teaches. They know she had experimented with 
drugs, that she tried LSD at 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I've become a liberal mom. I tell them it's not worth taking the drugs. I 
know; I've tried them," Sedoff said. 
</P>
<P>
As a high school student, she didn't think about what she was going to do after 
graduation, said Sedoff, a piano teacher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Time to Think' 
</P>
<P>
"There was so much happening then. There was no time to think of my future." 
</P>
<P>
During the picnic, grandmothers sat on park benches a little apart from the 
reunion, spectators again to their grown children. Louise Sedoff, Alexis' 
mother, described 1969 as "terrible." 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky they all turned out as well as they did," she said. "But I had 
faith in all of them. Look, they all turned out pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the 235 students of the class of 1969 had known each other since 
they were kids. About 60 of them came to the picnic, many with their children. 
Some have kept in touch, but those who haven't appeared to remember each other 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
Iola Oliver, 38, an assistant manager for a glass manufacturing company, 
brought her son, John, to show off. Oliver was one of only two black students 
in the class. She was a cheerleader who could fit in with all of the groups. 
She didn't feel different from her classmates, she said, because she had known 
most of them since kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until she went to an amusement park with classmate Gary Graham that 
she knew the times still needed changing. On one ride, she held hands with 
Graham, and they were both stunned when people stared at them. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one of those times when I knew I stood out as a black person," Oliver 
said. "But other times, I never felt different from anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Long ago it must be. I have a photograph. Preserve your memories. They're all 
that's left you. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Simon and Garfunkel 
</P>
<P>
There are those missing from the reunion. Those who couldn't make it. Those who 
didn't want to come. Those who have died. Their photos were sought in the 
yearbook for remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
"A few of us messed up. A few of us died. But most of us carried on, kept up 
the dream of those times," Carey said. 
</P>
<P>
But at the picnic, the former classmates dwelled on more innocent memories, of 
chemistry classes, field trips, and who dated whom. 
</P>
<P>
They remembered the day they marched one by one to an outdoor stage to receive 
their diplomas. Clayton Slentz had hidden a white dove under his graduation 
gown. On stage, he released the dove, which flew over the class.

SUMMER MONTHS HAVE BEEN A LOT HOTTER THAN PEOPLE IN SOUTHLAND REALIZE, 
FORECASTERS INSIST 
</P>

The merchandise isn't all that's brief this summer at Akbar Afredi's bikini 
stand. Summer itself has been on the skimpy side. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather has been cool and nobody's been buying," said Afredi, who in 
summers past has sold as much as $800 worth of bikinis on a single hot day. 
This summer, he has gone home at night more than once after selling only one or 
two swimsuits at his Venice Beach store. 
</P>
<P>
"Cool weather is fine for the wintertime, but not the summer," he said last 
week as he marked down his stock, hoping to clean out his 320-suit inventory 
over the Labor Day weekend -- the traditional end of the summer season. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the goose bumps that this summer has given Afredi and other sun 
lovers, the past three months have been hotter than usual. 
</P>
<P>
"It's actually been two-tenths of a degree above normal for June, July and 
August," said meteorologist Rick Dittmann of Weather Data Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. "We tend to remember the most recent weather, so if 
it's been persistently cool for a few weeks, we say, 'Gosh, it's been a cool 
summer.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Average High Was 71.7 Degrees 
</P>
<P>
Cloudy morning weather during much of August kept the area from warming as it 
usually does each afternoon, Dittmann said. The average high temperature each 
day in Santa Ana was 71.7, contrasted with a normal maximum reading of 73.3, 
according to Weather Data. 
</P>
<P>
The "normal" temperature is calculated on the basis of 30 years of readings 
collected between 1951 and 1980, Dittmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Recent morning cloudiness has been caused by a low-pressure trough that extends 
from Alaska to Southern California. The low-pressure area, about 700 miles west 
of California and about 20,000 feet up, forms a thick cloud bank -- known as 
the "marine layer" -- at sea level that is pushed inland during nighttime and 
morning hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That gives the sun less time to heat everything up during the day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Phil La Casto, owner of Aqua Pool Center in Orange, hasn't missed the typical 
summer extremes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to take care of pools when people aren't swimming as heavily," 
said La Casto, whose pool service maintains about 300 home pools. "When it's 
100 degrees, then there are algae and chemical problems. And people swim a lot 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Although business typically levels off after Labor Day, La Casto predicted a 
final September steamer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be surprised if we don't see at least one more heat wave," he said. "I 
don't need it, so I'm not counting on it. We take care of the pools either 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the temperature drop has been slight, lifeguard Dan Dorsey said he 
has noticed a decrease in the size of crowds at Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, he said, about 8,800 people on a weekday pack the parking lots. But 
not lately. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days it is very crowded. And on other days, it isn't at all. But it 
doesn't seem to have anything to do with the weather," Dorsey said. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, forecasters say, should be better. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect 19 sunny days in September," said Betty Reo, a weather specialist at 
the National Weather Service. "Sunshine should prevail, with less coastal 
cloudiness than in the summer."

12 MEN ARRESTED IN PROSTITUTION SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve men were arrested on suspicion of soliciting a prostitute in a Friday 
night sweep of Harbor Boulevard north of the San Diego Freeway in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested after allegedly propositioning two female undercover 
officers who were decoys in "Operation Bellhop," according to Lt. Gary Webster. 
The police operation in the past has concentrated on prostitution and drug 
arrests, particularly at hotels along Harbor, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many customers for those arrested," Webster said. "Once arrests 
began taking place, those in the area could see what was going on. They took 
off."

POLICE SEEK TO IDENTIFY BODY FOUND IN IRVINE APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police continued to search for clues Saturday after the discovery of a badly 
decomposed body in an Irvine apartment rented by a woman who has been missing 
for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine police found the body Friday while investigating the disappearance of 
Eileen Margaret Casey, 55, who had not appeared at work since Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was conducted Saturday, but the body was so badly decomposed that 
the identity can only be determined after a review of dental records, Police 
Sgt. Jim Potts said. Moreover, authorities have yet to pinpoint the cause of 
death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The body was found in the bedroom of Casey's unit at the Heritage Point 
Apartments near the Santa Ana Freeway and Jeffrey Road after the woman's 
co-workers told police she had failed to report for days at either of two jobs 
she held, Potts said. 
</P>
<P>
Police checked the apartment about a week after the woman was reported missing, 
but did not discover a body during that search. 
</P>
<P>
Casey apparently had shared the apartment with one or more teen-agers, and at 
least one person was believed to have been living at the apartment during the 
past week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities would not release further details, saying the case was still 
under investigation.

JOB CENTER A YEAR LATER; 
</P>
<P>
COSTA MESA PLAN TO GET DAYWORKERS OFF STREET LAUDED, ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES STROUSE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each morning around sunrise, Jose Cordoba, a silver-haired gardener from the 
Mexican state of Michoacan, joins about 50 Latino men to wait for day labor 
jobs at the Costa Mesa Job Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I started coming here, I waited for work on the street and made only 
about $30 for 12 hours," said Cordoba, who now lives in Costa Mesa. "Here, if 
they offer less than $5 per hour, I won't take it and neither will anybody 
else, so they have to pay more." 
</P>
<P>
Cordoba is one of several hundred Orange County Latino residents who have taken 
advantage of Costa Mesa's 11-month-old job center, said to be the nation's only 
municipally sponsored hiring hall. Each day, about 50 men show their Social 
Security cards and drivers' licenses -- proof of their legal status in this 
country -- to center staff members. Then they wait for construction foremen, 
gardeners and others to drive by in search of workers. 
</P>
<P>
A half-dozen Southland communities are considering following Costa Mesa's lead, 
and the center has drawn widespread attention. Backers claim that it has 
improved dayworkers' wages and eased the burden for employers who face fines if 
they hire undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Claims 
</P>
<P>
But a growing chorus of critics is charging that the center is a tool to 
isolate undocumented workers who seek jobs from street corners and eventually 
drive them out of the city. By requiring people at the center to show proof of 
their legal status, they argue, the city is violating the civil rights of the 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Though the job center at 1697 Placentia Ave. has marginally improved working 
conditions for legal workers, they say, it has worsened conditions for 
undocumented workers and for those who have applied for citizenship by 
excluding them from seeking work there. 
</P>
<P>
Job centers for day labor in California go back to the turn of the century. 
Longshoremen sponsored the first hiring halls in the state around 1900, and 
other unions followed suit. Public sponsorship of job centers began in San 
Francisco and Los Angeles around 1913 when the areas suffered a 
mini-depression. 
</P>
<P>
"Cities have generally opened these kinds of centers in times of depression," 
said James Gregory, professor of labor history at UC Berkeley. "Most of the 
work has been taken over by states and the federal government, but cities come 
back to it when there is a high unemployment rate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employers' Reluctance 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, though, where the official unemployment rate has settled in 
the full-employment 3% range in recent years, the Costa Mesa day-labor center 
satisfies a different need. Crowds of Latinos stand each morning on street 
corners in Costa Mesa and across the Southland looking for work. They are 
generally non-English speakers who say they cannot find full-time work, either 
because they do not speak English or because employers will not hire Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"I've left applications at eight landscaping companies in the area since I got 
permission to work in May," Jose Cordoba said. "One of the companies even 
looked at my identification card and said, 'No that's not legal,' even though 
it was given to me by the government." 
</P>
<P>
Since passage of the Immigration and Reform Act of 1986, employers have been 
required to check documents of all employees to ensure that they are permitted 
to work. In Orange County, 184,000 people have been granted amnesty since the 
act was passed. But an estimated 150,000 undocumented workers remain, and many 
of them regularly seek work as day laborers, according to a study published by 
the Orange County Commission on Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
Many employers, fearing INS penalties for hiring illegal workers, have been 
discouraged from using any Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"In Orange County, there's discrimination because employers are afraid all 
Latinos are illegal, and I think it has increased since they passed (the 
immigration reform act)," said Leo Chavez, a UC Irvine professor of 
anthropology who specializes in immigration. "Ever since (the immigration 
reform act) was passed, people won't hire Latinos like they used to." 
</P>
<P>
In Costa Mesa, officials considered the issue for at least a year before 
opening the center. Mexican and Central American refugees, both legal and 
illegal, had long crowded Lions Park and several other areas around the city 
each morning, causing neighbors to complain. 
</P>
<P>
"We just thought it was unacceptable to have a hundred people in a city park 
walking up and down the sidewalks, littering and waiting for work," said Costa 
Mesa Mayor Peter F. Buffa. "We really only had one concern when we set up the 
center -- to find work for legal workers." So Costa Mesa approved a plan last 
fall to spend $3,000 to $4,000 a month to rent and staff a rehabilitated gas 
station where workers could wait in comfort and out of the way. Buffa said it 
was decided to allow only documented workers to use the center because the city 
is prohibited by federal law from spending public funds on undocumented 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our idea was to tell people to go to the job center if they had documents . . 
. and if they didn't have them, to apply for amnesty," Buffa said. 
</P>
<P>
The city hired three bilingual aides to coordinate English-speaking employers 
and Spanish-speaking workers, and soon local people donated furniture and food 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Though only a few people showed up the first day, by the end of the job 
center's first month, 879 people had been through the doors and more than 300 
jobs had been delivered. 
</P>
<P>
A few problems were encountered, though. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, we handed out jobs on a first-come, first-served basis," said Costa 
Mesa intergovernmental relations officer Cheryl Friedling, who helped set up 
the center. "Because they were so eager to work, they came earlier and earlier, 
sometimes with sleeping bags so they could be first in line, and we decided 
that was inhumane." 
</P>
<P>
Job center managers started drawing lots for the first job when the center 
opened at 6 a.m., and user numbers grew steadily. During the facility's first 
six months, the number of day laborers who signed up each day grew from about 
25 to as many as 85 in March. Consistently, for the first few months, 40% of 
those who arrived found work. Dozens of workers continued to stand on the 
streets near the center, but their numbers dwindled as the facility was 
increasingly successful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction Employers 
</P>
<P>
About 25 employers, mostly construction companies, also started coming to the 
center each day to pick workers for a day or two of manual labor. 
</P>
<P>
"These people (at the center) are great for demolition and concrete work," said 
Jerry Perez, a residential remodeler, as he hired two workers at the center on 
a recent morning. "I pick them up here, take care of them, buy them lunch, and 
then bring them back in the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Perez said he starts off workers from the center at $6 per hour. Like most 
other center users, Perez said one of the major reasons he uses the center is 
because its three clerks have been trained by the INS to check working papers. 
Others agree. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have to pick up workers at the doughnut shop or the park like 
everyone else," said John Bennett, co-owner of Evans Plumbing Inc., a small 
Costa Mesa firm that now hires two or three workers every couple of weeks. 
"They've already shown somebody their green card and that takes responsibility 
off our back." 
</P>
<P>
Workers are nearly as satisfied with the center as employers, but many say the 
amount of work available through the center is declining. And although work is 
sporadic, most say overall that they are better off than before the center was 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
The city offers no formal wage control to workers, but a center employee 
occasionally asks if any of the workers have had problems collecting their 
wages. If problems crop up, Costa Mesa Police Officer Dennis Jefcoat, who last 
spring received an award from the Orange County Human Relations Commission for 
his work with Latin laborers, is called. 
</P>
<P>
Jefcoat points out that the only problems of non-payment of wages or labor 
theft reported recently in Costa Mesa have come from the group of mostly 
undocumented workers who still gather each morning at Lions Park, not from 
those who frequent the job center. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at the center are being treated better, and those in (Lions Park) 
are getting the message that Costa Mesa isn't a good place to find work," 
Jefcoat said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critics' Lone Complaint 
</P>
<P>
Even critics of the job center, which include the American Civil Liberties 
Union and Catholic and Latino groups, laud its efforts to help the newly 
legalized and non-English-speaking population. They complain only that 
undocumented workers are denied entry and that the city is trying to drive out 
workers in other parts of the city. Checking documents is the responsibility of 
federal rather than city government, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
"Costa Mesa has chosen to discriminate and is denying people the right to 
work," said Father Jaime Soto, vicar for the Hispanic Community of Orange 
County. "If the city is going to address the problem of day laborers, they 
should make a center open to all workers." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Latino groups, the ACLU recently threatened the city with a lawsuit, 
citing both a city ordinance denying funds to groups that serve undocumented 
workers and the practice of denying those workers entrance to the center. 
</P>
<P>
"A hiring hall has to be open to all residents, not just documented workers," 
said Rebecca Jurado, an ACLU attorney. "When a local body takes it upon itself 
to check documents before they give somebody a job, they're being overbroad and 
unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, use of the center has declined. In July, the total who arrived each 
morning dropped to its lowest point since January and the percentage of workers 
hired fell to only 34%, the worst rate since the center opened. 
</P>
<P>
Competition from illegal aliens standing on the street has increased and many 
gardeners are heading there, say workers at the center. That could mean that 
center users will eventually return to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"At the center, it's better than in a factory, but we only work about two days 
a week," said Juan Ruiz, 35, who came to this country three years ago from 
Mexico. "I'm not really thinking about going back to the park to look for work, 
but there is a chance that I might have to eventually." 
</P>
<P>
But authorities on the subject contend that the center will continue to draw 
workers and employers, if for no other reason than the convenience. 
</P>
<P>
"Employers won't leave Costa Mesa to find workers, and as long as there's a 
center some will come there," UCI's Chavez said. "It's an implicit part of 
their agreement that workers come to where the employers are . . . and that 
probably will never change."

UNITED WESTERN MEDICAL CENTER CLOSES ITS 2 OUTPATIENT CARE UNITS IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1985, United Western Medical Center, which operates hospitals in Santa Ana 
and Anaheim, was the first of several out-of-town hospitals to compete for 
patients in Irvine by placing an outpatient facility there. Now it is the first 
hospital to pack up and leave. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend all equipment was moved out of the diagnostic imaging and 
surgi-centers at 4900 Barranca Ave. in Woodbridge. Officials at United Western 
Medical Center, which had owned the surgi-center and had been a general partner 
in the imaging center, said both operations were shut because they were money 
losers. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of efforts to make it (the outpatient facility) work. But you 
can only bleed so long," said Douglas Drumwright, United Western Medical 
Center's president and chief executive officer. He said as a last-ditch effort 
to keep the surgi-center going, the hospital tried without success to syndicate 
the business to physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for closing the facility, Drumwright said, is the impending 
debut of Irvine's first community hospital. Irvine Medical Center, a 177-bed 
hospital, is scheduled to open in January. 
</P>
<P>
Other hospitals that continue to operate outreach medical services in Irvine 
include Hoag Hospital of Newport Beach, St. Joseph Hospital of Orange and 
Kaiser Permanente, a health maintenance organization.

Trimedyne Inc., the Tustin manufacturer of laser-assisted catheters to open 
blocked leg arteries, said it has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration to market a new laser probe. The Laserprobe SLR catheter, 3 
millimeters in diameter, is the 10th and largest probe to be marketed by 
Trimedyne, said Richard Demmer, executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Demmer said the probe was added to the Trimedyne product line "at the request 
of leading surgeons who asked us to develop a wider laser-heated probe to 
vaporize more plaque in the arteries."
