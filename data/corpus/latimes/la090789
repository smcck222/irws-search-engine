GEORGES SIMENON, 86; CREATOR OF INSPECTOR MAIGRET WROTE 500 BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
France mourned one of its most popular and prolific writers Wednesday as the 
body of Georges Simenon, author of more than 500 books, including the immensely 
successful Inspector Maigret detective series, was cremated in a family 
ceremony near his home in Lausanne, Switzerland. Simenon died in his sleep 
Monday night after a long illness. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
The French government television network, Antenne 2, suspended regular 
programing Wednesday night for special broadcasts on the life and work of the 
Belgian-born author. Homage to Simenon, whom the French Nobel laureate Andre 
Gide honored in 1939 as "perhaps the greatest and most genuine novelist of 
today's French literature," poured in from every corner of the French-speaking 
world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Giant' 
</P>
<P>
Actor Jean Richard, one of 22 performers who played Inspector Jules Maigret in 
movies and on television, described Simenon as "a giant who has disappeared." 
In all, 52 films and 211 television episodes were made from Simenon's books. 
</P>
<P>
Even detectives at Paris police headquarters, the Palais de Justice at 36 Quai 
des Orfevres, the setting for most of the Maigret books, said they had been 
inspired by Simenon's work. 
</P>
<P>
"For us here at '36,' " Police Director Jean-Pierre Sanguy said, "Simenon was a 
lesson of classic discipline in his investigations and humanity in his 
contacts." 
</P>
<P>
In Maigret, the pipe-smoking intellectual police commissioner with great, 
almost omniscient, objectivity that allowed him to see even the most brutal 
criminals "without pity or hatred," Simenon created an idealized Frenchman. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Simenon's many biographers contend that the author himself began to 
adopt Maigret's traits as the character evolved, beginning with "The Strange 
Case of Peter the Lett" in 1931, through more than 80 books. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unflattering Biography 
</P>
<P>
One writer commented Wednesday in the newspaper Le Monde, "Simenon gave birth 
to Maigret and then adopted his tastes, his tics, his methods to the point that 
one could ask who is the father of the other." 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Denise Quimet Simenon, the author's second wife, from whom he 
separated in 1969, said in an unflattering biography that he even demanded that 
she imitate the fictional detective's wife, including gaining weight. 
</P>
<P>
Inspector and Madame Maigret were what many consider an ideal petit-bourgeois 
couple. He was absolutely respectful and faithful to his wife. She brought his 
slippers, filled his pipe and always had a hot meal waiting when he arrived 
home late from work. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Simenon was much more complicated than his character. He said in his 
characteristically copious memoirs that he had made love to 10,000 women, 
ostensibly to study female traits for his novels. He described his stormy 
second marriage as an "infernal symphony." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daughter Committed Suicide 
</P>
<P>
The most telling blow in his life came when his beloved 25-year-old daughter, 
Marie-Jo, committed suicide in 1978, shortly after he began a relationship with 
his second wife's chambermaid, a lasting arrangement in which he claimed to 
find "complete harmony." In his will, Simenon stipulated that his ashes be 
spread on the same spot as his daughter's under a 250-year-old cedar tree 
outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Liege, Belgium, on Feb. 13, 1903, Simenon quit school at 16 and worked 
as an apprentice baker before launching his writing career as a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to Paris in 1922 and began producing books under 17 different 
pseudonyms, including comical names such as Monsieur Le Coq, Bobette and La 
Deshabilleuse. An early financial success, he began to enjoy literary 
recognition in the 1920s when the writer Collette spotted his work and 
encouraged him. 
</P>
<P>
He traveled extensively and lived in the United States and Canada before moving 
to Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simple, Direct Style 
</P>
<P>
Simenon had a crisp, clear writing style, a strong sense of the mot juste that 
is admired in French writing and a genius for descriptive writing. His simple, 
direct style helped make him one of the most exported French writers in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
His books have been translated into 55 languages. A United Nations survey in 
1973 estimated that more than 500 million copies of Simenon's books, including 
pirated editions, had sold worldwide. He was especially popular in the Soviet 
Union, where editions of his works sometimes sold 500,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of Simenon's work, in fact, has always detracted from his reputation 
as a writer. He appeared to produce books without effort, bragging once to Gide 
that he could complete an entire novel in three days. During his peak years of 
production, in the 1960s, he wrote an average of six books a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complete Works Planned 
</P>
<P>
His Paris publisher recently decided to publish the complete works of Simenon, 
an effort that will require 32 volumes of 800 pages each before it is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
"Each time I have an idea for a book," Simenon once joked, "I have to ask 
myself if I have already written it." 
</P>
<P>
Simenon's productivity, which may have kept him from winning the Nobel Prize 
that some believed he deserved, was best illustrated in an anecdote attributed 
to Alfred Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to reach Simenon on the telephone, Hitchcock was intercepted by the 
writer's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"Impossible to connect you," she said, "he's just started a book." 
</P>
<P>
"No problem," Hitchcock is said to have replied. "I'll wait on the line until 
he finishes."

DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: TRANSPLANTING ROW HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dirk Sutro 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego has a tradition of borrowing architecture, regardless of how well it 
fits this region. Pirated home designs have been especially popular, such as 
the 19th-Century salt boxes and Victorians lifted from the eastern United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, where there hadn't been new homes for decades before '80s, developers 
and architects have built apartment buildings and single-room-occupancy hotels 
that address the street on a pedestrian scale with interesting architecture. 
But so far, there haven't been any truly urban homes for sale. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '80s, the Park Row and Marina Park condominiums south of Broadway 
gave San Diegans a chance to buy new homes in the heart of the city, but they 
weren't tailored to the location. 
</P>
<P>
Marina Park is a closed-in, low-rise apartment building, with all of its 
luxuries contained within, an approach more suited to suburbia or cities in the 
East, where it is too cold to utilize outdoor spaces. Park Row, with its 
courtyards and airy Mediterranean look (white stucco and tile roofs) was 
better, but also more suburban than urban in the way it turned inward instead 
of out toward the life on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-story Meridian became the first high-rise condo project downtown when it 
opened in 1985, offering up to 3,300 square feet of living area. Here, at 
least, was an urban experience, with many homes having spectacular views of the 
downtown skyline, and with some of life's essentials available in nearby Horton 
Plaza. Still, a high-rise doesn't give residents the same kind of life style 
they can get, for example, in Eastern row houses, with their front stoops 
meeting the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Now along comes Jonathan Segal, 27, a self-assured guy prone to wearing double 
breasted designer suits, touting a new brand of downtown housing. 
</P>
<P>
How self-assured is he? "My goal is to be the leading architect in San Diego, 
then the leading architect in the country," he said matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
Segal has taken the row house and translated it to downtown San Diego, where 
his 7 ON KETTNER townhouses are being built. 
</P>
<P>
In his travels as a member of the downtown Resident Advisory Committee, which 
advises the Centre City Development Corp. on downtown redevelopment, Segal met 
a variety of movers and shakers. When he mentioned to Charles Tyson, developer 
of a downtown high-rise, that his dream was to do a unique residential project 
downtown, Tyson had an idea. His mother-in-law owned a small wedge of land on 
Kettner Boulevard at F Street, next to the railroad tracks. Was Segal 
interested? 
</P>
<P>
He was, even though freight trains (and eventually the San Diego Trolley's 
cars) will thunder past only a few feet from his building's back wall. 
</P>
<P>
Segal solved the sound problem by hiring an acoustical engineer, who specified 
double drywall and acoustical theater windows. But the real breakthroughs are 
in the architecture and planning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unique Plan' 
</P>
<P>
"Jonathan came along with a unique plan," said Paul Desrochers, assistant vice 
president of operations at the CCDC. "When he came in with it, we thought it 
was an excellent way to redevelop that site. The project has an excellent 
relationship to the street. We like the scale. We want to encourage 
smaller-scale development." 
</P>
<P>
The CCDC is contributing $100,000 for sidewalk and landscaping next to Segal's 
project, repayable if the architect's profits top a certain amount. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Segal's building will have an intimate experience with the city. 
Unlike Park Row just across Kettner, which addresses the street with a parking 
garage, 7 ON KETTNER will utilize the row house entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Segal, married with two children, wanted to offer new homes for young families 
like his. 7 ON KETTNER's seven homes, scheduled to hit the market later this 
year, will range in size from 1,275 square feet to 2,400, and in price from 
$259,000 to more than $500,000. The architect and his family will occupy the 
largest of the homes, and Segal will work in a basement office. 
</P>
<P>
A self-described Modernist, Segal has designed a clean, functional stucco 
building, with no extraneous architectural decoration. 
</P>
<P>
Entries will have steel gates for security, but they won't be buried somewhere 
within, as they are at Marina Park. Several of the homes will have second-story 
balconies, giving their owners broad views of the downtown skyline. 
</P>
<P>
Segal is clearly a sensitive manipulator of natural light. High clerestory 
windows will channel morning and late afternoon light into the homes, washing 
interior walls with changing colors. Rooftop skylights will let in additional 
light. 
</P>
<P>
The architect, in the manner common to today's planners and architects, likes 
to talk about the "dialogue" his building will have with the street. A good 
example is the "cat's paws" that will frame each entry, squarish stucco pieces 
that will jut a couple feet onto the sidewalk as a gesture to passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Excellent Eye 
</P>
<P>
Parking is one of downtown's biggest problems. Segal has tucked his 
underground, squeezing in two slots for every home, although he hopes many of 
the residents will walk to jobs downtown. Auto access is from the side of the 
building, leaving the front dedicated to foot traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does Segal design with functional good sense, but, based on his model 
for 7 ON KETTNER, he appears to have an excellent eye for form and proportion. 
Subtle touches give the building sophistication, like the way the curved 
balconies mirror the shapes of the entry landings below them, and the way the 
building's massing and window placement form a well-balanced composition. 
</P>
<P>
Already, he has secured two 10,000-square-foot lots at 2nd Avenue and Market 
Street, where he plans to build his next generation of downtown housing. 
</P>
<P>
Segal is an architect to watch. Even if he doesn't make the pages of GQ, his 
architecture is bound to get attention. The emphasis on problem-solving, not 
flash or gimmicks, is rare in a young architect.

JACK SMITH: SHOWING SOME BACKBONE BY AVOIDING MEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gradually, in response to appeals from save-the-animals groups and in obeisance 
to my own conscience, I am eliminating meat from my diet. That is, I have given 
up scallops, oysters, snails and all the other invertebrates, which I never 
liked anyway. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to be cynical. I am horrified by stories of how young cows are 
raised for veal, and I don't even like to think of what life must be like for 
chickens. In fact, I have given up veal. The problem is, I still eat chicken. 
</P>
<P>
My excuse, of course, is that it is not ordained that we refrain from eating 
meat. Random Chance made us omnivorous. We are at the top of the food chain, 
and we may eat whatever appeals to us, without sin. In the Bible, did they not 
barbecue the fatted calf? Was Jesus not a fisherman? 
</P>
<P>
It is also true that the people who champion animals are more inclined to favor 
vertebrates than non-vertebrates. It is much easier to love a panda than a 
jellyfish. 
</P>
<P>
However, as Sy Montgomery noted on The Times' science page some time ago, 
people are beginning to realize that invertebrates are worthy creatures too. In 
Plainfield, N.H., he pointed out, the people have adopted the Cobblestone Tiger 
Beetle as their town insect, and sales of T-shirts displaying the beetle on 
them pay for the protection of its habitat. 
</P>
<P>
That being the way the wind is blowing, I am happy to receive a letter from 
Mario E. Baur, a professor of chemistry at UCLA, commending me for my recent 
column on the banana slug, a species that, as he points out, "does not usually 
receive favorable publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Introducing me to a new word, he observes that "unfortunately, most humans, 
even those who relate positively to animals, tend to be rather chordocentric 
(from Phylum Chordata, the vertebrates, broadly speaking) and may be willing to 
grant a certain right to exist to a lamb or squirrel while wishing to deny it 
to a termite, mosquito or slug." 
</P>
<P>
As Montgomery pointed out, people used to think that "invertebrates were there 
to swat, spray or step on." 
</P>
<P>
I myself have trouble identifying with flies, ants and back-yard snails. I 
realize that flies are marvelous flying machines, that ants exist in highly 
organized societies and that snails -- frankly, I can't think of anything good 
to say about snails. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely," however, Prof. Baur argues, "all creatures are equal in the eyes of 
Uncle Random. . . . Even spineless individuals have feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Baur recalls that some years ago a certain garden snail in their yard came to 
recognize his wife, and would crawl toward her whenever she put out birdseed. 
This snail (they recognized it by its markings) would not come out to anyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"It continued to appear in this fashion for most of the summer and fall, and 
then, I presume, someone -- perhaps one of the skunks or opossums to whom we 
try to show hospitality -- got him or her. Severe but necessary is the way of 
the food chain." 
</P>
<P>
Baur confesses that he can not bear the sight of live lobsters in holding tanks 
at supermarkets. (I have also seen them in some restaurants, waiting for some 
hungry patron to pick them out.) 
</P>
<P>
"I used to love to eat lobsters," Baur admits, "until one day, while keeping 
one alive until dinner time in my bathtub, I had occasion to watch it and 
realized that it was watching me, with emotions which I could (I hope not 
entirely fancifully) imagine." 
</P>
<P>
I am reminded of the remark made by Dahlia Gomez when her husband, Romulo, 
dropped a live lobster into a pot of boiling water. She turned to me and said, 
"They don't like it, you know." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, Baur no longer eats lobsters or any other wild creatures, though he 
thinks it quite all right to kill and eat domestic animals. "I cheerfully eat 
steak, hamburgers, chicken and yes, Dodger Dogs." 
</P>
<P>
As I say, I'm gradually eliminating certain kinds of animal flesh from my diet, 
but, like Prof. Baur, I tend to rationalize. I may give up steak, but not 
hamburger; I may give up oysters, but not orange roughie; I may give up shrimp, 
but not bacon; I may give up veal but not little pig sausages. 
</P>
<P>
And I'll never give up Dodger Dogs.

DAVID NELSON / SOCIETY: MAZUR ROAST AN EVENING OF S.D. FIRSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the "Women Together" benefit at the San Diego Omni, there was some debate 
among the 350 guests whether the chubby-cheeked toddler whose photo appeared on 
the invitation cover was gurgling "Is this wonderful or what?" or "It's to die 
or!" 
</P>
<P>
Both expressions have been virtually patented by Maggie Mazur, who at the time 
the circa-1930 photograph was taken was known more formally as Margherita Hunt 
of Passaic, N.J. Since then, the civic volunteer, political mover and shaker 
and professional fund-raiser has become known as one of the more tireless 
workers in San Diego public life, a reputation that landed her in more than a 
little hot water at the Omni benefit. 
</P>
<P>
The Aug. 24 event offered an evening of firsts. Catholic Charities, Episcopal 
Community Services and the YWCA joined in an unprecedented coalition to host 
"Women Together" to aid their programs for homeless and battered women, and 
Mazur, who agreed to be "roasted" for the cause, became the first San Diego 
woman to undergo the sometimes grueling treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Mazur was in many ways the ideal candidate for a roast, since she has been 
involved with many organizations, most of which booked tables as a gesture of 
respect. The Old Globe Theatre was well represented, for example; after the 
1978 arson fire that destroyed the theater, Mazur inaugurated her "Dump the 
Plump" program, in which supporters pledged dollar amounts for each pound she 
lost. The Old Globe earned $23,000 from the ploy. 
</P>
<P>
Political pals from both major parties also offered support, and the program 
contained many coy references to Mazur's ejection from the Republican Central 
Committee after she managed the successful City Council campaign waged in 1983 
by Democrat William Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Mazur's husband, Dr. John Mazur, was quick to note the cross-section of the 
community that turned out. 
</P>
<P>
"What's interesting about tonight is the circles that are intersecting here," 
he said. "At least 30 different groups are present, and, while they don't 
necessarily know one another, they all know Maggie. She's excited and very 
pleased, and I'm overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
Maggie Mazur herself seemed overwhelmed. Rather than joining the guests during 
the cocktail reception, she camped in her hotel suite until most of the guests 
had been ushered into the ballroom, then swept through the foyer (dressed not 
shyly in a gold lame skirt and a blouson that blossomed with silver roses) in 
an uncharacteristic fit of nerves. Pausing just long enough to greet a few 
well-wishers before joining her family at the head table, Mazur admitted, "I'm 
not ready for this." 
</P>
<P>
If Mazur professed herself unready to be roasted, various pals announced 
themselves eager to witness the basting. "I came because I hope to hear bad, 
nasty things about Margherita," Janet Gallison said. "That's what a roast is 
for. We're all here to get even, because, at one time or another, Maggie has 
roped every last one of her friends into one or another of her ventures." 
</P>
<P>
The ballroom centerpieces, simple arrangements of fresh fruit and vegetables 
that were to be delivered the following day to agencies that assist the 
homeless, did much to explain Mazur's acceptance of the dubious honor of 
serving as the roast du jour. Sue Young, chairwoman of the event, said proceeds 
will be divided among such groups as the House of Rachel and Julian's Anchorage 
shelters for homeless women, and the YWCA'S battered women's services program. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably clear $25,000 to share among the agencies," said Young, adding, 
"I realize that's a drop in the bucket, but it's a beginning for what I call 
'the invisible among the invisible,' or single homeless women. They're the most 
preyed-upon group in our society. Maggie was brave to accept the challenge of 
being our roastee, but that's what our benefit is all about -- it's women 
helping women." 
</P>
<P>
Young allowed that men, who made up half the attendance, did play a role in the 
evening's success. "Of course, we had to get the men involved, and they 
responded eagerly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mazur's oldest son, Steven Hunt Mazur, shared master of ceremonies duties with 
Judy Miller and kicked off the roast with a cheerful comment on the veracity of 
his mother's famous Christmas letters. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother is a great liar," he said. "I could join a Satanic cult tomorrow, 
and Mom would write her friends that 'Steve got closer to religion this year.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Not all the roasters were unkind, although a few, including City Councilwoman 
Abbe Wolfsheimer, got in their licks.

<P>
"Maggie is the only person I know who ever flunked her manicure," Wolfsheimer 
said. "And who but Maggie would volunteer to hatch the mayor's Soviet eggs?" 
</P>
<P>
The roster of roasters also included Barbara Riley, who was Mazur's classmate 
at Dunbarton College in Washington; legendary Old Globe supporter Delza Martin; 
Dr. John Stevens, who was present at the first turkey dinner Mazur cooked ("To 
this day I don't know what I ate," he said) and Dr. John Mazur, who said he 
came to "toast and boast, but not to roast." 
</P>
<P>
Maggie Mazur responded to the jibes gently enough, and pointed to some of her 
accomplishments by introducing the five of her six children who attended. Her 
final remark carried a barb, however. She said to the audience, "I love you 
all, even Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included Melesse and Bob Traylor, Kay and David Porter, Betty 
Miller, Dolores and John Ford, the Rev. Patricia Backman, Sister Raymonda 
DuVall, Lucia and Doug Smalheer, Elizabeth and Glenn Allison, Dixie and Ken 
Unruh, Lucy Goldman, Paulette Gibson, Jeanne and Art Rivkin, Deborah Szekely, 
Jill and Jack Walsh, Kay and John Upton and Konnie and Stewart Dadmun. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Anita Figueredo, the first woman surgeon to be granted operating privileges 
at a San Diego hospital and a nationally known oncologist, was guest of honor 
at "Aegean Odyssey," given Aug. 22 in the Sheraton Harbor Island's Champagne 
Ballroom as the 13th annual fashion luncheon to be presented by the La Jolla 
League of the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
The event attracted nearly 1,000 guests, an astonishing figure for an indoor 
show (Capriccio presented the fashions) and a neat record for the La Jolla 
League. 
</P>
<P>
We'll come close to doubling what we earned last year," co-chairwoman Dr. Carol 
Summerhays said. "This is partly because we're honoring Dr. Figueredo, and 
partly because so many of us have lost family and friends to cancer. If today 
is a big success, it is because it's a labor of love." The event was expected 
to earn more than $50,000 for cancer research and treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
The committee included co-chairwoman Kara Kobey-Canogullari; Karin Camp, Donna 
Wolosin, Lynn Greenlee, Dorothy Andrews, Karen Kaye, Meredith Montross, 
Alexander Bende, Marcia Maisell, Candy Schumann, Lana Meredith, Marianne 
Minihane, Penny Clarke, Irene Cooper, Lorena Mier and Henrietta Bilhorn.

ART BUCHWALD: THE BUCK DOESN'T STOP FOR SUPER RICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been reported that Michael Milken made more than $180 million last year. 
Michael is now having his problems with the Feds, but he is still flying up 
there in the ozone with the super rich. His name appeared on a list that 
included the highest-paid executives in America. (The lowest was Robert Haas, 
who earned a paltry $25 million in 1988.) 
</P>
<P>
What can somebody do with so much money, except buy Grey Poupon mustard from 
the next Rolls-Royce? At some point the sublime becomes really ridiculous. I 
sought out one of the men on the top-money all-star team. His name was Net 
Gross, and his fortune came from manufacturing suspenders to hold up yuppies' 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
I walked into his office as he was having his shoes shined. He waved me over to 
a chair. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you feel now that everyone knows I hanged you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Why should it? Of course I go first-class now. For example, this shoeshine is 
costing me $50. I could get one on the street for $2, but it wouldn't say 
anything about me." 
</P>
<P>
"Is it really a better shine for $50 than it is for $2?" 
</P>
<P>
"Most multimillionaires think so. The shine wouldn't seem worth much if it came 
cheap." 
</P>
<P>
"But nobody knows whether you've had a $2 shine or a $50 one." 
</P>
<P>
"I know it and that's all that counts. It's the same with this shirt. It cost 
$250. That's what I used to pay for a suit when I started out in this business. 
With a shirt like this I feel as if the lord and Merrill Lynch are watching 
over me." 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the material happiness that money brings, what other good reason is 
there for you to earn so much?" 
</P>
<P>
"It tells me exactly where I rank socially. More importantly, it shows where 
the wealthy stand in relation to me. It's hard for you to understand how 
important it is to me to take in more money than Malcolm Forbes. If I have more 
big bucks, I can ruin his breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
"Then, making a billion dollars is still the best revenge?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, because when your income is in the billions, there are only about 20 guys 
in the world who can really screw you." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have any friends among the billion-dollar class?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes and no. I might gang up with T. Boone Pickens just to get a third guy. 
Then on Friday he might gang up with someone else to get me. That's why having 
money is so satisfying -- you stick it to those who are trying to stick it to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
"What else can you do with your fortune besides sticking it to the other guy?" 
</P>
<P>
"The really rich are the ones who put money into play. We spread it around, 
throw it on the table and toss it up, and make sure that it comes back to us 10 
times more than what we put in." 
</P>
<P>
"You must still be left with a lot that you don't know what to do with." 
</P>
<P>
"That would be true if we didn't have to hire lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you need lawyers?" 
</P>
<P>
"To tell us if it is legal to get a $50 shine."

A COARSENED CARICATURE OF 'LITERATURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, Times Book Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First Light by Peter Ackroyd (Grove. $19.95. 336 pages.) 
</P>
<P>
The effect of Peter Ackroyd's "First Light" is the effect of draping quotation 
marks around some markedly signifying word or phrase. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, "First Light" is not haunting, evocative and ironic. It is 
"haunting, evocative and ironic." It is not, to get down to the tachycardic 
heart of the matter, strongly suggestive of the works of Iris Murdoch. It is 
"strongly suggestive of the works of Iris Murdoch." 
</P>
<P>
It is all self-consciousness and self-reference. Instead of a refined variation 
on Murdoch's world of sophisticated intellectuals moving to primeval rhythms, 
it is a coarsening, a caricature; though lacking in the caricature's virtue of 
letting air out of literary tires. Ackroyd pumps more air in. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch is not caricature-proof, but at her best she performs a striking union 
of civilization and myth. In her intelligent Oxford smiles there is the wink of 
a feral eyetooth. In Ackroyd's novel about the spells released when a group of 
scientists excavate a Neolithic tumulus in the West of England, it is all 
dripping eyeteeth, and Day-glo brocade. In quotes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Fractious Group 
</P>
<P>
Mark Clare is the leader of the fractious party that sets to work on the great 
grave, whose shape is accidentally revealed when a fire burns the brush that 
had concealed it. He is earnest, soulful and hard-working, but his progress is 
continually interrupted by the detonations of those around him. Shovels 
disappear, strange figures are seen flitting here and there, one of the party 
is shoved into a trench and breaks her arm, and the excavators' field-office is 
vandalized. The barrow is set at some major cosmic intersection; the story is a 
continuous ectoplasmic traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
A sky-map, thousands of years old and inscribed on a tomb entrance, shows the 
same pattern of stars that the excavators are working under now. This feeds the 
growing madness of Damien, a local astronomer -- he has long been depressed by 
the seeming lack of coherence in modern astrophysics -- who now becomes 
convinced that the Big Bang has been reversed and that all matter is rushing 
back towards him personally. 
</P>
<P>
Mark's wife Kathleen is crippled and neurasthenic. She is perpetually convinced 
that he is about to be killed, and when he would come home of an evening, 
Ackroyd writes, "Her thin, pale face was suffused with light." Eventually she 
is drawn to an ancient woodland tower and jumps off it, fatally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modern Links 
</P>
<P>
A laconic farmer and his son -- Farmer Mint and Boy Mint -- sneak around, utter 
gnomic phrases and are clearly linked to the odd goings-on. Ackroyd intends 
them as modern-day survivors of the old Neolithic rite that shaped the tomb. 
</P>
<P>
Joey, a retired music-hall performer and his wife, Floey, wander through in 
search of a particular cottage that he, an orphan, has dreamed of as his 
birthplace. He is all quips and turns; she is a steady fount of malapropisms. 
"It's a mute point," she will say, and refers to their quest "as a wild duck 
chase." Before the end, they will be embraced by the Mints as their cousins, 
and Joey will be initiated into legend under a crown of antlers. 
</P>
<P>
Evangeline, described as a high official from the Department of the 
Environment, is a constant chivying and exclamatory presence. She is 
flamboyantly lesbian and feels estranged from her father. Ackroyd makes her not 
simply odd, but so improbably odd that at each of her frequent appearances, 
anything else that may be going on is eclipsed by our feeling that something 
has gone wrong. Not with the cosmos, as the author perhaps intends, but with 
his book. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Something Old' 
</P>
<P>
"Something very ancient has entered me," she announces at her first visit to 
the tumulus. "Something old and precious is inside me now." What are the 
"large, squelchy things?" she asks, coming to a pigsty. "Aren't you gorgeous?" 
she exclaims when she meets Boy Mint. Spying Farmer Mint's livestock, she 
burbles: "And cows too. Do you get many of them in the country?" 
</P>
<P>
Alongside all this, the excavation itself is rather prosaic. Eventually, after 
a number of wrong guesses, Mark comes upon the main burial chamber. The single 
coffin is inscribed "Old Barren One": It is the original Mint, the one his 
descendants have been protecting. To prevent its desecration, Joey, in 
post-antlered solemnity, steals and burns it. 
</P>
<P>
"And suddenly Evangeline knew that her father was standing beside her; smiling 
she turned to him," Ackroyd writes. "She talked to him but he made no sound. 
Mark was with Kathleen again as he knew he always would be. Joey put his arms 
around his parents who had returned to him at last." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Mints, they "did not need to turn around to know that there were 
others with them, too, a whole concourse of people who stood and watched 
silently. But they felt no fear. It was as they had always been told. No one is 
ever dead, and at this moment of communion a deep sigh arose from the earth and 
traveled upward to the stars." 
</P>
<P>
After so many arbitrary and dandyish shifts of tone, of character, of plot, 
this climax is not moving; it is "moving." Ackroyd's book rings deliberately 
untrue; he has written not a novel but a "novel." He makes me feel like a 
"reader." This, however, is not a "criticism"; it is a criticism.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: PURSUING RESEARCH ON A LIMITED BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: There are dozens of genealogical books I would like to see. However, 
buying them all would bankrupt me. What tips do you have for those of us on 
limited budgets? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: As in any hobby, our wish lists are usually larger than our funds. 
Determine which books are available in your area. Comb public and college 
libraries, historical societies, and be sure to ascertain if the book has been 
microfilmed by the LDS (Mormon) Family History Library in Salt Lake City and 
thus is available on loan for about $3. 
</P>
<P>
The American Family Records Assn. Genealogy Circulating Collection is 
accessible -- through your local librarian -- for book requests; fill out an 
ALA Interlibrary Loan Request Form and send to Interlibrary Loan Dept., 
Mid-Continent Public Library, Independence, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
A new catalogue of this expanding collection is available (free) from Martha L. 
Meyers, Genealogy Reference Librarian, Mid-Continent Public Library, 15616 E. 
24 Highway, Independence, Mo. 64050. Many titles are especially popular and you 
may have to wait several months to receive such books -- but the price is 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Donations of new and used genealogical books are gratefully accepted for this 
circulating collection. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a member of the National Genealogical Society and/or New England 
Historic Genealogical Society, you can borrow books via mail at minimum 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I finally located a source for a Harris Genealogy (Connecticut 1640-1878). 
However, it costs $66. This book is only 239 pages. Why does it cost so much? 
</P>
<P>
A: This particular genealogy is a reprint of an 1878 edition, and the 
production costs of reprinting genealogies is expensive because of the limited 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The fewer number of books printed, the higher the individual book price. Unless 
you know this is your line, the best way to determine its value to you is to 
try and find a copy of it -- most likely sources would be the Library of 
Congress, New England Historic Genealogical Society's library and major public 
libraries with extensive genealogical collections, such as New York City, Los 
Angeles, Clayton (Houston) and Family History Library in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am trying to obtain a copy of a local history book about a West Virginia 
county which has been out of print for years. What determines which books are 
reprinted and when? 
</P>
<P>
A: Demand. If the original publisher of the book is still in business, contact 
it regarding plans for re-printing. 
</P>
<P>
If the original publisher no longer exists, contact major genealogical 
publishers and suggest it be reprinted. Clearfield Company, 200 E. Eager St., 
Baltimore, Md. 21202, specializes in discount reprints and remainders in the 
genealogy field. 
</P>
<P>
It buys rights to older books and works with other publishers.

GREEN STREETS;

<P>
ON EMPTY NIGHT ROADS, MEAN MACHINES ROAR ILLEGALLY TO GLORY OR DEFEAT OVER $100 
BETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the days of Elvis, Eisenhower and the Edsel, illegal street racing has 
flourished on deserted roads in the San Fernando Valley. Driving at breakneck 
speeds, dragsters must stay one step ahead of the law and seconds ahead of an 
opponent as they vie to be crowned the new King of the Road. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last couple of years, Valley street racers, in souped-up cars and 
motorcycles, have raised the stakes. No longer do friends and foes oppose each 
other only for the pure enjoyment of it. Money in the hundreds, sometimes 
thousands, is gambled on fast wheels and fearless nerves. Racers, faced with 
investing thousands of dollars in new motors and other expensive auto parts, 
say winning a race must reap more than momentary pride. 
</P>
<P>
"I've put 20 grand into my car in four years," said Steve, 23, who repairs 
radiators and whose most recent motor in his 1969 Chevelle cost $5,000. "I 
don't have a savings account. Half of my check every week goes into my car. Who 
wants to beat up their motor for nothing?" 
</P>
<P>
Racers bet against their competition with cash fronted by spectators who make 
their own -- and frequently larger -- side bets. Betting is usually in the $50 
to $200 range. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diluting Spirit 
</P>
<P>
Some dragsters complain that the new financial risks have diluted the original 
spirit of street racing -- all-out anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
But, considering the crowds who show up every Wednesday and Sunday nights, 
racing in the Valley remains a spirited pastime. Dozens -- about 10 of whom 
race regularly -- gather at fast-food hangouts, usually Arby's in Reseda on 
Wednesdays and Tommy's in Sepulveda on Sundays, to plan the night's races. 
</P>
<P>
Even when police force them to flee one location, the dragsters migrate via 
caravan to the next prearranged meeting place. 
</P>
<P>
On one recent Sunday night, in the span of about half an hour, two police cars 
chased 50 racers from Tommy's to a Winchell's at Chatsworth Street and Zelzah 
Avenue in Granada Hills to the Lumber City parking lot on Sepulveda Boulevard 
in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very obvious when they cluster and make their moves," said Sgt. Dennis 
Zine, supervisor of the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley traffic safety 
team. "We have the air unit and other units in the vicinity to spot their 
moves." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Everyone Vanished 
</P>
<P>
Each time, the officers flashed their lights and asked the crowd to disperse. 
Everyone vanished in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're through for the night," one officer said after chasing the 
racers from the Lumber City lot. 
</P>
<P>
But minutes later, the pack had gathered at Canoga Avenue and Lassen Street in 
Chatsworth, one of their frequent racing sites. They completed one race before 
the police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"They think street racers are a bunch of 16-year-old kids in Mom's cars," said 
Robert, 21. "But they don't realize how organized it can be." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ed, 27, a racer since he was a teen-ager: "Escaping the cops kind of adds 
to it all. It's like we're doing something, and let's see if we can get away 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, Los Angeles Police Department undercover operations have 
resulted in the arrest and prosecution of dozens of street racers, although 
Valley officers in recent years have focused their attention on other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"With the gang activities and the drug problems, those are more of a priority 
than the street racers," said Zine, who added that complaints about racers from 
residents have dropped significantly in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Only So Many Resources' 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that it would require a 25-man task force eight hours of work to 
apprehend the people who race in the Valley on an average evening, and "a 
police department has only so many resources." Street racing is a misdemeanor, 
punishable by a fine, usually about $600, and a possible jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1980, a 50-man Valley police task force arrested 46 people for 
street racing and curfew violations on San Fernando Road in Sylmar. Before 
those arrests, Zine said, there had been eight reported drag-racing-related 
deaths in 18 months. He said recent figures are not available, but the danger 
remains. "Their fun gets people killed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zine said he didn't realize that the dragsters and their supporters bet more 
than a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was just nickel-and-dime stuff," he said. "That's organized 
gambling, and that's illegal. They weren't doing that in the past." 
</P>
<P>
None of today's racers knows when or how the drag-racing tradition began in the 
Valley. They recall an attachment to automobiles in their adolescent years, 
often passed on by parents, and soon discovered the streets as a natural outlet 
for their passion. Bored with the routine of Valley night life, they discovered 
their niche in the social strata. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like one big giant party," Ed said. "You see people and friends of yours 
you don't see anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
The party is divided into three classifications: the hard-core racers, who bet 
hundreds and thousands of dollars; the novices, a younger breed who only put up 
a few dollars and race more for the fun of it, and the "squirrels" who, much to 
the irritation of the serious dragsters, are only spectators. The racers say 
the squirrels inflate the crowd, drawing too much attention from the police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Auto-Related Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Many of the racers -- mostly men in their 20s and 30s -- are auto mechanics or 
work in other car-related fields, perfecting skills they'll exploit in the 
nights ahead. It is easy for them to pick up a minor part that can mean the 
difference between winning and losing. 
</P>
<P>
Racing nights begin shortly before 9 p.m. Slowly, the empty parking lots fill 
up with racers and their friends piled into run-down Chevys, Camaros, El 
Caminos, motorcycles and four-wheel-drive pickups in a spontaneous auto show. 
People roam from car to car, many of the hoods left open for observers to gaze 
at the impressive collection of motors. Racers pull into the lots with their 
engines revving and stereos blasting in a bid for more attention. They get it. 
</P>
<P>
Once the primary participants arrive, the negotiations begin. Racers often 
designate representatives to conduct the bargaining for the duel ahead. A 
typical night features two or three races. 
</P>
<P>
"So much depends on how well you can get the best deal," Steve said. "It's as 
important as how fast your car is." 
</P>
<P>
Racers argue, for hours it seems, to secure any advantage they can. Normally, 
motorcycle racers, whose machines have the potential for quicker acceleration 
than cars, will allow their opponents a small lead, perhaps several car 
lengths. The racer's history is always taken into consideration. A very 
successful dragster will be expected to give lengths to someone with a lesser 
reputation. Not surprisingly, a fair amount of hustling goes on, as racers 
deliberately drive poor races to improve their bargaining position for the 
next, and often more lucrative, battle. 
</P>
<P>
"People have long memories here," said Craig, 22, who races his Suzuki 
motorcycle. "That's why I like to race when not many people are around. This 
way, people don't know how fast the bike is. Word gets around, but a lot of 
people don't believe the word." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50 People Gathered 
</P>
<P>
On one recent Wednesday, Craig had no choice -- about 50 people gathered at 
Glenoaks Boulevard and Peoria Street in Sun Valley to watch him race Steve's 
Chevelle for $50. Situated next to a factory far from any residential areas, 
the Sun Valley site is a favorite because racers have several hundred yards on 
Glenoaks to slow down after crossing the finish line. The track is about a 
quarter of a mile long. 
</P>
<P>
After lengthy negotiations -- "So much of drag-racing is a waiting game," said 
Robert -- Craig finally agreed to give Steve a 17-car-length head start. 
</P>
<P>
Once the terms were set, it was time for both racers to undertake last-minute 
preparations. Steve revved his engine as his friends put Track Brite on his 
tires. Craig did the same. The substance heats the tires, making them adhere 
better to the concrete and take off faster. 
</P>
<P>
Steve then put a $15 bottle of nitrous oxide -- a gas -- into his motor to give 
it added horsepower and speed. Racers call it applying "the juice" or "the 
bottle," and it is a condition that must be agreed to by both parties or else 
it is cheating. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe all the ways you can hide the juice," Robert said. "It is 
very easy, and you can't detect the smell. Everyone tries to cheat. It's all 
about who can cheat the best." 
</P>
<P>
Cheating, Craig's followers told him, was his only hope against Steve. He would 
have to "steal the move." Simply, that means leaving before the flagman 
actually signals for the race to start. Racers steal the move on a regular 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jumped the Signal 
</P>
<P>
Craig jumped the signal, but it didn't matter. He lost by at least five 
lengths. His supporters had lost $30 and patience. "We had a bitchin' move and 
he couldn't take him," said Rodney, 22. "That's what I call an inexperienced 
street racer." 
</P>
<P>
Craig, who works in construction, accepted defeat gracefully. "I should have 
been a lot higher on the RPMs." 
</P>
<P>
Steve didn't gloat. The victory kept him on track for more winnings and his 
dreams of street-racing immortality. "I bought this car when it was all busted 
up, and I've put four motors in it. This car will be a legend. People will be 
talking about it for years." 
</P>
<P>
At midnight, the crowd dispersed. All talk was about Steve. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Steve faced a challenge from Aaron, 26, and his Katana 
motorcycle. Aaron hadn't raced in three years and was only willing to give 
Steve four car lengths and "the go," which means the race begins as soon as 
Steve makes the first move. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do it for a C-note, but four-and-the-go is too close," said Steve, 
who agreed to race for $50, mostly fronted by his friends. "He offered me 
six-and-the-go last week, but I think everyone has got him scared now." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Aaron: "The bike can only go 1080 (10.8 seconds in a quarter of a 
mile) with a pro rider, and I'm no pro rider. My reaction time is poor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plea for Sympathy 
</P>
<P>
The plea for sympathy didn't work, and Aaron finally gave Steve seven lengths 
and "the flash" -- the race starts when the flagman turns on the flashlight. 
Steve saw an opportunity to steal the move. 
</P>
<P>
"Lift the light to your stomach," Steve told the flagman, "so then I'll know 
you're just about to light it." 
</P>
<P>
The flagman, a friend of Steve's, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, Steve took off from the starting line, and the crowd assumed 
that he would win. But Aaron beat him by one car length. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction time is very good," said Aaron, who won $20 from Steve. (The other 
$30 was split among their backers.) "I was just saying that to get the best 
deal I could." 
</P>
<P>
Steve remained undaunted. "I'll have my chances." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the crowd had been entertained. 
</P>
<P>
"It was exciting to me," said Lora, 21. "The speed, the noise, it's all so 
alive. I know a lot of people who have made a lot of money in street racing." 
</P>
<P>
Along with dozens of others, Lora stood well behind the starting line to avoid 
the possibility of being hit by racers. Cars occasionally have veered off the 
street into the curb. 
</P>
<P>
But dragsters say they don't think about the danger. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you start thinking about it, that's when it will mess you up," Robert 
said. "You have to concentrate on winning." 
</P>
<P>
Racers say the danger certainly doesn't justify any police efforts to stop 
them. Furthermore, they contend, the community should sanction a special track 
in the Valley for them to race legally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Drag Strips 
</P>
<P>
The legal drag strips in Palmdale and Bakersfield are too far away, racers say; 
they would have to spend too much money on gas and transporting their 
motorcycles and cars. The legal strips require a helmet and seat belt and 
forbid certain auto parts. Betting occurs there, although not as frequently as 
on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a track here would solve a lot of problems," said Dave, 20. "Police 
wouldn't have to chase us, and this whole thing wouldn't be a general hassle. 
Cars would stop getting impounded by the cops." 
</P>
<P>
Zine said several attempts were made earlier in the decade to locate a suitable 
drag strip, but they were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no location here," Zine said. "You're not going to have a drag strip 
next to a residential area. The land is too valuable here for a drag strip." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, racers will continue each week to assemble at their hangouts. They 
can't imagine ever growing tired of the thrill that only speed generates. 
</P>
<P>
"Life begins at 170," said Joe, 21. "The fastest I've ever gone is 240 m.p.h., 
and after you hit 170, it doesn't seem like you're passing things. It seems 
like things are passing you." 
</P>
<P>
Added Craig: "The cops will certainly never stop us. They might break down a 
place and give people tickets, and it might be slow for a while. But we'll go 
to another place. We'll always find another place." 
</P>
<P>
And with the emergence of money on the street-racing scene, the stakes may 
become too high to ever disappear. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, a veteran racer arrived late at Arby's and was still angry 
about all the money he had spent on repairing his motorcycle. He surveyed the 
night's racers and searched for a victim. 
</P>
<P>
"I need a serious money race tonight," he said. "Not $100 or $200 worth. I mean 
some real serious money."

RESPITE CARE OFFERS PARENTS A BURDEN-FREE OASIS OF TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LUSTIG, Lustig is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Think finding a good baby-sitter can be tough? Consider the dilemma of the 
parent of a child suffering from Down's syndrome, autism or cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
But Joseph M. Palazzola, a customer service representative in the men's 
sportswear industry, will take the job. So will teacher Patricia Morgan and 
Postal Service letter carrier Marva Golden. They'll even come recommended, and 
under the guidelines of the state Department of Developmental Services, it 
won't cost the parent a penny. 
</P>
<P>
Palazzola, Morgan and Golden are three of about 200 full- and part-time 
state-funded "respite care workers" in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and 
Antelope valleys. Depending on the seriousness of the disability, respite care 
services can be authorized to provide from 12 to 36 hours of care per month, 
regardless of the family's ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tremendous Help' 
</P>
<P>
"I could not do without it," said Jean Ginsberg of Arleta, who is allowed 36 
hours of respite care per month for her two retarded daughters, Rachel, 18, and 
Dorothy, 17. "It's a tremendous help, allowing me to have a little time to 
myself. It's also good for them to be with somebody else. They look forward to 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a birth-to-death child-care service if the child is eligible," explained 
Ann Baerwald, director of client services at the North Los Angeles Regional 
Center in Sepulveda. The program also serves children who fall into other 
high-risk categories, including drug babies and premature infants. 
</P>
<P>
Palazzola, 42, a former Vietnam medic, prefers to think of himself as a big 
brother rather than a caretaker. "There's a lot of pleasure in it," Palazzola 
said of working with children and young adults, most on a long-term basis. 
"Seeing a person start a project they haven't done in the past, whether it's 
ordering food for themselves, making change correctly or watching them learn 
how to transfer from one bus to the next and get home again gives you a great 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
He thinks many of his charges don't get out enough, either because both parents 
work or the disabled child may be part of a larger family. "I'll put them in 
the car and we'll take off, maybe go to the park, the beach, take a long walk 
or just sit and talk sports. I try for a one-on-one relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's full-time job as a teacher of developmentally disabled students in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District suits her for respite care work. Averaging 
15 hours a week at night and on weekends, the 40-year-old said she does it 
because "I enjoy working with handicapped children; it's an excellent learning 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Marva Golden, 39, walks a neighborhood in Northridge all day delivering the 
mail. At night and on weekends, the certified nurse's aide works about 12 hours 
a week with small children suffering from Down's syndrome or cerebral palsy. 
"They're special kids," she said, "and they make me really appreciate coming 
home to my healthy 15-year-old son." 
</P>
<P>
The state provides assistance through a network of 21 not-for-profit 
corporations established in 1966. The local regional center is one such 
corporation which, in turn, contracts with various other companies and 
corporations to provide suitable workers. 
</P>
<P>
The regional center gets the majority of its workers through the Job Shop in 
Reseda, a company specializing in in-home care; the Jay Nolan Center, a 
not-for-profit corporation in Canyon Country specializing in dealing with the 
developmentally handicapped, and Accredited Nursing Services in Encino, which 
provides full- and part-time workers who are qualified as nurse's aides. All 
three draw on a large pool of people with a variety of backgrounds but with the 
common interest of helping developmentally disabled children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1964 Study 
</P>
<P>
Respite home child care, said the regional center's Baerwald, is the direct 
result of a 1964 study commissioned by the state that recommended helping 
families by setting up home care services at fixed locations. The regional 
center concept was born two years later. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is to give the parents some respite," said Ellyn Hayes of the 
Jay Nolan Center, who stresses the importance of keeping disabled children at 
home rather than institutionalizing them. 
</P>
<P>
The Jay Nolan Center, which provides about 10,000 in-home care hours a month, 
also has a private sitter program for families who prefer someone they know to 
take care of the disabled child. "It can be a relative as long as it is not 
someone who lives in the same home, or a neighbor, a friend or anyone that the 
family trusts with their child. After filling out the required paper work, they 
are paid through us," Hayes said. (The center, which opened 10 years ago, was 
named after the autistic son of late actor Lloyd Nolan.) 
</P>
<P>
Accredited Nursing Services splits its business between dealing with the 
geriatric population and providing respite care for regional center clients, 
said President Barry Berger. The Job Shop does a variety of temporary and 
permanent placement services in addition to working with various regional 
centers, including elderly care and visitation monitoring in court cases. 
</P>
<P>
"We watch the handicapped, the retarded, the epileptic, the autistic, the 
quadriplegic, the paraplegic, combinations of two and three of these, so the 
parent can get away for a few hours a week and take care of their other 
siblings," explained The Job Shop owner, Newton Fletcher. "There is no 
difference in taking care of a mentally handicapped child. If it's a 
14-year-old with the capacity of a 3-year-old, you take care of a 3-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Care for Anyone 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, who also has a regular baby-sitting service, said his motto is, 
"We'll take care of anybody from birth to death so long as it's legal, ethical 
and moral." 
</P>
<P>
All three firms receive a pre-negotiated fee from the regional center, ranging 
from $7.46 to $8.38 for each hour of respite care work. In turn, the sitter 
receives from $4.50 to $5.50 depending on the firm; the rest goes toward 
operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes warns that some sitters burn out when they realize it can be emotionally 
taxing. "Many people believe it's an easy way to make a little extra money," 
she said. "They soon learn otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Denise Peters, a Los Angeles City Unified School District teacher who works 
part time for Accredited Nursing, agrees, but adds, "The greatest joy is the 
pure, unadulterated love these kids give. The kids make it the best job in the 
world."

Jamaican singer-actress Grace Jones failed to show up Tuesday in Kingston, 
Jamaica, for her trial on cocaine possession charges and a court said it will 
order her arrest if she doesn't appear at the rescheduled trial. Her attorney 
told the Criminal Court magistrate that her "absence was due to contractual 
obligations in Italy which she was unable to break, and should not be taken as 
any form of disrespect for the court." The magistrate issued an arrest warrant 
but immediately suspended it, making it effective Oct. 3 if she fails to show 
up for a new trial on that date. The trial has already been postponed three 
times since it was originally scheduled in June, either because prosecutors 
were not familiar with the case, witnesses were missing or judges failed to 
show up. Jones, 37, returned to the Caribbean island for the last three trial 
dates after flying from Paris, Italy and Spain. Each time she complained of the 
high cost of flying back to Jamaica, only to learn in court that the trial had 
been suspended. Jones was arrested in April while vacationing in Kingston and 
charged with possession of .006 ounces of cocaine that police found in her 
handbag. Police said the street value of the cocaine was less than $18. She was 
freed on $2,500 bail. ALEENE MacMINN

The White House on Wednesday formally sent to the Senate the nomination of 
Portland, Ore., lawyer John E. Frohnmayer to be chairman of the beleaguered 
National Endowment for the Arts. Frohnmayer, whose naming to the top arts 
endowment job by President Bush was disclosed in early July, will be subject to 
confirmation hearings before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, 
chaired by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). A Kennedy spokesman said the hearings 
would be held within the next couple of weeks with a confirmation vote in the 
full Senate scheduled by the end of September. ALEENE MacMINN

The marriage of Sir Rudolf Bing to Carroll Douglass was ordered annulled 
Wednesday by a Manhattan Supreme Court judge after a trial in which Bing's 
court-appointed guardian claimed the former opera impresario suffers from 
Alzheimer's disease and was unaware that he had gotten married. 
</P>
<P>
Bing, 87, who once ruled the Metropolitan Opera with an iron hand, and 
Douglass, 50, were married on Jan. 9, 1987. Bing is presently being cared for 
at a Bronx nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
The court denied support to Lady Bing and any portion of his assets. However 
Lady Bing was granted $25,000 to pay for medical expenses. ALEENE MacMINN

 YOU ASKED ABOUT . . .: FOOD LABELING AND THE MANY NAMES OF SUGAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I recently found out that I am diabetic, so now I read all the 
ingredient labels on foods to see if they contain sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Some names are obvious, like sugar, corn syrup, dextrose, etc. But there are 
more that are harder to figure out. I wondered if you could print a list of the 
various names and forms of sugar that we would find in food. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The following information is excerpted from a scientific status summary 
by the Institute of Food Technologists Expert Panel on Food Safety and 
Nutrition and a fact sheet from the Sugar Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
Any sweetener that provides calories is considered a nutritive sweetener. 
Sugars, syrups, molasses, sugar alcohols and honey are therefore all classified 
as nutritive sweeteners. 
</P>
<P>
All carbohydrates, whether sugar, starch or fiber, must be broken down into 
molecules of simple sugar before they can be utilized in the body. The two most 
common simple sugars are glucose and fructose. 
</P>
<P>
GLUCOSE is also known as dextrose. It is naturally present in many fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
FRUCTOSE, also called levulose or fruit sugar, is the sweetest of all the 
sugars and is generally found in foods such as fruits and honey. 
</P>
<P>
SUCROSE, the common sugar for household and industrial use, is composed of the 
previous two simple sugars, glucose and fructose, chemically bound together. 
Granulated sugar is about 99.9% pure sucrose. 
</P>
<P>
RAW SUGAR is an intermediate product of sucrose production. Raw sugar crystals 
are covered with a film of syrup containing impurities. 
</P>
<P>
TURBINADO SUGAR is raw sugar that has been further refined to remove the 
impurities. 
</P>
<P>
MOLASSES is the dark-colored liquid produced in the refining of sugar. Molasses 
syrup contains 50% to 75% sucrose. Blackstrap molasses is a byproduct of the 
final molasses crystallization step. 
</P>
<P>
BROWN SUGAR consists of sucrose crystals covered with a film of molasses syrup 
that gives the characteristic color and flavor. The sucrose content varies from 
91% to 96%. 
</P>
<P>
POWDERED OR CONFECTIONER'S SUGAR is another form of sucrose made by grinding 
the sugar crystals. It is usually mixed with about 3% starch to prevent 
clumping. 
</P>
<P>
LACTOSE, or milk sugar, is composed of the simple sugars glucose and galactose. 
It is contained in mammalian milk. Compared to sucrose sugar, it is only 
slightly sweet and markedly less soluble in water. 
</P>
<P>
MALTOSE, or malt sugar, is a product of the fermentation of starches by enzymes 
or yeast. Maltose is also formed by yeast during bread making. 
</P>
<P>
HONEY is a natural syrup made from plants by honeybees. It may vary in 
composition and flavor depending on the plant source from which the nectar was 
collected, the amount of processing and the length of storage. The principal 
sugars contained in honey are fructose and glucose. 
</P>
<P>
MAPLE SYRUP is derived from the spring flow of the sap of mature sugar maples. 
It is composed almost entirely of sucrose. 
</P>
<P>
CORN SYRUP is derived from corn starch. It is composed of molecules of 
different glucose chain lengths. It is less sweet than sucrose. 
</P>
<P>
HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP (HFCS) is made by a process that converts glucose, 
derived from corn starch, to fructose. It may be made with a composition of 
from 40% to 100% fructose. Since fructose has a higher perceived sweetness than 
sucrose, HFCS in food products allows a reduction in the quantity of sweetener 
used and allows for a lower-calorie product. 
</P>
<P>
SUGAR ALCOHOLS are sweetener substitutes that, except for xylitol, occur 
naturally in fruits. Sorbitol, mannitol and maltitol are considered less sweet 
than sucrose. Xylitol has the same sweetness as sucrose and is obtained from 
xylan found in wood pulp, chips, nutshells, cane sugar bagasse, straw or 
corncobs.

BANANA SPLIT BARS ARE MOIST AND FLAVORFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a quick, totable dessert that can go from freezer to lunch box and is 
perfect for school or the office, try Banana Split Bars. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of fruits -- ripe bananas baked in a cake-like batter with 
tangy crushed pineapple and some maraschino cherries for extra taste and color 
-- creates a moist, dense texture.

SCHOOL LUNCHES COME UNDER FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
STATE LEGISLATION AIMED AT REDUCING FAT AND CHOLESTEROL CONTENT IN MEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
State legislators have taken aim at the fat and cholesterol content of school 
lunches with a bill designed to reduce the potentially harmful compounds in 
meals served to California students. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation calling for the new dietary guidelines for school food service 
programs last week passed the state Senate by a 32-0 vote. A slightly different 
version was approved earlier by the Assembly. The bills will now be reconciled 
by the Legislature before being sent to Gov. George Deukmejian for 
consideration. If enacted, the measure would be the first of its kind in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-S. San Francisco), 
requires that the state's Department of Education establish maximum intakes of 
compounds such as saturated fat and cholesterol for school lunches. 
</P>
<P>
No more than 30% of the total caloric intake of school-age children should be 
from fat, according to several federal advisory panels such as the National 
Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elevated Cholesterol Levels 
</P>
<P>
The state's new program, which would become effective Jan. 1, was prompted by 
Speier's concern over a recent study that indicated as many as 37% of those 
California fourth-graders tested had elevated blood cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
"In March, during National Nutrition Month, I went to a local grammar school in 
my district to have lunch with the children. And we dined on Tater Tots and 
corn dogs. They're foods loaded with fat and cholesterol," she said. "If we 
want to raise healthy kids to healthy adults, then we need to become more 
aggressive in preparing meals in school that are healthful." 
</P>
<P>
Speier said that recent research indicates that poor eating habits developed by 
children often carry over into adulthood. A lifelong high-fat diet could be 
especially troublesome because it is considered a risk factor for heart 
disease. Elevated cholesterol levels have also been linked to increased 
incidence of atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. 
</P>
<P>
Nutritional deficiencies in the school lunch program are not restricted to 
California. A report issued last week by a Washington-based consumer group was 
highly critical of the nutritional content of meals being served to the 
nation's school children. 
</P>
<P>
Public Voice for Food &amp; Health Policy randomly surveyed, via 
questionnaires, school food service professionals nationwide in order to assess 
attitudes about the fat content of meals served to students. The vast majority 
of those queried, or 80%, said that fat content needs to be reduced in the 
children's meals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Critical Dietary Change' 
</P>
<P>
"We chose this focus because of the strong consensus among health professionals 
that intake of fat is the single most critical dietary change needed by 
individuals two years of age and older," said Ellen Haas, Public Voice 
Executive Director. "In recent months we have seen important documentation of 
this in reports from the surgeon general, the National Academy of Sciences and 
a number of newly reported scientific studies." 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who responded to the Public Voice questionnaires laid the blame 
for the fat problem, in particular, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The agency spends more than $4 billion to subsidize school meals throughout the 
country. More than 24 million children at 91,000 schools receive some form of 
federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, much of this aid comes in the form of surplus agricultural commodities 
such as ground meats, butter, cheese and eggs, each of which is considered high 
in fat or cholesterol. Schools, particularly those in middle- to low-income 
areas, depend on these free commodities in order to operate their feeding 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the products that come to the schools (from USDA) are not of interest 
to the student population," said Speier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Varying School Lunches 
</P>
<P>
A USDA spokesman said the agency has made several efforts to vary the foods 
served in the school lunch program and also lower the fat, salt and sugar 
content of the meals. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, only lean ground beef, with a 22% fat level, can be used in the 
program, said Gene Vincent, a USDA public affairs officer. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has also attempted to incorporate more chicken, turkey and fish into 
the feeding program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA has not set maximum fat levels for the diets of children because there 
is still some scientific dispute over research on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no scientific consensus on appropriate levels of fat in children's 
diets, said Scott Dunn, acting administrator for the USDA's Food and Nutrition 
Service. "Moreover, it is important to remember that no matter what level is 
deemed appropriate, that level must be applied to a person's entire diet, not 
to a single food or a single meal. USDA cannot at this time support setting 
quantitative fat standards or recommended frequency of serving certain foods." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survey Findings 
</P>
<P>
Public Voice, in its 35-page report on the survey, made several recommendations 
to the USDA in order to improve the school lunch program. These include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Have the agency set a maximum level of fat in school lunches at 30% of 
total calories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Educate school food professionals about how to reduce dietary fat in meals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make lower-fat commodities from government surplus programs available to 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increase spending on nutrition education in the classroom. Such funding has 
been reduced or eliminated in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
The group also urged the food industry to work in conjunction with the federal 
government and local school officials to develop nutritious lunch items that 
would be popular with children.

 LET'S EAT OUT: THE PAGODA INN IN NORTHRIDGE: ELEGANT DINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pagoda Inn in Northridge took me by surprise. I hadn't expected to find quite 
so elegant a restaurant in the small Porter Ranch Shopping Center at Tampa 
Avenue and Rinaldi Street. 
</P>
<P>
The subtle mauve and gray decor is accented by tasteful Chinese art and green 
plants. Although above average in size, there are enough soft surfaces to 
absorb sound and keep this a low-key restaurant where it's easy to converse. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five elongated, translucent lanterns, decorated with pink and red roses, 
create an impressive chandelier in the main dining room. A scaled-down version 
illuminates the smaller dining room in the rear, set aside for smoking patrons. 
There is also a small private party room that accommodates eight to 12 people. 
</P>
<P>
The main section of the menu offers plenty of tried-and-true appetizers -- 
chicken salad, egg rolls, paper-wrapped chicken and steamed dumplings. The 
restaurant's version of minced chicken in lettuce leaves is called chicken in 
cage, served for four, with flawless lettuce cups and ample chicken in the 
filling. 
</P>
<P>
Chili oil served on the side lets you control the hotness of the Sichuan won 
ton, but we still found this dish a bit disappointing. The boiled won ton have 
only a minuscule bit of pork and mixed vegetables tucked inside. 
</P>
<P>
I use moo shu pork as one of my barometers when judging a Chinese restaurant -- 
both in the way it's prepared and the skill with which it is served. At Pagoda 
Inn, the vegetables in the filling were nice and crisp and the waiter expertly 
wrapped the mixture in the thin pancakes spread with plum sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The soup, seafood, pork, beef, fowl, vegetables, chow mein and fried rice 
sections of the menu include an ample assortment of common Mandarin and Sichuan 
dishes. All the food is prepared using vegetable oil and attention is paid to 
keeping it low in sodium, fat and sugar. No monosodium glutamate is used. 
</P>
<P>
Where the restaurant really shines, however, is in its specialty selections. 
The crispy beef is lightly battered and served in a sauce spiced with garlic, 
peppers, orange peel and ginger root. It arrived at the table with a 
beautifully sculpted cucumber and carrot garnish. 
</P>
<P>
The sizzling seafood delight lived up to both those adjectives. Shrimp, 
scallops, lobster, abalone and crab meat were combined in a white wine sauce 
with baby corn, bright green snow peas, sweet red pepper, two types of 
mushrooms, broccoli florets, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts. 
</P>
<P>
Other favorite specialties include the ta chien chicken, black pepper sizzling 
beef steak, sweet and pungent shrimp and lemon chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Three dinner combinations are offered for parties of two or more. The Mandarin, 
at $10.95, includes hot and sour or won-ton soup, egg roll, fried won ton, 
fried rice and one entree selection per person from a choice of eight. 
</P>
<P>
At $13.95, the Pagoda dinner features war won-ton soup, egg roll, paper-wrapped 
chicken, fried won ton, fried rice and a similar entree choice. The $16.95 
seafood dinner has shrimp sizzling rice soup, egg roll, fried shrimp, 
paper-wrapped chicken, fried won ton, fried rice and a choice from eight 
seafood selections. 
</P>
<P>
Two luncheon specials are offered from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Both feature soup 
of the day, chicken salad, egg roll, rice, seasonal fruit and one entree 
choice. Ten selections are offered at $4.95, another 10 at $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, tea is served with all meals. Champagne, Chardonnay, White 
Zinfandel, plum wine and Wan Fu are available by the glass. Twenty-two wines 
are offered by the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Although four desserts are listed on the menu, we found the restaurant's 
complimentary fresh orange a very satisfying finale to our meals. The fruit is 
removed, sectioned and replaced in its shell, and served along with fortune 
cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagoda Inn, 19348 Rinaldi St., Northridge, (818) 368-0299. Open Sunday through 
Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Friday and Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 10

SOUTH AFRICAN ECONOMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anthony Hazlitt Heard's optimism about peace in South Africa under the new 
white regime of Frederick W. de Klerk ("The Opportunity Is There -- Will De 
Klerk Grab It?" Op-Ed, Aug. 18) is misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously De Klerk's dilemma is the same that faced former President Pieter 
Botha, in Heard's words, "how to carry the white minority into a practical 
arrangement that will satisfy the black majority." It is a daunting problem, 
given that most South African whites oppose democracy (a word which clearly 
means "one person, one vote", in Heard's phrase, but which white South 
Africans, like Heard, seem to have a difficult time using). Heard is probably 
correct that De Klerk, like Botha, will be pushed by historical events to 
institute reforms. Heard may even be correct that De Klerk will go beyond 
"reforms" to formal democracy. According to Heard, "Whites will find playing a 
role commensurate with their numbers (which are small) and their economic clout 
(which is big) is not that intolerable." Will such an arrangement satisfy the 
black majority? 
</P>
<P>
The assumption that the black majority of South Africa will be satisfied with 
formal democracy and never ask for economic redistribution assumes that blacks 
will forget South Africa's history. What started as outright theft of land soon 
became "legalized" though laws passed by white governments to prevent blacks 
from owning land or working in the most skilled and lucrative of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
I recall being a teen-age intern for former Rep. Charles Diggs. I had asked the 
South African embassy for information and received a very slick and glossy book 
filled with color-coded maps to show where major water sources existed or 
precious minerals were found. One also showed the location of the various 
Bantustans or "homelands" created by the white government for the majority 
black population. I had noticed in looking at the Bantustan map how oddly 
shaped the homelands seemed to be. My confusion lasted only until I reviewed 
the mineral and water maps. Every area of barren, unproductive land in South 
Africa was carved away to create the homelands, leaving whites with all that is 
economically viable. 
</P>
<P>
I doubt that black South Africans will ignore their history. The question of 
economic redistribution will arise.

IT'S PAST TIME FOR A RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congressional Democrats will try again to give the nation's lowest-paid workers 
a raise, their first in nearly nine years. Increasing the federal minimum wage 
beyond the current $3.35-an-hour has proven a difficult task because of strong 
opposition from business interests and a majority of Republicans. Democrats 
have accepted the fact that the only chance of getting an increase in the rate 
is a compromise that President Bush can live with. They are putting one 
together. 
</P>
<P>
The President in June vetoed legislation sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) and Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-L.A.) that would have raised the 
hourly rate to $4.55 over three years. He argued that the increase was 
excessive and inflationary and would cost thousands ofjobs. Bush, who during 
the 1988 campaign promised to raise the minimum wage, indicated he was willing 
to approve a more modest boost, to $4.25 an hour, but only if the legislation 
includeda lower sub-minimum training wage for new workers. 
</P>
<P>
Compromise legislation, introduced by Rep. Austin J. Murphy (D-Pa.), would 
raise the minimum wage to $4.25 as Bush has insisted upon. The increase -- only 
90 cents an hour -- would bespread over two rather than three years. The 
sub-minimum would last for 60 days. At thispoint, it offers the best chance for 
the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
The modest raise would boost a weekly salary based on the federal minimum wage 
from $134 to $170. That's not much, and it won't make up for the losses in 
buying power due to inflation over the years. But a small raise is better than 
none. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 5.4 million Americans earn the minimum wage. Their ranks include 
many teen-agers and new workers, but at least half are older than 25, and many 
are working parents who could bring more money into the house with a welfare 
check. For a parent with two children, welfare and related benefits are worth 
more than a pay check based on the federal minimum wage in 23 states, according 
to Isabel V. Sawhill, an economist at the Urban Institute. Yet thousands of 
poor Americans choose to work for less. They deserve more. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush can encourage Americans who are willing to work. He can help 
working mothers who are trying to help themselves. He can help working fathers 
who are taking responsibility for their families. A compromise on the minimum 
wage is the best hope of achieving those goals.

We suburbanites have tremendous interest but little say on how things go with 
our Los Angeles city government. We suggest it may be time to at least consider 
a city manager form ofgovernment. We have an able but extremely large and 
provincially-concerned council. We havea most commanding and personable mayor 
who makes an impressive greeter and head of state. We very much need a 
100%-honest and dedicated city manager to efficiently act in the best interest 
of our entire population , leaving our mayor free for good-will trips and 
public, ceremonial functions.

103: 'QUICKSAND' OR SOUND LAW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reason for the monumental battle over Proposition 103 is analogous to the 
building of a skyscraper on a bed of quicksand. There is absolutely no basis or 
foundation for a quick solution to a problem that should never have existed in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
When any ruling body passes a piece of legislation, which in this instance was 
making vehicle insurance mandatory, and obligating the entire populace, it must 
also provide the means of the fair and just implementation of that law. By the 
very nature of its identity it must fall into the same category as the gas 
company and the Department of Water and Power, and become a public utility. 
</P>
<P>
How would we educate our children if only private schools vied for our dollars, 
or 64 water and power companies courted our business? Or for that matter, 35 
companies sold us dog and fishing licenses or even Department of Motor Vehicle 
tax tags? 
</P>
<P>
Since vehicle insurance is mandatory and an edict of our government, it is, 
therefore, its long-overdue obligation to provide this service and simplify the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
And from whence the cash to do all this? A previous suggestion of a nickel tax 
on a gallon of gas would adequately cover the insurance needs and fairly charge 
those who drive more to pay more.

DRUGS -- THE REAL NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By selecting the problem of drug abuse as the topic of his first televised 
address to the nation, President Bush has signaled his Administration's 
intention to deal systematically with an issue that clearly ranks first among 
public anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the system proposed by the President -- and, in essence, echoed by the 
Democratic spokesman, Sen. Joseph R. Biden -- is adequate to its purpose now 
should be the subject of a searching national debate. The welcome absence of 
partisanship from both Bush's remarks and the Democrats' response is an 
important first step in that process. 
</P>
<P>
As the Administration's national drug policy director, William J. Bennett, 
indicated Tuesday, the plan he has prepared for Bush essentially represents a 
new managerial approach to a welter of federal narcotics-control efforts whose 
conceptual origins date back to the Nixon presidency. Though spending on these 
programs would be increased to nearly $8 billion, the ratio of disbursement 
would remain what it has been for almost 20 years: Nearly 70% would go to law 
enforcement and the remainder to treatment, education and other forms of 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
Critical thinking about the drug problem ought to begin with the question of 
whether that formula matches what we know of contemporary realities. As the 
President said, a recent study by the National Institute of Drug Abuse found 
that the use of illegal drugs by all Americans has declined by more than a 
third over the past three years. At the same time, the survey reported, nearly 
a million Americans now admit using cocaine once a week or more. That is double 
the previously measured rate and is thought to represent the spread of the 
drug's highly addictive crack variety. 
</P>
<P>
The roughly 9 million Americans who have stopped using illegal chemicals over 
the past few years are mainly people with sufficient education and economic 
incentive to be influenced by society's increasing disapproval of drugs. Most 
also had the private means or insurance coverage that allowed them to undertake 
expensive private treatment, if they required it. Those people whose drug use 
increased during that same period are overwhelmingly drawn from that estimated 
2.5 million poverty-stricken Americans who belong to the permanent underclass, 
most of whose members live in segregated inner-city neighborhoods. It is their 
situation which most people are describing when they speak of "the drug 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The spending priorities advanced by the President indicate he believes that 
these people can be deterred from using drugs by increasing criminal penalties. 
The evidence of the past two decades strongly suggests, however, that people 
living in such deprived conditions do not make rational calculations about 
consequences, as a deterrence-based system presumes they will. This is not to 
say spending on law enforcement should be anything less than is required to 
guarantee people of all social classes physical security. The best way to do 
that is to do as the President recommends and increase federal aid to local 
police forces. Beyond that, it seems to us that federal spending on drug 
control ought to be geared toward providing all Americans with the educational, 
economic and medical advantages which have allowed so many members of the 
middle- and upper-classes to choose to overcome this problem on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it would be helpful if the nation's discussion of this issue were free 
of the misleading martial rhetoric that marred not only Bush's speech, but also 
the Democratic response and most of the commentary on both. The United States 
is not in this instance fighting a war but grappling with an extraordinarily 
difficult social problem created by the intersection of complex social, 
economic and biological forces. The metaphor of warfare obscures these facts 
and leaves us to decide whether those unfortunate enough to be trapped in drug 
addiction are casualties, enemy soldiers or, perhaps, fifth columnists.

Before Congress left for summer vacation, the Democratic majority on the House 
Intelligence Committee was poised to ban CIA involvement in Nicaragua's 
election next February. The committee intended to add the ban to the 
legislation that authorizes funding for the intelligence community starting on 
Oct. 1. But at the eleventh hour, Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
successfully appealed to committee chairman Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los 
Angeles) to delay the vote until after the recess. The Administration, Baker 
said, was eager to avoid a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Now Congress is back, and Baker and his aides will be meeting behind the scenes 
with Beilenson and other intelligence committee Democrats to see whether this 
latest pitfall on the path to bipartisanship can be avoided. It will be a tough 
negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats had enough votes to pass the ban in July, and events in the interim 
have stiffened their resolve. The five Central American presidents, meeting in 
Tela, Honduras, in August, called on outside powers not to interfere covertly 
in the Nicaraguan campaign. Moreover, all 20 opposition parties in Nicaragua -- 
the potential recipients of the CIA's largess -- repudiated covert assistance 
in a landmark agreement on electoral procedures that they signed with the 
Sandinistas that same month. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also must bear the burden of distrust that Ronald Reagan and the late 
William Casey, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, left as their 
legacy. Casey lied to the intelligence committees so frequently and so 
audaciously that skeptical Democrats will want a prohibition on covert action 
written in black and white, and preferably written into the law. 
</P>
<P>
Baker will try to talk them out of that, both to preserve the principle of 
presidential discretion in intelligence matters and to give Bush the 
flexibility to respond to unforeseen circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, however, worry that unless the ban is in the law, there is nothing 
to prevent President Bush from later launching a covert operation targeted at 
the election and paying for it out of the CIA's contingency fund. Although Bush 
would have to sign a presidential "finding" justifying such action and inform 
the intelligence committees "in a timely fashion" (though not, perhaps, before 
the election), the committees have no power to approve or disapprove. Once the 
intelligence bill for next year is completed, Congress will have lost its 
leverage. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Baker's word is far better currency on Capitol Hill than Casey's 
ever was. If Baker gives a solemn promise that the CIA will not try to 
influence Nicaragua's election, many members will be inclined to trust him. The 
Democrats are no more eager than the White House to begin fighting over 
Nicaragua again. Unless Baker is willing to promise at least that much, there 
won't be much ground for compromise. If no agreement is reached, the stage will 
be set for another bruising public debate over Nicaragua, shattering the spirit 
if not the letter of the bipartisan agreement reached in March. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican right is already berating Bush and Baker for selling out the 
Contras because they chose not to fight Congress to the death over military aid 
last winter. As Baker meets with Beilenson, he will have to be watching his 
right flank. To make a prohibition on CIA involvement in the Nicaraguan 
election palatable to the right, Baker will probably want to trade it for a 
sizable increase in overt aid to the Nicaraguan opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has already allocated $3.5 million in overt aid through the National 
Endowment for Democracy. Unlike covert aid, such assistance is legal under 
Nicaragua's election law. But even overt aid can be manipulative if there is 
too much of it. In Nicaragua's moribund economy, a few dollars go a long way. 
On a per-capita basis, the $3.5 million is 12 times more than Washington 
provided the Chilean opposition in last year's plebiscite on the Pinochet 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
Although most Democrats are not opposed in principle to overt aid in foreign 
elections, many would resist sending much more to Nicaragua than has already 
been approved. We do the Nicaraguan opposition no favor by making it appear to 
be bought and paid for by the U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiation between the Administration and the House Intelligence Committee 
will be the first real test of whether President Bush's professed desire for a 
bipartisan policy on Nicaragua is sincere. It will also be a trial run for the 
much more complicated consultations that must occur in November when Contra aid 
comes up for congressional review. For the moment, both Congress and the 
Executive are observing the truce in their war over Nicaragua. We will soon 
know if that truce can be translated into a permanent peace or is merely the 
prelude to new hostilities.

GIVE RESEARCH A PUSH ON REVERSING ADDICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY G. KORENMAN, Stanley G. Korenman, MD, is a professor of medicine and 
associate dean for educational development at UCLA School of Medicine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The war on drugs will not be won in the jungles of Colombia or along the 
borders of the United States. The drug crisis will come under control when 
biomedical research can relieve addicts of their compulsive need for a fix. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in history we possess the tools to understand the behavioral 
neurochemistry of addiction. Spectacular advances in molecular and cellular 
biology have made it possible to conceive of reversing the addictive process by 
restoring the affected brain cells to their pristine state. 
</P>
<P>
Addictions are chronic diseases originating in adolescence and young adulthood. 
Although the decision to experiment with drugs may have been voluntary, what 
occurs thereafter, particularly with crack, is a physiological disorder, not a 
"failure of the will." Susceptibility to addiction is an inherent feature of 
animals and can be demonstrated in every species tested. For example, in 
humans, cocaine activates the brain's intrinsic reward system, initially 
producing an intense sense of pleasure, a high. It also acts as a reinforcer -- 
a form of long-term memory -- that creates a neurobehavioral demand for cocaine 
resulting in "drug-seeking behavior." The reinforcing properties of crack 
(smokable, quickly absorbed cocaine) are so powerful that a single dose may 
create an addiction and long drug-free periods will not extinguish the craving. 
</P>
<P>
To scientists, the problem of addiction is analogous to the quesiton of how 
brain cells undergo long-term modification during learning and how tissues 
differentiate into their final form during development from the embryo. 
Molecular and cellular biologists are producing exciting progress in the 
neurosciences and the regulation of development. While there also have been 
advances in understanding addiction, the full force of contemporary science had 
not been applied to this problem. This is because of the persistence of beliefs 
that substance abuse is a behavioral disorder and that addicts are morally 
suspect and undeserving, and also because of low funding levels. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no national mandate for biological research on addiction, and, 
unfortunately, none is proposed. 
</P>
<P>
With 10 years of a well-funded commitment -- $200 million annually -- we could 
elucidate the detailed mechanisms underlying each of the principal addictions. 
Practical therapeutic results would come even sooner if sufficient funds were 
appropriated to examine promising approaches. 
</P>
<P>
We are not starting from scratch. There are good animal models of addiction to 
study. The reward center has been identified in many species, as have many of 
the neurotransmitters and nerve pathways involved in addictive behavior. 
Chemical tools that mimic or inhibit various effects of neurotransmitters and 
addicting agents are available for experimentation. Research results on one 
substance of abuse may apply to others because of similarities of central 
nervous system responses among them. 
</P>
<P>
Three groups of researchers have proposed promising candidates for inhibitors 
of drug-seeking behavior, including the anti-epileptic carbamazepine, the 
tranquilizer desipramine and the angalgesic buprenorphine. Others will follow. 
</P>
<P>
New therapies require expensive clinical trials to validate their safety and 
efficacy. Large groups of patients eager to break their habit would be willing 
to participate, but pharmaceutical companies will not undertake clinical trials 
unless they foresee a large market for the developed product. Thus, a 
government commitment to pay for therapy would unleash a massive commercial 
development effort. 
</P>
<P>
What must be done? Substantial new government funds should be appropriated for 
fundamental research on addiction, and outstanding scientists must be induced 
to participate in this effort. Additional applied reserach funds should be 
appropriated to permit large-scale clinical trials of promising 
addiction-reversing agents. 
</P>
<P>
There is a great need for a private, nonprofit foundation for the biological 
study of addiction, to engage public interest and enthusiasm, supplement 
government funding, provide educational materials and lobby Congress for 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Addiction reversal offers perhaps the best and most cost-effective approach to 
the epidemic of substance abuse. If successful, the hooked would regain the 
opportunity to live a fruitful life, and substance-abuse therapy would enter 
the medical mainstream and be widely available. As the market of substance 
abusers declined, so would the profitability of trading in drugs. Ultimately, 
society would be spared the vast expenditures for interdiction, law enforcement 
and health care. 
</P>
<P>
In responding to the epidemic of crack we should lead from our strengths rather 
than those of the cocaine cartels. The laboratory must be a principal 
battleground for a successful war on drugs.

<P>
The game that should have ended 1988 will begin 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Morse meets Rancho Buena Vista Saturday at Vista High School, and although the 
game will be more post-facto than post-season, it will still offer a look at 
the county's top-ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista went 13-0 last season, cruising to the San Diego Section 2-A 
title in the school's second year of existence. Morse, ranked No. 2 most of the 
season, dropped to No. 3 after losing, 17-14, to Mira Mesa in the last game of 
the regular season. But the Tigers came back to defeat previously undefeated 
Orange Glen in the 3-A title game and finished 11-2. 
</P>
<P>
Since there is no Super Bowl for section high school football, Saturday's game 
will have to do, and it should do just fine. Rancho Buena Vista enters the 
season No. 1 and Morse No. 2 in The Times' poll. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista has won 14 consecutive games, which ties the Longhorns for 
sixth with Castle Park on the all-time section list. RBV has 12 returning 
starters including running back O.J. Hall, who gained 1,278 yards as the No. 2 
running back in '88. 
</P>
<P>
While the Longhorns have not been around long enough to build a tradition, 
Morse has. The Tigers have reached the playoffs nine of the past 15 years and 
made it to the title game the past two. Morse returns a solid group of players 
who started as juniors last season, including running back Jesse Campbell 
(1,044 yards). 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game may not be the last time the teams meet. Rancho Buena Vista has 
moved from the 2-A Avocado League to the 3-A Palomar League, which means they 
could play again in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But the race to finish No. 1 is not confined to RBV and Morse. Several teams 
have the quality and depth to challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln, the top-ranked 2-A team, will again be tough. Point Loma, which won 
the 3-A title in 1987, could win the Eastern League title over Morse. 
</P>
<P>
Contenders and pretenders should be separated on the field. RBV plays Morse and 
Point Loma. Point Loma and Morse play each other and Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
And lest any team become too confident, there is the following to take into 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Before last season, Coach Dick Haines of perennial power Vista said, "We think 
we've got a shot, if I don't foul them up, of really challenging as the top 
team in the state." 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers opened the season ranked No. 5, which is how many games it took 
them to score on its way to an 0-11 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' 1989 San Diego Section top 10: 
</P>
<P>
1 RANCHO BUENA VISTA 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 13-0 
</P>
<P>
League: Palomar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Craig Bell 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista returns 12 starters and its kicker from last year's unbeaten 
team. Behind O.J. Hall will be Markeith Ross, who ran for 800 yards as the No. 
3 back last season. But will RBV be as dominant playing 3-A Palomar League 
teams week in and week out? Bell figures to find out with his preleague 
schedule. "We though if we're going to move to 3-A, we might as well find out 
what it was all about," Bell said. "The Morse and Point Loma (Sept. 22) games 
will let us know. We'd like to win all the games, but if we don't, we'll learn 
enough to be competitive in the Palomar League." 
</P>
<P>
2 MORSE 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 11-2 
</P>
<P>
League: City Eastern 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John Shacklett 
</P>
<P>
Morse has the players to repeat as 3-A champions and should rely heavily on its 
passing attack, led by quarterback Teddy Lawrence, a senior who started last 
season at wide receiver and defensive back. Lawrence's speed affords Morse the 
option to mix in some runs with the passing game. 
</P>
<P>
3 LINCOLN 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 9-2 
</P>
<P>
League: City Central 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Vic Player 
</P>
<P>
Speed has been a hallmark of the Lincoln football program for years, and it 
won't change this season, when the Hornets' 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams 
will be on the field. A key for the Hornets will be how well junior Mike Temple 
adjusts to quarterback, but that is one of only a few positions where Player 
does not bring back a starter; the Hornets have 22 returning from the team that 
lost to San Pasqual in the 2-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
4 POINT LOMA 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 6-7 
</P>
<P>
League: City Eastern 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bennie Edens 
</P>
<P>
As good as Morse's passing may be, Point Loma's figures to be better. Danny 
White, a big drop-back passer, has two experienced receivers, Brett Callan and 
J.J. Stokes. Callan started last season, catching more than 50 passes. Point 
Loma's inexperienced tailbacks make the running game a question. 
</P>
<P>
5 HELIX 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 8-2-1 
</P>
<P>
League: Grossmont 3-A 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jim Arnaiz 
</P>
<P>
Arnaiz is entering his 17th season at Helix, and the Highlanders have made the 
playoffs 11 times, all in the past 12 years. They have not had a losing season 
since 1975. Quarterback Rob Ippolito will be the key. He was supposed to start 
last season as a junior but contracted mono, and by the time he was ready to 
play, he had lost his starting job to Tory Winrow. Arnaiz and the rest of the 
league coaches have said Ippolito is now ready and should be the league's 
dominant player. 
</P>
<P>
6 EL CAMINO 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 8-3-1 
</P>
<P>
League: Avocado 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Herb Meyer 
</P>
<P>
El Camino and Oceanside used to dominate this league, but San Marcos and San 
Pasqual were the teams in 1987, and Rancho Buena Vista cast its huge shadow 
last season. The Wildcats and Pirates should be back on top in '89. Defense 
will be the strength for El Camino with six starters and three all-league 
players returning. But the offense, with two new running backs, will have to 
come around in time for league play. 
</P>
<P>
7 USDHS 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 8-4 
</P>
<P>
League: City Western 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Ron Hamamoto 
</P>
<P>
Hamamoto has been building a solid program behind the Delaware wing T. Last 
year, the Dons came within four points of one of the biggest upsets in section 
history when they lost, 40-36, to Rancho Buena Vista in the 2-A semifinals. 
USDHS will have a strong defense led by linebacker Matt Miller, but Hamamoto 
must find a quarterback. Jeff Desjardins will move to quarterback from 
defensive back, where he intercepted six passes last year. 
</P>
<P>
8 CHULA VISTA 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 8-4 
</P>
<P>
League: Metro 
</P>
<P>
Coach: George Ohnesorgen 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista began last season 0-3, then romped through league play 7-0. The 
Spartans had the distinction of being defeated twice by 3-A champ Morse, the 
second time, 27-6, in the 3-A semifinals. Quarterback Derek Chapman is back to 
guide the talented offense, as is linebacker Bubba Phillips for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
9 OCEANSIDE 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 9-4 
</P>
<P>
League: Avocado 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John Carroll 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside will be big, but whether bigger is better will probably be decided 
when the Pirates meet El Camino. Sale Asaia (6-7, 270) is just the start of 
offensive and defensive lines that could rival as the best in the county. With 
ability up front, Oceanside should be an offensive power, even without 
quarterback Jerry Garrett, who is again academically ineligible. Carroll takes 
over the team after having been defensive coordinator at Anaheim Servite. 
</P>
<P>
10 MT. MIGUEL 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 7-4 
</P>
<P>
League: Grossmont 3-A 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Gary Cooper 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Miguel was supposed to have a rebuilding year last season after winning two 
consecutive 3-A league titles. With 14 sophomores starting, the Matadors were 
7-3 and lost in the first round of the playoffs. Those sophomores are now 
juniors, and Mt. Miguel should challenge Helix for the championship. Cooper has 
three strong backs, and one will have to come forward to replace Eugene 
Ethridge, who was fifth in the county in rushing with 1,363 yards and 13 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Could break into the ranks: Crawford (7-3) is the only team in the Central 
League that has a hope of staying with Lincoln. Vernon Shaver (10.9 in the 100 
meters) will be hard to catch at wide receiver. Grossmont (5-5, two forfeits) 
lost out on the playoffs because of an ineligible player. The Foothillers have 
enough quality returners who have something to prove about last season. Mira 
Mesa (8-3) could be a surprise with a strong defense and Don Elder, probably 
the league's fastest running back. Elder's success will depend heavily on how 
quickly Mira Mesa's young offensive line matures. San Dieguito (8-3) has always 
played hard nose defense and will be solid again. Southwest (8-4) has several 
key returners on a defense that ranked No. 1 in the county last season.

BRUHO KEEPS HIS HEAD, WINS EL CAJON STAKES

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The popular rap on Bruho, trainer Julio Canani's 3-year old gelding, was that 
he was a bit of a flake. Canani characterized Bruho's record a bit differently, 
saying "he's been an unlucky horse." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, Bruho turned over a new leaf Wednesday at the Del Mar Thoroughbred 
Club, winning the $81,375 El Cajon Stakes by a half-length over Mr. Bolg in 
1:40 1/5 for 1 1/16 miles, just a fifth off the track record. 
</P>
<P>
Known for his slow starts and bizarre reactions to crowd noise and the whip, 
Bruho was for the most part a different horse. 
</P>
<P>
For a short time, it appeared Bruho was up to his old tricks with a slow start. 
But by the three-quarter pole, he had moved into second and began to hint that 
this race would be different. 
</P>
<P>
At the far turn, Bruho passed Mr. Bolg on the inside. He then responded to the 
challenges of Mr. Bolg and Lode in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Davis, who rode to his sixth stakes victory of the meet (one more than 
Eddie Delahoussaye), said he was aware of the gelding's sketchy past. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he had a history of doing some crazy things, and I was thinking of that 
going to the gate," Davis said. "They took the blinkers off, and he was 
listening to the crowd. I wanted to hit him in the stretch, but I'm sure he 
would have (abruptly veered off course)." 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what Bruho did in last year's Balboa Stakes, when he threw Gary 
Stevens just as he was taking the lead in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago in the Aug. 11 Real Good Deal Stakes, Bruho ran a fine race but was 
an unlucky third in a photo-finish, which Mr. Bolg won. 
</P>
<P>
Canani, who claimed Bruho for $50,000 for owner Joseph Scardino, said he will 
most likely enter him in the $1 million Louisiana Super Derby on Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Scardino enjoyed going there last year with Silver Circus, and we may go 
again with this horse," said Canani, who won his first stakes race of the 
meeting. "I'd say it's 50-50." 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron, who rode Mr. Bolg, said his horse "just got outrun." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a sprinter, but he relaxed very well," McCarron said. "He just couldn't 
keep up the last sixteenth." 
</P>
<P>
Bruho paid $11, $5.40 and $3.60, Mr. Bolg $6.60 and $4.80 and Splurger $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rictorius' victory in the seventh race gave trainer Charlie Whittingham four in 
a row dating back to Monday and 13 for the meeting, tying him with Ron McAnally 
for first in the trainer standings. . . . Jockey Gary Stevens' victory in the 
second aboard The Burn Card gave him 41 and a tie for first in the standings 
with Eddie Delahoussaye, who has served two days of his five-day suspension. . 
. . Jim Buckalew, a journalism professor at San Diego State, held half a 
winning ticket on the pick six, which returned $61,473. Buckalew has now won 
three pick sixes overall, including two at Del Mar. The winnings made up for 
Buckalew's disappointment earlier in the day when his horse, Reason To Study, 
was scratched in the first race because of a cough. . . . When Golden Eagle 
Farm's Individualist captured a $27,000 2-year-old maiden race Sunday, it 
continued a big meet for owners John and Betty Mabee, who have now been to the 
winner's circle seven times. The Mabees previously had won twice with Fiesta 
del Sol and once each with Bel Darling, Fantastic Hope, Great Event and Young 
Flyer. . . . Kentucky Derby winner Sunday Silence worked a mile in 1:39 4/5 
Monday morning at Del Mar as he continued preparations for the Super Derby at 
Louisiana Downs Sept. 24. . . . Japanese jockey Yutaka Take, who rode at 
Arlington over the the weekend, made his Del Mar debut with a fourth-place 
finish aboard Wicked Idea in the third race. Take will be at Del Mar through 
Friday. Just 20, he is traveling with a large entourage of Japanese media.

It's hard to imagine that the Raiders' game plan could revolve around whether 
the Chargers start rookie Courtney Hall or veteran Don Macek at center Sunday 
at the Coliseum in the season opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
But just in case, the Chargers aren't saying publicly whether it will be Hall 
or Macek. Loose lips sink ships. Or some such nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I practiced today, I probably won't be starting," Hall said Wednesday. 
"I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Hall and Macek alternated in practice with the first team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's kind of neat," Macek said of the mystery surrounding a position 
that usually goes unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
Mum's the word, too, on whether Joe Phillips will play against the Raiders. 
Phillips, who ended a summer-long holdout by signing Tuesday, practiced for the 
first time Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Raiders) are the ones that have to figure that out," said Gunther 
Cunningham, the defensive line coach. "I'm not telling." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said Coach Dan Henning will make the final decision on Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Free safety Vencie Glenn hopes there isn't a jinx associated with the Chargers' 
annual calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Each month of the year features an action photo of a different Charger. In 
August, that player was Lionel James, cut before the month ended. This month, 
the featured player is unsigned free agent Gary Anderson, who several days ago 
asked to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
Guess who Mr. October is? 
</P>
<P>
"I ain't got no control over that," Glenn said. "But I hope nothing bad happens 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have signed four players, all waived by them Monday, to their 
developmental squad: safety Michael Brooks, linebacker Ricky Andrews, offensive 
lineman Eric Floyd and H-back Craig Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Players on the developmental squad earn $1,000 a week and the right to practice 
with the team. The NFL allows teams to keep up to six players on it. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said the Chargers would like one of those six to be a quarterback, but 
that quarterback won't be Jeff Graham, because Graham has signed with 
Cleveland. Graham, cut by the Redskins, would have been ideal for the Chargers 
because he was trained in the Washington offensive system that is similar to 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The injury report for Sunday's Raiders-Chargers game at the Coliseum: Chargers 
-- tackle Joey Howard (leg) and running back Tim Spencer (neck), questionable; 
strong safety Martin Bayless (ankle), linebacker Joe Campbell (knee), 
linebacker Jim Collins (hamstring), tight end Arthur Cox (ankle), free safety 
Vencie Glenn (calf), wide receiver Jamie Holland (hand), guard David Richards 
(arm), guard Broderick Thompson leg) and linebacker Ken Woodard (knee), all 
probable. 
</P>
<P>
Raiders -- Safety Russell Carter (shoulder) and wide receiver Sam Graddy (leg), 
out; cornerback Dennis Price (knee), linebacker Jerry Robinson (groin) and 
guard Newt Harrell (neck), questionable; defensive end Scott Davis (knee), 
running back Derrick Gainer (knee) and defensive end Howie Long (ankle), 
probable.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: QUATTRO'S NEW PROGRAM DELIVERS

<P>
Borland International on Wednesday unveiled Quattro Pro, the successor to 
Quattro, its 2-year-old spreadsheet program. I've tested a preliminary version 
of the program and I'm impressed -- very impressed. 
</P>
<P>
Spreadsheet programs are used to perform calculations on numbers that are 
organized into rows and columns. When you revise a figure or modify a formula, 
all numbers affected by the change are revised as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Borland announcement comes on the heels of Lotus Development Corp.'s 
release of two new versions of Lotus 1-2-3, the program that dominates the IBM 
PC spreadsheet market with a share of more than 70%. Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.2, 
which is a modest upgrade to the previous version, runs on just about any IBM 
compatible machine. 
</P>
<P>
Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 is an entirely new program with lots of bells and 
whistles. However, it will not run on older computers, such as an IBM XT; it 
requires a machine with the faster Intel 80286 (or 80386) central processing 
unit and at least a megabyte of memory. Millions of IBM compatible machines do 
not meet these specifications. Quattro works on virtually any IBM-compatible PC 
equipped with a hard disk and at least 512K of memory. Microsoft Excel, another 
leading spreadsheet program, like Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3, requires a computer 
with the faster Intel processing unit or a Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
Quattro is not a program that sacrifices one feature for another. It's easy to 
use, heavy on features and doesn't require a lot of memory or a 
state-of-the-art computer. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, it is compatible with Lotus 1-2-3. That's important if Borland 
expects to win defectors from the Lotus camp. The program is also able to load 
files from any version of Lotus 1-2-3 except Release 3. You can also display 
Lotus 1-2-3 graphs and you can use Lotus 1-2-3 macros. A macro is a sequence of 
instructions that enables a user to perform a complicated task in as little as 
one keystroke. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easy to Copy Formulas 
</P>
<P>
It's possible to configure Quattro so that it uses the same menus and commands 
as Lotus 1-2-3, but the program also comes with its own set of menus that, at 
least for me, made it easier to use. Unlike Lotus 1-2-3, Quattro allows you to 
use a mouse to select menus, issue commands and highlight portions of your 
data. I was able to use the program productively after only a few minutes of 
practice; even less experienced users should have little trouble learning it. 
The use of the mouse, combined with the program's superb graphics, made me feel 
almost as if I were using a Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
The program is able to work with up to 32 spreadsheets at a time. An individual 
spreadsheet can take up the whole screen or can be reduced in size to fit in a 
window. The program can automatically arrange the windows on the screen so that 
it's easy to use the mouse or the keyboard to move among them. 
</P>
<P>
A formula in one spreadsheet can refer to data or formulas in another. That 
could be handy if you were consolidating data from several spreadsheets. For 
example, if you were developing a national budget based on reports from four 
regions of the country, you could load each report into the computer's memory 
and quickly consolidate the data. 
</P>
<P>
Quattro also makes it easy to copy formulas or data from one work sheet to 
another. Each spreadsheet is saved as a separate file. But several files can be 
identified as belonging to a group so that they all can be loaded into memory 
with a single command. 
</P>
<P>
All the major spreadsheet programs allow you to create business graphics, but 
Quattro takes it several steps farther. Creating a graph is easier than it is 
with Lotus 1-2-3. As with Excel, you begin by using your mouse or arrow keys to 
highlight the data you want included. You then select the type of graph 
(choices include bar, pie, column, stacked bar and others). If your data is set 
up in a standard column format, you can get an immediate graph by selecting the 
"fast graph" option. But you can also customize the graph. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Create a Slide Show 
</P>
<P>
The most impressive feature, called "annotate," provides you with a set of 
drawing tools that let you draw lines, arrows, circles, boxes and other shapes. 
You can also enter text and modify the graphs. Graphs can be placed anywhere on 
the screen or on the page when printed out. It's also possible to use the 
graphic feature to create a slide show to use during a presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Quattro comes with fonts from Bitstream, which, along with the graphics, give 
it the ability to create impressive screen displays and printouts. Because it 
operates in graphics mode, all fonts can be displayed on the screen or 
generated on a dot matrix or laser printer. I used the program with an 
inexpensive Epson compatible dot matrix printer and was impressed with the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the program was very fast on my 386 machine, which is 
equipped with three megabytes of memory. But it also works on IBM XT compatible 
machines with as little as 512K of memory. To test the program, I deliberately 
disabled most of my computer's memory so that only 435K was available. The 
program worked well, even after I had loaded in 11 spreadsheets. It wasn't as 
fast as it was in the larger system, but it did work. 
</P>
<P>
The ability to run in machines with relatively little memory is increasingly 
important. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Versatile Program 
</P>
<P>
Most IBM compatibles have no more than 640K of memory and a lot of machines are 
now connected to local area networks that require running special software that 
uses part of that 640K. That's not a problem if you're running small, simple 
programs that don't take up much memory. But Quattro is a full-feature program. 
Programs with help screens, graphics, windows and other features generally take 
up a great deal of memory. 
</P>
<P>
Quattro uses a programming technique, called VROOMM, which breaks the program 
into hundreds of small modules, called objects. An object is typically two 
kilobytes to four kilobytes in size. The program has a control center always in 
memory that keeps track of what the user is doing and loads in modules as 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the entire program doesn't have to reside in the memory. This 
creates more room for data, which is why it was possible for me to load 
multiple spreadsheets in only 435K of memory. Because it must load coding from 
a disk, there is a slight delay, but it is minor compared to the advantage of 
being able to use large spreadsheets on the old or low-cost PCs. 
</P>
<P>
Quattro Pro, which will cost $495, is expected to be available some time before 
the end of this year. It requires an IBM PC compatible computer with a hard 
disk and at least 512K of memory. 
</P>
<P>
QUATTRO PRO 
</P>
<P>
Features: Quattro Pro is a full-feature spreadsheet program that offers a wide 
variety of mathematical and financial functions along with graphics and 
database management. It is able to display up to 32 files at a time and has a 
unique memory management system that allows the user to work with large amounts 
of data on machines with as little as 512K of memory. It is able to use files 
created with Lotus 1-2-3.

A NEW LINE ON HOME BUYING; 
</P>
<P>
PROFESSIONAL PLACE HOLDERS EMERGE AS PART OF A SELLERS' MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ira Abrams, a San Marcos veterinarian, was house hunting. So, when he saw a 
sign on Alga Road just north of La Costa in Carlsbad announcing the opening of 
a new housing development called Alga Hills, Abrams decided to go for it. 
</P>
<P>
But he was not alone. More than 1,800 people inquired about Alga Hills, and 
nearly 3,000 people attended the preview in mid-August, a week before the first 
25 homes were put up for sale by developer Fieldstone. The day of the preview, 
180 people talked to Alga Hills sales manager Stacy Foster about the 25 homes 
going up for sale the following week. 
</P>
<P>
But those people were already too late. With the homes selling for prices 
starting at $245,000 on a first-come, first-serve basis, the line to buy had 
formed the day before the preview began. By the time the models officially 
opened for viewing, more than 30 people were camped out. They had stayed at the 
construction site around the clock until the homes went on sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Camping Out for a Fee 
</P>
<P>
Although Ira Abrams did not personally camp out, he was able to buy a home. 
How? Before the preview, Abrams had hired a man named Charley Osterhold to hold 
his place in line for a fee. Osterhold is an example of the small but growing 
cottage industry of subdivision line holders and also a symptom of the drastic 
supply-demand imbalance in San Diego housing. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 32 people at the eight-night camp-out at Alga Hills, for example, 28 
were professional line holders. Each was paid as much as $60 a day by 
prospective home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Alga Hills was hardly the first development in which people have camped out for 
the right to buy a home. "We have had a camp-out for almost every project for 
that past seven or eight years," said Mike Stewart, Fieldstone's Alga Hills 
project manager. Several other builders, including McMillin Communities and 
Baldwin Cos., have reported camp-outs as well. 
</P>
<P>
But the nature of the camp-outs has changed. Once, prospective home owners 
themselves camped out, often building a sense of neighborhood in the process, 
said Foster, who has camped twice for her own homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tightening Housing Market 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Linda Parsons, senior vice president of McMillin Realty, the 
sales and marketing arm of McMillin Communities, the market got so heated that 
the camp-outs got longer and longer. It got to the point that typical home 
buyers with jobs couldn't afford to spend a week off work camping out 
themselves, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
Into the breach stepped professional house sitters, many of them retirees, who 
figured they could provide a needed service at a reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of professional line holding is a direct result of a tightening 
new housing market and rising prices, said Eleanor Madsen, research director 
for Home Builders Research, a local market research group. In July, the number 
of active housing subdivisions in San Diego county had dropped to 147, from 253 
a year earlier. The number of new-home sales dipped to 837, contrasted with 
1,114 in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers reflect a reduced inventory," Madsen said. "You have a lot of 
qualified buyers desperately looking for a new home." 
</P>
<P>
The economics of hiring a line sitter often makes sense, considering that in 
May the median price for a new single-family detached home in the county was 
$227,990, according to the San Diego Building Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are looking at paying $300,000 for a house, $60 a day to hold a place 
in line does not seem unreasonable," said a line holder who identified himself 
only as "Junior," a 68-year-old retired contractor who lives full time in his 
recreational vehicle, staying at state parks when he is not on a job. Junior 
said his camp-outs typically last one to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of the Investment 
</P>
<P>
Many people see the cost of paying a line holder as a part of their investment, 
which they will recoup through the appreciation of the house. Though Fieldstone 
has not set the prices for the next release of homes at Alga Hills, campers say 
rumor has it that prices will go up by about $15,000, dwarfing the $480 it 
would cost to pay a sitter for, say, eight days. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one home shopper who arrived too late to get a place in line at Alga 
Hills offered several line holders $5,000 for their spots. No one accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in line is a happy camper, however. During the course of the Alga 
Hills camp out, rumors flew that the professional with the first spot in line, 
who customarily takes roll and maintains the official list of who is in line, 
was receiving kickbacks from other professional line holders or was favoring 
other professionals at the expense of the actual buyers camping out. 
</P>
<P>
Although the rumors could not be confirmed, the unhappiness was strong enough 
that Alga Hills sales manager Stacy Foster said she would bar that particular 
line holder from Fieldstone developments. 
</P>
<P>
As professional line holding has grown, hard feelings seemingly have become 
common at camp-outs. "There is a lot of confusion, misunderstanding and 
fighting," said Bernadette Cascio, owner of House Sitters International, one of 
the originators of professional line sitting. "I have heard the stories about 
kickbacks as well." 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, some developers refuse to allow camp-outs or have abandoned 
them. "I think camp-outs are dehumanizing," said William Probert, vice 
president of sales and marketing at Presley of San Diego home builders. "Nobody 
should have to go through one." 
</P>
<P>
McMillin Communities allowed camp-outs until a year ago, when it switched to a 
priority system. Presley also uses a priority system in which people on an 
interest list return postcards to establish a priority list. They then must 
periodically check in to maintain their place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Company Uses Lottery 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Baldwin halted camp-outs as well. "There was a widespread feeling 
that they were uncomfortable and inconvenient," said Sandra J. Perlatti, vice 
president, sales and marketing. After experimenting with a priority list, the 
company instituted a lottery for its Paloma project in San Marcos this April. 
Within two weeks, the company sold the 100 homes in the first phase of the 
650-unit development. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Fieldstone defends camp-outs as the fairest method for 
determining who gets to buy homes. "In my experience with lotteries, you have 
had to submit everything but your dental records, and then never get called," 
said Foster. 
</P>
<P>
Added Presley's Probert: "Lotteries make buying a home a chance thing. It 
shouldn't be a chance thing." 
</P>
<P>
The problem with a check-in system, as opposed to round-the-clock camping, 
Foster said, is "everyday somebody has a story why they couldn't check in." The 
drawback with priority lists, Baldwin's Perlatti pointed out, is that, "by the 
time somebody expresses interest, they may be number 2,000 on the list," which 
can be discouraging. 
</P>
<P>
That can be minimized, Probert argued, by systematically purging the list to 
identify the real potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, Perlatti said, "All three are viable procedures, 
depending on the project." 
</P>
<P>
Fieldstone officials seem genuinely concerned about the potential for abuse in 
the camp-out system. "We don't want professional line sitters soliciting 
potential buyers," Foster said. But the company also seems committed to 
allowing camp-outs to occur. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even the winners at Alga Hills seemed troubled by the process. Though he 
is enthusiastic about his new home, Ira Abrams said, "I am not saying it is 
fair. But it is the system."

OWNER OF CONSUELO'S NAMED PRESIDENT OF RESTAURANT GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHRIS KRAUL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robin Davis, owner of Consuelo's restaurant in La Jolla, has been named 
president of the 460-member San Diego Restaurant Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who purchased Consuelo's in 1974 from founder Dorothy Bales, at one time 
operated at four locations but has sold off all but the La Jolla Consuelo's, in 
the courtyard of the Merrill Lynch office building at Fay and Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
The single location is much to her liking, in part because she has only nine 
employees to worry about, instead of the 90 she had at one point. 
</P>
<P>
"The macho types I sold (the other Consuelo's locations) to all went out of 
business in a matter of months," Davis said. "Some people think all there is to 
running a restaurant is standing around at the bar, buying pretty girls 
drinks." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said she is very much a hands-on owner, busing orders, mixing drinks, 
buying produce, seating customers and washing the linen. The high points in her 
restaurant career have been "meeting so many people." The low point: getting 
held up by a robber wielding a sawed-off shotgun. "One of the waitresses saw 
the robber," Davis said. "She thought I was buying a gun." 
</P>
<P>
Born in San Diego into a Navy family, which moved to several bases around the 
country, Davis resettled in San Diego after her Navy pilot husband was killed 
in a bombing raid over Vietnam in 1966. After trying her hand as a real estate 
agent, Davis decided to buy a restaurant in hopes of a steadier income. 
</P>
<P>
As president of the association, Davis will represent the membership on a 
number of issues pertaining to restaurant owners. The issue that members are 
most concerned with these days, she said, is a bill before the state 
Legislature that would require all employers, including restaurants, to provide 
mandatory health insurance for employees. Such a bill would significantly raise 
the cost of running a restaurant, she said. CHRIS KRAUL

SWEATING OUT COMPLETION OF THE CONVENTION CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Champagne, brass bands and ribbon cutting notwithstanding, the National Spa and 
Pool Institute says being among the first convention groups to stage a show in 
the San Diego Convention Center is a dubious honor. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if NSPI vice president Larry Jennings had it to do over again, he 
would reschedule his Alexandria, Va.-based trade association to be the 
convention center's "first anniversary" group in January, 1991, giving the 
center a year to get the kinks worked out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Jennings, whose 5,000-delegate group is due Jan. 10, is sweating out 
the completion of the structure. Why the trepidation? Jennings frankly 
confessed in an interview this week that the delays and snags that have 
attended the construction of the $165-million center have unnerved him and his 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent scare came last month when San Diego Fire Marshal Jim Sewell 
declared that the convention center's sprinkler system was unacceptable because 
some of the sprinkler heads in the fire-safety system were obstructed by light 
fixtures. Sewell's initial ruling was that the entire ballroom's sprinkler 
system would have to be moved, a considerable and costly undertaking, before 
the convention center owner, the San Diego Port District, could receive a 
certificate of occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
The fire marshal's ruling set of a round of finger-pointing among the 
convention center architects, contractors and construction management firm over 
who was to blame, how best to alleviate the problem and who should pay for it. 
The story also sent shudders through the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors 
Bureau (ConVis), which markets the 760,000-square foot facility. The convention 
center's credibility has been damaged enough by past delays, ConVis officials 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
The sprinkler problem now seems to have been solved, at least partially, say 
Sewell and project manager Billy G. Crockett of Fluor Constructors, who was 
hired by the port district to oversee construction. The subcontractor 
responsible for the sprinkler system apparently built an "excess number of 
sprinklers" into the ceiling, sources said, meaning that even with the 
obstructions, the water coverage will be adequate to meet fire safety 
standards. A test by the fire marshal's office last Friday confirmed the 
adequacy. 
</P>
<P>
Sewell said a new sprinkler system still has to be built in some of the 
convention's meeting rooms, but, according to Crockett, there is ample time for 
the new system to be in place and not delay the center's opening. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Jennings isn't resting easy, largely because there is so little margin 
for error. He suffered another scare over the summer when 60% of the convention 
center's construction crew walked off the job for 2 1/2 days to protest a 
non-union crew being called in to work on the convention center's kitchen. A 
protracted strike was averted when the non-union work crew agreed to organize. 
Theft of some of the center's aluminum molding and glass also disrupted the 
construction schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a whole lot of fun being the first group," Jennings said this week. 
Actually, the NSPI and its 5,000 delegates will be the center's second major 
out-of-town occupant after Young Life, a 3,000-delegate evangelical Christian 
organization from Colorado Springs that's due in Jan. 3. CHRIS KRAUL Although 
the convention center opens its doors to local groups and meetings in November, 
the first two months are seen as a "shakedown phase" to train staff in the 
center's operating procedures, marketing director Carroll Armstrong said. The 
first two months will also be used to promote local good-will for the center. 
Toward that end, the convention center management is planning a three-day 
"Community Celebration" over Thanksgiving Day weekend. San Diegans will be 
invited to tour the center during the weekend, and nonprofit groups will be 
allowed to set up booths in the center free of charge. Entertainment is 
planned, and food prepared by the convention center's food service department 
will be available at "reasonable" prices, Armstrong said. That the convention 
center will be an economic dynamo throwing off profits to local businesses, 
particularly hotels, has become accepted local doctrine. According to ConVis, 
the center will draw 171,200 more convention delegates to San Diego in 1990, or 
25% more than total conventioneers in 1988, resulting in the sale of an 
estimated 252,000 more hotel room nights, a 30% increase in hotel room nights 
sold to conventioneers over 1988. But other kinds of businesses will benefit as 
well. And assisting those businesses in getting their fair share of the 
convention center windfall is the purpose of a series of seminars to start in 
October, sponsored by ConVis. Visitors will be given advice in catering to 
conventioneers' needs in transportation, food service, shopping and special 
events. Those interested in attending may call ConVis at 232-3101, Ext. 107.

Nugzar Ruhadze, the first Soviet journalist to work for a television station in 
the United States, has completed a four-month stint at WXIA-TV in Atlanta and 
is heading home with one major impression of Americans: their eagerness for 
peace between the two nations. The message that he takes with him, he says, is 
that "it is high time for us to be in closer touch, to be cooperating and to be 
seeking love and friendship." While here, he produced stories on such topics as 
Memorial Day, U.S. prisons, flag burning and the differences between the poor 
and rich in America. WXIA hopes to bring back Ruhadze for six weeks in April, 
barring objections from Soviet authorities. ALEENE MacMINN

The wife of rock singer John Cougar Mellencamp has filed for divorce after 
eight years of marriage. The attorney for Victoria L. Mellencamp, 30, of 
Bloomington, Ind., confirmed the action but declined to discuss the case. The 
couple have been separated since May, 1988. Victoria Mellencamp filed the 
petition four days after the birth of the singer's first grandchild, Elexis 
Suzanne Peach. The baby's mother, Michelle Peach, 18, is the daughter of the 
37-year-old Mellencamp and his first wife, Priscilla. Victoria Mellencamp is 
seeking custody of and child support for the couple's two children, Teddi Joe,

Hal Who?: Actor Hal Linden finds that he is probably eternally typecast as 
"Barney Miller," the laconic New York police captain of the popular 1975-82 TV 
series. At a recent celebrity golf tournament in Vail, Colo., his golf clubs 
seemed to have disappeared in the clubhouse. Linden said they were finally 
found by the manager, who admitted with some embarrassment that they were 
stored under "Miller." "As long as they know me some way, I don't mind," said 
Miller . . . er, ah, Linden. ALEENE MacMINN

SOCIAL CLUB FINDS IT'S NOT SO FAR FROM DECEMBER TO MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Charles Roberts' parents never said anything, but he could tell that they 
disapproved by the looks on their faces. Roberts, a 35-year-old chemical 
engineer who lives in Eagle Rock, likes older women -- 20 or 30 years older. 
From time to time, he said he's gone out with women closer to his own age, but 
"I just don't seem to get excited about the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts was one of half a dozen men in their 20s and 30s at a recent 
brunch-time meeting of the DecMay Club at a Wilshire Boulevard hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The group, made up of nonsmokers interested in meeting older women or younger 
men, is neither shocked at the youthfulness of some of Cher's beaus nor 
horrified at the recent marriage of fashion designer Mary McFadden, 53, to 
Kohle Yohannon, 22. Nobody snickers at the notion of a man choosing to be with 
a woman old enough to be his mother or even his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1984 by Phyllis Sidney, the club has a core of about 30 active 
members, said Sidney, a designer of fashion accessories. At the brunch, the 
ratio of men to women was about 3 to 1. But that was a fluke, Sidney said. 
Usually the number of men and women is about equal. 
</P>
<P>
Judie Gold, who described herself as "57 going on 25" and was at her first club 
meeting, said she thought that the mix was perfect. "This is a lovely turnout," 
said Gold, assistant to the head of TV at Motown Productions. "Ask any woman." 
</P>
<P>
Sidney, who is 60 and lives in West Hollywood, said she started the group 
because there was no safe, comfortable place for women such as herself to meet 
the younger men they prefer. Sidney, who used to joke to friends that their 
sons were too old for her, said she finds that she likes men "up to about 40." 
</P>
<P>
Bars weren't the answer for Sidney. And at most singles events, she found, the 
expectation was that women, at least, would show interest only in men their own 
age or older. 
</P>
<P>
"I would approach a man I found attractive and that I thought was appropriate, 
and he would look at me with complete bewilderment," she said. Sidney ran an ad 
proposing the unusual social club in a local alternative newspaper. "Eleven 
people showed up at the first meeting." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Sidney said, an organization that aids December-May liaisons for 
women "was considered beyond avant-garde -- it was considered sick." One of the 
best things about the group, members say, is that they don't have to deny, 
explain or justify preferences that some people regard as odd, comic or even 
distasteful. "Everybody who comes here knows why they're here," Sidney said. 
</P>
<P>
The club, which runs ads in singles publications, meets as often as five times 
a month for brunch, picnics and parties at members' homes. Dues are $20 for six 
months. So far, the organization hasn't resulted in a wedding but, Sidney said, 
"there's been a lot of dating going on." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group, which is open to people of any age, say they don't accept 
the conventional view that women become less desirable as they age. 
</P>
<P>
"I find their experience attractive," said Robert James of Long Beach. "I like 
going out with a woman who already knows what she wants," said James, who looks 
even younger than his 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney said she was married to an older man for 16 "yucky" years. She turned to 
younger men because "men my own age would try to sabotage me. I've never found 
a young man who would do that." 
</P>
<P>
She said her male contemporaries tend to be domineering, patronizing or worse 
toward women. "Older men presume a lot," she said. "I don't need someone to 
tell me to cross the street. If I need a man, I need a man. All my experiences 
with younger men have been delightful. Younger men don't feel that they have to 
be in charge of the world, in charge of everything." 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, she said, "with younger men, I could be who I really am." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeps Spirits Up 
</P>
<P>
Sidney said she finds it easier to find like-minded companions among young men, 
but she wouldn't say no to the right silver-haired man. "I would go out with a 
man my own age if he was playful, if he was helpful," she said. She also said 
she finds that younger men are more fun. Her profession -- designing bows and 
other decorations for women's hair -- is demanding, creative work, "and I need 
to keep my spirits up." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the men at the brunch chose not to be interviewed. Others said they 
felt comfortable with older women in ways they did not feel with women their 
own age. James said he doesn't think he is particularly attractive to female 
contemporaries because they place so much emphasis on appearance and status. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a very glamorous life style," said James, who works in retail and 
goes to college part time. "What I have to offer women are not things that can 
be bought." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Holland, 28, of Glendale, who has dated a woman 20 years his senior, said 
he likes the independence that so many older woman show -- "they take control 
of their own agenda." Holland, who runs an equipment rental business, said he 
thinks that "there's more pretense involved in relationships with younger 
women." 
</P>
<P>
As did several other club members, Holland said he would not be put off by an 
older woman's inability to have children since he doesn't particularly want to 
have children of his own. Holland said he has not discussed his interest in 
older women with his family, "but my friends respect my choice." 
</P>
<P>
Sidney said she has only once had to ask someone who came to a meeting not to 
come back. He was a problem drinker, she said. As to the possibility that some 
young hustler will join the club in hopes of meeting and exploiting a wealthy 
older woman, Sidney doesn't worry about it. "These are all older women, and 
they can take care of themselves."

COUNCIL APPROVES LIMITS ON HOUSING; 
</P>
<P>
TOUGH ORDINANCE TO CURB 'MANSIONIZATION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a series of stringent 
restrictions on all new single-family houses and all but minor home additions. 
</P>
<P>
The council action was hailed by proponents as the beginning of the end of 
Glendale's "mansionization." Opponents called the measure an infringement on 
property rights. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary ordinance will last from one to two years. During that time, the 
city planning staff will prepare a permanent ordinance to regulate construction 
according to each neighborhood's characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporary Ordinance 
</P>
<P>
The temporary ordinance applies to all new single-family houses and house 
additions of more than 700 square feet. It generally limits new construction to 
no more than two stories and requires the front setback to be consistent with 
the average of houses within 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the city will impose parking and landscaping requirements 
on single-family houses. The ordinance requires two to five enclosed parking 
spaces, depending on floor area, for all new houses or alterations. It requires 
landscaping on at least 30% of the lot and limits the building area to 30% of 
the lot. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also establishes limits on floor-area ratio -- the relation of 
floor space to the lot area -- according to lot size. 
</P>
<P>
As the lot grows larger, the size of the building shrinks in proportion to the 
lot. The reason for this, City Planner John McKenna said, is to prevent a 
developer from buying several lots for one giant house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Design Review Board 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance subjects all new construction to Design Review Board approval. 
But the board can void the restrictions in the ordinance if the building is 
compatible with the neighborhood and would not go beyond the standards set by 
surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"These numbers are simply guidelines," Mayor Jerold Milner said. "We would hope 
and in fact we expect the Design Review Boards to exercise their discretion in 
approving the kind of projects that are compatible with their neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
The council vote came after two extensive public comment sessions in City Hall 
before standing-room-only crowds that spilled into hallways and the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's audience was also divided. Residents planning to sell their homes or 
make large additions, architects, realtors and other building industry members 
opposed the ordinance. Representatives of homeowner associations and individual 
residents who had been angered by nearby construction praised the council's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Carter, president of the Northwestern Glendale Homeowners Assn., which 
brought the mansionization problem to the council, said, "The facts are 
unavoidable. Mansion homes are being built all over the city. We came to the 
council for relief, and we got it." 
</P>
<P>
But others protested what they termed government interference with their right 
to design and build their dream houses. 
</P>
<P>
"Design Review Boards are politically appointed, have mediocre standards and 
lack imagination," said Robert Burman, a Glendale architect. "They deprive 
architects of their freedom of expression and are responsible for the mediocre 
construction in Glendale. Visionaries like Frank Lloyd Wright would be driven 
out of town." 
</P>
<P>
"This is further erosion of rights, a further erosion of freedom and I don't 
like it," said John F. Day, who retired in April after 12 years on the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
"If there were in fact a problem, would Glendale be threatened?" he asked. "I 
don't think so. We've lived with the Eiffel Tower, and we've lived with the 
Transamerica building in San Francisco, which we thought was horrendous and now 
we think it's nice. 
</P>
<P>
Day, who was planning an addition to his house, asked the council to delay its 
decision so that he could study the ordinance's effect on his situation. 
</P>
<P>
The trend toward mansionization -- tearing down existing houses and building 
new ones that nearly fill the lots -- has provoked adverse reactions in several 
parts of Los Angeles County, particularly in some Westside communities. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills and Los Angeles have recently adopted anti-mansionization 
measures. San Marino and La Canada Flintridge have similar ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the council's ongoing, 18-month struggle to agree on zoning 
restrictions for apartment neighborhoods, it moved swiftly on imposing controls 
on single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The Northwestern Glendale Homeowners Assn. first brought up mansionization at a 
July 25 council meeting. About 20 members of the newly formed association 
attended the meeting to complain about construction of a 7,150-square-foot 
building in their neighborhood and to ask for floor-area ratio restrictions on 
single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
The same day, Milner called for an Aug. 15 study session on mansionization. 
During that session, the council instructed its planning staff to prepare the 
ordinance adopted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will take effect 30 days after adoption.

VOTE ON ENDING APARTMENT BAN PUT OFF FOR 18TH TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer

<P>
For the last nine months, developer Haik Vartanian has gone to Glendale City 
Council meetings in hopes that council members would adopt or even vote on an 
ordinance that would end the city's year-old moratorium on apartment 
construction. On Tuesday, he was disappointed again -- the ordinance was 
postponed for the 18th time. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium-ending ordinance, which would change design standards in 
apartment neighborhoods, has become a fixture on the agenda for council 
meetings and a constant source of disillusionment to Vartanian and a small 
group of developers who are now City Hall regulars. Their projects in the final 
plan-approval stages have been stalled by the building freeze. They are eager 
to get them moving again. 
</P>
<P>
They will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
A memorandum by Planning Director John McKenna to City Manager David Ramsay 
made public this week advises council members to defer action on the ordinance 
until council members agree on temporary zoning controls. The controls are 
aimed at preventing a population explosion while the city establishes permanent 
zoning changes -- a process that would take about two years. 
</P>
<P>
In the memorandum, written Aug. 24 and released this week by Councilwoman 
Ginger Bremberg, McKenna advises council members to delay ending the moratorium 
until they can resolve issues that are not dealt with in the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"If consensus amongst council members is reached on the 'Design Ordinance,' 
defer action on the ordinance until the other topics . . . are also resolved. . 
. ," it recommends. The document fueled long-held suspicions by developers that 
the council was purposely dragging its feet on the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows that the moratorium will last a lot longer than what the city openly 
represented," said Edwin Shriver, who represents the group of developers led by 
Vartanian. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously adopted the moratorium in September to prevent an 
overflow of building applications while the city considered zoning changes to 
control growth. Two months later, the planning staff introduced a draft 
ordinance proposing zoning changes that council members saw as the solution to 
the city's growth problems. 
</P>
<P>
But months later, council members acknowledged that the proposed ordinance 
would do little more than improve the city's aesthetic appearance and began 
calling it the "design ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council extended the moratorium for the third time in July to 
February, 1990, or until the design ordinance is adopted. Council members said 
the moratorium extensions were needed to examine the ordinance carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Council members say they want to adopt the design restrictions featured in the 
ordinance, but are not willing to end the moratorium until they agree on and 
implement zoning restrictions limiting the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to agree on what these restrictions should be, at least two council 
members said they are waiting for the result of the land-use survey being 
conducted by the city planning staff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Studying Measures 
</P>
<P>
The survey, which will take at least two more months to complete, will help 
council members determine what measures are necessary to keep the city's 
population from exceeding 220,000, which is recommended by the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
The memorandum released this week also warns that adopting the design ordinance 
and concurrently enacting a new moratorium is not defensible in court, 
according to Senior Assistant City Atty. Scott H. Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Vartanian and a group of fellow developers with projects halted by the 
moratorium have sued the city for not processing their building permits even 
though they were requested before the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
A second lawsuit by the same group, representing some 25 projects, challenges 
the validity of the moratorium's three extensions. A Los Angeles Superior Court 
judge ruled in favor of the developers in the first lawsuit, but the city 
appealed the decision and an appellate court decision is pending. The second 
suit has been delayed until the first one is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Since March, the council has done little more that go over the ordinance line 
by line, then ask the staff to make some changes, then go over it line by line 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure we do it right," said Mayor Jerold Milner. More often 
than not, however, the design ordinance is continued to the following week 
because, as Milner has repeated several times, "we don't have time to get 
around to it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Agreement 
</P>
<P>
As McKenna's memorandum points out, the reason that the moratorium continues is 
that council members can't agree on temporary growth control measures. In July 
and again last month, Councilman Carl Raggio introduced an ordinance that would 
reduce by half the number of apartment units allowed per lot. On both 
occasions, the proposal fell short of the four-vote majority needed to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Dick Jutras and Larry Zarian blocked the proposal. They argued that 
it is too drastic and would allow the real estate market to stagnate by raising 
property values beyond the range of all but a few. Zoning laws require at least 
a 4-1 majority. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as a temporary ordinance in Glendale," Zarian said. 
"What kind of message do you think we would be sending to our planning staff if 
we adopted the 50% reductions?" 
</P>
<P>
Since the council stalemate on the moratorium issue, the planning staff has 
redirected its emphasis toward controlling " mansionization" in single-family 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They're in Limbo' 
</P>
<P>
As the discussion drags on, Shriver complains that developers are not only 
being denied the opportunity to do their work, but must pay interest on the 
land and property taxes. "They're in limbo," he said. "Some of my clients are 
small developers and simply can't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the courts will react very strongly when they find out that the 
moratorium, which was supposed to be an interim measure while the city resolved 
some design issues, is not going to be resolved in the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay, who returned from vacation this week, said he had not read McKenna's 
memorandum. He said the design ordinance continues to appear in the council 
agenda because "the council has requested it. It is a complex issue and they 
want to go over it line by line. I think they are very close to being done." 
</P>
<P>
Vartanian isn't holding his breath. "The council's consideration so far has 
been less than zero, and I don't expect any changes."

TIGERS AFTER MORE THAN SCIAC TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
WIDOLFF SEEKS A PLAYOFF BERTH AS FITTING END TO A SUCCESSFUL DECADE 
</P>

<P>
Occidental College, home of the dominant football team of the decade in the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, is looking to close 
out the 1980s in style. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, winners of two consecutive conference championships and six titles 
in the past seven years, are prowling for a larger reward this season -- a trip 
to the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
With five offensive starters, including quarterback Tony Werbelow, and nine 
defensive starters back from a team that finished 8-1 last season, the Tigers 
appear primed to make a run at their first playoff berth since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have more depth than we've ever had," said Occidental Coach Dale 
Widolff, who has guided the Tigers for seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Linebackers David Hodges and Pete Tucker and defensive end Brady Dargan -- all 
of whom were all-conference selections last season -- anchor a defense that 
recorded two shutouts in 1988, surrendered a conference-low 252.2 yards a game 
and allowed an average of 11.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Werbelow, a senior, was fourth in Division III in passing efficiency, 
completing 103 of 149 attempts for 1,135 yards and eight touchdowns while 
throwing just two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony has a real strong arm and those other things you want," Widolff said. 
"He's a very strong leader and makes good decisions. That's the key thing for 
me -- not forcing the ball, checking your team out of a bad play based on 
defensive front and coverage, things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's receiving corps returns virtually intact: wide receiver Rick 
Freeman, who had a team-high 30 receptions, wideout Rob Leinbach and tight end 
David Grossklaus. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, however, will not be pass-crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"We developed a philosophy here that we think is pretty sound," Widolff said. 
"Last year, we threw as little as five passes a game and as many as 35. Our 
priority is we want to run the football." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Vegas, who rushed for 455 yards and seven touchdowns last season, will be 
the Tigers' main threat and will operate behind an offensive line led by guard 
Roger Laubengayer, who was selected to the Sporting News' preseason Division 
III All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental opens its season at home Saturday night against Menlo College. The 
race for the SCIAC title begins Sept. 23 against Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
"The team that I think needs to be watched quite a bit is Redlands," Widolff 
said. "Rumor has it that they had a huge recruiting class." 
</P>
<P>
Redlands finished 6-3 last season in Mike Maynard's first year as coach. 
Claremont might also provide a challenge.

THE CICUTO ERA EXPECTED TO LOOK MUCH LIKE THE SARTORIS YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Cicuto's 13 seasons as defensive coordinator for the Glendale College 
football program were noteworthy for the charge he gave his players and the 
dominant play his emotional nature inspired. 
</P>
<P>
Cicuto's audience and responsibilities are larger this season now that he has 
ascended to the position of head coach of the Vaqueros, replacing long-time 
mentor Jim Sartoris. 
</P>
<P>
However there figures to be little change in Cicuto's firebrand style. 
</P>
<P>
"The philosophy of the program, will never change," said Cicuto, 44. "But there 
are some differences between Sartoris and myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably a little bit more of an emotional type of a person . . . and I 
think they'll (the players) reflect that. I don't know if that will be good or 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
First impressions suggest it could be a change for the better as Glendale 
looked impressive last Saturday in its scrimmage with Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros begin their season Saturday at 1:30 p.m. when they play host to 
Pasadena City College at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale has 41 lettermen back from a team that was 10-2 overall and 8-1 in 
Western State Conference play last season, defeating Santa Monica, 23-20, in 
the inaugural WSC Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of Sartoris, who compiled a record of 111-64-1 in 17 
seasons, the Vaqueros are ranked 17th in the nation by USA Today and ninth in 
the state by the JC Athletic Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's going to be much change in that (Glendale) program," 
Pasadena City College Coach Dennis Gossard said. "Why change something when 
it's not broke? When you've enjoyed as much success as they have there isn't a 
need." 
</P>
<P>
With eight returning starters, a trio of talented transfers and an abundance of 
excellent freshmen, offense could be Glendale's strength this season. 
</P>
<P>
Running backs Sean Hampton and Doug Dragomer are both back after productive 
freshman seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton, an all-conference performer who played at Sylmar High, rushed for 
1,064 yards and scored 10 touchdowns last season. Dragomer, who played at 
Burroughs, rushed for 987 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some good backs here," Cicuto said, "but those two could be the best 
we've had here at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Darren Fitzgerald enters the season as the starting quarterback, but 
he figures to get a season-long challenge from Ronnie Lopez, the former City 
Section 3-A co-Player of the Year from Franklin High. Lopez transferred from 
Pierce, along with tight end Jason Teitel and running back Wes Bender. 
</P>
<P>
And with freshman Marco Arcipreste from Burroughs, the Vaqueros start the 
season with three talented quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive line, led by all-conference guard Chris Allen and tackle Anthony 
Navarro, is virtually unchanged from last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to an offense that can take a little pressure off our 
defense at the beginning of the year," Cicuto said. "Because if I was to say we 
have a weakness, it would be the inexperience we have on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of talent, but they haven't played a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Nose guard Chad Keiser, who was all-conference last season, and lineman Damon 
Hinton, who was all-conference in 1987 and redshirted last season, are the most 
experienced defensive players. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-team WSC is split into two divisions. Winners of each division are 
eligible for the WSC Bowl, but may accept bids to other bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale will compete in the WSC's Northern Division with Moorpark (9-1 overall 
last season), Santa Barbara (4-6), Ventura (5-5), Los Angeles Southwest (5-5) 
and Harbor (1-10). 
</P>
<P>
The WSC's Southern Division includes defending national champion Bakersfield 
(10-0), Santa Monica (6-4), Valley (6-4), Compton (3-7), Pierce (1-9) and West 
L. A. (0-10). 
</P>
<P>
Besides their division opponents, the Vaqueros will also meet Bakersfield and 
Santa Monica this season. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield Coach Carl Bowser has no doubts that Cicuto is ready for the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a dominant type of coach," Bowser said. "As a first-year coach, you get 
fired up anyway. I don't think he'll have any trouble getting his players to be 
the same."

'STAR WARS' GOAL CUT, QUAYLE SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE ROLE TO BE LIMITED; CALLS REAGAN'S PLAN 'POLITICAL JARGON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Conceding that former President Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" plan was only 
"political jargon," Vice President Dan Quayle said Wednesday that the missile 
defense concept has been revised into a smaller and cheaper program without the 
pretense of being able to deflect a massive Soviet first strike. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle said the Bush Administration's revised plan is intended only to cope 
with a limited Soviet attack or with the sort of missile strike that could be 
mounted by a Third World nation that might acquire a small arsenal of 
relatively unsophisticated rockets. 
</P>
<P>
"We have redefined (Star Wars and) put it into missions, requirements, doctrine 
and strategy much differently than we did in the early 1980s," Quayle said 
during a lunch with editors and reporters of The Times Washington Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once Staunch Supporter 
</P>
<P>
The vice president was once a staunch supporter of the proposal, officially 
known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, which Reagan said would end the 
danger of nuclear war by making atomic weapons "impotent." But Quayle admitted 
Wednesday that the plan was never realistic. 
</P>
<P>
He said Reagan "talked about this impenetrable shield that was going to be 
completely leak proof. . . . I believe that, in the semantics of let's say 
political jargon, that that was acceptable. But it clearly was stretching the 
capability of a strategic defense system." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the system that Reagan said could protect U.S. cities, Quayle said 
the Bush Administration is supporting a plan called "Brilliant Pebbles" which 
would release swarms of mini-missiles to track incoming rockets. He declined to 
estimate the cost of the revised program, but said it would cost far less than 
the Reagan Administration's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the plan, which is still in the research stage, is to thin out a 
flight of incoming missiles, but it makes no claim of being able to get them 
all. As a defense system for the U.S. retaliatory missile force, the system 
might be effective. But supporters of the plan admit it would be of almost no 
use in defending a city because even a single warhead could do incredible 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials have expressed growing skepticism about the 
original "Star Wars" concept in recent months. But Quayle, as the 
highest-ranking of ficial to raise doubts about the plan, seemed to finish it 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle said the Bush proposal could not turn back an "all out, bolt out of the 
blue attack" by the Soviet Union. But he said it could be effective against a 
limited Soviet attack and might protect the nation from accidental missile 
launches or from attacks by other nations that recently have acquired missile 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
He implied that the Administration's more modest objectives might go a long way 
toward removing a major obstacle to a U.S.-Soviet agreement to reduce strategic 
offensive weapons. In the past, Moscow has insisted on stringent limits on the 
U.S. missile defense program as part of any strategic arms agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But Quayle made it clear that he continues to consider Moscow to be a dangerous 
adversary, despite Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's relaxation of 
central control over the nations of Eastern Europe and the constituent 
republics that make up the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
He said the West has begun exploring how to "manage the decline of the Soviet 
empire." This planning, he indicated, includes contingency plans for dealing 
with a Soviet crackdown on reform policies in Poland or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there have been discussions much more along the lines of 'OK, if you 
(the Soviet Union) are going to open up and then there would be a clamp down . 
. . ,' " he said without finishing the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Heartened' by Poland 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to get away from the wild euphoria that somehow this 
transition and change is going to come in the real near term," he said. "We are 
very heartened by what's happened in Poland. Poland has made tremendous 
progress. We're heartened by what is beginning to happen in Hungary. But we're 
also realists and look at statements that are coming out toward the Baltic 
states. . . . Let us remind ourselves that we're still dealing with a 
totalitarian government and there are going to be bumps along the transition." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle responded to questions, most of them focused on foreign policy, for more 
than an hour without referring to notes or other references. Although he showed 
brief flashes of the self-deprecating humor that he often uses to defuse 
criticism, the vice president appeared confident throughout. He dismissed 
opinion polls that indicate the public is skeptical of his ability to assume 
the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not worry about polls," Quayle said. "I'm not there to look at my polling 
numbers. I'm there to look at the President's polling numbers and see how the 
President is doing. This President is doing quite well in terms of the American 
public. I'm part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
On a domestic topic, Quayle said Bush hopes to be able to sign a child-care 
bill this year. But he said the President would not hesitate to veto a 
Democratic-backed bill that he considers too costly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush 'Firmly Committed' 
</P>
<P>
"This President has submitted a child-care proposal," Quayle said. "He's firmly 
committed to his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say a good precedent is the minimum wage proposal," he added. "The 
President said this is unacceptable as it stands. The Congress went ahead for, 
I believe, basically political reasons and tried to put the President in a 
corner. He vetoed it. As a result, we don't have a minimum wage bill. I don't 
think they want to do the same thing on child care, but that will be their 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has proposed a child tax credit for poor families, assuming that the 
recipients will use the money for child care and that they will be able to find 
the services they need. The Democrats are backing a bill that would provide 
states with money not only to offset poor families' child-care payments but 
that would expand and enhance child-care facilities.

NAVY FINDS IOWA EXPLOSION WAS RESULT OF 'SUICIDAL ACT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and MELISSA HEALY, Times Staff Writers 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy has determined that the battleship Iowa explosion that killed 47 
sailors last April was caused by a "suicidal act" by Gunner's Mate Clayton M. 
Hartwig, who died in the blast, according to congressional officials who were 
briefed on the Navy's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,100-page Navy investigation report, due to be released today, said that 
extensive tests showed Hartwig had loaded a shell improperly into one of the 
ship's 16-inch guns to make room for a homemade detonator that triggered the 
devastating blast. 
</P>
<P>
Hartwig pushed the shell several inches further forward in the gun barrel than 
it should have been to leave a space for the device between the first and 
second silk-wrapped bags of gunpowder, which are loaded directly behind the 
shell. 
</P>
<P>
Painstaking forensic tests, which cost the Navy more than $4 million, found 
traces of a "foreign object" that proved to be the detonator, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have very specific material evidence" that points to a deliberate 
suicidal act, said a member of the House Armed Services Committee, who was 
briefed on the Navy report. "They have ruled out everything except suicide," 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy also prepared a detailed psychological profile of the young sailor, 
which concluded that he was suicidal and had told friends that he "wanted to 
die in action and be buried at Arlington" National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy briefers made no mention of Hartwig's alleged homosexuality, which had 
been an earlier focus of the investigation. Hartwig, 24, had been rumored to be 
despondent over his rejection by a recent ly married male shipmate, Petty 
Officer Kendall L. Truitt. 
</P>
<P>
Hartwig's parents and sister, Kathleen M. Kubicina, are to be briefed on the 
report by a Navy captain this morning at her home in Cleveland. Naval officers 
also fanned out across the nation to relay the report's findings to the 
families of each of the 47 sailors who died in the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contests Conclusions 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Kubicina vigorously contested the Navy's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother . . . was not a depressed, despondent, suicidal murderer," said 
Mrs. Kubicina, who had written to many U.S. officials in Hartwig's defense 
after her family learned that he had made Truitt the beneficiary of a $100,000 
life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy will not accept blame for the explosion and the sailors' deaths, 
beyond admitting failure to recognize Hartwig's psychological problems and 
remove him from such a sensitive post, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation uncovered laxity in crew training and gun maintenance aboard 
the Iowa, "but they didn't contribute" to the deadly explosion, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred as the No. 2 gun, the middle gun of three in the second 
turret, was being loaded for gunnery practice off Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speculation About Powder 
</P>
<P>
The guns and turret were designed in the late 1930s and use powder and shells 
manufactured more than 40 years ago in World War II. There had been speculation 
that the powder had been improperly stored and had become unstable. The Navy 
apparently rejected that as a cause of the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials had warned that the massive physical damage caused by the 
explosion and the deaths of all eyewitnesses would result in a largely 
inconclusive report. But they cited the decades-long history of safe firings 
from the 16-inch guns and said they would return to full service shortly after 
the report is made public. 
</P>
<P>
A day after the April 19 explosion, Adm. Carlisle A. H. Trost, chief of naval 
operations, declared a moratorium on the firing of the unique guns, which are 
in use only on the nation's four recommissioned battleships. In June, the Navy 
partly lifted the ban, allowing ships on deployment to use the guns to carry 
out military operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubts Ship at Fault 
</P>
<P>
"I put a restriction on the firing of the guns in the event that something is 
found that is common to the class. I doubt that will be the case, and I'm 
hopeful that the investigating team will find the actual cause of the 
explosion," Trost said recently. 
</P>
<P>
In late May, the Navy officially confirmed long-circulating reports that the 
investigation had "a criminal aspect to it," focusing on Hartwig and his 
relationship with Truitt. The two had been close friends, but with Truitt's 
marriage, they had drifted apart, Navy investigators found. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry focused early on the possibility that Hartwig and Truitt could have 
plotted together in a murder-suicide pact, according to reports. Truitt and his 
Miami attorney, Ellis Rubin, have widely denied those conjectures. On 
Wednesday, Rubin said his client planned to bring suit against the federal 
government for defamation of character. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Want an Apology' 
</P>
<P>
"Kendall Truitt's has become a household name around the world as a possible 
homosexual somehow involved in a homicidal plot, and we want an apology from 
those who leaked it in the first place," Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after hearing the results of the six-month investigation, Rep. 
Charles E. Bennett (D-Fla.), chairman of the House Armed Services seapower 
subcommittee, sent a letter to Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III demanding 
that the Navy revise its procedures to prevent a repetition of the Iowa 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said he urged the Navy to require two other sailors to inspect the work 
of the gunner who actually loads the charge into the battleship's 16-inch guns 
to ensure that he is following proper procedures. 
</P>
<P>

"Silence Equals Death," read the buttons worn by the busload of protesters who 
descended on the National Institutes of Health last February to demand access 
to an experimental AIDS drug that showed promise but had not yet been 
thoroughly tested. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour meeting, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the NIH official responsible 
for all federal AIDS research and a scientist that the protesters had once 
labeled a "murderer" and a "Nazi," surprised the protesters by promising to 
intervene on their behalf. Within months, the drug was released. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a breakthrough moment," recalls AIDS activist Jim Eigo. After three 
years of effort, Eigo and others like him were on their way to winning an 
across-the-board acceleration of the approval process for experimental AIDS 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
It was a breakthrough for more than AIDS drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Profound Change 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS activists' desperate assault on the scientific and governmental 
agencies that develop, test and approve new prescription drugs is producing a 
profound change in the way those agencies handle all kinds of experimental 
drugs involving critical, life-threatening diseases -- not just those dealing 
with AIDS. It is not only accelerating the process but creating a new 
atmosphere -- a presumption favoring action over delay. 
</P>
<P>
And to most scientists and government officials, the change is a welcome one. 
The pendulum had swung too far in the direction of caution at the Food and Drug 
Administration, the government agency responsible for approving new drugs, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some also raise a yellow caution flag, warning that the 
present trend could also cause serious problems if it should go too far, 
permitting ineffective or even dangerous drugs to reach patients with a wide 
range of life-threatening diseases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Compound Problems 
</P>
<P>
Confrontational tactics of the kind pioneered by AIDS activists could, if 
applied inappropriately, damage the basic research and testing processes of 
science, for instance. Or the commendable streamlining of government 
procedures, if carried too far, could erode necessary safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
Even critically ill patients who have few or no therapeutic alternatives need 
protection from inadequately tested drugs that could compound their problems, 
scientists caution. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody wants to do any harm to patients for the greater good of 
science, but the greater good of science is to learn as much as we can as fast 
as we can -- and as safely as we can," says Dr. Robert T. Schooley, an AIDS 
specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of AIDS, which was killing all who contracted it with brutal 
swiftness, activists argued that patients could not wait for the traditional 
testing procedures to run their course. They considered it largely irrelevant 
that new drugs might have dangerous side effects or prove ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
"The arithmetic is terrifyingly simple," said Larry Kramer, a New York writer 
and founder of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP). "An average study 
takes seven to 10 years. The average life after diagnosis with AIDS is two 
years. Of course, activists are screaming for faster access to treatments. 
Otherwise, most of us won't be here when the answers come." 
</P>
<P>
Before AIDS, the burden of proof was on the developers of a new drug to prove 
its safety and effectiveness. The FDA released new drugs only after the most 
rigorous testing in clinical trials -- a process that commonly took several 
years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rights of Victims 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS forced everybody to change how they thought about life-threatening 
diseases and the rights of people who are suffering from them," said Dr. Sam 
Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute. "AIDS raised everybody's 
consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
Now, where potentially fatal diseases are concerned, the regulators are far 
more inclined to move quickly and to seek ways for critically ill patients to 
obtain drugs that are promising but not yet thoroughly tested. 
</P>
<P>
"This will go to cancer and to Alzheimer's and to Parkinson's -- there's no 
question about it," said David Rothman, professor of social medicine at 
Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. "The AIDS community has been the 
shock troops of change. As the notion of consumers' rights advances in AIDS, it 
will inevitably be picked up by those with other diseases." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Sight of Needs 
</P>
<P>
Many members of the medical community believe the regulatory system has been so 
focused about producing scientifically valid information about new drugs that 
it has lost sight of patients' needs for quick help. 
</P>
<P>
Patients with critical diseases, they say, should have the right to decide 
whether to gamble on a drug that shows early promise. 
</P>
<P>
"Many drugs will be released with less knowledge," Rothman said. "But if you 
were a patient facing a terminal illness, wouldn't you want the ultimate right 
to make choices of risk and benefits? My answer would be: absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
Rothman acknowledged that the consequence might be some delay in gathering 
scientific data about the impact of some drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"But in all human experimentation, there is always conflict between the 
interests of the particular patients and the research community and outside 
society," he said. "Delays may ultimately benefit all future patients -- but 
not this particular patient at this particular moment. But should this 
particular patient be required to sacrifice his interest for the larger social 
good?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frustration, Suffering 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jerome Groopman, an AIDS researcher at New England Deaconess Hospital, 
still sees patients one day a week, and he said that he understands their 
frustration and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you step back and say: 'If this were my son, I'd go to the ends of 
the Earth to make sure he got something that could help him,' " Groopman said. 
"But if we totally demolish the scientific system, we'll never learn what we 
need to learn about drugs and how to use them. There's got to be a balance. 
Before AIDS, the balance was too far in the other direction. It was so 
restrictive that people couldn't get any access." 
</P>
<P>
Drug manufacturers, impatient with the pace of the old system, support the new 
philosophy, although they acknowledge that the changes may bring some new 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Liability is one of our concerns," said Dr. John C. Petricciani, vice 
president for medical and regulatory affairs of the Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers Assn. Risks are greater, he said, when drugs are made available 
earlier in the development process. 
</P>
<P>
"In principle," he quickly added, "I think most people agree that we'd all like 
to get life-saving drugs through the process as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accelerated the Trend 
</P>
<P>
If AIDS activists have speeded up the process, they have merely accelerated a 
trend that had been under way before. When Dr. Frank Young became FDA 
commissioner in 1984, he said: "I've been through the experience of literally 
having patients dying before my eyes while they're waiting for medicine to be 
approved that could save them." 
</P>
<P>
Under Young, the FDA has trimmed the average overall time it needs to approve a 
new drug from 7.8 years to 4.2 years. It also has injected new life into a 
previously little-used mechanism for the widespread distribution of a drug for 
"compassionate use" after it has demonstrated its safety and effectiveness, but 
before it is approved for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that AIDS gave a national understanding for these reforms," Young 
said. "It provided an imperative that enabled us to focus on these issues. And 
it helped me convince the nation that it was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Compassionate Use' 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks, the FDA is expected to use its "compassionate use" mechanism to 
approve the widespread use of DDI, a new anti-viral AIDS drug, at the same time 
formal clinical trials to measure its effectiveness are scheduled to start. The 
FDA is considering making the new drug available to AIDS patients who cannot 
tolerate AZT, the only anti-viral AIDS drug thus far approved for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate departure, a panel appointed by President Bush has been 
discussing these very same issues, all with the same end in mind: how to speed 
access of promising drugs to people who would otherwise face death. 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS put a magnifying glass to everything, in terms of all life-threatening 
issues," says Broder of the National Cancer Institute. "AIDS reminded everybody 
that the things we are trying to do touch on people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cancer Drug Battles 
</P>
<P>
Broder remembers having frequent battles with the FDA in the 1970s over making 
experimental drugs available to cancer patients. The drug cis-platinum, for 
example, which Broder called "one of the most important anti-cancer agents ever 
discovered," was the object of numerous "delays and unnecessary bureaucratic 
roadblocks" at the FDA, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear to everyone in the oncology community that this drug was going to 
be a major advance," Broder said. "But there was an unwarranted and unrealistic 
preoccupation (at the FDA) with its side effects, without equal consideration 
of the good it could do. And that was being used to hold back a drug that had 
enormous value." 
</P>
<P>
Today, by contrast, Broder said, the FDA is much more willing to release cancer 
drugs earlier. About two months ago, he said, the cancer institute asked the 
FDA for the "compassionate use" release of levamisole, a drug that showed 
promise in treating early colon cancer. "It was approved with the speed of 
light, in about one day," Broder said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
This new attitude marks an important shift among regulators from the posture 
that had prevailed since the thalidomide scare in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Thalidomide, a sedative that caused serious limb abnormalities and other 
defects in babies born to women who had taken it while pregnant, was widely 
used in Europe in the 1960s. But in the United States, cautious regulators at 
the FDA held up approval of the drug for public sale when they found the 
scientific studies of its safety to be suspect. 
</P>
<P>
They were proved right, and, as Rothman said, "the FDA that emerged . . . was 
an FDA that was charged to put safety first, to minimize risk and to enhance 
the protection of the consumer." The specter of a thalidomide disaster in this 
country has guided federal regulators ever since -- until AIDS came along. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the nightmare case is no longer thalidomide," Rothman said. "It is that of 
a young man dying of a fatal disease in a painful, wasting and ultimately 
tragic fashion. Once that becomes the nightmare image, you make a very 
different calculus of risk and benefit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extraordinary Meeting 
</P>
<P>
This image clearly moved top FDA and NIH officials, particularly during that 
extraordinary encounter last February between Fauci and the activists. 
</P>
<P>
Fauci vividly remembers that meeting. The activists were demanding access to 
ganciclovir, a drug that had shown promise of preventing AIDS patients from 
going blind. Fauci found the protesters to be extremely responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always stated that I understood and appreciated their frustration, but 
I'd never seen any constructive criticisms, only lashing out in anger," Fauci 
said. "Then I began reading some of the documents written by the ACT UP people. 
They were surprisingly articulate and well-informed." 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the protesters, Fauci talked with the FDA's Young. His 
intervention helped speed the FDA's decision to release ganciclovir. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Network of Activists 
</P>
<P>
Rothman doubts that such a radical shift in regulatory approach could have been 
achieved by cancer patients or any group suffering from any other terminal 
illness. Most AIDS activists, he said, are already part of a large political 
base through the gay rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no network of cancer patients," Rothman said. "They are united only 
by their disease. With AIDS, you have a community already united. This is the 
first time you've got an organization in medicine lobbying this way on a 
disease in which the organization preceded the disease." 
</P>
<P>
Before AIDS, experimental drugs -- even for invariably fatal diseases -- were 
available to the public only through limited and highly structured clinical 
trials that compared their effects to those of medically inactive placebos or 
other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
These studies often took years to complete and many patients could not 
participate because they did not qualify or have access to them. Only after 
these painstaking studies established a drug as both safe and effective could 
other people take it. 
</P>
<P>
Many regulators and researchers had long argued that such lengthy scrutiny was 
necessary to achieve scientific certainty and to ensure that dangerous or 
worthless drugs did not proliferate. 
</P>
<P>
Now federal regulators have begun to relax the process. A new, federally 
sponsored program of community-based research efforts will allow local 
physicians and facilities to participate at the grass-roots level in various 
aspects of AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parallel Track Research 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, in the most controversial of the innovations now under way, Fauci 
has proposed a parallel research track that would allow new and unproved drugs 
to be used by AIDS patients even while traditional clinical trials were going 
ahead. The only persons allowed to take such drugs on the "parallel track" 
would be those ineligible for the formal, highly structured clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS activists and others believe that parallel track drug trials ultimately 
will prove effective in the fight against such diseases as cancer, advanced 
heart disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other major 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an issue about AIDS, but in the testing of all drugs for 
life-threatening illnesses," said Tom Stoddard, executive director of the 
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a national gay rights organization. 
"Ultimately, all Americans will benefit from this new approach to drug 
testing." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, said 
that a different standard should apply to the treatment of fatal diseases. The 
parallel track, he said, should provide "a good opportunity for a major 
rethinking of the purpose of the drug approval 
</P>
<P>
process in this country -- which should be, first and foremost, to approve 
drugs for diseases where someone is otherwise going to die or suffer severe 
impairment of health." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe, for years a vocal critic of the FDA, predicted that the parallel track, 
if it works for AIDS, "will be useful in other equally life-threatening 
circumstances -- the only circumstances where you should be willing to take 
such risks, when you're really up against the wall." 
</P>
<P>
But some researchers fear that the parallel track, the most radical departure 
from past practice, goes too far. 
</P>
<P>
Early access to experimental drugs, they warn, could subject individuals to 
additional suffering and even divert them from potentially more beneficial 
treatment -- chemotherapy and radiation for cancer, for example. And with the 
drug AZT showing promise, even AIDS patients might be taking a bad risk by 
trying unproven alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The skeptics cite the example of Laetrile, a drug that lured many cancer 
patients to Mexico and elsewhere when the FDA refused to make it available in 
the United States. The drug, a derivative of apricot pits, ultimately proved 
worthless. 
</P>
<P>
"If they give away the store, we can all worry," said an academic physician and 
longtime adviser to the FDA, who asked not to be identified. "If we loosen this 
up too much, then we'll be like some parts of the rest of the world, where drug 
regulation varies between less rigorous than desirable and abysmal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety, Efficacy Judgments 
</P>
<P>
The FDA's Young and others insist that, even under parallel track, drugs will 
not be released uncontrollably. They must be shown to be relatively safe and 
indicate at least some early evidence of efficacy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to just cavalierly experiment on people just because they're 
desperately ill," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you have to worry about quack remedies," added Petricciani of 
the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn. "You will still have FDA in the loop 
making judgments about safety and efficacy. I don't think there will be room 
for mischief." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is so sanguine. A former FDA adviser and longtime observer of the 
drug-approval process said that many drugs have been approved for sale to the 
public in recent years, only to be shown later to cause serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
Oraflex, which was widely hailed at the outset as an arthritis medication that 
was better than aspirin with fewer side effects, was approved by the FDA in 
1982. It was later removed from the market after its use was associated with at 
least 49 deaths in this country and several hundred deaths abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's with the most careful regulation," the former FDA adviser said. 
"Once you move away from that, the likelihood of more moves way up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Reservations 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers who are conducting controlled clinical AIDS trials favor the 
parallel track in theory but have serious reservations about whether it will 
work in practice. They fear that if the parallel track experiments are not 
carefully monitored, the results could be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
They point to several recent instances in which promising AIDS drugs have 
appeared safe in early human testing but proved more toxic after being given to 
larger numbers of people. They are also concerned about potential problems 
caused by drug interactions. 
</P>
<P>
"We can argue very strongly that if a drug looks safe and can be given in a 
safe setting, the drug should be offered to patients with AIDS as early as 
possible," said Harvard's Schooley. "But if these drugs are administered by 
people who aren't experienced in looking for unexpected side effects, we're 
likely to cause more harm to people who could otherwise be taking drugs we know 
a lot more about, like AZT." 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers also worry that parallel track may jeopardize traditional 
clinical trials for AIDS drugs because individuals will simply refuse to 
participate. Or potential participants may find some way of becoming ineligible 
for the formal trial because they want the certainty of receiving the 
experimental drug. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Instrument of Compassion' 
</P>
<P>
The cancer institute's Broder called the parallel track "an instrument of 
compassion" that is "designed to meet human needs." What it is not, he warned, 
is "a scientific instrument (or) a way of doing a clinical trial." 
</P>
<P>
Its purpose, he said, is "to not leave people totally out on a limb without 
anything, and to make sure patients do not feel disenfranchised and isolated. 
Those are legitimate goals, and I support them. But parallel track cannot be 
used as a substitute for clinical trials or as a vehicle for advancing the more 
rapid development of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Fauci acknowledged that there may be problems but declared that "many important 
and good ideas have met resistance early on. We have to have flexibility in 
allowing people who have no alternative. This is an important new approach. 
Let's worry about the problems as they arise. You can't abort the whole process 
because of potential problems." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their worries about the immediate impact of the parallel track on 
current or planned AIDS clinical trials, most researchers are confident that, 
in general, the future of controlled clinical trials is safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Aid Clinical Trials 
</P>
<P>
"If parallel track works in AIDS, there will be pressure from people with other 
severe chronic illness to have similar access to drugs," said Schooley. "But I 
don't think this will deliver a blow to clinical trials. . . . In a clinical 
trial, you're talking about more than just access to drugs. You're also talking 
about free access to the best specialists in the area and everything that goes 
with it. I don't think clinical trials will ever dry up. This might even make 
them better." 
</P>
<P>
Groopman of New England Deaconess Hospital said that he believes "a middle 
position ultimately will prevail" in drug regulation that "will benefit both 
patients and the research establishment." 
</P>
<P>
"This is how change occurs," Groopman said. "The more radical elements trigger 
it, and then the more liberal and central elements put it into real practice."

'COMPLETELY DIFFERENT' EVOLUTION IDEA; 
</P>
<P>
SUPER ICE AGE GAVE LIFE ON EARTH GROWING PAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Life on Earth had an easy birth, but a difficult childhood. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have recently painted a startling new picture of the Earth's early 
history, which, among other things, suggests that our planet once suffered 
through a super ice age from which it almost did not recover. 
</P>
<P>
The new scenario fills an evolutionary gap that has puzzled researchers for 
decades. According to one researcher, our previous conception of the early 
history of Earth "has been stood on its head." 
</P>
<P>
The discoveries are also helping scientists understand why it took more than 2 
billion years for complex plants and animals to appear on the Earth, and why 
their appearance in the fossil record is so abrupt. And the new information is 
helping scientists appreciate the crucial role of carbon dioxide in regulating 
the Earth's climate. 
</P>
<P>
This newly emerging picture is providing more and better information about the 
development of the global environment, especially at the crucial point in time 
when the atmosphere was changing from anaerobic, which could not support human 
life, to aerobic, which could. 
</P>
<P>
Because the conditions at that time were unique, such a scenario is unlikely to 
occur on Earth again, but the information learned about that period will help 
researchers determine if life could have developed on other planets and in 
other solar systems, and how it might have evolved. 
</P>
<P>
What researchers have learned is that, a little more than a billion years ago, 
the Earth's oceans were teeming with microscopic life -- blue-green algae, 
phytoplankton, cyanobacteria and thousands of other single-celled species, the 
product of 2.5 billion years of slow evolution. 
</P>
<P>
These microorganisms were proliferating so rapidly that they used up most of 
the carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere, allowing the life-giving warmth 
normally trapped by atmospheric carbon dioxide to radiate into space -- the 
opposite of the greenhouse effect that climatologists now fear is warming the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glaciers at Equator 
</P>
<P>
Within 400 million years, the globe had cooled to the point where glaciers 
covered the Equator at sea level, and as many as two-thirds of all the species 
on the planet had been snuffed out by cold. This "snowball Earth," researchers 
say, came perilously close to being forever entombed in ice, and was rescued 
only by the release of more carbon dioxide from the Earth's mantle by 
volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
That super ice age was much longer and much colder and had greater impact on 
living organisms than normal ice ages. Normal ice ages, which are caused by 
natural variations in the Earth's orbit, persist about 100,000 years, with 
10,000- to 20,000-year intervals of warmth between them. The super ice age was 
superimposed on top of this normal pattern of ice ages and lasted for tens of 
millions of years. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the world's ecological system collapsed slowly," paleobiologist 
J. William Schopf of UCLA said. "That sort of thing has never been observed 
anytime before or since. It's completely different from the sort of extinctions 
one thinks about in the rest of the geological record." 
</P>
<P>
But the Earth made a miraculous recovery and, as the planet slowly warmed, new 
forms of life began to appear -- multicelled organisms with hard shells or 
internal bone structures unlike anything that preceded them in the fossil 
record. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, geologist Joseph Kirschvink of Caltech said, the slow creep of 
glaciers to the Equator had the effect of "scraping off the planet down to the 
bone, so that life suddenly had a new environment to inhabit." And once those 
new environmental niches were established, life proliferated and evolved 
rapidly, progressing from simple multicelled organisms all the way to humans in 
only 600 million years, less than 15% of the Earth's history. 
</P>
<P>
The result of this remarkable picture of the Earth's adolescence, geochemist 
John M. Hayes of Indiana University said, is that "our approach to the Earth's 
history has been stood on its head." Where researchers once thought that levels 
of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere had changed only slowly and by 
only small amounts, he said, the new evidence has suggested much greater 
changes, accompanied by large changes in the nature of life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting times," Hayes said of the current research. "There are really 
fundamental ideas being changed and concepts being developed that are of the 
first magnitude in terms of their significance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10-Country Research Project 
</P>
<P>
The new discoveries came from an unusual collaboration of more than 50 
researchers from 10 countries. They have been drawn together for the past five 
years in an unprecedented research project under the aegis of Schopf, head of 
UCLA's Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life. 
</P>
<P>
The group, called the Precambrian Paleobiologic Research Group -- Proterozoic, 
or PPRG -- P, has carried out an extensive series of biological and geological 
field trips and collected more than 1,800 rock specimens for laboratory 
analysis -- an unprecedented number of specimens for this period of history. 
</P>

The Precambrian Era, the period from the Earth's formation about 4.5 billion 
years ago until roughly 570 million years ago, has long been a source of 
puzzlement because the fossil record -- the mineralized remains of plants and 
animals -- appeared to begin abruptly roughly 570 million years ago. The oldest 
fossils that had been discovered, until about 40 years ago, were of trilobites, 
hard-shelled, segmented forerunners of modern insects, spiders and crabs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, however, the late Stanley Tyler of the University of Wisconsin 
and Elso S. Barghoorn of Harvard University showed that unusual microscopic 
structures found in quartzite rock from the northern shores of Lake Superior 
were actually fossils of algae dating from 2.1 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Schopf and others have found still older fossils, the most 
ancient being 3.5-billion-year-old fossils of slimy green bacteria that 
colonized muddy ponds in western Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their great age, the fossils Schopf discovered were not as simple as 
might have been expected. In fact, they formed filaments and colonies that did 
not seem much different from those formed by similar algae and bacteria today. 
Schopf and others concluded that life must have begun fairly soon after the 
Earth was formed, perhaps within the first half-billion years, for evolution to 
have progressed that far. 
</P>
<P>
But in solving one mystery, Schopf had created another. If life could begin and 
evolve into sophisticated bacteria so easily in the first few hundred million 
years of the planet's history, why were another 2 billion years required before 
the first multicelled organisms appeared? 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a vast amount of time," said micropaleontologist Carl V. 
Mendolson of Beloit College in Beloit, Wis. "We're trying to read this book of 
life based on very few pages." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the work of the PPRG-P, though, researchers are beginning to pull 
together the first comprehensive picture of what the Earth must have been like 
during the Proterozoic Period, that portion of the Precambrian Era ranging from 
2.5 billion years ago up to 570 million years ago. And that picture "strains 
some of the evolutionary scenarios that have been widely accepted," 
geophysicist J. John Sepkoski Jr. of the University of Chicago said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accelerated Pace 
</P>
<P>
Paleontologists have long believed that the Proterozoic was characterized by 
continuous and slow evolution, a process that led naturally to the evolution of 
the complex, multicellular species. But the new evidence indicates, Sepkoski 
said, "that is not at all correct. Early on in the Earth's history, a 
reasonably stable (biological) community was put together and it really didn't 
change through the Proterozoic." 
</P>
<P>
Only when the climate underwent a near-catastrophic upheaval at the end of the 
Proterozoic did the evolutionary pace begin to accelerate again. "There wasn't 
an evolutionary march toward greater and greater complexity, toward modernity, 
but a record of jumps and starts," Sepkoski said. 
</P>
<P>
The key evidence supporting this new scenario of the Earth's evolution lay in 
the residual magnetism of 1-billion-year-old rocks studied by George E. 
Williams of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization 
and Brian J. J. Embleton of Macquarie University, both in North Ryde, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
That magnetism indicates that Australia was on the Equator a billion years ago. 
Evidence from sediments formed at that time also indicates the continent was 
covered by glaciers. If Australia, on the Equator, was covered by glaciers, 
then the whole world must have been, because the ice would have spread from the 
poles. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the glaciers form? Scientists blame the loss of carbon dioxide from the 
Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carbon Not Released 
</P>
<P>
About 1 billion years ago, the Earth's oceans were filled with microscopic life 
that extracted carbon dioxide from the air and converted it into sugar 
molecules that became part of their cellular structures. 
</P>
<P>
As they died naturally, the microorganisms drifted to the bottom of seas and 
were buried in sediments, so that the carbon they contained could not be 
released back into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Today this process is comparatively rare because the bulk of the microorganisms 
are eaten by animals and their carbon recycled through the food chain. Most 
researchers agree that the circumstances that caused global glaciation were 
unique and that the event could not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
"Organic carbon was being buried at rates as high as anything we've seen in the 
last billion years," said Andrew Knoll of Harvard, whose study of sediments has 
been crucial in documenting the changes in carbon dioxide levels. 
</P>
<P>
As new generations of microorganisms removed more and more carbon dioxide from 
the atmosphere, temperatures slowly grew colder and glaciers crept toward the 
Equator from both poles, eventually enveloping the whole planet. 
</P>
<P>
As the climate cooled, whole species began dying off, Schopf said. According to 
the fossil record, he added, "at least half, maybe two-thirds of the things 
that were alive didn't make it after about 600 million years ago." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Life Died 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that saved the Earth from completely freezing over, apparently, 
was the fact that most life had died off. Living organisms were therefore no 
longer removing much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and the carbon dioxide 
released by volcanoes began accumulating, gradually warming the planet. 
</P>
<P>
In a remarkable coincidence, researchers said, at just about this time oxygen 
began accumulating in the atmosphere. Living organisms thus confronted an 
ecology that had been stripped of most of the previous life forms and had an 
abundance of oxygen to meet their needs. 
</P>
<P>
Climatologists know that the first fossils of multicellular animals are found 
in sediments lying immediately above those deposited during the glacial period 
-- and they are found all over the world. "Some external event triggered the 
ability of organisms to mineralize and grow larger . . . and one very good 
possibility is the oxygenation of the atmosphere," biologist Bruce Runnegar of 
UCLA said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of all the tectonic, atmospheric and environmental shifts, said Knoll, 
"we have to conclude that the world changed in a fairly fundamental way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Super Ice Age 
</P>
<P>
Earth was in danger of becoming totally encased in ice forever 
</P>
<P>
Researchers trying to solve they mystrey of why complex creatures suddenly 
appeared on the Earthsome 570 million years ago have pieced together a 
stratling new picture of an Earth that almost became a massive ball of ice. As 
carbon dioxide was removed from the atmosphere by natural processes, the Earth 
grew colder until glaciers covered even the equator. As many as two-thirds of 
all species were killed off in the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earth 
</P>
<P>
800 million years ago 
</P>
<P>
Earth's land masses were concentrated into two large supercontinents, centered 
on the equator. When the amount of carbon dioxide in the air reached its lowest 
level, Earth was encased in ice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earth 
</P>
<P>
600 million years ago to now 
</P>
<P>
The extinction of so many species, combined with growing concentrations of 
oxygen in the air, allowed new forms of organisms to appear and begin to spread 
over the planet in a new stage in theevolution of life on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life 
</P>
<P>
3 billion to 800 million years ago 
</P>
<P>
Life in the oceans consisted of large groups of one-celled micoorganisms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oceans 
</P>
<P>
z3 billion to 800 million years ago 
</P>
<P>
One-celled organisms proliferated, converting carbon dioxide into cellular 
materials. As they died, they sank to the bottom and were buried. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glaciers 
</P>
<P>
1 billion to 800 million years ago 
</P>
<P>
As carbon dioxide was removed from the atmosphere, the Earth got colder and 
glaciers at the poles began to expand and move toward the Equator. Over time 
the glaciers ended up covering almostthe entire planet including the oceans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volcanoes 
</P>
<P>
800 million to 600 million years ago 
</P>
<P>
Earth was saved from a permanent deep freeze when volcanoes erupted and 
released carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus began a process to replace 
the carbon dioxide taken out by one-celledorganisms.

A man who had been following actress Justine Bateman, former star of the 
television series "Family Ties," was taken into custody Wednesday after he 
threatened suicide outside a theater in Berkeley where she was scheduled to 
perform, police said. Police persuaded John Thomas Smetek, 39, of Houston, 
Tex., to surrender the loaded revolver he held to his abdomen as he sat in the 
courtyard of the Berkeley Repertory Theater, Berkeley Police Lt. Robert Peters 
said. Bateman, 23, was not at the theater at the time. Smetek, who will undergo 
a psychiatric evaluation at Highland Hospital, had been trailing Bateman for 
months, Peters said. Smetek was arrested for investigation of possession of a 
loaded firearm within city limits and two felony counts of displaying a 
firearm. Bateman and theater officials declined to press charges and Smetek was 
released, the officer said.

The former prime minister of Soviet Uzbekistan was sentenced to nine years in a 
labor camp in the latest twist to a corruption scandal that reached into the 
Kremlin. The official Tass news agency said that Normankhanmadi Khudayberdyev, 
prime minister of the Central Asian republic from 1971 to 1984, was found 
guilty of giving $78,000 in bribes to Yuri M. Churbanov, son-in-law of late 
Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. Churbanov, a former deputy interior minister, 
was given a 12-year term in December for taking bribes. Khudayberdyev was also 
found guilty of taking $25,000 in bribes from his subordinates. More than 100 
Communist Party and government officials have been implicated in the corruption 
probe, which began in Uzbekistan in 1983.

Israeli troops shot and wounded 21 Palestinians during clashes in the occupied 
Gaza Strip, hospital and U.N. relief officials said. Fifteen of them were 
wounded, none seriously, during clashes that broke out when masked youths 
stoned an army patrol, hospital officials said. U.N. refugee workers complained 
to the army that soldiers stopped their ambulance and arrested two wounded 
Palestinians on their way to hospital. An army spokesman said troops shot and 
wounded two youths in the occupied West Bank but that he had no reports of 
injuries or arrests in the Gaza Strip.

Afghanistan and Pakistan traded accusations about prolonging the Afghan civil 
war as nonaligned diplomats worked on a series of bland statements to paper 
over their differences on regional conflicts. The dispute between the two 
nations came at the summit of the 102-nation Nonaligned Movement in Belgrade, 
Yugoslavia. Pakistan was angered by a speech in which Afghan President 
Najibullah accused Islamabad of waging war against his government by supplying 
arms to rebel groups.

State agriculture officials have completed ground spraying of the pesticide 
malathion in northern Santa Clara County and announced plans for an aerial 
spray to battle an infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies. Gov. George 
Deukmejian told agriculture officials that he will declare a state of emergency 
in Santa Clara County, agriculture department officials said. The emergency 
declaration allows authorities to spray malathion without issuing an 
environmental impact report that could take months to prepare, Curry said. The 
state will also release 30 million sterile Medflies a week until biologists 
decide that the infestation has been curtailed.

The White House Office of Management and Budget was blamed for the inability of 
government statisticians to track significant changes in the economy and their 
effect on people and businesses, even while spending some $2 billion this year 
trying. While the skills of workers are increasingly recognized as key to 
economic growth and improving the nation's competitiveness, the government 
spends nearly seven times more collecting data on agriculture than education, 
said the congressional Office of Technology Assessment. The report cited cuts 
in the budgets of most agencies for collecting and analyzing data during the 
last eight years and a resistance by OMB officials to allow new surveys sought 
by statisticians.

The Soviet Union, bowing to demands of local residents, has abandoned plans to 
complete a plant to dispose of chemical weapons at Chapayevsk on the Volga 
River, Tass reported. In a sign of an increasing willingness by authorities to 
listen to growing environmental concerns, the official Soviet news agency said 
that a government commission has agreed to suspend construction of what it 
called a "dangerous enterprise." Moscow, now negotiating a treaty with 
Washington to ban chemical weapons, had intended to start using the plant later 
this year. It was not clear from the Tass report if an alternative would be 
found. Tass said people in the region where the plant was being built -- about 
500 miles southeast of Moscow -- had protested its construction for a year.

East German diplomats set up an office near a refugee camp Wednesday to try to 
persuade thousands of their countrymen to give up dreams of a new life in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
By late Wednesday, about 5,600 East Germans hoping to flee to West Germany via 
Hungary and then Austria had registered to do so, officials of West German 
charities said. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian charity officials said a sixth refugee camp has opened. 
</P>
<P>
At the Zugliget refugee camp in Budapest, First Secretary Dieter Grahmann of 
the East German Embassy began distributing leaflets Tuesday promising the 
refugees that no harm would come to them if they returned home. He left quickly 
after an angry crowd gathered. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, he returned with a colleague and set up for business in a trailer 
across from the camp. Small groups gathered near the trailer shortly after it 
was manned at 9:45 a.m., but no one went inside. 
</P>
<P>
"They must really be stupid to come here," said a refugee from Dresden. "But I 
guess they have no choice -- it's either victory or Siberia for them." 
</P>
<P>
Grahmann told reporters the refugees are free "to discuss the situation" with 
him or a colleague. The East German Embassy said the trailer will reopen today. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Red Cross officials at nearby Csilleberc camp said an East German 
diplomat carrying leaflets was barred from entry because "it would have been 
difficult to guarantee (his) safety," the official MTI news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 30 East Germans, apparently frustrated at waiting for a promised 
freedom convoy from Hungary to the West, fled illegally Tuesday night to 
Austria, Red Cross officials there said. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Hungary partially cleared barbed wire and other barriers from its 
border with Austria, an action that helped spark the current exodus of East 
Germans into Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials, who had seemed optimistic last week that a mass transit 
westward could begin in days, now are more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, where West German officials have been negotiating with Communist East 
German leaders over the refugee standoff, government speaker Hans Klein said 
East Germany showed no flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
However, in East Berlin on Wednesday, the official ADN news agency blamed Bonn 
for the lack of progress in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 East Germans have fled through Hungary and Austria to West 
Germany since Hungary began clearing its westernmost border in May.

Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski has fired several hard-line generals who 
opposed reforms that led to the nomination of Prime Minister Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki, a Communist Party source said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski, who also is commander in chief of the armed forces, late Monday 
named new, younger officers to head Poland's three military districts: 
Pomerania, Silesia and Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
He also made five other promotions, including Gen. Jerzy Gotowala as commander 
of the air force, in what the official news agency PAP called "a rejuvenation 
of key posts in the armed forces." Gotowala, 48, replaced Gen. Tytus Krwawczyc, 
59. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said that despite the changes, they are surprised that 
Jaruzelski still has not ousted his top remaining hard-liner, Defense Minister 
Florian Siwicki. 
</P>

guys were not keeping up with the political changes," one Communist Party

Involved in Restructuring

A key promotion was that of Brig. Gen. Franciczek Puchala as deputy chief of 
the army general staff. Considered a reformer, Puchala has been involved in the 
restructuring of the Polish military forces.

On the eve of his confirmation by the Parliament last month as Poland's first 
non-Communist prime minister since World War II, Mazowiecki said Jaruzelski has 
assured him of support from the army and police, which are the traditional 
power base of the Communists.

PRESIDENT LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TO WIN SUPPORT FOR DRUG WAR STRATEGY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
From the nursery of an inner city hospital where drug-addicted mothers have 
abandoned their babies, to the more conventional setting of a government 
auditorium, President Bush embarked Wednesday on an exhaustive campaign to sell 
his new drug war strategy to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm challenging the Congress to give us bipartisan support in the 
implementation of this strategy and I'm looking to the grass-roots support of 
America's communities in the fight against drugs," the President told 50 police 
reporters and editors summoned to the White House from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
With attention in Washington suddenly riveted on the flow of drugs into the 
nation's cities, suburbs and even its rural hamlets, a spate of competing 
proposals were debated and congressional Democrats worked to prevent an 
outpouring of popular support from closing out their options on drug strategy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democrats Say Plan Falls Short 
</P>
<P>
"We need real resources and real results and I don't believe the President's 
plan goes far enough to produce them," said House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), once a U.S. attorney in 
Maine, said: "What we must do now is meet the public demand for effective and 
prompt action. And that means putting our resources where our rhetoric is." 
</P>
<P>
The $7.9-billion plan represents a $2.2-billion increase over last year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite complaints that the Bush plan offered "too little, too late," Vice 
President Dan Quayle, in a luncheon with editors and reporters in The Times' 
Washington Bureau, predicted that "in due course the Congress will buy most of 
the President's program." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush proposal is built around increased law enforcement, intensified 
efforts at halting the entry of drugs into the United States, drug treatment, 
and education about the dangers of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aid for 'Crack Babies' Proposed 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Senate, Republicans proposed banning congressional junk mail 
and using the $45 million it costs for treatment of "crack babies" born to 
addicted mothers. The measure, sponsored by Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), was a 
response to criticism that the President had not proposed sufficient spending 
to win the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that it would help treat 400,000 infants, or more than 10% of all 
live births, by halting mass mailings by members of Congress in the year 
starting Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The President's plan to focus his public attention and his travel almost 
exclusively in coming days on issues related to drug abuse, sets a course that 
offers few likely pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
"The President chose a safe issue to put his mark on," said Stuart E. 
Eizenstat, White House domestic policy chief during the Jimmy Carter 
Administration. "He preempted a major domestic issue with a rather conventional 
program but one that will satisfy the average American that something is being 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Schneiders, a Democratic political consultant and pollster, said: "I'm not 
sure this particular issue is looked at the same way by voters as the economy 
and crises in foreign policy. The whole drug thing, people understand, is 
pervasive and doesn't readily lend itself to federal solutions." 
</P>
<P>
So, he said, "I don't think Bush will be credited if the problem goes away, or 
blamed if it doesn't. He's in a bit of a no-lose situation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
President Tours Nurseries 
</P>
<P>
Barely 12 hours after he unveiled his anti-drug program, Bush visited the 
nurseries of the D.C. General Hospital. A television set broadcast the theme 
song of a sitcom rerun, babies wailed or greeted him with blank stares and 
officials told him that 20% of their patients are born to mothers who have 
abused cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Looking in on one infant who had tested positive for the AIDS antibodies, the 
President asked: "Does that baby have a chance to get well?" 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know," said one of his guides, Dr. Stanley Sinkford, chairman of the 
hospital's pediatrics department. 
</P>
<P>
The virus is often transmitted through the sharing of unsterilized hypodermic 
needles by intravenous drug abusers. Many infected women pass the virus to 
unborn children during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the President said at the news conference: 
</P>
<P>
"You really want to have a broken heart and feel something in your heart, go 
and see these little kids, some of whom are abandoned, some of whom are, or 
many of whom are born from, given birth to by mothers who are addicted to 
cocaine. And we've got to help in that area, and I believe we can do a job 
there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors Asked for Help 
</P>
<P>
The President also appealed for support among a group of foreign ambassadors 
invited to the White House complex, telling them that "only through a broad, 
cooperative international effort can we reduce the foreign drug supply to our 
nation and to countries around the globe." 
</P>
<P>
"So this really is a war that the United States cannot fight alone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But one Latin American diplomat said afterward that the President's proposal 
failed to address "the need to block export of weapons from U.S. and other 
industrialized countries to drug-exporting countries," and that it failed to 
focus attention on "synthetic drugs," among them LSD and amphetamines, produced 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spending Levels Defended 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day -- at the hospital and back at the White House -- Bush found 
himself in a traveling debate of sorts with his critics, defending the spending 
level of $7.9 billion -- an increase of $717 million over his original 
anti-drug budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 -- and insisting that 
additional spending, funded through higher taxes, is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been little, if any, substantive criticism about this national 
strategy," he maintained in the news conference with reporters and editors who 
specialize on crime issues. 
</P>
<P>
To the suggestion that greater taxes might be needed to provide more money for 
the anti-drug effort, Bush said: "I don't believe we have a drug problem 
because we aren't paying enough in taxes." 
</P>
<P>
He dismissed his critics for "carping those partisan comments." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congressional Critics Speak Up 
</P>
<P>
Among the critics was Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who said the Bush plan 
"falls dramatically short" in the areas of treatment and education. Kennedy 
would pay for it by eliminating two of 132 Stealth bombers to save $1 billion 
and get the rest from cuts in the Strategic Defense Initiative program to 
develop a ballistic missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
complained that states and cities will have to put up substantially more funds 
for police, drug testing and prisons than they would receive in federal aid to 
combat drugs. "We've got to do a lot more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D-Mass.) said Bush should have allocated more funds 
for interdiction of drugs entering the United States, since the Coast Guard, 
Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service are all 
"woefully undermanned" to deal with a $150-billion cocaine racket.

MAYORS, POLICE CRITICIZE LOW FUNDING LEVEL IN DRUG PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In declaring war against drugs without vastly increasing the federal budget, 
President Bush is hoping that a relatively small increase in federal funds can 
leverage a much greater response from state and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, his idea already was meeting with substantial skepticism from 
mayors and police chiefs who will be called upon to see that most of the actual 
fighting on the cities' streets is carried out. 
</P>
<P>
They contend the extra $200 million the President proposes to give state and 
local governments for more law enforcement results is a mere 800 police 
officers in a nation that has 83,000 units of local government. Administration 
officials argue that such criticism misses the point. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's hope is that the new dose of federal funds can stimulate 
innovative programs at the local level -- everything from better ways to 
conduct "sting" operations to boot camps for teen-age drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needs Local Support 
</P>
<P>
Without a strong local response, the plan easily could suffer the fate of past 
White House anti-crime and anti-drug campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've learned," said Charles Work, a top official in the defunct Law 
Enforcement Assistance Administration, ". . . that you just can't dump money 
out there" and get solutions. 
</P>
<P>
But while money may not be enough all by itself, Bush's critics argue that more 
funds are, nonetheless, needed. The mixed reaction the plan has gotten so far 
from state and local officials illustrates the difficulty Bush faces. The 
President and his aides believe they can combat drugs through federal 
coordination and inspiration. But many officials at the local level, where the 
bulk of the actual drug fighting goes on, would prefer cash. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get less than $30 million from this," New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said 
in a radio interview Wednesday. "We're not ungrateful," he added, but in the 
context of $6 billion already being spent by the state and its cities, "that 
doesn't mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire, president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, 
called the plan "only a first step." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes Condition 
</P>
<P>
And Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), the Democrats' leading spokesman on drug 
issues, noted that as a condition for getting the funds, Bush wants to require 
local government to take a series of steps that would overwhelm the new federal 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's program calls on state and local officials to increase their police 
forces by 1%, Biden said, a step that would cost about $244 million nationwide. 
The plan also would require states to increase drug testing in their criminal 
justice systems, a step that would cost more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bush is hoping to fund his drug plan by reducing other programs, 
including housing and economic development programs, that provide substantial 
aid to cities. In the end, the National League of Cities estimates that large 
cities would be net losers of funds under Bush's plan, according to Frank 
Shafroth, the organization's federal relations director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Defend Plan 
</P>
<P>
Some law enforcement officials outside the Administration defended Bush's plan. 
Charles D. Reynolds, president of the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police 
said, for example, that "we keep hearing it is not enough. No one is able to 
answer what is enough, and I'm not sure whatever amount (of money) the 
President proposed would be enough. It's in the eye of the beholder." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's aides, similarly, dismiss much of the criticism as politically inspired. 
"No matter what amount of money this President -- any Republican President -- 
proposes for just about anything in this arena of social policy . . . (it) will 
not be enough," William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of 
National Drug Control Policy, said in a speech Wednesday. The criticisms, he 
said, are "less a product of reflection and more a product of reflex." 
</P>
<P>
The grant strategy that Bennett has devised for Bush is based on two decades of 
experience in channeling money to cities and states to stimulate crime fighting 
efforts on the local level. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Administration officials hope their plan will work where past 
efforts failed is the tight focus it places on drugs in contrast to past 
programs that, according to critics, wasted much of the federal money spent on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush plan "is very different than the scatter-gun approach" used in the 
past, said Clifford L. Karchmer, associate director of the Police Executive 
Research Forum, a Washington-based police law enforcement think tank. "This is 
much more focused." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follows Existing Pathway 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the money would flow through the Justice Department's existing 
grant-giving agency, the Bureau of Justice Assistance. Following the pathway 
that already exists in federal law, the money would not go directly to 
localities, but would go, instead, to state governments which, in turn, would 
distribute the funds to cities and towns. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the money, 70% of the total, would go to states under a formula 
based on population. The remaining 30% would be distributed at the discretion 
of the Justice Department in response to plans submitted by would-be 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
The plan already is raising hackles among mayors and their representatives in 
Washington, renewing an old turf fight between states and cities over who gets 
to control the flow of federal largess.

SATURATION REPORTAGE MAY AID BUSH POLITICALLY;

<P>
MEDIA GOING ALL-OUT ON DRUG COVERAGE

<P>
He gazed into the camera and spoke as earnestly as he could: 
</P>
<P>
"If this is a war," he said of the national drug crisis, "we're all soldiers. 
Not a war that can be won with more money alone, or just tougher laws, or 
better treatment . . . . This is a test of our national will." 
</P>
<P>
The speaker was not President Bush giving his first prime-time address on 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw signing off his broadcast a few hours before. 
</P>
<P>
The American news media have responded to the President's drug policy 
initiative, after a little prodding from the White House, with an extraordinary 
outpouring of coverage on the drug issue. 
</P>
<P>
Much of it, the White House believes, may work to the President's political 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drugs Make Cover Story 
</P>
<P>
Major newspapers, including this one, are filling whole pages with the subject. 
The major news weeklies all made drugs their cover stories. And, in an 
unprecedented move, all three major television networks are devoting most of an 
entire week's worth of news coverage to the drug issue. 
</P>
<P>
ABC calls its coverage "Drugs: A Plague Upon the Land." NBC's is "Drug Watch." 
CBS, which will do its part next week, calls it "Drugs: One Nation, Under 
Siege." 
</P>
<P>
Even ABC's weekend health and business programs will focus on drugs, as will 
each of the networks' morning, evening and weekend morning programs. 
</P>
<P>
And, although not all the coverage so far has echoed the President's message 
nearly as closely as Brokaw's Tuesday sign-off, White House officials believe 
that saturation air time serves the President's purpose and will help them sell 
to Congress a policy that is still controversial in its details. 
</P>
<P>
Although the coverage may quote critics, White House communications director 
David Demarest said, "the President is the only one with a plan. There may be 
people who want their program to have more funding . . . or across the board 
more money, but those kinds of comments are not a substitute for a strategy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Video Obscures Audio 
</P>
<P>
News executives disagree, even though they concede that predicting the effect 
of news coverage is often difficult. It is particularly hard to interpret the 
impact that television coverage has on viewers because the visual images 
generally overwhelm whatever spoken message the story might try to convey. 
</P>
<P>
"If the discussion of the exact programs and their possible shortcomings . . . 
is done on an honest basis," said Richard C. Wald, senior vice president of ABC 
News, "the Administration doesn't get a free pass." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some of the coverage has been rough. Follow-up stories Wednesday on 
"The Today Show," for instance, generally characterized the President's 
proposals as offering little change from the status quo, as did the analysis 
stories in The Times, the Washington Post and the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
But, on Wednesday night, each of the three networks devoted half of their news 
broadcasts to drugs, and, although everyone covered the critics of the plan, 
most of the coverage concentrated on the evils of the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever is right about the nature of coverage, the White House is getting the 
amount of coverage it wanted despite far less advance selling of its political 
initiative than usually characterized the Ronald Reagan White House. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Release Key Lines 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration did not even release key lines of the speech in advance 
for the Tuesday evening news, a regular technique of Reagan handlers to ensure 
additional coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of drugs, they didn't have to do a sell," NBC White House 
correspondent Jim Miklaszewski said. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of any other presidential agenda, and with the economy stable 
and the Soviet threat apparently diminishing, the drug issue stands out, Wald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And, with children returning to school and public opinion polls showing drugs 
as the No. 1 concern of Americans, White House officials privately say that 
they expected the media to respond with generous coverage. The only thing the 
White House deliberately did was announce three weeks ahead of time that Bush 
would give the speech, so that the networks would have time to plan other 
stories related to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Within a week, two networks obliged. "We think we have an obligation, once 
again, to try and portray to the American public the enormity of this drug 
threat," CBS News President David Burke said in announcing CBS's plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Reinforce Speech 
</P>
<P>
The White House has learned the lessons laid out by Reagan communications 
adviser Michael Deaver about reinforcing a speech's impact by following it up 
with major events staged for the media. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, for instance, seven Cabinet members gave roughly 50 interviews 
with local TV stations in key cities nationwide via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
The President also has a week's worth of follow-up events to reinforce his drug 
strategy in the public's mind, including Wednesday's supposedly spontaneous but 
thoroughly planned trip to a Washington hospital to visit children of drug 
abusers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he conducted a briefing for 70 local crime reporters invited to 
the White House. And he had briefings with law enforcement officials and drug 
treatment professionals, in advance of which the White House public relations 
staff contacted media from the officials' home areas. Also, the White House 
allows the local officials to be interviewed on the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Drug czar William J. Bennett also appeared on all three network morning 
programs Wednesday and delivered a speech to the National Press Club that was 
carried live on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
All this may make up for a speech that even some in the White House privately 
concede was disappointing, at least in presentation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inappropriate Smiles 
</P>
<P>
The President seemed to smile inappropriately during the speech, officials 
conceded privately, suggesting that he was unexpectedly nervous during the 
address. He had not been so during rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
Deaver used to estimate that 25% of the audience will tune out after the first 
five minutes of a presidential address, and, by that standard, some thought 
Bush should have packed more into the beginning of his speech. 
</P>
<P>
"If I would have been a casual observer, I wouldn't have been dragged into the 
tent by the first five (minutes)," Miklaszewski said. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier drafts of the speech, White House officials had included more 
anecdotes early in the speech. They removed them, in part for length, and hoped 
that Bush's lifting of the packet of crack cocaine would be sufficiently 
dramatic. Some worried Wednesday that it had not been. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, some early evidence suggests that, if the public is pleased that Bush is 
tackling the drug issue, the theatrics of his speech may be largely irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown University government professor Michael Robinson, who specializes in 
political media, watched the speech with 25 college students, who came away 
impressed, even though they disdained Bush's presentation and actually laughed 
when the President said that the plan would not require higher taxes or an 
increased federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Right Speech' at 'Right Time' 
</P>
<P>
They liked the speech for three reasons. First, a majority said "that this was 
the right speech at the right time about the right issue," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Second, they came away with the impression that Bush's proposal called for an 
$8-billion increase in spending to fight drugs, even though the actual amount 
of the increase is only about $1 billion, Robinson said, because the President 
kept repeating the $8-billion figure, which is the rough total amount to be 
spent. 
</P>
<P>
And third, "They regard George Bush as a so-so rhetorician and public speaker, 
but they disdained the notion that presentation really matters," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The students criticized Bush's use of graphics and anecdotes as too imitative 
of Reagan. And they thought picking up the crack bag, a trump card in the White 
House planning, seemed hokey. 
</P>
<P>
When one student in the group criticized Bush's speech overall because of his 
delivery, he was shouted down, Robinson said. Said one student defending the 
President: "He's not an anchorman, just President."

ANDEAN DRUG POLICY TO FOCUS ON SEIZING CROPS 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration, as part of its new offensive against drug producers, 
has decided to back away from efforts to eradicate coca fields in Peru and 
Bolivia and to escalate military campaigns to intercept the crops before they 
reach processing labs, Administration officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, recommended under a $2-billion "Andean initiative" contained in 
President Bush's anti-drug strategy, would seek to focus efforts in South 
America on powerful cocaine traffickers rather than impoverished peasants, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The escalation, previously rejected out of concern that such an approach could 
pose unacceptable risks, signals the urgency felt by an Administration 
determined to wage a comprehensive war on drugs even as it ventures into 
uncharted grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy is a tacit admission that eradication efforts had failed and 
marks the beginning of a new era in the American effort to staunch the supply 
of cocaine at its source -- a South American crackdown described by President 
Bush as an indication that "the rules have changed." 
</P>
<P>
The change in tactics would deploy military forces in the Andean countries as 
central players in the anti-cocaine effort. The South American troops would be 
bolstered by an influx of U.S. aid and extensive training by U.S. military 
advisers. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts warned that in waging such a drug war by proxy, the United States 
could put itself in the position of expensive but doubtful reliance on armies 
that have not yet demonstrated a full commitment to the task. 
</P>
<P>
"In theory, this makes far more sense than eradication," said Renssalaer Lee, 
an adjunct professor at American University. "But in practice, I'm skeptical 
that we'll end up any better off than we are now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Military Task 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, however, argued that the anti-drug effort in Peru, 
Bolivia and Colombia -- waged against well-armed cocaine cartels sometimes 
aligned with powerful guerrilla movements -- clearly had become more a military 
than a law enforcement task. 
</P>
<P>
The most vulnerable targets, they said, appeared to be the major "choke-points" 
-- airstrips, river routes and roads -- through which Peruvian and Bolivian 
coca is ferried on its way to processing plants in those countries and 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
A primary goal of the Andean initiative, they said, would be to use U.S.-backed 
military forces -- roadblocks, river patrols and actual military attacks -- to 
disrupt those key transport routes so severely that it would isolate the 
coca-growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose, they said, would be to depress the value of coca crops to the 
point that Peruvian and Bolivian growers might be willing to seriously consider 
replanting their fields with other crops. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding to give less emphasis to the eradication program, U.S. officials 
said, the Administration is moving away from an approach that had been "about 
as stable as a one-legged stool." 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the United States does not propose to dispense altogether 
with coca eradications, noting that the Administration has endorsed 
"eradication of the coca crop when it can be made an effective strategy." 
</P>
<P>
They made clear, however, that the new Andean initiative would shift priority 
of the military crackdown away from the coca fields. 
</P>
<P>
"With more selectivity in the eradication expeditions," said Terrence M. Burke, 
a deputy assistance administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, "that 
means more blade time for the helicopters in the interdiction process." 
</P>
<P>
Of $97.5 million in new aid slated for Bolivia and $73.3 million for Peru, the 
bulk would be in military aid, with much of the remainder in law enforcement 
funding, according to a funding breakdown released Wednesday. No economic 
assistance would be provided until the following year, when it would be offered 
as a reward for progress in the anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
An even larger share of a $90.4-million total package planned for Colombia 
would be composed of military assistance, with no plans for economic aid.

SMALL FARMERS LOSE LONG LEGAL BATTLE OVER UC AGRICULTURE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court, in what could mark the end of a decade-long legal 
battle, on Wednesday rejected an attempt to force the University of California 
to devote more agricultural research to the needs of small family farmers. 
</P>
<P>
The justices let stand an appellate ruling that struck down a heralded 1987 
trial court finding that federal law required the university and other 
land-grant institutions to give such farms "primary consideration" in devising 
agricultural research policies. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's action by the high court eliminated the remainder of what had been 
a sweeping challenge by lawyers for farmers, workers and consumers to UC's 
far-ranging, $116-million-a-year agricultural research program. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in 1978, charged that the university improperly favored large 
farmers, food processors, chemical companies and machinery manufacturers, and 
that UC officials were guilty of conflict of interest and unlawful expenditure 
of tax money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claim Detriment 
</P>
<P>
As an example, the suit cited the development at UC Davis of a mechanical 
tomato harvester the plaintiffs claimed was designed for farms of at least 150 
acres -- to the substantial detriment of smaller growers. 
</P>
<P>
But over the years, most of the plaintiffs' claims were dismissed or dropped 
from the suit, leaving only the question of whether provisions of the federal 
Hatch Act of 1887 required UC, as a recipient of federal funds, to give special 
attention to the needs of small farmers. 
</P>
<P>
William G. Hoerger of California Rural Legal Assistance, an attorney for the 
plaintiffs, said he was "greatly disappointed" with the justices' refusal to 
review the appellate ruling rejecting the suit. It was uncertain whether the 
case would be taken to the U.S. Supreme Court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoerger added, however, that he believed that the suit was "tremendously 
successful" in focusing attention on the UC research program -- and was at 
least partly responsible for new emphasis by the university on research that 
benefits small farmers. Among other things, the university has studied new 
pest-control methods requiring less reliance on expensive chemicals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10-Year Struggle 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, attorneys for the university welcomed the apparent end to 
the 10-year legal struggle and lamented what they said were thousands of hours 
wasted on defending against charges that had no merit. 
</P>
<P>
"This suit made very serious charges of conflict of interest and mismanagement 
and questioned the integrity of university research," said UC counsel Gary 
Morrison. "Over the years, all those charges fizzled away, leaving only a 
narrow question of interpretation of a statute. And now that issue has been 
resolved, completely vindicating the university." 
</P>
<P>
James C. Martin, an Oakland attorney representing the university, said 
Wednesday's action reflected the high court's recognition that "this case never 
belonged in the courts in the first place." Debate on research policy instead 
should be conducted within the university and by the Legislature, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Both lawyers said there was no basis for the claim that the lawsuit had 
resulted indirectly in any marked change in the university's agricultural 
research program. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 ruling at issue in the case was made by Alameda Superior Court Judge 
Raymond L. Marsh. The judge, citing what he said were the requirements of the 
Hatch Act, ordered the university to devise new policies -- subject to annual 
court review -- that bring greater benefits to small farmers, consumers and 
farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh's decision, hailed by farm activists, could have had far-reaching impact. 
While federal funding under the act accounts for less than 5% of the 
university's total research budget, those funds are spread among most of the 
more than 1,000 research projects under way at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appealed Ruling 
</P>
<P>
The university appealed Marsh's ruling, arguing that research projects were and 
should be chosen solely on scientific merit and that any court-ordered 
requirement to favor special groups would violate academic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, a state Court of Appeal in San Francisco upheld the university and 
struck down the decision, finding that there was nothing in the language of the 
act or in federal regulations explicitly requiring recipients of federal funds 
to place special emphasis on small-farm needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The judiciary is not the forum to debate national farm policy or to develop 
administrative procedures for enforcing the Hatch Act," Appellate Justice Harry 
W. Low wrote for a unanimous, three-member panel.

BORDER PATROL AGENT KILLED, PARTNER HURT IN SHOOT-OUT

An undercover Border Patrol agent was shot to death and his partner wounded 
early Wednesday as they tried to arrest four suspects involved in smuggling 
illegal aliens from Mexico, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A police SWAT team surrounded a residential neighborhood near the shooting 
scene and captured the four suspects, one by one, with the last apprehended 
after dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Connelly, 42, an 18-year veteran of the Border Patrol, died shortly after 
arriving at Valley Medical Center. Agent Ted Jordan, 42, a 17-year veteran, 
underwent surgery for a bullet wound to the chest and was in critical but 
stable condition at the same hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly and Jordan were Border Patrol special agents and members of a U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service anti-smuggling unit. They were posing as 
employers willing to pay cash in exchange for an undocumented worker, said Alan 
Dwelley, deputy chief Border Patrol agent. 
</P>
<P>
The undercover agents, who claimed that they needed a farm worker, had agreed 
to pay the suspects about $500, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An informant introduced the agents to the suspects, one of whom was a woman, on 
Saturday. They set up a meeting for Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly and Jordan met the suspects at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday in the parking lot 
of a service station-convenience store. Two other agents were parked nearby as 
backup, Dwelley said. 
</P>
<P>
"As the agents were in the process of making the arrests, things went sour," 
Dwelley said. "The suspects began firing, and both agents were shot." 
</P>
<P>
The two backup agents exchanged fire with the suspects as they fled, two on 
foot and the others in a car, which they abandoned a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
A Fresno Police Department SWAT team and Kern County sheriff's deputies sealed 
off a four-block area and began searching house to house. 
</P>
<P>
The female suspect was found about an hour after the shootings, and two others 
were found shortly before dawn. The final suspect was discovered about 7 a.m.

Hundreds of unauthorized street vendors near the presidential palace fought a 
pitched battle with riot police, and reports said 15 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation took place Tuesday evening on a block of Venustiano Carranza 
Street where some 300 vendors sell trinkets, transistor radios and other goods 
in makeshift stalls. The street is in the city's central district of historical 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
A police department news release said the riot squad was deployed when the 
vendors, who were blocking pedestrian and vehicle traffic, refused to clear the 
street. The injured, none of whom were seriously injured, were given first aid. 
</P>
<P>
For many months, shopkeepers have been complaining that the vendors, who pay no 
taxes and are not burdened with overhead costs, have been taking business away 
from them unfairly.

BILL ON HEALTH INSURANCE FOR POOR LOSES

<P>
A move to broaden the availability of health insurance in California failed 
Wednesday when the Assembly defeated legislation to provide basic and 
catastrophic coverage for those who cannot obtain it. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) failed on a 45-27 vote, nine short of 
the two-thirds majority it needed in the 80-member lower house. The Assembly 
granted permission to have the bill reconsidered before the Legislature 
adjourns for the year Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would create a nonprofit health insurance pool for the poor and for 
people who, because of serious illness, have been denied insurance coverage on 
the private market. Participation by insurance companies would be voluntary. 
The program would be operated privately but guided by a government-appointed 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who carried the bill on the 
floor, described the measure as "somewhat visionary." 
</P>
<P>
"It does not mandate anything," Brown said. "It simply affords the opportunity 
for this kind of thing to exist, which is not now available under existing 
law." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the bill was supported by groups representing large and small 
businesses as well as the insurance industry, organized labor and local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
But the bill was criticized for not providing a simple way for middle-class, 
working Californians to supplement their existing health coverage with a policy 
to protect them from financial ruin in case of a catastrophic illness or 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-La Mesa) said the measure is flawed because it would 
allow only those without insurance to purchase the catastrophic coverage. That 
means ordinary people covered by an individual or employee policy could not 
participate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-San Pedro) said he had authored a superior bill 
that would have allowed anyone to buy catastrophic coverage for as little as 
$59 a year. Elder said the insurance under his proposal would be cheaper 
because the cost of the program would be shared by healthy and ailing citizens, 
not just those who had already been denied insurance because of their 
illnesses. Robbins has estimated that his proposal would cost about $368 a 
month for an individual.

Thousands of students stayed away from Sacramento schools Wednesday as a 
walkout by teachers, counselors and nurses entered its second day. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, San Jose's 29,000 students attended their second day of school in 
classrooms staffed by teachers who came very close to striking but at the last 
minute accepted a tentative contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, teachers prepared to go back to school next week with a 6.4% pay 
hike approved by school trustees Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
These developments came as teachers in Illinois, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania 
voted to begin the new academic year on the picket lines, joining the ranks of 
about 8,000 public school teachers on strike Wednesday in eight states. 
</P>
<P>
More than 135,000 students were affected by strikes in California, Washington 
state, Montana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biggest Walkout 
</P>
<P>
The nation's biggest walkout is in the Sacramento City Unified School District, 
where 1,200 teachers have struck schools serving 47,000 pupils. 
</P>
<P>
At least 5,200 Sacramento students were absent Wednesday, district spokeswoman 
Penny Thrift said. The district lined up more than 1,000 substitutes, who were 
conducting classes alongside about 640 union teachers who crossed the picket 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Small groups of students walked out of class, telling reporters they were bored 
with prepared lessons given by some of the substitute teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,500 union workers -- teachers, counselors and nurses -- voted 
overwhelmingly early Tuesday to reject the district's latest contract offer, 
which included a 13% pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from both sides met informally throughout the day Wednesday trying 
to bridge disagreements on salary and fringe benefits. 
</P>
<P>
In other parts of California: 
</P>
<P>
* The 1,550 teachers in San Jose would get an 8% salary increase during the 
1989-90 school year under the contract, which will be considered during a 
ratification vote Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
* For the first time in three years, San Diego Unified School District trustees 
raised teachers' salaries before the start of the school year and without 
mediation. Pay hikes were given to 6,500 teachers and administrators, as well 
as to another 3,900 non-teaching employees.

* Teachers in the suburban San Juan School District northeast of Sacramento 
remained in the classroom Wednesday after voting earlier to postpone a strike 
and complete mediation and fact-finding procedures with the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere throughout the country, about 1,500 teachers in Elgin, Ill., voted 
late Tuesday to strike against the state's third largest school district, 
affecting 27,000 students. Marathon talks Tuesday in Quincy, Ill., were 
unsuccessful in ending a strike by 380 teachers that has kept 6,800 students 
out of classes since Aug. 29.

<P>
Public school teachers in Everett, Mass., voted unanimously Tuesday to reject a 
two-year contract offer and strike with the beginning of the school year 
Wednesday.

<P>
In Pennsylvania, the 159 teachers of the Perkiomen Valley School District in 
suburban Philadelphia reached a tentative contract agreement Tuesday afternoon, 
but strikes continued in three other districts.

SEN. TORRES, ON PROBATION, ACCUSED OF DRUNK DRIVING

Veteran Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who is on probation for a drunk 
driving conviction two years ago, was arrested and jailed by police early 
Wednesday and charged with the same offense. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Torres, 42, was jailed after he "could not perform" a breath test 
and refused to take other tests to determine his blood-alcohol level. 
</P>
<P>
He was released from jail but failed to attend a Senate floor session. A 
spokesman for Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said 
the two legislators talked by telephone but would not discuss the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Torres was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Torres' state-leased blue Chrysler convertible was observed driving 
without headlights at 12:55 a.m. in a residential and business area about a 
mile northeast of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Darrin Reese said the vehicle pulled over at an alley and Torres got 
out. "I observed him to be unsteady and could smell an odor of an alcoholic 
beverage on his breath," Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Torres, chairman of the Toxics and Public Safety Committee, refused to 
take a field sobriety test and was arrested for driving under the influence of 
alcohol. At the jail, Torres "could not perform the breath test and refused any 
other test," the police report said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres was arrested on a drunk driving charge near the Capitol early on July 
19, 1987, when his state car skidded and came within inches of crashing into a 
police car that had parked with its emergency lights flashing. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor charge in Municipal Court, paid fines 
totaling $827 and was placed on probation for three years. Court records show 
that conditions of his probation ordered him not to drink and drive and 
prohibited him from refusing to take any future chemical tests for 
blood-alcohol content. 
</P>
<P>
He also was restricted from driving other than to and from work for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1988, Torres suffered minor injuries when the speeding car in which 
he was asleep in a back seat went out of control in San Francisco and 
overturned. Police said they were told that Torres had lost the keys to his own 
car at a nightclub and accepted a ride from a friend.

Authorities arrested a consul general who allegedly sold forged Mexican 
passports and also broke up a gang in Tijuana that smuggled Central American 
aliens into the United States, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The government news agency Notimex said Fidel Alvarez Lopez, the Mexican consul 
general in Calexico, Calif., and two unidentified accomplices were taken 
Tuesday to Tijuana under heavy police escort. 
</P>
<P>
Notimex did not say when or where they were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
All three face preliminary charges of forgery and abuse of authority, the 
agency said. Alvarez refused to talk to reporters as he was escorted to jail. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the attorney general's office in Mexico City, which investigated 
the case, confirmed the arrest but refused to give details, saying the probe 
has not been completed. The spokesman spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$600 to $700 per Forgery 
</P>
<P>
Notimex said a preliminary investigation showed that Alvarez was involved in 
selling the forged passports for $600 to $700 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate case, 10 people were arrested in Tijuana in connection with a 
shakedown scheme that preyed on illegal aliens from Central America trying to 
sneak into the United States, the attorney general's office said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Six of those arrested were Guatemalan citizens, including a brother and two 
sisters. The news release said Federal Judicial Police picked them up as they 
tried to cross the border into San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the six will be deported to Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested were a Mexican immigration service officer, a junior officer 
trainee, a former immigration officer and a former judiciary police agent, all 
of whom demanded bribes of about $100 to let the aliens travel through Mexico 
into California, the news release said. 
</P>
<P>
The four are being held on charges of abuse of authority, accepting bribes and 
violating Mexico's immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Mexico has stepped up efforts to crack down on crime along 
the border, particularly drug trafficking and illegal migration. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown and increased cooperation between U. S. and Mexican border 
authorities was announced by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari after he took 
office in December.

2 ALIENS CLAIM CITY POLICE POCKETED THEIR MONEY DURING A RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two undocumented aliens have filed an unprecedented complaint alleging that 
uniformed San Diego police officers grabbed more than $500 from then in a raid 
last month, then pocketed the cash. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department's internal affairs office will investigate the complaint, 
police spokesman Bill Robinson said, adding that it is the first time to his 
knowledge that anyone has accused San Diego police of pocketing money from 
migrants. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto L. Martinez, head of the Quaker-sponsored immigration rights group that 
handled the formal complaint on behalf of the pair, Pascual Bustos, 24, and 
Jaime Andrade, 21, said Wednesday that police told him they expect to contact 
the men today for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Want to See Justice' 
</P>
<P>
Bustos and Andrade "don't think they'll get their money back, but they want to 
see justice done," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint alleges that two of the three officers involved in an Aug. 4 raid 
in San Diego's Logan Heights neighborhood gave each other the "low five" sign 
after taking $532 from Bustos and Andrade. It also alleges that Andrade was 
kicked while handcuffed and lying on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who runs the San Diego office of the American Friends Service 
Committee, said he had "no doubts whatsoever" about the truth of the pair's 
complaint. He translated it and filed it in the name of the Coalition for Law 
&amp; Justice, a Chicano civil rights group. 
</P>
<P>
Bustos and Andrade are "very sincere, hard-working young men who are sticking 
by their story," Martinez said. "They have not varied one way or the other. 
They've been very consistent with what they saw and heard. The fact that they 
are willing to stay and identify these officers tells me they're telling the 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said he sent copies of the complaint to the police internal affairs 
office, Police Chief Bob Burgreen and Murray L. Galinson, chairman of the 
Citizens' Review Board on Police Practices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awaiting Inquiry Results 
</P>
<P>
Galinson said Wednesday that the board will review the case only after the 
internal affairs probe is finished in about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Bustos and Andrade were not available Wednesday for comment. Bustos is living 
in San Diego's Sherman Heights area and Andrade, who briefly went back to 
Mexico, is expected to return this week to San Diego, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, which is dated Aug. 22, Bustos and Andrade crossed 
the border Aug. 4 and were taken early in the morning to a house near 31st 
Street and Imperial Avenue, where eight others, also apparently undocumented 
aliens, were inside. 
</P>
<P>
Bustos and Andrade had paid $300 to be taken to Los Angeles, Martinez said. The 
house was where they were to be picked up for the ride, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 10:30 a.m., three San Diego police officers "forced there (sic) way into 
the house with guns drawn," the complaint said. The officers demanded to know 
"where the 'drugs' were" and "lined us up facing the wall," it said. 
</P>
<P>
While one white female officer stood guard at the door, two white male officers 
"began searching us," the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
"When they came to Jaime and me, they took 52 American dollars from me, and 480 
American dollars from Jaime," it said. "When the officers saw how much money 
they had, they gave each other the 'low five' sign, then put the money in their 
pockets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Kicked in Stomach' 
</P>
<P>
The officers then "took Jaime aside and body searched him, handcuffed him, and 
then put him on the floor. One of the officers then kicked him hard in the 
stomach," the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the officers, the "one with the big ears," then called immigration 
authorities, the complaint said. "The police and the Migra (slang for the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service) joked and made fun of us," according to 
the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol agents took the migrants to the San Ysidro detention center, 
where Bustos reported the theft to the "agent in charge, but he just got mad 
and yelled at me," the complaint said.

SUSPECT IN CRIME SPREE AGAINST ELDERLY IN OAK PARK IS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspect has been arrested in connection with break-ins, rapes and robberies 
that had terrorized elderly Oak Park residents, San Diego police said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Lucious, 29, of the 3800 block of Superba Street in Southeast San Diego, 
was arrested at his home by San Diego police and state parole officers at 10:20 
p.m. Tuesday, said police spokesman Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Lucious was booked into the downtown jail, where he is being held on suspicion 
of two rapes, armed robbery, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon, 
Robinson said. Bail was set at $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens in the Oak Park neighborhood reported three robberies between 
Aug. 23-26 in which three men were attacked and a woman raped inside homes. 
Police said at the time they believed the crimes were related. 
</P>
<P>
Lucious was arrested after state parole authorities noted similarities between 
his past record and the Oak Park incidents, according to Robinson.

FILM PROMOTER PLEADS NO CONTEST IN SEX CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dale Normand, accused by two teenage girls of sexual misconduct after promising 
them movie roles, pleaded no contest Wednesday to one misdemeanor count of 
having unlawful sex with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
Normand, 35, entered the plea before Superior Court Judge Andrew Wagner, who 
set an Oct. 4 sentencing date, said Normand's attorney, Robert Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
Normand, who was facing multiple criminal counts, agreed to a plea bargain on a 
single charge and could receive up to one year in County Jail and a $1,000 
fine. The remaining counts were dismissed, and he remains free on bond. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charges against Normand were brought by a Michigan teen-ager who 
was 17 when he invited her to San Diego last year to appear in a movie. The 
girl said Normand, who had an office in Mission Valley, promised her modeling 
jobs in addition to the movie role. She told local authorities that Normand had 
sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg McClain said the charge of unlawful sex was brought 
against Normand because the young woman was a minor at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, an 18-year-old San Carlos woman obtained a restraining order 
against Normand, and in court documents alleged that "he used lies and 
deception to have sex with me." However, no charges were brought against him in 
this case. 
</P>
<P>
Both teen-agers said they were hired by Normand to appear in a movie and 
eventually moved in with him. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego vice officers began investigating Normand in April, 1988, when they 
received several complaints about Normand from parents and young women. Lt. Dan 
Johnson, head of the department's vice unit, said the complaints arose during a 
talent search conducted by Normand and involved girls as young as 16. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1988 interview, Normand said he was making a spy thriller that would 
feature a group of young, "beautiful female Rambos" who were "articulate and 
sophisticated." During the interview he acknowledged that he had no previous 
movie-making experience.

AVALON COUNCIL REJECTS EMERGENCY CONSTRUCTION BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before an overflow crowd at City Hall Tuesday, the Avalon City Council 
unanimously rejected a proposed emergency moratorium that would have prohibited 
any new development in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted after hearing from residents who, at an earlier meeting, had 
submitted petitions with more than 600 signatures of those opposed to 
high-density units and buildings as high as 40 feet on the hillsides 
overlooking the Santa Catalina Island town. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members said a moratorium is not necessary because the council 
already decided in July to review the height limitation issue at a joint study 
session with the Planning Commission on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it gives both bodies time to try to come up with some answers to some 
bothering questions," Councilman John Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips also questioned the need for urgency. "Some people may consider their 
view or their investment at stake, but I don't think that would warrant an 
emergency moratorium," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Paul Puma, who moved to introduce the ordinance at the Aug. 15 
council meeting, voted against it Tuesday because of the scheduled study 
session. 
</P>
<P>
"The statute that was prepared was more restrictive than we felt was necessary 
in view of the fact that we're having a meeting next Tuesday with the Planning 
Commission and making some decisions as to height limitation and 
lot-to-square-footage density ratios," Puma said. 
</P>
<P>
A six-year building moratorium that had been in effect because of Avalon's 
water shortage was lifted earlier this year when a planned hotel project fell 
through, making water available for other projects. The City Council voted 4 to 
1 to allow 26 new developments and expansions of existing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's building code, structures on hillsides greater than a 
15-degree angle must be no more than 40 feet high at the lower end of the slope 
and no more than 14 feet high at the upper end, City Manager Chuck Prince said. 
Or, a hillside building could maintain a uniform height of 28 feet along the 
slope, the same height limitation for non-hillside buildings in Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents, however, maintain that the 40-foot limitation is too high and 
that some planned hillside developments, if built to that maximum, would be out 
of scale with the smaller, older homes surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Connolly, an Avalon resident for 14 years who lives next to a six-unit 
condominium project on Whittley Avenue, helped spearhead the petition drive. 
The petition urged the council to lower the height limitation of hillside 
buildings to a maximum of 28 feet on lower slopes, while maintaining a 14-foot 
height restriction on upper slopes. 
</P>
<P>
"People are against this massive building that's going on in Avalon," Connolly 
said. "It impacts the entire community because it affects height, parking, 
sewage, light, air, sun and views." 
</P>
<P>
Connolly has an appeal before the City Council of the Planning Commission's 
approval of the Whittley Avenue project, which is proposed for a vacant lot 
next to her home. Connolly is appealing the addition of two bonus units, which 
by city ordinance can be allowed for use as low- to moderate-income housing. 
Under city guidelines, the developer agreed to rent the two bonus units as 
year-round housing for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Project Appealed 
</P>
<P>
A separate appeal of a planned four-unit condominium development on Metropole 
Avenue has been filed by Lolo Saldana, a 35-year Metropole Avenue resident who 
also gathered petition signatures of residents opposed to the present hillside 
limitations. 
</P>
<P>
Saldana's son, Gilbert, a former mayor of Avalon, has acted as a spokesman for 
his father and other Metropole Avenue residents opposed to the size of the 
planned development. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Saldana was on the Avalon City Council in 1981 when the height limits 
were passed. Although he voted for the 40-foot limit then, he said, it has 
since proven too overwhelming for Avalon's small-scale homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation has never really been put to the test because six of the eight 
years the ordinance has been in effect, the city has had a building 
moratorium," Saldana said. "A handful of projects have gotten through within 
those height limits, and it's because of those projects people are seeing what 
40 feet is and saying it's time to change it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40 Feet High 
</P>
<P>
The project next to his father's home, for example, will be about 40 feet high 
on one side. 
</P>
<P>
"This project will literally be towering over at least five homes in the 
immediate vicinity," he said. "We respect their right to build. . . . If they 
build there, we just want them to build something more in tune with the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Prince said the issue has been an increasing concern for city 
officials for the past year because of a housing shortage for year-round Avalon 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"A good portion of hillside lots are zoned high density," Prince said. "Most of 
the hillside lots are surrounded by older homes and haven't been built on 
because they were less desirable lots." Because land has become so scarce in 
Avalon, he said, "all property is desirable." 
</P>
<P>
Both of the planned developments at issue are being built by Whittley 
Properties, whose general partner Robert Lynam, is a general contractor and 
longtime island resident. Lynam was unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jay Feinberg, Lynam's partner in the Metropole Avenue development, 
called the issue "a neighborhood dispute." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Showed Great Wisdom' 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is they're trying to blow this thing out of proportion with a city 
ban because that's the only way they could approach it," Feinberg said. "I 
think the council showed great wisdom in not penalizing the whole town over 
these two projects." 
</P>
<P>
Feinberg said the projects were approved by the Planning Commission after the 
developers met numerous requests for design changes, including a height 
reduction from 14 feet to six feet on one side of the Whittley Avenue project. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Feinberg said, both projects meet height limitations that were 
adopted by the city in 1981 and have never been an issue until now. 
</P>
<P>
"These protests are a little late," Feinberg said. "People had eight years to 
protest the code, and then all of a sudden it comes out of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
At the Aug. 15 council meeting, Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith asked Connolly, 
Gilbert Saldana and the Whittley Properties developers to try to reach a 
compromise on the size of the developments before the Oct. 3 council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The group has met once, and a second meeting is scheduled for Saturday, said 
Smith, who with Councilman Hal Host has acted as a mediator at the meetings.

TORRANCE OKS SIZE LIMITS TO AVOID BIG HOMES ON SMALL LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 18 meetings on the matter and at least 50 hours of public debate, 
Torrance City Council members late Tuesday approved new limits on the size of 
single-family houses in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 5 to 2, with Councilmen Bill Applegate and Dan Walker 
opposed, to create a new ordinance limiting house sizes to no more than 60% of 
a lot's square footage. 
</P>
<P>
About 32,000 lots zoned for single-family development will be affected by the 
new standards, created in response to a trend toward tearing down older, 
single-story houses to make way for bulky, two-story replacements. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules will not affect existing houses but will apply when a property 
owner wishes to demolish a house, add a second story or significantly remodel 
an existing structure. 
</P>
<P>
Although obviously pleased at finally voting on an issue that they have been 
debating for more than a year, council members admitted that the matter is not 
entirely resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert asked staff members to bring back additional proposals in 
coming weeks that would create a review system for homeowners wishing to build 
houses that exceed the 60% limit. 
</P>
<P>
Geissert, who said the new standards will protect homeowners from watching "the 
American dream going beyond their wildest dreams," also asked planners to write 
a proposal that would create a maximum house size, possibly 4,500 or 5,000 
square feet, regardless of lot size. 
</P>
<P>
Neither developers, who had hoped for a more lenient 65% limit, nor homeowners, 
who were lobbying for no more than 55%, were entirely pleased with the 
compromise measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure the city isn't looking to create an architectural review board," 
builder Rick Gaunt said, charging that the new limits and the possible review 
process will sharply curtail what an architect may design in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners noted that the 60% restriction still will allow significantly larger 
houses than most neighborhoods have now. 
</P>
<P>
"People still will be able to build a home three times the size of ours, where 
we are raising our families quite well," homeowner Anita Hall told the council. 
"We are deciding tonight what Torrance will look like in the future. . . . Will 
it be the bright, happy, open community we see now?" 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Walker complained that the new standards will discourage remodeling 
and charged that the city was negligent by not mailing owners of single-family 
houses a description of the changes being considered. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people will wake up . . . at some time in the future and find they 
cannot make the addition they always assumed they could make, because the house 
across the street was built that way," Walker said. "When remodeling is 
restricted, then you have a basic denigration of the community."

RANCHO P.V. TO WORK WITH EASTVIEW PARENTS IN SCHOOL SECESSION BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Admitting that they are facing an uphill battle, Rancho Palos Verdes officials 
are joining forces with residents of the city's large Eastview section to bring 
their children into the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"You must petition for this, but we can help you through the process," Mayor 
Jacki Bacharach told residents at Tuesday's City Council meeting. The council 
will vote Sept. 19 on a resolution supporting the transfer of Eastview from the 
Los Angeles Unified School District to the Palos Verdes system so that all 
peninsula youngsters will be in the same district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Task Force Proposed 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating opposition from the Los Angeles district, which vigorously fought 
a 1987 school secession bid in Lomita that failed, the council also proposed 
that a task force of involved public agencies and residents be formed to work 
on the transfer proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The task force would include representatives of the two school districts and 
state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) and Assemblyman Gerald N. 
Felando (R-San Pedro), who represent the peninsula. It would also include 
members of the East Peninsula Educational Council, a parents group that has 
sought to split the district and prevent the proposed closure of Miraleste High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
The school board voted to close the east-side school in 1987 because of 
declining enrollment, but the decision has been delayed pending the outcome of 
legal action against the district. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Yeager, president of the Rolling Hills Riviera Homeowners Assn. in 
Eastview, said the community is not dissatisfied with the quality of Los 
Angeles education but wants to complete the annexation process begun in 1983. 
At that time, Eastview -- which constitutes 20% of the Rancho Palos Verdes 
population -- came into the city, but the students remained in the Los Angeles 
district. 
</P>
<P>
They attend Dodson Junior High School and Crestwood Elementary School in Rancho 
Palos Verdes, and San Pedro High School. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert Ryan and Jeffrey Younggren, president of the Palos Verdes 
district Board of Education, termed the secession effort an uphill fight. 
</P>
<P>
Saying the proposal will never survive the process of petition and hearings at 
the local and state levels, Ryan urged that the city hire a lobbyist and begin 
seeking special legislation to bring Eastview into the peninsula school system. 
</P>
<P>
Younggren, who said it "makes sense" for Eastview to be in the local district, 
predicted that the proposal -- which involves a predominantly Anglo student 
group -- will run up against the ethnic balance criteria of the state Board of 
Education, which has the ultimate say in whether a secession election is held. 
</P>
<P>
A key issue in the unsuccessful Lomita secession was whether it damaged school 
integration efforts. Bill Honig, state superintendent of public instruction, 
said in a report that losing Lomita students "would adversely affect existing 
desegregation programs" in the Los Angeles district and urged that it be 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number of White Students 
</P>
<P>
Ron Apperson, Los Angeles district legal adviser, said the district's major 
concern about the Eastview secession is that Los Angeles would be giving up a 
substantial number of white students in an area bordered by ethnic communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to a court plan and court order, and here you have a 
substantial white population in a district of diminishing whites," he said. 
"Our sense of integration would counsel the board to look critically at this." 
</P>
<P>
School district boundary matters are handled by the Los Angeles County 
Committee on School District Organization, an arm of the Los Angeles County 
Office of Education. Its 11 members are elected by the 95 school districts 
within the county. 
</P>
<P>
Petitions to transfer territory must be signed by 25% of the registered voters 
within the transfer area, and if they are held valid, the committee conducts 
public hearings in the districts affected. A recommendation is then made to the 
state board, which holds a public hearing and decides if an election on the 
district change should be held. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Town Hall Meeting Planned 
</P>
<P>
In addition to forming the task force, the council authorized assigning a staff 
member to work with Eastview residents and will conduct a town hall meeting in 
Eastview on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Yeager said the residents, who have yet formally to circulate petitions, have 
held off for years in the belief that they could not overcome opposition by the 
Los Angeles district. But, he said, they have been encouraged by the success of 
the east-side parents group in delaying the Palos Verdes proposal to close 
Miraleste. 
</P>
<P>
Eastview resident Craig Kelford told the council that his community can 
contribute to that effort. "We can get 300 to 600 kids to Miraleste, . . . keep 
that campus open," he said. "And don't turn it over to developers."

MOBIL EFFORTS DISCLOSED TO PREEMPT TORRANCE'S AUTHORITY 
</P>

<P>
Mobil Oil Corp. has been pressing for legislation that could preempt the city 
of Torrance's authority to require a risk management plan for extremely 
hazardous chemicals stored at the company's refinery. 
</P>
<P>
But Frederick Taugher, a Mobil lobbyist, said Wednesday, after The Times began 
to make inquiries about the proposal, that he had been told by Mobil management 
that the company would not proceed with pressure for any legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been in preliminary discussions, but they made the decision not to 
pursue those any further," Taugher said. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Taugher said he had talked to the offices of at least 
two lawmakers, Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Carson) and Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Floyd said Wednesday that he does not plan to help Mobil, partly because the 
Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for the year on Sept. 15. "It's too late in 
the year to do anything," Floyd said. "They should have been doing something 
earlier." 
</P>
<P>
A source close to Torres indicated that the senator declined to champion 
Mobil's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stepped-Up Lobbying 
</P>
<P>
Mobil, upset with city efforts to regulate the refinery after a November, 1987, 
hydrofluoric acid explosion and two-day fire drew attention to the facility, 
has recently stepped up its lobbying efforts in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance refinery, which supplies 12% of Southern California's gasoline, 
uses hydrofluoric acid to boost octane levels. Mobil has estimated that it 
would cost $100 million to switch to sulfuric acid, the catalyst used by most 
other major refineries. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Mobil acknowledged that it was considering seeking 
legislation to preempt Torrance's regulation of the lethal chemical. 
</P>
<P>
In the past week, according to several legislative sources, Mobil has 
intensified its efforts by pitching a proposal to curb the ability of small and 
medium-sized cities to require businesses to prepare a risk management report. 
The reports, authorized under state law, spell out the dangers of extremely 
hazardous materials at industrial sites and the procedures for protecting the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Taugher said Mobil has had "some discussion, . . . more exploratory than 
anything" with staff in the offices of Floyd and Torres. He said the talks had 
been partly to determine if it was feasible to expect any legislation to be 
introduced and enacted into law this year. He declined to provide details of 
his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a considerable problem of cities in the same general area developing 
different standards for the use of hazardous materials," Taugher said. "What 
one city does . . . affects neighboring cities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initiative Cited 
</P>
<P>
Taugher also cited a Torrance ballot initiative aimed at forcing Mobil to stop 
using hydrofluoric acid in the city as another reason for pressing for 
legislation. The measure is scheduled to be on the ballot next March. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city filed a lawsuit against Mobil in April alleging that the 
refinery is a public nuisance and seeking the authority to regulate it. 
</P>
<P>
Before Mobil decided to drop its legislative proposal, Taugher said: 
"Obviously, the election is of concern, but as I say, nobody has made a 
decision about doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gerald Felando (R-San Pedro), who said he discussed the matter with 
Floyd on Tuesday, said he would have "opposed it vigorously. The constituents 
in that community have the right to decide what's going to happen with Mobil 
Oil. Nobody else (does). . . ." Felando, whose district includes Torrance, 
added: "I don't believe another legislator should meddle in another 
legislator's district." 
</P>
<P>
Infuriated Torrance officials characterized Mobil's lobbying effort as an 
attempt to end-run their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another example of them trying to subvert a process and get around a 
safety problem," said Councilman Dan Walker, who sponsored the ballot measure. 
"The industry and Mobil have watered down the risk management requirements to 
such an extent that they're almost useless now, and then to try to take 
Torrance out of it. . . It's underhanded." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hatchet Work' 
</P>
<P>
Walker said he doubts that Mobil would have found a sponsor even if it had 
decided to continue its lobbying efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine anyone doing Mobil's hatchet work for them," he said. "Mobil's 
got to understand that they've got to start working with people and stop trying 
to subvert the process." 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, cities and counties have the option of requiring businesses 
to perform a risk management assessment to catalogue the dangers of hazardous 
materials they handle, partly to help health and fire departments prepare 
emergency plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Mobil proposal, according to two legislative sources, sought to prohibit 
cities with populations under about 200,000 from being able to require such a 
program. The population of Torrance is 141,500. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's outrageous," Mayor Katy Geissert said. "I understand what their 
practical logic is, but what is their public logic? Are they trying to say that 
people in smaller cities are less susceptible to the effects of hazardous 
substances? . . . This would put cities like Torrance at the mercy of big 
government and the power of well-heeled lobbyists." 
</P>
<P>
Last March, a Mobil study, required under present law, concluded that continued 
use of hydrofluoric acid at the Torrance refinery poses almost no risk to the 
public. The study also concluded that there is less than a 1% chance each year 
of a single death occurring in the community from the use of the lethal acid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiations Going On 
</P>
<P>
Since Mobil turned in the study, Torrance hazardous materials analysts have 
been negotiating with refinery officials to make the document more detailed and 
bring it into line with state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Fire Chief Scott Adams said Mobil's risk report was one of the first 
such studies prepared under the new state laws allowing cities to require them. 
</P>
<P>
Because basic state guidelines for putting together such a study continue to 
change and had not even been completely written when Torrance ordered Mobil to 
begin work on its document, the fine-tuning could take several more months, 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Mobil study has been completely reviewed, Adams said, Torrance intends 
to seek risk management assessments from other companies in the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fine-Tuning Bill 
</P>
<P>
Mobil sounded out Floyd about his interest in its proposal partly because he 
has introduced a bill to fine-tune the risk management program, according to a 
Floyd aide. Among other things, Floyd's measure would require local agencies to 
force businesses with the highest risk of an accident to prepare risk 
management programs ahead of other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd minimized the significance of his staff's discussing Mobil's revisions to 
his bill, which is pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody gets all excited because we discuss things," Floyd said. "That's 
what we're here for. . . . My door is open. We listen to everybody and all 
their problems, and we look at options." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd said he was unsure of the details of the Mobil proposal. But, in apparent 
reference to the cost of switching to sulfuric acid for refining, Floyd said: 
"It's a $100-million problem to them," so it's natural for Mobil to seek 
legislative relief. 
</P>
<P>
But losing the right to require risk management programs would harm Torrance's 
ability to regulate companies besides Mobil, City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are an industrial city, and the (risk management) process is a very 
important element in protecting the health and safety of the public in this day 
and age," he said. Attempts to limit the rights of smaller cities "would be 
discriminatory," Nelson said.

BILL TO EXTEND CONSERVANCY TO 1995 APPROVED BY LEGISLATURE

<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy would be given a new lease on life under 
a bill that passed the Legislature on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which the Assembly approved by a 59-14 margin and sent to Gov. 
George Deukmejian, would extend until 1995 the life of the agency, which buys 
parkland in the mountains surrounding the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has acquired 10,000 acres of parkland since it was established in 
1979. It is due to go out of business in July. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsoring Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) said he was optimistic about 
Deukmejian signing the measure into law. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he will. I'm hoping he will," said Rosenthal, whose 22nd District 
includes parts of Encino, Sherman Oaks, Tarzana and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looked Upon More Favorably 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said he is optimistic partly because the agency in recent years has 
been looked upon more favorably by Republican legislators. Westside Democrats 
have championed similar proposals on the Assembly floor, but this year Pat 
Nolan (R-Glendale) handled the measure for Rosenthal in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, voters approved a park and wildlife bond issue that set aside $30 
million of the $776 million total for the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal cited the funds set aside by the bond issue as a major reason that he 
was supporting the conservancy extension. He said that at least until the funds 
are spent the conservancy should be given extra time to finish its business.

L.A. SAYS BUILDER CAN RENT CONDOS IN WARNER CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much to the disappointment of homeowners and a Los Angeles City Council member, 
officials said Wednesday that they have determined that units in what was 
advertised as a luxury condominium complex under construction in Warner Center 
can legally be rented instead of sold. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the city's planning and transportation departments said in 
findings released Wednesday that changing the status of the 760-unit Summit 
project from condominiums to apartments does not mean that the project can be 
halted or delayed by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joy Picus last month had asked the departments to examine the 
Summit project, saying the change in status raised questions about whether its 
approval should be withdrawn. Homeowners in Woodland Hills had opposed changing 
the condominiums to apartments, saying rental units would bring additional 
noise and traffic and would lower the area's property values. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assessing Impact 
</P>
<P>
In launching the inquiry, Picus questioned whether the developer, G. H. Palmer, 
had addressed the environmental impact of the change, as well as the effect on 
traffic and parking that apartment dwellers would have on the area. 
</P>
<P>
Picus lamented the findings. "I wish I had some tool to get them to sell the 
units instead of renting them, but it does not appear that I have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Building and Safety Department, which Picus also asked to examine 
the Summit project, had not yet rendered a final decision on the project. But a 
department official said last week that a preliminary examination showed that 
the developer apparently could alter the project from condominiums to 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner leader Gordon Murley said he was angered by the rulings. 
"Technically, they're right, but Palmer had said in all the documents that 
those units would be sold," he said. "We take great issue with this." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer executives announced last month that economics and an analysis of real 
estate conditions indicated that it was impractical to sell the units, even 
though they had been advertised for sale as luxury townhouses. Palmer spokesmen 
said the firm never promised to sell the units. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the developer nor his representatives could be reached for comment 
Wednesday.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PIER PARKING REPAIRS STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The northern half of the Municipal Pier parking structure in Redondo Beach will 
be repaired after a consulting firm completes a structural analysis later this 
year, Public Works Director Ken Montgomery said. He said the 25-year-old 
structure is showing signs of deterioration but none that would warrant 
concerns about public safety. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery said corrosion of steel reinforcing rods in concrete slabs and 
columns has produced cracks and spalling, or surface chipping, in some areas, 
particularly on the upper deck of the two-level structure, which is exposed to 
salty air and mist. Spalling occurs, he said, when rust expands the steel rods, 
causing surface pieces of concrete to pop out. 
</P>
<P>
He said the consulting firm, T.Y. Lin International of San Francisco, will take 
core samples, calculate structural strengths and estimate repair costs. The 
City Council has budgeted $200,000 for the project. 
</P>
<P>
The north half of the parking structure extends over the Fun Factory and other 
businesses along the International Boardwalk. The south half, a three-level 
structure built about 15 years ago, may be included later in the engineering 
studies, Montgomery said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRANSFERS OF 8 STUDENTS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles judge ruled Wednesday that the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified 
School District could allow eight students to transfer from Miraleste High 
School to Rolling Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel said the district did not technically violate 
her 1988 ruling prohibiting it from closing Miraleste or transferring any 
east-side students to west-side schools until it completes an environmental 
impact report on school closures districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which decided in 1987 to close Miraleste because of declining 
enrollment, is preparing the report. 
</P>
<P>
The transfers were challenged by the East Peninsula Education Council, the 
parents group that seeks to split the district and keep Miraleste open. The 
group filed a legal motion that sought to have the district found in contempt 
for allowing the transfers to occur. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said the eight students live closer to Rolling Hills High 
than to Miraleste. They said that even if the parents prevailed and a second 
school district were formed on the peninsula, those areas would remain part of 
the existing district. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel also ruled that any future disputes between the parents group and the 
district should be resolved before her on an informal basis.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLANE CRASH KILLS SYLMAR STUDENT PILOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sylmar woman was killed when the private plane she was piloting crashed as 
she tried to make an emergency landing at California City Airport in Kern 
County, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Theresia Ann Niesner, 51, had just taken off from the airport about 10 a.m. 
when she radioed the tower, reported mechanical trouble and began circling the 
airport to land, said Jaye Wilowski, California City Police Department 
dispatcher. The plane's wing struck the ground, and the craft crashed and 
exploded, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Niesner had arrived from Van Nuys Airport, about 70 miles to the south, and was 
on a return flight when the plane crashed, Wilowski said. Niesner, a student 
pilot, was alone in the four-seat plane, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the crash was under investigation by the National Transportation 
Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration, authorities said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ahead-on collision Wednesday morning on a desert stretch of Palmdale Boulevard 
in Palmdale left one man dead and two others critically injured, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred shortly after 7:30 a.m. when the driver of a car headed west 
drifted into the oncoming lane and slammed into an eastbound car at about 62nd 
Street East, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Ronald 
Thomason.

<P>
The first driver died of his injuries about two hours later. His identity was 
withheld until relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
Two other men were hospitalized. Michael Villa Balis, 20, was in critical 
condition at Antelope Valley Medical Center. The other man, whom hospital 
officials declined to identify, was at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRUCK BLOCKS 3 LANES OF SAN DIEGO FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Astalled truck blocked three lanes of the San Diego Freeway near Mulholland 
Drive Wednesday morning, backing up rush-hour traffic for several miles, the 
California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured, but traffic was at a virtual standstill from Sepulveda Pass 
to the Simi Valley Freeway, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck stalled in southbound lanes about 7:40 a.m. when it apparently lost 
its drive shaft, authorities said. The driver tried to park it on the shoulder 
but failed, Officer Mike Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was removed from traffic lanes about an hour later, but traffic 
remained congested until about 11 a.m., Sgt. Dan Rodman said.

ANGELS STILL IN MOUND OF TROUBLE; 
</P>
<P>
TWO TWO-RUN HOME RUNS OFF PETRY HELP BREWERS, 7-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chuck Finley tested his sprained toe Wednesday afternoon, throwing off an 
imaginary mound in the outfield and fielding bunts during a pregame workout. 
His toe responded favorably, and he termed his progress "encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of hours later, however, reality set in at Anaheim Stadium, and 
discouraging was the best word to describe the Angels' status. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Petry, starting in place of Finley, had to throw off a real mound to real 
hitters, and his fielding prowess wasn't a factor. Veteran Robin Yount and 
rookie George Canale each hit a two-run homer off Petry as Milwaukee defeated 
the Angels, 7-4, before a crowd of 22,459. 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who has already missed two weeks, may be on the road to recovery. But 
it's probably too late for the Angels, who are in need of a major turnaround if 
they are to keep their division title hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Brewers might have pulled the plug Wednesday night, considering 
that the Oakland Athletics had already won in the afternoon. The third-place 
Angels trail the A's by 5 1/2 games with only 23 games remaining. If Oakland 
wins half of its final 22 games, the Angels would have to win 17 to tie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely important to stay optimistic, to go out and do the best job on 
a day-to-day basis," Manager Doug Rader said. "It's fashionable to become 
disheartened early, but to our people's credit, they don't seem to give in to 
that kind of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
While they may not be conceding anything yet, there are some subtle signs of 
frustration in the Big A these days. Rader, who has made a determined effort to 
say all the right things all season long, let a bit of paranoia escape before 
the game when a television broadcaster mentioned that some members of the media 
already had written off his team. 
</P>
<P>
"They wrote us off on day one," Rader said. "They didn't give us a ghost of a 
chance. And now, most of those people are probably happy because they can say 
they were right all along. 
</P>
<P>
"But we don't see it that way. We're only four games behind in the loss 
column." 
</P>
<P>
Make it five. 
</P>
<P>
What the Angels did see was their chances for the American League West title 
dwindle Wednesday night when a quartet of Angel pitchers couldn't make up for 
the loss of one Finley. And Brewer pitcher Chris Bosio completely stifled the 
Angel offense for eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
A solo homer by Wally Joyner, his 14th, in the seventh was all the Angels could 
do against Bosio until the ninth, when they mustered a last-gasp, four-single, 
three-run outburst that cut the Brewers' lead to three. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Dan Plesac came in to get the last two outs and pick up his 29th save 
of the season. As a result, Bosio (15-9) earned his eighth victory in his last 
11 decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck (Finley) is having a great year, and it's certainly nice to throw him 
out there every fifth game," third baseman Jack Howell said. "But we've 
overcome a lot of other things this season, and now's the time to kick it in 
and let it out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's anyone on this team who doesn't believe (a division 
title) is still attainable." 
</P>
<P>
That goal slipped further from the Angels' reach, due primarily to Bosio. The 
second Angel batter of the game, Max Venable, dumped a fly-ball double down the 
left-field line, but then Bosio retired 13 in a row before Howell dropped a 
broken-bat single into center field in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us a long time before we were disciplined enough to stay back on his 
breaking ball," Rader said. "We just weren't able to get any runs early." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels mounted their mini-rally in the ninth, when Venable picked up his 
second hit of the game -- and fourth in two nights -- and Claudell Washington 
marked his return to the lineup with a single. Joyner forced Washington, but 
singles by Chili Davis and Brian Downing made the Angels' inability to hold off 
the Brewers early in the game that much harder to bear. 
</P>
<P>
"Petry made a couple of pitches early that cost him," Rader said. "He got one 
up to Yount and another one up to Canale." 
</P>
<P>
Petry was making his 271st major league start, but only his fourth of this 
season. And the Brewers had him reeling before he had a chance to get 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Felder led off the game with a single to left and promptly stole second. 
Two outs later, Yount slugged a homer to left, and Milwaukee had a 2-0 
advantage. Since the All-Star break, the veteran center fielder is hitting 
almost .350 with eight homers and 39 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Petry settled down and allowed only one single through the next two innings, 
but the Brewers went to the long ball again in the fourth to build a four-run 
lead, and this time, youth was served. After rookie Greg Vaughn drew a one-out 
walk, Canale, 24, got his first major league hit, an opposite-field shot over 
the wall in left-center. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Monteleone came in to pitch the fifth, and Petry was left with a 
less-than-impressive line: four innings pitched, four hits, four runs, three 
walks, one strikeout and two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Monteleone gave up three consecutive singles -- and the Brewers' fifth run -- 
in the fifth. He was followed to the mound by Sherman Corbett, who surrendered 
two more runs in the eighth on a double by Charlie O'Brien, two ground-outs and 
a solo homer by shortstop Bill Spiers. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher No. 4, Greg Minton, escaped unscathed, but the game -- and maybe even 
the season -- was a lost cause by then. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels acquired journeyman minor league catcher Ron Tingley Wednesday from 
Cleveland's triple-A affiliate in Colorado Springs for a player to be named 
later. The move came just in time. Tingley, who played for Angel Manager Doug 
Rader in Hawaii (then San Diego's triple-A team), will help fill the void left 
by backup catcher Bill Schroeder, who is lost for the season. Schroeder 
underwent a diagnostic test on his sore right elbow Wednesday and will undergo 
arthroscopic surgery Monday to remove bone spurs. Starting catcher Lance 
Parrish, who has been bothered by a nagging left knee injury, will be in the 
hospital today, receiving diagnostic tests to determine the extent of the 
problem. "We're at the point that we're lucky to get (Tingley)," Rader said. 
"He's a so-so hitter, but he's a hell of a catcher and thrower." Tingley, 30, 
was drafted in the 10th round by San Diego in 1977 and made his major league 
debut with the Padres in 1982. His next major league appearance came last year 
with Cleveland. Tingley, who hit .257 with six home runs and 38 RBIs for 
Colorado Springs, said the trade was a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
Claudell Washington, who left the team last weekend and returned home to 
Orinda, Calif., for "personal reasons," rejoined the Angels Wednesday. "It was 
a stress-related family matter," Washington said, declining to elaborate beyond 
that. "I think everything's going to be OK, though." Washington, who also 
missed nine games in May when his daughter was seriously injured in a household 
accident, said he has never been through a year so fraught with off-the-field 
distractions. "In 16 years, I've never been through anything like this," he 
said. "It's been a rough season. But I'm back now and ready to go anytime they 
need me." Washington entered the game in the seventh inning as a defensive 
replacement in right field. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Chuck Finley worked out in the outfield before Wednesday night's 
game, making defensive moves and fielding bunts, and said the strained toe on 
his left foot felt pretty good. "We wanted him to move to field balls and do 
quick stuff when he wouldn't have time to think to protect it," pitching coach 
Marcel Lachemann said. Finley passed the test and will throw off a mound again 
today and probably pitch batting practice soon.

MORNING BRIEFING: MANDARICH, 310-POUND ROOKIE, HAS TIPPED THE NFL'S PAY SCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Green Bay Packers might have created a monster when they signed offensive 
lineman Tony Mandarich to a four-year contract reportedly worth $4.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it's each club's prerogative to say yes or no to any figure," said 
Jim Finks, president and general manager of the New Orleans Saints. 
"Unfortunately, what's happened is that there's been so much hype over the 
college draft during the last few years that everything is out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the exact numbers handy, but of the 336 players drafted last 
year, 75% or 80% are no longer playing. Heck, 70 draft choices were waived 
(Monday). 
</P>
<P>
"And if you want to track the ones that do stay, how many do you think become 
great contributors? The amount of money this league has spent on prospects -- 
and that's all they are -- is staggering." 
</P>
<P>
Who's fault is that? 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it clear that we -- and by that I mean the clubs -- have nobody 
to blame but ourselves," Finks said. "But now we have guys coming into the 
league whose careers are too well orchestrated. 
</P>
<P>
"Agents call a guy a 'franchise player,' the newspapers pick it up and soon the 
fans in town start saying, 'Yeah, we're not winning because our club isn't 
putting out the money.' It's a vicious cycle.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add Mandarich: The former Michigan State All-American, who is 6 feet 5 inches 
and weighs 310 pounds, reportedly consumes 15,000 calories a day. David 
Letterman attempted to fit a typical Mandarich meal onto his desk one night and 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Fernando Valenzuela of the Dodgers had eight shutouts in the 1981 
season, equaling a 68-year-old major league rookie record. With whom does he 
share the record and how many shutouts has Valenzuela had since? 
</P>
<P>
And you thought you had it bad: Consider the plight of Steve Waugh from this 
account of an English cricket match: "Nick Cook, who mixed some magnificent 
deliveries with a number of very ordinary ones, picked up three wickets; fellow 
spinner Eddie Hemmings demonstrated commendable accuracy and debut-making fast 
bowler Devon Malcolm gained a thoroughly well-deserved first Test victim when 
removing . . . Steve Waugh for a duck." 
</P>
<P>
On-the-air Jordan: According to a billboard that has gone up alongside a 
Detroit freeway, Motor City residents should be able to hear Chicago Bulls 
broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
The billboard urges listeners to tune in WLUP, a Chicago radio station. 
According to WLUP station manager Larry Wert, broadcasts of the Bulls' games 
can be heard in Detroit on clear nights. 
</P>
<P>
Cracked Harry Hutt, director of broadcasting for the Detroit Pistons: 
"Apparently the Bulls can't get enough listeners in Chicago and Illinois. We 
don't have to go anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Odoriferous: How would Darryl Strawberry evaluate his play this season? "It 
boils down to, I'm having a stink year," the New York Mets' right fielder told 
Newsday. "Some people might say stinky. This is the first time I've had a whole 
season where I had to say that." 
</P>
<P>
Through Wednesday's games, Strawberry is batting .229 with 27 home runs and 69 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Ewell Russell of the Chicago White Sox established the record in 
1913. Valenzuela has 19 shutouts since his rookie season, but none since July 
16, 1987, when he beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Manager Russ Nixon of the Atlanta Braves, after Jack Clark of the 
San Diego Padres had hit two home runs against the Braves Monday night at 
Atlanta: "I thought the first one was going out of Fulton County -- not the 
stadium, the county."

DODGERS' MUNOZ GETS RUDE WELCOME; 
</P>
<P>
HIS FIRST MAJOR LEAGUE PITCH HIT FOR HOMER IN 9-5 LOSS TO REDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It happens every fall. Through the dust of a lost season a spotless young 
pitcher appears, making his major league debut with fresh fastballs and hopes. 
A couple of innings and raised eyebrows later, nobody can wait for spring. 
</P>
<P>
This happened to the Dodgers' Mike Munoz Wednesday night. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
In his first big league appearance, he took the Riverfront Stadium mound in the 
eighth inning with the Dodgers trailing the Cincinnati Reds, 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Jeff Richardson stepped up. Munoz reared back and threw. Richardson 
swung. There was a loud crack. 
</P>
<P>
Gone. A home run. On Munoz's first major league pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The ball disappeared over the left-field fence, Richardson rounded the bases, 
the crowd of 14,448 stood and cheered. Then Munoz did an interesting thing. He 
did not collapse. He did not cry. 
</P>
<P>
He kind of smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, man, it's kind of neat to hear all these people," he said. "I've 
never heard that kind of cheering before." 
</P>
<P>
Munoz then survived the rest of his debut, retiring the Reds without allowing 
another run as the Dodgers fell, 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
It was their second straight loss, with a second straight blown lead (5-3 in 
the sixth), again due to a poor performance by their middle relievers -- loser 
Ray Searage and Mike Morgan, who allowed three runs in 1 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
With this pattern having grown old two months ago, the Dodgers preferred to 
talk about something new and unusual -- Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came into the dugout after the inning, I shook his hand and 
congratulated him for hanging in there," fellow rookie Darrin Fletcher said. 
"He looked at me and sort of smirked. He's the kind of pitcher, this won't get 
him down." 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Munoz, recalled from triple-A Albuquerque Friday, had already 
proven that. 
</P>
<P>
After the homer, he threw a quick strike to Luis Quinones before retiring him 
on a fly out. He fell behind, 3 and 0, to Paul O'Neill before coming back with 
three straight strikes. Then he allowed a single to left field by Ken Griffey, 
who was thrown out attempting to take second base. 
</P>
<P>
And the Dodgers were impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"After the home run, I turned to Tim Crews and said, 'This is the important 
part, what happens now,' " pitcher John Wetteland said. "And you saw what he 
did. He took the ball and went right back after the batters. Some guys would 
have collapsed. Some guys would have been too scared." 
</P>
<P>
Munoz, 24, said he was helped by an interesting pep talk from catcher Mike 
Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
"After the home run, Scioscia ran out and was smiling," Munoz said. "He told 
me, 'Nice way to start a big league career. Now it's out of the way. So go 
after them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Munoz said he was then helped by hearing the debut recollections of various 
pitchers in the dugout, particularly Jay Howell. 
</P>
<P>
Recalled Howell: "I was with Cincinnati (in 1980), we were playing the Dodgers, 
we were down, 9-1, and on my first pitch . . . I hit Steve Garvey in the head. 
I thought, here I was, first pitch, and I killed a man. Tommy Lasorda ran out 
to me, and you can't print what he said. I thought there was going to be a 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
Said Munoz: "After hearing that from Jay, you feel a little better. That was 
the first first-pitch homer I've ever allowed, but I'm sure it's not going to 
be the last. As well as you pitch, you're always going to have problems. You 
just have to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned, you've got to have fun. That was the only problem with the home 
run -- it kind of took away from the fun." 
</P>
<P>
Munoz, former Bishop Amat High School and Cal Poly Pomona star who was 6-4 with 
a 3.08 ERA and six saves in 60 Albuquerque appearances, could be in the Dodger 
bullpen next season. And he could also take heart Wednesday that he wasn't the 
only Dodger pitcher who allowed a big home run. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing a streak of 24 scoreless innings into the game, Tim Belcher allowed a 
homer to his second batter, Luis Quinones. He survived to lead, 5-3, in the 
sixth before loading the bases with a couple of walks and a Mariano Duncan 
single. 
</P>
<P>
In came struggling left-hander Searage, who yielded a two-run single to 
pinch-hitter Barry Larkin to tie the game. Searage gave up a Griffey double and 
a walk to start the seventh; then Morgan entered and allowed a two-run, 
game-winning double to rookie Joe Oliver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall missed Wednesday's game with a stiff back, partially caused by 
the Dodgers' two long plane trips in the last four days. Of the 112 games for 
which Marshall has been eligible so far this year (when not on the disabled 
list), he has played in 95. . . . Mike Davis met with Dodger Manager Tom 
Lasorda before Wednesday's game to tell him he was ready to pinch-hit. Davis 
was promptly activated from the disabled list, where he has been since July 6 
due to arthroscopic surgery on both knees. "I still can't play the outfield, 
but I can sure hit, and that's enough," said Davis, batting .248 with five 
homers and 18 RBIs in 56 games. 
</P>
<P>
Orel Hershiser will miss both games of the Cincinnati series, as he flew home 
to Los Angeles Wednesday to prepare for Friday night's start in San Diego. 
Dodger pitchers normally fly ahead of the team a day before they are scheduled 
to pitch in another city. . . . The Riverfront Stadium scoreboard listed Mike 
Devereaux as the Dodger starting right fielder Wednesday. The Dodgers didn't 
appreciate the mistake, as Devereaux was traded to Baltimore this winter, where 
he has become the type of center fielder the Dodgers could use. 
</P>
<P>
The scene behind the batting cage before Wednesday's game was reminiscent of a 
family reunion, as ex-Dodgers Tim Leary and Mariano Duncan visited with their 
former teammates, while ex-Reds Kal Daniels and Lenny Harris did the same. "Do 
I miss the Dodgers? No way man," said Duncan, who is batting .263. "If you know 
what happened there, you know that's not a good question. I have so much fun 
here because I can play. With (Willie) Randolph and (Alfredo) Griffin over 
there, I may never play." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan is already showing the Reds his desire by playing shortstop with a 
pulled left hamstring. He was in the middle of the action Wednesday, as usual. 
He had a second-inning error that led to two Dodger runs, followed by a 
seventh-inning RBI single that helped clinch the Reds' win. Then afterward, 
despite his less-than-perfect command of English, he served as an interpreter 
for winning rookie pitcher Rosario Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
Leary, 2-6 with a 4.61 ERA for the Reds, was more stoic about the July 18 
trade. "I was upset for about an hour but then I realized, as long as I'm 
starting somewhere, it's fine," said Leary, who has been pitching with a 
strained ligament in the middle finger of his right hand. "After I won 17 games 
last year and got put in the bullpen for the postseason, I realized, how secure 
is my job? I learned over there to never take anything for granted." Leary said 
he is still not sure why he was removed from the Dodger rotation at the 
All-Star break despite a 3.18 ERA in 17 starts. "It's along the same lines of, 
why did they put Tim Belcher in the bullpen earlier, and what is Mike Morgan 
doing in the bullpen now?" Leary said. "You'll have to ask the manager. I just 
know I'm not the kind who can easily adjust to the bullpen."

Based on their statistics of a year ago, the Highlanders have one of the best 
returning skill-position packages in Southern California in receivers William 
Moringlane and Jermaine Love, running backs Leon Glasgow and Brett Washington, 
and senior quarterback Chris Gadomski. Bryan Martin, a junior transfer from 
Illinois, may unseat the incumbent Gadomski. Granada Hills (33-9-1 from 
1985-88) seems certain to win eight games or more. 
</P>
<P>
2 CANYON 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 11-3 
</P>
<P>
League: Golden 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Harry Welch 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Canyon was almost single-handedly beaten by Antelope Valley's 
Tommie Smith, who scored four touchdowns in the Southern Section Division II 
final. It may now be powerful tailback Chris Peery's turn to be a one-man 
wrecking crew for the Cowboys if he recovers from surgery to his groin area 
that he underwent Tuesday. Clint Beauer, a three-year letterman, could be the 
Valley-area's best receiver. This is a money team: Canyon has played in a 
divisional championship game four times in six years. 
</P>
<P>
3 SAN FERNANDO 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 8-4 
</P>
<P>
League: North Valley 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Tom Hernandez 
</P>
<P>
Judging by his preseason clippings, All-City Section selection Michael Wynn may 
be the team's most skilled quarterback since Anthony Davis (1968-70). Tailback 
Maurice McFarland, a three-year letterman, heads an explosive running game. But 
can the Tigers weather three Southern Section Division I teams (Fontana, Crespi 
and St. Paul) on the road in nonleague play? San Fernando plays only three home 
games and visits league-rival Granada Hills on Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
4 THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 6-4-1 
</P>
<P>
League: Marmonte 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bob Richards 
</P>
<P>
With eight starters returning on defense, the Lancers should be the class of 
the Marmonte League, even if the offense is as sporadic as it was in 1988. If 
the backfield situation is satisfactorily resolved -- juniors Scott Peterson 
and David Watts are in a dead heat at quarterback and tailback Mike Lindsay is 
recovering from knee surgery -- the Lancers could emerge as a contender for the 
Division II title. But defense, once again, will be T.O.'s primary M.O. Who 
needs finesse? 
</P>
<P>
5 HART 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 6-5 
</P>
<P>
League: Foothill 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mike Herrington 
</P>
<P>
Senior quarterback Rob Westervelt leads all returning Valley-area passers in 
yardage (2,130) and under the tutelage of the newly hired Herrington -- whose 
game plan will closely resemble that of pass-happy mentor Rick Scott, a former 
Hart coach -- the Indians should be burning up the airwaves at an ever greater 
pace. Howard Blackwell gives Hart balance and speed in the tailback position. 
</P>
<P>
6 ALEMANY 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 4-6 
</P>
<P>
League: Del Rey 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Pat Blackburn 
</P>
<P>
Three-year starter Joey Rosselli is the dean of Valley quarterbacks and 
possesses the best credentials among returning Del Rey League passers (1,559 
yards in '88). Receivers Scott Goldsmith, Billy Markowitz and Mark Dannemiller 
also return. Sophomore running back Terry Barnum is a barn-burner. If the 
defense holds up, a playoff berth seems realistic. Key games are with league 
foes Crespi and Loyola, which combined to thump Alemany, 84-0, last year and 
44-14 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
7 NOTRE DAME 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 8-3 
</P>
<P>
League: San Fernando Valley 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Kevin Rooney 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen starters are back from last season's league championship team and the 
Knights are ranked No. 2 in the Southern Section Division VII preseason poll. 
Returning starters include Greg Andrachick, who took over at quarterback in 
midseason, and running back Errol Small. The team's toughest test may be in 
finding enough regular-season competition to prepare for postseason play: After 
a 4-0 league season in '88, Notre Dame was bounced out of the playoffs in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
8 CHANNEL ISLANDS 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 8-3 
</P>
<P>
League: Marmonte 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Joel Gershon 
</P>
<P>
The two-time defending Marmonte League champions, who typically hammer 
opponents with a punishing ground attack, may air it out more often. 
Quarterback Mark Contreras, a three-year letterman, returns along with receiver 
Shawn Young, who led the team in receptions. It may come down to yet another 
race with defense-minded Thousand Oaks. Looking for suspense? Look elsewhere. 
Thousand Oaks and Channel Islands play in the league opener Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
9 MONTCLAIR PREP 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 6-5 
</P>
<P>
League: Alpha 
</P>
<P>
Coach: George Giannini 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness for transfers, and the Mounties have more of them that an RTD 
driver. Running back Derek Sparks and quarterback Leland Sparks -- they are 
cousins -- transferred to the school earlier this year and give the Mounties 
the most potent backfield in the area. Senior tailback Michael Jones, who 
gained 1,514 yards last season at Montclair Prep, is a bona fide Division I 
prospect. The Mounties are ranked No. 1 in the Division IX preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
10 ANTELOPE VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
1988 Record: 12-2 
</P>
<P>
League: Golden 
</P>
<P>
Coach: B. Newcomb 
</P>
<P>
The Antelopes are 83-28-1 in the 1980s and have won two Southern Section 
Division II titles, including last season's 28-22 win over league-rival Canyon. 
Yet Tommie Smith, perhaps the school's best player ever, graduated. The 
sophomore team has won one game in two seasons. Newcomb may have a hard time 
maintaining the Antelopes' recent high-desert high, but his program nonetheless 
remains one of the area's best.

BUZZ'S BOYS STAY CLOSE IN SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buzz Holcomb eagerly anticipated the 1989 high school football season when he 
embarked on his great experiment more than a year ago. But because of a 
personal tragedy, he probably never realized how important this season would 
become for him. 
</P>
<P>
Holcomb is the Westlake Village salesman who made news last year when he opened 
his home to a group of talented athletes from a disadvantaged neighborhood in 
Pacoima. The boys had played on the same youth track and football teams in the 
San Fernando Valley with Holcomb's son Erik. 
</P>
<P>
Rival coaches charged Holcomb with recruiting, and Southern Section 
Commissioner Stan Thomas claimed Holcomb broke the spirit of the section's 
anti-recruiting rule. But Thomas took no action against him, acknowledging that 
Holcomb was helping the young athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Erik Holcomb, Brian Brison and Mukasa Crowe entered Westlake High last 
fall as ninth graders without athletic eligibility because of academic 
deficiencies and missed the football season. Leonice Brown and Ontiwaun Carter, 
who also had lived with the Holcombs, played on the varsity teams as sophomores 
at Crespi and Kennedy, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Buzz's "boys" will play varsity football at five different 
schools. Erik has remained at Westlake and is the only wide receiver in the 
bunch. The other four are running backs. Carter, who rushed for 1,190 yards 
last season, returns to Kennedy and Brown is back at Crespi. Brison will start 
at defensive back at Alemany and will share playing time at tailback with the 
Indians' other dazzling sophomore, Terry Barnum. Crowe has enrolled at 
Chatsworth through the Permits With Transportation program in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District and will share the tailback position for the 
Chancellors. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got so many kids to read about this year," Holcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Holcomb's nephew, Jeff Burdick, is a wide receiver and defensive 
back at Chaminade, and Brad Gossen, a close friend of the family and a Westlake 
graduate, is Washington State's starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Holcomb needs the distraction of a busy football schedule and a horde of boys 
to root for. He claims it's the best therapy to help him deal with the loss of 
his child. Mike Holcomb, a former football player and track athlete at 
Westlake, died in a car accident in March. An autopsy revealed that Mike, 20, 
was legally drunk when the car he was driving careened out of control and 
crashed into a telephone pool on Thousand Oaks Boulevard in Agoura Hills. Also 
killed in the crash was Mike's girlfriend, Michelle Sinclair. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the greatest loss any man can have," Holcomb said. "Football is really 
going to help me through this time. The kids have been so good to me since 
Michael's death. You know, a lot of people think these kids from Pacoima are 
supposed to be such tough, bad (guys) but they've really been thoughtful and 
kind." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacoima youths visit Westlake regularly and still hold a special affection 
for Buzz. Mike's death has cemented that bond. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard about his death, that really ripped me up. It tore me apart," 
Brison said. "I get out to Westlake about once a month. Buzz is a close 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
Holcomb wishes the Pacoima youths still lived with him, citing the eligibility 
battle with the Southern Section as the chief reason the boys moved out. Carter 
had moved back to Pacoima last summer, and after Brown enrolled at Crespi, he 
moved in with Russell White, a former Celt running back now at Cal. Brown is 
the half brother of former Rams running back Charles White and is Russell's 
uncle. 
</P>
<P>
Brison and Crowe left the Holcombs just after Christmas, saying they felt both 
homesick and unwelcome at Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that everyone looked at it as recruiting," Holcomb said. "I was 
just interested in what was best for the boys. I can understand how everyone 
saw it as something else, but it's sad they didn't see it for what it was." 
</P>
<P>
Holcomb claims he holds no animosity toward the Southern Section, a stand made 
easier by the fact that everything has worked out well for the boys, who take a 
similar position. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I'm doing so well at Alemany, I don't think about it much," Brison 
said. "I have no resentment. It's all behind me. I'm starting a new career 
Friday night." 
</P>
<P>
The intent to provide a better environment for kids is a good one, Holcomb 
said, but he has questioned that impulse since the death of his son. 
</P>
<P>
"The boys would still be at my house if there wasn't that problem with the 
Southern Section," he said. "The irony for me is that I wanted the boys to see 
what the good life is all about. But after they left, their brother Mike 
wrapped himself around a tree. I wanted to offer protection for these boys and 
I couldn't even provide it for my own son." 
</P>
<P>
Where they are now: 
</P>
<P>
ONTIWAUN CARTER 
</P>
<P>
The first of the Holcomb bunch to establish himself, Carter (5-11, 175) was the 
Valley-area's top sophomore and one of the area's best backs last year. He 
rushed for 1,190 yards and caught 13 passes for 184 yards for Kennedy. "He 
electrified people last year," Kennedy Coach Bob Francola said. And Francola 
expects more fireworks this season. "He's bigger and stronger this year," he 
said. "You're going to see a running back nearly as good as Russell White. He 
has great speed and he's tough." 
</P>
<P>
MUKASA CROWE 
</P>
<P>
Crowe also endured a personal tragedy this summer. The ensuing personal 
problems he felt in the wake of the death of his grandmother kept him off the 
practice field much of the summer. But Chatsworth Coach Myron Gibford is 
willing to be patient. Crowe (5-11, 175) has been impressive since the start of 
two-a-day drills this week. "We expect great things from him," Gibford said. 
"He has great acceleration and can run with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
BRIAN BRISON 
</P>
<P>
Alemany Coach Pat Blackburn calls Brison the team's top defensive back and a 
punishing runner. Brison packs 180 pounds on a 5-7 frame and he timed 10.9 in 
the 100 meters last year as a freshman. "When he breaks into the open and you 
try to tackle him, you pay for it," Blackburn said. Brison will share playing 
time in the backfield with Terry Barnum, who scored 28 touchdowns for the 
freshman team last year. 
</P>
<P>
LEONICE BROWN 
</P>
<P>
Brown gained all of 22 yards last year as a backup to Russell White and then 
missed summer workouts to improve his grades. He attended summer school at 
Montclair Prep to wipe out a failing mark and showed up for one workout at San 
Fernando. He has returned to Crespi a little out of shape but is still a 
prospect. "He's talented, has very good speed and is making great cuts in 
practice," Crespi Coach Tim Lins said. Brown will compete with Lucas Freeman at 
tailback. 
</P>
<P>
ERIK HOLCOMB 
</P>
<P>
The only wide receiver of the group, Holcomb will get a world of action his 
first year on the Westlake varsity. The 6-0, 155-pound sophomore will start on 
offense and in the defensive secondary and will return punts. "If he comes off 
the field the whole season, I'll be surprised," Coach Jim Benkert said. "He's 
been very impressive. He catches everything and he's a sure tackler."

INFORMAL POLL OF RECRUITING SERVICES PRODUCES LIST OF TOP 22 FOOTBALL PROSPECTS 
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In discussing the high school football talent pool in Southern California this 
year, scout Dick Lascola admits that it is not a bumper crop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as bad as some (years) but not as good as others," says Lascola, who 
operates the Fallbrook-based Scouting Evaluation Assn. 
</P>
<P>
He says it doesn't match the talent supply of last season when seniors such as 
running backs Russell White of Crespi, quarterback Curtis Conway of Hawthorne, 
offensive lineman Bob Whitfield of Banning and defensive lineman Marcellous 
Elder of Long Beach Poly were considered among the premier college prospects in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But "there's still quality out there," Lascola said. 
</P>
<P>
He sees quality at linebacker and quarterback while the ranks appear thin among 
defensive backs and offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly the best overall prospect is linebacker Bruce Walker of Compton 
Dominguez. "There are some who think that Walker is the best player in the 
state, and others say he's the best in the country," Lascola said. 
</P>
<P>
Linebackers Willie McGinest of Long Beach Poly and Nkosi Littleton of Carson 
and quarterback Charles Levy of Lynwood also have drawn attention from major 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lascola, The Times turned to national recruiting services such 
as G &amp; W Recruiting Report of Pennsylvania, Tom Lemming's Prep Football 
Report of Illinois, Houston-based scout Max Emfinger, Super Prep magazine of 
Costa Mesa and the Florida-based Steve Smith's Blue Chip Report to determine 
which Greater Los Angeles and Orange County seniors are receiving national 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat, Mater Dei and Long Beach Poly lead the way with two players apiece 
on the list. 
</P>
<P>
Here, in no particular order, are the Terrific 22: 
</P>
<P>
* Michael Wynn (San Fernando, quarterback) -- San Fernando has been known more 
for running backs over the years, but Wynn is in the spotlight this season. 
Wynn passed for 1,614 yards last season. Emfinger ranked him No. 2 nationally 
among quarterback prospects. Wynn (6-foot-3, 210 pounds) runs the 40-yard dash 
in 4.6 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
* Todd Gragnano (Los Alamitos, quarterback) -- Perhaps the most touted 
quarterback in the Southland, Gragnano (6-1, 185) earned his reputation with an 
impressive junior season in which he passed for 2,324 yards and 15 touchdowns. 
He has a strong arm, a quick release and is mobile in the pocket. Super Prep 
compares him with former Orange County standout Bret Johnson of UCLA. He also 
plays baseball and is an excellent student. 
</P>
<P>
* Dan O'Neil (Mater Dei, quarterback) -- Regarded as one of the top prospects 
on the West Coast, O'Neil is certainly one of the most accurate passers. As a 
junior he completed 58% of his attempts, passing for 2,100 yards and 18 
touchdowns. He's 6-2, 185, reads defenses well and rushed for 350 yards last 
season. An all-around athlete, O'Neil also placekicks and plays basketball and 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
* J.J. O'Laughlin (Glendora, quarterback) -- When scouts talk about O'Laughlin, 
they usually speak of his potential. "He has all the tools to be a good one," 
Lascola says. Super Prep ranks him No. 6 among quarterbacks on its All-American 
team. He is a pure dropback quarterback with outstanding arm strength and a 
nice touch. O'Laughlin (6-3, 200) passed for 1,465 yards last season and has 
nearly 3,000 in his career. He also plays baseball and basketball and has a 3.9 
grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
* Charles Levy (Lynwood, quarterback) -- This year's version of Curtis Conway, 
who starred for Hawthorne last season, Levy is a quarterback who plays like a 
running back. An all-around athlete, he can pass but is regarded more for his 
dangerous running. Levy (6-1, 180) has brilliant speed -- 4.5 seconds in the 40 
-- and exceptional moves. He piled up 2,400 all-purpose yards last season. 
Lascola projects him as an option quarterback in college and others project him 
as a defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
* Michael Jones (Montclair Prep, running back) -- In discussing Jones, scouts 
use the words power and speed. Jones (6-2, 210) can bench press 315 pounds and 
he runs the 40 in 4.5. He has great vision and knows how to sidestep a tackler. 
He rushed for 1,514 yards and 17 touchdowns as a junior. While his future may 
be at running back, scouts also think he could play safety or linebacker in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
* Marshawn Thompson (La Puente Bassett, running back) -- Bassett has never had 
a reputation for producing major-college prospects and scouts had reservations 
about Thompson. But he may have erased any doubt by rushing for 1,717 yards and 
16 touchdowns in 301 carries last year. Thompson (6-1, 200) runs the 40 in 4.6 
and, as Super Prep says, "He looks slower than he is." 
</P>
<P>
* Chris Peery (Canyon, running back) -- For sheer power running, it would be 
difficult to find a better back than Peery (6-1, 216). He takes full advantage 
of his great leg strength and a solid upper body to punish opponents. He 
bench-presses 315 pounds. But Peery also has speed -- 4.6 in the 40 -- to break 
away from tacklers and displays good moves for his size. A starter since his 
freshman year, he rushed for 1,418 yards and 22 touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
* Jerome Casey (Sylmar, running back) -- Speed makes Casey a prime attraction 
among college scouts. Casey (6-0, 180) has above-average strength. It's just 
that scouts tend to notice his breakaway speed first. He runs the 40 in a 
blazing 4.4 and is effective both as an inside and outside runner. He is also 
an outstanding long jumper. 
</P>
<P>
* Jeremy Smith (Bishop Amat, wide receiver) -- Lemming labels Smith "a high 
school superstar," and you will not find much disagreement among other scouts. 
As a junior he caught 82 passes for 1,002 yards and nine touchdowns and 
returned two punts for scores. Smith (5-11, 185) possesses 4.5 speed in the 40, 
runs excellent pass patterns and has great hands. 
</P>
<P>
* Kevin Copeland (Dorsey, wide receiver) -- If Smith is the best wide receiver 
in the Southland, Copeland is not far behind. Said Lascola: "They don't get 
much better. He's one of the tops around." He is definitely one of the fastest 
with a best of 10.6 in the 100 meters. Copeland (6-0, 170) runs pinpoint 
patterns and is a constant deep threat. 
</P>
<P>
* Elic Mahone (Muir, tight end) -- Mahone is a physical specimen at 6-5, 220 
pounds. He also possesses good hands and speed of 4.5 in the 40 -- outstanding 
for a tight end. Mahone also plays defensive end, although he wants to play 
offense in college. Mahone, a brilliant leaper, has cleared 6-5 in the high 
jump. Off the field, he has a steady 3.3 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
* Jason Green (Bishop Amat, tight end) -- Talk about double trouble. With Smith 
and Green, Bishop Amat will pose a nightmare for secondaries. Green (6-3, 220) 
presents match-up problems for defenses because of his size and 4.6 speed. He 
has soft hands and is an exceptional leaper, which he demonstrated on the 
basketball team last season. He caught 41 passes for 656 yards and eight 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
* Chris Andresen (Warren, offensive lineman) -- Regarded as one of the top 
offensive line prospects in the nation by most scouts, Andresen combines great 
size and strength with above-average quickness. He is 6-4, 285 and bench 
presses 400 pounds. Emfinger lists him as the nation's No. 1 prospect at 
offensive guard. 
</P>
<P>
* Ryan Motherway (Mater Dei, offensive lineman) -- Mater Dei has produced 
several outstanding line prospects in the last two seasons, but scouts think 
Motherway (6-4, 255) may be best. Lascola calls him the top offensive line 
prospect in the area. He plays end on the defensive line and excels in 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
* Justin Yarro (Loyola, offensive lineman) -- At a school that always seems to 
produce an abundance of college prospects, At 6-4, 250, scouts say he has a 
future as an offensive guard. 
</P>
<P>
* Keith Navidi (Esperanza, defensive lineman) -- Navidi (6-6, 255) runs the 40 
in 5.0. Regarded for his aggressiveness and pass rushing, Lascola calls him the 
best defensive line prospect in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
* Bruce Walker (Dominguez, linebacker) -- In the eyes of scouts, Walker may be 
the best prospect in the state at any position. Emfinger gives him the highest 
rating of any player in the nation at 9.99 out of 10. Lemming calls him "a holy 
terror on defense with great football instincts." Walker (6-4, 235) has 4.5 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
* Willie McGinest (Long Beach Poly, linebacker) -- Another formidable prospect 
in a talent-laden position, McGinest (6-6, 220 pounds) has been viewed by some 
scouts as the top senior linebacker in the state. With speed, McGinest has the 
size, speed, aggressiveness and instincts to be an impact player in college. He 
is a strong student with a 3.9 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
* Nkosi Littleton (Carson, linebacker) -- He is not as physically imposing as 
Walker or McGinest, but Littleton usually leaves an imprint on opponents. Super 
Prep describes him as "this year's killer defender." Lemming calls him "a 
hitter from the word go." At 6-2 and 210, he may need a little more bulk for 
college. 
</P>
<P>
* Jason Jones (Long Beach Poly, defensive back) -- At first glance, Jones may 
appear small to be a major-college prospect. However, the 5-10 and 175 
cornerback makes up for any size disadvantage with other attributes. He has 
outstanding instincts and blazing 4.5 speed. 
</P>
<P>
* Errol Small (Notre Dame, running back-defensive back) -- One of the better 
all-around athletes on the squad, Small has stood out in basketball and 
football. In football, his future is probably as a safety. Lascola thinks he is 
one of the best defensive backs in the Southland. He is a hard hitter, tough 
against the run and strong on pass coverage. Small (6-2, 210) has 4.6 speed and 
the ability to excel at running back.

VERES RESIGNS AS COACH OF TROUBLED OAK PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following a meeting with school administrators, Ron Veres resigned Wednesday as 
football and baseball coach at Oak Park High. 
</P>
<P>
Veres, a 48-year old walk-on coach, met with Principal Jeff Chancer and 
Athletic Director Fred Yamano to discuss the shortage of players on the Oak 
Park roster. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries had reduced the roster from 19 to eight players and Veres feared he 
would not be able to field a team for Friday's opener against Boron. 
</P>
<P>
Yamano and Chancer had said Tuesday they were unaware of a roster problem. 
</P>
<P>
After a one-hour meeting with the two administrators, Veres cancelled team 
practice and informed his six assistant coaches that he was resigning. He later 
handed a resignation note to Yamano that read: "I resign my position as head 
football coach, effective immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Veres later read a statement from his home in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time in one's life when you have to stand up for principles you 
believe in," Veres said. "There exists some philosophical differences between 
the administration and myself and at this time these differences are 
irreconcilable. I find it extremely difficult to be an effective influence on 
the football program at Oak Park." 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park had an 0-9-1 record in 1986 before Veres took over the program. In two 
years, he compiled a 17-6 record and guided the Eagles to consecutive 
appearances in the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best coach I've ever had," said Jess Garner, an assistant coach who 
played the past two seasons under Veres. "He was a perfectionist and strived 
for perfection in his players. He gave all the knowledge I needed to be a good 
player and coach." 
</P>
<P>
Yamano and Roger Newell, an Oak Park assistant last season, are expected to run 
the team until a successor can be found. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to field a team for Friday," Yamano said. "The team captains 
voluntarily came to inform me that they will continue to prepare for the game."

PEERY RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Canyon High tailback Chris Peery, who underwent emergency urological surgery 
Tuesday night, was released Wednesday morning from Valley Presbyterian Hospital 
in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Peery, the Cowboys' celebrated senior tailback, is expected to miss at least 
the first four weeks of the season while recovering from what a hospital 
spokeswoman said was a non-football injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little sore," Peery said. "I'm not up to walking around yet." 
</P>
<P>
Peery, however, said that there was "no doubt" he will play this season and 
that he will attend Canyon's opener against Hart on Friday night at College of 
the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"In a week-and-a-half or two weeks I can start lifting weights," Peery said. 
"But I still gotta talk to the doctor. He wants me to get a lot of rest. That's 
more important than football right now." VINCE KOWALICK

UAL CHAIRMAN TRIES TO GET SUPPORT FOR BUYOUT OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stephen M. Wolf, chairman of UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, met with 
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner in Washington on Wednesday in an 
effort to win support for a $6.5-billion employee-management buyout. 
</P>
<P>
A Transportation Department spokesman described the meeting as a "listening 
session" and said Skinner made no commitments to Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner has said he is concerned that debt-financed airline buyouts could put 
airlines in financial trouble, jeopardizing safety. The department cannot block 
a takeover outright but can lift an airline's certificate to operate if it 
believes that safety has been compromised. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were indications that a new bid might emerge for UAL. A Wall 
Street source said a second European airline is exploring a bid in conjunction 
with an American partner. The source could not provide more details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for Partners 
</P>
<P>
British Airways is involved in the employee bid for the airline and has agreed 
to contribute $750 million in exchange for UAL preferred stock. The other known 
bidder is Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis, who has said he might pay more 
than his current offer of $300 a share after reviewing the airline's financial 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, according to a source familiar with the situation, is negotiating with 
UAL over the terms of a confidentiality agreement that would allow him to see 
the company's books. In addition, Davis is looking for equity partners to help 
finance his offer for the airline. Davis, according to the source, is 
approaching foreign airlines, among other possible contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law provides that no more than 25% of a U.S. airline may be owned by 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Mentioned as possible bidders for a stake in UAL were Japan Air Lines, Air 
France and Lufthansa German Airlines. Lufthansa on Wednesday announced that it 
plans to raise the equivalent of $478 million by selling stock to its existing 
shareholders. The sale would reduce the West German government's stake in the 
airline to 52% from 65%. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, a spokeswoman for Lufthansa said the airline does not plan to 
invest in UAL with the money raised from the stock sale. "However, Lufthansa's 
position is that if we were approached by Marvin Davis or someone else, we 
would be happy to listen," Lucille Hoshabjian said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is expected to court United's machinists union, which has reacted coolly 
to the proposed employee buyout. In a statement Tuesday, John Peterpaul, 
general vice president of the International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace 
Workers, said he was skeptical about United's ability to survive with the 
additional debt needed to finance the proposed buyout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Value of Deal Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Peterpaul said his union believes that a debt-financed transaction would 
"jeopardize the future of the carrier and safety of the traveling public" and 
said the Transportation Department should discourage any airline takeover that 
involves large amounts of debt. 
</P>
<P>
Peterpaul said additionally that the machinists union does not think that UAL 
is worth $300 a share. He said the union's analysis shows that it is worth $195 
to $240 a share. "Furthermore, we believe no transaction is necessary to 
protect employees against the purported risk of a takeover," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts said that lack of the machinists' support could hurt 
the proposed employee bid. These analysts said the machinists, who earn 
substantially less than pilots, are no doubt reluctant to grant wage or 
productivity concessions to help finance a buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Though the pilots said they can finance the transaction without machinists' 
participation, analysts said a lack of support from the machinists might make 
it harder to finance the employee buyout. United's flight attendants, 
meanwhile, are talking to the pilots about the possibility of joining the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Price Slips 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts said Wednesday that they doubt that the 
Transportation Department would try to prevent a takeover, although they said 
the department might later place restrictions on the airline if it ran into 
financial trouble. "They can't block a transaction just because they don't like 
it," said Robert Decker, an analyst with the investment firm of Duff &amp; 
Phelps in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the takeover speculation of recent weeks, UAL stock has shot up, but it 
fell $3.875 on Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange trading to close at 
$286.875.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: GENETIC MAPS LEADING US INTO UNKNOWN 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TERRITORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Schrage 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most maps can tell you where you are and which way to go; gene maps can tell 
you which way you'll probably die. The question is, do you really want to know? 
</P>
<P>
For the price of a Rand McNally World Atlas, you will soon be able to learn 
what your body has in store for you. A few drops of blood, a whirl in a 
centrifuge and the right enzyme cocktail are the necessary ingredients to cut 
and paste your double helix into a detailed map of the body's design. These 
maps reveal where the design may be ruinously flawed. 
</P>
<P>
Genetic cartographers already chart genes for potential parents worried about 
passing on such diseases as Tay-Sachs and sickle-cell anemia to their 
offspring. But what of individuals who have already inherited their genetic 
time bombs? This is emerging as the new focus of this diagnostic technology. 
Gene markers can determine with near certainty whether an individual has 
inherited specific illnesses -- most notably, Huntington's chorea, a 
particularly debilitating way to die -- decades before any symptoms appear. As 
scientists map the new world of the human genome, we'll be hearing monthly 
announcements from researchers around the world trumpeting their latest 
discoveries of gene-linked disease -- for example, the recent discovery of the 
gene for cystic fibrosis. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are doing research are quite right to say that new markers will 
be identified," says Dr. Neil A. Holtzman, a professor of pediatrics and 
epidemiology at Johns Hopkins who has written extensively on genetic testing. 
"These markers will give us tremendous new insights into the genetic makeup of 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
The potential list is both awesome and depressing. Colon cancers, lung cancers 
and breast cancers? Almost certainly. Cardiovascular illness? High probability. 
Mental illnesses such as manic depression and schizophrenia? Quite likely. 
Alzheimer's? Possibly. These may well be diseases you will inherit no matter 
what you do. There are no preventive measures. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, says Holtzman, gene maps may chart probability, not destiny. The 
map may reveal a 40% probability that you'll get pancreatic cancer or an 80% 
chance for cancer of the uterus. If you're lucky, you'll live longer. On the 
other hand, you may be able to escape your genetic susceptibility by managing 
your life style better: Stop smoking, eat more vegetables and the statistics 
that indicate your genetic propensity for a heart attack could drop to 3 in 10 
from 8 in 10. 
</P>
<P>
"We will clearly know how to detect those genetic predispositions," says 
Holtzman, "and this will worry some people to death. Unfortunately, we will 
have the ability to predict long before the ability to intervene. While 
physicians are accustomed to treating people with an overt disease, they really 
aren't prepared to sit down with someone and discuss probabilities. Physicians 
may have to be retooled to deal with this." 
</P>
<P>
But, given the chance, do people really want to know their odds? In the case of 
Huntington's chorea, fewer than half of the hundreds of people eligible for the 
test chose to take it. They didn't want to know. (Similarly, most people in 
high-risk AIDS categories decline to be tested.) The pain of ambiguity is 
easier to handle than the risk of certainty. 
</P>
<P>
"The need for intense counseling is quite extreme," says Nancy S. Wexler, 
president of the Santa Monica-based Hereditary Disease Foundation. "There's 
this fantasy that a lot of these people have that knowing would resolve a lot 
of problems in their relationships. But even if Huntington's goes away as an 
issue, they will still have their problems." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington's chorea is an extreme case. But how would one's life change given 
the knowledge of how you are most likely to die? Will the proliferation of this 
new technology augur in a new era of fatalism? How will this explosion of 
personal knowledge change our most intimate relationships? 
</P>
<P>
Should a fiancee insist on seeing a gene map before signing the prenuptial 
agreement? What happens to a marriage when the gene map says the husband has a 
90% chance of having a crippling stroke in the next five years? Or that the 
wife will have a fatal leukemia? 
</P>
<P>
Is getting a gene map of your 5-year-old the best thing to do? What if the 
child's map proves bleak? When do you tell him? Wexler tells of one 
Huntington's couple that gave marker data to one child but not to another 
because "they didn't think he could handle it." 
</P>
<P>
What if one tests positive? Is every single twinge and ache interpreted as the 
onset of the crippling disease? The ready availability of this technology may 
create a painful new self-consciousness about human frailty and mortality. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, millions of smokers blithely puff away with nary a care 
about the possible consequences. Maybe all this gene-linked data will be more 
numbing than enlightening, further desensitizing an already stressed-out 
population. 
</P>
<P>
But what's most likely, I think, is a tremendous surge in the number of support 
groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and the social network of AIDS volunteers, 
a flocking to religion and a dramatic rise in the counseling business. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're talking about is astronomical," says John Fletcher, an 
Episcopalian minister and bioethicist with the University of Virginia School of 
Medicine. "What you're going to see is a lot of entrepreneurial activity in new 
screening and counseling services. We're not yet ready for the explosion that 
gene mapping is going to bring."

U.S. CAR, TRUCK SALES LEAP IN LATE AUGUST

<TEXT>
<P>
Car and truck sales in the United States soared 21.4% in late August compared 
to last year as customers took advantage of end-of-the-model-year sales and 
looming price increases, the auto makers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
For the entire month, with import sales included, car and truck sales rose 8.4% 
compared to August of last year. Domestic vehicles showed a significant gain. 
</P>
<P>
Vehicles made by the eight major U.S. auto makers sold at an average rate of 
49,276 a day during the Aug. 21-31 period this year, compared to a daily rate 
of 40,578 during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic car sales were up 22.6%, and truck sales were up 19.4% in late August. 
For the month, domestic vehicle sales were up 13.1%, while import car and truck 
sales were down 4.8%. 
</P>
<P>
August was a good month to buy cars. Typically, dealers offer special deals as 
the model year draws to a close, traditionally on Sept. 30. Besides that, 
manufacturers have been offering customers and dealers incentives that lower 
the prices of 1989 cars. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers also were told that prices for 1990 cars would be going up, prompting 
some to buy now rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers have been bombarded by these price hikes on the 1990 models going up 
anywhere from 2% to 9%," said analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. 
International of New York. "Domestic auto makers haven't done that in a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's people out there thinking, 'I've got to buy a car by the end of the 
year,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Adcox, owner of Adcox Chevrolet in Chattanooga, Tenn., said he's seen some 
increased traffic through his showroom recently, and incentives are the reason.

PRODUCTIVITY RATE REBOUNDS IN QUARTER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American workers posted a modest productivity improvement in the second quarter 
of the year with significant gains by factory workers leading the way, the 
government said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said productivity in the non-farm portion of the economy 
rebounded at a revised annual rate of 0.7% in the April-June period, up from 
the 0.2% gain reported in preliminary data last month and much better than the 
1.3% decline in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The department said unit labor costs -- a key inflation indicator -- increased 
at an annual rate of 4.9% in the quarter, down from the 6.2% jump reported for 
the first quarter but nonetheless a sign of persistent underlying inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the small productivity gain was consistent with the recent 
slowing of the economy's growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
But they said poor performance in the non-financial corporate sector -- a 
category including most service industries, in which productivity fell and 
labor costs rose at a rapid 11.1% annual rate -- suggested that inflation was 
still around. 
</P>
<P>
"The future in overall productivity growth is not encouraging" because the 
service-producing sector makes up roughly 80% of the economy, said Allen Sinai, 
chief economist for Boston Co. Economic Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Output Increases 
</P>
<P>
"The 0.7% increase is a low number but consistent with the cyclical problems 
that typically occur as growth slows down," said economist Roger Brinner of 
DRI-McGraw Hill. "Employers are reluctant to trim their work force so that when 
the economy downshifts you have to expect a dip in productivity growth." 
</P>
<P>
The second-quarter improvement came as output grew at an annual rate of 2.4% 
while hours worked expanded by 1.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Gains in productivity -- output per hours worked -- are seen as vital to 
economic growth at times of near full employment and tight labor markets in 
skilled jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Improved productivity in manufacturing also helps U.S. competitiveness in world 
markets. Workers in manufacturing posted a productivity gain of 2.9% at an 
annual rate in the second quarter, up from the 2.4% increase reported in the 
preliminary data. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 5.6% in 
the quarter, but consumer inflation continued to more than erase the wage 
gains. Real hourly compensation -- hourly compensation minus consumer inflation 
-- fell 0.7%, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary data had put the hourly compensation increase at an annual rate 
of 5.5% and the decline in real wages at 0.9%. In the first quarter, hourly 
compensation rose at an annual rate of 4.8% and real wages declined 0.6%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lean and Mean' Sector 
</P>
<P>
The 2.9% annual rate productivity gain in manufacturing in the second quarter 
followed a 2.1% gain in the January-March period. Unit labor costs in 
manufacturing fell at an annual rate of 0.4% after increasing at an annual rate 
of 1.0% in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lean and mean manufacturing sector," said Sinai. "This is really 
something to cheer about in the continued strong performance in productivity 
and cost control in the manufacturing sector." 
</P>
<P>
The second-quarter manufacturing gain came as output rose at an annual rate of 
2.9%. The number of hours worked held steady after rising at an annual rate of 
1.1% in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Factory workers saw their real wages fall at an annual rate of 3.7% in the 
second quarter, with inflation stripping away an increase of 2.4%, at an annual 
rate, in hourly compensation in manufacturing, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
A separate figure that includes the farm sector of the economy showed that 
productivity rose at an annual rate of 1.3%, as output climbed 1.9% while hours 
worked rose by 0.6%. The report attributed that gain to improved productivity 
by farm workers.

U.S. Employment Outlook Dims: Fewer U.S. companies plan to increase hiring in 
the final quarter of 1989 than the previous year, largely because of softness 
in the Northeast, a survey of U.S. firms has found. The survey, conducted by 
temporary employment agency Manpower Inc., found that 26% of nearly 14,000 
employers questioned by telephone planned to increase hiring from October 
through December, down from 28% in 1988. Companies in the Northeast had the 
least ambitious hiring plans, with 22% saying they would add to their staff, a 
seven-year low, compared to 27% last year.

BAT Hearings Set for Next Week: Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers said 
it will hold a hearing next week to decide whether Sir James Goldsmith's 
Hoylake Investments Ltd. can extend its $21.4-billion hostile bid for BAT 
Industries PLC beyond the normal 60-day deadline. A ruling on an extension 
would be pivotal to the outcome of the 13.4 billion-pound hostile offer for the 
British conglomerate, analysts said. In a related development, AXA-MIDI 
Assurances of France said it filed applications in nine states, including 
California, to acquire Los Angeles-based Farmers Group Inc. Last week, AXA said 
that it would purchase Farmers for $4.5 billion upon conditions being 
satisfied, including Hoylake's bid for BAT being successful and the approval of 
insurance regulators.

WPPSS Settlement Approved: Six years after the nation's largest municipal bond 
default, U.S. District Judge William D. Browning of Tucson has approved 
settlements to allow $750 million to be distributed to holders of Washington 
Public Power Supply System bonds. Browning, who presided over the WPPSS 
litigation, filed a 106-page opinion approving settlements reached in the past 
year between Chemical Bank and defendants in the case. Chemical Bank is trustee 
for the bondholders. In 1983, WPPSS defaulted on $2.25 billion in bonds that it 
had sold to finance construction of two nuclear power plants in Washington.

MAZDA REALIGNS MANAGEMENT AT OFFICE IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mazda Motor of America said Wednesday that it has realigned management at the 
company's corporate headquarters in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring is intended to make the company more responsive to Mazda 
dealers and customers by streamlining operations, said spokesman Al Goldberg. 
"It's management fine-tuning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The realignment follows a major reorganization at Mazda 14 months ago, when the 
company centralized its U.S. sales operations in Irvine. At the time, Irvine 
was the regional office for 31 Central and Western states, with other regional 
importing and sales offices in Jacksonville, Fla., and Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's restructuring, the three offices were consolidated into one in 
Irvine, called Mazda Motor of America Inc., which is responsible for importing, 
marketing and selling Mazdas in the United States through its 844 dealers. 
After that consolidation, Mazda Motor of America still had separate groups for 
operations and for sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easier to Communicate 
</P>
<P>
The changes announced this week are "the next step," basically eliminating 
those two groups, Goldberg said. In their place is a new Operations Group, 
which includes most of the functions of the former two groups. 
</P>
<P>
The new structure "will make it easier to communicate with dealers primarily," 
Goldberg said. "Now everything is under one responsibility -- rather than two 
separate groups with different management." 
</P>
<P>
George McCabe, formerly group vice president-sales and marketing, has been 
named group vice president-operations. His duties include the firm's five 
regional offices, sales operations, dealer development and advertising. That 
gives McCabe responsibility for more than half of Mazda's 1,152 employees in 
the Irvine headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
McCabe joined Mazda in 1974 as a district sales manager in the New York area. 
He progressed steadily through the company's ranks. Before joining Mazda, he 
was with the Chrysler Corp.

PEOPLE: MCKESSON CEO RESIGNS AFTER BOARD DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman and chief executive of McKesson Corp. has abruptly resigned from 
the $7-billion drug and health-care distribution company after a disagreement 
with the board. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Field Jr. resigned "because of differences with the board over 
management philosophy and the future direction of the company," the firm said 
in a brief statement. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said Field submitted his resignation at a regularly 
scheduled board meeting in San Francisco. The spokesman would not elaborate on 
Field's differences with the board and had no comment on whether his 
resignation was requested. 
</P>
<P>
Field could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Field, 55, joined McKesson in 1984 as president and chief operating officer. In 
July, 1986, he was named president and chief executive, and in July, 1988, he 
assumed the duties of chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Harlan, Field's predecessor as chairman from 1979 to 1988, was elected 
chairman and chief executive on an interim basis in the wake of Field's 
resignation, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, Field oversaw much of a corporate restructuring begun under 
Harlan that refocused McKesson on its core drug and general merchandise 
distribution businesses. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the company sold all of its wine, spirits and liquor businesses. 
Earlier this year, it signed an agreement to sell its veterinary products 
distribution division to a division of Colgate-Palmolive Co. for an undisclosed 
sum. 
</P>
<P>
In the first fiscal quarter ended June 30, McKesson reported a 3.9% increase in 
earnings to $24 million, or 57 cents a share, but earnings from continuing 
operations were flat. Sales grew to $1.49 billion from $1.35 billion in the 
same quarter of 1988.

CRITIC AT LARGE: RAUL JULIA'S ARCHBISHOP ROMERO: A HERO, A SAINT AND A HUMAN 
BEING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The range of roles an actor plays, especially a fine character actor like Raul 
Julia, is always bemusing, sometimes amazing, to contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
Julia has perhaps most famously been a prisoner confined to a cell with a 
flamboyant gay (in "Kiss of the Spider Woman"). He has with equal intensity 
been a murderous hairdresser (in "The Morning After"), a corrupt 
drug-enforcement official ("Tequila Sunrise"), the schemer behind the 
dictator's throne ("Moon Over Parador") and Macheath (in a forthcoming film 
version of "The Threepenny Opera"). 
</P>
<P>
Now he is the martyred Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador in "Romero," the 
ambitious and precedent-creating feature film produced by Father Ellwood Kieser 
and financed in part by the Paulist order. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the auspices, Julia insisted during a recent brief visit to Los 
Angeles: "It's important to make clear this is not a Catholic film. It's about 
a human being who grew. The archbishop evolved from an ordinary and quite timid 
person to a great popular hero. 
</P>
<P>
"But he could have been a rabbi during World War II, fighting the Nazis, or a 
Tibetan monk against the Chinese. The purpose is to show the way a human being 
can reach the heights of humanity, and how one man can make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
The assassination of Archbishop Romero had previously been dramatized in Oliver 
Stone's "Salvador," and "Romero" from its different angle of attack captures 
much the same sense of a society collapsing in a blood bath of 
government-sanctioned butchery. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of James Woods' cynical and exploitative journalist being changed as he 
experiences the appalling violations of human rights, "Romero" offers Julia as 
the bookish priest undergoing a quite similar conversion as he is forced to 
confront what is happening in the country he loves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the ideal for an actor," Julia says, "to be able to show that growth, the 
movements and the emotions, the mountains and the valleys. These days, we seem 
to have in the movies either unrealistic superheroes or bums who end up in 
jail. Here you have a man who was not a superhero but who did things far beyond 
his own small personal self." 
</P>
<P>
The events of "Romero," Julia says, took place within political and religious 
circumstances. But he insists again, "It's not a film about politics or 
religion and it doesn't urge a fight for a particular cause, except for the 
cause of humanity, seen at its best, as you see it at its worst." 
</P>
<P>
Julia, 49 and Puerto Rico-born, was on track to become a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"My family thought it was a way to economic security, and so did I," he says. 
But even as he was finishing his pre-law studies, he changed course. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked inside myself and said, what did I really like to do best? And that 
was to act. And so I decided that that was what I was going to do, no matter 
what. Forget the economic insecurity." 
</P>
<P>
Julia finished his degree at the University of Puerto Rico and went to New 
York, where he still lives. 
</P>
<P>
Work came quickly, in television and in a long and ongoing association with Joe 
Papp and his Public Theatre productions of Shakespeare. Julia has acted in 
"Othello," "Macbeth," "Titus Andronicus," "Hamlet," "Two Gentlemen of Verona," 
"As You Like It" and "King Lear." 
</P>
<P>
Doing "Romero" has not specifically changed his life, Julia says, but it has 
deepened his awareness of the conditions amid which the archbishop lived and 
died. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew about Romero; how could you not? He was outspoken on the violations of 
civil rights in El Salvador. And I remember the outrage, the fury I felt when I 
heard of the assassination. That someone could walk into a church while the 
archbishop was saying Mass and murder him! And the man who did it is still 
walking around free today. It said something about the state of the nation." 
</P>
<P>
One of the other things he learned from doing the role, Julia says, is that the 
archbishop was a flawed human being. "The saints are flawed. It makes them 
closer to us. To me a saint is someone who has become 100% human. The more 
human, the more saintly." 
</P>
<P>
In death, Julia realized during the making of the film, Romero has been the 
pre-eminent symbol of the struggle for human rights in Central America. "It 
takes a lot of bravery, but there are many people inspired to carry on with his 
kind of commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Playing a real rather than a fictional character is always a special and 
sometimes uncomfortable assignment for an actor, more than ever when the 
character has, as Romero has, the popular status of a saint and martyr. 
</P>
<P>
"My largest concern," Julia says, "was to do him in such a way that it was not 
an insult to the people who knew him and revere him. I wanted to do justice to 
him in the eyes of those who loved him." 
</P>
<P>
The film, which opens Friday, has now been seen by some of the archbishop's 
friends and the first responses, Julia says, are reassuring and relieving. An 
Episcopal priest who heads a civil rights commission in El Salvador and knew 
Romero for years told Julia, "You've got him." The present archbishop saw the 
film and said it had his blessing. 
</P>
<P>
"What better satisfaction for me," says Julia, "than the approval of his 
friends, just the fact that they're not insulted."

SOUTHWESTERN DINING: NEW MEXICO STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
No matter where you travel in the Southwest, you can count on two truisms. One: 
the weather will not be what you expect and two: wherever you are is the only 
place you can sample genuinely authentic Southwestern food. 
</P>
<P>
I had these facts confirmed once again when I joined a group of fellow food 
writers on a recent study tour of Southwestern foods in New Mexico. Expecting 
the blazing hot days and semi-cool nights of late July, most of us packed 
accordingly. Big mistake. We should have packed sweaters and hip boots, as we 
were inundated during all but the last day of the New Mexican portion of our 
trip with heavy-duty, gully-washing downpours. Considering California's 
near-drought condition, I kept wishing I could figure a way to blow the 
constant deluge our way. 
</P>
<P>
The food was something else again. Although we did eat in some of New Mexico's 
better restaurants, such as Andre's in Albuquerque and Coyote Cafe and La Casa 
Sena in Santa Fe, we were looking more for the historical background of 
Southwestern food, New Mexico-style. 
</P>
<P>
We wanted to identify the ingredients and food preparation techniques that 
differentiate New Mexican cuisine from those of other Southwestern states, 
including California. So, rather than spending most of our time investigating 
New Mexico's contemporary food scene, we visited a number of Indian pueblos and 
talked with American Indians and museum and university authorities to learn 
more about the origins of this chile-spiced cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
What we discovered is that traditional ingredients have remained popular 
throughout the centuries. Some methods of preparation have been modernized but 
many haven't. Those that have really have affected the end result very little. 
</P>
<P>
Although basically American Indian rather than Spanish (Mexican) in origin, New 
Mexican home-style menus show great similarity to the foods of other 
Southwestern states. But seasonings, some ingredients and many of the food 
presentations and preparation techniques are different. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Dominant Ingredients 
</P>
<P>
Chiles and corn are two ingredients that dominated nearly every menu we 
sampled. That's hardly surprising considering that chiles are the No. 1 
vegetable crop in the state, according to Paul W. Bosland, assistant professor 
in the Department of Agronomy and Horticulture at New Mexico State University 
in Las Cruces. 
</P>
<P>
Bosland, a recognized authority on chiles, told us with a great deal of pride 
that New Mexico grows more chiles than Texas and California combined. New 
Mexicans take their chiles very seriously. They know the best places to find 
the hottest -- around Hatch, N.M. -- and as far as most New Mexicans are 
concerned, the hotter the chile, the better. 
</P>
<P>
A traveler unfamiliar with the local penchant for spiciness will survive a New 
Mexican visit better if he or she approaches any bowl of green chile stew 
offered with caution. I personally ran afoul of one such offering at the Santa 
Ana Pueblo north of Albuquerque when a gracious American Indian hostess allowed 
me to sample some of her green chile stew. I thought my palate was geared to 
hot foods since I adore spicy curries and good Sichuan dishes. One bite of her 
stew, however, paralyzed my vocal chords, and I broke out in a sweat. That 
stuff was just plain hot. But, once the shock of that first taste was over, I 
realized it also was very good. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 chile grown in New Mexico is the somewhat mild Anaheim, or long green 
chile, so familiar to fans of California-style Southwestern cuisine. But where 
we usually find locally grown Anaheims in the fresh green state, in New Mexico 
they often are allowed to mature to a ripe red color before picking. The 
dehydrated red pod usually is crushed into powder and used as a flavoring or to 
add color to prepared dishes. 
</P>
<P>
There is one other marked difference between the Anaheims grown here and those 
cultivated in New Mexico. The higher temperatures and different soil in New 
Mexico produce chiles that are hotter than the same variety of chiles grown 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The major difficulty facing chile growers at present, according to Bosland, is 
that there is almost no way to grow chiles of this type with a predictable, 
uniform heat factor. "Right now we're working on that problem," Bosland said, 
"but we haven't solved it yet. One chile may be hotter than blazes while the 
one next to it is mild." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Spiritual Significance 
</P>
<P>
As with most of the ingredients used in the New Mexican Indian cuisine, corn 
has a deep spiritual significance for the cook. In her small but definitive 
cookbook on Pueblo and Navajo foods and culture, "Southwest Indian Cookbook," 
(Clear Light Publications, Weehawken, N.J., $9.95) photojournalist Marcia 
Keegan quotes Agnes Dill, a prominent American Indian leader from the Isleta 
Pueblo. According to Dill, corn, the most important of all American Indian 
foods, comes in six colors. Each represents a direction. White is the east, red 
south, blue west and yellow north. Black is up and speckled is down. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow and white corn products are certainly familiar to most modern cooks, and 
blue corn has developed into a trendy food in recent years. Most of the other 
colored corns, however, tend to be used simply for decoration outside of the 
Southwest heartland. Blue corn products are generally in limited supply in the 
Los Angeles area, but you can find them in many health food stores and some 
upscale food shops. 
</P>
<P>
Still other ways in which New Mexican foods, both traditional and contemporary, 
differ from similar foods in other Southwestern areas lie in the types of 
seasonings used and the techniques of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
Over and over again, New Mexicans assured us that "the use of sour cream on 
these foods is Californian. We don't use it as a topping for enchiladas, 
tostadas and the like." Mexican oregano is a popular herb and ground comino 
(cumin) is often used in New Mexican cuisine and cilantro is not. In fact, 
except for salt, chiles, garlic and the aforementioned oregano, few spices and 
herbs are used in basic New Mexican cookery. Juniper berries and pinon nuts are 
frequently used for flavoring in stews and heartier dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Although contemporary New Mexicans utilize a much broader array of spices, 
herbs and other ingredients that are to be found in the historical foods native 
to the area, they prepare many recipes familiar to Cal-Mex food lovers quite 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
Enchiladas more often are made by stacking the filled tortillas rather than 
rolling them. And it's de rigueur for New Mexican cooks to top off the stack 
with a fried egg. Also, while Margaritas, served over ice rather than frapped, 
are often the drink choice of diners out for a night on the town, many 
traditional homes serve the modern counterpart of an earlier era's favorite 
fruit drink, none other than cherry-flavored Kool-Aid. 
</P>
<P>
Two menus, sampled a day apart in Santa Fe, turned out to be excellent examples 
of the types of foods readily available to hungry diners in search of real New 
Mexican food. 
</P>
<P>
Former Santa Fe resident Jane Butel, a cookbook author and cooking teacher who 
now lives in New York, demonstrated how to prepare chiles rellenos, carne 
adobada, enchiladas, sopaipillas and several other traditional foods for one of 
the meals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Upscale Version 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the second menu was a delightful upscale creation prepared by 
Culinary Institute of America graduate Kip McClerin, now chef at the historic 
La Casa Sena restaurant on Palace Avenue in the Sena Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Butel's menu was based on recipes from her book, "Jane Butel's Tex-Mex 
Cookbook" ($14.95, Harmony Books). Although the book's title may lead you to 
believe that it is devoted solely to Texas-type Southwestern foods, it isn't. 
The book really covers a wide variety of Southwestern foods, many of them 
decidely New Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
McClerin chose to serve what he termed "home spun food," but it was far from 
the earthier, more traditional fare we had been sampling up to that time. He 
used local products, yes -- blue corn, nopales, poblano and chipotle chiles 
(dried, smoked jalapenos), regional fruits and local cheeses. But what he did 
with them in no way resembled the foods we had been dining on previously. 
</P>
<P>
The following recipes are from these two meals. One caveat. They are not for 
fat or cholesterol watchers or for anyone counting calories. They are, however, 
good food, New Mexican-style.

"I couldn't get inside fast enough to be nourished by other cancer patients, 
and to know I was not alone . . . I could never buy what I got there, not 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gilda Radner 
</P>
<P>
What the late comedian got at the Wellness Community in Santa Monica may soon 
be available to cancer patients and their families in Ventura County, say 
organizers of a move to establish the nationally recognized program here. 
</P>
<P>
Radner, whose tag line, "It's always something," provided an ironic title for 
her book about her struggle with cancer, wrote of a deep-rooted support 
provided by other patients and staff members at the Wellness Community, a 
nonprofit organization offering an array of free seminars, counseling sessions 
and social activities. 
</P>
<P>
Radner, who died in May, earmarked part of the proceeds of her book for the 
7-year-old group. 
</P>
<P>
But even before her death focused public attention on the Wellness Community, a 
group of doctors, nurses, cancer patients and others in the Conejo Valley were 
planning to set up a branch in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Efforts 
</P>
<P>
Similar campaigns are under way at five other locations in California, as well 
as in Knoxville, Tenn., and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County group, which consists of about 130 residents, has raised 
more than $50,000 of the $200,000 anticipated for first-year operating costs, 
said Marty Nason, a registered nurse and mental health counselor who is helping 
spearhead the drive. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers are staging fund-raisers -- including a classical music recital 
Sunday at North Ranch Country Club -- scouring the state for grants and putting 
together a campaign to woo corporate donations. 
</P>
<P>
The activity is all aimed at replicating the Santa Monica program. The Wellness 
Community offers workshops about such suddenly important matters as health 
insurance and nutrition. It teaches patients techniques for relaxation. And it 
provides groups where patients draw each other out of a twilight of anguish and 
even learn to crack jokes about their disease. 
</P>
<P>
But the program is not intended to replace medical treatments. "It's always 
stressed that if you had to choose one or the other, it would be most important 
to choose traditional medicine," said Nason, who has counseled cancer patients 
for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Even as established an organization as the American Cancer Society refers 
patients to the Wellness Community. Barbara Broide, director of the society's 
L. A. Coastal Cities Unit, said her volunteers frequently drive them to the 
Santa Monica headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Commute 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen Ventura County residents commute to the Wellness Community in 
Santa Monica each week, but Nason said the hour's drive is too much for many 
patients. The only other operating Wellness Community is even farther away, in 
Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, more than 8,000 people have received help since the program's 
start, and 500 patients and family members attend self-help groups and seminars 
every week, group leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
Participants fight for their recovery in an atmosphere of hope, support and 
learning, said Harold Benjamin, the organization's founder and unpaid national 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who come here come here because they are fighters. They're not 
giving up on themselves," said Benjamin, an attorney and social psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the modest yellow house that serves as the Wellness Community's 
headquarters, sofas and chairs line the muted peach walls, which are decorated 
with photographs of smiling and laughing participants. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent group discussion meeting, about 25 newcomers heard facilitators Flo 
Porter and Betty Boltuch, both cancer survivors, describe how the Wellness 
Community operates. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, the conversation grew animated, alternately punctuated with 
laughter and tears. 
</P>
<P>
Eddye, a colon cancer patient, told the group how she pictures her chemotherapy 
as miniature Pac Men gobbling cancer cells. Tina, a tall, tanned breast cancer 
patient, drew roars of laughter by telling how her 3-year-old nephew believes 
that her cancer is a severe case of flea infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney, 85, a tall man with a booming voice, talks of his struggle with despair 
over his terminal prognosis. His downy white hair is just starting to grow back 
after falling out from chemotherapy. He strokes his sprouting pate 
affectionately. 
</P>
<P>
As the meeting unfolded, there was laughter, pain, sorrow and joy. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt terribly isolated, terribly alone -- nobody understood what I was going 
through," said Henia, a former breast cancer patient. "But here I found people 
who didn't really know me yet cared so much for me." 
</P>
<P>
Other Wellness Community veterans echo those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
Liver cancer patient Beverly Ginsberg, 40, of Woodland Hills said she might not 
be alive today were it not for the support of fellow cancer patients who talked 
her into undergoing lifesaving chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hair Loss 
</P>
<P>
"When we first went to the Wellness Community, I said I wasn't going to take 
the chemo and they got crazy on me. They said, 'Well, do you want to live or do 
you want to die?' And I said, 'I don't want to lose my hair.' And they said, 
'Oh, get off of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ginsberg did lose her hair, but it has grown back. To see her now, one might 
never guess that she continues to battle cancer. Like many cancer patients, she 
doesn't have the gaunt look often associated with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors told Ginsberg in 1987 that she only had four months to live. Although 
she has survived, the cancer has spread throughout her body and she has more 
recently been told that she must take weekly chemotherapy as long as she lives. 
</P>
<P>
Facing such a proposition, especially when many other cancer patients are 
counting down to the end of their treatments, makes for a lot of anger, 
Ginsberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the Wellness Community, I'm able to vent it and get it out there and be 
angry," she said. "If you can't take some anger, and some prodding, and some 
laughing about cancer, it's not a place for you. It's not a place for people 
who feel sorry for themselves. They may start out that way, but they sure don't 
finish that way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credits Program 
</P>
<P>
Bob Loken, a 54-year-old attorney from Thousand Oaks, can no longer regularly 
commute to Santa Monica because of his cancer. But he credits the Wellness 
Community with providing major psychological help during the earlier stages of 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Loken had prostate cancer for more than 1 1/2 years before he finally decided 
to tell his mother, although other family members knew. He said he could not 
have accomplished the feat alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I'm thinking of her,' and they said, 'Don't think of her; think of 
you, because it's got to emotionally be a drain,' " Loken said. "She took it 
better than I thought she would, and I finally got that weight off my chest."

CHILDHOOD FRIENDS REUNITED ON FIELD AS TOP QUARTERBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Gutierrez, Jason Isaacs and Johnel Turner began the 1980s as impish 
9-year-old pals smacking golf balls onto the roof of Kern Elementary School in 
Oxnard until dusk and clowning all the way back to their homes on Douglas 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
They are closing out the decade as perhaps the most talented trio of high 
school quarterbacks ever to play at once in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The boys from the modest suburban block will lead their teams in three separate 
stadiums at 7:30 p.m. Friday, the kickoff of Ventura County's high school 
football season. Win or lose, the eyes of fans in Oxnard and Ventura will be 
upon them -- as will the eyes of scouts from colleges across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
All are seniors in their third varsity season. Gutierrez attends Santa Clara 
High School, where he holds the state record for passing accuracy. Isaacs is 
the mobile, strong-armed gunner at Buena High who holds a school record for 
passing yardage. Turner is the explosive multiple threat in Oxnard High's 
wishbone attack who rushed for more than 1,000 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
They have gone separate directions -- only Gutierrez still lives on Douglas -- 
and developed distinctive styles. But friendships are easily rekindled as they 
discovered last week while lunching as only three hot-shot high school 
quarterbacks can lunch. 
</P>
<P>
That impishness? It's now full-blown impudence. 
</P>
<P>
Huddled over platters of steak and all-you-can-eat shrimp, they skewered one 
another with all-you-can-take barbs and laughed too loudly for most restaurant 
patrons. Only when the conversation turned to knee injuries or the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test did the silliness subside. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterbacks have long been synonymous with brashness. Joe Namath's 
autobiography is titled "I Can't Wait Until Tomorrow, Because I Get Better 
Looking Every Day." Isaacs and Turner fit the mold to a T-formation. Gutierrez 
is normally more reserved, but in the company of his old pals, he quickly 
loosened up. 
</P>
<P>
The three QBs hadn't been together in six years, but as a car carrying Isaacs 
and Turner pulled into the Santa Clara parking lot to pick up a smartly dressed 
Gutierrez from his first day of classes, they dispensed with the pleasantries. 
</P>
<P>
Rather. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Turner to Gutierrez: "Nice cords, Tim. Do they squeak?" 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs to Gutierrez: "Look at you, man. I should have worn a tux." 
</P>
<P>
Being rushed from both sides doesn't bother Gutierrez, who shows off his quick 
release. "You'd have to rent one," he gleefully snaps at Isaacs. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez became a quarterback first, tackling the position as an 8-year-old in 
the Oxnard Chiefs youth program. Turner, a tough, stocky boy, played offensive 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs was off somewhere playing soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Turner shifted to fullback a couple of years later and Gutierrez became 
entrenched at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs was still off playing soccer. Turner would ask him, "Where you from, 
Yugoslavia?" Isaacs recalls wryly, "I never liked football. I was a nerd, a 
lost cause." 
</P>
<P>
He and Gutierrez built a makeshift miniature golf course in Isaacs' back yard. 
Unless he could take a full swing, Turner declined to form a threesome. "I was 
off cavorting with the females," he recalls with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring, though, the three shared a love for baseball. One year, Isaacs 
and Gutierrez did the pitching on a team that was 24-1. Another year, Turner 
and Gutierrez led a Northside Little League all-star team to the state 
divisional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs moved to Alaska from his home on quiet, tree-lined Douglas when he was 
11 and moved to Ventura a year later. He and Gutierrez maintained their 
friendship by telephone and it was during those conversations that a 
13-year-old Isaacs was persuaded to try out for the Ventura Packers youth team. 
</P>
<P>
"The first day of practice, I couldn't throw a spiral 10 yards," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
But Isaacs went on to win the quarterback job and his identity was set as he 
entered high school. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez was also instrumental in Turner lining up behind center. 
</P>
<P>
Early in their 13-year-old season with the Chiefs, Gutierrez injured his right 
shoulder and the coach surveyed the team for a likely replacement. Turner 
recalls: "He said, 'Johnel, you have a good arm. Go take some snaps.' " 
</P>
<P>
Will the real Johnel Turner please huddle up? 
</P>
<P>
There is the soft-spoken, straight-forward Turner, the one who carefully 
measures his accomplishments with neatly told anecdotes, who steadfastly 
defends the expertise of his coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the blowing, crowing Joh-nel, the one with the perpetual smirk 
and the ready reply. "I know, man. I know." 
</P>
<P>
About his ability, everyone knows. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best pure athlete I've ever had," says Jack Davis, the Oxnard coach 
who has been in the business for 30 years. "He has the best arm and he's the 
best runner." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Davis implemented the wishbone to take advantage of his 
quarterback's running ability. Turner (6 feet, 190 pounds) rushed for 1,085 
yards, 10 touchdowns and a Ventura County-high 8.5-yard average. He only 
completed 31 passes but they went for 646 yards, a county-leading 20.8-yard 
average. 
</P>
<P>
His grade-point average has been less impressive. Davis says Turner should have 
the necessary 2.0 in a core curriculum required by the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. for a Division I scholarship. But it has been a struggle at 
every turn. 
</P>
<P>
"If he feels a teacher doesn't like him, he'll go into a shell and do worse," 
Davis says. "If he believes a teacher likes him, he'll respond to that and do 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Davis, Jack's son and an Oxnard assistant coach, helps Turner overcome 
academic difficulties. Halfway through the spring semester, Turner was failing 
in math. Joe Davis told him to bring his work to a first-period weight-training 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this thick stack of work, but I studied math every first period, 
plus 1 1/2 to 2 hours after school," Turner recalls. "I finished the whole 
stack by the end of the semester, thanks to Coach Joe." 
</P>
<P>
It's going to take similar diligence this year if Turner is to be in a position 
to accept a scholarship from one of the big-name schools that are interested in 
him, schools that include most of the option-oriented schools in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"College was the furthest thing from his mind while he was growing up," Jack 
Davis says. "Then he came to high school and discovered he has this special 
football ability." 
</P>
<P>
Turner's awakening occurred while dashing for the winning touchdown in his 
first varsity game, a 13-7 victory over Camarillo during his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
With three minutes to play in a 7-7 tie, Oxnard was faced with a third-down 
situation on the Camarillo 45-yard line. Davis called for Turner to run a 
bootleg around end. 
</P>
<P>
"I must have hit six of their guys; I bounced off all of them," Turner recalls. 
"They hit me but they weren't tackling me. My helmet came unbuttoned but I just 
kept moving forward. I guess I had that desire to get into the end zone. 
Finally, I got in and I asked myself, 'How'd I do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
By mid-season, Turner's ability had not only sunk in, it was bubbling over. 
Moments after Oxnard had whipped Buena, 28-12, Turner dashed past the Buena 
bench, holding up his index finger and taunting the beaten Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs, then a Buena sophomore, recalls: "He ran by and said, 'You guys will be 
good next year.' We remembered that the entire week we prepared for Oxnard last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Turner was as prophetic as he was cocky. Buena was good enough last year to 
defeat Oxnard, 35-15, dashing the Yellowjackets' playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
At lunch, Turner was asked if he had learned from the experience. 
</P>
<P>
He pondered the question while peeling the batter from a shrimp. He took a 
bite, said, "I still like to talk," and threw Isaacs and Gutierrez a 
mischievous grin. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because his considerable athletic accomplishments need no 
embellishment, Isaacs is perfectly comfortable taking a long laugh at himself. 
He loves telling of his first play from scrimmage as a varsity quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
The game was in 1987 against Ventura, which that year had a powerful team led 
by a fearsome middle linebacker named Steve Dailey. Isaacs had spent most of 
the season playing defensive back, but was handed the quarterback job for the 
big game against Buena's cross-town rival. 
</P>
<P>
"I crouched behind the center to call signals," Isaacs recalls. "I looked to 
the left and saw this enormous crowd in the stands. I looked to the right and 
saw just as many faces. Then I looked straight ahead and saw Steve Dailey 
staring me in the face. 
</P>
<P>
"I just panicked, I was so scared. I fumbled the snap, fell on the ball and 
about 10 guys dog-piled on top of me. 
</P>
<P>
"When I stood up, Dailey grabbed my jersey and said, 'Don't you ever do that 
again.' " 
</P>
<P>
Punch line told, Isaacs throws his head back and erupts into laughter. It was 
as if the incident had happened to someone else and, to an extent, it had. 
</P>
<P>
The self-described "lost cause" has matured into a seasoned passer who racked 
up a school-record 2,281 yards last season. Isaacs (6-1, 185) also posted a 
10-0 record and 0.68 earned-run average last spring as a pitcher on the Buena 
baseball team, and next summer he might be faced with a choice between a 
football scholarship and a professional baseball contract. 
</P>
<P>
His development as a quarterback is linked to the hiring of Rick Scott as Buena 
football coach before last season. Scott, a former quarterback who is committed 
to the passing game, quickly recognized Isaacs' potential. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I saw Jason's athleticism, I knew we had something to build on," 
says Scott, who coached Hart High to a Southern Section championship in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Scott has been more than a coach to Isaacs, who has had a difficult home life. 
The coach, in fact, had his quarterback over for Thanksgiving dinner last year. 
"He's a real street kid, that's the only way to say it," Scott says. "But he's 
got a lot of moxie and a big heart. 
</P>
<P>
"The best things in his life have come through sports." 
</P>
<P>
Although Douglas Avenue is now nothing more than memory lane for Isaacs and 
Turner, it is still home for Gutierrez, who has lived in the same house all his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Serving as the cool, collected man in the middle of their friendship came 
naturally for Gutierrez. Security and stability are evident in all phases of 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez (6-2, 195) is the youngest of five children, and the laughing eyes 
and round features of the family baby are still prominent. He is the only one 
of the three QBs to have a steady girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
His three older brothers all attended Santa Clara and Kenny, now 23, was a 
quarterback. Tim's coach at Santa Clara, Larry Lawrence, was also his first 
coach at the age of 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim was never a loudmouth; he's never been flamboyant," Lawrence says. "With 
all of his accomplishments, I never once have heard the kid brag. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just always there standing tall." 
</P>
<P>
In the huddle, in the pass pocket, there Gutierrez stands -- the cool, 
collected man in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of his composure is the state record that he holds for completing 
70.4% of his passes last season. A quarterback does not hit seven of every 10 
by throwing into crowds in a panic or by running scared. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides having a strong arm and an exceptionally quick release, Tim is able to 
read defenses well," Lawrence says. "If the primary receiver is covered, he has 
the presence of mind to find the next guy." 
</P>
<P>
When starting quarterback Mike Teron was injured during the first game of the 
1987 season, Steve Dann, then the Santa Clara coach, decided that Gutierrez was 
going to be the next guy and he was promoted from the sophomore team the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"I was up in the stands when Mike got hurt and I couldn't believe it," 
Gutierrez says. "There was no way I wanted to leave the sophomore team. I told 
my friends that I wouldn't go." 
</P>
<P>
Dann summoned him, however, and the next Friday night, Gutierrez found himself 
in the middle of his first varsity game. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the game, I went back to pass and I was aware of pressure coming from 
both sides," Gutierrez recalls. "I stepped up and remained in the pocket. I 
threw an incomplete pass and took a hard hit, but when I got back to the bench, 
the coaches were congratulating me for not panicking." 
</P>
<P>
The reinforcement paid off because on Santa Clara's next possession, Gutierrez 
capped a long drive with a 15-yard touchdown pass. He's been throwing them with 
regularity ever since, passing for 20 touchdowns and 2,644 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez has 4,300 yards passing in two seasons and if he duplicates last 
year's total, he will rank third on the Southern Section all-time list behind 
Todd Marinovich and Pat Haden. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers impress even Isaacs and Turner. But they are envious of their 
friend for playing in the Frontier League, which contains smaller schools than 
the Channel League, to which Buena and Oxnard belong. 
</P>
<P>
At lunch, Isaacs' eyes scan the menu. "Who's this Dom Perignon?" he asks, 
casting a smile at Gutierrez. "Sounds like a defensive back in the Frontier 
League." 
</P>
<P>
The three QBs put away three platters of shrimp apiece -- of course, they had 
to get back to school for football practice. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, they vowed not to become strangers. Isaacs asked Gutierrez to 
arrange a date with one of those "fine" Santa Clara girls, then he turned to 
Turner and told him about a girl at Buena who would be perfect for him, saying, 
"She looks just like Robin Givens." 
</P>
<P>
But friendship has its limits. Buena faces Oxnard in a Channel League opener 
Sept. 29. Isaacs knows that Turner, who plays defensive back in addition to 
quarterback, won't be wearing his luncheon smile. 
</P>
<P>
"When I step on the field that night, Johnel and I won't be friends," Isaacs 
says. "I know that sometime during the game he's gonna hit me. It's 
inevitable." 
</P>

JURY FINDS MAN GUILTY IN KIDNAPING OF 2; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDANT FACES LIFE TERMS IN ABDUCTION OF MARKET OWNER'S FAMILY

<TEXT>
<P>
A jury has convicted a 28-year-old Los Angeles man of kidnaping the wife and 
daughter of a Long Beach market owner last March. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Carlos Pena was found guilty last Friday in Norwalk Superior Court of two 
counts of kidnaping for ransom and one count of robbery for the abduction of 
Maria del Refugio Sanchez, 33, and her daughter, Yesenia, 5. 
</P>
<P>
Two other defendants, Eliazar Romero Cuaei, 26, and Martin Galvan Ceja, 26, 
each pleaded guilty to two counts of kidnaping for ransom and one count of 
robbery during jury selection for the trial, which started on Aug. 21, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Charles A. Lawhorn said. They were to have been tried with Pena. 
</P>
<P>
The three men each face two life prison terms for the kidnapings and a 
five-year term for robbery when they are sentenced later this month, Lawhorn 
said. The men were convicted of robbery for taking $50 from Sanchez' purse, 
Lawhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Pena testified that he was not involved in the kidnaping but was merely present 
when Sheriff's deputies raided the small Los Angeles home where the victims 
were rescued after four days. Pena said he was homeless and looking for work in 
downtown Los Angeles when he ran across Cuaei, who told him to go to the house 
and search for work. 
</P>
<P>
But Maria Sanchez testified that Pena was in the van that was used in the 
kidnaping. The jury deliberated for two hours before returning the guilty 
verdict. Yesenia Sanchez, the daughter, did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an issue of credibility as to whether they believed his alibi that he 
was a homeless person looking for work," Lawhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Froilan Sanchez, 39, was at his La Michoacana Market on Paramount Boulevard in 
Long Beach on March 6 when he received a call telling him that his wife and 
daughter had been abducted that morning from their La Mirada home, sheriff's 
officials said after the arrests. The caller demanded A$100,000 for their safe 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Sanchez testified during the trial that she was warming up her car to 
take her daughter to preschool when Ceja approached and said her husband had 
been seriously injured in an accident at work. She and her daughter voluntarily 
climbed into a van with Ceja, she testified. She was later blindfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Froilan Sanchez, who had called the Sheriff's Department, received six more 
calls from the abductors during the next four days. The ransom was eventually 
raised to $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez raised the ransom money from his business, his bank, relatives and 
friends, and agreed to drop the money at a phone booth in a Los Angeles parking 
lot, authorities said. Detectives had him under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Cuaei picked up the money and drove off. He was arrested a short time later and 
led lawmen to the 121st Street home, where they arrested Pena, Ceja, Juan 
Manuel Cordova, 21, and Jose Luis Estrada, 43. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Sanchez and her daughter were found unharmed in a rear bedroom of the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The cases against Cordova and Estrada were dismissed last May because of 
insufficient evidence, Lawhorn said

COUNTY BOARD OKS STUDIES OF 2 MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a narrow margin, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors has decided that 
developers who have proposed building two large subdivisions in eastern Ventura 
County may proceed with environmental impact reports that will cost a total of 
$450,000. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 3 to 2 this week to allow the studies for the Ahmanson Ranch 
and Jordan Ranch subdivisions. Together, the projects would bring 12,000 new 
residents and 240 acres of commercial, office and retail space into the rolling 
hills near Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The reports, funded by developers, will be completed by McClelland Consultants, 
of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Susan K. Lacey and John K. Flynn voted against the proposal, saying 
they were concerned that the projects would generate air pollution and traffic 
and eliminate green space. 
</P>
<P>
"These issues just aren't going to be mitigated in a satisfactory way, no 
matter how many environmental impact reports you do," Flynn said. "For me to 
vote on the EIR was just another vote for the commitment of the project. It 
would be hard for me to face the developer down the road when the EIR comes 
back, when I already have these questions in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, who represents Thousand Oaks and the surrounding 
area, referred to Tuesday's action as housekeeping and said it would not affect 
the county's decisions on the subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a perfunctory action which just says, 'Give us more information,' " 
Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
The vote followed a preliminary report that indicated that county staff members 
were concerned that the projects would worsen air pollution, benefit affluent 
instead of middle-income buyers and set a precedent in using green space. 
</P>
<P>
The projects are far from approved. Although the board approved the 
commissioning of the reports, it must hold public hearings on them before 
deciding whether to allow the projects. 
</P>
<P>
But county planners say the subdivisions would deviate from longstanding county 
guidelines that attempt to keep development within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
It could also set a dangerous precedent for other developers who want to 
proceed with their own plans in land zoned for open space, some planners said. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmanson Land Co. of Irwindale has proposed building 3,000 homes and apartments 
and two golf courses on 5,477 acres north of Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The firm would build offices, high-tech industries, retail businesses and 
hotels on 240 acres. It would leave 3,018 acres for open space and 196 acres 
for parks. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac Investment Associates of Gaithersburg, Md., has proposed 1,152 houses 
and apartments and a PGA Tournament golf course on a 2,308-acre tract west of 
the Jordan Ranch project.

TRUSTEES OF COLLEGE CUT THEIR BUDGET FOR TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN McALPINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of criticism by a district trustee, the Ventura County Community 
College District this week cut its proposed $100,000 in travel allowances for 
trustees and administrators by more than $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, most of the money saved would be put into a reserve fund, where it 
could be tapped for travel by a vote of the board. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Hirschberg, the trustee who had most vigorously objected to the proposed 
travel budget, said the decision, made during adoption Tuesday of the 
district's $57.8-million budget, represented more than an academic difference. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't a shell game," he said. "I think it represents a commitment by the 
district to keep a better account of its funds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revising Procedure 
</P>
<P>
Tom Ely, Board of Trustees president, emphasized that the move was merely a 
matter of revising accounting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"Through all the discussion, there was not one implication of any impropriety, 
lack of morality in accounting or overspending by anybody," Ely said. 
</P>
<P>
Hirschberg, a trustee since 1987, had complained that administrators were 
making unnecessary trips to conventions and seminars, diverting money from the 
district's three colleges in Oxnard, Moorpark and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The original $101,895 travel budget would have allowed district officials to 
spend nearly twice the amount they spent on travel two years ago, an increase 
that had led Hirschberg to characterize the district's travel budget as 
"ballooning" and "runaway." 
</P>
<P>
Under the revised budget, district Chancellor Barbara Derryberry and executive 
vice chancellor Ray Hearon will lose $10,200 that had been designated for their 
car allowances. Another $24,500 also designated for district travel will be 
funneled instead into the reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Substantially Deflated' 
</P>
<P>
The moves lower the travel budget from a proposed $101,895 to $67,000 for about 
60 district employees, including the five elected trustees and a student 
trustee. The new allowance is about $8,800 less than the $76,047 district 
officials spent on travel last year. "The figure is substantially deflated," 
Hirschberg said. "I'm very happy about that." 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, Hirschberg also proposed that the district break its 
travel budget into clearer categories, rather than lumping travel money into 
"one jumbo account." That would allow board members to have a more accurate 
measure of how and where travel money is being spent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although trustees approved Hirschberg's proposal, Tom Kimberling, vice 
chancellor for administrative services, said the change would probably not go 
into effect until next year. Kimberling said it would be too difficult to break 
down the budget that is already in place. He said he would be meeting with 
staff members later in the week to start reviewing travel items that could be 
itemized in next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
District travel expenditures previously have been criticized as excessive. 
Responding to such criticism, trustees in 1987 voted to limit themselves to 
travel expenses of $1,000 each.

<P>
Travel budget -- A Sept. 7 article erroneously reported that the Ventura County 
Community College District had cut its proposed $100,000 travel budget by more 
than $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the budget was not cut. About $34,000 was transferred to a reserve 
fund, which also would be used for travel expenses. The article said using the 
fund required a vote of the board, but no such vote is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The article also wrongly said district Chancellor Barbara Derryberry and Vice 
Chancellor Ray Hearon would lose a total of $10,200 that had been designated 
for their car allowances. Those funds have not been taken from either official.

SENATE OKS BAN ON NEW DUMPS IN WATER BASIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate on Tuesday approved legislation to prohibit new landfills being 
developed in the already contaminated San Gabriel Valley Water Basin, which 
provides drinking water to more than 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
However, the bill would exempt the controversial proposed expansion of the 
Azusa Land Reclamation Co. landfill because of an amendment agreed upon in June 
by the Senate Agriculture and Water Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park), who introduced the bill, said she 
was not pleased by the revision, but accepted it rather than see her proposal 
shelved. "I felt it was a hostile amendment, but I also feel that it's very 
important that we get the bill passed and signed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Regional water quality control boards are now prohibited from issuing waste 
discharge permits for a new landfill in a gravel pit or sand pit. But the 
boards can grant a variance if they determine that a landfill will not pollute 
ground water. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would block expansion of existing garbage dumps or new landfills in 
at least 12 large gravel pits along the San Gabriel River. 
</P>
<P>
It was approved on a 25-5 vote and sent back to the Assembly for final action. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner said the aim of her bill is to prohibit the regional boards from 
granting variances for expansion of dumps, including the Azusa landfill. But, 
she added: "I didn't have Azusa as a target." 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Land Reclamation Co., a subsidiary of Browning-Ferris Industries, is 
seeking to expand the dump so it can receive 6,000 tons of trash a day. It is 
now the least active landfill in Los Angeles County, receiving 1,500 tons a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the State Water Resources Control Board turned down a staff 
recommendation to allow the expansion but asked both sides to hammer out a 
compromise, to be discussed at a hearing Wednesday in Sacramento. 
Browning-Ferris has retained the services of four lobbying firms to press its 
case for expanding the dump. 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris has proposed installing an elaborate system of liners and 
barricades to block the waste from contaminating the water supply. But the Main 
San Gabriel Basin Watermaster, an organization of water producers opposed to 
the dump expansion, maintains that allowing the dump to expand in the porous 
sand and gravel pit would eventually damage the water basin. 
</P>
<P>
Partly as a result of the dispute in Azusa, Tanner sought to block expansion of 
existing landfills or new dumps in gravel pits such as the Azusa landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The ground water in the basin is among the most contaminated in the country, 
according to a Senate staff analysis of the Tanner bill. Supporters of the 
measure maintain that it will help protect the ground water from pollution and 
contamination by potentially toxic compounds. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Berlien, executive officer of the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster, said 
Wednesday that he is especially concerned that about 12 large gravel pits, 
covering approximately 1,000 acres, might be used as landfills in the future if 
the Tanner bill is not enacted into law. He said his agency agreed to delete 
the Azusa landfill from the legislation because the state water control board 
will probably decide the fate of the Azusa expansion before the legislation 
takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
Among the opponents of the bill are the southern division of the California 
Refuse Removal Council, the Southern California Ready Mix Concrete Assn. and 
the state water board. 
</P>
<P>
The board maintains that the bill "would set an inappropriate precedent for 
banning landfills located over selected aquifers," according to the Senate 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner acknowledged that the bill has been heavily lobbied. Through the first 
six months of this year, Browning-Ferris reported paying $47,976 to three 
separate Sacramento firms to lobby the Water Resources Control Board and 
legislators on Tanner's bill and other legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris reported paying Advocation Inc., headed by Donald K. Brown, 
$18,750; Michael B. Kahl, $10,580 and Victor F. Stefan, $18,646. 
Browning-Ferris also retained the services of a firm owned by Michael 
Franchetti, Gov. George Deukmejian's former finance director, and David P. 
Swoap, former Secretary of Health and Welfare under Deukmejian, but had not 
reported paying them any fees as of June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris also has reported contributing $19,500 to lawmakers during the 
same period, according to the report filed with the Secretary of State's 
Office.

TERRY TELLS JURY: 'I HAVE TO FACE GOD SOMEDAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comparing himself to civil rights leaders who "stood up to . . . tyranny," 
anti-abortion leader Randall Terry tried one last time Wednesday to persuade a 
jury, in the name of justice, to find him and his co-defendants innocent of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
In the closing argument in his trial on charges of trespassing and conspiracy, 
Terry, 30-year-old founder of Operation Rescue, reminded the Municipal Court 
jury of periods in history when blacks were relegated to the backs of buses and 
women had no right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'These Dark Hours' 
</P>
<P>
"But during these dark hours, there were people who stood up to the tyranny," 
Terry said. "And what did these people have in common? Susan B. Anthony 
arrested, Rosa Parks arrested, Dr. (Martin Luther) King arrested. But being 
arrested is not a crime." 
</P>
<P>
And like those activists, Terry said, he hopes to be vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
Terry is one of five anti-abortion activists being tried on a host of 
misdemeanor charges stemming from the March 25 blockade of a women's clinic on 
Westmoreland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Terry is representing himself, as are co-defendants Jeff White, 31, and Michael 
McMonagle, 36. Donald Bennette, 36, and Andrew Eppink, also on trial, are being 
represented by counsel. 
</P>
<P>
As members of the defense team presented their final arguments to the jury, 
they reiterated a key contention -- that political pressure from key city 
officials prompted Los Angeles police to arrest and abuse anti-abortion 
demonstrators at the March sit-in. 
</P>
<P>
And while never admitting that they broke the law, the defense team continually 
referred to a much higher law than that set forth by the state. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons I'm in this is because as an individual I have to face God 
someday," Terry said. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Woe to those who decree unjust situations,' " said Terry, quoting from the 
Book of Isaiah. 
</P>
<P>
He earlier referred to the "inalienable rights" guaranteed in the Declaration 
of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
"God gives people rights, and the founders of our country knew that," said 
Terry, who later added that he wanted to be able to tell his yet-unborn 
grandchildren that "I did all I could during that hour of history" when 
abortion was legal. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Richard A. Paez ruled before the trial began that the 
"necessity" defense, which holds that laws can be broken in the interest of 
preventing greater harm, did not apply in this case because abortion is legal. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the moot argument has been brought up constantly, much to the annoyance of 
the judge, who has in the past threatened the defendants with contempt. On 
Wednesday he had to order the jury at least eight times to disregard the 
statements made by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Terry conceded that the morality of abortion would not be decided 
in a Los Angeles municipal courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"You are not voting to overturn Roe vs. Wade," Terry told the jurors, referring 
to the landmark decision that legalized abortion. "If you acquit us, you're not 
voting to overthrow the government. You are not voting for anarchy. What you 
are calling for is justice." 
</P>
<P>
Closing arguments are expected to conclude today, at which time jurors will 
begin deliberations.

CITY ETHICS PANEL URGES LOBBYING CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top Los Angeles city officials, including all elected officials and department 
heads, should be banned from City Hall lobbying for a year after leaving their 
posts, a city ethics panel report said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's report also called for greater restrictions on the lobbying 
activities of former lower-level officials and fuller public disclosure of whom 
lobbyists represent and the specific projects they are promoting. 
</P>
<P>
"Allowing people to pass too readily between public and private employment . . 
. presents opportunities for personal relationships to be exploited, 
confidential information to be used inappropriately, and may encourage 
self-serving individuals who are only looking to make contacts for future 
employment to become part of the government," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report is one of a series prepared by the staff of a commission that is 
drafting a new ethics code for city government. The panel was formed by Mayor 
Tom Bradley last April, the day after he won an unexpectedly narrow election to 
a fifth term amid a growing controversy over possible conflicts of interest in 
his personal business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's work has become part of broader reevaluation of City Hall ethics 
regulations and enforcement triggered by the current city attorney's probe of 
Bradley, particularly fees he accepted from two financial institutions that had 
dealings with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Several City Council members have proposed reform packages of their own and the 
council's Ad Hoc Ethics Committee, chaired by Councilman Michael Woo, is 
expected to recommend its own reforms in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The city's current ethics code has been widely criticized for being vague and 
toothless. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Estrich, a Harvard University law professor and former campaign manager 
for Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, told the Los Angeles 
Ethics Commission Wednesday that City Hall's current lobbyist regulations 
"leave too many areas for conflicting loyalties." Estrich is serving as unpaid 
special counsel to the mayor's commission and helped write the latest report. 
</P>
<P>
The report called for: 
</P>
<P>
* A one-year "cooling-off" period in which the mayor, City Council members, 
department heads and salaried members of the Public Works Commission could 
engage in no lobbying -- or advising clients -- with any branch of city 
government. Currently, those officials may return to City Hall to lobby 
immediately after leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
* Restricting other commissioners and city employees from lobbying the 
departments they worked for for at least one year. Currently, such officials 
are restricted only from lobbying on specific matters in which they were 
personally involved. 
</P>
<P>
* More detailed disclosure by lobbyists, particularly by lawyers, of the 
clients they represent, the contracts or projects they are working on and the 
fees they collect. Currently, lawyers often list their law firms as the party 
they represent. 
</P>
<P>
Former city Planning Commission President Dan Garcia, now a successful lobbyist 
for developers, took exception to some of the recommendations. Garcia told the 
panel that the regulations do not recognize the significant political clout 
that organized homeowners, who also have a vested interest in developments, can 
wield. 
</P>
<P>
He also argued that it would be "unconscionable" to force him to report all of 
the fees he collects from clients with city business. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of what I do is not lobbying," he said, describing meetings with 
architects and reviews of city ordinances. "It makes it appear I'm being paid 
thousands and thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
But another prominent lobbyist, Maureen Kindell, Bradley's former Public Works 
Commission chairman, told the panel that she generally supported the proposals 
and believed that they clarify the ground rules. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, who also testified, endorsed most of the proposals, some of which he has 
proposed himself. But he said lobbyists should not have to disclose their fees, 
which he said are merely an object of curiosity.

TEEN-AGER, BOY, 7, DIE IN ASSAULT RIFLE ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 7-year-old boy and a teen-ager were shot to death Wednesday outside an 
apartment building in South-Central Los Angeles when two men walked up and 
began firing with AK-47 semi-automatic rifles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The outburst of violence at 3:45 p.m. near the intersection of 111th Street and 
Broadway was apparently gang related although Los Angeles police investigators 
said they had not determined a motive for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen first fired on Melvin Morris Gentry, 17, striking him once in the 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
Several feet away, a bullet hit the boy, identified as Lamont Compton, in the 
head while he sat in a parked car with Judy Moore, 29, who suffered a gunshot 
wound to her arm, according to Lt. Doug Collison. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the victims later died of their wounds at Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was treated and released from the same hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Collison said two young assailants drove up to the apartment building in a 
pickup truck and "approached a guy in front of this building." 
</P>
<P>
"Both suspects were armed with rifles, and a large number of shots were fired," 
Collison said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who remain at large, fled in a blue pickup truck. They were 
described as 18 or 19 years old and were armed with AK-47 assault rifles.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CERRITOS ADDED TO QUARANTINE AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ban on the export of home-grown fruit and vegetables was placed on the 
Cerritos area Wednesday because of an infestation of Oriental fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's ban means a total of 190 square miles in Los Angeles County are 
under quarantine for agricultural pests. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, three Oriental fruit flies were detected in Burbank, prompting 
officials to order ground spraying of insecticide on fence posts, trees and 
utility poles. 
</P>
<P>
Oriental fruit flies are potentially as destructive as the more notorious 
Mediterranean fruit flies, which agricultural officials are battling over 70 
square miles north of downtown Los Angeles. But Oriental fruit flies have 
become a more common occurrence in Southern California, and eradication efforts 
have not involved the controversial aerial spraying of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
The latest quarantine was imposed on a 79-square-mile area straddling the Los 
Angeles-Orange County line. Under the quarantine, commercially grown fruit and 
vegetables must be treated and approved by the county agricultural commissioner 
before it can be removed from the area.

COUNCIL PUTS UP $96 MILLION FOR NEXT PHASE OF METRO RAIL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday agreed to fund its $96-million share 
of the next phase of the Metro Rail project, after strictly limiting the city's 
liability for any cost overruns on the $1.4-billion segment. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement forged with the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission 
after weeks of bargaining is expected to clear the way for the commission to 
apply to the federal Urban Mass Transit Administration for $667 million. That 
would provide 46% of the projected cost to build the next 6.6 miles of the 
subway, extending the line to Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is the funding authority for the entire $3.7-billion rail line, 
which is designed to run from downtown Los Angeles 17.3 miles to North 
Hollywood. By the terms of the funding agreement, the city will pay 6.6% of the 
costs over the next 10 years, using its share of a half-cent sales tax approved 
by county voters in 1980 to pay for rail development. 
</P>
<P>
The council also committed the city to share in any cost overruns on the next 
6.6-mile segment of Metro Rail construction. However, in the agreement approved 
Wednesday, the city's liability is limited to 5% of the over-budget costs up to 
a maximum of $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
With expenditures headed for $300 million a mile as the first phase of the 
project approaches the halfway mark, cost overruns have become the focal point 
of a growing controversy involving the city, the Southern California Rapid 
Transit District and the county Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the first 4.4-mile segment of the project from Union Station to 
MacArthur Park at Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street is under way by the 
transit district. The job is estimated to be $135 million over budget and 
nearly two years behind schedule, according to a commission audit. Transit 
district officials, while agreeing that costs have gone up, say the 
commission's numbers are exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
The commission -- which has overall funding authority on the project -- and the 
transit district are locked in a struggle over which agency will control the 
budgets and construction of the next phases of the big subway project. 
</P>
<P>
There is already concern that the second phase of Metro Rail construction -- 
extending the line from MacArthur Park 13 miles out to North Hollywood -- will 
run over the projected $2.5-billion cost by as much as 15% or $338 million, 
officials report. 
</P>
<P>
To contain these escalating costs, the commission has created a cost-reduction 
panel and is considering ways to scale back project expenditures without 
reducing the miles of track or number of stations.

ST. JOHN NEGOTIATING OVER RELEASE OF FINANCIAL RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for the embattled head of a tax-supported Africa trade group were 
negotiating Wednesday over the possible release of subpoenaed financial 
documents that their client so far has refused to provide to city auditors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the process of talking to them about releasing records," said Vicki 
Podberesky, an attorney for Juanita St. John, executive director of the Task 
Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations. "All parties are working toward an 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
News of the negotiations came as a number of legal and administrative deadlines 
were closing in on St. John, whose group is under investigation by city and 
state agencies for possible misuse of funds. 
</P>
<P>
City Controller Rick Tuttle is expected to release soon an audit of the task 
force's use of $400,000 in city funds over the last four years. His auditors 
and the city attorney's office have said that St. John has failed to account 
for $180,000 of the funds and that they have found evidence that task force and 
personal funds were mingled in St. John family checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Tuttle nor officials in the city attorney's office could be reached for 
comment on the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arraignment Sept. 15 
</P>
<P>
Also, St. John is scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 15 on criminal charges that 
she failed to produce records subpoenaed by the controller. And the state 
attorney general's office has given St. John until the end of the week to 
produce delinquent reports on how the nonprofit organization's money has been 
spent. 
</P>
<P>
Podberesky declined to say who initiated the negotiations or how long they had 
been going on. 
</P>
<P>
"If we cooperate," she said, "we would respond fully to the subpoena . . . we 
would give everything within Mrs. St. John's ability to produce." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the negotiations involve determining what records the controller's 
office already has, Podberesky said, noting that auditors months ago were given 
access to some task force records. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she is confident that the records will account for the $180,000 in 
question, she said: "That's another matter. That's something that would have to 
be determined by the auditors. . . . We can only produce what we have." 
</P>
<P>
St. John was not available for comment, but she has indicated in the past that 
she has not misused funds and that she will be able to show that the task force 
owes her money. 
</P>
<P>
If an agreement is reached on the release of records, it could mean that the 
charges for failing to obey the subpoena would be dropped. The city attorney in 
charge of the case was not available. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Atty. Gen. James Cordi said he will recommend that a civil 
suit be filed against St. John if state-mandated records are not filed by 
Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Podberesky said she could not comment on the attorney general's investigation.

HOW FAST?;

<P>
POLICE USING GIANT ROADSIDE SPEEDOMETER TO FLASH DRIVERS A NOT-SO-SUBTLE 
REMINDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, you say you didn't realize how fast you were going? 
</P>
<P>
From now on, there may be 12-inch-high digital numbers flashing at the roadside 
to remind you. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to coax motorists into slowing down, a growing number of Los 
Angeles-area communities are turning to radar guns that display the speed of 
passing cars on glowing, trailer-mounted screens parked along city streets. 
</P>
<P>
This is not photo radar, the controversial device used by Pasadena to ticket 
drivers who speed unwittingly past a camouflaged camera. 
</P>
<P>
It is merely a giant speedometer, police say, a non-threatening sign that slows 
traffic by showing both the posted speed limit and, in flashing yellow digits, 
the speed of approaching cars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so simple," said Sgt. Robert Wilson, head of the traffic division at the 
sheriff's substation in the City of Industry. "But the thing is, it works. It's 
amazing that it hasn't been thought of before." 
</P>
<P>
The first such unit in Los Angeles County makes its debut today out of the 
sheriff's City of Industry station, which covers the City of Industry, La 
Puente, La Habra Heights, Hacienda Heights and several other unincorporated 
communities in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen California cities, including Irvine, Santa Barbara, Monterey 
and San Jose, already have them in use. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, Torrance, Duarte and Temple City have approved purchase of the 
4-by-6-foot trailers, which can be towed by a police car and left on any street 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think most motorists speed intentionally," said Woodland Police 
Sgt. Larry Martinez, who developed a prototype of the device in his 
Sacramento-area community about four years ago. "They're just out there 
daydreaming. We see this as a gentle but effective reminder." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, should drivers disregard the hint or even choose to race by the 
device for fun, officers say there's no guarantee that a squad car won't be 
lying in wait nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have that fear working in our favor," said Deputy Don Blades, a traffic 
investigator at the City of Industry station. "But, really, enforcement is not 
the key. It's all about public awareness." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a fairly inexpensive, low-maintenance method to get speeders to slow 
down, police say. Many commercial devices, which sell for $6,000 to $7,000, are 
completely self-contained and run on solar power. 
</P>
<P>
City of Industry deputies, who built their own battery-powered unit with the 
help of local merchants, didn't spend a cent on it. A heavy equipment firm 
donated an old rusty trailer. A towing yard customized it for free. An 
electronics store donated the screen. Blades and a few other deputies simply 
hooked up the wires to a radar gun from an old patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a whole lot to it," Blades said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, communities that have had the units in operation give them high marks. 
</P>
<P>
Officers usually tow the trailers to problem thoroughfares and leave them there 
for anywhere from several hours to a full day. One glance at the screen, they 
say, and brake lights go on, traffic slows and some drivers clocked at high 
speeds even look as if they want to shrink in their seats. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't keep up with the demand to place it in everybody's neighborhood," 
said Livermore Police Capt. Otto Jiuliani, who began using a radar trailer last 
month. "We only have one. We just can't get it everywhere we want it." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Strickland, president of Mobile Traffic Zone Inc., a Woodland-based firm 
that has a patent pending on the devices, hopes they will soon be dotting the 
California landscape. 
</P>
<P>
While some might consider them just another example of Big Brother intruding on 
motoring freedom, Strickland sees the units as educational tools that encourage 
voluntary compliance rather than hard-nosed enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like looking at a big speedometer through your windshield," Strickland 
said. "You can't say you didn't know how fast you were going . . . and this way 
you can reprimand yourself."

OLD OLDS GETS CREDIT AFTER 14 SURVIVE PLUNGE INTO PIT 
</P>

Geneva White said that when she decided to drive home from a barbecue Monday 
night in her big, 18-year-old Oldsmobile sedan, it seemed as though everyone 
else at the party wanted a ride. 
</P>
<P>
"They all decided to come with me," the 32-year-old Lynwood mother of three 
said from her bed at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center on Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"We got in. Then, hell, everyone got in. There were 14 of us in that old 
Oldsmobile." 
</P>
<P>
With her daughters Shana, 13, and Etoria, 3; son Teron, 6; niece Lakeisha 
White, 8; friends Vanessa Burns, 34, and Deborah Gaston, 34, and an assortment 
of young friends and relations -- "I'm not sure who they all are, but there 
were 11 kids in there" -- all tucked inside the 1971 Delta 98, White turned 
east on 135th Street in the Compton area and headed for her home in Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angry Words Exchanged 
</P>
<P>
White said she was nearing McKinley Avenue, where a 70-foot-deep gravel pit 
flanks 135th Street, when three men in a red Mercury Capri pulled alongside. 
</P>
<P>
Angry words were exchanged between the two groups, but White said she does not 
remember which side started the feud. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why, but those men were angry," she recalled Wednesday. "Then all 
of a sudden, their car speeded up and cut into me. 
</P>
<P>
"They banged into me, and my car started sort of squirming," she added. "All of 
a sudden I went through the rail and I was headed straight down that cliff. 
Everybody in the car was hollering. All 14 of us. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was dead," she said. "I thought we all were dead. But I held it 
steady -- tried to drive it all the way down -- and thank God, the car didn't 
turn over." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vague Memory 
</P>
<P>
White said she does not remember hitting the bottom of the gravel pit, or 
climbing out of the car. She said she vaguely recalls pulling some of the 
children from the car, and starting the long climb back up the side of the 
quarry, before passing out. 
</P>
<P>
In what Compton police described as a "miracle," all 14 survived the violent 
plunge to the bottom of the pit, with most suffering only minor injuries. The 
"happy ending" was all the more surprising because no one was wearing a seat 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators expressed little optimism that they would find the three men or 
the car that struck White's. 
</P>
<P>
Burns was still hospitalized at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center on 
Wednesday with ankle and jaw fractures, and Gaston was still in fair condition 
at Harbor-UCLA with cuts and bruises, but most of the children had simply been 
treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
White, who was undergoing treatment at Harbor-UCLA for a severely bruised 
shoulder and cuts suffered when she bit through her tongue and lip, told a 
reporter that it was "that good old car" of hers that saved their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"You check out that Olds 98, honey," she said with a swollen grin. "It's a big 
car. And it's a strong one, too."

KRICKSTEIN REACHES U.S. OPEN SEMIFINALS WHEN BERGER QUITS

Consider now the Boris Becker serve. 
</P>
<P>
When struck, the ball travels with such speed that players who are not 
fortunate enough to hit it back often find solace in mere sightings. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Becker serving Wednesday night against Yannick Noah. 
</P>
<P>
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Want to see it again? 
</P>
<P>
Against Yannick it was supersonic. 
</P>
<P>
Becker blasted his way into the U.S. Open semifinals on the strength of his 
serve and simply overpowered Noah, another of tennis' power brokers, 6-3, 6-3, 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was easier than Becker ever thought it would be. But it was also about time. 
In his second-round match, Becker had to stare down two match points, and up 
until facing Noah, his play had been spotty. 
</P>
<P>
All that changed in 1 hour 56 minutes of a high-speed chase between Noah's 
racket and Becker's serve. Noah never caught up. 
</P>
<P>
Did he ever have a chance? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if you put the tape of the match back at the beginning and run it slow 
motion," Noah said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker served 13 games and never allowed Noah a break point. In fact, Noah 
managed only 11 points on Becker's serve in three sets of sheer agony. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost didn't make any mistakes," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he continued a remarkable stretch of success. Becker has won 26 of his 
last 28 matches since the French Open, losing only to Stefan Edberg in Paris 
and to Brad Gilbert in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Becker even won 79% of his second serves against Noah, who said he was sad 
about being unable to handle them. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen him play some great matches," Noah said. "You need two guys to 
play a great match. Tonight, he was pretty much by himself out there." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Becker will be joined by Aaron Krickstein, who won the other quarterfinal 
sooner than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Berger quit in the fourth set because of leg cramps, which sent Krickstein 
into the semifinals against Becker, where he gets his chance to put his racket 
on Becker's serves. 
</P>
<P>
Berger, who lost, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, 1-0, retired, was a bit too busy feeling sorry 
for himself to congratulate Krickstein. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say I'm happy for him because I'm not," Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
His muscle problems began in his left thigh and quickly moved south: calves, 
ankles, feet. All at once, Berger knew the end was here. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I ran, I got cramps," he said. "It would have been absolutely 
stupid to continue." 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein realized that something strange was going on with Berger in the 
fifth game of the third set. At the end of a long rally, Berger's legs seemed 
to give out and he went to his knees just as Krickstein sent a backhand down 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
Berger stood up but doubled over in pain. Chair umpire Michael Loo gave Berger 
a warning for delay of game and instructed Krickstein to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even going to serve, to tell you the truth," Krickstein said. "I 
served, but what was I going to do? I'm trying to win the match." 
</P>
<P>
So with his opponent barely able to stand, Krickstein used slice serves that 
bounced away from Berger and forced him to run. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that anyone else playing me wouldn't have mercy on me," Krickstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Berger did not win another point. He tried serving underhanded, but that didn't 
work. He wound up losing five consecutive games and retired following the first 
game of the fourth set, after a visit by the trainer did not help his cramps. 
</P>
<P>
For Krickstein, it is his first semifinal appearance in a Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that I was going to win anyway," Krickstein said. "That's the way the 
match was going." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Krickstein made it to the quarterfinals of the Open. He upset Stefan 
Edberg in the fourth round before losing to Darren Cahill in five sets. 
</P>
<P>
Becker reached the U.S. Open semifinals in 1986 and lost to Miloslav Mecir in 
five sets. Becker, who won Wimbledon this year, also reached the semifinals of 
the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
He closed out the first set against Noah in 32 minutes, breaking him at love 
for a 4-2 lead. He served an ace on set point. 
</P>
<P>
The second set also turned early, when Becker broke Noah in the fifth game as 
the Frenchman double-faulted on break point. A brilliant backhand pass down the 
line set it up for Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Becker served enough winners (36) and aces (three), and won so many points at 
the net (82% of his tries), that the Noah highlight film was short. 
</P>
<P>
That would be a lunging volley that left Noah flat on his stomach. The ball 
flew long. 
</P>
<P>
"There was not much I could hope for," Noah said. 
</P>
<P>
Few listened when Becker said it was all right for him to struggle early in the 
Open, as he did when Derrick Rostagno twice held match points against him. But 
Becker came through and now he may be saving his best for last. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are confident," he said, "good things will come."

Bart Giamatti, baseball commissioner and president of Yale in 1978-86, was laid 
to rest Wednesday after a private graveside service attended by his family and 
close friends. 
</P>
<P>
Burial was in the Grove Street Cemetery, traditional burial site for Yale 
presidents. Entrance to the cemetery was closely guarded during the service, 
and the gates were locked immediately after the mourners left. 
</P>
<P>
At least 50 relatives and friends, including Yale President Benno C. Schmidt 
Jr. and Mayor Biagio DiLieto, attended the 25-minute service. The Rev. Harry B. 
Adams, Yale chaplain, officiated. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, who was 51, died last Friday after suffering a heart attack at his 
summer home on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. He is survived by his wife, 
Toni, and three children, Marcus Bartlett, Paul Edward Valentine and Elena 
Walton Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
The service was kept private at the request of the family. A public memorial 
service is planned, but no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Giamatti's 18 predecessors as president of Yale are buried in the 
cemetery, which dates from 1796, but in no single area.

Two women were charged Wednesday with drugging Pedro Guerrero's drink and 
stealing $26,000 worth of items from the St. Louis Cardinals star in his hotel 
room last month, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Chronicle reported in today's editions that Hall of Fame pitcher 
Don Drysdale, now an announcer for the Dodgers, was victimized in a similar 
scam Tuesday night at the Westin Galleria Hotel. No charges were filed in that 
case, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents filed with the Harris County District Attorney's Office, 
Guerrero had his World Series ring, a wedding band and a Rolex watch stolen 
when the Cardinals were staying at the hotel Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Jackson, 27, and Diana Cox, 26, were charged with felony theft Wednesday 
after the theft was reported by Guerrero, the newspaper reported. Both women 
are still at large. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero, 33, did not play Aug. 28 against the Astros, the only game he has 
missed this season. He was treated at a hospital after suffering abdominal 
pains, and team officials said at the time that he may have gotten food 
poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Wednesday night by The Associated Press about the situation, Guerrero 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
"Pedro's story is that he invited them to his room for drinks. They left and 
then came back. The second time they were there he was groggy, but he saw them 
going through his luggage, but he couldn't do anything about it," Harris County 
assistant district attorney Alvin Nunnery was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Guerrero identified the two women from police mug 
shots sent to him in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale, 53, reported losing a Rolex watch and a ring. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the wackiest thing," Drysdale said Wednesday. "One minute I was talking 
to people in the bar. Then, I don't have the slightest idea what happened. 
</P>
<P>
The former Dodger pitcher said he could not elaborate because he was 
cooperating with a police investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a robbery ring around the mall (the Galleria), and the police are 
close to cracking it," Drysdale said. "I just fell in with two of them. I was 
drugged, and I can't say more than that."

Deion Sanders said goodby to the New York Yankees Wednesday night and left 
Seattle to join the Atlanta Falcons, with whom he reached a tentative contract 
agreement earlier in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons announced the agreement with the defensive back from Florida State, 
their No. 1 draft choice and the NFL's fifth pick overall, just as the Yankees 
were starting their game against the Mariners with Sanders as the left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
After striking out in the sixth inning, Sanders walked through the Yankees 
dugout, shaking hands, and then was seen heading for the locker room, carrying 
two bats and his glove. Luis Polonia replaced Sanders in the bottom of the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders kept the door open on his chance to play both sports. "Mr. (George) 
Steinbrenner has been very good to me, and I plan to come back next year. This 
has been a good experience for me." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders had wanted a six-year, $10.75-million contract. The Falcons had offered 
a five-year deal valued at about $4 million.

RUDY CHOY LOSES A JINX AND FINALLY GETS HAWAIIAN RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rich Roberts

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated time and again in his dream to set a sailing record from Los Angeles 
to his native Hawaii, Rudy Choy figured he was jinxed -- until he finally 
identified the jinx. 
</P>
<P>
He concluded that it must have been his old friend Bud Tretter, who not only 
helped him to prepare the Aikane X-5 catamaran for several attempts but sailed 
along as navigator. Tretter, who runs the Marina Shipyard in Long Beach, is an 
excellent sailor, but something always seemed to be going wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Choy failed in three other bids for the record since 1987, and this summer 
started three more attempts, with Tretter aboard, only to turn back with 
breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
On July 2, they were still five miles from Catalina when the headboard pulled 
out of the main sail. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, they were ready to go again by late afternoon, but charging at 22 
knots in a strong breeze out of the Los Angeles Harbor entrance to the starting 
line off Point Fermin, the sail track peeled off the boom. 
</P>
<P>
The next shot was on July 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was going great," Tretter said. "We were seven hours out and 125 
miles down track, averaging about 17 knots, when the starboard chain plate on 
the outboard side of the hull started lifting the deck and broke the shear 
clamp. So, we bail out again." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until Aug. 17 that they were able to try again. But Tretter couldn't 
go because of a scheduled court appearance, so he set the starting line off 
Point Fermin and through the week served as shore support for weather 
information. The court appearance was later postponed, but Tretter had already 
been left on the beach, gnashing his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Without him, Aikane X-5, the rising sun at its back, passed the Diamond Head 
finish line at 8:41 the morning of Aug. 24, completing the run in 6 days 22 
hours 41 minutes 12 seconds, beating the record of 7 days 7 hours 30 minutes 
set by the 64-foot catamaran, Double Bullet, in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Tretter, having flown over, greeted Choy at the finish and the next day was 
back on board for the weekly Friday night races out of the Hawaii Yacht Club. 
But the Hawaiian sailing gods were watching. 
</P>
<P>
Aikane X-5's mainsail blew out. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Choy is the pioneer of catamaran sailing. His co-skipper was son Barry, 
and the rest of the crew included Mike Elias, who replaced Tretter as 
navigator; mast man Gary Kraft, sail maker-helmsman John Conser, primary 
helmsman Roy Seaman and VHS operator Neal Forn. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Tretter deserves partial credit for the record -- and not just 
for staying off the boat. He helped Elias pick the best courses for Aikane X-5 
to sail. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in radio communication twice daily," Tretter said. "I would call our 
weather people at Ocean Routes in Sunnyvale, and Mike would call me after that. 
We'd hack over the weather and strategy for about an hour every morning and 
every night and, boy, it worked. 
</P>
<P>
"They sailed as close to a rhumb (direct) line course as I've ever seen. They 
had a few wind shifts, and the wind started lightening the second day from the 
finish. Otherwise, they would have beaten the record by 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Tretter said: "It was a pretty uneventful trip." 
</P>
<P>
Tretter said the winds blew a steady 15 knots, with gusts up to 22. 
</P>
<P>
Aikane X-5 averaged about 14 knots for the 2,250 miles. 
</P>

The National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s preliminary report on possible rules 
violations in the North Carolina State basketball program includes serious 
allegations but does not support claims of drug abuse or grade changing, Bruce 
Poulton, the school's outgoing chancellor, said. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released to reporters with the names of the players blacked out, 
focuses on claims that players sold complimentary basketball tickets and 
athletic shoes, received discounts not available to other students and accepted 
free food and lodging from athletic boosters.

QUEEN MARY, HAM OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS RADIO STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local amateur radio operators plan to meet with Queen Mary officials next week 
to discuss disagreements that resulted in this week's voluntary closure of a 
radio room that had operated continuously on the ship for 10 years. "I'm sure 
that everything will be ironed out," said Nate Brightman, manager of the 
station and a member of Associated Radio Amateurs of Long Beach, which operates 
it. 
</P>
<P>
According to Brightman, the ham radio station ceased operating Tuesday after 
the ship's managers urged club members to spend more time talking to shipboard 
tourists about amateur radio. While the club has no objection to talking to 
tourists and does so regularly, Brightman said, the discussion led to a 
"misunderstanding" about the station's autonomy, which he said is required by 
FCC regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're licensed as an amateur radio station," Brightman said. "If we don't 
operate autonomously, it will be an exhibit which (the ship) controls and (the 
ship) is a commercial venture. We could lose our license." 
</P>
<P>
The Queen Mary was recently acquired by a subsidiary of the Disney Development 
Corp., which is considering developing the site into a $1 billion marine 
oriented theme park. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now in accord with how the station should operate," said Brightman, 
predicting that the station -- which is well known to amateur radio enthusiasts 
throughout the world -- could be back on the air as early as next week.

SECESSIONISTS PRESENT PLANS

<TEXT>
<P>
Two resident groups seeking to withdraw from the Pasadena Unified School 
District presented their requests to the 11-member county Committee on School 
District Organization Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
One of the groups, representing residents along Rose Villa Street in an 
unincorporated county area between Pasadena and San Marino, wants the area 
annexed and children transferred to the San Marino school district. Residents 
say they identify more with San Marino than Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The second group -- representing Sierra Madre residents -- seeks to join the 
Arcadia Unified School District, saying they fear gangs and violence in the 
Pasadena schools. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will schedule public hearings in the district within the next two 
months and send a recommendation to the State Board of Education, said Mark 
Forgy, the committee's staff secretary. 
</P>
<P>
About four months later, the state board will hold hearings and decide whether 
to allow residents in the districts involved to vote on the matter, Forgy said. 
He estimated that the matter could come to a vote in November, 1990.

PROTECT ANIMALS FROM THE OCCULT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After reading about "born-again" Christian Randy Emon and his occult ideas, I 
am quite mystified how he is able to retain such a responsible job as a police 
sergeant in Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
According to the article, Emon believes his children have been possessed by 
demons. How many more children standing in the sergeant's path will be accused 
of these same "crimes"? 
</P>
<P>
Mention was made that two youths had mutilated around seven cats. The district 
attorney seems to have believed their act was "all a joke," to quote Glen 
Myers, Covina crime prevention officer. 
</P>
<P>
Killing cats is not a joke. Neither should be mutilation of other animals in 
the name of Santeria or any other perverse religion that allows such horrible 
practices. Let's put the blame where it belongs -- not on some medieval notion 
of satanic possession, but on religions that continue to practice animal 
cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Emon should be studying psychology instead of occultism, and he should be 
referring people who commit bizarre religious rituals to the nearest mental 
health clinic. In the United States we have freedom of religion, but cruelty to 
animals should and must have priority over religious incantations of a former 
uncivilized age.

STATE OPENS 2ND PROBE OF CAMPBELL AIDE 
</P>

<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating whether the top aide 
to state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) improperly disclosed a 
$20,000 loan -- apparently made at a below-market interest rate -- from a City 
of Industry firm that has been a political contributor to his boss. 
</P>
<P>
The state political watchdog agency investigation of Campbell aide Jerome M. 
Haleva comes less than a month after The Times disclosed that Haleva intervened 
on behalf of the firm, United Packaging Corp., with state contract officials 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue was raised, and we will review something if it appears to merit 
review," commission spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said Tuesday in confirming the 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Haleva placed a telephone call to John S. Babich, deputy director of the state 
Office of Procurement, in June, 1988, as United Packaging faced 
disqualification on a highly competitive $1.6-million contract to supply 
garbage bags to state agencies, public records show. United Packaging was the 
lowest bidder, but it would have been unable to provide the bags within six 
weeks of each order, as contract officials had specified. 
</P>
<P>
After the call, procurement officials rewrote the bid specifications to allow 
for a 12-week delivery time, and United Packaging won the state's business, 
public records show. 
</P>
<P>
The call from Haleva came 16 months after the company and its president, Frank 
Eugene Raper, had given Haleva a $20,000 loan at 8% interest -- 2% to 3% lower 
than what banks were offering the general public at the time. The loan, secured 
by a second trust deed against Haleva's home, was granted in February, 1987, 
and was either repaid or forgiven in early June, 1987, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Such a discount on a loan is generally considered a gift that therefore would 
be required to be disclosed on the yearly statements of economic interest 
required of politicians and their staff members. Haleva did disclose the loan 
in 1987, but he did not report having received a benefit in the below-market 
interest rate, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
Without discussing specifics, commission spokeswoman Michioku said the agency 
has the authority to investigate the possibility of a conflict of interest and 
failure to disclose financial dealings by legislative staff members such as 
Haleva. 
</P>
<P>
Michioku also said the loan inquiry is the commission's second to involve 
Haleva, whose annual salary is more than $90,000 and who is widely known for 
his political acumen. 
</P>
<P>
The first investigation, which is continuing, began earlier this summer after 
newspaper reports disclosed that Haleva and Campbell had failed to report 
receiving free use of a car and driver during the Republican National 
Convention in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The car, a Lincoln Continental, was provided by Asbestos Environmental 
Controls, a New Orleans firm that had sought Haleva's help when it encountered 
difficulties on a state contract last year. 
</P>
<P>
The firm had donated $27,000 to Campbell campaign funds during 1987 and 1988. 
It faced disqualification as an asbestos consulting firm because it had failed 
to properly submit certification papers to state officials. Haleva called the 
state architect's office and got a delay that allowed the company to file its 
certification and therefore retain more than $800,000 in state business. 
</P>
<P>
After the newspaper articles on the matter appeared, Haleva and Campbell 
amended their disclosure forms to report receiving $761 in transportation from 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
State records show that Raper has contributed $3,500 to Campbell since 1985 and 
that United Packaging gave Campbell a $100,000 campaign loan in October, 1986. 
The loan was made on Oct. 7 and repaid two weeks later with $349 in interest, 
documents show.

DIVERS FACE STERN OPPOSITION FROM NAVY ON REMOVING BARRIER TO COVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of scuba shop operators plan to ask the U. S. Navy to remove a fence 
that blocks land access to a popular Port Hueneme diving cove despite a diver's 
death there last week. 
</P>
<P>
They maintain that the cove off La Janelle Park at the south end of Silver 
Strand Beach is actually one of the safer and more scenic diving spots along 
the Southern California coast and that it should be open to the public, 
particularly for scuba diving instruction. 
</P>
<P>
But Naval Construction Battalion Center officials disagree. They said they 
replaced the vandalized 8-foot-tall chain-link fence along the base's southern 
boundary in April to prevent incidents such as the Aug. 29 drowning of 
18-year-old John Lowry. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not be receptive to the idea," said Kassandra Gale, a base 
spokeswoman. "I think the fence is a means of protecting the public from a 
dangerous situation, and the death just underscores that. It's apparently not a 
safe place to swim." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clear and Calm 
</P>
<P>
Some divers disagree, saying the cove is extraordinarily clear and calm and 
contains an abundance of sea life. They say the fence forces those who want to 
reach the cove to swim 75 yards through choppy waters from the park's public 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to swim around it once, and we almost got beat to death," said Kevin 
Bergamasco, 27, of Sylmar. "The water pushed us against the rocks." 
</P>
<P>
Divers who favor removing the fence blame Lowry's death on his inexperience. 
But authorities are divided on the question. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese, who investigated the Oxnard teen-ager's drowning, 
said that while Lowry had never dived before, conditions off La Janelle Park 
was as big a role in his death as was his inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
"The waters around there are extremely dangerous," he said. "Heavy currents 
come up and push you around." 
</P>
<P>
But Lt. Steve Giles of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, the diver who 
located Lowry's body, disagreed. "The area where he was diving was calm," he 
said. "It's not particularly dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Man-Made Peninsula 
</P>
<P>
Located at the entrance to the Port of Oxnard, the cove is immediately east of 
the park, a small man-made peninsula built on the remains of La Janelle, a 
467-foot luxury liner that slammed into the beach during a 1970 storm. 
</P>
<P>
After several divers died while exploring the ship's wreckage, authorities 
covered the ship with rocks and concrete. The resulting jetty hides the hulk 
and acts as an artificial reef, attracting sea life and protecting the cove. 
Meanwhile, millions of gallons of water flushing through the port because of 
tidal changes keep the cove unusually clean for waters so near shore. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably one of the prettiest places along the coast, and it's very 
safe," said Perry Ferguson, owner of a Channel Islands Harbor dive shop, Divers 
R Us, and a leader in the effort to remove the fence. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 scuba diving guide, "The Diving and Snorkeling Guide to Southern 
California," called it "Ventura's best dive spot, if not one of the best along 
the Southern California coast." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Students There 
</P>
<P>
Bill Miller, who coordinates Ventura College's scuba program, said he took his 
students there before opting for the Channel Islands, where visibility is even 
greater. "It's an excellent place to take beginners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical Saturday, more than 100 divers converge on the park, either 
exploring the cove's placid waters or diving in rougher waters off the three 
sides of the jetty that are exposed to the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said his group has decided to discuss their proposal at a Sept. 14 
meeting of the Ventura County Council of Divers. Still, some of the business 
owners acknowledged that they are fighting an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy certainly would be justified saying they don't want to open the fence 
after the death," said Roger McLaren, owner of Aquatics, a Port Hueneme dive 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be that the commander of the base doesn't understand how important this 
is to us," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Sheriff's Underwater Search and Rescue Team pulled Lowry's 
body from waters off the park in the late morning of Aug. 30. He was not 
wearing his mask and his mouth was gouged either before or immediately after 
his death, Breese said. 
</P>
<P>
Reported Missing 
</P>
<P>
While authorities do not know precisely how or where he drowned, they know 
where he began his first -- and last -- dive. Lowry had been reported missing 
Tuesday evening by two companions who apparently had watched him slip through a 
hole in the fence and dive into the cove's glassy waters with borrowed 
equipment, Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lowry's body was found outside the cove at a depth of about 75 feet, 
he may have drowned in its shallow waters and drifted into the deeper waters of 
the port's channel, said Giles, the sheriff's diver. 
</P>
<P>
Or he may have died after working his way into the unprotected waters on the 
jetty's other sides, where he had watched one of his more experienced 
companions dive earlier that afternoon, Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the circumstances, Gale said, the Navy, concerned about its liability 
when divers are exposed to danger on its property, plans to keep the fence. 
</P>
<P>
And officials at the Naval Ship Weapons Systems Engineering Station, which 
operates a weapons research facility on the cove's shore, are concerned about 
security. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our work is classified, and you can't have people drifting in and 
out," said station spokesman Russ Pyle. 
</P>
<P>
But divers counter that anyone who really wants to reach Navy property has only 
to swim from the public beach into Navy waters.

PLEDGES ADD $600,000 FOR CRISIS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A children's crisis center slated for construction at Camarillo State Hospital 
is expected to receive an important boost from two donors today. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald McDonald's Childrens Charities has pledged $300,000 to help build the 
facility, which is to cost $6 million to $10 million. Financier David Murdock, 
who built the luxury development of Lake Sherwood in Thousand Oaks, has also 
pledged $300,000, Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer said this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The generosity . . . has given a meaningful kickoff to a very important 
project to the victimized children of Ventura County," said Schaefer, who 
represents Thousand Oaks. "I wish there was no need for a facility of this type 
but sadly there is." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer and the donors will announce the grants today at the new Sherwood 
Country Club, which Murdock built as part of the Lake Sherwood development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
85 Children 
</P>
<P>
The proposed crisis center, called Casa Pacifica, would house as many as 85 
abused, neglected and abandoned children who are now placed in temporary foster 
homes or sit in police stations and other institutional settings while the 
county tries to find homes for them. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 70 abused or neglected children are placed in temporary foster homes 
each month, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the state Legislature approved a bill allowing Ventura County to 
build the center on 23 acres at Camarillo State Hospital. The 541-acre hospital 
property, which once housed about 7,000 patients, serves less than 1,200 
mentally ill and developmentally disabled patients. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors has earmarked $2 million to build Casa 
Pacifica. The Youth Connection, a private, nonprofit group that hopes to raise 
the balance, will start building the cottage-style facility in phases as money 
becomes available. Plans call for the Youth Connection to sublease the center 
from the county for a nominal amount and run it. 
</P>
<P>
The Ronald McDonald's Childrens Charities was founded in memory of Ray Kroc, 
who started the McDonald's restaurant chain. It awards grants to children's 
groups worldwide for health care, medical research, rehabilitation facilities 
and special education programs, and will donate $100,000 for each of three 
years to build Casa Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock, a high-profile developer in Ventura County, agreed to match the 
McDonald's grant, Schaefer said.

VOLUNTEERS ANSWER PHONE 'FRIENDLINE' FOR LATCHKEY KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As children returned to elementary school this week in the Bonita Unified 
School District, some old friends were waiting in the wings to lend a helping 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1988, 13 volunteers have run a "telephone friendline" 
for latchkey children -- youngsters who return to empty homes after school -- 
in La Verne and San Dimas. The volunteers do everything from reassuring 
children who are lonely to providing a sympathetic ear to students who are 
overwhelmed by the pressures of school. 
</P>
<P>
One volunteer recalls such a child who just couldn't handle the stress of a 
school assignment and dialed 596-PALS for help. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he had to look in a microscope and draw and label, and he couldn't 
get it done," said the Tele-Pal volunteer. "His mother just said he had to work 
harder and he could do it. He was so frustrated he called to share his 
feelings." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
840 Calls 
</P>
<P>
Such calls are all in a day's work for the volunteers at Tele-Pal, which is 
sponsored by the American Assn. of University Women of Pomona Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Since it started, the hot line has received 840 calls from students in seven 
elementary schools in the Bonita Unified School District. Its two phone lines 
are staffed from 2:30 to 3:30 p.m. Monday to Friday. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the hot line will also accept calls from sixth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers, many of them retired school teachers trained by the local 
police and social service workers, operate from a room at Hillcrest Homes, a 
retirement community in La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mostly kids who are lonesome and bored and needing to talk to an adult," 
said volunteer Juanita Wagner. Sometimes children call for help with homework, 
and the volunteers keep a dictionary on hand for callers wanting help in 
spelling. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of surrogate parents," Wagner said. "I feel for the kids and yet I 
know some parents just cannot afford to let kids have baby-sitters all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Empty Homes' 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize so many children returned to empty homes," said Cheryl 
Hlavety, president of the Grace Miller Elementary School PTA. Students from 
Grace Miller have placed more calls -- 122 -- than any other in the district. 
"I'm glad they used it rather than being home and scared," Hlavety said. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Leff, PTA president at Allen Avenue Elementary School, was also surprised 
that the hot line was used so much by the school's children. More than 100 
students have used the service since it was started. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't picture kids calling somebody they didn't know and talking," she 
said. "If I had it my way all mothers would stay home with their kids, but 
that's an old-fashioned opinion and not everybody can do it."

MALIBU CITYHOOD ELECTION A STEP CLOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two years of delays, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors this 
week scheduled a public hearing to set an election date for Malibu cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Incorporation backers were subdued at the news. Supervisors set the hearing for 
Oct. 19, the latest date possible, and there remains a possibility that the 
meeting could be postponed or taken off calendar by some unforeseen event. 
</P>
<P>
"We were here once before, but I'm glad we've got a date," said Carolyn Van 
Horn, co-chair of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation. "I just hope nothing 
happens before the 19th." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearing Date Canceled 
</P>
<P>
Last year, supervisors set a hearing date and abruptly cancelled it when a 
developer filed a lawsuit against the Local Agency Formation Commission, the 
state-mandated agency that approved Malibu's cityhood bid. The suit resulted in 
a yearlong delay and forced cityhood backers to spend nearly $20,000 for an 
environmental report to address the impact of the proposed city. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors had delayed any action on the cityhood proposal while they lobbied 
LAFCO to include a provision that would allow the county to retain jurisdiction 
over sewers in the seaside community for up to 10 years after incorporation. 
After LAFCO rejected the request twice, the panel reversed itself earlier this 
month and granted the county's wish. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that they have their 10-year jurisdiction, there's really no reason to 
delay it any longer," Van Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
The county approved a $43-million sewer system for Malibu in January against 
the wishes of thousands of residents in the community who believe it will lead 
to widespread development along the rugged coast. The sewer system must be 
approved by the California Coastal Commission, which will hold hearings on the 
plan beginning Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thousands Protested 
</P>
<P>
Angry residents launched the incorporation drive in October, 1987, when the 
county appeared ready to approve a massive $90-million sewer system for the 
community of 20,000 residents. When thousands protested the plan at a hearing, 
supervisors backed away from the proposal and agreed to accept the scaled-down 
version of the sewer that community leaders insist is still too large.

'OFF INTO THE WORLD' ON 1ST DAY OF SCHOOL 
</P>

<P>
There were a few tears and plenty of clicking cameras at Covina's Badillo 
Elementary School on the first day of classes. 
</P>
<P>
First-grader Kim Nguyen, sporting a brand-new ribboned white dress, said she 
was scared because she didn't know anybody at the school, but she was excited 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Nicole Hornstra, a second-grader wriggling under a knapsack 
on her back, declared that she wasn't nervous at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to having fun," she said, adding that reading is her 
favorite subject. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some of the parents were more distraught than their children. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Bayles, whose daughters were entering kindergarten and first grade, wept 
as she got them ready for school that morning. Armed with a video camera, she 
trailed after them as they entered their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really sad (with) them starting off into the world," Bayles said. "I'll 
miss them a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Jeannette Tufano, however, was excited that her 4-year-old son, Drew, was ready 
for school. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been wanting to go for a long time," Tufano said. She had already 
finished half a roll of film when she dashed into the classroom for one final 
picture, tickled to find Drew relaxing on a mat. 
</P>
<P>
Tufano's other son, Paul, was not thrilled, however, about losing his playmate. 
The 2-year-old suddenly darted in to give his big brother a good-by kiss. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been together all the time," Tufano said as she carried the whimpering 
Paul out. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gilmore took the morning off from work to be with his children on their 
first day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tradition," said Gilmore, who has one son in kindergarten and another in 
the first grade. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore hovered outside the classrooms with his wife, who was snapping 
photographs for the family album. He said the children had earlier been 
videotaped getting out of bed and preparing for the big day. 
</P>
<P>
"My 5-year-old was OK. It was mom that was scared," the beaming father said. 
Once the class started, Gilmore said, the kindergartner, Joseph, "turned his 
back on us and started to play ball." 
</P>
<P>
In the first-grade classroom, Gilmore's other son, Dustin, appeared eager for 
the session to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll get to meet a lot of new friends," said Dustin, sporting spiked hair 
after a summer of watching MTV. "I think it's going to be a pretty good year."

RIVALS ENGAGE IN BATTLES OF ATTRITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Tri-Valley League is off to inauspicious start. More coaches are busy 
counting the healthy than listing the talented. An all-star team can be formed 
in the nurses' offices of these bedroom communities. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened to America's youth?," St. Bonaventure Coach Damian Wilkerson 
asked. "If they're out there, there not playing football." 
</P>
<P>
Carpinteria, a two-time Southern Section champion, has the largest roster with 
41 players. Oak Park had the least on Tuesday when only eight healthy players 
showed up for practice. Fillmore recently raised its total to join St. 
Bonaventure with 30. Moorpark has 21 and Bishop Diego 17. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, most players will see plenty of playing time and several will 
rarely leave the field during the course of a game. 
</P>
<P>
The following is a look at the projected order of finish: 
</P>
<P>
Carpinteria -- It is hard to believe that Carpinteria would ever lose its 
stranglehold of the Tri-Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
Carpinteria has won or shared three Southern Section championships, two in the 
last two years, and has been to the championship game five times under 13-year 
Coach Lou Panizzon. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have won Tri-Valley titles in 1981, '86, '87 and '88 and have won 
15 consecutive league games over the past three seasons. Santa Ynez was the 
last league team to defeat Carpinteria, posting a 17-16 victory in the 1985 
season finale. 
</P>
<P>
Even more telling of Carpinteria's dominance has been its margin of victories. 
Last season, Carpinteria outscored its opponents 191-27. That was somewhat of a 
disappointing season for the defense, considering it allowed only one touchdown 
in 1987, when the Warriors scored 226 points and yielded 7. 
</P>
<P>
On offense, Coley Candaele returns for his third season as the starting 
quarterback. Candaele (5-foot-11, 165 pounds) passed for 1,630 yards and 24 
touchdowns last season and made first-team All-Southern Section. Candaele, the 
nephew of major league baseball player Casey Candaele, is also a standout 
distance runner. He placed second in 1,600 meters and sixth in the 800 in the 
state track championships last June. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the backfield also will be made up of returning starters. Senior 
tailback Jose Hernandez (5-9, 175) rushed for more than 700 yards and 11 
touchdowns and was an all-league selection. Senior Izak Ondre (5-8, 165) 
started at fullback for much of last season. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore -- The Flashes have perhaps the best chance of unseating Carpinteria 
and should improve on last season's record (6-4 overall, 3-2 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Chad Van Winkle (5-8, 165) helped Fillmore make a smooth transition 
to passing-oriented offense last season. Van Winkle set school records for 
passing attempts (173) and yardage (1,023) as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
The Flashes lost running back Anthony Chessani to knee surgery but have two 
experienced replacements. Hugo Virto (5-7, 175) rushed 53 times for 286 yards 
and Mike Kozar (5-11, 195) gained 158 yards in 26 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Junior halfback Tory Cabral (6-0, 180) is a strong runner and will be the focus 
of the ground game. Cabral helped Fillmore's junior varsity teams to undefeated 
league records and an overall mark of 17-3 the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Steve Palmer (6-1, 205) and tackle Ralph Meza (6-2, 270) were both 
all-league selections and will have to cover up for a relatively inexperienced 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore was shorthanded until the team's assistant coaches recruited 12 
players in three days to raise the roster total to 30. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened virtually overnight," Coach Curtis Garner said. "I feel a lot more 
comfortable with my team knowing that I have some depth. I think we'll be ready 
now to challenge for the league title." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark -- The Musketeers may have the second-best athlete in the league 
behind Candaele in quarterback Robert Hernandez (6-2, 170). He already has 
caught the attention of local college scouts. Now all he he needs is a receiver 
to catch his passes. Last season, Hernandez passed for 615 yards and two 
touchdowns but had a mediocre completion rate of 37% (56 of 151). Injuries 
already have taken a toll and Musketeers' backfield has been affected the most. 
Junior Tony Upshaw (5-10, 180) suffered a deep cut in his right foot and could 
be out for two weeks. Senior Jeff Cox (6-0, 200), a two-year varsity letterman, 
will move from fullback to tailback until Upshaw returns. He will be joined by 
third-string fullback Doug Frasco. Backup fullback/linebacker Tom Uphoff (5-11, 
190) suffered a torn quadriceps muscle in his right leg and also will be out at 
least two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Senior tackle Pedro Lozano (5-11, 230) and senior guard Victor Magdaleno (6-1, 
210) are Moorpark's strongest and best blockers and should provide better 
protection for Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark has not won a league championship since 1941. Last season, the 
Musketeers finished 1-9 and 0-5. Second-year Coach Rob Dearborn hopes to finish 
at least in the middle of the pack this season. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bonaventure -- The Seraphs will go through a rebuilding season after losing 
22 players from last year's team that finished 3-7, 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Senior quarterback Chris Conley (6-1, 185) was a part-time starter last season 
and led the team in passing yardage with 607. He also rushed for 62 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The other three returning starters are senior linemen -- tight end Chris 
Borchard (5-10, 185), tackle John Kistler (6-4, 220) and center Ryan Garcia 
(5-10, 230). 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Sam Monroe (6-0, 225) and split end Tom Marostica (5-11, 145) saw 
part-time duty last season. Marostica caught five passes for 85 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to utilize Chris Conley on the option as much as we can," 
second-year coach Damian Wilkerson said. "We'll sink or swim with him. He's all 
we have. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the players are big question marks." 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park -- After going 10-2 overall and reaching the second round of the 
playoffs, Oak Park expected to have a big turnout this season. Instead, the 
Eagles will be lucky to make it through the season without forfeitting any 
games. Coach Ron Veres said his team has lost eight players to injuries and may 
struggle to field 11 for its first game against Boron. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park does have some talented athletes when they are healthy. Kent Richter 
(5-9, 145), who sat out last season, will be the tailback. He was a member of 
the school's 400-meter relay team that placed second in the Southern Section 
1-A Division. Senior Carlos Pena (5-10, 185) earned all-league honors as a 
two-way lineman and will start at fullback. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Mike Stern (6-1, 185) will shift from receiver to quarterback. His main 
targets will be senior Mike Devine (5-11, 165) and junior Chris Ruhle (5-11, 
165). Senior Erikk Case (6-1, 175) and sophomore Jeff Gibbons (5-10, 165) are 
also receivers, but suffered injuries in practice. None have caught passes at 
the varsity level. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Diego -- Coach Norris Fletcher almost had to wait until next year before 
officially beginning his first season at the helm for the Cardinals. Bishop 
Diego, which has won one game in the last two years, also struggled to fill its 
roster. The Cardinals ended up with 17 players, including two sophomores and 
one 15-year-old freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the low turnout, the Cardinals have almost an all-senior starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The backfield consists of seniors Miguel Sanchez (5-9, 150) at quarterback, 
Sean Faitel (5-11, 170) at fullback and Joel Chenoweth (5-11, 155) and Aaron 
Baker (5-10, 160) alternating at running back. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hamilton (6-3, 160) and Keith Adett (5-9, 160) are the receivers.

SOME FINE LINES SEPARATE THE FAVORITES FROM TEAMS MIRED IN MIDDLE OF PACK 
</P>

<P>
The Thousand Oaks High football team was blissfully practicing early Monday 
evening when the roof caved in on USC during the fourth quarter of the Trojans' 
14-13 loss to Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Good thing. No sense worrying or drawing parallels the week of the Lancers' 
first game. 
</P>
<P>
So what if Thousand Oaks' fortunes depend on its brigade of returning defensive 
starters, just like USC's. So what if Thousand Oaks will send a rookie 
quarterback onto the field, just like USC. 
</P>
<P>
What could possibly go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, any Lancer who stayed up to watch highlights on the news witnessed 
how one weird break -- like a pass bouncing off a USC linebacker into the hands 
of an Illinois receiver -- can send a safe, conservative game plan exploding in 
a team's face. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Lancers' personnel dictates that a ground-oriented offense and a 
punishing, opportunistic defense is the script for the 1989 season. Thousand 
Oaks will put that theory to the test for the first time tonight at 7:30 
against visiting San Marcos in a nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
That script, in fact, could be expanded for just about the entire Marmonte 
League, which is populated with large, experienced linemen and small, 
inexperienced ballcarriers. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the league opens nonleague competition Friday at 7:30. Camarillo 
plays host to Oxnard; Channel Islands visits Rio Mesa; Newbury Park plays host 
to Agoura; Royal plays host to Chaminade at Simi Valley High; Simi Valley 
visits Ventura; and Westlake plays host to Buena at Thousand Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
A look at each Marmonte League team: 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks: Three Lancer defenders -- free safety Steve Rudisill, inside 
linebacker Lance Martin and cornerback Jimmy Magallanes -- might be the best 
the school has had at their positions, according to Coach Bob Richards. 
</P>
<P>
Rudisill was the league Defensive Player of the Year last season, and he and 
Martin were Times All-Ventura County choices from a Lancer team that finished 
second in the league and posted an overall record of 6-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive linemen Chris Foster, Nick Ochoa and Bassam Kneizeh are returning 
starters with outstanding quickness and strength. Linebacker Reggie Nelinger, 
whose brother Gus was an all-county linebacker for the Lancers, is another 
strong defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Mike Lindsay, who rushed for 1,046 yards last season, was expected to 
carry the offensive load. Lindsay injured a knee during the summer, however, 
and is out until midseason. Rudisill, a slashing runner lacking in experience, 
and sophomore Cory Bowen, a quick and tough runner with a low center of 
gravity, will share time until Lindsay returns. 
</P>
<P>
Foster and sophomore Dave Acosta are solid blockers at fullback and Nelinger 
gives the Lancers an excellent offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
The development of quarterbacks Scott Peterson and David Watts, both 
inexperienced juniors, will determine whether the Lancers are a dominant team 
or one that must rely on a stubborn defense. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands: The Raiders won their second consecutive league title last 
year, but have graduated most of their key personnel. If this year follows the 
recent pattern, Coach Joel Gershon will wave in the next bunch of seniors who 
will make up in size and talent what they lack in experience. 
</P>
<P>
Size? Frank Umu checks in at 6-foot-5 and 300 pounds. Jim Porter is 6-2 and 
230. Frank Ybarra is 6-1 and 240. None, however, started last season. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mark Contreras and wide receiver Shawn Young do give Channel 
Islands an experienced passing combination. Contreras platooned the past two 
seasons and Young led the Raiders with 16 catches for 336 yards last year. 
Young also plays defensive back, as will the other wide receiver, Chris 
Venturina. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing last year's potent backfield tandem of John Johnson and Jerry 
Williams will be tailback Renard Carn and fullback Pharoh Milner. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park: George Hurley has taken over the coaching reins and he has some 
big horses to pull the wagon. Joe Smigiel (6-5, 255), Jeff Jay (6-3, 235), Phil 
Pederson (6-1, 275) and Trevor Cull (5-11, 215) are two-way linemen with 
experience. Center Pat O'Neill (5-10, 202) will also play inside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jai Johnston gained about four games experience last season while 
playing for the injured Wayne Cook. His receivers should be fine, but the 
Panthers must establish a running game. They need a tailback to emerge if they 
are to better last season's 3-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake: Another first-year coach is Jim Benkert, who was offensive 
coordinator at Crespi during the Russell White glory years. Quarterback Todd 
Preston, a junior who passed for 1,149 yards last year, is the top returning 
quarterback in the league and should offer Benkert the ability to diversify his 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Benkert likes tailback Luke Crawford, who rushed for 111 yards in a part-time 
role last year. As usual, the Warrior line is smaller than that of most teams 
in the league. Westlake was 2-8 last season and hasn't qualified for the 
playoffs in six years. 
</P>
<P>
Royal: Gene Uebelhardt got the Highlanders turned about halfway around last 
season, his first as coach. Royal hasn't made the playoffs since 1983, but 
nearly qualified with a 4-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
Royal, like several other league teams, will rely on defense. Junior Tim Ross 
(6-4, 195) is a dominant player in the secondary and lineman Scott O'Neil is 
back after leading the team with seven sacks last season. Linebacker David 
Gnesda is also a solid player. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, an all-senior line will block for inexperienced quarterback 
Charlie Snyder and a trio of tailback candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo: Junior running back Kris Kirksey is unable to play because of an 
injured right knee, so the Scorpions will be in the same defense-oriented boat 
as most teams in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo, which squeaked into the playoffs despite a 4-7 overall record, 
boasts a senior-dominated offensive line that averages about 230 pounds. But to 
put the team's offensive problems into perspective, consider that senior tight 
end Scott Foster is the best skill-position player. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Greg Exler should grind out some yardage and quarterback candidates 
Matt Brimigion or Corey Tucker could balance the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley: The Pioneers were winless last year. But Eric Hale (6-5, 220), a 
talented athlete who can play quarterback or running back, is expected to 
provide some offensive punch this season. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Burroughs, Gary Mitsven and Ralph Huerta are returning starters on the 
offensive line.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
REGION'S FOOTBALL TEAMS HAVE SEEN HIGH TURNOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The coaching turnover trend continues at a high rate in Southeast/Long 
Beach-area high schools this fall. One-third of the area's 39 head coaching 
positions have been vacated since last year. In the past six years, 69 jobs 
have changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more interesting changes for 1989: 
</P>
<P>
* Bellflower High will not have a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
* Artesia's Norm Flowers has the head job after sharing it last season. 
</P>
<P>
* Three head coaches in other sports have been given extra duties as football 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
* Wayne Manzo jumps from Cerritos to La Serna. 
</P>
<P>
Bellflower thought it had solved its vacancy when it hired Jim Wright from a 
high school in Arizona. But Wright had second thoughts. Football practice 
opened without a coach, and school officials now say the Bucs will be handled 
by three assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Tereschuk (baseball) of California, Mark Rose (track) of Lakewood and 
Harold Eggers (boys volleyball) of Cerritos have all been appointed to 
additional roles as head football coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The naming of Flowers at Artesia is the third coaching change in three seasons 
for the Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
Manzo joins former Cerritos baseball coach Vern Brock at La Serna. Brock is the 
school's athletic director and baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Two trends remain fairly constant: St. Anthony has a new coach (Ralph Godfrey) 
for the seventh time this decade. Ken Davis, dean of area coaches, begins his 
18th season at Schurr. 
</P>
<P>
The number of coaching changes in the Southeast/Long Beach area is higher than 
in other areas of Southern California. Orange County, which has 28 schools, 
loses five to seven coaches a season, most from firings, according to figures 
compiled by The Times. This fall eight new coaches debut in the San Fernando 
Valley, which has about 50 schools. In other areas the turnover rate averages 
about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches in the Long Beach/Southeast area often cite burnout, the desire to move 
on to more prestigious positions, long hours and substandard pay as reasons for 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>

John Johnson knew he made the right decision the first time he carried the ball 
for Ventura College in a scrimmage Saturday against Hancock College.

Johnson, a former Channel Islands High standout, burst through a hole in the 
line and ran 60 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
On his next carry, Johnson was tackled behind the line of scrimmage for a 
three-yard loss. But it didn't matter. Johnson was excited to be back in 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe how good it felt to run the ball again," Johnson said. "It 
was excitement all over again, just like my junior year." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who ranks third all-time among Ventura County rushers, had planned to 
sit out this football season and concentrate on baseball at Ventura. The 
Seattle Mariners selected Johnson in the 54th round of the June amateur draft 
and promised him a signing bonus if he had an all-star season. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a middle infielder, closed his high school baseball career at Channel 
Islands by batting .412 in 24 games. He also had five home runs and 15 runs 
batted in. Not exactly star material, but he showed potential. 
</P>
<P>
If he played football, Johnson reasoned, he might jeopardize a baseball 
contract by missing too many games, and he also would risk his athletic career 
if he reinjured his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Then Johnson saw his friends tossing a football around. When practice began at 
Ventura College, Johnson watched through a chain-link fence. He talked to his 
friends and his family, then changed his mind. His brother, Steve Johnson, 
Ventura College's Most Valuable Player in 1984, gave the deciding sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother told me to go through life without any regrets," Johnson said. "He 
said I might regret never playing football again and he was right. The more my 
friends talked about it and the more my family brought it up, the more I wanted 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't stand it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Pirate Coach Phil Passno, under pressure to find another running back, heard 
the good news about Johnson on Aug. 29. In three days, Johnson learned the 
offense and Friday began practicing with the team. The next day he played in 
the scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
"He provides an ingredient to this team that we need in our backfield," Passno 
said. "It was his decision. The coaches did little to influence his decision." 
</P>
<P>
But, the coach added, "We're really happy to have him on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson rushed four times in the scrimmage for 88 yards. He is expected to 
alternate with returning tailback Ryan Rapoza in Saturday's opener against 
Porterville. The game will be played at either Ventura's Larabee Stadium, if 
the lights are installed, or at Rio Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave an impressive performance in our scrimmage," Passno said of Johnson. 
"The quickness was there and his knee doesn't seem to bother him. I expect him 
to have about 15 carries in our first game." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson ran for 3,485 yards in his three-year career at Channel Islands. He was 
expected to surpass Marc Monestime of Thousand Oaks as the county's all-time 
leading ground-gainer during his senior season. But Johnson reinjured his right 
knee in the first Marmonte League game against Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
He underwent his second knee operation and missed one game, finishing with 
1,185 yards and eight touchdowns. He failed to pass even his brother, Hilria, 
for second on the county list but he did set a county mark in scoring with 264 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson then lost interest in football and did not play in the Ventura County 
all-star game during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost the joy of scoring touchdowns and the joy of playing with my teammates 
when I got hurt the second time," Johnson said. "I spent most of my time 
rehabilitating my knee and I lost touch with my teammates. It was a very lonely 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson signed a letter of intent with the University of Arizona, but lost his 
freshman eligibility when he failed to meet NCAA Proposition 48 standards. At 
Ventura College he hopes to earn a second chance to play for the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of wonder how I would do at that level of competition," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have gone to Arizona and lost a year of eligibility. But I wanted a 
chance to play, whether it was baseball or football. I have no regrets. 
Hopefully, in a year or two, I will be playing there." 
</P>
<P>
But for now, Johnson will be carrying the offensive load for the Pirates.

GARRISON KEILLOR: HE'LL TAKE MANHATTAN; 
</P>
<P>
'LAKE WOBEGON' AUTHOR SAVORS ANONYMITY OF LIFE IN NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID STREITFELD, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's clear to me that when people read my books they like me a little less at 
the end than at the beginning. My fourth book, 'Company A, Chaaaaaaarge!,' is 
evidently the worst. Nobody bought it at all." 
</P>
<P>
So says Western author Dusty Pages, also known for "Wagons Westward!!! 
Hiiiii-YAW!" and "Pa! Look Out! It's-Aiiiiieee!" At book signings, Dusty keeps 
waiting for readers to come up and declare, "Your book saved my life, Mister," 
but instead only gets asked: "You wouldn't know where the little boys' room is, 
wouldja?" 
</P>
<P>
Dusty is a character in a sketch by Garrison Keillor, and it wouldn't be unfair 
to see a trace of his creator in him. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Keillor was a genuine folk hero, one who had risen to 
prominence not through media machinations or by purveying trash but with the 
slenderest reed possible: his voice and the simple, seemingly artless tales he 
told with it. People held "Prairie Home Companion" parties. When the show was 
on, they turned their phones off. Almost single-handedly, he made Minnesota 
chic. "Lake Wobegon Days" became one of the biggest best sellers of the decade, 
and Keillor was on the cover of Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All the Wrong Moves 
</P>
<P>
Even then, his status might have survived, but the wrong things happened. He 
left his longtime companion and producer, to whom he had lovingly dedicated 
"Lake Wobegon Days," for the Danish woman who had been a foreign exchange 
student in his high school graduating class 25 years before. He gave up the 
show to move to Denmark, where he seemed to stay only long enough to change 
planes. Resettled in New York, he quickly announced a series of farewell tours. 
He published two more books in quick succession. Now he's going back on the 
radio on a regular basis this fall with a new series, "Garrison Keillor's 
American Radio Company of the Air." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly anyone thinks of him as a folk hero anymore. Now he's just a writer, and 
it's fashionable not to be crazy about him. Even Minnesota has dropped off the 
nation's "in" lists. And while Keillor still has a comparatively large audience 
-- his latest book, "We Are Still Married," spent 13 weeks on the best-seller 
list -- he knows his popularity peak is past. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never have a book again that sells a third as many copies as 'Lake 
Wobegon,' and how could one possibly be dismayed by that?" Keillor asks, 
sitting in a grungily upscale breakfast joint near his Manhattan home. "To have 
your success behind you is the most calming, most peaceful feeling. Why should 
one ever want to repeat something so tumultuous -- this catastrophe of good 
fortune? 
</P>
<P>
"You don't believe me, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Keillor, who looks as if he just woke up, is nothing if not believable. Eating 
a bagel about the size of a life preserver, he explains the love he feels for 
his adopted city and talks obliquely about fame. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tremendous Frustration 
</P>
<P>
In Denmark, he felt a tremendous frustration from being in the middle of a 
great tale he could not tell -- the story of his rise and the intrusions of 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think it's such an interesting story," he says earnestly. "But I 
wouldn't, I couldn't trust myself to tell it. I had ulterior motives of 
punishing the wicked and lifting up the righteous, and no writer with any sense 
would go and do a story with his armor on. Stories can only be written naked." 
</P>
<P>
Still, from the cheeky title on down, "We Are Still Married" seems filled with 
little riffs of Keillor writing about what happened to Keillor. You don't have 
to know the inside story to get the joke, but it adds to the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Take his well-known distaste for what he sees as invasions of his privacy -- 
especially pesky questions from reporters and everyone else about his personal 
life. "I don't appreciate a book that's packed full of people grumbling at me," 
he writes in the story "My Life in Prison." There was a real book that did 
exactly this, "The Man From Lake Wobegon," by Michael Fedo, but Keillor gives 
it the pseudonym "Geek: An Unauthorized Biography of You Know Who (The Big 
Jerk)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Believe Me, I Know' 
</P>
<P>
In "Your Book Saved My Life, Mister," there's this: 
</P>
<P>
"I know what it's like to be disappointed by a hero. You think I don't know? 
Believe me, I know. I met my idol, Smokey W. Kaiser, when I was twelve. . . . I 
had waited outside the YMCA in Des Moines for three hours while he regaled the 
Rotary with humorous anecdotes, and when he emerged at the side door, a fat man 
in tight green pants tucked into silver-studded boots, he looked down and 
growled, 'I don't sign pieces of paper, kid. I sign books. No paper. You want 
my autograph, you can buy a book. That's a rule of mine. Don't waste my time 
and I won't waste yours.' 
</P>
<P>
"Smokey's problem," the narrator concludes, "was that he was a jerk." 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the list of forthcoming Keillor books opposite the title page, 
including "Shawn of the New Yorker" and "What Will Our World Be Like in the 
Year 1990?" None of these books will appear, of course, at least not from him. 
But in the year 1990, he expects his life to be much the same: living in his 
cherished New York and writing. 
</P>
<P>
"New York," Keillor says in a voice that no one would quite describe as 
sweet-sounding but that has had all the rough edges, all the Midwestern tang, 
worn away by years of broadcasting, "is the only place in this land of ours for 
a writer to live and feel normal about being a writer." 
</P>
<P>
Now, you may be thinking that only a very successful writer would say this 
about New York -- someone with a BMW, and standing reservations at fancy 
restaurants, and a multiroom apartment with a maid and a view of the river. But 
even if Keillor could have all this and much more, his feelings for the city go 
further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's Anonymous 
</P>
<P>
He's almost anonymous here. In a metropolis where even Jackie Onassis goes 
mostly unhassled, Keillor escapes notice. He looks like a car mechanic who is 
amiable but a little slow, and even as he takes time out to correct some galley 
proofs of a forthcoming New Yorker story, the diners in the surrounding booths 
ignore him. Snatches of their conversations -- "If he's stupid enough to get 
himself in trouble . . . " "Well, you were staring at the ambulance . . . " -- 
drift over, but these tales of woe go unheeded. Finally, satisfied, Keillor 
looks up. 
</P>
<P>
"By George, it's a good piece of work," he proclaims. "Now I've got to go 
convince him I've been struggling with this for hours." He moves off slowly to 
look for a phone. Keillor does good pieces of work. If "We Are Still Married" 
had come from a newcomer, its humor and cleverness would be marveled over. 
"Lake Wobegon Days" isn't talked about much any more, but the book seems likely 
to become a classic, read long into the 21st Century. And moving has recharged 
his literary batteries. The city has reignited old passions -- for baseball, 
newspapers (as long as they're not writing about him), trains. At times, in 
fact, Keillor's New York boosterism threatens to resemble New York Mayor's Ed 
Koch's famous criticism of rural life. "If you live your quiet noble life in 
Vermont," Keillor declares, "I hope you like trees a lot. I hope you enjoy 
putting your arms around them, and talking to them." 
</P>
<P>
As opposed to Koch, Keillor says this so gently even a Vermonter couldn't take 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can talk about is what I see. People who talk about the fear on the 
streets and the drug problem and so on are talking about things that 
undoubtedly are true, but most of them are talking about things that are not 
their own experience. They're talking about stories that they've read in the 
paper. Part of the purpose of the press in all of its history has been to scare 
us, to our delight."

MELLOW DESIGNER FASHIONS WILD AND CRAZY CLOTHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE SCHLOSBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Stokes' voice is so soft and her demeanor so reserved, you'd think the 
Woodland Hills clothing designer specialized in pleated skirts, paisley blouses 
and navy blazers. 
</P>
<P>
But Stokes' personality and fashions don't quite match. Stokes goes for gold 
sequined bustiers, mile-high shoulder pads and ruffled organza miniskirts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not as wild as all of these," she said, pointing to the dozens of glitzy 
garments hanging on racks in her living room. "People think that's where I 
become talkative, and I guess that's true. The crazier it is, the more fun I 
have making it." 
</P>
<P>
Stokes, 35, has been having bolts of fun lately. Her flashy, futuristic 
fashions have earned her increasing recognition among a celebrity clientele, 
and she says her company, LSO Designs (Linda Stokes Originals), is growing 
rapidly. Her clothes are modeled in fashion shows about once a month. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes makes and sells her garments out of her home, but she hopes to open her 
own boutique by year's end. Her designs should be available in retail stores 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to carry her line," said Maria Atanasio, owner of 818 Freight, a 
large boutique in Woodland Hills. Atanasio says 
</P>
<P>
that she has just expanded her store to include black-tie garments and that 
Stokes' designs will fit right in. 
</P>
<P>
"Linda is really on a couture level," Atanasio said. "She has a very good eye 
for color and style. In this business, you see a lot of people come and go, and 
many copy their designs. It's hard to find a designer who is really a creator, 
and Linda definitely is." 
</P>
<P>
Designing for both dressy and casual occasions, Stokes uses a variety of 
fabrics -- silk, cotton and wool among them -- and decorates many of her 
garments with leather and snakeskin appliques. She also makes earrings and 
covers shoes to match her designs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been willing to go a little further," she said. "I've taken a lot 
of chances, gone way out." 
</P>
<P>
Too far out for some, perhaps. Stokes would eventually like upscale department 
stores to carry her line. But she said buyers have asked her to alter her 
designs. "I'm not ever going to do that," she said. "Not for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Stokes' garments sell from $200 to $1,800 and rent for $50 to $150 a day (about 
25% of her business). Spokesmen for several department stores said similar, 
handmade items typically run from $1,000 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of four teen-agers, Stokes works on her designs almost every day, 
sometimes for up to 18 hours. She and her six employees can make most dresses 
in about three hours (her living room is full of sewing equipment, fabrics and 
racks of clothing), although designs with beads can take more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes does much of the sewing herself, which she says is unusual. "Most of the 
designers I know will just sketch," she said. "Most of your big designers can't 
sew." 
</P>
<P>
Stokes, a Detroit native, learned to sew in a junior high home economics class. 
It wasn't long before she was making prom dresses for her friends. After high 
school she moved to New York to attend the Pratt Institute of Fashion, but six 
months later she was bored and moved back to Detroit. "I was already beyond 
that point, and I was too anxious to work." 
</P>
<P>
Stokes and her family moved to Woodland Hills six years ago. They chose the San 
Fernando Valley because it is a "peaceful atmosphere for kids," but most of 
Stokes' clients live in Beverly Hills. "My clients are always asking for me to 
move," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Close to Home' 
</P>
<P>
She says she will probably open her first boutique in Beverly Hills, but would 
like to open a store in the Valley too. "I'd like to be close to home because 
that's where I'm comfortable," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes has built a clientele primarily through connections in the entertainment 
industry. Her husband Michael is a record producer for Motown, and she is part 
of an R &amp; B singing duet called Magic Lady, which has issued three albums 
and toured Europe. 
</P>
<P>
One of Stokes' best customers is Marla Gibbs, star of NBC's "227." Gibbs met 
Stokes five years ago at a charity fashion show. "We all fell in love with her 
clothes," said Gibbs, who recently wore a Stokes design -- a full-length purple 
knit dress with gold and silver appliques -- for a scene in "227." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs says Stokes is very easy to work with. "She's very quiet and shy, but 
she's confident about her fashions. And she's very good about matching your 
personality. I get a lot of compliments, and she gets a lot of business." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sewing for celebrities, Stokes has made prom dresses for 
students at Taft, Reseda and Chatsworth high schools. However, she does offer 
special prices for high school students: $150 to $300.

THE NEW TV SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
LASSIE COMES HOME -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since "Lassie" was taken off the air 18 years ago, dog trainer Bob 
Weatherwax has been patiently breeding and training look-alike collies in 
preparation for the day Lassie would come home . . . to television. 
</P>
<P>
That day is almost here. On Sept. 23, MCA-TV's revival of the television 
classic will make its debut on KHJ-TV Channel 9. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-year-old collie that stars in the new syndicated "Lassie" series is the 
seventh direct descendant of the original Lassie, which was trained by 
Weatherwax's late father, Rudd, and which first appeared with Elizabeth Taylor 
and Roddy McDowall in the successful 1943 movie "Lassie Come Home." 
</P>
<P>
The film was based on Eric Knight's best-selling 1940 novel about a poor 
country family forced to sell their faithful collie, which then overcomes 
incredible odds and distances to return home to them. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the female Lassie character, Weatherwax's dogs -- all males because they 
are easier to train -- have never strayed from their master's side. During the 
dog's TV hiatus, Weatherwax and his father groomed the canine celebrity in 
personal appearances at fairs, rodeos and dog shows, with appearance fees as 
high as $7,500. Weatherwax says that Lassie often created a greater stir with 
collie owners than children. 
</P>
<P>
"The collie people at the dog shows would always tell us, 'You know, you have a 
flawed collie; he would never win any awards,' " Weatherwax said. "One day my 
father, who grew tired of those comments, reached into his pocket and held up 
some money. 'You go ahead and collect the blue ribbons,' he said. 'I'll keep 
collecting these ribbons.' " 
</P>
<P>
The point of contention for purebred collie owners is Lassie's unusually blond 
coat, which Weatherwax obtains by bleaching, and his nose. A tell-tale white 
blaze of fur runs up Lassie's nose -- traditionally an undesirable trait in 
show collies. But that familiar white streak is Lassie's trademark, and the 
Weatherwaxes have taken great care to breed it in their collies. 
</P>
<P>
"During a period of 45 years, we've raised over 3,000 puppies to get the seven 
Lassies we've had," Weatherwax said on the "Lassie" set at Universal as he 
flipped Lassie a small bit of cooked steak in reward for a string of tricks the 
dog had just performed. Weatherwax claims that Lassie knows about 90 verbal 
commands and hand signals. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how hard it is to find dogs with those markings. My father would go out 
and find suitable female collies and make a deal with the breeder for pick of 
the litter. The dog we have now took three years and 10 litters to find." 
</P>
<P>
Weatherwax -- who operates Weatherwax Trained Dogs with 25 canines of varying 
breeds -- claims he has already received several letters of protest from 
members of the Collie Club of America since the new "Lassie" show was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
"They blamed me for making collies too popular once before," Weatherwax said. 
"I think now they're afraid people who want collies with white markings will 
start tampering with the breed all over again." 
</P>
<P>
But Sally Futh, the collie club's president, said that times have changed and 
that collies with light-colored manes and nose blazes have placed well in 
competition -- although such dogs are still rare. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend in dog ownership has been away from dogs like collies," she said. 
"Collies are dottering around with virtually the same registration figures they 
had before the original Lassie movie. (There are about 25,000 collies 
registered each year.) Lassie created a definite upsurge and probably made the 
breed too popular for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Weatherwax learned to train Lassie from his father, who caused rivers of tears 
when he taught Old Yeller to roll over and die in the 1957 Walt Disney film. 
Rudd was raised on a ranch in Mexico where his father taught him how to train 
dogs to herd sheep. 
</P>
<P>
"When my father and his brother went to the market, they taught one of the dogs 
to follow a few feet behind them and steal apples from the bins when they 
snapped their fingers," Weatherwax said. "That way they wouldn't get into 
trouble because they could just blame the dog if they got caught." 
</P>
<P>
The Weatherwax family moved to California and Rudd gave acting a try. When 
called to play a paperboy, Rudd surprised the director by training a dog to 
take the newspaper from him, run up and deposit it on the porch. The dog stole 
the show, and the next day the director fired Rudd and hired the dog. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Rudd began training dogs for motion pictures. In 1942, Weatherwax 
said, his father got a call from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which had just auditioned 
1,500 collies for "Lassie Come Home." They needed a trained collie to back up 
their star dog. Rudd was never partial to collies, but he did have one left to 
him by a man who had hired Rudd in an unsuccessful effort to break his dog of 
chasing motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
"His name was Pal," Weatherwax said, "and he had mange. Pal was going to be 
used in a scene where the script called for Lassie to come out of a river 
exhausted. My father interpreted it and designed a scene where Pal walked out 
of the river and without shaking the water off himself collapsed to the ground. 
The director stood up and said, 'Lassie is out and Pal is in.' " 
</P>
<P>
Pal, renamed Lassie, received an MGM contract and went on to do a series of six 
successful feature films. In his heyday, the dog received a star on the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame and had his paws dipped in cement in front of Grauman's 
Chinese Theater. Lassie was one of MGM's top moneymakers in the 1940s, grossing 
more than $250 million, according to Weatherwax. 
</P>
<P>
When MGM dropped Lassie's contract in 1951, Weatherwax said the studio owed his 
father $17,000. Rudd bargained with MGM, forfeiting his money for rights to the 
Lassie name and image. 
</P>
<P>
The move paid off. When Rudd gave Lassie the command to jump to the television 
screen, he lasted there for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The dog was a better actor than the people most of the time," recalled Tom 
Rettig, 47, who played the original TV boy, Jeff Miller, from 1954 to 1957. 
</P>
<P>
"On a regular basis, one of the human actors would blow a line, or do something 
that meant we had to shoot another take. It seems that Lassie, who always had 
things right the first time, would look at us like, 'Would you get it right 
this time?' "

Actor Jon Provost took over as Lassie's young master for seven years beginning 
in 1957. "The dog was always the biggest star in the show," said Provost, now 
39, who will return to the new show in a recurring role as a family relative. 
</P>
<P>
"In the original series, we did a scene where Lassie and I were on a river 
raft," he said. "The raft broke up in the rapids and we fell in the water. They 
had a safety line across the river with three men who jumped in and rescued 
Lassie. Meanwhile, I was going down for my third gulp. The crew was just 
standing on the shore looking at me saying, 'Wow, what great acting!' Finally 
Rudd Weatherwax saw I was in trouble and his men jumped in to save me." 
</P>
<P>
The original "Lassie" series, which won three Emmy Awards for children's 
programming, is in syndication on Nickelodeon. 
</P>
<P>
MCA-TV's new "Lassie" is set in a big-city suburb where the dog will confront a 
modern set of problems ranging from drugs to animal rights. The cast includes 
Dee Wallace Stone, Christopher Stone, Will Nipper and Wendy Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Weatherwax, who inherited the rights to Lassie from his father, now works 
alongside his 25-year-old son, Bob Jr., the handler of Lassie's double -- named 
Roxy -- who is used for the more difficult scenes on the new series. Roxy has 
Lassie's familiar nose blaze but only one white front paw, so the dog must wear 
a white fur sock before the camera. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have any brothers or sisters; I grew up with a family of collies," 
Bob Jr. said, gently stroking Roxy's thick mane. "I remember when I was 3 years 
old, I tried drinking out of a water dish because that's what all the dogs 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Weatherwax said he will work a dog for only a few years in production because 
it is such a demanding experience. If the new "Lassie" series is successful, 
Weatherwax plans to start grooming an eighth-generation Lassie puppy soon to 
bear the burden of stardom.

KCET TO DROP MAGAZINE; LOW AD SALES CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KCET Channel 28 and Knapp Communications confirmed Wednesday that KCET 
Magazine, the station's 21-month-old monthly program guide, will cease to exist 
in its current form at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the public-television station and at Knapp said the two companies 
are working together on a less sophisticated program guide that will replace 
the magazine next January. 
</P>
<P>
"The magazine was not as strong a commercial venture as expected," said Joy 
Sabol, spokeswoman for Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp, which also publishes Architectural Digest and Bon Appetit, had hoped to 
recoup its investment in the magazine through ad sales. But that wasn't 
happening -- the current 48-page issue contains only about seven pages' worth 
of ads -- and Knapp was losing money on every issue, Sabol said. 
</P>
<P>
KCET pitched in 25 cents per subscriber each month -- nearly $900,000 a year -- 
but that and the meager ad revenues, according to Sabol, were not enough to 
cover Knapp's costs. The magazine is circulated to about 295,000 KCET 
subscribers who donate at least $40 a year to the station. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's demise came just one day after the station acknowledged that it 
had canceled a gala event it had planned to stage at the Hollywood Bowl on 
Sept. 28 to celebrate KCET's 25th anniversary. Ironically, the event is touted 
in a full-page ad on the inside cover of this month's edition of KCET Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"KCET Magazine is too expensive for Knapp to publish for us," KCET spokeswoman 
Barbara Goen said Wednesday. "They have presented us with several options, and 
we are in the process of evaluating our options. We will do a program guide of 
some form." 
</P>
<P>
Goen said that Knapp has suggested publications of "lesser sophistication" than 
the current magazine and that the station would decide what direction to go in 
by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
She said KCET officials had not yet determined whether they will have to invest 
more in this new venture than they have in the past. 
</P>
<P>
KCET Magazine contains listings of KCET's program schedule and an assortment of 
articles about upcoming programs and more general subjects such as travel, 
dining and the arts. It was launched in January, 1988, to replace Dial, public 
television's program guide that was distributed and produced by public TV 
stations in 12 cities. Dial, which was also advertiser-supported, also became 
too expensive for the stations to produce. 
</P>
<P>
For a short time last year, KCET Magazine was sold for $1.50 a copy at 
newsstands, but that experiment failed to increase circulation or advertising 
revenue significantly. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of another public-television program guide raises the question of 
why KCET needs to invest money in its own publication when its programs are 
routinely listed in TV Guide and local newspapers. Wouldn't such monies be 
better invested in programming? 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good question," Goen said. "But our research and focus-group studies 
and conversations with our subscribers have given us the impression that our 
subscribers want a communication device from KCET. We believe it enhances their 
feelings and their connection with KCET."

TEACHER OF YEAR NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Teacher of the Year is a music teacher who is nicknamed Julie 
Andrews by her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Toni Staser, who teaches music at El Rodeo School, was given the honor at a 
district orientation Wednesday. A 12-year veteran of the Beverly Hills Unified 
School District and a mentor teacher, she helps put on student programs in the 
spring and winter. Music, she says, is "one subject that every child has a 
natural love for." 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old teacher attended USC on an organ scholarship and does bear some 
resemblance to the "Sound of Music" star. Selected by a committee of teachers, 
administrators and employees, Staser was modest in accepting her plaque. "You 
can't single out anyone. . . . This was my lucky year." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Nawa, secretary to head counselor Patsy Carter at Beverly Hills High 
School, was named classified employee of the year. Carter cited Nawa for her 
dedication and hard work, which includes processing the "1,000 grade changes a 
year" and proofreading names on diplomas.

The city authorized purchase of a $1.6-million computer-aided dispatch system 
that will enable emergency services to respond to 911 calls within 20 seconds. 
The sophisticated system will place computers in police and fire vehicles and 
eliminate the need for officers to make radio contact with a dispatcher or to 
make hand-written records that have to be transferred into a computer system 
later.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;

<P>
TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS DECREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traffic accidents in Culver City decreased in 1988 by about one-fifth from 1987 
and have dropped 55% since 1980, the Police Department has reported. 
</P>
<P>
There were 548 accidents last year, down from 684 in 1987 and 1,239 in 1980. 
The decrease was largest for noninjury accidents, which dropped to 239 in 1988 
from 365 in 1987. Injury accidents decreased from 319 to 309 in the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic volume has increased and was 50% higher in 1988 than in 1980, according 
to the department. More than 300,000 cars travel through Culver City each day, 
according to the department. 
</P>
<P>
The drop can be attributed to selective enforcement, in which 10 motorcycle 
officers and two investigators are assigned to areas prone to accidents or 
errant drivers, said Lt. Owen Smet of the traffic bureau. He said issuing 
tickets brings about a reduction in accidents because drivers who see someone 
pulled over or who are pulled over themselves tend to drive more safely "just 
out of fear of getting a ticket."

A DOWNTOWN OF A 'CERTAIN MATURITY';

<P>
BEVERLY HILLS CONSIDERS FACE LIFT FOR CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSEANNE KEYNAN, Community Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In some quarters, the image of Beverly Hills is one of preoccupation with good 
looks and money. City Council members focused on both those issues at their 
study session Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Like an aging actor whose chin is sagging, the city is considering a face lift 
for its central business district, which, as Deputy City Manager Robert C. 
Walsh delicately put it, "is of a certain maturity." 
</P>
<P>
A proposed urban design project, originally conceived by landowners and 
businesses, would dress up the triangle bounded by Wilshire and Santa Monica 
boulevards and Crescent Drive, and would also take in a strip of Beverly Drive 
south to Olympic. Landscaping, new granite sidewalks, colorful crosswalks and 
plaza-like areas with outdoor cafes and hanging planter boxes -- all features 
of the proposal -- were illustrated on large easel boards in the council 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$5.5 Million a Year 
</P>
<P>
The improvements would cost up to $5.5 million annually in capital expenditures 
and maintenance for 25 years, Walsh said, and would be financed jointly by the 
city, property owners and merchant tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Rodeo Drive retailer Jerry Magnin, a member of the Urban Design Committee, made 
an impassioned pitch for "the full-blown program." Magnin called Beverly Hills 
"the best shopping area in the whole world" and likened Rodeo Drive to 
fashionable boulevards in Paris, Rome and London. 
</P>
<P>
But those boulevards, unlike Rodeo Drive, he said, had spawned nearby streets 
that were of similar interest to well-heeled shoppers, enhancing the 
attractiveness of the entire area. 
</P>
<P>
"There are fabulous stores in Century City and the Beverly Center that should 
be in Beverly Hills," Magnin said, "but they can't afford Rodeo Drive (rents), 
and there is no secondary street that's nice enough." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning Issued 
</P>
<P>
Citing the decline of the once-fashionable Miracle Mile and Hollywood 
Boulevard, Magnin said Beverly Hills must look to the future to avoid a similar 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating that some property owners and tenants would balk at the high cost 
of the proposed improvements, he said San Jose recently spent $95 per square 
foot of commercial development, and Denver and Portland similar amounts, for 
urban design. 
</P>
<P>
Magnin estimated building costs for the Beverly Hills project at $100 per 
square foot, though each landowner would be assessed according to a complicated 
formula. Some of that cost would be passed along to tenants in the form of rent 
raises. 
</P>
<P>
"Higher rent is the price you pay for success," Magnin said. 
</P>
<P>
The council directed the city staff to notify and meet with landowners and 
merchants by Oct. 27. A public protest hearing is scheduled for Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Looking good isn't the only thing that carries a hefty price tag. Having it all 
costs, too. Turning its attention to cash flow, the council heard City Manager 
Ed Kreins say the general fund would suffer a shortfall unless the city 
restructures $72 million of its current debt, increases revenues or cuts back 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upgraded Facilities 
</P>
<P>
Finance Administrator Donald Oblander reminded the council that, in addition to 
a new Civic Center, Beverly Hills is about to enjoy upgraded library facilities 
and has ordered a new emergency dispatch system. In addition, the city is 
building a larger jail. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members expressed reservations about refinancing the debt but 
instructed the city staff to meet with financial and legal consultants to 
prepare documents for a 30-year refinancing, to be reviewed by the council in 
four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Allan Alexander said refinancing, which must be voted on, will be 
"a major decision." Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds said: "If we go into hock, we 
may have to consider (approving profitable developments such as) hotels and 
large landholdings, which are anathema to some residents." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Max Salter was the only council member who said he definitely will not 
vote for refinancing. "I cannot in conscience pass this debt on to future 
generations," he said.

CLUB TO REOPEN ON CRUISE SHIP IN MARINA DEL REY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heartbreak, a hip nightspot of New York origin that folded earlier this year in 
Hollywood after only three months because of city permit problems, is reopening 
later this month in a new location: a cruise ship docked in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The '50s-style dance club and restaurant hopes to avoid similar permit problems 
by chartering a ship that already has the necessary dance and liquor permits. 
The Spirit of Los Angeles, a three-level, 200-foot long, 1,000-passenger cruise 
ship, has been offering brunch, lunch, dinner and weekend party cruises out of 
the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro since April. The capacity for dinner is 
600. 
</P>
<P>
The ship will move from San Pedro to Marina del Rey's Fisherman's Village on 
Fiji Way on Monday nights, the only night Heartbreak will operate. It will open 
from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. beginning Sept. 25. The ship will remain docked. 
</P>
<P>
There are several boat companies that offer similar dining and party cruises, 
but Heartbreak is believed to be the first permanent nightclub to open on a 
regular basis on a cruise ship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Run Afoul of County 
</P>
<P>
But although the ship has its liquor and dance permits, it may still run afoul 
of the County Department of Beaches and Harbors, which oversees the marina. 
Chris Klinger, deputy director of the department, said he is concerned that 
there may not be sufficient parking at Fisherman's Village for existing 
restaurants and the club, and whether a ship as large as the Spirit of Los 
Angeles can safely dock at a nearby pier. 
</P>
<P>
Klinger said he has had preliminary talks with ship officials, but that final 
approval for docking has not been given. 
</P>
<P>
Publicist Richard Lewis, who is a partner in Heartbreak and represents the 
cruise ship company, said moving the club to Marina del Rey will make it more 
accessible to patrons in the Westside. In addition to celebrities -- Emilio 
Estevez, Justine Bateman, Woody Harrelson and Vanna White were regulars during 
the short life of the Hollywood club -- he said he hopes to attract many of the 
same patrons who dine at chic Westside eateries. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said Monday was selected as the one night to open with the hopes of 
recreating a New York habit of Monday night as the hip night to go out 
clubbing. 
</P>
<P>
"In New York, people who live in Manhattan go out of town for the weekend, and 
people from New Jersey and the surrounding boroughs come into the city for the 
night life," he said. "On Sunday, people who live in Manhattan come back into 
the city, and on Monday night they are ready to go out dancing. We want to make 
Monday the night to go out in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Club owner Lenny Berg said reopening the club on a ship allowed him a quick way 
to get back into business without the delay and hassle of obtaining the 
necessary permits. 
</P>
<P>
"There are also no neighbors," Berg said, alluding to another source of 
problems for many nightspots. 
</P>
<P>
Heartbreak was among a handful of New York offshoots that opened with great 
fanfare earlier this year only to close because of run-ins with city officials 
over permits and complaints from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Heartbreak opened Dec. 27 on North La Brea Avenue and closed in March when 
authorities discovered that it was operating without the proper permits. Berg 
maintains that the former owners of the site had assured him that the necessary 
dance and liquor permits were intact. 
</P>
<P>
The old club had a capacity of 152 and offered a game room and VIP lounge in 
addition to the dance floor and restaurant. The new Heartbreak will offer 
dancing on the main floor of the ship, live entertainment and dining on the 
second floor, and a game room and VIP lounge on the third floor.

Photo, A Reverent Restoration for Chapel Gary Cooper became an honorary Sioux 
there. Rudy Vallee -- by some accounts -- said his wedding vows there. The 
Ramona Chapel, built about 1925, is perhaps the most popular attraction at 
Newhall's Heritage Square, a collection of antique buildings maintained by the 
Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society, which is restoring the tiny wooden 
building. The society began restoring the outside this summer and poured a 
concrete base for the wooden steps last week. The group hopes to complete the 
work by December, said Bob Diem, who is overseeing the work. Fixing the inside, 
which has suffered from years of neglect, will take longer, he said. "It's a 
delightful little building," said Jerry Reynolds, a society member. "I wish it 
were twice as big as it was. It seats about 12 -- if they're friendly." JOE

SANTA MONICA, WLA TO OPEN SATURDAY

Santa Monica College will try to build on last year's promise, and West Los 
Angeles College will try to forget last year when they play their football 
openers Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The SMC Corsairs, 6-5 last year, will be at Chaffey College at 7 p.m., and the 
WLAC Oilers, 0-10 in 1988, will play host to Victor Valley at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs, ranked 18th in the state in preseason by the JC Athletic Bureau, 
played in the first Western State Conference Bowl last season, losing to No. 9 
Glendale, 23-20. WLAC returned to football last season after a two-year hiatus 
because of budget cuts, and Coach Dick Jones had to try and rebuild the program 
after he was hired in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Corsairs, who finished second to national champion Bakersfield in 
the Western State Conference South Division last season, have only a couple of 
returning starters, Coach Ralph Vidal, said that the team's apparent 
inexperience is "kind of deceptive." 
</P>
<P>
"We have some talented, strong players who played behind good people last 
year," Vidal said. "Plus, we have some key transfers who started at other 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
All-state tackle Eduardo Vegas (6-6 1/2, 322), the former Hamilton High star, 
leads the offensive line, and Vidal said that Randy Cole (6-2, 224) "could 
become the finest linebacker" in the school's history. Either former Venice 
High star Ernie Soto, who sat out last year with a leg injury, or Jeff Barrett, 
a Nevada Reno transfer, will start at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
WLAC's Jones said his team "will be more competitive. We have better quality 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
Among returning Oilers are wide receiver Stanley Howell, linebacker Craig 
Bowens, offensive guard David Hodge and free safety Kevin Bowers. The 
quarterback will be former Crenshaw High player Kevin McNeal, who served in the 
armed forces the last two years.

3-YEAR-OLD SUFFERS ONLY FRACTURES IN 4-STORY PLUNGE TO PAVEMENT

Delfina Martinez panicked when she looked out the open window of her Santa Ana 
apartment and saw her 3-year-old son, who had been playing in the living room 
moments earlier, sprawled on the pavement four stories below. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old single parent sprinted down the stairs, sure that when she 
reached Jose's motionless body, he would be dead. But as she cradled him in her 
arms, the boy started to stir and soon began crying and rubbing the bruises on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
In what doctors Wednesday were calling an amazing bit of luck -- and what his 
mother has proclaimed a "miracle of God" -- Jose Torres Martinez not only 
survived the 40-foot fall the day before but appears to have sustained no 
permanent damage despite landing head-first on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Jose was listed in critical but improving condition Wednesday at United Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana. A brain scan revealed no neurological damage, 
hospital spokeswoman Sue Delaney said, adding that the boy's injuries are 
limited to multiple facial fractures. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very, very lucky," said Dr. Michael Ponaman, a physician who treated the 
boy in the medical center's pediatrics intensive-care unit. "I think the child 
will do well. I think the outcome will be a relatively happy one for the 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Ponaman, who has treated other young victims of falls, said the same fall 
likely would have killed or incapacitated an adult. Adults' bones are more 
rigid and, consequently, prone to more serious injury in falls. 
</P>
<P>
Ponaman said that children also tend to suffer less neurological damage from a 
fall because their brains are more "plastic" than an adult's, and able to 
absorb more shock. If one part of a child's brain is damaged, Ponaman 
explained, other areas are often able to compensate for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney said that the medical center's doctors have treated numerous cases of 
children who have fallen, but "not (one) from four stories." 
</P>
<P>
Said Martinez: "It is a miracle of God that my boy is not dead." 
</P>
<P>
She said she had left Jose and his 1 1/2-year-old sister, Lorena, alone in the 
living room of her one-bedroom apartment -- which she had just rented but not 
occupied -- for just a moment Tuesday afternoon to use the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned, she found Lorena alone in the room and a window that was 
less than two feet above the floor open. The boy had apparently climbed onto 
the windowsill and fallen out, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see him anywhere," she said. "I happened to look out the window and I 
saw him laying down there. Then I ran outside." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez and her mother, Juliamenta Martinez, 52, rode with Jose in the 
ambulance. All that night, as doctors worked feverishly on the boy in the 
emergency room, Delfina Martinez said that she and her mother prayed and 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
The two women, joined later by other members of the family, maintained a vigil 
at the hospital until 10:30 p.m., when they left for the night. Delfina 
Martinez said she was unable to sleep much, though, and hurried back to the 
hospital the first thing Wednesday morning. A devoutly religious woman who says 
she faithfully attends Mass, she prayed that the news from the doctor Wednesday 
would be good. 
</P>
<P>
It was. 
</P>
<P>
"I thank God for saving my child," said Martinez as she embraced her infant 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police officials Wednesday theorized that the boy climbed onto the 
sill and fell out through a loosly attached window screen, which fell to the 
ground along with the boy. 
</P>
<P>
A representative from the Orange County Department of Social Services also 
investigated and was on hand Wendesday to help interpret for Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said she has no job and very little money and has to sleep on the 
floor with her children. She said that in 1981, she emigrated from the Mexican 
state of Guerrero to the California farming town of Salinas -- to follow her 
mother and some other relatives -- where she made about $200 a week cleaning 
house and baby-sitting. 
</P>
<P>
She arrived in Santa Ana a week ago to again live with relatives and had just 
rented the one-bedroom apartment in the 600 block of North Garfield Street for 
herself, her parents and her two children. The $625-per-month apartment is on 
the top floor of a pinkish-stucco complex, which is marred by graffiti-strewn 
corridors and stairways. 
</P>
<P>
Out of work because of what she describes as heavy competition in the job 
market, Martinez said her only certainty is that she will not be staying in the 
apartment where the accident occurred. She said she is arranging with her 
landlord to move into another apartment -- on the ground floor.

PANEL BURIES BILL TO ALLOW VOTE ON SALES TAX HIKE FOR JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An Assembly subcommittee on Wednesday blocked a bill that would allow Orange 
County residents to vote on a proposed half-cent sales tax increase for a new 
jail and court facilities, prompting an outcry from local officials who had 
counted on the measure's passage by next week's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The troubled bill, sponsored by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), 
already has dodged a number of deadly legislative bullets and was thought to be 
headed for final approval before lawmakers adjourn for the year on Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, members of an Assembly Ways and Means subcommittee 
unexpectedly ambushed the bill and decided to keep it bottled up indefinitely, 
contending that the measure was flawed. Committee chairman Mike Roos (D-Los 
Angeles) and others said Wednesday that the measure appeared to be an effort to 
circumvent Proposition 13, which specifically requires a two-thirds vote to 
impose any new taxes. The Bergeson measure, that had been expected to go before 
voters in June, 1990, would require only a majority vote to impose the added 
half-cent tax. 
</P>
<P>
There appeared to be some effort late Wednesday to revive the measure by 
amending it to a similar bill in the state Senate. But the committee's action, 
nonetheless, caught Bergeson and Orange County officials by surprise and raised 
doubts about their ability to find the $121 million in seed money needed to 
build a $700-million jail in Gypsum Canyon, east of Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to give you some flip answer like 'It's back to the drawing 
board,' but I'm too shocked," said Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. 
Riley in Orange County, moments after he learned of the action in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to find a new jail somewhere and finance it someway, and we all 
accepted the fact that this was practically a done deal," Riley said. "We're 
trying to react now to what has happened. I know we're going to have to come up 
with some funding mechanism if this doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all hoping that a miracle can happen up there and something would come 
forward," Riley said, adding that being forced to find another way to pay for 
the jail would "open up pretty emotional issues" on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates has said that the measure is desperately needed 
because cramped jail space forces him to turn away or prematurely release more 
than 50,000 criminals a year. The proposed tax hike, he argues, would cost the 
average Orange County family $50 to $75 a year, and much of the money would 
come from tourists flocking to Disneyland and other local points of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said Wednesday that he was "frustrated" by the subcommittee's action and 
stressed that the sales tax money was needed not only for jail space but for a 
new juvenile hall and added courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating and hard for me to understand why they would not want to let 
it out and let our voters have a chance to say yes or no," Gates said in a 
telephone interview. "I don't really see a risk to anybody else if that bill 
comes out. It goes to our voters . . . and we really don't impact anybody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Asked after the hearing what the subcommittee's action means, Bergeson replied: 
"It means that there's no jail." 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite the apparent finality of the committee's actions on Wednesday, word 
began circulating by late afternoon that Bergeson was working on a deal to take 
her jail tax bill out of the Assembly for now and have it amended to a similar 
measure winding its way through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County lobbyist Dennis E. Carpenter, a former state senator from Newport 
Beach, said late Wednesday that there is still hope for the jail-tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead? Heck no," Carpenter said when asked if the measure was lost. 
</P>
<P>
Yet any effort to revive the measure in the Senate would still have to be 
approved by the Assembly. And chances are, legislative aides indicated, that 
any reconstituted Orange County measure would be sent directly back to the 
hostile Ways and Means subcommittee for more of the same treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Roos predicted after Wednesday's hearing that the Bergeson measure would 
languish for the remainder of the session, which ends in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, would foil plans by Bergeson and Orange County officials to have 
Gov. George Deukmejian sign the measure into law in time to put the sales-tax 
increase on the June, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that . . . there is a high probability that you won't see any 
action until January," Roos said.

AUDIT SAYS GATES' USE OF $335,061 ON BUSH VISIT WAS LEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A county auditor's report released Wednesday says that Sheriff Brad Gates spent 
$335,061 from his drug-fighting budget to pay for President Bush's Orange 
County visit last April and that because the event was considered an 
"emergency" it did not require approval from the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The report says the speedy and extensive work needed to prepare the remote 
canyon site called Rancho del Rio "required some creativity and bending of the 
rules at various times." But it concludes that no state or county laws were 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
"No one involved initially realized the actual extent of the work necessary to 
prepare for the president and the ultimate costs that would be involved," 
Auditor-Controller Steven E. Lewis wrote in the report. "If management would 
have known the final cost figures, they probably would have acted differently 
and would have required more approvals and closer adherence to established 
procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Gates said the White House selected Rancho del Rio as a site for Bush's visit 
because the 213-acre property was seized by authorities during a drug 
investigation. But turning the backwoods ranch near Ronald W. Caspers 
Wilderness Park into a one-time-only staging area for the president and 1,400 
invited guests required extensive work on a 3.5-mile dirt road as well as the 
addition of telephone lines, electricity, toilets and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the $335,061 he calculated does not include several thousand dollars 
in labor and equipment that was donated to the effort, including more than a 
dozen buses and drivers from the Marine Corps to transport guests. 
</P>
<P>
All of the money was confiscated by the Sheriff's Department during drug 
investigations. A 1984 federal law allows local law enforcement agencies to 
keep money they seize in narcotics investigations as long as it is spent to 
fight drugs. The U.S Department of Justice determined that Bush's anti-drug 
speech was a proper use of the money. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said that the supervisors should have been asked to vote on the expense 
but that the lack of a vote did not violate proper procedures. Chief Assistant 
County Counsel Bill McCourt also said that the sheriff did not break any rules 
but that "if somebody sued us, then we'd go back and get it ratified" 
retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
The report did not resolve one of the central questions surrounding the cost of 
the President's visit -- whether Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley approved 
the plan. Gates has insisted that Riley endorsed the project, while Riley 
repeated Wednesday that he was never asked for his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who was unavailable for comment Wednesday, has said that he didn't talk 
to any other supervisors and that he assumed they would be notified about the 
work by Riley. But none of the supervisors said they were aware of the extent 
of work being done at the site, and several said they were surprised when they 
saw the total cost. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us would have swallowed several times if we knew (the cost) of 
what was happening," Riley said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Riley disputed a phrase in the auditor's report that said "the chairman of the 
Board of Supervisors endorsed the concept of the visit." He also questioned a 
sentence that said, "We believe the board has granted a waiver of normal 
internal procedures for work done in preparation of the president's visit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to Avoid Problem 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he will propose a county ordinance to avoid such problems in the 
future. He said the ordinance would implement a recommendation in the report 
that would require county agencies to describe the size of such projects to the 
supervisors and the County Administrative Office "prior to getting a formal or 
informal commitment to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, top management of involved departments should be instructed to 
consult county counsel and reach agreement as to whether a true emergency 
exists," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Under such an emergency, state law allows counties to ignore such rules as the 
requirement that purchases or labor be put out to bid. 
</P>
<P>
The law defines an emergency as a "sudden, generally unexpected occurrence" 
that requires immediate action to prevent the loss of essential services or 
finances. County Counsel McCourt said, however, that court interpretations have 
expanded the definition to "cover any circumstance where it's just not 
practical to go to bid." 
</P>
<P>
"As a practical matter," McCourt said, "this may not be an emergency. But what 
are you going to do? Say to the President, 'You can't come because we have to 
go to bid'?" 
</P>
<P>
The most significant work required to prepare Rancho del Rio was on the dirt 
road stretching to the site from Ortega Highway. The road, which was in such 
bad shape that it was impassable at places, required extensive grading and the 
addition of several tons of gravel so that Orange County Transit District buses 
could use it. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, county rules might have required the board to approve that work. But 
Lewis' report said the board approval could be waived if the work was 
considered maintenance rather than construction.

RETIREES AND COUNCIL MEMBERS TO GOLF FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Free use of Costa Mesa's golf course was granted to retired city workers and 
former and current City Council members by the council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Retired employees must have served the city for at least 20 years to be 
eligible for golf passes, which waive green fees at the Costa Mesa Golf and 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Orville Amburgey said the passes were a way to recognize workers 
with long service to the city. 
</P>
<P>
For several years the city has informally allowed former and current City 
Council members to play without charge. Their inclusion in this new policy 
formalizes that practice.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FULLERTON;

<P>
FOX THEATRE TO REOPEN AFTER MAJOR RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The curtain is scheduled to rise again at Fullerton's historic Fox Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
After a million-dollar renovation, the 1925-vintage theater will reopen as a 
three-screen cinema showing classics and foreign films, as well as first-run 
movies, the new operator told the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox, on Harbor Boulevard near Chapman Avenue, closed two years ago in a 
state of disrepair. The council has urged owner Edward Lewis to renovate the 
theater, considered one of Fullerton's landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he signed a 20-year operating agreement with Los Angeles-based 
Landmark Theatre Corp. under which the company will restore the theater and he 
will restore the rest of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the renovations will preserve the cultural history of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark operates two other theaters in Orange County, the Balboa Cinema in 
Newport Beach and the Port Theatre in Corona del Mar, as well as about 40 
others in nine states. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox is "an ideal site for our Orange County flagship," said Landmark 
President Steve Gilula. 
</P>
<P>
The theater should be able to attract 137,000 moviegoers during its first year, 
he said. The company hopes to reopen the theater in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Fullerton has tentatively agreed to help the theater by building an 
adjacent, 200-space parking structure. Buying the land and building the 
structure will cost about $4 million, according to Hugh Berry, director of 
community development.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEWPORT BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
DAMAGE AWARD VOIDED IN BLOOD-TEST CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Beach police acted reasonably in allegedly grabbing a drunk-driving 
suspect and holding him so a nurse could draw his blood, a federal appeals 
court ruled Wednesday in overturning a $15,500 damage award. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco reversed a federal court 
jury's decision that the officers had violated the constitutional rights of 
Timothy Hammer during a blood test after his arrest in June, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'force' used . . . was nothing more than the application of physical 
restraint required to conduct the blood extraction in a safe and efficient 
manner," Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall held in the 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer's lawyer, Stephen Yagman, said the court had usurped the jury's role and 
"decided to retry the case." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer was stopped for speeding by Officer Armando Zatarain and failed roadside 
sobriety tests, the court said. Hammer refused to take a blood, breath or urine 
test to determine his blood-alcohol level. At a Newport Beach hospital, Hammer 
said Zatarain grabbed him and handcuffed him to a chair while a nurse swabbed 
his arm. When he flinched from the needle, he said that both he and the officer 
fell to the floor. He added that Zatarain held him down in the chair while the 
blood was taken. Hammer later pleaded no contest to drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
The officer denied touching Hammer. But a jury found that Hammer's rights had 
been violated and awarded $4,000 in compensation, $1,500 in punitive damages 
against Zatarain, and $10,000 in punitive damages against Charles Gross, who 
was Newport Beach police chief at the time of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruled that the judge should have thrown the damages out 
because Zatarain did not use unreasonable force.

PAINTER OF SWASTIKAS AT SCHOOL SERVES 45 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old Garden Grove man who painted swastikas on a blackboard in a 
Costa Mesa elementary school in June pleaded guilty to three charges and has 
served 45 days in jail, the prosecutor of the case said. 
</P>
<P>
Daryl Gregory Smith was arrested for a vandalism rampage in June after children 
in a second-grade classroom at California Elementary School discovered Polaroid 
pictures that the suspect had taken of himself and left in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Smith held a camera at arm's length and took pictures of his face 
and the top of his head, with the classroom bulletin board in the background. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of arrest, police said Smith wore a black T-shirt, blue jeans and 
military boots and had a crew cut -- characteristics of a "skinhead." 
</P>
<P>
But police and Smith was not a skinhead. He merely spent time with them. 
</P>
<P>
"He may hang out with skinheads, but he does not preach white supremacy," said 
Costa Mesa Detective Bob Fate. "He was just goofing around." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Diane Archer, said the case was not 
considered a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
"The police knew him," Archer said. "They didn't see him as a threat. It was an 
isolated incident." 
</P>
<P>
Smith took $40 in change and ate food from an earthquake preparedness kit in 
the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
School janitors cleaned up the vandalism before students or teachers could see 
it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith pleaded guilty to mischief, petty theft and resisting arrest after he 
tried to flee from arresting officers. Two other charges, breaking and entering 
and possession of marijuana, were later dropped, Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, placed on three years' probation, was ordered to pay for clean-up costs, 
she said. Neither Smith nor his attorney, Catherine Lugo-Rinaldi, deputy public 
defender, would talk about the case.

</P>
<P>
SCAFFOLDING COLLAPSES, LEAVING 2 MEN INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A four-story network of steel scaffolding collapsed Wednesday beside a nearly 
completed hotel in Garden Grove, injuring two workers and damaging more than $1 
million in new cars at a dealership next door. 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Torres Alvarado, 17, and Rudolpho Aguilar, 20, tumbled from the third 
floor of the scaffolding as it buckled beneath them but escaped critical 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were in stable condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange. "They're 
doing fine," said Marie Sanders, the hospital's clinical coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Lukas, a Garden Grove fire inspector, said several other workers on the 
scaffolding managed to scramble back into the unfinished building, a Ramada at 
10080 Garden Grove Blvd. The crews were finishing stucco work on a wall when 
the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were unsure what caused the 450-foot-long skeleton of steel to 
collapse shortly after 3:30 p.m. Investigators from Cal/OSHA were supposed to 
arrive on the scene today to pick through the tangled wreckage for clues, Lukas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The tumbling steel virtually buried 30 or 40 new Jeep Cherokees -- each valued 
at about $28,000 -- in a lot at the adjacent County Wide Chrysler-Jeep-Eagle 
dealership, said Victor Sietsema, sales manager. The tires of several of the 
vehicles were flattened by the force of the impact.

WOMAN, 80, KILLED AS CAR RAMS INTO FLOWER SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An elderly woman was killed and another seriously injured Wednesday when their 
car allegedly ran a red light and plowed through a La Habra intersection, 
ramming two cars before smashing through the front of a flower shop. 
</P>
<P>
Ilma Caple, 80, of El Monte died of massive internal injuries, while the 
driver, Nannie Herford, 81, of Duarte, suffered internal injuries and was 
hospitalized in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers of the other cars, Mireya Ortega, 26, of La Habra and Marie Garcia, 
41, of Brea were not injured in the 9:25 a.m. accident, La Habra Police Sgt. 
Phil Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that Herford was southbound on Beach Boulevard when she 
went through a red light at the La Habra Boulevard intersection, Stufflebean 
said. Her Chevrolet Chevette hit the other two cars, and the accelerator 
apparently stuck, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The car jumped a curb, sped across a parking lot and bashed through the 
storefront, coming to rest inside, Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
No one inside the flower shop was injured. But the building, nestled inside a 
small commercial center, was deemed uninhabitable by authorities because of 
extensive damage, Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
A medical helicopter took Caple to UCI Medical Center in Orange, but she died 
shortly after arrival, Stufflebean said. Herford was taken to Friendly Hills 
Regional Medical Center in La Habra, where a spokeswoman said she was treated 
in the emergency room before being admitted.

HUNTINGTON BEACH OKS PUBLIC GOLF COURSE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH WILLIAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite strong objections from equestrians, runners and environmentalists, 
Huntington Beach is moving forward with plans to build an 18-hole public golf 
course on an undeveloped tract of land in the city's sprawling Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the golf course, to be built and operated under a 40-year 
contract with the American Golf Corp., is tentatively scheduled to begin next 
June. The target date for opening is January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach City Council approved the golf course plan by a 5-2 vote 
after a heated public hearing Tuesday night attended by about 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report by an ad hoc committee set up to study the proposal, the 
course will bring in a minimum of $200,000 a year to city coffers over the 
first five years, and annual revenue should jump to more than $500,000 after 20 
years. The committee said the golf course will attractively develop an area 
that is "currently an eyesore." 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, however, more than 30 residents spoke out against the proposal 
in a 3 1/2-hour debate focusing on its environmental and aesthetic 
ramifications on Central Park, a 380-acre tract on both sides of Golden West 
Street at Talbert Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Some speakers expressed fear that the golf course would further encroach on the 
park's shrinking open space and force out joggers, horseback riders, mountain 
bike enthusiasts and school cross-country teams in favor of golfers. Opponents 
said golfers account for only 8% of the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
Others warned that fertilizers and pesticides used to maintain the course would 
leach through the soil and contaminate ground-water supplies and nearby Lake 
Huntington. Some questioned whether the area's diminishing water supply could 
even meet the maintenance demands of more than 90 acres of fairways and greens. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Wes Bannister, however, replied that even if the city does not build the 
golf course it is still liable to maintain and clean up the area, which would 
require the use of city water and cost taxpayers an estimated $5 million to 
remove contaminated soil, abandoned oil derricks and garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bannister said that even with the golf course the city would still 
possess more than 1,800 acres of open space in the form of wetlands and parks, 
plus nine miles of public beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Some speakers demanded that the city honor three city surveys that they claim 
overwhelmingly show public opposition to the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister countered that the surveys were either dated, incomplete or poorly 
worded and entirely unrelated to the golf course. He also noted that even 
though the surveys made no mention about a possible public golf course, many of 
the respondents wrote in that they would like to see the city build one. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 people spoke in favor of the proposal, saying that the only other such 
public facility, Meadowlark Golf Course, is so overcrowded that on busy days a 
four-hour wait is not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was passed with amendments requiring golf course revenues to be 
used to repay any related city costs and fund future park acquisitions. The 
council also amended the proposal to include civic associations and interest 
groups in future negotiations regarding the course. 
</P>
<P>
Voting to move ahead with the golf course were Bannister and council members 
John Erskine, Don MacAllister, Tom Mays and Jim Silva. Casting dissenting votes 
were council members Grace Winchell and Peter M. Green.

SUPPLIER SAYS SAN CLEMENTE MUST CONSIDER RATIONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Clemente's water supplier, which earlier this summer faced severe 
shortfalls, criticized the City Council on Wednesday for deferring action on 
proposed water rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Board members of the Tri-Cities Municipal Water District, at their meeting 
Wednesday, said the City Council had been shortsighted in its Aug. 30 decision 
to put off a rationing proposal. The council concluded that an emergency no 
longer existed. 
</P>
<P>
The water board voted to send the City Council a letter urging it to "act upon 
an emergency water conservation ordinance at the earliest opportunity in order 
to ensure there will be sufficient water during peak demand periods." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Woodside, general manager for Tri-Cities, told the board meeting: "We're in 
pretty good shape now, but September and October are known for some hot Santa 
Ana winds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indian Summer Use May Rise 
</P>
<P>
Woodside said he worries about increased water use in that period. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action Wednesday, the water board voted to consider an allocation 
system of its supplies. Under such a plan, San Clemente would get a set 
percentage of available water. San Clemente uses about 66% of Tri-Cities' total 
water supply, according to water officials. Tri-Cities now has no ceiling for 
users. 
</P>
<P>
The water board said it would discuss a possible allocation system at its 
meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Cities is a water wholesaler that also delivers to Capistrano Beach, which 
is now a part of newly incorporated Dana Point, and to San Onofre State Park 
and San Onofre Nuclear Power Generating Station, both in northern San Diego 
County. Its five-person board of directors is independently elected. 
</P>
<P>
A water shortfall in Tri-Cities' reservoir occurred in July and August because 
more water was being used than the district could pump back in, the water 
officials said. The shortfall began easing in mid-August after San Clemente 
Mayor Brian J. Rice and other city officials began urging voluntary water 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said Aug. 30 that it would be "a slap in the face" of city residents who 
voluntarily conserved during the water emergency for the City Council to enact 
mandatory rationing. The City Council unanimously agreed. 
</P>
<P>
But Dennis A. Erdman, president of the Tri-Cities board, noted Wednesday that 
the proposed ordinance would have gone into effect only if reservoir water 
levels again dropped severely. Erdman said the city should have passed the law 
Aug. 30 so it could act quickly in case of another water emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"As the 'wholesale supplier' of water to this area, we (Tri-Cities) can only 
encourage conservation to get through these shortfall periods," Erdman said. 
"The city, however, has the authority to impose conservation measures which are 
designed to limit consumption." 
</P>
<P>
Former San Clemente mayor Karoline Koester attended the water board meeting and 
told the panel that she supports both a water allocation system by Tri-Cities 
and an emergency water-rationing law by the city. She said both are needed 
because growth in San Clemente is outstripping the city's ability to provide 
such basic services as water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth Controls Urged 
</P>
<P>
A frequent critic of "uncontrolled growth," Koester said more and more homes 
are being built in San Clemente, even as the water supply dwindles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're coming to a turn in the road, gentlemen, we really are," Koester said. 
"Water has finite limits. I think we're in an ongoing emergency because we're 
using more water than the pipeline can supply. 
</P>
<P>
"That was obvious during the crisis. . . . I think it is only fair to the users 
to tell them how much water they can expect by having an allocation system. 
We're really going to have to look in earnestness now about growth control."

INQUIRY CLEARS HOSPITALS' ACTION ON CRASH VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
University of California investigators have exonerated medical centers at UC 
Irvine, UCLA and UC San Diego for refusing to admit a fatally injured 
Westminster man who lacked health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Juan Jimenez Collado, who suffered massive injuries in a Memorial 
Day weekend traffic accident, say he would have lived if he had been been 
transferred from Pioneers Memorial Hospital in Brawley to a better-equipped 
facility in Orange, San Diego or Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
They also say the 43-year-old ex-boxer was denied admission to nine urban 
hospitals -- including the UC facilities -- because he was a Medi-Cal patient. 
</P>
<P>
But in a letter released Wednesday, UC Vice President Cornelius L. Hopper said 
Jimenez could not be transferred to a UC hospital because the hospitals were 
full and because staff at Pioneers Memorial initiated the transfer request 
incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Hopper wrote, no physician at Pioneers was available to request 
the transfer. On another occasion, on June 3, Pioneers' staff members asked to 
transfer Jimenez to UCSD Medical Center but then changed their minds, saying 
that "a transfer was no longer being requested." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Hopper noted, although two beds came open June 8 in UCI Medical Center's 
surgical intensive care unit, "they were committed to patients already 
undergoing scheduled surgery and were filled by these patients by 3 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez died at Pioneers on June 18 after suffering multiple fractures, shock, 
kidney failure and gangrene. 
</P>
<P>
Hopper's Aug. 3 letter was released Wednesday by Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-San 
Diego) who had worked to get Jimenez transferred and then, disturbed by the 
circumstances surrounding his death, had asked UC, state licensing and Medi-Cal 
officials to conduct separate investigations of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services concluded Aug. 14 that Jimenez was too 
sick and unstable to be moved and that the nine hospitals did nothing wrong.

CORONA DEL MAR HIRES TENNIS COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Salazar said Wednesday he has been hired to coach boys' and girls' tennis 
at Corona del Mar High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in gearing myself to coach on the college level," Salazar said. 
"Obviously, this is one of the top programs around. It's the closest thing 
there is to a college program in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Salazar replaces Dave Heffern, who resigned in August to become a private coach 
for Mike Briggs, a former Corona del Mar and UC Irvine player. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar, who played tennis at the University of Northern Colorado, was coach at 
Edison last season.

ESPERANZA LIMPS INTO OPENER; 
</P>
<P>
INJURIES TO KEY PLAYERS DIM HOPES OF GOOD SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County high school football season kicks off tonight with a match-up 
of contenders-to-be in Division III -- Santa Ana and Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the game comes at a time when Esperanza is weakened because of 
injuries to key players. 
</P>
<P>
Starting fullback Mark Parlin, a junior, turned his ankle on the first day the 
players practiced in pads and sophomore Garrick Emry (6-feet-9, 195 pounds) 
will start in his place. Senior safety/ wide receiver Greg Hauser, an 
all-Empire League selection as a junior, tore cartilage in his left knee in 
two-a-day drills two weeks ago and will be out three to four weeks recovering 
from surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"That puts a dent in the passing game. That hurts us a little bit," Coach Gary 
Meek said. "We are coming off a season we were pretty disappointed in. Our 
offense just didn't evolve very well. We had a young quarterback and we just 
didn't put points on the board." 
</P>
<P>
It's best to be at full strength against a team such as Santa Ana. The Saints, 
ranked fourth in the Southern Section preseason poll, are seeking their fourth 
consecutive Century League championship under Coach Dick Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints also have the county's best defensive lineman and possibly the best 
player period in senior Oscar Wilson (6-3, 235), who also will play tight end. 
</P>
<P>
Senior tailback Garner Hicks, though he shared his time in the backfield, 
rushed for 705 yards and six touchdowns, averaging about six yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Tuioti, an all-league selection at linebacker, started the first seven 
games at quarterback last year. He is moving to fullback to make way for Jesse 
Rosas, who stepped in when Tuioti was injured against El Modena. Rosas went on 
to throw for 489 yards and four touchdowns in his next four starts. 
</P>
<P>
With Rosas at quarterback, the Saints might trade their predictable running 
game for some passing fancy. 
</P>
<P>
But Esperanza Coach Gary Meek still believes stopping the Saints' ground game 
is key. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to be able to contain them on the perimeters," said Meek, whose 
Aztecs are ranked ninth and missed the playoffs last season for the first time 
in 13 years. "You can't let Hicks get outside on you. He is probably one of the 
better backs we will face all year. You can't let them get outside and break 
the big one." 
</P>
<P>
Meek does not put much stock in his team's preseason ranking. "Preseason 
rankings are just preseason rankings," he said. "Nobody has played anybody . . 
. there are going to be a lot of mistakes and a lot of things that go wrong, 
and you just have to hope you do a few things right. I want us to be able to 
play well. That's what I'm looking for out of my team." 
</P>
<P>
One of the players Meek is counting on is quarterback Keith McDonald, who 
started last season as a sophomore and has improved over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"He has always had a strong arm, but he has refined his touch and is much more 
of a leader this year than he was last year in regards to running the team," 
Meek said. McDonald has solid receivers in Jerod Smith, Reid Tullen and the 
injured Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, McDonald completed 47 of 124 passes for 606 yards and three 
touchdowns. He also threw 12 interceptions -- another key to tonight's game. 
The Saints intercepted 18 passes last year. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza is no slouch on defense, however. The very big, very physical and 
very mobile Keith Navidi (6-6, 260) returns for his senior season at tackle. He 
was one of the reasons the Aztecs held seven opponents to fewer than 14 points 
last season. He had 10 sacks, 15 tackles for losses, 39 lead tackles, 55 
assists, four deflections and two fumble recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a healthier Esperanza would make for a more competitive game, but with 
the Aztecs' injuries, Santa Ana should win easily. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's other games: 
</P>
<P>
CANYON at CORONA -- Canyon is in the midst of a 17-game winless streak, and the 
Comanches will have a rough time against Corona -- a contender in Division V. 
Corona was 1-29 from 1985-87 and hadn't had a winning season since 1976. All 
that changed last year when Coach David Perkins took the team to the division 
semifinals. Thirteen starters return from that team. Sophomore Steve Bernier is 
the quarterback and kicker Jeff McDaniel will give them an edge. Junior Terry 
Keten rushed for more than 800 yards in 10 games, and offensive tackle Isaac 
McCorkell is a key, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Comanches have their third new coach, Loren Shumer, in as many years. Chuck 
Nickerson will be at quarterback. If he can get protection, Nickerson has a 
good target in wide receiver Marcus Mitchell. Jason Rogers (5-11, 200), a 
transfer from Servite, is the running back. 
</P>
<P>
EL DORADO vs. EL TORO at Mission Viejo -- El Dorado's first-year coach, Rick 
Jones, has only four experienced players returning. El Toro has nine returning 
starters, including quarterback Steve Stenstrom, the best in the South Coast 
League. Stenstrom completed 115 of 205 passes for 1,744 yards and 14 
touchdowns. If that's not enough to make El Toro the favorite, consider this: 
The Chargers have qualified for the playoffs the past 10 seasons under Coach 
Bob Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado will have to contend with tight end Bo Haley, a three-year starter, 
as well as a stable of running backs. The Chargers' defense is suspect, but El 
Dorado may not have the personnel to test it. Moving up from the sophomore team 
is junior quarterback Travis Thompson. Linebacker/running back Brian Wolf and 
tight end/linebacker Brian Hayes also are key players. 
</P>
<P>
LOARA at WESTERN -- One of the more even matchups. Loara tied for fourth place 
in the Empire League last season while Western grabbed the third playoff spot 
in the Orange League. Western has the edge in experience with 10 returning 
starters, but the Pioneers will have to stop a healthy Coy Collins. Collins, a 
senior, rushed for 799 yards in eight games as a sophomore, but was hampered by 
an ankle injury last year. MARINA vs. LOS ALAMITOS at Gahr -- It's the top 
against the bottom in this game. Los Alamitos is the top-ranked team in The 
Times' preseason poll and second-ranked in the Southern Section preseason poll. 
Marina has Orange County's longest losing streak -- 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin quarterback Todd Gragnano is back. He threw for more than 2,000 yards 
in each of the past two seasons and led his team to the Division finals both 
years. And the fastest running back in the county, Erik Mitchell, transferred 
from Mayfair. 
</P>
<P>
John Seeley, Marina's new coach, says the Vikings will be more competitive, but 
don't look for it to happen in this game. 
</P>
<P>
GARDEN GROVE vs. SAVANNA at Glover Stadium -- Garden Grove lost key starters -- 
quarterback, tailback, fullback and the entire offensive line -- from a team 
that went 0-10 last year. Maybe those absent players shouldn't be considered 
losses. Running back Alex Ripley is one to watch. Junior quarterback Bob Ioja 
will have his eyes on wide receiver Joe Squyres. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna has won only six games in the past five seasons. The Rebels' lone 
victory last season was at Garden Grove's expense, so count on some intensity 
in this game. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna gets the edge because of experience. Quarterback Carlos Robledo and 
solid running back -- senior Kenison PoChing return. The Rebels have a new 
coach, former Valencia assistant Fred DiPalma.

ALL EYES ARE ON SANTA MARGARITA, BUT TEAM FOCUSES ON FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1989 football season should offer plenty of interest for fans of Orange 
County small schools. That is if Santa Margarita, a member of the Olympic 
League, doesn't steal the spotlight completely. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita, entering its first varsity season after playing a freelance 
schedule since opening two years ago, is being watched very carefully -- 
whether it likes it or not. 
</P>
<P>
The school, a $26 million, 40-acre production in the hills of eastern Orange 
County, has become an on-going controversy. Santa Margarita can draw 
student-athletes from around the county, and projects its enrollment, now about 
900, to reach 2,000 in a few years -- much to the chagrin of most public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
And Olympic League schools, which have an average enrollment of about 450 each, 
bristle at the thought of Santa Margarita becoming a permanent fixture in their 
league. 
</P>
<P>
But until the matter is resolved, Santa Margarita Coach Jim Hartigan said the 
Eagles will concentrate on football. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't worried about it much," Hartigan said. "When they make the decision 
(about which league Santa Margarita goes to next year), we'll worry about it. 
We're just excited to be in a league and we feel very happy that the Olympic 
League will have us for now." 
</P>
<P>
While Santa Margarita lies low, Whitter Christian, the second-ranked team in 
the Southern Section Division IV, appears to be one of the top contenders for 
the league title, along with defending-champion Valley Christian of Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian has 24 lettermen returning, including 14 starters. Ron 
Papazian, a 6-foot-2, 220-pound fullback/linebacker, is one to watch. Last 
year, he gained 1,051 yards, averaging 6.4 yards a carry, and was the county's 
third-highest scorer with 22 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran lost to graduation its best athlete in quarterback/defensive 
back Jason Neben -- second last year to Servite's Derek Brown in rushing with 
1,489 yards. Senior running back Gil Greene (846 yards, 13 touchdowns as a 
junior) will try to pick up the slack for the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
In the Arrowhead League, Southern California Christian hopes to capitalize with 
its experienced offensive and defensive lines, while Capistrano Valley 
Christian, with only three starters returning, figures to be rebuilding in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
A closer look at the teams: 
</P>
<P>
CAPISTRANO VALLEY CHRISTIAN -- After a 1-9 season in 1988, it might pain 
Capistrano Valley Christian fans to hear that the Eagles are in a rebuilding 
year. But Coach Bob Denson says that's the case with only four lettermen 
returning. 
</P>
<P>
Receiver Jason Rodarmel, one of the county's best, is the bright spot of the 
team. Last year, Rodarmel, an all-Southern Section Division IX first-team pick, 
led the county in receptions with 66 for 846 yards and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Another contributor for Capistrano will be Eagle quarterback Aaron Martin. 
Although Martin started only four games in place of the injured Bret Biegert 
last year, he was mainly used as a running back. Biegert's younger brother, 
junior running back Brian, is the team's only other returning starter. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Biniasz, a 6-4 190 tight end, returns after missing 1988 with a back 
injury, and Darren Crail, a 5-9 140 running back/linebacker, is, according to 
Denson, the other bright spot on the team. 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE LUTHERAN -- Losing Neben, a three-sport athlete, would hurt any team. 
Along with his 1,489 yards gathered in the Lancers' option, Neben, who attends 
Cal State Fullerton but does not compete in any sports, had five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, who ran a 4.6 in the 40, is the team's focal point this year, says 
Lancer Coach Bob Dowding. Aside from Greene, Orange Lutheran has 12 other 
starters returning, including Rodger Pagani, who will move from tackle to 
fullback/linebacker, Greg Pargee, an all-league defensive back, and Phil 
Nemeth, who plays kicker, tight end, safety and fullback as well as anyone on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
There are concerns at quarterback where Phil Matheson, a junior split end, or 
Lenny Gavin, a sophomore left-hander from the junior varsity, are contending. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years Orange Lutheran had records of 6-4 and 7-3, finishing 
third in the Olympic League without gaining a playoff berth. (The Olympic 
League automatically advances two teams to the playoffs, not three as most 
leagues do.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's very frustrating to have to sit there and watch teams with worse records 
go on, Dowding." 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MARGARITA -- Although most consider Santa Margarita a growing evil 
empire, Hartigan notes that he has yet to have a senior on his team. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I had a hard time scheduling because people would say 'Oh, you're 
that giant waiting to awaken,' Hartigan said. "We do have a good football team, 
in two years we've gone 16-3-1, but people forget we're still at the lowest 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Because this is Santa Margarita's first varsity season, the Eagles have no 
returning starters. Nevertheless, there are plenty of players to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Kicker Travis Lucero had field goals of 43 yards as a freshman, and 48 yards as 
a sophomore, according to Hartigan. Lucero gets tips from former San Diego 
Charger kicker Vince Abbott, who was a teammate of Hartigan's at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Trevor Yankoff had 20 touchdowns -- 12 passing, 8 rushing -- last 
year, and Hartigan describes him as a quick, scrambling type with great 
instincts. Although only a sophomore, Josh Ireland, with quick, deceptive 
moves, will start at tailback. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Santa Margarita lacks size, 6-5, 280-pound offensive tackle Nathan 
Beckett shouldn't be taken lightly. "(He's) just starting to fill into his body 
. . . he's 15 years old and predicted to be 7-2," Hartigan said. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHRISTIAN -- The Flames were a try-out team in the 
Arrowhead League last year, going 7-3 overall before being eliminated in the 
first round of the Division IX playoffs by eventual champion Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
Although SCC lost Jason Parks, a 6-5, 250-pound tight end, (23 touchdown 
receptions) and star quarterback Wade Bowe (900 yards passing) to graduation, 
Flame Coach Rick Hayes says the team is better overall. 
</P>
<P>
Five two-way starters return in the line including guards Travis Jennings (6-4, 
210) and Eric Buzzone (6-0, 200), and tackles Justin Watson (6-4, 260) and Tony 
Dembowski (6-4, 185). 
</P>
<P>
Again, there are concerns at quarterback. Two choices: sophomore Nathan Lambie, 
up from the junior varsity, and Mike Nickerson, who may be converted from wide 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
WHITTIER CHRISTIAN -- The Heralds lost to graduation one of their best 
quarterbacks in recent years in Rich Earlywine, but the returning Papazian is 
stronger and has improved, Coach Phil Bravo says. 
</P>
<P>
USC, UCLA and Nebraska all are interested in him, Bravo said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron's demonstrated some great strides over the summer," Bravo said. "After 
accomplishing the things he did as a junior, there's not much more to 
accomplish as far as recognition goes. I've seen kids in that position relax, 
but from the day the season ended until now, Ron has been in the weight room 
and dedicated himself to getting better." 
</P>
<P>
The Heralds have 14 returning starters, with 40 players trying to make the 
varsity -- almost twice as many as most Olympic League teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Our overall team strength is great," Bravo said. "We had one our best 
off-season lifting programs this year. You give a kid a T-shirt (for lifting 
certain weights) and they run through brick walls for you." 
</P>
<P>
But aside from the numbers, Bravo said the team's draws strength is its unity. 
"(We have) more than I've ever seen here at this school," he said.

FERTIG QUITS UC IRVINE POST, PLANS TO SEEK JOB IN FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Fertig, the Associate Athletic Director for Development at UC Irvine, has 
resigned, school officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, Fertig has coordinated fund raising for the athletic 
department and served as executive director of the UCI Athletic Foundation. He 
said that he hopes to return to football. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I miss football," Fertig said. "I have enjoyed my experiences at 
UCI, I love the people and the school. I just feel that it is time to pursue 
interests in the football world." 
</P>
<P>
A former quarterback at USC, Fertig was an assistant coach at his alma mater 
for nine seasons before serving as head coach at Oregon State from 1976-79. He 
was a scout for the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1980-83. 
</P>
<P>
A replacement for Fertig at Irvine has not been named. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably get some help from the university Foundation," Irvine Director 
of Athletics John Caine said. "Others of us will help out in those areas, too."

MAZDA REALIGNS MANAGEMENT AT OFFICE IN IRVINE; 
</P>
<P>
COMBINES OPERATIONS, SALES, MARKETING GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mazda Motor of America said Wednesday that it has realigned management at the 
company's corporate headquarters in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring is intended to make the company more responsive to Mazda 
dealers and customers by streamlining operations, said spokesman Al Goldberg. 
"It's management fine-tuning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The realignment follows a major reorganization at Mazda 14 months ago, when the 
company centralized its U.S. sales operations in Irvine. At the time, Irvine 
was the regional office for 31 Central and Western states, with other regional 
importing and sales offices in Jacksonville, Fla., and Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's restructuring, the three offices were consolidated into one in 
Irvine, called Mazda Motor of America Inc., which is responsible for importing, 
marketing and selling Mazdas in the United States through its 844 dealers. 
After that consolidation, Mazda Motor of America still had separate groups for 
operations and for sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The changes announced this week are "the next step," basically eliminating 
those two groups, Goldberg said. In their place is a new operations group, 
which includes most of the functions of the former two groups. 
</P>
<P>
The new structure "will make it easier to communicate with dealers primarily," 
Goldberg said. "Now everything is under one responsibility -- rather than two 
separate groups with different management." 
</P>
<P>
George McCabe, formerly group vice president-sales and marketing, has been 
named group vice president-operations. His responsibilities include the 
company's five regional offices, sales operations, dealer development and 
advertising. That gives McCabe responsibility for more than half of Mazda's 
1,152 employees in the Irvine headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
McCabe joined Mazda in 1974 as a district sales manager in the New York area. 
He progressed steadily through the company's ranks and was named vice 
president-operations for Mazda Motor of America in 1986. Before joining Mazda, 
he was with the Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In other changes announced Wednesday, James Wiesner, formerly senior vice 
president-Eastern area operations, becomes assistant group vice 
president-sales, reporting to McCabe. Wiesner's responsibilities include sales 
planning, sales promotion and dealer development. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Thompson, vice president of advertising, will also report to McCabe, as 
will the managers of Mazda's five regional offices in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
New regional managers have been named to head Mazda's Pacific, Northeast and 
Southeast regions.

SHARP PLANS CHANGES AT IRVINE FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
HYCOM IS EXPECTED TO GROW AS COMPANY'S NEW U.S. SALES ARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sharp Corp., the Japanese electronics giant, said Wednesday that it has begun 
an expansion and major refocusing of its Irvine-based Hycom Inc. research firm. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to turn the small operation into Sharp's U.S. sales arm for the 
printers and other add-on equipment it sells to major computer manufacturers 
ultimately will add dozens of jobs at Hycom headquarters and, Sharp hopes, 
boost annual sales in the United States by hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
To run the new sales operation, Hycom has recruited Gregory J. Peel, former 
vice president of international sales for Western Digital Corp. in Irvine. As 
vice president of sales and marketing, Peel will share responsibility for the 
new operation with two longtime Sharp executives recently transferred to Hycom 
-- Toru (Ted) Kojima, vice president of operations, and Takehiro Hamanaka, 
corporate director and general manager of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Sharp required U.S. customers for its computer peripherals -- 
including printers, color scanners, monitors and information storage devices -- 
to buy directly from Japan. The process created a long pipeline and stunted 
Sharp's sales to American computer manufacturers, Peel said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In most of its worldwide markets, he said, Sharp's sales are derived almost 
equally from consumers and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
But Sharp's sales to computer makers, known as original equipment manufacturer, 
or OEM, sales, in the United States last year were "negligible" when compared 
to the $1.5 billion logged by its U.S. consumer electronics unit in New Jersey, 
according to Peel. 
</P>
<P>
Peel said that initial plans call for Hycom -- which now has about 30 
employees, to add about a dozen people to the sales staff. Further employment 
gains, he said, would come with sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
That growth could come rather quickly if Sharp is aggressive in its marketing 
efforts, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sharp has been increasing its role in the laptop computer market and has been 
an industry leader in color liquid crystal display technology," said Bill 
Lempesis, a computer-industry analyst with Dataquest Inc. in San Jose. The 
company's growing reputation as a portable computer maker, he said, could stand 
it in good stead in the increasingly competitive OEM market. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp officials said in a prepared statement that the company has built a new 
factory in Japan solely to provide products for the U.S. OEM market. 
</P>
<P>
Peel said that Hycom is expected to outgrow its current facility in Irvine by 
late next year but intends to stay in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its new emphasis on OEM sales, Hycom's original mission of electronics 
research and development will not be abandoned, Peel said. 
</P>
<P>
The company started in 1972 as a joint venture with a group of U.S. electronics 
engineers. Sharp, through its Sharp Microelectronics Technology Inc. subsidiary 
in Vancouver, Wash., acquired 100% of the company in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hycom brought its first commercial product -- an internal modem for personal 
computers -- to market earlier this year but has developed display-imaging 
systems, advanced computer chips and other products for Sharp and numerous 
other clients over the years, Hycom sales manager Jerry Henricks said.

FHP INTERNATIONAL SHOWS A SURGE IN EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FHP International Corp., a Fountain Valley-based health maintenance 
organization, reported strong earnings growth Wednesday for fiscal 1989 and the 
fourth quarter ended June 30, largely on the strength of growing membership, 
higher rates and containment of costs. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported net income of $7.7 million for its fourth quarter, up 
26.2% from $6.1 million for the same period a year ago. FHP's revenue for the 
fourth quarter ended June 30 increased 37% to $199.3 million from $145.1 
million for the fourth quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
For all of fiscal 1989, the company's net income was $22 million, up 33.3% from 
$16.5 million a year ago, and revenue rose to $699.1 million from $503.5 
million in fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that while the HMO industry over the last 12 months has 
been recovering from a financial depression, FHP continues to do better than 
its competitors because of more efficient cost controls and its success in 
developing a program for Medicare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Dr. Robert Gumbiner, chairman and chief executive 
officer at FHP, said the company's revenue and income growth "were driven by 
robust membership growth, continued cost-effective management of medical 
resources, rate increases from commercial groups and the federal government and 
increased interest income." 
</P>
<P>
He added that during the year, the company opened or expanded nine medical 
centers in four states and moved into six new market areas in Southern 
California. In June, the company also acquired its first skilled nursing 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
FHP's enrollment expanded 24.9% in fiscal 1989 to 466,000 members from 373,000, 
an achievement that industry analysts and company officials attribute in part 
to an exodus from traditional indemnity insurance by employers unwilling to pay 
skyrocketing rates. 
</P>
<P>
Also, FHP picked up some former Maxicare members when that Los Angeles-based 
HMO filed last March for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code. 
</P>
<P>
A nationwide reduction in the number of HMOs and indemnity health insurance 
plans, analysts say, has taken the steam out of a price war that formerly raged 
in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a consolidation under way in the industry, and those who are 
surviving are benefiting from price raises," said Lucy Olwell, health care 
analyst with Merrill Lynch Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, FHP prices are attractive to subscribers because they have not 
risen as high as the cost of traditional indemnity health insurance. "The 
insurance companies have set a pricing umbrella for us, and we have come in 
under that umbrella," said FHP spokeswoman Anna Marie Dunlap.

ALLERGAN LOWERS ITS EARLIER SALES PROJECTION FOR '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing pressure from competing manufacturers and delay in the release of a new 
product, Allergan Inc. said Wednesday that it is lowering its previously 
announced sales expectations for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, the Irvine-based maker of eye-care products said that 
sales were lower than anticipated in its Allergan Optical division due to 
competition and a decline in the market for new contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company said, shipment of a new ophthalmic instrument 
manufactured by its Allergan Humphrey unit has been delayed, based on results 
of recent clinical evaluations and the emergence of new technology.

HUNTINGTON BEACH CLOSE-UP MAGICIAN JOHNNY ACE PALMER SEEKS STAR STATUS FOR HIS 
ART

<P>
The "World Champion Magician" is living in Huntington Beach and is setting up 
shop in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
His name probably won't be recognized by anyone who isn't familiar with magic's 
inner circle, its esoteric ins and outs. But once you've seen him, Johnny Ace 
Palmer may not be a name you'll forget. He's bringing his "close-up magic" act 
to the 45-seat Backstage Theatre for a 12-week run that starts tonight. Also on 
the bill: comedian/magician T.C. Tahoe and manipulation magician Mitch 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Close-up magic deals with small objects -- cards, coins, thimbles, finger 
rings, cups and balls -- and is featured mostly at small gatherings, on 
restaurant tables and in convention hospitality suites. Relying on 
sleight-of-hand, misdirection, and the performer's originality and personality 
-- all at very close range -- it's at the extreme opposite end of the spectrum 
from large, Las Vegas-style illusion shows with their high-tech boxes, exotic 
animals and scantily clad assistants. 
</P>
<P>
In an age that finds the airwaves reserved for performers who can make an 
elephant -- or a jet, or the Statue of Liberty -- disappear, it's no surprise 
that no close-up magician has attained the star status of a David Copperfield 
or a Doug Henning. Still, Palmer is gaining notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he became the first close-up magician ever to win one of magic's 
most prestigious competitions, the Grande Prix Championship at the Hague, the 
Netherlands. It was there that he was crowned "World Champion." 
</P>
<P>
"It was my lifetime goal," says the 29-year-old. And now, he has another 
lifetime goal: to bring close-up magic the popularity -- and, to magic in 
general, the acclaim -- he feels it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
"People usually ask, when I say I'm a magician, 'Do you do birthday parties?' 
When my fiancee says I'm a magician, people always ask, 'Oh really, does he 
pull rabbits out of hats? Does he saw ladies in half? Does he make you 
disappear?' 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a bad reputation." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer's interest in magic was sparked when he was a toddler in Warren, Ohio. 
His grandfather used to play a game with him called "where-go," hiding such 
objects as coins and marbles and asking Johnny to find them. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked (the idea) of hiding things and finding things, the trickiness of it," 
Palmer recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Around the same time, "my dad showed me a card trick, and then I showed it to 
his friends. It was a simple card trick -- but a lot of times in magic, simple 
tricks can fool the most complex minds. Anyway, it fooled all his friends. They 
all asked how I did it. I got a lot of attention, and it made them laugh and 
smile. I enjoyed that." 
</P>
<P>
He learned more tricks from books and then started trading tricks with other 
people. And by the time he was 5 years old, he knew what he wanted to do for a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
He got his first paying job at age 12, doing a stand-up parlor style show at a 
church. He got $20. "My mom was a single parent since I was 9, and I helped buy 
groceries with my magic. My magic supplemented the family budget. I was doing 
birthday parties, church shows, even club dates. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In high school, his nickname was "the magician." He paid his own way through 
Kent State University doing magic tricks. He majored in psychology and theater. 
</P>
<P>
"People enjoy the fun parts of magic," he says. " I like to make it fun. . . . 
Your attitude is crucial. I feel I was put on this earth to do magic -- 
specifically close-up magic, because that's what I do best." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Ace Palmer, Mitch Williams and T.C. Tahoe open Thursday at the 
Backstage Theatre, 2691 Richter St., Irvine. Continues Thursdays through 
Sundays at 7 and 9 p.m. with Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2, through Nov. 
26. Tickets: $7 to $10. Information: (714) 553-8066.

POPBEAT / MIKE BOEHM: REPLICATE OF BAND SAYS A REMOTE, PAT YES TO NOSTALGIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It's a reliable high. Each fix just the same -- and you've had so many. The 
stuff isn't hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
It goes down easy, and it lets you escape the demands of having to deal with 
the strange, ever-changing here and now. You crave that familiar rush. It 
reminds you of the first time, when that high took you somewhere new and fine. 
</P>
<P>
But this habit has gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
Please. Just say no. 
</P>
<P>
Just say no to Classic Rock. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night at the Pacific Amphitheatre, they all said Yes. Well, not exactly 
Yes. That really would have been illegal. Singer Jon Anderson, drummer Bill 
Bruford, keyboard player Rick Wakeman and guitarist Steve Howe -- augmented 
these days by three other musicians -- are not allowed to call themselves Yes 
anymore, having lost to a lineup of rival former Yes men in a legal dispute 
over rights to the name. 
</P>
<P>
But by whatever name, it still was Yes. Yes to nostalgia. Yes to repetition of 
the familiar. Yes to a band content for the most part to coast on what it 
accomplished before 1973. Yes to Classic Rock, the radio format that keeps 
listeners hooked on what music was, and deaf to what today's more vital 
musicians are struggling to become. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pacific, Anderson, Bruford, et al. replayed a slew of songs from Yes's 
classic rock file in note-for-note replications of the originals, along with 
selections from ABWH's new album, a reasonably melodic yet still wan imitation 
of meatier Yes material. 
</P>
<P>
Those replications were, of course, well wrought. Nobody ever said these guys 
couldn't play: Virtuosity was always their main attraction. Bruford, Howe and 
Wakeman, in his long, white formal jacket, resembled nothing so much as a 
buffet server as he moved from spot to spot behind an aproned, semicircular 
table full of keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
Wakeman showed that their limbs and fingers are still nimble and fleet, and 
Anderson still sings in his distinctive, melodious choirboy fashion. 
</P>
<P>
But ABWH's show was far too pat (though it did not seem to bother an audience 
that bestowed ovation after standing ovation). Reeling off an evening of 
classic rock was so easy that the group forgot that a concert should have a bit 
of a human touch, a stroke of immediacy that says a moment is being lived, not 
relived. 
</P>
<P>
The lyrics on ABWH's new album talk a lot about the reunion of long-lost 
brothers and such. But there was little comradeship evident on stage. Each 
member of the foursome had his own sector of the stage and seldom left it. 
</P>
<P>
Only Anderson spoke -- perfunctorily. There were no humanizing reminiscences, 
no banter, no revelation of personality, no updates on where everyone had been 
since the good old days. There were no introductions of the supporting players, 
and no acknowledgement of the one thing that had the potential to give the show 
an interesting subtext: bassist Jeff Berlin, an old cohort of Bruford, was 
playing only his second show with the band as an emergency substitute for Tony 
Levin. Levin, a veteran session bassist best known for his work in Peter 
Gabriel's band, has been hospitalized since being stricken with hepatitis while 
on tour last week. 
</P>
<P>
What little interaction there was took place between Bruford and Berlin, who 
monitored each other's playing, as good rhythm teams do. Anderson, decked out 
in his customary billowy white suit, kept to his own space at center stage 
where he continuously struck his customary poses, alternately pious-looking or 
fey. Wakeman, in his long, white formal jacket, resembled nothing so much as a 
buffet server as he moved from spot to spot behind an aproned, semicircular 
table full of keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
Only Howe put some charge into the proceedings, showing a sense of enjoyment in 
playing classy guitar lines that he created more than 15 years ago. The 
strongest moments of the 2 1/2-hour show came during "Heart of the Sunrise," 
"Roundabout" and "Starship Trooper" (a full-length, 20-minute rehash of "Close 
to the Edge" could have been dropped). 
</P>
<P>
Classic rock can be transformed into still-fresh music if the songs have 
interesting, pertinent lyrics. But Anderson's lyrics, with their hazy 
philosophizing, seldom pertain to anything very striking in the world as we 
might know it or imagine it. They function mainly as strands of vaguely 
profound verbiage on which to hang melodic decor. 
</P>
<P>
ABWH had one chance to make its concert more than an exercise in nostalgia: It 
might have refashioned familiar songs in surprising new ways. But that happened 
only during the first number, when Anderson sang a medley of "Time and a Word" 
and "Owner of a Lonely Heart," backed by acoustic guitar. Howe followed with 
two lovely solo acoustic guitar melodies; then Wakeman had his own solo moment 
of keyboard gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this interesting coffeehouse version of Yes was misplaced. It 
would have been better to start with an ensemble bang, then break down into 
quieter, individual moments that, ideally, would have afforded a chance for 
each member to greet the audience and show a bit of extra-musical personality. 
</P>
<P>
British progressive rockers often rely on elaborate lighting and props to make 
up for their customary lack of a strong stage personality. ABWH's lighting 
scheme was dull, except for a grand finale in which a peace sign etched on 
glass shone above the stage. The unimaginative stage set featured a spiny, 
bony-looking contraption that moved occasionally above the drum riser. 
</P>
<P>
Could it have been a crab, scuttling across the floor of a Topographic Ocean?

COST STALLS QUEST FOR BLACK ACTORS THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest effort to install the Orange County Black Actors Theatre in a 
permanent home has fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost was just too prohibitive," artistic director Adleane Hunter said 
Wednesday of an announced plan to transform a downtown Santa Ana storefront 
into a cultural facility that would include a 100-seat theater and an art 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the theater's board of directors had been negotiating for the 
6,000-square-foot store at Main Street and Washington Avenue, and Hunter had 
said she hoped to begin mounting a season of plays there by January along with 
a series of art exhibitions, jazz and blues programs, poetry readings and drama 
workshops. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way of opening at this point," she said from Los Angeles, where 
she was rehearsing the world premiere of Samm-Art Williams' "Woman From Town" 
at the Inner City Theatre for another troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Expenses at the storefront in Santa Ana would have come to about $7,000 per 
month, Hunter said, far greater than the $2,500 range that she and the board 
member, Mae Ussery of Irvine, were willing to commit. 
</P>
<P>
She said the county's only black theater troupe has not given up its search for 
affordable space in Santa Ana and will continue to operate in the county, even 
though she herself will move move to San Diego County in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she noted, a separate search for theater operating funds continues. 
Hunter said the company has just prepared a three-year proposal, asking for 
$280,000 to underwrite expenses for facilities, staffing and some production 
costs. The proposal is being circulated to private foundations, arts agencies 
and corporations, she said. "We were just turned down by the National Endowment 
for the Arts for a $43,000 grant, though we'd been told it was a strong 
application," Hunter said. "So now we're back to square one."

LATINOS SPREAD WORD ABOUT ORCHESTRA 
</P>

Rudy Montejano looked around the roped-off picnic area at Irvine Meadows on 
Saturday night like a proud papa on graduation day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an excellent turnout for us," said Montejano, a Santa Ana attorney and 
Latino activist who heads the Santiago Club, a local philanthropic group. 
</P>
<P>
Montejano is also chairman of the Hispanic Advisory Committee of the Pacific 
Symphony. Hence his delight at seeing about 200 participants in the committee's 
pre-concert picnic. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, formed less than a year ago, works to "increase awareness of 
Hispanics to classical music and get more Hispanics involved with the 
orchestra," Montejano said. "This is a natural progression (for local Latinos), 
who now have more discretionary income and so are now able to participate more 
fully in society." 
</P>
<P>
Among those participating on Saturday was Joe Elias, a Santa Ana retailer who 
came to the picnic with his wife, Ruth, and 9-year-old daughter, Sharon. Elias 
praised Montejano for taking "a positive position for the betterment of the 
Hispanic community," and he added a few hopeful words of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"In our community, a lot of information travels by word of mouth," he said. 
"There's a tendency among Hispanics to spread the good word -- so if there are 
200 here tonight, next year there will be more." 
</P>
<P>
The picnic began at 6:30 p.m. and included a buffet dinner of beef teriyaki, 
sesame chicken, salad and fresh fruit. A refreshment stand served beer and wine 
donated by the Santiago Club. Los Luis mariachis strummed and strolled through 
the small groups that were settled on blankets and eating near a temporary 
stage at one end of the roped-off lawn. 
</P>
<P>
John Acosta, Santa Ana mayor pro tem, said that when he was a child, he longed 
to take guitar lessons, "even though I can't carry a tune in a bucket" -- and 
even though his parents, both migrant workers, had all they could handle 
financially just to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
"Each generation moves a little bit farther ahead of the last," Acosta said. 
"Now, I have a piano in my home, and when my grandchildren come over, they bang 
on that piano. They know I won't get mad at them. I love music. Music is good 
for your soul." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's concert featured classical guitarist Angel Romero, a native of Spain 
and internationally known performer. For Ed Lucero, who attended the picnic and 
concert with friends Javier Campos and Lillian Somerville, the chance to hear 
Romero was the main draw. 
</P>
<P>
"The music in this program interests me," said Lucero, who heads Relampago del 
Cielo, a Mexican folk dance troupe based in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a great opportunity for a lot of Hispanics who don't usually 
participate in this kind of music because they can identify with the artist. 
Especially the kids. It's not just another person, you know? Because it's 
(Romero), somehow it lets them say, 'Hey, if he can do that, maybe I can, too.' 
"

IT'S ONLY THE ONE AND ONLY GROUCHO, BUT DON'T TELL THE LADY WITH THE POOL

Although he was nothing like his madcap screen image, Groucho Marx was, as 
announcer George Fenneman would say, "the one and only Groucho." 
</P>
<P>
Groucho's daughter, Miriam Marx Allen, remembers one time in the 1930s when MGM 
director Archie Mayo was building a house across the street from the Marxes' 
Beverly Hills home. The pool was already finished, and Mayo told Groucho, "Any 
time you want to use our pool, go on over." 
</P>
<P>
One Saturday morning, Allen said, she, her brother Arthur and Groucho were 
swimming in the pool when Mayo's sister arrived to show the house to friends. 
She was angry to find strangers in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going on here?" she demanded. "What are you doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
Groucho, who was seldom recognized in the '30s without his false movie 
mustache, replied: "Well, we were just walking down the street, it was hot, and 
we thought we'd take a swim." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said they got out of the pool, but Groucho never let on who he was.

LIFE ON WHEELS: WINDSHIELD TO THE FUTURE: VISIONS OF HIGHWAYS PASS TEST OF TIME

I've got some futures to share with you today. They're not soybean or pork 
belly or crude oil futures, but highway futures. 
</P>
<P>
Please, don't send money -- now or ever. These aren't exactly investments. They 
were once speculations. Now they're only futures from the past. 
</P>
<P>
I picked them up cheap at library used-book sales in various parts of the 
county. They'd been stamped "Discard" and left on tables in the hot sun, 
banished from the shelves forever. But I figured they might still have some 
value, so I dug out a few quarters and brought them home. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest of the bunch is "The Story of American Roads" by Val Hart, published 
in 1950. Hart spends most of the book on the history of roads. 
</P>
<P>
After taking the reader along El Camino Real, the Santa Fe Trail and the 
Alaskan Highway, Hart describes the situation at press time: 
</P>
<P>
"In 1950, nearly 2 billion dollars was allotted for highway construction, and 
another billion and a half for highway maintenance. Still, the roads are not 
good enough. Many are obsolete, and nearly all suffer from the creaking 
infirmities of a too-active old age. On some roads the surface is obsolete, and 
roads today are too narrow, too crooked and too rambling. Seldom are cities 
connected by the most direct route. Today, as always in the past, vehicles are 
far ahead of roads. 
</P>
<P>
"Long stretches out in the country are good enough to permit an average speed 
of 47 m.p.h. But when roads approach cities it is easy to see that they have 
long been out of date. Motorists who have inched and crawled through endless 
miles of slow-moving cars, trying to enter or leave a city, know how inadequate 
our roads are. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
From there, Hart heads into uncharted territory -- the "highway of tomorrow": 
</P>
<P>
"Today our roads are at a turning point; but at least we know now what is 
needed and what we have to do. The federal government has appropriated vast 
sums for road building, and long-range planning gives some assurance that when 
we do have these expressways, they will not become obsolete before they wear 
out. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The roads we are planning and building in the United States today are 
far better than any the Romans ever built -- and should last as long. We cannot 
say how long they will be adequate, because we cannot anticipate the vehicle of 
the distant future. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We can see the beginning of future changes right now. . . . People (will be 
able to) live anywhere, and with all the comforts of city dwelling, since fuel, 
food, and everything necessary to living can be brought to them by truck over 
highways. Automobiles can take them back and forth to work, school buses can 
take their children to and from good schools. Factories built on any highway in 
the United States are now connected with every other factory, because of 
highway transportation. Thus industries are able to decentralize . . . in this 
atomic age it seems a good thing to do, for industrial as well as military 
reasons. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But Hart counsels us to be patient: "Perhaps as many as 10, 15, or even 20 
years will pass before we actually have under our wheels all the completed 
mileage planned for our expressways and other roads." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the college textbook "Politics and Government in California," 
published in 1961. In a chapter called "The Challenges to Government in 
California," authors Bernard L. Hyink, Seyom Brown and Ernest W. Thacker 
address the problem of traffic congestion: 
</P>
<P>
"The state's principal answer to its traffic congestion problem has been the 
huge freeway construction program, financed by taxes on motorists. Although a 
substantial improvement, both in terms of commuter time saved and diminished 
accident rates, the freeways thus far constructed provide only a small opening 
in the traffic bottleneck. . . . Often between the start of construction of a 
freeway and the cutting of the ribbon at its dedication the increase in the 
volume of traffic of the locality has made the new facility inadequate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There is general agreement that more freeways will ease the traffic problem. 
Accordingly . . . the state department of public works . . . in 1958 . . . 
published a report recommending a comprehensive system of freeways which by 
1980 would connect every section of the state, with 12,000 miles of concrete 
ribbon touching almost every town with a population of 5,000 or more. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There is also continuous research . . . on how to improve the design and use 
of freeways. Suggestions include: more adequate on-and-off ramps, special 
control devices such as radar, roadside telephones, helicopter 'air-watch' and 
appropriate signals and signs, controlling traffic flow at rush periods by 
limiting freeways to through traffic, or making freeways one-way into town in 
the morning and out of town in the evenings. Governments could also participate 
in the establishment of systematized car pooling. And it has been urged that 
trucks, buses and other slow-moving vehicles be restricted in their use of 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, there is a need to provide better public transportation, 
including the development of new modes of transport such as the overhead 
monorail or helicopter buses." 
</P>

Gov. George Deukmejian might well have run across the same book at his local 
library's used book sale, too, judging from his 1989 "State of the State" 
address: 
</P>
<P>
"I want to unlock gridlock in our state with a two-track approach: build more 
roads where needed, and make better use of the transportation system that we 
already have. 
</P>
<P>
"We must not underestimate the impact that ride-sharing, mass transit, and 
better transit management can have on congestion," the governor said on Jan. 
10. "I also believe that it is time to seriously consider restricting 
commercial truck traffic on our freeways during peak hours in urban areas. We 
must also finance and build more highways in California." 
</P>
<P>
My favorite future, however, is depicted in a children's book, "From Footpaths 
to Freeways: The Story of Roads" by Solveig Paulson Russell, published in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of roads will the future bring? This is a question that people 
wonder and worry about. Now many people are crowded into cities. Growing 
numbers of cars add impurities to the air through their exhaust pipes, and 
roads are so congested at times that cars move bumper-to-bumper. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many cars now for the roads we have . . . we need to have fewer 
people. We need to have transportation that will not increase the number of 
cars, but lessen them -- perhaps ways that many people can use at the same 
time, such as speed trains between cities, or some kind of local air travel. 
New roadways are using up space that needs to be saved for farming and for 
recreation, or pleasure. How can we cut down the number of cars, and keep the 
air fit to breathe and live in? How can people move about in better, 
less-crowded ways? 
</P>
<P>
"Many solutions and plans are being thought about and considered for these 
problems. Among them is, of course, having cars run by some power other than 
gasoline, such as electricity. . . . Another thought is to have cars move by 
radar or some other kind of electronic device built into the highways. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"New ideas for safety include lighting the road surface itself so that cars 
would always travel on a lighted ribbon of roadway at night, and making high, 
curved edges at each side of roads to force cars back to the road if they go 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
"To help crowded conditions, people are thinking of putting elevated sidewalks 
in cities and towns, high above the streets; making two-deck roadways for cars; 
building highways on bridges above the land so that the land under them could 
be used; having highways tunnel underground; and making main motorways across 
the country that would avoid all cities, but have roads leading into them. Some 
of these things are already being done, but in a very small way. How many of 
these ideas, and others, will be carried out remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe these future visions aren't so out of date after all. I wonder if the 
library would like them back.

ASK THE VET: EARLY TRAINING OK FOR PUPS; KEEP IT SIMPLE

Q: Is an 18-week-old puppy too young to start obedience training? I have a 
black lab pup that seems very bright, and I would like to start her on her 
training. Every class that I have contacted says to wait until she is 6 months 
old. Is there something else that I can do? 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Belshaw,

</P>
<P>
A: You can start to train your pup at any age as long as you keep the tasks 
very simple, use one-word commands and realize that a young puppy has a very 
short attention span and will lose interest in any type of training after about 
15 or 20 minutes. If you start off by teaching her name and basic commands, 
such as come, stay, and no, you will be ahead of the game when she enters 
obedience classes. Be patient, use a gentle voice and keep it simple. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently took my two children, 6- and 8-year-old boys, to our doctor 
because they had some bald, red spots on their skin. The doctor said it was 
ringworm and, during his background check on the boys, asked if we had any 
pets. We have two cats, both females, which go in and out of doors. We were 
told to have our cats checked, since they were probably the source of the skin 
infection of our boys. Our vet checked the cats with ultraviolet light and 
found no ringworm. Where could the boys have gotten ringworm? Is there another 
way to check the cats? If they do have ringworm, do we have to get rid of the 
cats? The boys are being treated and are doing well. What do you suggest? 
</P>
<P>
M.L.D., Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
A: Ringworm is a common name for any fungal infection of the skin that causes a 
circular lesion with hair loss. These infections are caused by types of fungal 
organisms, more than 20 of which infect man and 10 to 12 of which infect 
animals. Of all these different fungi, only about four affect both man and 
animals. The most common fungus is called Microsporum canis, which affects cats 
and dogs as well as man. These fungi are all soil-borne that can be highly 
contagious to susceptible people, such as children. It is not uncommon for cats 
or dogs to spread the fungus to children or for children to spread it to their 
pets or members of the family. When examining a cat for ringworm, the coat is 
checked for any loss of hair or for thin, crusty lesions that generally do not 
itch. Ultraviolet light is routinely used to find the spores of the fungus. The 
spores will appear lime-green on the hair shafts. However, not all of these 
spores will show up. It may be wise to remove some hair from a suspected area 
and place it on a dermatophyte culture to see if the fungus will grow. The hair 
shafts can also be treated with an agent and checked under a microscope for 
spores. If your cats do have ringworm, they can be treated by medicated baths, 
topical medication, oral medication -- if the infection is widespread -- and 
clipping the affected areas. If the cats are infected, it would not be 
necessary to get rid of them, although it might be necessary to confine them 
and restrict their contact with family members until their condition is 
cleared.

PARTS OF BURBANK, GLENDALE SPRAYED TO WIPE OUT ORIENTAL FRUIT FLIES 
</P>

<P>
The discovery of three Oriental fruit flies has prompted ground spraying of the 
pesticide Dibrom in a nine-square-mile area of Burbank and Glendale, Los 
Angeles County officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment area encompasses an 8 1/2-square-mile area of Burbank bounded by 
Empire Avenue on the north, the Ventura Freeway on the south, Hollywood Way on 
the west, and Kenneth Road to Western Avenue on the east, said Bob Atkins, Los 
Angeles County deputy agricultural commissioner. The Western Avenue portion 
includes a half-mile-area of west Glendale, Atkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The spraying began Saturday, a day after the discovery, and will continue over 
the next several weeks, Atkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oriental fruit fly attacks more than 230 different fruits and vegetables, 
including apples, avocados and bananas. Although it poses as serious a threat 
to agriculture as the Mediterranean fruit fly, Atkins said, the Oriental fruit 
fly is much easier to eradicate. He said the sex lure methyl eugenol, used to 
attract male flies to the pesticide Dibrom, is much more effective than the 
bait used to attract the Medfly.

2 GUNMEN KILL ARMORED CAR GUARD, WOUND 2 AT B OF A IN SAN FRANCISCO

An armored car guard was killed and two other men were seriously wounded today 
when two muscular holdup men opened fire inside Bank of America's world 
headquarters during an armored car robbery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers reportedly fled on bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a well-planned, well-orchestrated robbery," Deputy Chief Larry 
Gurnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer David Ambrose said it appeared that the robbers entered the opposite 
side of the 55-story building from the two Brink's Inc. guards and the four men 
met near a candy counter by the indoor entrance to the Bank of America branch. 
</P>
<P>
For some reason the men wearing ski masks and baseball caps opened fire, 
felling the two guards, Ambrose said. The third man, attracted to the scene by 
the shots, may have tried to intervene before he was wounded in the mouth, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on what, if anything, was taken during the holdup. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described the gunmen as two white males in their 30s. 
</P>
<P>
At San Francisco General Hospital, a spokeswoman said the dead Brink's guard, 
identified as John Arriola of Vallejo, suffered gunshot wounds to the face and 
the back of the head. The other wounded guard was shot above the left eyebrow 
and was listed in stable condition. The witness, wounded in the mouth, was also 
in fair condition.

FRANK ADMITS HE CANCELED LOVER'S PARKING TICKETS

Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) said today that he used his congressional immunity 
to write off delinquent parking tickets for a personal aide who also was a male 
prostitute, but only when the assistant was on official business for him. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said the aide, Stephen L. Gobie, had used his car while on official 
business and had access to the car when he was away. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some occasions when tickets were issued even though the car was 
being used on official business," Frank said in a statement. "I did ask that 
such tickets be waived" by writing to the House sergeant-at-arms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank's statement elaborated on comments he made in an interview published in 
today's editions of the Washington Times. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker branded as "lies" Gobie's assertion to the paper that Frank had 
knowingly intervened to waive tickets the aide received while using Frank's car 
to keep appointments for illicit sex. 
</P>
<P>
Gobie, who contends that he operated an escort service using Frank's car and 
Capitol Hill apartment, told the newspaper he used the car to transport 
prostitutes and even to have sex.

Black activists today said at least 25 people of black and mixed race were 
killed in election night clashes with police who marched through townships 
firing shotguns and tear gas to break up protests. 
</P>
<P>
Media reports and a church monitoring group said at least 100 people were 
injured in more than 20 townships, and one police officer said others 
indiscriminately beat and whipped blacks, including bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said 25 people were killed, mostly in the 
mixed-race townships around Cape Town. 
</P>

'A War Zone' 
</P>
<P>
The independent South African Press Assn. described the area as "a war zone . . 
. as residents danced around dozens of burning barricades blocking streets in 
the area and police fired repeatedly at groups of youths." 
</P>
<P>
One local newspaper, Grassroots, said it had confirmed that 15 bodies were in a 
local mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
The governing National Party narrowly retained its majority in Wednesday's 
parliamentary elections, which excluded the black majority. 
</P>
<P>
Acting President Frederik W. de Klerk today said the results of national 
elections show that most white voters support his plan to grant some political 
rights to blacks, despite his party's worst showing in 41 years in losing 
nearly a quarter of its seats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30 Seats Lost 
</P>
<P>
With votes counted in all of 166 election districts, it appeared the 
Nationalists will retain at least 93 of their previous 123 seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Police headquarters in Pretoria said that an unspecified number of people were 
killed and that there were 200 incidents of unrest, including rock throwing, 
arson and unapproved gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they used tear gas, rubber bullets and shotguns to disperse 
peaceful placard-carrying marchers as well as stone-throwing mobs. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, journalists saw five white policemen flanked by a yellow armored 
vehicle walking through the mixed-race township of Manenberg outside Cape Town. 
They said the officers slowly raised their shotguns and tear gas rifles and 
fired straight ahead and down side streets as they marched along. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of mixed-race youths, men and women had set fire to burning barricades 
of tree branches, newspapers and mattresses at each end of the street. 
</P>
<P>
They were dancing and talking in the street but scattered behind fences and 
into houses when the armored vehicle rolled over the first barricade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Riot Squads Blamed 
</P>
<P>
A mixed-race police lieutenant in the Mitchell's Plain area of Cape Town said 
police riot squads were "the cause of the riots" in that area Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gregory Rockman, 30, said a white riot squad major threatened to detain him 
under emergency regulations when he tried to stop officers from hitting 
bystanders as well as students holding a placard demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"They just stormed and hit them whenever they felt like doing that. They hit 
them like mad," Rockman said. 
</P>
<P>
He said four officers joined to beat with whips a woman waiting for a bus.

BENNETT PROMISED HELP ON DRUGS, CHIDED OVER GUNS

Drug czar William J. Bennett today won a Democratic Senate committee chairman's 
promise of cooperation to hasten legislation launching the war on drugs but 
came under renewed fire over the Administration's refusal to expand 
prohibitions against assault rifles said to be favored by drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"From the Congress we need not only support for our ideas but also a speedy 
reallocation of federal dollars necessary to implement this anti-drug program," 
Bennett said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to complaints by some Democrats after President Bush announced the 
plan Tuesday, the hearing was relatively smooth. Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. 
Biden Jr. (D-Del.) urged expedited talks aimed at putting the legislation "on a 
fast track." 
</P>
<P>
The mainly warm reception that Bennett received from the committee was broken 
only when Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) questioned him about the 
Administration's continued refusal to ban American-made assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration barred import of a number of the military-style weapons 
earlier this year, but it has not moved against domestic weapons. The National 
Rifle Assn. has been lobbying hard to block gun bills in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said recent seizures in Colombian drug raids show that "half of the 
guns that are used locally are being manufactured here in the United States of 
America." 
</P>
<P>
"The American people I think want action with regard to the weapons of choice 
of these thugs and mobsters on the streets, and they're being exported and used 
to gun down members of the judiciary in Colombia and other places," he said.

Attorneys for Welsh singer Tom Jones reached tentative agreement today on 
child-support payments for a 14-month-old boy the entertainer fathered during a 
two-night 1987 visit to Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
But the settlement failed to assuage the feelings of the child's mother, 
Katherine Berkery, 27. "I think he's a disgusting human being," she said after 
the agreement was reached during a two-hour, closed-door negotiating session in 
Family Court.

Although no support figure was announced, Berkery's lawyer was reportedly 
seeking $3,800 a month and Berkery said she was "very happy with what I'm going

The overwhelming majority of Latino immigrants -- 98% -- say they intend to 
stay in the United States, but many say they've delayed applying for 
citizenship because the exam is too difficult, a survey released today said. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the survey's findings, many of our society's assumptions about 
Latino immigrants will need to be re-examined," the National Assn. of Latino 
Elected and Appointed Officials group said. "Foremost among these assumptions 
is the perception that Latino immigrants are here temporarily and are planning 
to return to their homelands upon accumulation of savings or upon retirement." 
</P>
<P>
The average European and Asian immigrant waits seven to eight years before 
naturalizing, but Latino immigrants wait an average of 14 to 15 years, the 
association said. However, once Latino immigrants take the exam, the survey 
said, most pass and don't find it difficult.

Blindfolded, bleeding and trapped in the basement crawl space of her burning 
home, a rape victim scrawled her attacker's name in blood with bound hands and 
then made a desperate escape, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Donnie next door," she scratched on the wall Wednesday, minutes after she was 
raped, robbed, slashed and beaten, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Her home had been set on fire and she had been left to die in the crawl space 
sealed shut with furniture, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old woman was reported in fair condition today at Denver General 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Her head throbbing from a hammer beating and her hand bleeding from a knife 
wound, she had managed to kick her way out of the crawl space and break her 
basement window with the knife with which she was stabbed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Half-nude, blood-caked and clutching the foot-long knife, the woman scaled a 
6-foot fence in her back yard and ran through her neighborhood screaming for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Police said terrified neighbors, unsure whether she was running from trouble or 
looking for it, shut their doors. 
</P>
<P>
But after hearing the woman's weak moans, one neighbor did phone police. 
</P>
<P>
As paramedics treated the woman moments later, the neighbor saw smoke flowing 
from her clapboard-and-brick house. A fire truck was summoned, and firefighters 
quickly doused the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Police were searching for the suspect, identified as Donnie E. Russell, 18. The 
teen-ager, whom the victim has known for two years, allegedly got into her 
house about 10 a.m. by asking to use her telephone, police said.

BRITAIN'S POLLY PECK TO BUY PART OF DEL MONTE CO.

British-based trading and manufacturing group Polly Peck International PLC said 
today it plans to acquire the fresh fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Del 
Monte Co. for $875 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the unit by RJR Nabisco is part of a planned divestiture of $6 
billion of food division assets to pay for its $25-billion leveraged buyout 
headed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The deal required a number of asset sales to pay down the massive debt in the 
leveraged buyout that ranked as the largest corporate acquisition on record. 
</P>
<P>
Polly Peck said in a statement that the acquisition would give it exclusive 
rights to use Del Monte's brand name on fresh fruit and vegetables worldwide. 
RJR Nabisco will retain the trademarks for use on processed foods and in other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Polly Peck Chairman Asil Nadir said: "The acquisition represents a remarkable 
opportunity for PPI to establish itself as one of the world's largest suppliers 
of fresh fruit and vegetables." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Objectives Achieved 
</P>
<P>
He said the acquisition achieved two of his group's principal strategic 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
"It establishes a significant presence in the North American market, and PPI 
becomes a world-class player in the fresh fruit industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two businesses are complementary, Polly Peck said. Del Monte is strong in 
bananas and pineapples and in the American and Asian markets, while Polly Peck 
is stronger in citrus fruits and many European markets. 
</P>
<P>
Polly Peck's expertise in shipping, packing and handling should enable it to 
make significant savings in Del Monte's fresh fruit costs, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Del Monte Fresh Fruit had an operating profit of $79 million on sales of $600 
million in 1988.

LLOYD'S OF LONDON REPORTS REBOUNDING PROFITS

<P>
The Lloyd's of London insurance market, which reports results three years in 
arrears because of long delays in settling claims, said today that profits 
rebounded strongly in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It put pretax profit for the year at $1 billion at current exchange rates, more 
than three times its profits of $303 million in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show underwriting profit of $1.15 billion and total net 
premium income of $5.75 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's Chairman Murray Lawrence said that although prospects for 1987 were 
encouraging, results for the next three years would be less spectacular, with 
marine and aviation markets in particular unlikely to produce satisfactory 
profits in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"There are signs that some important areas of the market are approaching the 
bottom of the trough, and I believe that during 1990, rates in these areas 
should begin to harden and move upward to more realistic levels," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The marine market had an underwriting return of 19.7% before currency gains, 
but excessive capacity and worsening claims were producing unfavorable 
conditions.

The United States has given South Korea five months to resolve 
telecommunications disputes or risk trade sanctions, Seoul officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
They also said little progress was being made in the first round of U.S.-South 
Korean talks on opening Seoul's market to American telecommunication goods and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. delegates, led by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative's director 
for Korean affairs, Gordana Earp, said South Korea must show sincere commitment 
in opening its market by Feb. 18, 1990, or incur stiff penalties under new U.S. 
trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
Washington accused Seoul in February of keeping its markets closed to American 
telecom products. It said it would slap up to 100% tariffs on 
telecommunications imports from South Korea if bilateral talks fell through.

'DO SOMETHING' ABOUT PENNY STOCK, CONVICTED STOCK SWINDLER URGES

A convicted stock swindler, wearing a hood to hide his features, urged Congress 
today to "do something now" to end what he called rampant fraud and organized 
crime control of the penny stock market, in which investors lose about $2 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The over-the-counter market is controlled by organized crime, the 
over-the-counter market is controlled by people like myself," Lorenzo Formato, 
the convicted stock manipulator, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee 
hearing on problems in the sale of cheaper penny stocks. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted that during the years he promoted and sold penny stocks, "I was 
involved in organized crime." He said that organized crime gave him protection 
and that he helped crime figures launder their money. 
</P>
<P>
"They needed me to be a money machine and that's just what I was -- a money 
machine," said Formato, a former auto mechanic. He said he became a stockbroker 
in 1973 after passing a state test, the answers to which he obtained illegally 
and memorized beforehand even though "I didn't know what a stock was" at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Investors lose $2 billion a year in penny stock swindles, two-thirds of all the 
money raised by venture capitalists in 1988, according to a report released by 
an organization of state securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the dirtiest businesses there is," Formato said. "Behind the 
suits and ties I know there are a lot of real nasty people."

SANCTIONS AGAINST JOHNSON'S COACH, DOCTOR PROMISED

The International Amateur Athletic Federation promised today to impose 
sanctions against the coach and doctor who administered Ben Johnson's steroid 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Federation President Primo Nebiolo said once the IAAF is in possession of the 
report from the Canadian government inquiry into drug use by athletes, punitive 
action will be taken against Coach Charlie Francis and Dr. Jamie Astaphan. 
</P>
<P>
The IAAF decided Tuesday to strip Johnson of his 100-meter world record set in 
Rome. Earlier, Johnson forfeited the gold medal he won at the Seoul Olympics 
after testing positive for a steroid. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Francis nor Astaphan have IAAF affiliation, but Ollan Cassel, an 
American member of the federation's 24-member general council, said the IAAF 
can impose sanctions to ensure that they are regarded as persona non grata by 
the track and field community.

JENNIFER CAPRIATI WAITING IN WINGS UNTIL SHE'S 14 AND GETS CHANCE TO EMULATE

One performer leaves the stage, and another moves into the wings. This show 
never ends. It just continues. Chris Evert walks off into the tennis sunset 
after losing to Zina Garrison at the U.S. Open, and Jennifer Capriati hangs 
around the practice court, rehearsing for the starring role. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati is a 13-year-old kid still trying to grow into her size 8 1/2 men's 
tennis sneakers. But she is Evert's living legacy, molded in her image, another 
two-fisted backhander with an oversized racket and oversized dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris is my idol," Capriati said, fondling a 14-karat gold bracelet Evert gave 
her at Christmas. On the front of the bracelet is the word "Jennifer." 
Inscribed on the back are the words, "Love Chris." 
</P>
<P>
Already, Capriati is wandering into the spotlight, holding news conferences, 
sitting with a group of American reporters while her father, Stefano, circles 
and listens. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati is a curiosity at the U.S. Open. Too young for the main draw, she is 
entered in the junior girls' tournament, the No. 3 seed who happens to be the 
French Open junior champion and the youngest member of the U.S. Wightman Cup 
Team. Wednesday, Capriati crushed 16-year-old Julie Shiflet of Virginia Beach, 
Va., 6-0, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even look at her age," Shiflet said. "I haven't been beaten like that 
in a long time. She could probably be a top 10 player on the women's tour now." 
</P>
<P>
Pam Shriver, No. 9 in the world, does not want to talk rankings and pile up 
more expectations but . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"She's the real McCoy," Shriver said. "She's going to be the next dominant 
American player." 
</P>
<P>
Evert's father, Jimmy, was Jennifer's first coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see her become the next Chrissie," he said. "She's an awfully good 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer can turn professional in March after celebrating her 14th birthday.
