MEXFLY ERADICATION APPEARS A SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although less costly and time-consuming than the battle against the 
Mediterranean fruit fly, the eradication campaign against the Mexican fruit fly 
in Southern California is quietly achieving the same apparent success, 
agriculture officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
With the final batch of sterile Mexflies being released in El Cajon today and 
in Compton soon after, and the quarantine of citrus set to expire next month, 
officials are optimistic that the Mexfly has been driven from the San Diego and 
Los Angeles areas. 
</P>
<P>
The odds are extremely slim that the tenacious citrus pest survived three doses 
of aerial malathion sprayings and the reproductive obstacle course of finding a 
fertile mate among the 360 million sterile flies released this summer, said 
Bill Routhier, San Diego area manager for the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is running perfectly, right on track," Routhier said. "We are very 
optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
The long-term forecast on the chances of reinfestation, however, is not as 
rosy, with federal funding likely to be slashed for fighting the Mexfly along 
the U.S.-Mexican border, where a sterile-fly "buffer zone" exists, and in Baja 
California, where U.S. and Mexican authorities are trying to squash the 
citrus-destroying insect. 
</P>
<P>
"It is ironic that we spend all this money on fighting the problem after it 
occurs and not more on prevention, which is always cheaper," Routhier said. "It 
is like fighting fires instead of preventing them." 
</P>
<P>
While some entomologists believe the Medfly is established in Southern 
California -- the latest infestation was spread through Los Angeles and Orange 
counties -- the Mexfly is not thought to have established itself on this side 
of the border, said John Worley, a member of the Mexfly Science Advisory Panel. 
</P>
<P>
Worley, also director of the Mexican Fruit Fly Rearing Facility in Mission, 
Tex., the supplier of sterile flies for eradication programs, said the Mexfly 
eradication program was bolstered by a plentiful supply of high-quality sterile 
flies. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the odds of the Mexfly returning to the Southland, another infestation 
could lead to more malathion applications by helicopter -- and trigger renewed 
public outcry against possible health hazards from the controversial pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
"We have continued to oppose malathion sprayings and we will keep fighting," 
said Sharon Taylor, pesticide reduction director for the Environmental Health 
Coalition, which was among the several environmental and public-interest 
organizations that organized opposition to the state sprayings this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the sprayings "human experimentation," Taylor said her group will 
continue to push for the release of public health studies on the effects of 
malathion on humans, as well as advocate pending legislation before Congress to 
ban aerial applications of the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
No wild Mexflies, pupae, larvae or eggs have been found in El Cajon since May 
5, when two egg-bearing females were trapped near the site where a male fly was 
discovered April 25, said Jose Aguiar, a Food and Agriculture inspector. 
</P>
<P>
In Compton, one wild fly has been trapped, on July 23, since an infestation was 
declared there this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Compton's final release of sterile flies is scheduled for Sept. 21, making a 
total of 360 million sterile flies that will have been unleashed over the 
16-square-mile infested zones in that city and in El Cajon since late June. 
</P>
<P>
The sterile flies are supposed to numerically overwhelm their wild brethren and 
mate them out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
The quarantines -- affecting 73 square miles in El Cajon and 81 square miles in 
Compton -- will be maintained until mid-October, when officials with the state 
agriculture department, the San Diego County Department of Agriculture, Weights 
and Measures and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are expected to conclude 
the eradication project. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture inspectors who have been checking fruit sold at wholesale, retail 
and other markets, as well as fruit trees at nurseries, have found only a few 
minor violations, Aguiar said. 
</P>
<P>
The quarantine, which requires citrus growers and sellers to take extra 
precautions to protect their fruit from the flies, has been an inconvenience, 
but county agriculture officials said they have not tallied the cost of those 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexfly project cost nearly $600,000 in state and federal funds as of July 
31, state agriculture officials said. No current cost estimate was available, 
but the final figure is expected to exceed several million dollars.

CITY REMAP PLAN IN DOUBT AFTER COUNCIL DISSENT; 
</P>
<P>
REDISTRICTING: COMPROMISE ON LAWSUIT OVER POLITICAL BOUNDARIES MAY BE HEADED 
FOR FAILURE NOW THAT THREE COUNCIL MEMBERS FEAR PROPOSAL MAY LEAD TO RACIAL 
STRIFE. 
</P>

<P>
A compromise settlement to the long-running San Diego City Council 
redistricting dispute over Latino voting rights teetered near collapse Thursday 
after three council members said new proposed boundaries in the South Bay could 
lead to racial strife. 
</P>
<P>
The reversal came one day after the parties in the class-action suit filed by 
the Chicano Federation of San Diego County Inc. appeared on the verge of 
settling the 1988 lawsuit, which has had more twists and turns than a carnival 
fun house. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposed settlement is formally rejected -- the City Council is 
scheduled to vote on the plan in closed session Tuesday -- preparations for 
what all sides say will be a long and expensive trial will move forward. The 
first step in that direction began late Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Subpoenas from Chicano Federation lawyers were to be issued to five council 
members and their staffs for production of various redistricting documents and 
appearances at sworn interrogations. 
</P>
<P>
The first such deposition is scheduled for next Wednesday morning, and the 
first witness is to be the secretary for Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt. By order 
of the court, the depositions will be conducted in public. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt is part of a five-member majority bloc that last week gave final 
approval to a redistricting map following weeks of bitter debate. The Chicano 
Federation opposed the map, which made the critical 8th District, stretching 
from downtown to San Ysidro, 51.9% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Among several objections, including the contention that the proposed new 
district unconstitutionally dilutes Latino voting rights and violates the terms 
of a previous settlement, the federation claims the five-member bloc met in 
private and agreed to endorse the map without any involvement from the public 
or the federation. 
</P>
<P>
One member of the bloc is Bob Filner, who represents the 8th District. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Chicano Federation attorney Michael Aguirre made a new 
proposal that called for changing district boundaries yet again to give 
District 8 nearly a 55% Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish that, two precincts totaling about 8,000 combined residents in 
the South Bay community of Nestor, the majority of them white, were transferred 
from the 8th District and placed in District 2, which is composed mainly of 
Point Loma and Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
To make the connection, the federation drew a line down San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
After weeks of acrimonious rhetoric, charges and countercharges, lawyers in the 
dispute Tuesday and Wednesday deliberately toned down their talk and said an 
accord was near, pending resolution of how much the city would pay Aguirre for 
his legal work on the federation's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
The first indication things were amiss again occurred during a hearing before 
U.S. District Judge John Rhoades on Thursday afternoon. The hearing -- attended 
by six lawyers representing the city and various individual council members -- 
was supposed to be a routine review of where settlement negotiations stood with 
U.S. Magistrate Harry McCue, who is handling the compromise discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us seem to be happy . . . so (that must mean) we're very close to 
settlement," Aguirre said. He told Rhoades that a settlement agreement would be 
presented in McCue's chambers later in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Chief Deputy City Atty. Jack Katz said the proposed settlement will be 
taken to the City Council for a vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But then attorney David Lundin, representing 8th District Filner, Bernhardt and 
Councilman John Hartley, spoke and said his clients didn't like the idea of 
dividing Nestor along "harsh racial lines," with Latinos on one side and whites 
on the other "going to Point Loma and Mission Hills." 
</P>
<P>
He told the judge he couldn't say whether his clients would approve the 
proposed settlement. Later in the day, after the compromise settlement appeared 
scuttled, Lundin told reporters that Filner, Hartley and Bernhardt will reject 
the plan Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades, who said he will leave in the middle of next week for a temporary 
assignment in another judicial district, responded by saying that 
"gerrymandering is American as apple pie" and that it is not wrong unless it 
violates the Constitution, the Voting Rights Act or some other law. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't (and) won't participate in where the lines are drawn," the judge said. 
"Where the lines go is a legislative decision, not a judicial decision." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney representing Councilman Bruce Henderson, who is not a member of 
the majority bloc, told the judge that other council members will disagree with 
the proposed settlement and that "very likely" it will not be approved. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, Pat McCormick, said the proposed map "creates havoc with the rest 
of the city." He has vowed to file a lawsuit contesting the City Council 
majority's redistricting plans. 
</P>
<P>
Another lawyer, representing Council Members Ron Roberts and Judy McCarty, said 
his clients had not participated in drafting the proposed new map and had not 
seen it. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the hearing, the attorneys hastily beat a path to McCue's 
chambers. Meanwhile, Filner, who attending the hearing, told reporters the 
proposed dividing of Nestor contains "the seeds" of potential racial strife and 
would be "extremely harmful to this city." 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is drawing a line across the South Bay . . . that says a 
side is Hispanic and (the other) one Anglo." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to support it. . . . I don't think the gain outweighs the loss." 
</P>
<P>
He said his office was flooded with calls Thursday from Nestor residents upset 
about the possibility of being divided and placed in a district they are 
neither geographically nor politically aligned with. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been completely misled by negotiations at this point," Aguirre said 
afterward. "Yesterday we were down to legal fees. Today it's a whole new ball 
game." 
</P>
<P>
"The council completely misled us," he said. "We think . . . the Latino 
community's best chance is with the integrity of Judge Rhoades . . . making 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Jess Haro, head of the Chicano Federation, said it was hypocritical and 
duplicitous of Filner to oppose the proposed compromise because of the 
potential racial strife it might engender. 
</P>
<P>
"He's only concerned about his own selfish reelection," Haro said. "He is the 
impediment, the biggest impediment to the Latino community's (effort) to 
redress 40 years of municipal history." 
</P>
<P>
Haro said that "Filner wants to keep the whites (in Nestor) because that 
improves his chances for reelection." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in an interview with reporters in his office, lawyer Lundin said his 
three City Council clients always had some problems with the proposed 
settlement map. 
</P>
<P>
Lundin said he told Filner, Bernhardt and Hartley on Wednesday -- when a 
compromise appeared at hand -- to "think about it overnight." On Thursday 
morning, the three told Lundin they wouldn't support the compromise because of 
the splitting of Nestor. 
</P>
<P>
Lundin said he and his clients have prepared yet another map that increases the 
Latino population in the 8th District without dividing the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, he said, would place the Latino population between the 51.9% 
approved last week by the council majority and the nearly 55% Aguirre said is 
contained in his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Lundin said he and Aguirre were supposed to talk about the new map Thursday 
afternoon, but that because of the developments in the courtroom, they never 
met. Lundin said he will attempt to talk to Aguirre about the new map.

REPORT DETAILING SAN ONOFRE PLANT FAILINGS SITS IDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One year after a 15-year, $46-million study found that the San Onofre Nuclear 
Generating Station is breaking federal law by killing off tons of fish and 
kelp, state regulatory agencies have taken no action on the findings, and 
environmentalists -- including one of the study's three authors -- are crying 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere along the line, justice is being delayed," said Rimmon C. Fay, a 
biologist who represented environmentalists' interests on the three-member 
Marine Review Committee, which released its study a year ago this week. "The 
present composition of the Coastal Commission is not one of great dedication 
toward the environment. The (state Regional Water Quality Control Board) has an 
outstanding record of neglect of enforcement of regulation. So nothing is being 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Richard (Corky) Wharton, an environmental lawyer who unsuccessfully challenged 
the nuclear plant's license a decade ago, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been one year and they have done absolutely nothing but set the hearings 
back again and again," said Wharton, now a professor at San Diego School of 
Law. "Nobody questions (that the study is) the most definitive report of its 
kind ever done. But there it is, and there it sits." 
</P>
<P>
The study, which was ordered by the California Coastal Commission, found that 
the nuclear plant had caused a 60%, or 200-acre, reduction in the area covered 
by the San Onofre kelp bed. It found that the plant's cooling system sucks up 
and kills 21 to 57 tons of fish yearly, then discharges the debris-filled water 
into the ocean, reducing natural light levels on the ocean floor by as much as 
16%. 
</P>
<P>
These "substantial" adverse effects -- while "not large-scale ecological 
disasters" -- violate the plant's federal pollutant-discharge permit, the study 
found. It recommended several ways to prevent or mitigate the damage, from 
upgrading the plant's cooling system to building an artificial reef. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the plant's operator, Southern California Edison, has not altered its 
operations, Edison officials confirmed. And spokesmen for the two state 
agencies that have the authority to force Edison to take action on the study's 
recommendations acknowledge that they have been slow to evaluate them, 
repeatedly postponing hearings in order to focus on other pressing issues. But 
they say overwork -- not oversight -- is to blame for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth of the matter is we haven't had staff to do it -- we should have a 
team of 10 scientists looking at this and we don't. We didn't have anybody 
working on it for a while," said Susan M. Hansch, manager of the energy and 
ocean resources unit of the Coastal Commission. "The commission is definitely 
not dragging their feet. It's the staff -- we haven't taken it to them. We 
couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
The Coastal Commission created the Marine Review Committee in 1974 as a 
condition of its granting Edison a construction permit to expand from one 
reactor to three. The committee's study, which was completely financed by 
Edison, was intended to provide an independent scientific review of the plant's 
impact by appointing one biologist for each special interest: Edison, the 
environmentalists and the Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Hansch said the commission is due to take up the study when it meets in San 
Diego in December. But that has led to the third postponement of a Water 
Quality Control Board hearing on the study; although the board is not required 
to by law, it has decided to wait for the Coastal Commission to evaluate the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling was the Coastal Commission initiated the study and completed the 
study and they should take a position on it," said John V. Foley, a board 
member and the general manager of the the Moulton Niguel Water District, which 
serves southern Orange County. "The real question is does the study really, 
truly document any violations. I don't think we want to do their work first. 
And we don't have a reason to believe anything yet." 
</P>
<P>
What that has meant, however, is that every time the Coastal Commission 
postpones action, so does the water board. Last December, two of Wharton's law 
students asked the board to revoke the plant's permit until Edison remedies the 
two reported permit violations. The board delayed taking action until April, 
then delayed it until August, and now has said it will wait until sometime in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a joke; we've had so many tentative dates scheduled and they've 
all been postponed," said Bruce Posthumus, a senior water resource control 
engineer for the board, adding that the board's tentative January hearing is 
designed to follow the Coastal Commission's December meeting. "That's a ways 
away. Between now and then, who knows what will happen? I wouldn't bet against 
it being postponed again." 
</P>
<P>
Edison spokesmen called the postponement "reasonable," but rejected their 
critics' contention that the company has exerted its influence to extend the 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this could be laid at our doorstep," said Michael Hertel, 
Edison's manager of environmental affairs. "It took (Fay) and his colleagues 13 
or 14 years to come up with the report, and it's obviously going to take the 
Coastal Commission some time to decide what should be done. To take a little 
bit of extra time on it to make sure they do the right thing is not only the 
prerogative but the duty of the commission." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, environmentalists say, the San Onofre kelp bed will pay the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as that plant operates in its present mode, on a cumulative basis 
things are going to grow worse," said Fay, who believes that even the final 
report to which he signed his name underestimates the extent of the damage. In 
order to get construction permits in 1974, Fay said, Edison "said, in effect, 
'If you provide us the evidence that something is wrong, we will do something 
about it.' But nothing has happened. Nothing. Not even token action. It is 
frustrating."

BONDS WOULD LET GARDENA HELP 1ST-TIME HOME BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First-time home buyers in Gardena who earn as much as $70,000 annually will be 
eligible to receive loans from the city under legislation passed last week by 
state lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, authored by state Sen. Ralph Dills (D-Gardena), authorizes the city 
to issue revenue bonds to raise money that would be lent to the home buyers 
with flexible payment schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena officials say the legislation, which was initially opposed by 
low-income housing advocates and still must be signed by the governor, will 
allow the city to assist middle-class residents who otherwise would be forced 
to buy in less expensive housing areas. 
</P>
<P>
"My God, it takes a small fortune to get in," Councilman Jim Cragin said, 
adding that his three sons were forced to purchase homes outside Gardena 
because they could not afford to buy within the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very conscious of that group of people who need homes and need 
to get their feet on the ground," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was approved by state senators on Friday. The next day, 
legislators voted to put a $325-million bond proposal on the November ballot to 
assist first-time home buyers and build low-cost housing statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The state measure would calculate income limits on a different basis than the 
Gardena program. Gardena officials say that, even if the proposal wins 
statewide approval, Dills' legislation will provide Gardena with complete 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our program and we'll call the shots," said Michael Wapner, the city's 
senior administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Dills' legislation initially would have applied to all cities statewide and was 
staunchly opposed by low-income housing advocates. The advocates contended the 
bill served a high-income group at a time when many cities have failed to make 
substantial progress in meeting their state-mandated goals for low-income 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
However, the advocates took a neutral position when Dills amended the bill to 
apply only to Gardena, which in recent years has taken steps to provide such 
housing. For example, in 1985 the city, in what was hailed as a unique move, 
issued revenue bonds to buy a mobile home park that was slated for demolition. 
The park's tenants, many of them low-income, were allowed to remain. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Ken Landau said the legislation was necessary because the income 
limits established previously by law would have precluded the city from selling 
bonds and lending the money to home buyers whose incomes exceeded roughly 
$47,000. 
</P>
<P>
Under the approved legislation, however, first-time Gardena home buyers whose 
incomes do not exceed 35% of the median purchase price of a home are eligible 
to receive a city loan. Because the median-priced home in Gardena is about 
$220,000, people whose household incomes range up to about $70,000 are 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Landau said details of the city's bond program have yet to be worked out, but 
the legislation requires the home buyer to provide a down payment of at least 
5%. Also, the buyer would have to qualify to meet the debt service on both the 
city loan and the remainder of the mortgage. A first-time home buyer is defined 
as anyone who has not owned a home during the previous three years. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also allows the city to delay a buyer's initial payments on the 
city loan for up to five years and specifies that the mortgage contract cannot 
exceed 40 years. The purchase price of homes cannot exceed the city's median 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Landau said Dills' legislation allows the city to lend up to 65% of the 
purchase price, but city officials intend to lend only up to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena officials say they do not know what interest rates borrowers might pay, 
but they are confident the rates will be below those offered by conventional 
banks or savings and loan institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city-backed bonds would be exempt from state taxes, they would be 
federally taxable. One longtime legislative analyst, who did not want to be 
identified, expressed doubts that the bonds would be attractive to 
institutional buyers because they are subject to federal tax. 
</P>
<P>
However, several city officials said they believe the bonds will be marketable, 
largely because of the city's excellent credit rating. 
</P>
<P>
Under the statewide proposal that will go before voters this fall, $200 million 
would be used to help first-time home buyers obtain second mortgages at 
low-interest rates. The state is authorized to issue loans with interest rates 
as low as 3% to home buyers who can come up with a down payment of 5%. The 
money from the state loan would be payable when the house is sold, refinanced 
or paid off. Although the proposal does not specify a maximum state loan 
amount, it is expected to be capped at $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Noteware, director of programs for the California Housing Finance Agency, 
which would administer the program, said first-time home buyers whose incomes 
do not exceed 35% of the average resale price of a home in the county in which 
they are buying would be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, where the average resale price is $171,000, the income 
of a household with one or two persons could not exceed $59,900, Noteware said. 
The price of the home could not be more than $171,000. 
</P>
<P>
Households with three or more people are allowed to purchase a home costing 10% 
more than the average resale price. In Los Angeles County, that means the price 
could go up to $188,100, Noteware said. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is this brings housing programs into the real world for high-cost 
areas like Los Angeles County," Noteware said.

BLACK JUROR TAKEN OFF PANEL AFTER OTHERS ALLEGE BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In an odd twist to an already complicated legal case, a Torrance Superior Court 
judge on Thursday called jurors into his chambers for interviews and then 
dismissed one of them after others on the panel said the man was biased. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John P. Shook replaced Harold Winston, 32, with an alternate juror after 
hearing two hours of testimony by Winston's fellow jurors. Nine of them said 
the Hawthorne man appeared to begin deliberations with a bias against police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
After he was removed, Winston vehemently denied the accusation, saying that 
jurors who disagreed with his point of view during deliberations misinterpreted 
statements he made and then conspired to have him removed from the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Winston, the only black juror on the panel, said he believes racism played a 
role in his removal. The defendant in the murder case, Charles Mack Moore, also 
is black and the case involves a raid and shooting by white Gardena police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gilbert Garcetti, who prosecuted the case with Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Irene Wakabayashi, argued during the trial that Moore was guilty of 
second-degree murder for allegedly pointing a shotgun toward Officer David 
Mathieson, provoking Mathieson to fire a shot that killed another man, Dexter 
Herbert. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Jeffrey Gray argued that Herbert, not Moore, was holding the 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
Winston said he was urging jurors to find Moore not guilty because of what he 
said was "incredibly flimsy evidence . . . that gave me a lot of reasonable 
doubt about whether Mack Moore had that gun." 
</P>
<P>
He said jurors initially voted 10 to 2 in favor of conviction, but that the 
vote was split 6 to 6 by the time deliberations were halted Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
He described his reaction to being removed as "a quiet rage." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel railroaded . . . insulted and degraded," he said. "I understand now how 
people feel when they go to court seeking justice and they get slapped in the 
face." 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Michael Wolfson, a specialist in litigation and trial practice at Loyola 
Law School, called the proceedings leading to Winston's removal "rather 
unique." 
</P>
<P>
"That's all pretty bizarre, because jury deliberations are this very sacred 
kind of secret rite protected in all sorts of ways," Wolfson said. "Jurors are 
supposed to do what they do without any basic scrutiny. A jury shouldn't be 
able to impeach itself." 
</P>
<P>
Winston said his problems may have arisen from a statement he made that other 
jurors misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
"I said that in black areas, the police are a little less respectful of life 
and they can have this cowboy, shoot-em-up attitude," Winston said. "That 
doesn't mean I think that of all officers or all situations." 
</P>
<P>
But juror Stanley Kielniarz, who was one of the first jurors to level charges 
of bias against Winston, told Shook during a hearing that Winston started off 
jury deliberations a week ago by saying that he does not trust anything a 
police officer says. 
</P>
<P>
"When we confronted him with his attitude and we said he should have divulged 
his prejudice about police officers (before becoming a juror on the case), he 
replied, 'They never asked me that question,' " Kielniarz said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to questions from the judge, Winston denied saying that he 
distrusts police officers and said he believed he could continue as a fair and 
impartial juror on the case. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview later, Winston said he has no bias for or against police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to have a lot of college classes with police officers, and I got to 
like some of them and not like others of them, just like you would anybody," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Kielniarz accused him at one point of favoring a not-guilty verdict 
purely because the defendant is black. 
</P>
<P>
"This (accusation) is racism in its ugliest form," Winston said. "Racism has 
been substituted for justice here in Torrance." 
</P>
<P>
Deliberations in the case were halted Wednesday after the jury passed a note to 
the court saying that they could not reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Shook, who presided over the case but then left on vacation shortly after the 
jury began deliberating, asked Judge Jean Matusinka to fill in for him. 
</P>
<P>
When Matusinka asked the jury whether anything could be done to help them reach 
a verdict, several jurors complained that one member of the panel was 
inflexible. 
</P>
<P>
During that hearing, Kielniarz revealed that he went to the district attorney's 
office during Wednesday's lunch hour to ask what to do if a juror made 
statements revealing bias. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's investigator who responded to his query testified in a 
hearing that he never discussed specifics of the case with Kielniarz and that 
he advised him to have the jury foreman talk to the attorneys in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Gray protested that Kielniarz revealed an inherent bias by 
going to the district attorney's office with his questions rather than asking 
for help from the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Because specifics of the case were not discussed, however, Matusinka ruled that 
Kielniarz had not been tainted as a juror by talking to the investigator. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Shook cut short his vacation and returned to court to decide 
whether Winston should be allowed to remain on the jury. 
</P>
<P>
"It's apparent to me that Mr. Winston has prejudged the credibility of the 
police officers in this case," Shook said as he issued his ruling. "He is 
unable to cast aside his personal bias in weighing the evidence in the case." 
</P>
<P>
Gray blasted the judge's decision as "the biggest miscarriage of justice that I 
have seen in 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
"The message to the jury is clear: If there is a majority of jurors who 
disagree with a minority, all you have to do is run to the judge and say, 'This 
guy disagrees with us. Remove him,' " he said. "If a verdict comes in, it's 
clear it will be a coerced verdict."

<P>
REAL HEART ATTACK OCCURS DURING CPR CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When Cora Manor began moaning and clutching at her chest during an American Red 
Cross first-aid class Tuesday, some fellow students momentarily wondered if she 
was feigning symptoms as part of the course. 
</P>
<P>
"My first instinct was that they'd planted her in the class to see how we'd 
react," said Glenn Emerson of Torrance, who was seated next to Manor. 
</P>
<P>
But the students and their instructor quickly recognized that Manor was 
seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
"She went, 'The pain! The pain!' and I realized something was wrong," said 
Bonny La Monica, a registered nurse and the volunteer instructor of the class 
at the Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Manor, 56, of Carson, had suffered a heart attack from a ruptured aneurysm in 
her aorta. Her doctor said Thursday that quick action by the class in 
recognizing the seriousness of her symptoms helped save her life. 
</P>
<P>
At first, La Monica said, she thought Manor was hyperventilating or 
experiencing a muscle spasm, but soon she realized it was more than that. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to get her to listen to my voice and breathe slowly," La Monica said. 
"She was kind of fading in and out for a while." 
</P>
<P>
La Monica took Manor's pulse and others took her blood pressure. The instructor 
said she decided to call for an ambulance "when I could see she was not 
responding, and her consciousness level was going down." 
</P>
<P>
"She was just blessed at being at the right place at the right time," said 
Manor's daughter, Theresa Guidroz. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the class was learning cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, a 
method of external heart massage. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people with ruptured aneurysms like that don't make it," said Dr. Ramon 
Cukingnan, a cardiac surgeon who operated on Manor on Tuesday night at Little 
Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance. Manor remained in the hospital's cardiac 
surgical unit Thursday evening, her condition listed as critical. 
</P>
<P>
"If this had happened at home, if there was nobody at home or some 
inexperienced people, there would have been a little bit of delay," Cukingnan 
said, and getting immediate medical attention is critical in such cases. 
Training people to recognize symptoms and respond quickly "is why we all feel 
the CPR course is a very good course for lay people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Manor was taking the class to update the CPR certification required of foster 
parents, said her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
CPR training was part of the eight-hour, two-session course held Tuesday and 
Thursday at the storefront Red Cross office at the Del Amo mall. 
</P>
<P>
La Monica, of Redondo Beach, said that she has dealt with a number of heart 
attacks in her 28 years of nursing and that a heart aneurysm killed her mother 
eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
La Monica said she normally finishes a first-aid class by telling her students: 
"Now you have this information, but I hope you don't ever have to use it." 
</P>
<P>
But this time, she told them: "I hope you never have to use this again."

IT'S ANCHORS AWEIGH FROM L.A. TO THE GULF WITH CARGO FOR MARINES; 
</P>
<P>
MIDDLE EAST: THE CAPE BORDA AND FOUR OTHER VESSELS WILL CARRY MILITARY 
EQUIPMENT TO BE USED BY 1ST MARINE BRIGADE IN SAUDI ARABIA.

<P>
The first of five huge cargo vessels slated to carry tons of military equipment 
from the Port of Los Angeles to the Persian Gulf is being loaded and will sail 
within days, military officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 515-foot Cape Borda is capable of carrying up to 20 million pounds of 
supplies and heavy equipment including tanks, personnel carriers and 
155-millimeter howitzers. The so-called break-bulk ship is designed so that 
cargo can be lifted to and from its deck with giant on-board cranes. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the Oakland-based vessel and four others not yet in the port will 
carry enough cargo to support the deployment of the 1st Marine Expeditionary 
Brigade to Saudi Arabia. The 15,000-Marine brigade from Kaneohe, Hawaii, is 
scheduled to leave within a week, joining two Marine brigades already in Saudi 
Arabia, military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
When all five vessels arrive in the Middle East, they will carry enough 
military equipment to sustain the 1st Brigade for 30 days of combat, officials 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the merchant vessels Cape Ducato and Meteor were the first 
cargo ships to leave the harbor for the Persian Gulf as part of the Navy's 
Military Sealift Command. But those ships left the port without cargo, heading 
first for Beaumont, Tex., one of the nation's busiest military seaports since 
the Middle East crisis began. The Cape Ducato picked up military supplies there 
and is steaming to the Persian Gulf. The Meteor is en route to Beaumont. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Meteor and Cape Ducato, the Cape Borda is part of the U.S. Maritime 
Administration's Ready Reserve Force of ships available to the Navy on as 
little as five days' notice. The Cape Borda, built in 1967 in Avondale, La., 
has been part of the reserve force -- operated by the Maritime Administration 
-- for five years. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment of Cape Ducato and four other cargo ships chartered from private 
companies has been planned for some time as part of the Military Sealift 
Command's role in the Middle East operation known as Desert Shield, military 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just part of the natural progression of deployment for the operation," 
said Marge Holtz, director of public information for the command. Holtz 
declined to say when the Cape Borda would depart the harbor. Likewise, she 
refused to name the other four ships that are scheduled within days to arrive 
in the port to pick up cargo. 
</P>
<P>
She did, however, say the other vessels slated to pick up military cargo in the 
harbor will not be part of the ready reserve force. Instead, she said, the 
vessels will be chartered from private companies for the military operation. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Marine Lt. Col. Stuart Wagner said the deployment of the 
cargo vessels has been long anticipated and was vital to supply the 1st Brigade 
as soon as possible after its arrival in Saudi Arabia.

OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT GREETS VANDAL VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts in crime and prejudice Thursday night urged neighbors of Szebelski and 
Matilda Freeman, the black Agoura couple whose house was vandalized last month 
in an apparent racial attack, to prevent similar incidents by watching out for 
each other and confronting bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
An overflow crowd of 50 civic leaders and residents of Saratoga Ranch, a 
predominantly upper middle-class subdivision west of the San Fernando Valley, 
attended a meeting near the Freemans' residence, which was the target of an 
apparent hate crime Aug. 29 for the second time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"When the community comes together like this and not only expresses outrage but 
bands together to watch out for one another, it can prevent this kind of thing 
from happening again," said Mary Krasn, an assistant director of the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which organized the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"If neighbors come out, it can show support and make them less vulnerable to 
this kind of attack," Krasn said. The meeting drew a larger than expected 
crowd, forcing the group to move outside from a neighbor's living room. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated $30,000 damage was caused by the intruders, who slashed chairs, 
overturned kitchen appliances and spray-painted swastikas and racial epithets 
at the residence of the retired real-estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made and investigators have no leads in the case, Los 
Angeles County sheriff's Detective Imon Mills said earlier Thursday. The case 
was referred this week for investigation to the Los Angeles County Human 
Relations Commission by Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
There was a similar incident at the Freeman residence in October, 1987, in 
which property was damaged and racial epithets were spray-painted, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
In yet another incident July 2, the Agoura Hills residence of a family of 
Middle Eastern descent was broken into and vandalized, its walls spray-painted 
with illegible writing. That attack, Mills said Thursday, appeared to be 
unrelated to the Freeman case. 
</P>
<P>
"I came because I was so offended by it and I felt it was necessary to stand up 
and show support," Roni Birkner of Agoura said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman told the crowd of supporters that he would neither leave the 
neighborhood nor change his lifestyle. "Being free has a price to pay," he 
said, referring to his surname. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. David Hunting of Agoura Community Church brought the Freemans a 
condolence card signed by members of his congregation. And Rabbi Alan Greenbaum 
of Temple Adat Elohim in Thousand Oaks came to represent the Jewish community 
because "it doesn't matter if the focus of the hatred is a black family or a 
Jewish family or an Asian family, the statement of anger ultimately is to all 
of us so we need to respond to that as a community." 
</P>
<P>
Matilda Freeman said before the meeting that her family's anguish over the 
attack had been eased by an outpouring of community support, including help 
with cleaning up their house and the establishment of a reward fund, which 
contains $3,000. The reward is for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of the vandals.

SAN FERNANDO CITY WORKERS STUDY OPTIONS AS TALKS STALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Members of the San Fernando city employees' union will consider actions ranging 
from a work slowdown to a strike in protest against the city over wages and 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The council on Tuesday rejected a two-year contract offer from the union as 
well as a counteroffer made by city negotiators. Instead, the council voted to 
implement a one-year salary and benefit package that gives union members 3.7% 
more than the city paid last year. The city had proposed a 13.4% compensation 
increase over two years. The union had proposed an 18% increase. 
</P>
<P>
The council also refused to send both sides back to the bargaining table 
because they had declared an impasse in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The union's contract, which affects 60 employees, expired June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The one-year employment policy, which is not a legally binding agreement, 
leaves the contract in limbo until March, 1991, when the next round of contract 
talks is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Mary Strenn said that although city officials are concerned 
that employees might stage a work slowdown or strike, "we are fully expecting 
that they will serve the public as they have in the past without a beat." 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said employees would limit their work to required tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not going to do what they have always done," said Bill Shawhan, 
general manager of the California League of City Employees Local 690. "They are 
going to do exactly what they need to do to get their pay. They're not going to 
do anything extra." 
</P>
<P>
Shawhan said that at a union meeting on Sept. 12, members would discuss work 
slowdowns, demonstrations, political lobbying, public relations efforts and the 
possibility of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
Also at Tuesday's meeting, the council approved the appointment of Salvador 
Ponce, 52, to replace former Councilman Jess Margarito, who resigned Aug. 10 to 
apply for the job of San Fernando Community Services director. Ponce, who will 
be sworn in Sept. 17, has served on city committees in the past and is a 
prominent community leader, Strenn said. 
</P>
<P>
Margarito was appointed to his new post the same day Ponce was approved as a 
council member, Strenn said.

Portuguese Bend affair is not joust another horse show. 
</P>
<P>
Elegant English-style horseback riders wearing breeches and shiny boots will 
rub shoulders with jousting medieval knights in Rolling Hills Estates on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
It's not quite what one expects at a classic horse show, but it's all a part of 
the weekend's entertainment as the 33rd annual Portuguese Bend National Horse 
Show unfolds at the Empty Saddle Club today through Sunday. The event is the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula's major fund-raiser for Childrens Hospital of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In competition that carries a top rating from the American Horse Show Assn., 
riders from preteen to adults will vie for honors in horsemanship ranging from 
jumping for speed and height to striving for perfect form as they take their 
horses over fences or guide them through the walk, trot and canter. 
</P>
<P>
Leading a lineup of weekend entertainment, knights from Medieval Times in Buena 
Park, wearing full armor and bright colors, will joust early Saturday 
afternoon. Among Sunday's attractions will be precision riding by the 50-member 
Long Beach Mounted Police unit on palominos and gymnastics performed on moving 
horses by youngsters from the Rainbow Vaulters. 
</P>
<P>
Show organizers say this mixture of keenly competitive horsemanship and 
colorful equestrian entertainment is designed to please both horse experts and 
casual spectators. 
</P>
<P>
"We're bringing very fine quality horses and fine quality riders," show 
chairman Jody Murdock said. "Everyone, whether they're knowledgeable about 
horses or not, will have entertaining events they can enjoy seeing." 
</P>
<P>
Murdock said some of the most exciting riding of the weekend will be provided 
by youngsters competing in the Horsemanship Medal Finals of the Pacific Coast 
Horse Shows Assn. Focused on riding skills in the walk, trot and canter as well 
as jumping, the event is open to children 14 and younger who have won blue 
ribbons at other horse shows in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The top young riders in the state are coming from Sacramento to San Diego," 
said Carole Diestel, president of the peninsula support committee for Childrens 
Hospital. She said 55 youngsters have qualified for the event. 
</P>
<P>
Devotees of fast riding over jumps will be able to get their thrills in 
Gambler's Choice, in which horses and riders must clear up to 12 fences in a 
specified period of time. Points are based on the difficulty of the jump. 
</P>
<P>
And at the opposite end of the equestrian spectrum, an event called Leadline 
will spotlight children under the age of 8. "We dress them up, put them on the 
back of a horse and lead them in. It's their introduction to the horse, and 
many parents regret that later on," said Murdock in a joking reference to the 
time and expense a horse can entail. 
</P>
<P>
A special demonstration of horsemanship will be given by youngsters from the 
Pony Club of Portuguese Bend, where South Bay children care for horses and take 
riding lessons. 
</P>
<P>
And in one of the more unusual events at the show, people will be able to see 
Peruvian Pasos in action. These small horses have been bred for centuries to 
carry their heads high and move rapidly, without bouncing, in a kind of 
scurrying motion. 
</P>
<P>
If youngsters feel a need for a little distraction from horses during the show, 
they may visit the Kids Korral, where the attractions will include the Jim 
Gamble Marionettes and Willie the Clown, along with pony rides, face painting, 
crafts, games and contests. 
</P>
<P>
The horse show -- which takes its name from its one-time home at the historic 
Vanderlip stables in Portuguese Bend -- has grown over the years. A decade ago, 
about 2,000 people attended the show, but this weekend, the number is expected 
to range between 3,000 and 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Church and school parking lots in the Empty Saddle area will be used to 
accommodate cars, with shuttle buses going to and from the riding club between 
9 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Diestel said several donors cover the show's costs, permitting low food and 
admission prices and larger proceeds for the hospital. Last year, a total of 
$156,000 was raised. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 volunteers are the backbone of the show, including the 40 active 
members of the hospital support committee and their families. Volunteers put up 
the blue and white striped tents that serve as booths. They spread and rake the 
sawdust for the show rings. During the show, they will cook and sell hamburgers 
and hot dogs, along with cold drinks, coffee, salad and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Two weekends ago, volunteer workers descended on the Empty Saddle Club, where 
they made repairs and painted fences white and trash cans green. 
</P>
<P>
"We need it to look real great for our show," said Ann Boyt, a show co-chair, 
adding that the show is a "tremendous effort" on the part of everyone who 
pitches in.

HEARTLESS OR HEARTSICK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York is supposed to be the ultimate example of the impersonal, hard-hearted 
big city, the place where pedestrians hustle past the homeless, and screams for 
help are met with shut windows. 
</P>
<P>
But New York's anguished reaction to a recent spate of shooting deaths of 
children is healthier, and more humane, than the numbed -- and some would even 
say blase -- reaction Southern California has shown to the relentless drive-by 
murders of children here for the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
Various excuses are put forth for Southern California's muted response. 
</P>
<P>
1. We are geographically separated. Does that assume a commuter who drives 40 
miles from Costa Mesa to downtown Los Angeles is supposed to care less about a 
child shot a few miles from his job than one killed a few miles from his home? 
</P>
<P>
2. Southern California lacks the screaming headlines of tabloid newspapers. 
True, but what we lack in tabloids we more than make up for in local television 
news. 
</P>
<P>
3. New York had a concentration of four murders in a short time to spark the 
city's fury. A roundup of weekend crime stories in Southern California 
typically reports at least three gang-related shootings. Quite a few result in 
the deaths of children. 
</P>
<P>
Genuine widespread outrage about gang-related violence hit Los Angeles once -- 
when a young professional woman was the victim of a bullet in Westwood. But 
most victims of gang-related violence aren't professionals -- and don't die in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
And now it looks as if we're running out of excuses.

THE SOONER THE BETTER;

OKLAHOMA TURNING ON THE CHARM FOR CALIFORNIA COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California is not alone in its appreciation of what high housing 
prices, increasing congestion and high taxes can mean for the economic 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
While various states and even foreign nations have found fertile ground in 
California for recruiting businesses that seek to move to less expensive 
locales, Oklahoma has become the first state to open a full-time economic 
development office in this region. Gov. Henry L. Bellmon even showed up in 
Orange County this week to make the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
That's pretty ironic when you remember that in the 1930s, Depression-era 
frustration drove thousands of migrant workers to Southern California from the 
Dust Bowl and provided inspiration for John Steinbeck. Today, far different 
economic conditions are prompting the opportunistic Sooners to entice 
businesses their way. 
</P>
<P>
The pot of gold in Oklahoma's rainbow is cheaper housing, lower corporate and 
personal income tax rates and less traffic. One Newport Beach oil services firm 
has already moved. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lesson here for Southern California, which has prospered as a 
promised land for generations -- from Oklahoma and elsewhere. Today the work 
that needs doing is not just to create new jobs but to make the area livable 
and affordable. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and Orange counties both had annual rates of growth in new 
employment of less than 2% last year. But Orange County, which enjoyed growth 
in the 6%-to-8% range during the late 1980s, has no economic development 
program. And while the city of Los Angeles has such a program, many people 
still can't get their share of the good life. UCLA professor James Johnson says 
that many discouraged black residents simply move away. 
</P>
<P>
Census figures do show people are still flocking to Southern California despite 
our problems. But the area also needs some comprehensive strategies. Otherwise, 
more California businesses may start whistling Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes.

As somebody who lived under Hitler, it amazes me to hear serious people suggest 
that the President was dead wrong in sending troops to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Assume for a moment that Congress had followed President Wilson into the League 
of Nations, and that George Bush had been President in April, 1939, when Hitler 
marched into Czechoslovakia. He would have sent troops into Poland, the obvious 
next target on Hitler's list and spurred the League of Nations into action and 
World War II would not have taken place.

a bachelor of science degree in mathematical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to California in 1938 and settled in Glendale, where he lived until 
his death. He was hired as a design engineer by Lockheed in Burbank in 1938, 
working there until his retirement in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Fancher was a longtime member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Herminia; his son and three 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
At his request, there will be no funeral services. Burial will be at Forest 
Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale. Aftercare California Cremation and Burial 
Society is handling the arrangements.

BIOETHICS INSTITUTE FOUNDER, SCHOLAR DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE STASSEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alyce Stanley Vrolyk, who was the founding director of the Bioethics Institute 
at Northridge Hospital Medical Center and a former Cal State Northridge 
professor, has died in Northridge. She was 61. 
</P>
<P>
The institute, which addresses medical ethical issues, will be renamed the 
Alyce S. Vrolyk Bioethics Institute in her honor at a memorial service 
scheduled for 6 p.m. Monday at the hospital, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime Northridge resident, Mrs. Vrolyk died Sunday after a six-year battle 
with cancer, her daughter, Anne Vrolyk, said. 
</P>
<P>
Born Alyce Stanley on Sept. 10, 1928, in Los Angeles, she graduated from 
Westlake School for Girls in Los Angeles. She received a bachelor's degree, 
master's degree and a doctorate in philosophy from UCLA and taught a variety of 
philosophy classes at CSUN from the fall of 1975 to the fall of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Mrs. Vrolyk, along with Dr. Leo Rain and Dr. Carol Katz, founded the 
Bioethics Institute at the hospital to address ethical issues related to the 
medical field, such as euthanasia, organ transplant and in-vitro fertilization, 
said Dave Jakway, senior vice president of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"She had the ability to stimulate people to think in terms beyond their 
biases," Jakway said. 
</P>
<P>
Four days before her death, she resigned her position as director of the 
Bioethical Institute, Jakway said. 
</P>
<P>
She was a member of several organizations, including the Los Angeles County Bar 
Assn.'s Bioethics Committee, the American Philosophical Assn., the American 
Psychological Assn., the Hastings Center in New York and the Los Angeles Yacht 
Club. Mrs. Vrolyk lectured nationwide and served as a consultant to several 
Southern California hospitals that were establishing bioethics programs. 
</P>
<P>
A wine connoisseur, Mrs. Vrolyk in 1980 co-founded The Wine Workshop, a company 
that sponsored wine-tasting classes. She was also secretary of the Society of 
Wine Educators from 1984 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her husband of 40 years, John Vrolyk; sons Beau Vrolyk of 
Hillsborough, Calif., and Tom Vrolyk of San Francisco; daughter Anne Vrolyk of 
San Francisco; sister Ann Westvig of Oceanside; and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
At her request, a funeral service will not be held and her body will be donated 
for medical research, family members said. Aftercare California Cremation and 
Burial Society in Van Nuys is handling the arrangements. Donations can be made 
to an endowment in Mrs. Vrolyk's name at the Bioethics Institute at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center.

LATINO OFFICIALS' 'FIGHT FOR THE SPOILS'

<TEXT>
<P>
Acuna's long article regarding the historic Los Angeles County redistricting 
case contained a reference to a recent recall against our councilman, Richard 
Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
There's just not much to it. 
</P>
<P>
Acuna probably didn't have time to learn that the effort is an oddly timed, 
strange and mean-spirited attack by a few people who seem to have political 
aspirations themselves. But those of us who work daily in the community, 
particularly with its youth, know that it's Richard Alatorre who rolls up his 
sleeves to help and be of service, not the people with loud voices and selfish 
interests.

EL TORO AS REMEDY FOR AIRPORT LOGJAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all the press given to turning George AFB into a major commercial airport 
(Col. One, Aug. 26) complete with high-speed rail links, it makes me wonder if 
there isn't a better near-term use for this site. Why doesn't the Pentagon 
relocate the Marines from El Toro MCAS to George AFB? This would keep George a 
military air base for which it was designed and allow El Toro to be used as 
Orange County's much-needed, Los Angeles-reliever airport. 
</P>
<P>
George AFB is much larger than El Toro, is far closer to the Marine Corps 
facilities at Twenty-Nine Palms and Fort Irwin, and is still only 65 air miles 
from El Toro if close proximity to Camp Pendleton is a must. 
</P>
<P>
Using George AFB as a commercial airport may make sense for the year 2000 and 
beyond. However, using El Toro MCAS as Orange County's commercial airport makes 
sense now.

MAKE SCHOOLS A BRIDGE TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN GOODMAN, Ellen Goodman is a syndicated columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It often seems that we have subdivided and subcontracted life. We go to two 
employers for our money, one or two schools for our education, a Burger King or 
Pizza Hut for dinner. As Ralph Nader said without too much exaggeration in the 
recent Utne Reader, "At this time in American history, corporations are more 
important in raising children than parents . . . Who's raising the kids? 
Kindercare is raising them. McDonald's is feeding them. HBO and Disneyland are 
entertaining them." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike our farming ancestors, or even the grandparents who ran small shops, 
today's husbands, wives and children spend most days under separate roofs. Even 
dinner hour sometimes seems to have disintegrated into individual servings, and 
weekends are usurped by errands. 
</P>
<P>
So, it is no wonder that some regard schools as another institution of our 
split lives, a replacement for family. We are often ambivalent asking the 
schools to take over any more -- to serve breakfast as well as lunch, to teach 
ethics as well as English. To add hours and days to their schedule and subtract 
them from our own. 
</P>
<P>
For every analyst who thought that a longer school day provided a balance beam 
across the great divide of family and work, there was another who thought it 
led in the wrong direction. For everyone who thought a longer year would help, 
there was another who thought it would cloud the real needs of children. 
</P>
<P>
This is part of a much deeper debate about the direction of change, about work 
and families, institutions and human values. This debate underscores much of 
what passes for "policy" discussions. But in this early September light, I 
remain focused on the immediate -- the need to alter the school calendar and 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence, after all, that today's limited school schedule has made 
the work world adjust to family needs. Nor is there any reason to believe that 
a changed schedule would slow progress toward that goal. What we have right 
now, in most places, is parents who work and kids who wander. 
</P>
<P>
A voluntary after-school program -- as many communities can attest -- wouldn't 
take children away from families, but from the streets or from the television 
set. At their best, such programs enrich a child's life. At a minimum, they 
offer security. 
</P>
<P>
This week, when class is out, millions of working parents face their daily pop 
quiz: "It's 4:00. Do you know where your children are?" Schools can fill in the 
blank.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER GETS PROBATION OVER HIT-AND-RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 72-year-old woman motorist, convicted of felony hit-and-run after she struck 
another elderly woman in a crosswalk because the woman wasn't walking fast 
enough, was sentenced Thursday to three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Miriam Krissman of Van Nuys, was also fined $500 by Van Nuys 
Superior Court Judge James M. Coleman and ordered to perform 500 hours of 
community service for the hit-and-run accident that injured Velma Shows, 69, of 
Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Krissman was convicted by a jury July 27 after an earlier trial resulted in a 
hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
Shows testified that she was walking in a crosswalk at Sherman Way and Etiwanda 
Avenue the afternoon of Sept. 14, 1988, when she heard someone say, "Hurry up, 
hurry up. Get out of my way." Shows said Krissman's car then did a U-turn in 
the intersection and knocked her down. 
</P>
<P>
Shows suffered a broken leg, which required surgery, Deputy Dist. Atty. Terese 
M. Hutchison said. 
</P>
<P>
A witness provided Los Angeles police with five of the six numbers and letters 
in the license plate of Krissman's car. The damaged car was traced to Krissman, 
who told police that it had struck a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Krissman's attorney, Charles English, contended that Krissman was not in the 
area and was not involved in the accident.

MOSCOW HAS VALUE AS A BRIDGE TO BAGHDAD, AND BUSH NEEDS GORBACHEV'S COOPERATION

By ILANA KASS, Ilana Kass is professor of national security policy,

<TEXT>
<P>
The Sunday summit in Helsinki is both a symbol of the new superpowers 
relationship and its first serious test. So far, the Persian Gulf crisis has 
seen the United States and the Soviet Union acting in concert, pursuing 
different but overlapping goals. The Bush-Gorbachev meeting will show how much 
their differences limit their cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The superpowers need each other to achieve their regional goals. Without at 
least tacit Soviet support, the United States cannot isolate Iraq, deter 
further aggression and compel Saddam Hussein to restore the status quo in 
Kuwait. The image of "Saddam against the world" -- key to U.S. policy -- can be 
advanced only with Soviet cooperation. For the Soviets, such collaboration 
could secure what 30 years of costly involvement in the Middle East did not: 
the role of coequal. 
</P>
<P>
But continued Soviet cooperation should not be taken for granted. The 
superpowers' interests are mutually supportive; they are not identical. To 
avoid surprise and costly mistakes, Soviet goals must be factored into the U.S. 
strategy at the summit and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
First, it is worth noting that the Soviets had little choice but to condemn 
Iraq. The invasion and annexation destroyed a growing relationship with Kuwait 
from which Moscow intended to draw significant dividends. It also, as one 
Soviet spokesman noted, "gave the United States a pretext to get both feet 
firmly planted in the gulf, thus securing for itself enduring presence and 
influence in this strategic region" -- a change in the balance of power that is 
clearly not beneficial to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
A keen sense of strategic priorities determines Moscow's stand. On the global 
chessboard, the relationship with the West is dominant; Iraq is merely a pawn. 
The economic, political and military benefits accruing to Moscow from its 
alliance with Baghdad are dwarfed by the expected advantages of siding with the 
West and such key Arab nations as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria. As Pravda 
succinctly put it: "Saddam Hussein owes Moscow $20 billion, but the Soviet 
Union could obtain considerably more from the West." 
</P>
<P>
Money is not the only consideration. The Soviets expect other tangible rewards, 
from relaxed technology transfers to arms-control concessions. This "linkage" 
is likely to be raised at the summit. If so, the Soviets will be reminded that 
supporting international sanctions against Iraq was not only the right thing to 
do; it was also in their interest. 
</P>
<P>
The economic calculus is anything but clear-cut. As the world's largest oil 
producer, the Soviet Union can expect an initial windfall from soaring oil 
prices, even if export quotas remain unchanged. According to one Soviet 
analysis, "at $30 a barrel, the Soviet Union would increase its oil revenue by 
$7.25 billion -- the equivalent of its entire trade deficit for 1989." A 
similar jump in the price of gold -- at 300 tons a year, another key export -- 
could also bring a handsome profit and a much-needed economic boost. But an 
oil-driven recession in the West is hardly in Moscow's long-term interest. To 
quote Pravda: "The Soviet Union does not want the collapse of Western 
economies, as it is trying to obtain economic assistance from them." 
</P>
<P>
At the summit, both superpowers will need to reconcile these conflicting 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Desert Shield requires an even more complex balancing act. The 
Soviets do not want to see the United States firmly entrenched -- or bogged 
down -- in the Persian Gulf. To put their house in order, they need a stable 
international environment, reduced Western defense spending and ready access to 
international credits, investment and technology. War in the Persian Gulf would 
diminish these prospects, forcing the Soviets to make some hard choices. Hence 
Moscow's preference for a diplomatic solution, particularly one allowing it to 
share the glory but avoid blame. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet bid for a political settlement might be forthcoming. Soviet 
commentators maintain that a permanent channel of communication, consultation 
and even influence with Iraq remains open. They say that the Soviet Union 
"enjoys authority with all sides to the conflict, retains the Iraqi 
leadership's trust, and has a solid experience of contacts with all regional 
players. This guarantees that any Soviet initiative will be favorably 
received." If so, the Soviets might be in a position to help Hussein back off 
from the brink -- provided he is ready. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of Soviet military advisers in Iraq should be viewed in a similar 
light. Western analysts have asserted that the advisers remain against 
Gorbachev's better judgment and only because troglodytes are circumventing 
official policy. That is nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
The very nature of Soviet politics leaves little room for rogue operations. 
Most important, removing the advisers from Iraq may not be in the West's best 
interest. The 193 acknowledged "military specialists" are unlikely to have a 
significant operational impact, even if hostilities were to break out. 
Conversely, the advisers -- and thousands of Soviet-educated Iraqi officers -- 
could serve as an important bridge to the Iraqi military, both for now and with 
an eye to a post-Hussein regime. This could be the dowry the Soviets bring to 
Helsinki.

POWER PLANT CRITICS BLAST MEETING SET ON HOLY DAY; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: BUT UCLA WON'T AGREE TO A DELAY, SAYING THE PROJECT IS URGENTLY NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Opponents of a proposed power plant for the UCLA campus are urging the 
University of California regents to reschedule their September meeting now set 
for the Jewish high holy day of Rosh Hashanah so that community members who are 
Jewish may be heard. 
</P>
<P>
Alternately, members of community groups have called upon UCLA to voluntarily 
withdraw the matter from the Sept. 20-21 meeting agenda out of sensitivity to 
the community. The meeting will be held at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Despite lobbying by state elected officials and two major Jewish organizations, 
the Board of Regents and UCLA have so far refused to change the meeting date or 
postpone consideration of the giant "chiller-cogenerator." 
</P>
<P>
Allen Solomon, UCLA vice chancellor for administration, said the university is 
not willing to delay the matter because of the urgent need to move the proposed 
project forward. It was delayed in July in part to allow community input, he 
said, adding, "This plant will be built." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the November regents meeting is set for San Francisco, which also 
would diminish participation by Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
However, Laura Lake, representing Friends of Westwood and UCLA Watch, said it 
will be far easier to get Jewish opponents of the plant to fly to San Francisco 
than it will be to get them to a hearing on the high holy day. 
</P>
<P>
Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year, which begins at sundown on Sept. 19 and 
continues until sunset Sept. 21. It is marked by daylong religious ceremonies 
and many Jews abstain from work and other secular activities. 
</P>
<P>
University officials say the plant, to be fueled by natural gas and landfill 
gas, is urgently needed to provide energy for the campus. Opponents of the 
project are concerned about its size, the pollution it would generate and its 
125-foot smokestacks. 
</P>
<P>
They also allege that UCLA is in a hurry to avoid new air quality guidelines 
that will go into effect soon after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's position is that it should not be held responsible for a meeting set by 
the regents, however unfortunate the timing. Carlotta Mellon, assistant vice 
chancellor for community and governmental relations, said UCLA officials are 
"very regretful that the meeting has to occur on Rosh Hashanah. We try to be 
sensitive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Solomon, "There are opportunities for people who are not going to 
testify in person (because they) . . . to have someone read their statements 
into the record." 
</P>
<P>
But state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica) do not agree that the meeting must be held on the Jewish New 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
"They should not be meeting on Rosh Hashanah," Rosenthal said in a telephone 
interview. "It's disrespectful." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden wrote to UC President David Gardner and the regents asking them to set a 
date on which "no group is forced to disregard its religious creed in order to 
attend." 
</P>
<P>
Both the Community Relations Committee of the Jewish Federation Council and the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith also sent letters asking that the meeting 
not conflict with a major Jewish holiday.

SAUDIS TO FUND U.S. FORCES AND AID EGYPT, OTHER ALLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

JIDDA, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and King Fahd agreed Thursday on the 
outlines of a multibillion-dollar Saudi payment for U.S. military operations in 
the Persian Gulf and to cushion the impact of the crisis on poor front-line 
countries such as Egypt and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Saudi officials announced what one Saudi diplomat called "a meeting of 
the minds" after about two hours of talks between Baker and the king and a 
subsequent hourlong meeting between Baker and Prince Saud al Faisal, the 
foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said the Saudis are ready to pay substantially all of 
the Pentagon's "in-country" costs such as fuel, transportation, water and other 
expenditures needed to maintain the growing American fighting force in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The official said Washington hopes to recover from other friendly countries all 
or most of the rest of the incremental cost of the deployment such as the 
airlift and sea lift required to carry the troops to the region. That would 
leave the United States footing the bill only for salaries and other items that 
would be the same if the troops remained at bases such as Ft. Bragg, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
However, Baker said the gulf operation is expected to add $6 billion to 
Pentagon spending by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, U.S. officials said the Saudis agreed to expand the aid they are 
already providing to Egypt, Turkey and other traditional trading partners of 
Iraq and Kuwait that have been hurt by the trade embargo against the regime of 
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
One official said such payments are vital to prevent the unraveling of the 
international determination to resist Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
"You can assume that Saudi Arabia will do its fair share toward the whole 
process," a senior Saudi official said. "There was a meeting of the minds. I 
think the United States will not be dissatisfied with what Saudi Arabia is 
willing to do." 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said that Saudi Arabia offered a general commitment to 
help defray the cost of the crisis three weeks ago. During the meeting with 
Baker, the agreement was "refined" and spelled out in greater detail. However, 
the official said that some additional work will be needed before the final 
dollar amount can be determined. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, U.S. officials said the Saudi delegation told Baker that Arab 
public opinion, which showed substantial sympathy for Hussein in the early days 
of the crisis, now seems to be swinging strongly against the Iraqi strongman. 
</P>
<P>
"Our judgment coincides with that of the Saudis," one official said. "This is 
in part because of the large numbers of Arabs who are getting out of Iraq and 
Kuwait and telling their stories at home." 
</P>
<P>
A ranking State Department official told reporters traveling with Baker that 
the Saudis have gained impressive profits "across the full range of their 
production" because of sharp increases in oil prices since Iraq's Aug. 2 
invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke before Baker's meeting with the king, said the Saudi 
windfall profits -- which could total as much as $60 million a day -- will 
"certainly make it easier for them to be more forthcoming in 
responsibility-sharing." 
</P>
<P>
Baker would not say how much he asked Fahd to contribute. But State Department 
officials confirmed a published report that the United States is asking the 
kingdom for at least $6.5 billion before the end of this year -- about $2.5 
billion for U.S. military activities and $4 billion to ease the burden of the 
crisis on needy front-line states. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's late-night meeting with Fahd began promptly after the secretary of 
state arrived at the monarch's summer palace beside the Red Sea following a 
lavish dinner with the foreign minister, Prince Saud. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Fahd has often let visitors wait for hours in his anteroom, but 
Baker was spared that fate. The king also underlined the seriousness of the 
meeting by holding it around a business-like wooden conference table instead of 
on the informal couches he usually prefers. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady began a similar fund-raising trip earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Baker meets today in the Saudi mountain resort of Taif with Kuwait's ousted 
emir, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, and in Abu Dhabi with Sheik Zayed ibn 
Sultan al Nuhayan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab 
Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was clearly uncomfortable with descriptions of his trip as a fund-raising 
effort. He insisted that he is also trying to shore up the international effort 
to "maintain the political and economic isolation of Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the purposes of this trip is to approach some countries on a 
responsibility-sharing basis," Baker said. "There are other purposes that I see 
as equally important." 
</P>
<P>
He managed a controlled smile when accompanying reporters presented him with a 
tin cup engraved: "Nothing Less Than $1 Billion."

IRAQ MOVES TO AVERT POSSIBLE U.S. REPRISALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Iraqi government moved swiftly Thursday to avert possible U.S. military 
reprisals, with several concessions interpreted here as clear signals that 
President Saddam Hussein would go to almost any length to avoid clashing with 
the multinational force facing him in the Saudi Arabian desert. 
</P>
<P>
The steps included a decision to give in to to U.S. demands for consular access 
to an American citizen wounded by Iraqi gunfire in Kuwait and an invitation to 
President Bush to address the Iraqi nation on television, which Bush quickly 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi concession on the wounded American came a day after the U.S. State 
Department, in a terse announcement, said the unidentified man had been shot by 
an Iraqi soldier. The department demanded that U.S. consular officials be 
permitted to see him, and analysts here read into this an implied threat of 
military retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
According to Western diplomats in Baghdad, the Iraqi moves were a clear 
departure from the generally hard line that Hussein has followed since his Aug. 
2 invasion of neighboring Kuwait. In addressing the United States and the other 
nations in the multinational force that assembled to protect Saudi Arabia from 
the Iraqi army, Hussein's rhetoric has been fiery and confrontational. On 
Wednesday, he called for Muslims to join a jihad -- holy war -- against the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi confirmation of the shooting incident, the diplomats said, was a rare 
display of candor for the Iraqi leadership, which routinely refuses to comment 
on virtually everything that puts their country in a negative light. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's top official spokesman, Naji Hadithi, said at a hastily arranged press 
conference Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
"I have to confirm here that the American citizen was inadvertently wounded in 
his hand, and the wound is a very slight wound. He is recovering now in the 
province of Kuwait (Iraq now refers to occupied Kuwait as one of its 
provinces). Consular access will be given to the American Embassy in Baghdad." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the circumstances of the shooting -- which occurred in an area 
where Iraqi soldiers have been rounding up foreigners to add to a human shield 
at strategic locations -- Hadithi replied, "I don't have that information, but 
he was wounded by accident." 
</P>
<P>
According to the State Department version of the incident, based on accounts 
from Kuwait, the shooting occurred as Iraqi soldiers seeking to round up 
Americans from an apartment building in Kuwait knocked on the door of one unit, 
then entered as an American in the room was climbing out the window in an 
attempt to evade capture. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis shot at the man, hitting his forearm, and, according to an 
unofficial description provided by a knowledgeable source -- causing him to 
fall and severely injure his leg. The man was taken to a hospital in Kuwait, 
while other Americans caught in the roundup were moved to the Mansour Melia 
Hotel in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to let U.S. officials see the wounded man marks the first time 
since the occupation of Kuwait that Iraq has allowed face-to-face contact 
between U.S. diplomats and any of the estimated 2,000 U.S. nationals still in 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi regime informed American officials that the wounded man is expected 
to be discharged from a hospital shortly but will remain in Iraqi custody. 
According to the State Department, U.S. officials will be allowed to visit him 
when he is out of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Hadithi made it clear that the officials who visit the wounded man must be from 
the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Even though nine American diplomats are holding 
out at the embassy in Kuwait, the Iraqis insist that because Kuwait is no 
longer an independent country, there are no longer any embassies there. 
</P>
<P>
"The American Embassy is in the capital, in Baghdad," Hadithi said. 
</P>
<P>
President Hussein has ordered all the embassies in Kuwait to shut down. More 
than a dozen, including the American facility, are still open. They are 
surrounded by troops, and the occupants are said to be desperately short of 
food and water. 
</P>
<P>
Hadithi recalled that President Bush had complained about not getting equal 
time after American television networks aired long, unedited interviews with 
Hussein. Bush, he said, "expressed the desire to have a chance to address the 
Iraqi people, and we have said yes, OK, we are ready to send an Iraqi TV crew 
to Washington to interview Mr. Bush." 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "we will not censor it." 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat in Baghdad said the change in tone on Baghdad's part 
indicates that the Iraqis "seem to be looking for some negotiating room." 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing Hussein can afford right now is all-out war with the West," the 
diplomat said. "If that happens, he knows he's finished. The shooting of this 
American clearly was a mistake by panicked or trigger-happy troops. It appears 
the president was genuinely afraid of a military response from President Bush, 
and so they're doing some fast damage control." 
</P>
<P>
Despite those concessions, there was a hard edge to one Iraqi announcement 
Thursday. Iraq's justice minister, Akram Abdul-Kader, ordered public 
prosecutors and police to revive a 1987 law that "a foreigner violating the 
entry and exit procedures . . . will be sentenced to life or temporary 
imprisonment, and all cash in his possession will be confiscated." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the official Iraqi News Agency, the justice minister also 
repeated an order given Aug. 24 that anyone caught harboring a foreigner would 
face charges of espionage, punishable by death. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hussein was using the military stalemate as an opportunity to 
continue his diplomatic search for holes in the international embargo that is 
strangling Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
He sent Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz, fresh from talks in Moscow, an erstwhile 
ally, to Iran, an erstwhile enemy. Deputy Foreign Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan 
was in China. Hussein himself spent much of the day in talks with King Hussein 
of neighboring Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat said of this activity: "They've been working on the (U.N.) 
Security Council members, to see if they're still firm. Iraq has to chip away 
at the edges and see how well-built the structure is. If this fails, they'll 
have to think of something else. What they need is time." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign women and children were still being moved out of the region, by 
overland routes from Kuwait to Baghdad, and by air from Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, a Canadian government charter flight carrying 136 Canadian 
passengers, 10 Irish and 12 Americans left Baghdad for Amman, followed by a 
British charter filled with many of the 306 British women and children who had 
come to Baghdad by bus Tuesday night from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said that most of the 1,400 American women and children 
estimated to be in Kuwait were still in hiding, too frightened to put any faith 
in the offer of safe passage. 
</P>
<P>
But the diplomats said they are certain that the Americans will begin coming 
out today.

GULF CRISIS: THE PRESIDENT ACCEPTS BAGHDAD OFFER FOR BROADCAST, CALLING IT A 
'REAL OPPORTUNITY.' CHARTERED PLANES WOULD PICK UP THE STRANDED AMERICANS.

<P>
President Bush accepted an offer from Baghdad on Thursday to address the people 
of Iraq by television, saying the 10-to-15-minute speech will provide a "real 
opportunity" to explain why he has sent American soldiers to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the address, to be videotaped 
in the next few days, will deliver a "very distinct message" to an Iraqi 
population bracing for potential conflict between its own army and a U.S. 
contingent that now numbers 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the United States sought to plug a potential hole in the 
worldwide trade embargo against Iraq as China, Iran, India and other nations 
signaled their intent to ship food and medical supplies to Baghdad to ease the 
impact of the sanctions on civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations urged a special Security 
Council committee to explicitly prohibit such unilateral shipments despite an 
exemption in the U.N.-mandated embargo for humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
But that argument encountered sharp division within the 15-member panel as 
Cuba, Yemen and other countries argued that worsening conditions in Baghdad 
justified emergency food and medical aid, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The developments came as the United States reached a separate accord with Iraq 
on Thursday to begin an airlift of Americans stranded in Kuwait and issued a 
vigorous protest in response to the now-confirmed shooting of a U.S. citizen by 
Iraqi troops in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq said the wounded man, who was shot while trying to evade capture, will 
remain in custody after his release from a hospital in Kuwait. The State 
Department expressed its "outrage" at the action. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they hope that the airlift, to begin this morning when a 
U.S.-chartered Iraqi Air- ways plane lands in Kuwait on a flight bound 
ultimately for Jordan, eventually would carry hundreds of stranded Americans 
out of harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements on the airlift and televised message appeared to signal some 
progress in low-level talks between U.S. and Iraqi officials that had 
previously produced scant results. With the President preparing to depart 
tonight for a meeting in Helsinki with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
they added to a flurry of diplomatic efforts to ease the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In a political speech here, however, Bush bluntly reiterated that the United 
States is prepared to do "whatever it takes" to force Iraq to withdraw from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But the threat of cracks in the embargo signaled what one U.S. official 
described as an indication that unresolved questions about humanitarian aid to 
Iraq are now "percolating up as a political issue." 
</P>
<P>
The official characterized the mounting support for food aid as a response to 
new Iraqi efforts to dramatize the plight of civilians who are beginning to 
feel the impact of the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
The countries now openly discussing emergency aid to Iraq contend that food and 
medical shipments are permitted under the exemption for humanitarian aid set 
forth in the U.N. sanctions. But the United States, backed by Britain and 
France, argued in the committee meeting that only the U.N. itself is empowered 
to authorize such assistance. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official reiterated that the United States regards the cutoff of 
food as an important weapon against Iraq, noting pointedly that "Saddam Hussein 
has said he will feed his army first." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney issued an unambiguous reminder about 
American military might, asserting that the United States now has "over 100,000 
military personnel" in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was the first public disclosure by any Bush Administration 
official of the number of Americans sent to the Middle East since the U.S. 
buildup began a month ago. Defense Department sources said the United States 
expects to have 150,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen in place by the first week 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
The White House decision to take up Iraq on its offer of television time came 
just a day after the Iraqi information minister proposed that a crew from the 
nation's state-run station interview Bush to allow him to speak directly to the 
Iraqi people. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. response, however, involved a change of terms. Fitzwater told 
reporters aboard the new Air Force One that Bush had decided to videotape his 
remarks rather than submit to the proposed interview. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Mashat did not criticize the change, stating that the 
speech will be broadcast "in its entirety" on Iraqi TV. 
</P>
<P>
The offer to permit Bush to speak directly to the people of Iraq left White 
House officials surprised and divided over how they should respond -- while 
also tantalized by the opportunity it appeared to present. 
</P>
<P>
A senior White House official said advisers to the President debated the 
appropriate U.S. response at length. He summarized the division in this way: 
"If you don't do it, it would be seen as a sign of intransigence. If you do it, 
you could be giving credibility to Hussein's operation." 
</P>
<P>
"It was seen as a clever idea by (Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein, as part of 
the propaganda war," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "It 
puts us in an awkward situation." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has been concerned about the frequent appearances on U.S. 
television of a dapper, mustachioed Iraqi spokesman who has delivered what U.S. 
officials regard as vituperative diatribes on behalf of Hussein that often are 
broadcast in their entirety in this country. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bush's ability to deliver his message to the people of Iraq 
-- who he has strongly suggested should rise up and overthrow their leader -- 
has been limited to news reports broadcast by the Voice of America that have 
consistently been jammed in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining Bush's decision to accept the Iraqi offer, Fitzwater said: "The 
President has a very distinct message he wants to give the people of Iraq about 
our purpose for being in the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the White House was concerned that Iraq would censor or distort 
Bush's remarks, Fitzwater said: "We assume the offer means they will broadcast 
the message in its entirety, and certainly we will make it available to the 
rest of the world to see." 
</P>
<P>
Bush made no mention of the offer in his speeches here and in Tallahassee, 
Fla., but in the latter appearance he sounded a likely theme of his upcoming 
message, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"Our argument is not with the people of Iraq. Rather, it is with Iraq's 
dictator, who uses innocent hostages as shields." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "There can be no compromise when it comes to sovereignty for Kuwait 
-- and the removal of all Iraqi forces. And that removal must be complete, 
immediate and unconditional." 
</P>
<P>
The airlift arrangements announced by the State Department represented the 
first agreement between the United States and Iraq to permit the evacuation of 
private U.S. citizens from occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Mark Dillen described the mission as a "flight of mercy, a 
flight intended to help Americans who have been held hostage against their 
will." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the accord had been struck between the government of Iraq 
and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. They described the terms as tentative and said 
it remained unclear whether men would be permitted to accompany women and 
children allowed to leave by Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, State Department officials cited new reports of Americans being rounded 
up in Kuwait and said the number of U.S. citizens in Iraqi custody had 
increased to more than 80. Some Americans were captured while seeking to join 
an Iraqi-authorized British convoy, they said. 
</P>
<P>
New radio broadcasts over the Voice of America alerted U.S. citizens in Kuwait 
to expect an airlift and urged them to telephone the U.S. Embassy for details 
but included a blunt warning that they should not show up at the U.S. Embassy 
in person. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said the airlift plans called for a standard-sized Iraqi 
jetliner to pick up a load of U.S. citizens in Kuwait this morning, return to 
Baghdad so Iraqi officials can issue exit permits to the passengers at 
plane-side, and then fly on to Amman, Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
A department spokesman said the United States planned "to continue this 
procedure as long as we have U.S. citizens who want to leave Iraq and Kuwait." 
But he added: "We only know of one flight for sure, and that's the one 
scheduled for tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
In an additional indication of uncertainty about the arrangements, acting 
Secretary of State Robert H. Kimmitt told Iraqi Ambassador Mashat in a private 
meeting that the United States "expects full Iraqi assistance in facilitating" 
the exodus, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of the acting secretary of state at the meeting with Mashat was 
intended also to convey official fury at what the State Department called 
Iraq's "outrageous behavior" in the shooting of the American in Kuwait, the 
officials said. Spokesman Dillen reiterated at the State Department briefing 
that the United States "holds the Iraqi government responsible for the health 
and welfare of all American citizens held against their will in Kuwait and 
Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
He denounced as "extremely disturbing" the use of gunfire by Iraqi troops "in 
their efforts to round up foreigners" and said the United States will demand a 
"full accounting" of the incident from Iraqi authorities. 
</P>
<P>
But he pointedly declined to comment on any U.S. retaliatory action, saying: 
"I'm just not going to speculate here on what consequences may follow any Iraqi 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was scheduled to leave Washington tonight for an overnight flight to 
Helsinki, Finland, for a one-day meeting Sunday with Gorbachev. Aides have said 
the meeting will focus primarily on the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater played down the prospect that Bush would link Soviet cooperation in 
the gulf to assurances of improved chances for U.S. economic aid for the Soviet 
Union, as reported Thursday by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be talking to the Soviets about technical assistance," Fitzwater said 
while denying any direct linkage. He noted, however, that Commerce Secretary 
Robert Mosbacher will lead a group of 15 U.S. corporate chief executives on a 
visit to the Soviet Union to discuss investment activities, and they will meet 
with Bush.

JUSTICES REVERSE PERJURY CONVICTION OF HEDGECOCK; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: STATE COURT SETS ASIDE CONSPIRACY VERDICT. CLAIMS OF BAILIFF, JUROR 
MISCONDUCT MAY BE RECONSIDERED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday reversed the perjury convictions of former 
San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock and temporarily set aside a conspiracy 
conviction to permit a trial court to reconsider claims of misconduct against a 
bailiff and juror. 
</P>
<P>
The high court held unanimously that further proceedings on the conspiracy 
count are warranted by the "serious nature" of defense allegations that the 
bailiff improperly urged jurors to return a swift verdict and provided them 
with liquor after their daily deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
One juror, the defense said, had become so intoxicated the night before the 
verdict she became violently ill and was unable to deliberate the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling opened the way for what could be a third trial for the 44-year-old 
Hedgecock, now a radio talk-show host in San Diego. As mayor, he was charged 
with conspiring with officials of the now-defunct investment firm of J. David 
&amp; Co. to funnel $360,000 in illegal donations into his 1983 mayoral 
campaign and with perjury for allegedly falsifying financial disclosure 
statements to conceal those contributions. He denied there was a conspiracy and 
said any misstatements were inadvertent. 
</P>
<P>
After his first trial ended in a jury deadlock, Hedgecock was convicted by a 
San Diego Superior Court jury in December, 1985, and resigned from office. His 
sentence of one year in prison and a fine of $1,000 were set aside during his 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The high court, in an opinion by Justice Joyce L. Kennard, ruled 5-to-2 that 
the 12 perjury counts against Hedgecock must be overturned because the trial 
judge improperly ruled that the statements or omissions on the disclosure forms 
were "material," or significant enough to support the charges. That was a 
factual determination to be made by jurors, not the judge, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
On the conspiracy charge, the justices held unanimously that the trial court 
may hold an evidentiary hearing -- complete with questioning of the jurors -- 
over the allegations of misconduct. The trial judge, then-Superior Court Judge 
William L. Todd Jr., who since has been appointed to the state Court of Appeal, 
had rejected the allegations on the basis of written statements by jurors and 
the bailiff. Todd erroneously concluded he lacked authority to summon witnesses 
to a hearing, the high court said. 
</P>
<P>
The justices said that now a trial judge -- presumably not Todd -- must decide 
whether to hold a hearing on the charges of misconduct and determine whether to 
grant a retrial on the conspiracy charge or uphold the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller Jr. said he would not decide whether to 
try Hedgecock again on the perjury counts until the fate of the conspiracy 
conviction is resolved in court. Miller denied Thursday's ruling was a 
significant setback, noting: "We still have a felony conviction (for 
conspiracy) and we have the ability to retry Hedgecock for perjury." 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock's attorney, Charles M. Sevilla, welcomed the ruling and expressed 
confidence the conspiracy conviction would be overturned in further 
proceedings. "We have a strong case for showing taint (in the verdict) and I 
think it is going to get even stronger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock, commenting on his radio show, denied his victory was won on a 
technicality. "Directing a jury verdict is not a technicality -- it's a 
kangaroo court," he said. "Tampering with the jury, pressuring the jury with 
booze and stories . . . is not a technicality." 
</P>
<P>
The allegations of misconduct arose shortly after Hedgecock's conviction. Some 
jurors said in affidavits that the bailiff, Allen Burroughs, had told them that 
sequestering jurors in a hotel was costly and that there should be a quick 
verdict; had recounted a story of a previous case in a misleading attempt to 
explain a point of law; and had provided jurors with liquor when they were not 
deliberating. One juror was described by others on the panel as being so hung 
over on the final day of deliberations that she reclined on a couch with a 
pillow over her head and repeatedly went to the bathroom to vomit. 
</P>
<P>
In their affidavits, Burroughs denied trying to influence deliberations and the 
juror denied being hung over, saying that while she had been ill, her mental 
processes had not been affected. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's decision, the high court urged trial courts to make sure that 
bailiffs make no statements to jurors that can be construed as an attempt to 
influence deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"Any comment by a bailiff that is likely to influence the deliberative 
processes of the jury constitutes serious misconduct," Kennard wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The court said further that the allegations of alcohol use by jurors were 
"equally serious" matters. While a juror need not abstain when not 
deliberating, the use of alcohol that later "renders the juror unable to 
competently perform" duties constitutes misconduct, Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
The justices were divided over whether it was up to the jury -- or the judge -- 
to determine the significance of statements or omissions on campaign disclosure 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard's majority opinion rejected state prosecutors' contentions that under 
the Political Reform Act, any failure to disclose or a misstatement about a 
contribution was inherently significant in a case of alleged perjury. 
</P>
<P>
Such an omission or misstatement was significant only if it were important in 
evaluating a candidate's suitability for office -- and that question should be 
resolved by jurors, Kennard wrote. When judges erroneously make that 
determination themselves, the error renders the trial "fundamentally unfair" 
and a verdict of guilt must be reversed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Justice David N. Eagleson, joined by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, dissented 
on that point, saying the issue was one of law to be decided by the judge. Even 
if the question were one for the jury, the error did not raise doubts about the 
perjury verdict and thus reversal was not warranted, Eagleson said.

LAWMAKERS SEEK TO STALL SMOG PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THREE STATE LEGISLATORS ASK THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO DELAY 
REQUIREMENT THAT OIL COMPANIES MUST SELL A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF CLEANER FUELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that the state Air Resources Board may be acting without authority, 
legislative leaders have urged the agency to delay key elements of a 
far-reaching plan to require a new generation of low-emission cars for 
California. 
</P>
<P>
First unveiled in December, the program for low-emission vehicles and clean 
fuel would set the course for smog controls on California vehicles well into 
the 21st Century. It is a cornerstone of efforts by Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties to comply with federal clean air 
standards by 2007. 
</P>
<P>
But, in virtually identical letters, Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. 
(D-San Francisco), Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra and 
state Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno urged the ARB to delay a 
major provision requiring oil companies to meet monthly sales quotas for 
alternative fuels that will be used to power future ultra-low-emission cars. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposed regulations raise a series of major policy issues which we 
believe deserve legislative review," the three legislators said in letters to 
ARB Chairwoman Jananne Sharpless. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the letters, two of which were dated Aug. 30 and one Aug. 31, were 
obtained Thursday by The Times. The ARB is scheduled to vote on the proposal 
Sept. 27 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The strongly worded letters came after extensive lobbying by Arco Products Co. 
President George H. Babikian. Arco confirmed Thursday that it drafted the 
letters signed by the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpless' office said she has not replied and has made no decision on whether 
to comply. The ARB staff has said it believes the board has authority to impose 
the fuel mandates without additional legislative approval. But the full 
Legislature has the power to change laws governing the clean-fuels program. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and regional air quality officials worry that a delay in the 
September vote could endanger the quota plan and spark further reassesment of 
the ARB's program. 
</P>
<P>
State Energy Commission chairman Charles R. Imbrecht called the sales quotas a 
"critical component" of the total package and said he advised Sharpless to 
"tough it out" and resist any legislative opposition. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Lents, executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District, said a short delay would not pose a problem. But he cautioned, 
"Unfortunately, an initial deferral can often lead to a permanent deferral. I 
think that would be a major setback." 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the low-emissions program amounts to putting on the books a new 
super-strict tailpipe emission standard. Cars would have to be twice as clean 
as the cleanest conventional-powered gasoline car on the road in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The ARB staff has acknowledged that there is no way that the new standard can 
be met with existing smog controls and conventional gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
That means that automobile makers would have to build cars that either had 
advanced smog controls or ran on cleaner-burning alternative fuels, or some 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
While the state would leave it up to the automobile industry and oil companies 
to meet the new standards in any way they could, Babikian said that as a 
practical matter, methanol is the only alternative to gasoline in the near 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies would be required to sell whatever fuel was needed by the 
low-emission vehicles, such as methanol and compressed natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
In their letters, the lawmakers listed concerns that have been raised over the 
last several weeks by Babikian. The letters, however, made no mention of Arco 
or its president. 
</P>
<P>
Babikian met in Sacramento last month with a number of lawmakers, including 
Brown, as well as Gov. George Deukmejian and Sharpless. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers wrote that they were "especially concerned" that oil companies would 
be required to meet a sales quota for clean fuels. That requirement would take 
effect in the South Coast Air Basin beginning in 1994, under the ARB proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Arco argues that if drivers have a choice of fuels they will probably buy the 
cheapest. If methanol was more expensive, Babikian said, gasoline companies 
would have to raise the price of gasoline in order to subsidize a below-market 
price for methanol to make it competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"To subsidize methanol in a secret, clandestine way, we think is wrong. . . . A 
lot of these fuels will have to be subsidized early on to get them started and 
I think our legislative leaders ought to be willing to do that instead of 
hiding the subsidy," Babikian said. 
</P>
<P>
ARB spokesman Bill Sessa said Thursday that the actual increase in gasoline 
prices would be less than one cent per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
In their letters, the three lawmakers asked: "Should owners of existing 
gasoline-powered vehicles be forced to pay higher prices for gasoline in order 
to subsidize more expensive clean fuels. . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
George Dunn, Arco's manager of government relations and political affairs, said 
Thursday: "We've endorsed the general direction of the ARB regulations. They've 
done an extraordinary job in a very difficult field. But they've fallen prey, 
we think, to a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important enough matter that we think there should be a public 
debate on the consequences of this decision." 
</P>
<P>
Several other issues were raised by the lawmakers: 
</P>
<P>
* Should oil companies be required to sell specific quantities of clean fuels 
when the owners of flexible-fueled vehicles are not required to buy clean 
fuels? 
</P>
<P>
* Should gasoline service stations be required to sell compressed natural gas, 
or do space limitations and the estimated cost of $270,000 per station make 
that impractical? 
</P>
<P>
* Should flexible-fueled vehicles be considered "clean burning" even though 
they would be allowed to emit twice the quantity of ozone-forming pollutants 
when they burn conventional gasoline rather than clean-fuel alternatives? 
</P>
<P>
* Should existing methanol pilot programs in the state be given more time to 
see if they work before the ARB mandates sales of specific types and volumes of 
fuel?

CARPENTER ADMITS ROLE IN PUSHING BOGUS BILL; 
</P>
<P>
CORRUPTION TRIAL: EX-STATE SENATOR INSISTS ACTIONS WERE NOT LINKED TO $20,000 
PAYMENT BY UNDERCOVER FBI AGENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former state Sen. Paul Carpenter, testifying in his own defense, admitted 
Thursday that he helped promote passage of bogus legislation planted by the 
FBI, but insisted that his actions had no connection to a $20,000 payment he 
received from an undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
Suspecting he was the target of a sting, Carpenter said he took the money and 
carried out his own "reverse sting" of the FBI. But the Norwalk Democrat 
acknowledged that he never conducted any investigation of his own or reported 
his conclusions to any law enforcement agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I could accept the contribution and in no way break any laws," 
Carpenter told a federal court jury. "I thought if it was a sting, I was going 
to benefit from the campaign contribution and make sure I violated no laws in 
the process." 
</P>
<P>
During a grueling cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Atty. John Panneton, the 
former senator also admitted that he lied in a letter to the Fair Political 
Practices Commission when he claimed he had notified the undercover FBI agent, 
John E. Brennan, about the state's campaign reporting laws. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter also acknowledged that after receiving the $20,000 contribution, he 
gave $17,000 to three members of a Senate committee who had voted in favor of 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Now a member of the State Board of Equalization, Carpenter is charged with four 
counts of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy in connection with the 
long-running sting investigation of corruption in the state Capitol. As part of 
the sting, Brennan posed in 1986 as an Alabama businessman seeking passage of 
special legislation to help his company open a shrimp plant near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, who spent the entire day on the witness stand, appeared relaxed and 
composed during most of his testimony. At times, he tried to make wry jokes and 
observations about the political process, quoting from sources as diverse as 
comedian Will Rogers and cartoon character Bart Simpson in attempting to make 
his points. 
</P>
<P>
But during three hours of cross-examination by Panneton, Carpenter made key 
admissions that could hurt his case when it goes to the jury next week. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the former senator admitted that he telephoned 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), the official author of the FBI bill, 
and advised her on the strategy to use in winning passage of the measure in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he acknowledged that he urged Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), 
the Senate author of the bill, to arrive on the floor of the Senate promptly so 
that he could bring up the measure for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter testified that he was willing to go see then-Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh 
to work out his potential opposition to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter said he initially suspected the shrimp bill was part of an FBI sting 
but later was not so sure. He said he never told Moore or Greene of his 
suspicions, confiding only to Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia) and Carpenter aide 
John Shahabian. Shahabian, who himself was caught in the sting, testified 
against Carpenter in the trial. "After the bill had passed and no one was taken 
away in handcuffs, I decided I was mistaken," Carpenter told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Panneton grilled Carpenter about key statements the senator made in 
conversations with the agent that were secretly tape-recorded. In one 
conversation, Carpenter said he "would take care of" other senators who sat on 
the committee where the bill would be heard. Carpenter noted to Brennan that 
members of the committee "fortuitously" were up for reelection that year. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter explained that his statement was designed only to calm Brennan and 
assure him the bill would pass. "That was my way of saying, 'Don't worry about 
it,' " he testified. 
</P>
<P>
But Panneton then confronted Carpenter with his campaign contribution reports, 
which showed that he gave $7,000 to Greene, $5,000 to Keene and $5,000 to Sen. 
Wadie Deddeh (D-Chula Vista). All three were members of the Senate Banking and 
Commerce Committee and voted for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
During his testimony, Carpenter said he believed he did not violate any law 
because he did not vote for the bill when it was on the Senate floor. At one 
point, he said, he looked at Brennan in the visitors gallery and laughed at 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter expected that his failure to vote for the measure would anger Brennan 
if he were indeed an FBI agent. Paraphrasing Bart Simpson, Carpenter said, "If 
I didn't vote on the bill, he'd have a cow." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that it was not necessary for Carpenter to vote on the bill 
in order to violate federal extortion laws. Taking any official action to help 
the bill in exchange for the money is against the law, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
But Carpenter said that after the bill passed he decided he was wrong about the 
sting. He later met for lunch with Brennan and accepted a final installment of 
$5,000.

Recalling that she served as mayor of San Francisco when AIDS first emerged as 
a "so-called gay cancer" in 1981, Dianne Feinstein visited a hospice Thursday 
where AIDS victims go to die and pledged an accelerated state campaign against 
the disease if she is elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there at the beginning and I hope I'm there at the end," the Democratic 
nominee told male AIDS victims while touring the 25-bed Chris Brownlie Hospice 
near Dodger Stadium. It is the largest such facility in the nation that is 
qualified to receive federal and state aid under the Medicaid program. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, the Republican Feinstein hopes to succeed, has been 
virtually silent on AIDS, Feinstein said. "I will take a dramatically different 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
She outlined a program that included speeding up the certification of AIDS 
drugs, preventing discrimination against victims, assuring insurance coverage 
and reorganizing the state's AIDS programs. Feinstein said she would reactivate 
a state AIDS commission and have it report directly to her. Each of 
California's 58 counties would be required to develop a plan for dealing with 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate Los Angeles appearance, Sen. Pete Wilson, Feinstein's Republican 
opponent, told reporters he would favor "the kind of funding and research that 
we have been involved in." He also singled out the need for accelerated testing 
of AIDS drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said that much could be done by an activist governor without spending 
additional money, but if more funds were required, she would get them. 
</P>
<P>
"When I do that budget I'm going to see that AIDS is treated as the No. 1 
health emergency and that the state is prepared to accept a leadership role," 
she said. "If that takes moremoney, I'm not going to be shy. I'm going to find 
ways of getting it." 
</P>
<P>
During her tour, Feinstein chatted quietly with several patients in a sunny 
sitting room, shaking hands with each as she moved along. One man confined to a 
wheelchair and who spoke with difficulty continued to grip her hand tightly -- 
apparently without realizing it -- as she was summoned to visit the second 
floor. After several seconds of gentle tugging, Feinstein carefully extracted 
her right hand from his grip. She then gave his hand a final squeeze of 
apparent reassurance before walking away. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a statement to reporters, Feinstein thanked the facility staff for 
the work it does: "Perhaps for any one of God's children, it's the biggest 
test, I think, of the belief in humanity and compassion and the ability to 
sustain that humanity and compassion over a long period of time without what 
they call burnout." She also talked of the "courage and tenacity" of the 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Before she left, one patient invited Feinstein to pay a return visit after "you 
get elected." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh sure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"And you're going to run for President one day?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't think that," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be old and tired a lot sooner than that, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said she first heard of AIDS when, as mayor, leaders of the gay 
community "came to me and told me about the terrifying and strange rumors of a 
so-called gay cancer." Her administration quickly came up with $187,000 to 
investigate the reports, she said, the first public health funding for AIDS in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
More Californians have died of AIDS than were killed in the Korean and Vietnam 
wars, she said. She added that it would be a mistake for anyone to think the 
virus is limited just to gay males and those who live in cities, or to think 
that the disease is static. Growing numbers of women and children are 
contracting AIDS, and no corner of California is safe from the disease, 
Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
When prodded for sources of new state revenue, Feinstein said she would be 
willing to increase income taxes on the wealthy if necessary. She said that 
most of the tax-reduction benefits in California in recent years have gone to 
couples with more than a combined income of $200,000 -- a group that includes 
herself and financier husband Richard Blum. If an income-tax boost was 
necessary, she said it should shift more of the burden back on the rich but not 
increase the taxes in lower brackets. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has refused to rule out the possible need for a tax increase, but said 
this week he would oppose any change in income-tax rates.

CHARITY HOSPITAL HAS MONEY CRISISFACILITY SERVES 1.7 MILLION PALESTINIANS. 
INVASION CUTS OFF FUNDS FROM KUWAIT.

<P>
For two decades, Makassed Hospital atop the Mount of Olives in East Jerusalem 
has been the chief medical center for 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied 
territories, almost their only succor when seriously ill or injured. 
</P>
<P>
But now, because of a shut-off of funds from Kuwait, the 250-bed charity 
hospital is facing financial disaster, and the staff is worried. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and other sources in the Persian Gulf region have supplied fully 70% of 
the hospital's annual budget of $15 million, and not a dime has arrived from 
the region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. (The other 30% comes 
from private donors, mostly Palestinian, and fees for treatment paid by those 
who can afford it.) 
</P>
<P>
"These funds are vital to our future," the hospital's director, Dr. Adnan S. 
Hamad, said, poring over budget figures in his office. "This means we will 
immediately have to cut down on all planned improvements in every department 
and outpatient services." 
</P>
<P>
Makassed treats about 60,000 outpatients a year, along with 12,000 hospitalized 
patients. About 5,900 surgical operations were performed last year, and about 
half the beds were occupied by surgical patients. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, the hospital has been running at about 107% of 
capacity; occasionally, cots are set up in the corridors. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hamad has sent general manager Mahmoud Habbibbeh to seek out potential 
donors in the Arab world. But Hamad admits that the task has not been helped by 
official Palestinian support for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Raising money is now the most important concern of mine," Hamad said. "We are 
appealing to anyone who can help us -- in the Arab world, in Europe, in the 
United States. We are calling on all those who believe in medicine for needy 
human beings. But we are worried that our call for help is falling on deaf 
ears." 
</P>
<P>
Hamad, 34, who received his degree in hospital administration from England's 
Manchester University, admits that Makassed has been called the "Intifada 
Hospital" after the term in Arabic for the Palestinian uprising against the 
Israelis that began in December of 1987. He thinks the appellation is 
undeserved. 
</P>
<P>
"We were under occupation," he said, "and many of the intifada victims came 
here because they were afraid to go to Israeli hospitals, where they might be 
arrested. We have always been a charity hospital, and we take in anyone in 
need. About 9,000 intifada victims have been treated, mostly as outpatients. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a psychological trust between Palestinians and Makassed. But we treat 
Jews, Christians, Muslims -- anyone who comes to our doors. Many can't afford 
an Israeli hospital, or don't have the necessary medical insurance. In a way, 
we are the national health service for Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
Hamad and his assistant, Dr. Amin Thalji, 41, who is chief of pediatrics and 
was at Chicago's Cook County Hospital, point out that Makassed offers the only 
advanced medical treatment in all of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
West Bank towns like Hebron and Nablus have small infirmaries and maternity 
clinics, Thalji said, but only Makassed offers advanced treatment in such 
specialties as orthopedics, radiology, neurology, urology, postnatal care, 
open-heart surgery and other vascular techniques. About 15% of the beds are 
occupied by intensive-care patients. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital has a staff of 760, including 100 physicians and 300 nurses. It is 
the only teaching hospital in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done our best to serve an area with more than a million and a half 
people," Thalji said. "We know that the gulf crisis has caused a lot of 
economic hardship in the West Bank . . . . But we must differentiate between 
shutting down a shoe factory and a hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Hamad added: "We are trying to meet the medical needs of the Palestinian 
people. We'd hate to see the quality of medicine here suffer because of the 
crisis. But we have to make up those funds somehow. We need all the help we can 
get."

'HEART OF HORROR' BEING PROBED AS PANEL STUDIES PINOCHET YEARS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A presidential Commission for Truth and Reconciliation is looking into the 
"heart of horror," as a Chilean newspaper editor wrote recently, by researching 
fatal human rights violations under the 16 1/2-year dictatorship of Gen. 
Augusto Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the commission said it will document up to 4,000 
disappearances of detained persons and deaths by summary execution, torture and 
terrorism. And sometime near the end of this year or the beginning of next, it 
will deliver a report that could cause unrest in the Chilean armed forces, 
which turned power over to an elected civilian administration last March. 
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who continues to head the army, has repeatedly voiced concern that 
the commission's work could "affect my institution and my people." His concern 
apparently centers on fears that information gathered by the commission will 
lead to the trial of military officers for atrocities or even to illegal 
reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
"If one of my men is touched, the rule of law will be broken," he has warned. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is not empowered to make formal charges or to try anyone. But it 
already has turned over some of the information it has gathered to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protected Under Amnesty 
</P>
<P>
The main safeguard for officers accused of excesses is an amnesty decreed by 
the military government that covers the first five years of military rule, when 
most of the disappearances and killings occurred. The Supreme Court ruled 
recently that the amnesty is legally valid. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, appointed by President Patricio Aylwin in April, is making the 
most complete compilation yet of testimony, legal documents, government files, 
press reports and information collected by human rights organizations on 
political killings and disappearances during the Pinochet years. The material, 
which is being computerized for cross-checking and analysis, will include cases 
of anti-government terrorism as well as official brutality. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing appointment of the commission, Aylwin said its purpose is to 
contribute to public awareness of the causes behind "a wound still open in the 
national soul that cannot be healed by trying to forget." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent opinion poll, 62% of Santiago residents interviewed said they 
believed only "a small part" of human rights violations under the Pinochet 
government were known. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will also recommend "measures of reparation" for victims and 
official action for preventing similar violations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-member panel is headed by Raul Rettig, who has been a national 
senator and a president of the Chilean Bar Assn. The secretary, lawyer Jorge 
Correa, said the staff of 55 is made up mostly of young lawyers and legal 
interns who are working in teams to interview witnesses and relatives of 
victims around the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Interviews 
</P>
<P>
About 3,200 people are being interviewed for information on about 2,700 
killings or disappearances, Correa said. He estimated that 20% of those to be 
interviewed had not previously offered information to officials or human rights 
organizations, partly out of fear. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Otero, a conservative senator who supported Pinochet's government, said 
there is no question excesses were committed under the military regime, but he 
said the violence originated in ideological struggles dating from before the 
late President Salvador Allende's Marxist-led Administration, deposed by 
Pinochet in 1973. Otero said that, in commissioning the study, "the error was 
limiting it to the period of the dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
He said his party, National Renovation, had been concerned that the commission 
would be used for political propaganda, with "a daily media show of 
denunciations and accusations." But he acknowledged the panel has exercised 
"discretion and seriousness." 
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Gonzalez, executive secretary of a Roman Catholic Church human rights 
organization called the Vicariate of Solidarity, said that official 
clarification of the truth about injustices can serve as "a form of moral 
rehabilitation for the victims." 
</P>
<P>
Commission secretary Correa agreed but predicted that bitterness will persist. 
"This is a problem with which the country is going to have to live for many 
years to some degree," he said. "There is no good solution."

GORBACHEV'S VISIT TO JAPAN PLANNED FOR APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told Japan on Thursday that 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will make his long-planned visit here in the 
"middle of April" next year but offered no assurance that the Soviet leader 
would settle a territorial dispute that continues to poison Soviet-Japan 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze delivered the message in an hourlong meeting with Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu. 
</P>
<P>
The visit -- which after years of discussion the Soviets in 1989 scheduled for 
"sometime in 1991" -- will be designed to bring about a "fundamental 
improvement" in Soviet-Japan relations, Shevardnadze told the prime minister. 
Gorbachev, in a message that Shevardnadze relayed to Kaifu, complained that 
bilateral ties lagged far behind changes sweeping the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Although four Japanese prime ministers have visited Moscow since the two 
nations restored diplomatic relations in 1956, no top Soviet leader has ever 
traveled to Japan. The two nations have never signed a peace treaty to formally 
end World War II hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu responded that he, too, hopes that Gorbachev's visit will lead to an 
improvement in relations. But he warned the Soviet foreign minister that "the 
issue of returning the four northern islands is one that cannot be bypassed," 
according to Kazuhiko Togo, director of the Foreign Ministry's Soviet section. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets seized the islands off the east and northeast coasts of Japan's 
northernmost island of Hokkaido after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze called the territorial dispute "the most difficult and complicated 
issue" between Moscow and Tokyo. Creating an overall "environment of trust and 
goodwill" must precede a solution that both sides can accept, Togo quoted him 
as telling Kaifu. 
</P>
<P>
A solution, Shevardnadze added, must not injure the security interests of 
either country -- an apparent reference to the location of the islands on the 
outer rim of the Sea of Okhotsk, the Soviets' naval gateway to the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese diplomats said that Shevardnadze's statements marked the first time 
that the Soviet Union has acknowledged the importance of settling the 
territorial dispute as a prerequisite to improving bilateral relations. 
Previously, Shevardnadze referred to the issue only as "a difficulty" blocking 
a peace treaty and closer ties. 
</P>
<P>
Symbolizing attempts by both nations to broaden a relationship that has been 
frozen in continuing feuding over the issue, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama and 
Shevardnadze signed four technical agreements as they completed nearly nine 
hours of talks over the last two days. One involved a promise of Japanese aid 
to Soviet victims of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets' top diplomat also proposed to meet Nakayama again this month at 
the United Nations in New York and before the end of the year in Moscow. He was 
scheduled to leave Tokyo today.

Pope John Paul II, visiting one of Africa's most populous countries, spoke out 
Thursday against contraception as a way of controlling population growth. 
</P>
<P>
The pontiff said that moral responsibility was the sole Christian method of 
birth control. 
</P>
<P>
"Mastery over fertility must remain a profoundly human thing, as the church 
requires, expressing the healthy agencies of morality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope spoke at an open-air Mass attended by about 75,000 people in Gitega, a 
former capital of Burundi, 60 miles east of the present captial, Bujumbura. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old pontiff is on his seventh African visit, which earlier this 
week took him to neighboring Tanzania, and takes him today to Rwanda and Sunday 
to the Ivory Coast in west Africa. 
</P>
<P>
He has repeatedly stressed on this and past trips his belief that contraception 
in all its forms is wrong.

CHINA RECEIVES IRAQI OFFICIAL, MAY SEND FOOD

China welcomed a surprise visit Thursday by Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Taha 
Yassin Ramadan and hinted that it might send food and medicine to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"The (U.N.) resolution . . . clearly stipulates that the embargo against Iraq 
does not include supplies intended strictly for medical purposes and foodstuffs 
in humanitarian circumstances," spokeswoman Li Jinhua told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"And I agree that this point should also be strictly implemented," she added. 
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein said Wednesday that Iraqi children are endangered 
because the embargo has deprived them of food, milk and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-dominated military presence enforcing the economic blockade has choked 
off Iraq's oil exports and squeezed its supplies of imported food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 5,000 Chinese citizens in Iraq. Beijing has not announced 
any plans to withdraw them. 
</P>
<P>
India told the United Nations on Wednesday that it wants to send food and 
medicine to Iraq and Kuwait on humanitarian grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese spokeswoman said Ramadan had come to Beijing at Baghdad's request 
to discuss the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that Ramadan, who headed a 30-man delegation, would probably 
meet Vice Premier Wu Xueqian and try to dissuade China from moving closer to 
the tough stance adopted by Western powers in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
China has supported Security Council resolutions on the gulf but has taken a 
softer line than other permanent members -- the United States, Britain, France 
and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
It has called for an Arab solution and condemned possible use of force by the 
big powers as risking all-out war.

France will intervene militarily if Iraq attacks any other country in the 
Persian Gulf region but will not automatically join a U.S. attack on Iraq, 
President Francois Mitterrand said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Unless there is new Iraqi aggression, France will restrict itself to enforcing 
fully the U.N. embargo aimed at persuading Iraq to quit Kuwait and release 
foreign hostages, the president told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand added that he had spoken by telephone to President Bush and Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Thursday. Gorbachev, he said, stressed that 
there should be no split in the international front demanding that Iraq 
withdraw from Kuwait and release foreign hostages.

An American woman hiding in Kuwait said Thursday that she has heard reports of 
Iraqi soldiers wounding Americans and ransacking homes in a methodical search 
for Westerners living in fear of discovery and death. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified woman told the Cable News Network in a telephone interview 
that her information of life in occupied Kuwait city came from personal 
observations and a "local grapevine" of people who are in contact with 
hospitals and act as "go-betweens" for the American hostages. 
</P>
<P>
She said she has not left the home where she is hiding for five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In the CNN interview, arranged by Kuwaiti diplomats in Washington, D.C., the 
woman painted a portrait of a country gripped by fear and brutality. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was told that Iraqi troops had shot at least two Americans who 
"were beat up and abused and then taken to the hospital." In each case, she 
said, their legs had been broken. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department confirmed Thursday that an American man attempting to 
evade arrest was shot and wounded by Iraqi soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
From her undisclosed location, the woman reported that Iraqi troops have 
sporadically cordoned off neighborhoods in Kuwait city to search homes for U.S. 
citizens and other foreign nationals who were not moved to strategic military 
and economic sites by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"At any time of the day or night they can come into your house," she said. 
"They don't need search warrants. They just bust in." 
</P>
<P>
Calling herself "very" scared, the woman said she was forced to hide for at 
least five hours in a closet when her area was searched. 
</P>
<P>
In some regions, she said, fierce gun battles continue between Iraqi troops and 
Kuwaiti resistance fighters. 
</P>
<P>
"The resistance includes everyone -- young, old, religious women, anyone and 
everyone," she said. "The Kuwaitis want their country back, and they'll do 
anything to help get it. . . . One night last week everybody went on the roof, 
and they were doing their religious chants and . . . the army went through the 
streets shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Suspected resistance leaders, she said, are taken to Iraq, "and they're not 
heard from again." 
</P>
<P>
She also speculated that Iraqi citizens will be "the last" to feel the 
international embargo because "they stole everything that wasn't nailed down in 
Kuwait. They ransacked and robbed everything imaginable." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what she would want the United States to do, the woman responded: "Attack 
Iraq. Kill Saddam. That's the only way it's going to stop."

MANAMA, Bahrain 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Knots of angry, anguished Kuwaitis parade through the streets of Persian Gulf 
states, European capitals and American cities bearing placard portraits of a 
smiling man in a flowing white headdress held firm by a doubled black cord. 
</P>
<P>
The bright-eyed, goateed and mustachioed face belongs to His Highness the Emir, 
Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah. He is the symbol of hope for his pillaged, 
Iraqi-occupied country. At night, resistance fighters defiantly plaster his 
portrait on walls and utility poles in Kuwait city. 
</P>
<P>
But the 64-year-old Jabbar, ruler of oil-rich Kuwait for the past 23 years, is 
also the symbol of a system turning sour, according to many Kuwaiti refugees 
and others in the Persian Gulf states. 
</P>
<P>
One-family hereditary rule, and the oil revenues that made the Sabah sheiks 
legends of conspicuous wealth in recent decades, is the norm along the western 
shore of the gulf. In many ways, sheikdoms are family businesses, and highly 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti monarchy was toppled suddenly by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion, and since 
then the emir, his court and most of his senior officials have been living 
outside the Saudi Arabian city of Taif, their future uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sabahs must be restored to power," said a Kuwaiti lawyer who has found 
sanctuary for his family at a hotel here in the Bahraini capital. "But things 
will have to change. There was a weakness in the way things were run." 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat with experience in Kuwait said: "If you wanted to do some 
business in Kuwait, you dealt with the Sabahs. And it's the same with the 
Khalifas, the Thanis, the Nuhayans and the Sauds" -- the ruling families in 
Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Except for occasional disputes over oil politics and can-you-top-this 
competition in building five-star hotels, the Persian Gulf sheiks are fraternal 
Arabs, walking in the shadow of Saudi Arabia. The clannish Kuwaitis carry a 
haughty air that offends some of their neighbors, but they are proud of their 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaitis point out that their country has the gulf's only constitution and that 
it was the only one to experiment with an elected parliament (male suffrage 
only). Jabbar disbanded it four years ago and replaced it last spring with a 
consultative assembly. Half of its members were appointed, the rest chosen in 
an election boycotted by Kuwait's harried pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition complains that Jabbar is a distant leader, instinctively 
peremptory, who has little patience for the give and take of politics. 
</P>
<P>
"The state should be guided by collective decision and not by individuals," 
argued Abdul Reda Assiri, former head of Kuwait University's political science 
department, now living in the United Arab Emirates. "Its foreign policy and 
investments should be more inward-looking, as the nation has paid a high price 
for its profligacy." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kuwait was among the Middle Eastern nations cited by Amnesty 
International this year as a human rights violator. The charges are minor 
compared to those leveled against neighbors such as Iraq or Iran. But the 
London-based human rights organization accused Kuwait in March of holding about 
18 Shiite Muslims without trial since September on suspicion of plotting to 
overthrow the government. The sheikdom denied the charge and said a panel would 
be set up to deal with such questions. 
</P>
<P>
A former high Kuwaiti official insisted that the Sabahs have been generous 
rulers. He referred to a wide range of government-paid benefits, including 
subsidized housing and free education and medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say they're no good," he said, "but they're wrong. They didn't 
take the money. They gave it to the people." 
</P>
<P>
The former official -- requesting anonymity, as do most Kuwaitis with relatives 
still in Kuwait -- conceded that the welfare state had its faults, that it 
created a working class of imported foreigners and a younger generation of 
Kuwaitis who had nothing to do but play. 
</P>
<P>
"We educated our people, but we forgot to train them," he said. "They came back 
from school in the States or Europe and sought jobs taken by expatriates. Well, 
the foreigners didn't want to lose those jobs. They had the benefits too, and 
they were pocketing their salaries. They told the Kuwaitis, 'You don't have to 
do anything. We'll do it for you.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's one lesson we have learned. We have to do the work ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Of the nearly 2 million people living in Kuwait at the time of the invasion, 
more than half were foreigners. Egyptians were teachers and engineers; 
Palestinians and Jordanians staffed offices and Filipinos, Indians, Pakistanis 
and other Asians swept the streets, built the roads and tended the children and 
houses of the middle class and the rich. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabahs had developed a society with themselves at the top. Jabbar has ruled 
by decree with Parliament disbanded -- and foreigners in the middle and at the 
bottom. Many of the other Kuwaitis, particularly Sabah cousins, had little to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are pampered," the American wife of a Kuwaiti said. "It's not good 
for them, and it's not good for their marriages." 
</P>
<P>
The Sabah family has ruled in Kuwait for more than 200 years, in this century 
alternating the emirship between the descendants of Jabbar and Salem, sons of 
Sheik Mubarak al Sabah, "Mubarak the Great," emir from 1896 to 1915. 
</P>
<P>
Oil, discovered in 1938, turned Kuwait from a relatively prosperous trading and 
pearling port into a gold mine. There were no worries about politics until 
independence from Britain in 1961. Two years later, the first National Assembly 
was elected. It lasted 13 years and was dissolved by the ruling Sabah, who said 
it had "exploited democracy and frozen most legislation in order to achieve 
private gain." 
</P>
<P>
The legislature was revived by the present ruler, Jabbar, in 1981, in the 
perilous months after the outbreak of war between Iraq and Iran, both of which 
coveted the strategic territory of Kuwait. But parliamentary politics again 
proved too quarrelsome for the Sabahs, and the assembly was dissolved again in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always had our differences in Kuwait," the former official said, 
remarking on the pro-democracy movement that blossomed in the absence of a 
legislature. "But we've always come out for Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
He and other Kuwaitis and diplomats note that the Iraqi regime attempted to 
draw leading members of the democracy movement into a puppet government after 
Iraq's invasion. The leader of the movement, Ahmed Saadoun, a former speaker of 
the assembly, flatly refused and reportedly was put under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution authorizing the multinational force confronting Iraq has 
demanded the restoration of the Sabahs, "the legitimate government of Kuwait." 
If that happens, some diplomats believe the family's hold on power may end 
quickly, although they do not expect an end to the emirship. 
</P>
<P>
"The system would not change," one said. "The tribes (large, powerful families) 
are too strong in Kuwait. But the Sabahs might be gone in a few months." 
</P>
<P>
Other outsiders argue that Jabbar, under pressure for political rigidity, might 
step aside for his cousin, the popular crown prince and prime minister, Sheik 
Saad al Abdullah al Sabah, who comes from the Salem line of the family. 
</P>
<P>
Even Kuwaitis agree that if they can get their country back, there will be 
political changes, with a larger voice for the assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be elections, there will be a parliament," said the former 
official, a pro-palace man. "But we want our emir and his crown prince. 
Everyone wants them back. Even the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ONE-FAMILY RULE 
</P>
<P>
 The Sabah family, which has ruled Kuwait for more than 200 years, originated 
in Najd province in what is now central Saudi Arabia. In this century, the 
emirship has alternated between the descendants of Jaber and Salem, sons of 
Sheik Mubarak al Sabah, or "Mubarak the Great," who was emir from 1896 to 1915. 
Here are the members of the Sabah family who held high government posts when 
Iraq invaded Kuwait. All have the title of sheik:

A HISTORIC GATEWAY IS BEING REOPENED;

IMMIGRATION: A NEW NATIONAL MUSEUM ON NEW YORK'S ELLIS ISLAND COMMEMORATES THE 
MILLIONS WHO HELPED MAKE AMERICA A MELTING POT.

<P>
For the millions of immigrants whose first stop on American soil was at Ellis 
Island, the experience was often frightening and bewildering. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was herded like cattle into a great big building," recalled 
84-year-old Ellen W. Pierce of Covina, Calif., a retired school teacher who 
came to America from England with her family in 1920. "We saw several families 
who were split up. My brother and sister were hungry and crying for something 
to eat." 
</P>
<P>
Now, 36 years after the last immigrant was processed through the tiny island in 
New York Harbor, the one-time gateway to America is reopening with a new 
national museum commemorating what has been called the largest human migration 
in modern history. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Vice President Dan Quayle will stand on Ellis Island and dedicate 
the new museum, which is housed in the same majestic red-brick building with 
limestone trim and copper-domed turrets that served as the island's processing 
center for more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
Known officially as the Ellis Island Immigration Museum, the remodeled national 
landmark is the culmination of an eight-year, $345-million restoration project 
that included the refurbishing of the nearby Statue of Liberty and is said to 
be the largest of its kind in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the four-day, $36-million patriotic extravaganza that marked the 
reopening of Miss Liberty in 1986, however, the dedication of the Ellis Island 
museum will be decidely shorter and more subdued. 
</P>
<P>
"It's deliberately so," says Stephen Briganti, president of the Statue of 
Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, a private association spearheading the 
restorations. "You can only do one Liberty Weekend in a lifetime. We 
deliberately are making this a very thoughtful, serious and, we hope, joyful 
celebration -- but on a much lower scale." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush had originally been scheduled to be the keynote speaker. But he 
was forced to cancel his appearance because of a meeting in Helsinki arranged 
just this week with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss the 
Persian Gulf crisis and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed that George Bush won't make it, but Ellis Island is a great 
symbol of our past, and the President, at this point, has to be concerned with 
our present and our future," Briganti said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to speeches by Quayle and Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan 
Jr., the Sunday ceremonies will include musical selections from around the 
world, dramatic readings evocative of the immigrant experience and the 
swearing-in of 50 new American citizens by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin 
Scalia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited. It's my first trip back to Ellis Island since landing there when 
I was 14," said Pierce, the retired Covina school teacher, who is among 180 
Ellis Island immigrants selected by lottery to attend the event as guests. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the 100,000-square-foot museum will be opened to the public and is 
expected to draw between 1 million and 1.5 million visitors annually -- about 
half the number that visit the Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors at Ellis will be able to relive a poignant part of what the millions 
of immigrants who passed through here experienced, stepping off a ferry at the 
same spot at which they debarked and viewing the Manhattan skyline from the 
same vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the museum, exhibits, films, artifacts and taped oral histories will 
tell the story of the people who came to America's shores from elsewhere -- 
including the millions of Africans who were brought here forcibly as slaves. 
</P>
<P>
"The exhibits in this museum put Ellis Island into the context of its time and 
the broader context of immigration to America over 400 years," said Gary G. 
Roth, National Park Service project manager for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, a 27.5-acre parcel of land situated about a mile off the Battery, served 
as an immigration processing point from 1892 to 1954. More than 17 million 
immigrants passed through here, the bulk of them between the late 1800s and 
early 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
The average immigrant spent three to five hours on the island, undergoing among 
other things a rigorous medical examination in which eyelids were raised to 
check for trachoma, a contagious eye disease, and scalps were examined for 
favus, a fungus infection. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kept on Ellis Island for eight months because I had favus," recalled 
Bessie Akawie, 80, of Los Angeles, who came to America in 1921 with her mother 
and five siblings from Russia. "I might have been deported if my father, who 
had come to America earlier, hadn't taken two jobs so he could pay for me to 
stay until I was cured." 
</P>
<P>
After the federal government closed down the immigration station, the island 
and its more than 30 buildings fell into neglect and disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of restoring the main building, the only one on Ellis refurbished so 
far, was $156 million. 
</P>
<P>
All the money for both the Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty restorations was 
raised from private donors, Briganti said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a symbol of what the American people can do through private initiative 
when they are properly organized and want to get a job done," he added.

SOVIET FEARS IMPERIL CONVENTIONAL FORCES PACT; 
</P>
<P>
ARMS CONTROL: MOSCOW IS WORRIED ABOUT CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE AND THE HUGE 
U.S. MILITARY BUILDUP IN THE PERSIAN GULF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S.-Soviet plan to complete the treaty slashing the superpowers' 
conventional forces in Europe by the end of the year is being jeopardized 
almost at the last minute by concerns in Moscow over the rapid changes in 
Eastern Europe and the massive American military buildup in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Gulf crisis and new problems that have developed in the 
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, the treaty on conventional forces will be on 
the agenda when President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet 
Sunday in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin, responding to the changes in Eastern Europe, wants to reopen 
negotiations over how many U.S. and Soviet troops could remain in Europe, 
Administration officials say -- a move that may derail the whole treaty on 
conventional forces in Europe unless Bush and Gorbachev resolve the problem at 
the summit meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Final agreement on the treaty is further complicated by concern among Soviet 
military leaders that CFE, as the agreement on conventional forces in Europe is 
known, could prevent them from concentrating troops in southern Russia to 
balance the U.S. buildup in the gulf, only about 700 miles from the Soviet 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev have publicly pledged to complete the treaty by the end of 
this year. And the crucial question of how many troops each superpower would be 
entitled to deploy in Europe was supposedly settled last February. 
</P>
<P>
But now, with Moscow's newly independent satellite nations demanding speedy 
withdrawal of Soviet troops from their territory, Kremlin leaders realize that 
they will soon be unable to deploy even the scaled-down forces permitted under 
the CFE agreement. As a result, they want to negotiate still lower limits on 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Gen. Vladimir N. Lobov, commander of Warsaw Pact forces, recently 
issued a public warning that the U.S. military buildup in the Mideast could 
jeopardize the CFE talks. Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. 
Gerasimov quickly denied that the Kremlin shares Lobov's fears about the 
buildup. There was "no direct link" between the arms talks and the Persian Gulf 
crisis, Gerasimov said. But Lobov's comments indicate a split within the Soviet 
government on the issue that could impede progress toward completing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department is also interested in re-examining the question of 
exactly how many troops each side could keep in Europe. Some Pentagon officials 
see such renewed negotiations as an opportunity to get higher ceilings for U.S. 
forces on the periphery of Europe, where they could be more useful in Mideast 
and other Third World crises. 
</P>
<P>
But sources said these Pentagon officials are out of step with other U.S. 
agencies and will not prevail over State Department and White House officials, 
who believe that reopening the complex issue of troop ceilings would hopelessly 
delay CFE. 
</P>
<P>
Already, some arms control experts fear that the gulf crisis is distracting the 
White House from arms control issues just as the intense "end games" of both 
negotiations demand close attention. 
</P>
<P>
Spurgeon M. Keeny Jr., director of the private Arms Control Assn., complained 
that the crisis "could easily result in extended delay" of both arms 
negotiations, which have seen little progress since the last U.S.-Soviet summit 
meeting in June. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Moscow agreed to a ceiling of 195,000 men each for the U.S. and 
Soviet forces in Central Europe, plus another 30,000 men for the United States 
on the Continent's periphery. 
</P>
<P>
But Moscow now recognizes that it will be unable to keep 195,000 men in Eastern 
Europe. Its 400,000-man force now in East Germany will be removed in less than 
four years, and its troops in the other former satellites will be gone by 
mid-1991. As a result, it wants to impose greater limits on U.S. forces in 
Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
An excuse to reopen the manpower question was found in the Soviet-West German 
agreement in July to limit a unified German army to 370,000 men. With that 
ceiling, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III in Irkutsk, Siberia, last month, fewer U.S. and Soviet 
forces would be justified in Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, for its part, wants to increase the 30,000-troop ceiling on U.S. 
forces on the European periphery -- in Britain and in NATO nations along the 
Mediterranean -- to about 50,000, sources said. If it cannot win such an 
increase, the Pentagon would settle for a joint ceiling for all of Europe, in 
which it would have greater flexibility to move forces around the Continent as 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
The other major outstanding issue in CFE, officials said, is limits on numbers 
and kinds of aircraft. The Soviets have recently moved closer to the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization position on limits but major differences remain. 
Similarly, the United States wants to constrain land-based Soviet aircraft that 
are capable of attacking U.S. warships, whereas the Soviets want to constrain 
U.S. carrier-based aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The disagreement may be dealt with by putting aside the aircraft issue until 
follow-up negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
So far as efforts to complete the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty are 
concerned, the major political issue -- a "treaty buster," in arms control 
jargon -- that could require resolution at the Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting is 
a Soviet effort to halt U.S. cooperation with Britain's nuclear weapons 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials maintain that Bush would rather forgo a START treaty than end 
the Anglo-American partnership on nuclear weapons. Officials hope Bush will 
tell Gorbachev to give up that effort. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat lesser difficulties involve flight-testing of the massive Soviet SS-18 
missiles and continuous on-site monitoring posts at missile production 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the Soviets seemed ready to accept any kind of inspection regime, but 
now they prefer that no new posts be created beyond the one set up by each side 
under the existing intermediate-range missile treaty to keep tabs on production 
of those weapons.

Six-power talks about German unification bogged down Thursday in fine-print 
disputes over withdrawing Soviet forces and restoring full German sovereignty, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation sources said the Soviet Union was resisting not only setting a 
firm date for pulling 370,000 troops out of East Germany but also was 
renouncing Allied occupation rights on Oct. 3, when the two Germanys are to 
merge.

Senior officials of East and West Germany and the four World War II Allies -- 
the United States, Soviet Union, France and Britain -- were meeting to wrap up 
the text of an accord to be signed by their foreign ministers in Moscow next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The "two-plus-four" conference in East Berlin, which began Tuesday, was 
originally expected to be completed in two days but it was extended at least 
until today after hitting snags.

It was the second time in a week that opposition parties have been prevented

May after unprecedented unrest in this West African nation, but authorities 
have often refused the parties permission to hold rallies.

NASA TRACES SHUTTLE'S LEAK TO A PUMP; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: THE LAUNCHING OF COLUMBIA AND ITS ASTRO OBSERVATORY MAY BE DELAYED 
AGAIN. IT WILL DEPEND ON THE TIMING OF THE DISCOVERY MISSION.

<P>
The launching of the shuttle Columbia was thrown into confusion Thursday as 
NASA engineers traced the source of the hydrogen leak that postponed 
Wednesday's liftoff to a recirculating pump in the shuttle's aft engine 
compartment. 
</P>
<P>
The space agency will replace the pump, delaying Columbia's launching with the 
Astro observatory until at least early in the week of Sept. 17. But the craft 
may not get off the ground until much later than that. 
</P>
<P>
Because NASA normally requires a three-week interval between launchings, this 
will bring the agency too close to the scheduled Oct. 5 launching of the 
shuttle Discovery with the high-priority Ulysses probe. 
</P>
<P>
There is a possibility, however, that the Discovery launching will also be 
delayed by three or four days to repair a recently discovered leak in the 
ship's Freon cooling loop. This would enable NASA to launch Columbia on the 
17th and still have the required three weeks in which to prepare Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the one shot we have to safely get the Astro mission airborne" before 
Discovery, NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly said Thursday. But, if lengthy 
repairs to Discovery are not required and it appears that it can make the Oct. 
5 date, added associate administrator William B. Lenoir, the Columbia mission 
will have to wait until after the launching of Ulysses. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Oct. 5, the space agency has only an 18-day window to launch Discovery 
because the Ulysses probe must perform a slingshot maneuver around Jupiter to 
go into a polar orbit around the sun. If it isn't launched during that period, 
NASA must wait 13 months until the planets are again in the proper alignment. 
</P>
<P>
Space shuttle director Robert L. Crippen had said earlier that technicians here 
would perform a fueling test on Discovery before liftoff to ensure that it too 
does not have a hydrogen leak, a process that would add another five days to 
its preparation time before launching. 
</P>
<P>
But in a Thursday afternoon press conference, Lenoir said that he believed the 
leak in the recirculating Columbia's pump is a one-of-a-kind problem rather 
than a generic one and that the fueling test on Discovery would not be 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The recirculating pump, about the size of a portable television set, pumps 
liquid hydrogen fuel through the shuttle's three rocket engines to cool them 
before launching. Otherwise, they would receive a damaging thermal shock when 
the supercold fuel begins flowing through them at ignition. The pump is turned 
off after ignition and the fuel flows by gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Physically replacing the pump and checking it will take only about two days 
once the process is begun Saturday, said Bob Sieck, launching director. The 
rest of the time will be used for normal countdown operations. Lenoir said that 
Columbia could possibly be launched before the 17th, but that it is "unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
Lenoir said that the leak was definitely not in the 17-inch "disconnect" valve 
that connects the massive external fuel tank to the shuttle. That valve was the 
source of a hydrogen leak that forced NASA to scrub both an attempted launching 
of Columbia on May 29 and a July launching of the shuttle Atlantis and led 
Truly to ground the entire shuttle fleet. 
</P>
<P>
When engineers at Rockwell International in Downey disassembled that valve, 
they found that it was contaminated by microscopic glass beads that prevented a 
tight seal from being formed. Lenoir said that technicians had just 
disassembled another "disconnect" valve from the same batch of eight and found 
that it was also contaminated by the beads, suggesting that there was a problem 
with the entire batch. 
</P>
<P>
Lenoir said there is evidence that at least one of the valves was in the same 
building where its manufacturer, Parker-Hannifin of Irvine, used the glass 
beads in a project unrelated to the space program. The agency will not use any 
of the other "disconnect" valves from that batch, he said, and "we think we no 
longer have a problem (with it)." 
</P>
<P>
The new problems with Discovery and Columbia have capped what Truly called "a 
troublesome and vexing summer." In addition to the shuttle grounding, the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration has suffered through the 
discovery of a design flaw in the mirror of its showpiece Hubble Space 
Telescope, intense criticism about its plans for Space Station Freedom and the 
temporary loss of contact with the Magellan probe that is now orbiting Venus. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of another hydrogen leak has brought more predictable criticism 
of the troubled agency. Typical were the remarks of Robert Hotz, a member of 
the commission that investigated the 1986 Challenger explosion that killed 
seven crew members: "We discovered three years ago that NASA does not 
understand the problems of repetitive flying. The shuttle is just too 
complicated a bird." 
</P>
<P>
But Truly countered that the agency was doing its best and that flying the 
shuttle "is not an ordinary business."

An armed high school sophomore held up to 40 schoolmates hostage for more than 
five hours Thursday, releasing some in exchange for candy and soda before 
growing dizzy and surrendering, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured during the ordeal at the combined South Forsyth high school 
and middle school in Forsyth County, about 40 miles north of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the school's 1,200 students were evacuated, and hundreds of worried 
parents flocked to the campus as word of the incident spread. 
</P>
<P>
Forsyth County Sheriff Wesley Walraven said the youth, identified as 
10th-grader Randy Addis, pulled a rifle in Don Hutchins' civics class and fired 
it over the students' heads. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Tallant, who was teaching in the next room, struggled with Addis and got 
the rifle away from him, but not before another shot was fired, the sheriff 
said. Addis then ran, Hutchins tackled him, and the youth pulled out a shotgun, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, armed with the shotgun and a pistol, ordered Hutchins' students into 
Tallant's classroom and held both classes -- about 40 students -- at gunpoint, 
Walraven said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students were released gradually during the morning, including all 
of the girls but one, who chose to stay because she knew Addis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some hostages were freed in exchange for candy and soda, said Joyce Shadburn, a 
spokeswoman for the county's school superintendent. Addis demanded a school bus 
also, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Walraven said the youth demanded the bus to take him to Savannah, and $3,000 in 
cash. But Addis began to get dizzy, and two of the hostages ran out, the 
sheriff said. Officers moved in to take his weapons, and he did not resist. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh-grader Shawn Abercrombie, whose older brother was among the hostages, 
described Addis as "a quiet guy. He has problems and has seizures and takes 
pills for them." 
</P>
<P>
The youth had a seizure last week, Abercrombie said.

CPR EFFORT PARTLY BLAMED IN DEATH OF ELDERLY MAN

Emergency workers who were trying to save an 80-year-old man's life after a 
heart attack accidentally contributed to his death, the Ventura County Medical 
Examiner's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph W. Brockmann died after emergency medical workers crushed his ribs and 
tore his heart while trying to revive him with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 
according to an autopsy by Assistant Medical Examiner Ronald L. O'Halloran. 
</P>
<P>
Two Ventura firefighters had administered CPR on Brockmann after the car he was 
driving crossed into oncoming traffic and collided with another car on East 
Main Street in Ventura, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Brockmann continued to receive CPR at Ventura County Medical Center, where he 
was pronounced dead nearly two hours after the Tuesday morning accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody tried to save his life, and during the process there was a tear in 
his heart," O'Halloran said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Halloran said Brockmann, who had been suffering from heart disease, had a 
heart attack before or during the accident and that he probably would have died 
from the accident. Brockmann, who also suffered broken ribs during the CPR 
efforts, had Paget's disease, which makes bones brittle. 
</P>
<P>
CPR, an emergency procedure that involves applying pressure to the chest to 
keep blood pumping to the lungs and brain, is used as a last-ditch measure to 
revive heart attack victims. 
</P>
<P>
Medical and emergency officials say it often results in broken ribs and bones 
but rarely is the primary cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the heart attack, O'Halloran said, "His chances of surviving were 
almost zero." 
</P>
<P>
"It was listed as a natural death; the underlying cause of death was a heart 
attack," O'Halloran said. Brockmann was wearing his seat belt when the accident 
occurred, Ventura police Lt. Don Arth said. Police are continuing to 
investigate the cause of the accident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's officials would not release the name of the emergency workers who 
administered the CPR to Brockmann. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Carriger, Ventura Fire Department operations chief, said the two 
firefighters who administered aid to Brockmann at the accident scene were 
convinced it was the only way to save the man's life. Brockmann's heart had 
stopped and he was not breathing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When CPR was initiated, the man was clinically dead," Carriger said. The two 
firefighters followed proper procedures under the direction of a paramedic who 
had been dispatched by Courtesy Ambulance Service, Carriger said. 
</P>
<P>
CPR continued while Brockmann was taken to the hospital and was resumed by 
emergency room workers at Ventura County Medical Center, Carriger said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Brodfuehrer, administrator of the county Emergency Medical Services, 
which oversees training for ambulance crews and firefighters, said all Ventura 
firefighters receive extensive training to administer CPR. 
</P>
<P>
CPR is commonly used by paramedics and firefighters to save accident victims' 
lives, but they know it carries some measure of risk, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Brockmann's son said the family did not blame emergency medical workers for the 
death. 
</P>
<P>
"It's emergency work, and it's a desperate measure for a desperate situation," 
said Brockmann's son, Joseph Brockmann Jr. "I want to emphasize that there is 
no anger, and I want to find the fireman who did it and make sure he 
understands that." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Brockmann had worked with the New York Telephone Co. before moving to 
Ventura nearly 10 years ago, Brockmann's son said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Brockmann Sr. had prepared for emergencies by placing a list of 
emergency phone numbers next to his bed, with the request "Use No Heroic 
Measures" written at the top. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as it hurts to have him gone, it's not the tragedy people may make it 
out to be," Brockmann Jr. said. "The coroner felt if he would have lived, he 
would have been in real bad shape."

The county's air in August, which is usually the smoggiest month of the year, 
violated federal health standards on only three days, all in Simi Valley, the 
county's smoggiest city. In July, county air was unhealthful on only two days, 
twice in Simi Valley and once in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the county's air has violated the federal standards on only nine days 
so far this year. Simi Valley accounted for eight of the days, with the 
county's coastline escaping smog violation days completely. 
</P>
<P>
The summer smog season lasts from May to October. Typically, low clouds and 
warm inversion layers trap pollutants near the ground, and there are 40 to 60 
smoggy days in the county, said Herman Ragsdale, air quality specialist at the 
Air Pollution Control District's data center. About 80% of the smoggy days, 
which are defined in terms of ozone levels, usually occur before September. 
Preliminary figures for 1989 show that there were 16 smog violation days in 
July and two in August. 
</P>
<P>
"But even if we have a typical September and October, we will still have the 
cleanest year," Ragsdale said. "We would not expect more than about 15 smoggy 
days in September and October, and that would still put us at half the norm." 
</P>
<P>
However, late September and October typically bring warm Santa Ana winds that 
blow pollutants in from the Simi and San Fernando valleys, district 
meteorologist Kent Field said. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is not a typical year," Field said. 
</P>
<P>
Field said new Air Pollution Control District regulations have reduced 
emissions in recent years but deserve only a small part of the credit for the 
unusually clean air. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen a drastic reduction in emissions," he said. "No, this air is 
due to the weather." 
</P>
<P>
Unusual weather patterns this summer have brought light winds and weak, dry 
inversion layers that do not trap pollutants, he said. That has allowed the 
pollutants that cause ozone to disperse into the air, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Field said he could not predict if the weather patterns that have kept ozone 
levels to a minimum will hold through September and October. 
</P>
<P>
The same exceptionally low smog levels have prevailed in the sprawling South 
Coast Air Quality Management District, which includes Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties, district reports show. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD does not measure smog in terms of unhealthful days. Instead, it 
measures federal health standard violations at 26 monitoring stations in the 
area. Thus, many stations might have violations on a given day. The South Coast 
District recorded 1,798 ozone violations from May through July. There were 
3,283 such violations in all of 1989 and 3,416 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone, a primary ingredient of smog, is formed when nitrogen oxide reacts with 
hydrocarbons in sunlight. Motor vehicles in Ventura County account for more 
than half the nitrogen oxide in the air, and Southern California Edison's power 
plants and the oil industry produce about 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicles produce more than 40% of hydrocarbons and are the largest single 
source. But engines used by the oil industry for pumping as well as industrial 
and agriculture solvents combine to produce 55% of hydrocarbons in Ventura 
County's air. 
</P>
<P>
Air Pollution Control District regulations have forced a 25% to 30% decrease in 
emissions over the past 10 years that has steadily improved air quality, 
district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Baldwin, the county's top air pollution control official, said emission 
levels are expected to continue to decrease gradually until the county meets 
federal clean air standards sometime in 10 to 20 years. The federal government 
sets the health standard at .12 parts per million of ozone. 
</P>
<P>
State guidelines, which are stricter, say that any ozone concentration above 
.09 parts per million is unhealthful. A first-stage smog alert is called when 
ozone concentrations hit .20. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone is an irritant that attacks the respiratory system and can cause lung 
tissue damage, according to the American Lung Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin warned that the clean-air summer of 1990 could change drastically with 
weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had a horrible heat wave, we could still have poor air quality. The only 
difference is that it would have been worse without the emission reductions," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County has never had second- or third-stage smog alerts, which are more 
severe than first-stage alerts, but it did have three days of first-stage 
alerts in April. It was the first time in eight years the county had had a smog 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
In that unusual episode, winds pushed polluted air over the ocean. A low 
inversion layer trapped the air mass and the sun baked it for four days. When 
the hot Santa Ana winds cooled, other winds kicked in and blew the pollution 
back over Ventura, causing a dim gray film to settle over the coast. 
</P>
<P>
The dirty air mass later moved east into Simi Valley, where it backed up 
against hills that surround the valley and caused smog alerts there.

LAGOMARSINO IS A NO-SHOW AT FORUM; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE EVENT'S ORGANIZER AND THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN'S CHIEF RIVAL 
CRITICIZE HIS ABSENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) declined to meet his two challengers at 
a candidates forum in Ventura Thursday night, angering the event's organizer. 
</P>
<P>
Reb Wayne, chairman of Lagomarsino's reelection campaign, said he was not aware 
of any commitment to attend the forum. Although Lagomarsino is in Ventura this 
week, official duties prevented him from attending the forum, Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne said the congressman is not avoiding a face-off with Anita Perez 
Ferguson, his Democratic challenger, or Mindy Lorenz, a write-in candidate 
representing the fledgling Green Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob has always debated his opponents and there will be debates," Wayne said. 
He suggested that debates will be held in October. 
</P>
<P>
But Lagomarsino's decision left bruised feelings at the National Council of 
Jewish Women, which sponsored the event. Florence Yosnow, legislative 
chairwoman of the group, said Lagomarsino's staff had twice assured her that 
the congressmen would attend or send a representative. 
</P>
<P>
"Since they told us on two occasions that they would come, I was disappointed 
that they pulled out at the last moment," Yosnow said. "Wouldn't you be upset?" 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson thanked the 70 people who congregated at Temple Beth Torah for making 
the effort to participate in the candidates' forum, a longtime tradition. 
During most of her alloted time, she attacked Lagomarsino for a lack of 
leadership in Washington, which she said was made evident Thursday night by his 
conspicuous absence. 
</P>
<P>
"If Congressman Lagomarsino was here tonight, I would ask him why he is not 
paying more attention to the health-care system," Ferguson told the crowd that 
included many elderly residents. "He is not here tonight in large measure 
because he has failed, not only on health care, but on a wide range of issues." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne said he only learned of the candidates forum recently and didn't know who 
on Lagomarsino's staff would have agreed to send a representative to such a 
meeting. "Bob does not allow surrogates to act in his behalf at candidate 
forums or debates," he said. "He feels that only Bob Lagomarsino can speak for 
Bob Lagomarsino." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Carter, Lagomarsino's top aide in the district, said he is in charge of the 
congressman's schedule here and he had never spoken to Yosnow. He said the 
congressman never intended to participate in the forum and blamed the Ferguson 
campaign for trying to stir up trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is apparent that they are trying to create a controversy where 
there isn't one," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
In any future debate, Lagomarsino will insist on a wide-ranging discussion that 
would draw an audience from across the political spectrum, Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to do debates and if we use a sponsor, we want one that is going to 
have a broad appeal," Wayne said. He said the Lagomarsino campaign wants to 
avoid debates or other campaign meetings sponsored by groups with "their own 
agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Rodriguez, Ferguson's campaign manager, said he was not buying Wayne's 
explanation for Lagomarsino's absence Thursday and refusal to send a surrogate. 
"In 1988, he sent surrogate speakers numerous times to campaign events," 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson decided to address the group Thursday even though her chief opponent 
failed to show. "The issues need to be debated with him or without him," 
Rodriguez said.

GIRL SAYS TEACHER STARED AT HER; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: TRIAL BEGINS FOR A CAMARILLO INSTRUCTOR ACCUSED OF MAKING SEXUAL 
COMMENTS TO STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Camarillo High School senior testified Thursday that her drama teacher often 
stared at her short clothing and once asked her if she "put out." 
</P>
<P>
William H. Fisher went on trial Thursday on charges that he inappropriately 
hugged or made sexual comments to eight of his former students. Fisher is 
charged with eight misdemeanor counts under a state law that makes it a crime 
to "annoy or molest a child under 18." 
</P>
<P>
During her opening statement in Ventura County Municipal Court, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Kathleen O'Brien told jurors that they would hear the girls testify that 
Fisher, 42, made sexual innuendoes that "were motivated by an unnatural sexual 
interest" in children. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney George Eskin said defense witnesses would testify that 
Fisher "complimented them, male and female, on their appearance. He tried to 
help shy and self-conscious students gain confidence about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Eskin said that the evidence will show that no molestation occurred and that 
Fisher committed no crime. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher has been suspended from his position pending the trial's outcome. Last 
June, some of his former students rallied around him at a court hearing, saying 
they did not believe the charges. Fisher had pleaded guilty to four counts but 
changed his plea to not guilty after learning that he could be sentenced to 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the 17-year-old girl testified that in the spring of 1989 Fisher 
asked her to step outside a classroom and model her tight black miniskirt for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"He goes, 'Hey, come here, I want to see that outfit on you,' " the girl 
testified. "He told me to turn around a couple times, he said, 'Yeah, I like 
that. I like it when you wear tight clothes.' I felt insulted after he made 
that comment, so I just turned around and left." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher watched the girl intently during her testimony. She kept her eyes on 
O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
The girl testified that Fisher once led her by the hand to the school's theater 
alone. He turned off most of the lights and sat at the back of the darkened 
theater, asking her to walk around on stage under the spotlights to model the 
white miniskirt she had worn to school, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher then said he wanted to take her to the beach to see how she looked in a 
bikini, she testified. He invited her to exercise with him at his house, she 
told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I'd love to take you out some time, but I don't think that the 
school administration would approve of student-teacher association,' " she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Once, the girl testified, Fisher pointed to her miniskirt, tank top and 
high-heeled boots. "He said that a lot of girls dress provocative, but they 
don't put out and he asked me if I did," she said. "I didn't say anything." 
</P>
<P>
The girl said she often "ditched" Fisher's drama class during the spring of 
1989 to avoid being near him. In the fall of 1989, she testified, she was 
mistakenly enrolled in his class again and tried unsuccessfully to transfer 
out. During the fall term, she said, Fisher left her alone. 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination, Eskin asked the girl how a favorable comment about 
her appearance would insult rather than flatter her. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming from an older man, it's not a compliment," the girl said. "It made me 
feel uncomfortable, but there was nothing I could do because he was my 
teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Eskin asked whether she had misinterpreted Fisher. "Wasn't he trying to warn 
you that if you dressed that way people might think you were loose?" Eskin 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No, he did not say it that way," the girl said. "He said, 'Do you put out?' " 
</P>
<P>
The girl and a 15-year-old classmate testified that Fisher showed each of them 
photographs from an old stage production called "Sweet Travesty," in which he 
wore women's clothing and asked what they thought. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old testified that Fisher promised to help her get modeling work. 
She said he took her to the school theater and had her try on dresses that he 
claimed belonged to his girlfriend, including one with a lace top that she was 
told to wear with no bra. 
</P>
<P>
Each charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
Testimony continues today and is expected to last up to two weeks.

EVICTED WOMAN SELLS DUPLEX FOR $135,000

<P>
A Camarillo resident who became homeless after city officials evicted her from 
her decaying house, filled with trash up to the ceilings, sold the duplex for 
$135,500, city officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Kelton Roberts, 64, took to the streets after her house was declared a health 
hazard about 20 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
City officials removed about 100 tons of garbage that had begun to fester and 
mold in her home. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who says her obsessive compulsive disorder makes her unable to throw 
anything away, was not happy about the sale. "It's sold and it's over and now 
I'm unhappy. I never wanted to sell it," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts attends counseling and takes medication for her disorder, but she said 
it has not relieved her problem. 
</P>
<P>
Salvador Plascencia, who bought the property, plans to rent it out after 
renovating it, real estate agent Mike Takusagawa said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said she is not sure what she will do with the money but may buy a 
mobile home. LAURA PITTER

ONLY IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Harvey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when L.A. was making pretensions to becoming a cosmopolitan city -- 
building a large Pacific Rim trade, erecting a 73-story skyscraper, acquiring a 
Van Gogh -- it took Police Chief Daryl F. Gates to keep us rooted with our 
frontier past. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who said Wednesday that pot-smokers "ought to be taken out and shot," is 
the latest in a long line of colorful, tough-talking chiefs of this pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
James (Two-Gun) Davis and Roy (Strongarm Dick) Steckel, for instance, were two 
LAPD bosses who often found themselves in the limelight in the 1920s and 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who liked to say that constitutional rights were of "no benefit to 
anybody but crooks and criminals," was responsible for the so-called Bum 
Blockade, stationing officers at the eastern border of the state during the 
Depression to turn back Dust Bowl immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Author Bruce Henstell ("Sunshine and Wealth") notes that Steckel's men once 
claimed to have found a kidnaped boy and, when the mother said he was not her 
missing son, "the police insisted he was, and that she take him and try him 
out." The mother subsequently was proved correct. Steckel was later demoted. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, of course, when Ed Davis was chief, he asserted that airline 
hijackers should be hanged at the airport. Gates, who has pondered running for 
political office, might have been trying to emulate his predecessor. After all, 
Davis has since been elected to the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
How's this for juxtaposition? One day after Gates' scattershot remarks, the 
L.A. City Council approved an LAPD plan to pay a consultant $99,600 to teach 
police officers how to defuse tense situations and avoid violent 
confrontations. It's called "verbal judo." 
</P>
<P>
The winner of our weekly Dueling Signs competition -- it's a three-way duel -- 
was submitted by Linda Mann of Northridge. Fortunately, the signs don't 
confront motorists, only visitors walking through the Andres Pico Adobe in 
Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Curator Elva Meline says the threesome is on display as a reminder of the era 
when each was a stagecoach trail leading to the nearby San Fernando Mission. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, streets with those names exist in the Antelope Valley -- but not 
in such close proximity.

Even some of the bad guys seem to be practicing water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, someone stole one of the sprinklers set out overnight by Charlie 
Turner, the 85-year-old caretaker who's trying to revive Dante's View, the 
burned-out garden spot on Mt. Hollywood. The water was running at the time. The 
thief tied the hose into a knot, shutting off the flow.

the residents, comes from somewhere else (it's a native of South Africa).

Ojai Valley equestrians, saddened by the death of a popular horseshoer, will 
hold a benefit dinner for his widow and two children Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Peter A. Heindl, 35, of Santa Barbara died Aug. 30 of abdominal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
A farrier for seven years, he had clients throughout Southern California and 
managed to keep shoeing their horses even after his medical treatments began, 
said his wife, Terry Heindl. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete was friends with just about everybody," said Gary Isbell, a fellow 
farrier in Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always full of stories and always had a joke, even after he found out 
he had cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"You would find him at sunup and sundown slinging that hammer, shoeing horses," 
Isbell said. 
</P>
<P>
The feed store is holding a $5-a-plate tri-tip or chicken barbecue from 5 to 6 
p.m. Saturday at William and Marie McTavish's Westwinds Ranch, 10562 Creek 
Road, Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the event will go to Heindl's family, including a daughter, 
Tabitha, 12, and a son, Travis, 10. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Davis, owner of Ojai Valley Feed in Meiners Oaks, said those who plan to 
attend the benefit are asked to bring their own beverage and call ahead at

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
COURTIN' CALIFORNIA BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California is not alone in its appreciation of what high housing 
prices, increasing congestion and high taxes can mean for the economic 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
While various states and even foreign nations have found fertile ground in 
California for recruiting businesses that seek to move to less expensive 
locales, Oklahoma has become the first state to open a full-time economic 
development office in this region. Gov. Harry L. Bellmon even showed up in 
Orange County this week to make the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
That's pretty ironic when you remember that in the 1930s, Depression-era 
frustration drove thousands of migrant workers to Southern California from the 
Dust Bowl, and provided inspiration for John Steinbeck. Today, far different 
economic conditions are prompting the opportunistic Sooners to entice 
businesses their way. 
</P>
<P>
The pot of gold in Oklahoma's rainbow is cheaper housing, lower corporate and 
personal income tax rates and less traffic. One Newport Beach oil-services firm 
has already moved. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lesson here for Southern California, which has prospered as a 
promised land for generations -- from Oklahoma and elsewhere. Today, the work 
that needs doing is not just to create new jobs but to make the area livable 
and affordable. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and Orange counties both had annual rates of growth in new 
employment of less than 2% last year. But Orange County, which enjoyed growth 
in the 6%-to-8% range during the late 1980s, has no economic development 
program. And while the city of Los Angeles has such a program, many people 
still can't get their share of the good life. UCLA professor James Johnson says 
that many discouraged black residents simply move away. 
</P>
<P>
Census figures do show people are still flocking to Southern California despite 
our problems. But the area also needs some comprehensive strategies. Otherwise, 
more California businesses may start whistling Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes.

Before judges, prosecutors and lawyers assembled in a courtroom of the federal 
courthouse in Los Angeles, the new U.S. attorney for the Central District of 
California, Lourdes G. Baird, was officially sworn into office on Thursday. 
Baird, 55, a native of Ecuador and a former Los Angeles County Superior Court 
judge, was nominated by President Bush last May to replace U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Robert C. Bonner. Taking into account Baird's Latino background and the fact 
that Southern California is an ethnic melting pot with a large Latino 
population, her former law partner, Molly Munger, said that "Lourdes is 
symbolic of Los Angeles." Baird, who raised a family before pursuing a legal 
career, gave credit to other women in her profession. "I clearly got here 
hanging on to the skirts of my predecessors," she said.

WESTERN'S STANDS STOP LOARA, 16-14

<P>
Western High School used two impressive second-quarter drives to build a 
10-point lead, then hung on in the final minute to defeat Loara, 16-14, 
Thursday at Western. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers, led by quarterback Gilbert Brito, held a 16-6 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Western made two impressive goal-line stands in the fourth quarter before Loara 
finally punched through on a 12-yard scoring pass from Charles Gipson to Scott 
Smith with 16 seconds left to play. 
</P>
<P>
A two-point conversion cut the deficit to 16-14, and Loara's hopes rested with 
recovering an onside kick. But Western's Shane Foss fell on the ball as time 
ran out. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured that was what it was going to come down to in the second half," 
Western Coach Jim Howell said. "You could just see it going that way." 
</P>
<P>
Loara stumbled at times because of turnovers. The Saxons, under first-year 
Coach John DeFries, fumbled three times and had a pass intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just hoping the kids would play well," DeFries said. "And they did in 
spots, but we learned and will get better." 
</P>
<P>
Western took a 3-0 lead on a 39-yard field goal by Brito with 3:27 left in the 
first quarter. The score was set up after Al Quinto recovered a Loara fumble at 
midfield. The drive stalled three plays later, but Brito completed a 16-yard 
pass to Al Villegas out of punt formation for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Western's offense got going after an interception by 
John Walder at the Pioneer 17. 
</P>
<P>
Brito led Western on an impressive, 73-yard, eight-play drive than ended with a 
four-yard touchdown run by Foss with 5:54 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Loara came back to score on a 24-yard pass from Gipson to fullback David Kang, 
who caught the pass in the flat and broke two tackles on the way to the end 
zone with 2:38 left. The score cut Western's lead to 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
Western scored again before the half with the help of a 41-yard kickoff return 
by Walder, giving the Pioneers the ball on the Loara 44 with 2:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
It took Western five plays to score, and this time it came on an eight-yard run 
by Foss with 21 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to finally block somebody on those two drives," Howell said. "We 
are a young team and the kids were a little scared at the start." 
</P>
<P>
Brito led the Western offense, passing for 140 yards. He was 10 of 20 with no 
interceptions. He also rushed for 47 yards, but was sacked five times and 
finished with just 10 net yards. 
</P>
<P>
Loara quarterback Gipson was 12 of 28 for 118 yards with two touchdowns and one 
interception.

TOUGH EDISON DEFENSE STOPS EL MODENA FOR 17-7 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
Except for the final 1 minute 27 seconds, Edison High School's football team 
played the kind of defense Coach Dave White expected. 
</P>
<P>
Edison, ranked eighth in Orange County, held unranked El Modena to 101 yards 
total offense until surrendering a late 64-yard touchdown drive in a 17-7 
victory Thursday night at El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (2-0) were headed for their second consecutive shutout until 
backup quarterback Jose Prado fueled El Modena's only touchdown drive in the 
final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards (0-1) recovered a muffed punt at their 36, and Prado threw to 
wide receiver Darryll Holguin for 47 yards to Edison's 17. Prado then passed to 
wide receiver Jay Montano for a 17-yard touchdown with seven seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"We had talked about the shutout and we were disappointed we didn't get it," 
White said. "It was a great lesson for us, though, because we let up. Before 
that (drive), we played pretty damn good defense." 
</P>
<P>
Prado entered the game after starting quarterback Adam Garcia separated his 
right throwing shoulder while making a tackle on defense. El Modena Coach Bill 
Backstrom said Garcia will be out as many as five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we're going to have to go with Prado at quarterback now," 
Backstrom said. "But don't underestimate him. He can catch the ball (five 
catches for 54 yards), kick and tackle. And I think he can throw the ball too." 
</P>
<P>
Backstrom said Edison's pass rush kept Garcia off-balance. He was sacked four 
times for 41 yards. Two key sacks came in the second half, both after El Modena 
had crossed Edison's 40-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept the pressure on us," Backstrom said. "Edison has a good defensive 
line and secondary. They're a bunch of little guys, but they're (very) quick." 
</P>
<P>
But defense wasn't all Edison had Thursday night. The offense got into the act 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Charger quarterback Josh Ginrich completed nine of 18 passes for 168 yards. 
Wide receiver Mike Cunningham caught six passes for 135 yards, including a 
two-yard touchdown pass with 1:32 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Running back J.R. Schusterick rushed for 74 yards in 17 carries and scored on a 
two-yard run with 8:32 remaining in the second quarter. Brent Hanson added a 
23-yard field goal with 1:27 left in the game to give Edison a 17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
White said the offense was "much improved" from last week, when it sputtered in 
a 12-0 win over Honolulu Iolani in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our line blocked a lot better this game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
White said Edison will have to put a complete game together next Friday, when 
it plays second-ranked Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We played 3 1/2 quarters worth of good defense tonight," White said. "But 
against Capo Valley and the teams in our league, we're going to have to play 
four quarters."

FOX NETWORK GETS CABLE AFFILIATES IN DEAL WITH TCI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tele-Communications Inc., the country's largest owner of cable TV systems, and 
Fox Broadcasting Co. have reached a preliminary agreement that would allow 
certain TCI franchises to become affiliates of the emerging fourth network. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is significant because it breaks a longstanding taboo against 
broadcast networks offering their programming directly to cable systems. Until 
now, the networks have only allowed their programming to be distributed on an 
exclusive basis to local TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Fox will give its programming to TCI systems that fall 
into rural so-called white areas, where there is no Fox affiliate. Fox reaches 
only 91% of the country, compared to 99% for the other three networks. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, TCI said, it would move the Fox signal to Channel 13 or below 
on its cable systems in order to boost viewing for the network. Fox has 134 
affiliates, but 117 of them are UHF stations usually carried on the less 
desirable upper band by local cable systems, which is believed to hold down 
viewership. 
</P>
<P>
John Malone, chief executive of TCI, called the agreement with Fox "precedent 
setting" because it gives local TCI cable systems "network affiliate status" in 
places where Fox programming is unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the customary arrangement with local broadcast affiliates -- which 
Fox pays to carry its programming -- TCI will pay Fox 6 cents per month per 
subscriber. TCI estimates that as many as 800,000 of its subscribers do not 
receive Fox because there is no affiliate in their area. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Kellner, president of the Fox network, said the goal is to position Fox 
on Channel 13 or below on all cable systems around the country. "The way we've 
done it with TCI is the way we want to do it with the rest of the industry." 
</P>
<P>
That is distressing news to ABC, CBS and NBC, which will face tougher 
competition from Fox as a result of the repositioning. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the TCI-Fox agreement appears to undermine the relationship 
between networks and their affiliates. The networks have long maintained that 
their programming contracts with affiliates are exclusive and their programming 
should not be seen anywhere else. Last June, NBC and CBS rejected unsolicited 
requests from TCI and Continental Cablevision Corp. seeking to affiliate with 
those networks in so-called white areas. 
</P>
<P>
Since NBC and CBS are in virtually every TV household in the country, however, 
the request was interpreted as a political ploy to illustrate the contradiction 
in the network position on program exclusivity. 
</P>
<P>
As part of actions in Congress to reregulate the cable TV industry, NBC heavily 
lobbied to include language that would compel cable networks such as HBO or 
ESPN to sell their programming to emerging competitive services, including 
satellite broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Current regulations protect cable networks from having to sell their 
programming to anybody other than cable systems. NBC is a partner in a 
satellite broadcasting service set to be launched in 1994, and the partners 
claim they need access to cable networks to make the venture viable. 
</P>
<P>
But TCI and the cable industry contended that if NBC wanted access to cable 
programming, the networks should also make themselves available to local cable 
TV systems. Cable systems could earn significantly more money if they were 
allowed to sell advertising sandwiched between network TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
Fox and TCI maintain that the only purpose of their agreement is to increase 
viewers of Fox programs and make those programs available to TCI subscribers 
who cannot receive a local Fox affiliate. But the action puts pressure on the 
networks, particularly NBC, to be less insistent in their demands that cable 
programming be sold to emerging and potentially competitive services.

REGULATORS BLAME COLUMBIA S&amp;L LOSS ON LAVISH BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators on Thursday alleged that former Columbia Savings &amp; Loan 
Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel caused the thrift to lose $29.2 million by 
building a lavish $54.7-million headquarters in Beverly Hills that was to have 
featured anti-terrorist bomb shelters in bathrooms, stainless steel floors and 
a multilevel gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations were added to earlier civil charges filed two months ago by the 
federal Office of Thrift Supervision against Spiegel, who headed the Beverly 
Hills-based thrift until Dec. 31. In those earlier charges, the OTS said 
Spiegel squandered $19 million of the thrift's money on such items as corporate 
jets, condominiums, submachine guns and loans to friends. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS had been seeking to force Spiegel to pay Columbia $19 million in 
restitution and fine him an additional $5 million. What is unclear is whether 
the OTS is seeking the entire $29.2-million loss on the building as additional 
restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Perluss, a lawyer for Spiegel, said the new allegations are vague on 
that point. Tom Mason, an OTS spokesman, said that the agency is "seeking a 
substantial amount of the $29.2-million loss. The numbers will firm up as we go 
along." 
</P>
<P>
Perluss refused to comment on the OTS allegations. He said he and Spiegel's 
other attorneys plan to prove that the charges are without merit. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia is now insolvent, largely because of losses in its portfolio of risky 
junk bonds. It has agreed to sell the bonds for $3 billion to a Canadian-led 
partnership, although the sale must be approved by regulators and could be 
scrapped by the prospective buyer should fighting break out in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Details about the bomb shelters and other extravagances at the still-unoccupied 
Wilshire Boulevard headquarters building were first reported by the Los Angeles 
Times in July. The building was originally projected to cost $17 million, less 
than one-third what it actually cost, and has a market value of $24 million, 
according to the OTS. Columbia has put the 80,000-square-foot building up for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
In its allegations, the OTS blames Spiegel for the losses by personally 
ordering design changes, among them the "survival chamber" bathrooms with 
bulletproof glass. Sources have said that Spiegel wanted them in the building 
as protection against possible terrorist attacks. The headquarters also was to 
feature compartments storing independent air and food supplies, stainless steel 
floors and leather wall coverings. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS alleges that Spiegel never received approval from directors for the 
building and never informed them of the cost overruns. Columbia's new 
management scrapped most of those features before they were completed to make 
the building more marketable, even though materials to build them were already 
bought. But some features, such as the building's limestone exterior, could not 
be eliminated because it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
The new allegations did not include some other areas of Spiegel's spending that 
investigators have reviewed, such as his extensive personal security detail and 
the use by Spiegel and his family of Columbia's Hyatt Newporter resort in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, OTS Director Timothy Ryan decided that 
administrative proceedings against Spiegel and former Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan operator Charles H. Keating Jr. would be made public. Both men are 
expected to face hearings before administrative law judges later this year. The 
regulatory agency is seeking $40.9 million in restitution from Keating, former 
chairman of the Irvine-based thrift's parent, American Continental Corp., and 
five other American Continental officers.

ARCO DELIVERS ITS 2ND PUNCH IN CLEANER-BURNING GAS WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield Co. unveiled its second reduced-emissions gasoline Thursday 
-- this one for cars using premium unleaded fuel -- and called it the 
"cleanest-burning" automobile fuel available in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The new Arco product, a high-octane unleaded gasoline called EC-Premium, was 
introduced at more than 700 service stations between Santa Barbara and San 
Diego and was touted by Arco executives at a Los Angeles news conference and 
later in interviews. 
</P>
<P>
The company was the first oil firm to put a reduced-emissions gasoline on the 
market, introducing its EC-1 -- a replacement for regular leaded gasoline -- a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
By introducing another low-emission gasoline -- in this case, a reformulated 
product that is replacing Arco's 91-octane super unleaded in the Southland -- 
the company hopes to impress Congress and the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District, an agency that monitors and regulates air quality in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress and the local district have been developing clean-air 
proposals that are likely to mandate tougher gasoline emission standards and 
require more use of alternative fuels such as methanol. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to get out front because we wanted to convince regulators and 
legislators that reformulated gasoline was an alternative to regular gasoline 
and the most efficient way to clean up the air," Arco Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook 
said during an interview Thursday. "We thought it (EC-Premium) would be another 
way to reduce pollution, and we decided to go ahead and do it." 
</P>
<P>
Arco said tests of the new gasoline show significant reductions in hazardous 
emissions. Arco has about 15% of the premium gasoline market in Southern 
California, and the company said that if its current premium customers buy the 
same quantities of EC-Premium, auto emissions in the South Coast Air Basin 
would be reduced by 43 tons a day. Currently, vehicle emissions in the basin 
total about 6,077 tons daily. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based oil firm said the new gasoline emits less carbon monoxide 
and less benzene, a carcinogenic chemical. EC-Premium also has reduced levels 
of aromatics and olefins, a group of chemical components that contribute to the 
formation of smog, company executives said. 
</P>
<P>
Arco is one of a number of oil companies that have introduced cleaner-burning 
unleaded gasoline in the past 12 months. Since Arco introduced EC-1 last 
September, a number of cleaner-burning unleaded versions have been placed on 
the market. Among them are Shell's SU 2000E, Chevron's Supreme Unleaded and 
Exxon's Reduced Emissions Exxon Supreme and Exxon Plus. 
</P>
<P>
To compete, Cook said, Arco will sell its new premium at the same price as its 
old high-octane product despite the fact that the new EC-Premium costs 4 cents 
more per gallon to produce. He said the company hopes to make up the difference 
by increasing its sales volume and market share in Southern California.

WESTERN BANKS OUTPERFORM OTHERS IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's banking system slid further downhill during the second quarter, 
but Western states, bucking the broader trend, enjoyed relatively stable 
profits and a declining number of delinquent real estate loans, federal 
officials reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks nationwide suffered a steep 24% profit decline during April, 
May and June as they set aside large sums to cover expected losses on real 
estate and loans to developing countries, according to a new study by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The deepening recession in New England, accompanied by growing delinquencies in 
real estate lending in the region, was responsible for much of the $2 billion 
put in reserve for future losses for banks nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, "California continues to show good results -- at this time, 
the West is clearly looking strong," FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Western region, dominated by California, reported increased profits for the 
quarter. California banks substantially increased real estate lending, but it 
was primarily residential mortgages, the "safest kind of lending," Seidman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide results are "clearly a mixed bag," he said. The kind of real 
estate woes afflicting New England are now being duplicated in less severe 
fashion in the middle Atlantic states and the Southeast, according to the FDIC. 
The number of delinquent loans -- those overdue 90 days or more -- is growing 
steadily throughout the East, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's 12,500 commercial banks recorded profits of $5.3 billion during 
the second quarter, down from $7 billion earned in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Profits plunged 63% in the Northeast region. "The credit quality problems of 
banks in the Northeast were not limited to real estate assets," the FDIC said 
in a quarterly bank profile issued Thursday. "Commercial credits, loans to 
developing countries and consumer loans all showed weakness, reflecting the 
increasing difficulties facing many large regional and money-center 
institutions." 
</P>
<P>
The real estate slump in New England has spread to Eastern and Southeastern 
states, dragging down bank earnings. Profits also fell in the central region of 
the country, the agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, profits rose 4% in the West, climbing to $1.27 billion from $1.22 
billion a year earlier. The region includes California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, 
Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
California generated most of the earnings, with second-quarter profits of $906 
million, down 7% from $977 million in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, the banking system has continued to shift significantly 
into real estate lending, the FDIC said. "This is not an adverse factor if done 
on a sound basis," Seidman said. "Clearly banks are picking up some of the 
business S&amp;Ls used to do." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, banks increased their real estate lending by 11%, while in California 
the increase was a hefty 30%. Home mortgages increased more than $5 billion, an 
11% rise, while home equity loans rose $1.1 billion, or 13%, in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"California indicators are showing very favorably," said Ross Waldrop, 
financial analyst in the FDIC's research division. "The growth in assets is 
well above the national average. Banks are making more loans, and we have yet 
to see signs of problems surfacing." 
</P>
<P>
Only 1.44% of real estate loans in California were listed as noncurrent on 
payments, compared to a national figure of 3.45%. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the delinquent share of real estate loans held by California 
banks fell by about 1%, while the bad portfolio nationally rose 14.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, federal officials see potential weaknesses for California in the 
high vacancy rates reported in some areas for office and commercial buildings. 
"We are watching it carefully," Seidman said. "The ability to absorb (the empty 
floor space) depends on the strength of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
California's bullish statistics were tempered by a warning that the state may 
not be immune from the problems affecting other regions. 
</P>
<P>
"Experience in the Southwest and New England shows that problems can continue 
to appear long after the growth stops," the FDIC report said. "Consequently, we 
are not abandoning our concerns about the impact of slower markets on the 
health of the Western banks." 
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf crisis should help the oil-producing states in the Southwest, 
where increased revenues from higher petroleum prices will boost local 
economies, generating new bank loans and helping depressed real estate prices, 
according to FDIC officials. 
</P>
<P>
New England, already staggering under the biggest concentrations of problem 
loans, will be hurt even more by higher costs for heating oil and other fuels 
during the coming winter season, the report warned.

IRS Cancels Sale of Paulsen's Winery: The Internal Revenue Service said it 
canceled the public sale of comedian Pat Paulsen's troubled winery operation 
and property in northern Sonoma County because of legal challenges made by 
Paulsen's bankruptcy attorney, David Replogle. The forced sale of Paulsen's 
home, winery and the village of Asti, which he owns, had been set for Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS seized the property and put it up for sale to recover $277,000 in 
unpaid taxes owed by Paulsen and his first wife, Jane Paulsen. Replogle said 
the Paulsens' property is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which provides protection 
from creditors while debtors get finances in order. The Paulsens' total debt is 
$2 million. "The IRS is not above the law, they have to follow the same rules 
as everyone else," Replogle said.

Merger activity Dips: The number of mergers and acquisitions dropped 10% in 
August from July, while the dollar value of the deals fell 63%, IDD Information 
Services said. The research firm said 295 deals valued at $10.1 billion were 
announced in August, compared to 328 deals valued at $26.9 billion in July. IDD 
attributed the drop to the increasing unpopularity of junk bond deals, making 
funding herder to come by.

RTC Wins Stay in Return of S&amp;L: A federal appeals panel ordered the 
Resolution Trust Corp. to retake control of Franklin Savings Assn. 
</P>
<P>
-- just hours after the thrift's managers had moved back into their offices. 
Operators of the largest thrift in Kansas were allowed back in the offices in 
the morning, after U.S. District Judge Dale E. Saffels ruled Wednesday that 
regulators had improperly seized the S&amp;L. But the government obtained a 
stay Thursday afternoon from the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. 
Franklin officials could not be reached for comment.

Argentine Judge Suspends Sale of Airline: Administrative Law Judge Oscar Garzon 
Funes suspended the sale of the state-owned airline Aerolineas Argentinas to 
Iberia of Spain because the proposed buyers made the down payment by letter of 
credit instead of cash. Funes gave the Public Works Ministry eight days to 
explain why it accepted the letter of credit, after which he said he would 
decide whether to annul the sale. A consortium led by Spain's state airline 
Iberia agreed in July to buy 85% of Aerolineas for $260 million and the 
retirement of $2 billion of Argentina's foreign debt.

IBM in Venture to Create New Software: International Business Machines said it 
formed a partnership with Metaphor Computer Systems of Mountain View to create 
new software that will allow individual programs to work with multiple computer 
operating systems and networks. Software publishers now must write different 
versions of the same program for each different operating system. The pact 
could strain IBM's relationship with Microsoft Corp., which has created most of 
the operating system software used on IBM personal computers.

Fed Voids Bank-Insurance Law: The Federal Reserve Board voided a Delaware law 
allowing banks to sell insurance nationwide in what banking officials described 
as a turf battle between the central bank and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. The order targeted Family Guardian Life Insurance Co., a company 
controlled by Citicorp's wholly-owned Citibank of Delaware, and ordered the 
operation closed. The reserve board said safeguards placed in the law by the 
FDIC were so restrictive they, in effect, barred banks from the insurance 
business, and by federal law a subsidiary or division also cannot engage in 
that business.

RISING OIL PRICES CAUSE 31.93 DROP IN THE DOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stocks fell broadly Thursday as renewed concern over the Persian Gulf crisis 
sent crude oil prices surging back above the $30-a-barrel mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index fell 31.93 points, or 1.2%, to 2,596.29. New 
York Stock Exchange volume remained light at 125.6 million shares, compared to 
120.6 million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 9 to 
5 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 511 up, 960 down and 490 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Worry over the Mideast was rekindled by word that an Iraqi soldier shot and 
wounded an American in Kuwait. The news sent crude oil for October delivery up 
$1.66, or 5.6%, to $31.43 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was 
the highest close since Aug. 23 -- the same day the Dow reached its August low 
of 2,483. 
</P>
<P>
An ebb in the oil price rally last week helped stocks recoup some ground. But 
crude oil has made a strong turn upward this week. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, fresh signs of economic weakness have begun to overshadow 
hopes for a Federal Reserve move to lower interest rates. Major retailers 
Thursday reported that sales were sluggish last month, adding to worries about 
a potential recession. 
</P>
<P>
"Retailers are coming into the most important part of the year -- Christmas -- 
and with consumer confidence at a low point and the possibility of recession 
lingering, consumers may be very tight with their pocketbooks," said Jack 
Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, investors are nervous ahead of today's report on employment, which 
could show enough weakness in the economy to spur the Fed to act. 
</P>
<P>
Even if interest rates fall, the prospect of deteriorating corporate profits is 
proving worrisome for the market. 
</P>
<P>
Among market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Motorola plunged 7 7/8 to 61 1/2, as analysts lowered earnings estimates. 
Other tech stocks also fell, including Texas Instruments, off 1 1/8 to 26 1/4, 
Honeywell, off 3 1/2 to 94 3/8, and Intel, off 1 1/4 to 31 1/4. The group has 
been hit hard of late on economic worries. 
</P>
<P>
* The over-the-counter market suffered less than the Dow. The NASDAQ OTC 
composite index fell 3.66 to 378.78, a 1% drop, compared to the Dow's 1.2%. 
</P>
<P>
* Industrial stocks were big losers on renewed recession fears. GM dropped 7/8 
to 37 3/8, Du Pont fell 1 to 35 1/2, Deere lost 1 3/4 to 56 and Ingersoll Rand 
dipped 1 1/8 to 43 1/8. Prudential-Bache cut auto-maker earnings estimates, 
citing the Mideast crisis. 
</P>
<P>
* Worries about retail sales in light of a weak August performance hurt many 
retailers. Limited lost 1 1/8 to 15 5/8, Wal-Mart fell 1 to 27 3/8, Toys R Us 
slipped 3/4 to 23 3/4 and May Department Stores lost 1/2 to 45 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Oil stocks rallied early, then faded. Mobil added 1/2 to 66 1/4, and Oryx 
gained 1 1/4 to 53 1/2, but Arco closed flat at 138 3/4 after trading as high 
as 141 1/4, and Unocal slipped 1/4 to 33 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Shares on the London Stock Exchange finished sharply lower amid Mideast 
concerns and Wall Street weakness, dealers said. The Financial Times 100-share 
index closed off 31.3 at 2,120.9, the day's low. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices closed mixed in Frankfurt, West Germany, in thin trading. The DAX 
index of 30 leading blue chips ended 7.15 points lower at 1,557.12. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bonds End Mixed on Jobs Optimism 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/32 point, or about $1.56 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which declines as the bond's price rises, edged 
down to 8.95% from late Wednesday's 8.96%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was 8.125%, down from 10% late Wednesday, when the rate surged on 
technical factors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Off as Fed's Intentions Debated 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished mostly lower in thin trading on the world's currency 
markets as speculation mounted over whether the Federal Reserve is poised to 
nudge interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
It took its biggest hit against the Japanese yen, falling to an 11-month low, 
and gave up significant ground against the British pound. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar bought 1.554 German marks late Thursday in New York, down from 1.558 
late Wednesday. It fell to 140.70 yen from 141.85. 
</P>
<P>
The pound, meanwhile, was bolstered by anticipation that Britain will join the 
European exchange rate mechanism during a meeting of European finance ministers 
in Rome this weekend. The mechanism establishes currency rates for a basket of 
European Community countries. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9075 from $1.8990 late Wednesday. In 
New York, it cost $1.9125 to buy 1 pound, more expensive than Wednesday's 
$1.9055.

Gold Up on Anxiety About the Economy 
</P>
<P>
Gold neared $390 an ounce, the third straight day of rising prices, as the 
market continued its recovery from last week's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike last month's explosive rally, analysts said, gold's strength 
appeared to reflect investor concerns about the economy rather than knee-jerk 
reactions to Persian Gulf developments. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $3.20 to $3.60 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, 
with the contract for spot delivery up $3.60 at $389.70 an ounce. The heavily 
traded December contract settled at $396.20. 
</P>
<P>
Silver for September reached $4.77 an ounce, up 4 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Spot gold has climbed $7.40 an ounce this week after plunging $32.70 last week 
amid perceptions that the U.S.-Iraq confrontation was cooling down.

SATIRICAL TWIST ON LOSS-OF-INNOCENCE TALE;

<P>
Opening with the jaded voice of an aging English writer revisiting his favorite 
rooms in the Tate Gallery, "A Bottle in the Smoke" immediately whisks us back 
to the 1950s, when narrator Julian Ramsay has just arrived in London. 
</P>
<P>
Eager, callow and confident of an eventual welcome in the literary 
Establishment, he impulsively left the security of a job at a shirt company for 
the precarious existence of an unpublished novelist. 
</P>
<P>
A friend already at work in publishing steers him to lodgings with an odd 
couple of semi-employed actors -- Fenella and Rikko, who not only provide him 
with a convenient address but also with material for the most diverting 
passages in this purported memoir. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the additional color and incidents come from Ramsay's part-time stint 
as barman in a run-down pub managed by a foul-mouthed tough who bears an eerie 
resemblance to T.S. Eliot. 
</P>
<P>
Although the title suggests the pub's atmosphere and its stock-in-trade, "A 
Bottle in the Smoke" is actually a Biblical reference. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't have been a glass bottle," explains Julian's Uncle Roy, a vicar 
emeritus. "You've got to think of yourself shriveling up like an old leather 
pouch too near the fire." Something of the sort may eventually happen to the 
narrator in the third and last volume of this trilogy, but here, in the second 
book, Julian is blooming in the heady air of his chosen world. 
</P>
<P>
Orphaned in early childhood, Julian was brought up in the country vicarage by 
Uncle Roy, regaled all his life by tales of the illustrious Lampitt family, 
relations of the vicar. Now in London, Julian is introduced to Anne, who turns 
out to be the niece of one of these same Lampitts, a coincidence that so 
delights Julian's guardian that Uncle Roy forgives his nephew his defection to 
London. 
</P>
<P>
After Julian and Anne marry, the tone of the novel deepens. The romantic dream 
of young love and la vie boheme is complicated and soured by the machinations 
of Raphael Hunter, an ambitious and unscrupulous young journalist who is 
writing a biography of Anne's eccentric uncle, Sargie Lampitt. His book will 
expose family secrets never openly acknowledged by the fond vicar or by other 
accomplished and prominent members of the Lampitt clan. 
</P>
<P>
Trusting and naive, Julian is only too glad to allow Hunter to act as his 
literary agent and mentor. When his first novel is accepted for publication, 
Julian never tumbles to the fact that Hunter's favors must be paid for in kind. 
Hunter is not interested in Julian's artistic future, but in gaining access to 
another of Lampitt's private diaries, journals that will thoroughly demolish 
the cherished Lampitt legend and tarnish several current reputations. 
</P>
<P>
What might otherwise be a routine loss-of-innocence story is transformed by 
these convolutions into a satiric and often comic exploration of the underside 
of London's literary world. Even as they lie, betray and exploit one another 
for personal advantage, A.N. Wilson's characters remain poised and witty, 
wonderful company even -- and especially -- at their worst. 
</P>
<P>
They're so amusingly wicked that we're almost sorry when Julian has an 
illuminating experience while walking through Bloomsbury Square. There, in an 
apercu that hints at a new direction for Volume III, he realizes: "I did not 
really want to be an actor; I did not want to be married; I no longer cared 
about this book, though I felt the beginnings of a deeper desire to write fully 
and honestly, not with the brittle surface of my mind, and not humorously or 
cruelly." 
</P>
<P>
Happily, this wholesome and admirable vow is already receding as he emerges 
from the square on his way to a party, wondering "which, or how many Sitwells 
would be standing at the top of the stairs when I went in" -- a hint that the 
clever, detached narrator will still be around for the next book, at least at 
the beginning.

HOT TO SHOP: THROWN FOR A LOOP BY RODEO DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER and JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HOT: I have some relatives coming to town who saw the film "Pretty Woman" 
and loved it. I thought it would be fun to take them to some of the shops Julia 
Roberts went to in Beverly Hills. Could you list them? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A.M., West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR A.M.: That movie was the ultimate shopper's dream, wasn't it? What we'd 
give to be able to spend limitlessly on Rodeo Drive -- and have a pizza thrown 
in as well. Fortunately, you don't need a Swiss bank account to check out some 
of the stores that either provided merchandise or were featured in the movie, 
namely: 
</P>
<P>
* Boulmiche (9501 Santa Monica Blvd.) offers ready-to-wear designs from young 
European designers. 
</P>
<P>
* Valentino (414 N. Rodeo Drive) is where Roberts picked up many of her 
exquisite suits, that red gown and the dress she wore in the polo match scene. 
</P>
<P>
* Fred Joaillier (401 N. Rodeo Drive) features pricey gemstone baubles and 
watches. 
</P>
<P>
* Gucci (347 N. Rodeo Drive) hardly needs explaining for those familiar with 
the leather handbags, luggage, shoes and accessories that made logo-flaunting a 
national past-time. 
</P>
<P>
* Mr. Guy (previously on Rodeo, now at 301 N. Canon Drive) wasn't filmed for 
the movie, but the store did provide Richard Gere's finely tailored Cerruti 
1881 suits. 
</P>
<P>
* The Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel (9500 Wilshire Blvd.) is where the couple 
lived out their Cinderella fantasy. If you can't afford the Presidential Suite 
at $3,000 a day, it's a nice place to have afternoon tea and watch the world go 
by. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Entertainment Weekly magazine totaled up what Roberts' wardrobe 
would have cost had Gere actually purchased it for her: a stunning $26,804.48, 
including some outfits custom-made by the film's wardrobe designer, Marilyn 
Vance-Straker. When life imitates art, it can get pretty expensive. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT: I'm one of those "big, beautiful women." My problem is, despite all 
the new stores specializing in clothing for people my size, I haven't found any 
that carry really sexy lingerie. There's plenty of basic, utilitarian underwear 
and a some very elegant robes and teddies out there for women in larger sizes, 
but they're still too prim for me. I want something that sizzles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- G.K., Pacific Palisades 
</P>
<P>
DEAR G.K.: There's a new catalogue for the Delta Burke set that should suit 
your needs just swell. It's called Oh! Such Style and features bustiers, bikini 
underwear, garter belts, laced-topped thigh-high stockings and one item that 
shall go unmentioned here. Trust us: It's in the truly trashy tradition. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the catalogue has more conservative styles, such as terry-cloth 
robes, peignoirs, teddies, caftans and slips. Styles are designed for 
full-figured women equivalent to dress sizes 16 through 28. Prices range from 
$5 for a pair of nylon stretch stockings to $126 for a three-piece satin pajama 
set. For a free copy of Oh! Such Style, call (800) 835-2246 ext. 272.

THEATER: AMANDA MCBROOM SHOULD FACE THE MUSIC AND CLEAR HER STORY LINE OF 
CLICHE-RIDDEN STEREOTYPES.

<P>
Among Amanda McBroom's greatest charms is her ability to appear guileless as a 
performer. Certainly, the actress-singer-songwriter lays it right on the line 
in her opening monologue in "Heartbeats," which opened Wednesday at the Old 
Globe Theatre's Cassius Carter Centre Stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always loved love songs," she says. "It's people that make love so much 
more complicated than it needs to be." 
</P>
<P>
Yet "Heartbeats" is a strange beast. Not quite a musical or a revue, it is a 
thin story that strings together a collection of McBroom's love songs -- some 
funny, some tender, some touching and, the one that made her famous, "The 
Rose," an absolute blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, when McBroom tries to write people into the script that now 
accompanies the revue she premiered in Los Angeles four years ago, the 
complications of human life overwhelm her. 
</P>
<P>
She reduces the very real struggles that couples face in trying to keep their 
love alive to an assembly line of cliches: 
</P>
<P>
A husband watches too much football. His wife -- a housewife -- can't get his 
attention. After 20 years, is the magic over? Will he bring her flowers for her 
40th birthday? Will he remember to tell her he loves her? 
</P>
<P>
No kidding -- that's the script for which director Bill Castellino shares the 
credit, or rather the blame. 
</P>
<P>
Even sitcom writers don't write sitcoms like that anymore -- and for good 
reason. This text belongs in a home for the criminally inane. 
</P>
<P>
The performers are not to be faulted; all six, including McBroom, are terrific 
both as singers and actors, and they bring out the best from the songs. 
</P>
<P>
McBroom and her real-life husband, George Ball, play the husband and wife at 
the heart of the play. McBroom is haunting, especially when she delivers 
"Dreaming" -- her portrait of a woman who lives in dreams because dreams "are 
the only thing that's mine." 
</P>
<P>
But can anyone really believe that a woman with as commanding a stage presence 
as McBroom is a passive victim with no goal or purpose in life other than to 
get her husband to turn off the television? 
</P>
<P>
You only need to listen to the songs to know that this smart lady knows the 
score; that her fatal flaw lies not in controlling too little, but in trying to 
control too much -- including this show. If she would face the music and take 
stock of real people rather than stereotypes, she might have the beginnings of 
a real musical. 
</P>
<P>
Ball, who will be replaced Sept. 25 by Richard Hilton, offers solid support, as 
does the four-person ensemble that alternates between playing a stylized Greek 
chorus and a variety of individual parts. Hilary James, a delicate, 
sweet-voiced treasure, plays the wife's memory of herself as a young girl. 
Impeccable singing is provided by Lee Lucas, who plays the husband's memory of 
himself as a young man, as well as Mary Bond Davis as McBroom's sassy, 
big-voiced friend, and Daniel McDonald as the son and later a male exotic 
dancer who tempts McBroom to come home with him for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Dorsey's set is imaginative and funny -- with a bench and a wheel on a 
revolving stage, he suggests a car weaving on the road. Dorsey's lighting is 
fine and Christina Haatainen's costumes colorful and clever. 
</P>
<P>
The musical direction and vocal arrangements by Jerry Sternbach (who wrote some 
of the music along with Michele Brourman, Tom Snow and McBroom) are powerful. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the music, in fact, crushes the fragile story line that McBroom 
and Castellino have hatched between them. 
</P>

LATC Grant: Los Angeles' Community Redevelopment Agency voted Thursday to give 
a $478,000 subsidy to the Los Angeles Theatre Center, slightly less than half 
the proposed figure. 
</P>
<P>
The allotment was based on the amount estimated necessary to complete the 
1990-91 fall/winter LATC season. CRA Chairman Jim Wood said, "The board 
accepted its obligation to the season ticket holders for the scheduled 
performances." The figures proposed to cover property taxes and interest 
payments were not granted by the CRA. The future of the LATC is still 
uncertain, pending a report from Mayor Bradley's LATC Study Group. BETH KLEID

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: MAINSTREAM SEEMS TO SUIT 
STILL-THRIVING TEATRO META

<P>
Raul Moncada, director of the Old Globe Theatre's Teatro Meta program, crossed 
his fingers when he was told last year that the Globe would be absorbing Teatro 
Meta as a department rather than continuing with it as a separately funded 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
The fear expressed by some observers was that mainstreaming might water down 
the project and ultimately eliminate it. 
</P>
<P>
Moncada was never one of the public naysayers, but he does acknowledge now that 
he was more than a little worried at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"There was that time of hesitation when we didn't know how the incorporation 
would work out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the inclusion of "La Fiaca" -- a 1987 Teatro Meta workshop 
presentation -- on the 1991 winter schedule, as well as a new play by Argentine 
playwright Lillian Garrett ("The White Rose"), Moncada said he feels that 
mainstreaming is working. 
</P>
<P>
His confidence in his project's future is further bolstered by a $45,000 
playwrighting grant that came in just last week from the Ford Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The money is designated to commission four first drafts from North American 
Latino playwrights. The Old Globe might produce those scripts, but has no 
obligation to do so, Moncada said. 
</P>
<P>
Moncada, who translated "La Fiaca" by Argentine writer Ricardo Talesnik, as 
well as the Globe's 1990 presentation of "The Granny" (another Teatro Meta 
discovery) by Argentine writer Roberto Cossa, will also continue to seek out 
new work by Latin American authors. 
</P>
<P>
Moncada has traveled to Argentina, Venezuela and Uruguay in search of scripts, 
and is headed next to Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica on Oct. 11-31. The 
trip is being sponsored by Partners of the Americas, a national organization 
based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Repertory Theatre is continuing its commitment to Latino theater 
with its annual Teatro Sin Fronteras project. The San Diego premiere of "Man of 
the Flesh," by Texas playwright Octavio Solis, will play Jan. 5 to Feb. 2 in 
the Lyceum Space. 
</P>
<P>
"Man of the Flesh" replaces Ariel Dorfman's "Widows." The 20th-Century 
reworking of the Don Juan story will be co-directed by San Diego Rep Producing 
Director Sam Woodhouse and UC San Diego Professor Jorge Huerta, for both 
English and Spanish performances. 
</P>
<P>
In the play, Juan is a womanizing young man from the barrio who gets a 
comeuppance from his mother on "El Dia de los Muertos," the Mexican "Day of the 
Dead" when spirits travel between this world and the next. 
</P>
<P>
In the English version, the all-Latino cast will be double-cast as 
working-class Latino actors and upper-class Anglos from La Jolla; in the 
Spanish version the cast will double as working-class Latinos and upper-class 
Mexicans from La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
The play was commissioned by the city of Dallas in 1988, originally was 
performed by Teatro Dallas, and received its professional world premiere at the 
South Coast Repertory in Orange County last May. 
</P>
<P>
Solis is working on a Spanish translation that will premiere at the Rep. 
</P>
<P>
When "Loot" closes Saturday at the San Diego Rep, actress Suzanne Schefke will 
be bidding a fond farewell to her coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Schefke made her professional debut as the corpse of Mrs. McLeavy in Joe 
Orton's black comedy, and for her, it has been anything but a "deadening" 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
It may seem an odd choice for a nurse who left that profession for acting 
because she wanted to get out of what she calls "the illness" of nursing. 
</P>
<P>
But "it's been a wonderful experience," said Schefke. "I lay still for long 
periods doing shallow breathing. And it's carried over into my personal life. 
Over the last few weeks, I found myself much more able to concentrate on 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Schefke gets into her coffin before the audience is allowed into the Lyceum 
Stage area. She has to remain there for thirty minutes until the play starts 
and then at least another 20 to 25 minutes before Jon Matthews, who plays her 
son, Hal, gets the idea to hide stolen money in her coffin and hide her dead 
body in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, she has to be emptied upside down into the wardrobe. Which was 
why the first question at her audition was whether she could stand on her head. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I said yes, because I really wanted to do this," Schefke said. "But 
I didn't know if I could." 
</P>
<P>
She does it, though, for just about a minute and a half until the wardrobe is 
closed and she can sneak out through a trap door in the wall behind. 
</P>
<P>
The experience has given her a new perspective on her chosen profession. 
</P>
<P>
She saw a clip from Franco Zeffirelli's "Romeo and Juliet" Monday and the part 
that impressed her the most was -- you guessed it -- the scene in the crypt. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was just amazing that Olivia Hussey (who played Juliet) stood 
still for that long. I was really impressed that I couldn't see her breathing."

'PACIFIC CONNECTIONS': CONTRASTING WORKS BY ISLAND GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recognizing the sea as a life force for so many world cultures, the Los Angeles 
Festival brought to the Sunset Canyon Recreation Center on Wednesday three 
island groups with very obvious differences: the tiny Inupiat Eskimos of 
Alaska's King Island (in the Bering Sea), the lanky Mornington Island 
Aboriginals from Australia's Gulf of Carpentaria and the massive Polynesians 
from the islands of Wallis and Futuna in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, "Pacific Connections" made group body type a revealing issue. 
Indeed the dancers' distinctive use of this most basic natural resource became 
one of the major themes of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Half-squatting, with legs wide apart, the Polynesians often used their weight 
as a kind of power center to give the smallest motions enormous force. 
</P>
<P>
The Aboriginals, however, denied weight in mostly linear statements, sometimes 
wielding sticks and spears as extensions of their shanklike limbs. Finally, the 
Eskimos enlarged their dancing by manipulation of scale, drawing you 
perceptually into an intimate frame-of-reference through movement close to the 
body and a tightly focused use of stage space. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by voice, boomerang-percussion and didjeridoo, the Woomera 
Mornington Island Culture Team included children as well as adults -- all 
wearing face and body paint, with bunches of greenery tied to the men's knees 
and ropelike strands providing both over-skirts for the women and a kind of 
tassel hanging from the men's waists. 
</P>
<P>
Trembling legs, racheting feet and rapid (almost flicked-out) gestural metaphor 
for the hands and arms gave their brief nature-dances tremendous nervous 
energy. Samuel Pilot described their meaning lovingly and helped us see them in 
context. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in long grass skirts and collars, with fuschia overlays around necks 
and hips, the Wallis and Futuna dancers brought a disarming sweetness to 
traditional dances of group solidarity accompanied by voice, percussion and 
guitar. The muscular investment of the men's dancing seemed especially 
remarkable, since their power carried absolutely no hint of threat. 
</P>
<P>
Surprising frissons: When a man banged his fingers in the pole dance, he didn't 
hide his pain -- any more than a woman concealed her wry self-disgust when she 
reached a kneeling position later than anyone else. Avoiding the mask of 
professionalism to maintain personal contact with one another and the audience, 
these dancers stayed gloriously themselves throughout a long, demanding 
performance. We couldn't get enough of them. 
</P>
<P>
Again introduced by Lillian Tiulana, the King Island Inupiat presented the same 
works reviewed on the "'Native Dance of North America" program Tuesday.

TRI-CULTURAL FESTIVAL IN BALBOA PARK; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: SUNDAY'S PERFORMANCES WILL FOCUS ON THREE COUNTRIES -- MEXICO, SPAIN AND 
THE PHILIPPINES.

<P>
Cultural expressions from Mexico, Spain and the Philippines will be vividly 
displayed Sunday under the umbrella of the Tri-Cultural Music and Dance 
Festival at the Centro Cultural de la Raza in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
A four-hour marathon of music and dance will feature ethnic foods along with 
nonstop live entertainment -- all designed to highlight historical ties among 
the three ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
During its 20-year history, the cultural center has focused on Chicano culture, 
especially the arts of Mexico. But Sunday's concert, scheduled to run from 2 to 
6 p.m. at the center's Balboa Park facility, will be its first foray into the 
art forms of the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is to preserve Mexican culture, but we like to think up ways to 
collaborate with other colorful cultures," said Eloise De Leon, Performing Arts 
Coordinator for the center. 
</P>
<P>
Lolita Carter, founder of the Samahan Philippine Dance Company, conceived and 
coordinated the event to celebrate what she called "a common heritage." 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the Philippines and Mexico were both part of Spain at the same 
time," Carter said. "Both were colonized in 1521. Of course, there are 
differences, but the Filipinos are very Spanish in their music and dances, and 
their food and customs are very similar. I wanted to explore our common 
heritage in this festival. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Carlos Santoyo (director of the Mexican Folklorico troupe) and Carla 
Herredia (leader of the Spanish-flavored flamenco ensemble) to participate, 
because you have to bring in Mexican and flamenco dance when you (focus) on the 
common links between Mexican and Philippine dance," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexicans borrowed a lot from us, and vice versa," Carter said. "That was 
inevitable since the Philippines were governed from Mexico, and there was a lot 
of trade exchange between Acapulco and Manila. When you see the dances side by 
side, you will notice these shared roots." 
</P>
<P>
Carter organized the festival to showcase that common artistic ancestry, but 
she also wanted to provide a broader cultural context for the ethnic dance and 
music. She invited Rizalino Oades, a history professor at San Diego State 
University, to introduce the event with a historical overview of the 
colonization of Mexico and the Philippines. In addition, the artistic directors 
of each group will talk about their art before the performances. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be speaking about the connection between the Philippines and Mexico -- 
links that go back almost three centuries," Oades said. "Since the Philippines 
were governed by Spain through Mexico, there was not just an exchange of goods 
between the two peoples, there was also a lot of intermarriage between them. In 
fact, some Philippine towns were even named after Mexican places. And 
Philippine seamen were probably the first Asian settlers of North America." 
</P>
<P>
The Philippine dancers assimilated the graceful curve of their port de bras 
from the Spanish conquerors, for example, while the Spanish influence in 
Mexican dance is more pronounced in the fancy footwork, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of similarity in the arms between Spanish and Philippine dance 
forms," Carter said. "The Mexicans aren't concerned about the arms very much, 
but they use a lot more of the foot tapping than we do. Even in Philippine 
dance, however, there is a little tapping" based on the lightning-fast heel 
claps that characterize flamenco dance. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine dance is actually a melting pot of styles that draw on kinetic 
expressions from Indonesia, Bali and Malaysia. But for this tri-cultural 
celebration, Carter's 10-member company will concentrate on dances rooted in 
Spanish culture. 
</P>
<P>
The Samahan troupe will bring its own live musical accompaniment -- the 
Philippine Rondalla, a small string orchestra -- and a singer. Unfortunately, 
due to funding shortfalls, the Mexican dances will be accompanied by recorded 
mariachi music. 
</P>
<P>
Santoyo's folklorico group was formed at Chula Vista's Castle Park High School 
in 1975, and they perform a range of Latino dances around town. For Sunday, 
Santoyo chose a suite of six strongly Spanish dances from the region of 
Jalisco. 
</P>
<P>
"We wear charro costumes, derivatives of what the Spaniards wore. The 
indigenous people were not allowed to ride horses, so wearing charro suits was 
considered a status symbol." 
</P>
<P>
The dances reflect Spanish courting customs, as well, Santoyo explained. 
</P>
<P>
Dancers "don't hold each other, because the etiquette does not allow it. They 
only hold each other by the eyes," he said. "One of the main differences is the 
posture and the way feelings are expressed. The Spaniards were upright and 
rigid. The Mexicans show more enjoyment in their dancing. The Mexicans even 
transformed the instruments and rhythmic structure" of Spanish music. 
</P>
<P>
Although the festival participants have prepared an assortment of ethnic 
dances, they are all convinced that the value of the daylong event will 
transcend mere entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"If this festival is successful, we're hoping to do another one next year," 
Carter said. "The Philippines and Mexicans are the two biggest minority groups 
in San Diego. There are about 150,000 Filipinos in the county. Only the 
Mexicans are larger."

'ICICLE THIEF' AN INGENIOUS PARODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bless the Italians and their obsession with movies. Having created a permanent 
niche in the hearts of the world's movie sentimentalists with "Cinema 
Paradiso," they now let loose their secret weapon, writer-director-actor and 
comic extraordinaire, Maurizio Nichetti. 
</P>
<P>
In his ingenious comedy "The Icicle Thief" (Royal, Esquire) Nichetti has taken 
a wide-eyed look at his own cinema, past and present, and has staggered back 
from the vision, his mind brimming over with invention. On the one hand, there 
is Italy's hallowed neo-realist past, those grainy, black-and-white postwar 
images full of stubbled, unemployed fathers, sacrificial mothers and brave, 
bustling priests. On the other, there are the television shows that "present" 
these films: a wasteland of lofty, sluglike critics, only too willing to 
interpret a director's deepest motives and intentions -- even to the director 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is a third factor: Italian television itself, a dizzying fantasy 
world of perky jingles and pop color schemes, in which elongated blondes dive 
into an astonished consumer's wineglass or bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
Nichetti has narrowed those soulful eyes of his, taken dead aim and come up 
with a sweetly hilarious movie that somehow braids all three. It's 
three-dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe with deuces wild, to mix metaphors as cheerfully 
as Nichetti blends different levels of reality, and mixes color and 
black-and-white. Pirandello rarely did it better and in "The Purple Rose of 
Cairo," Woody Allen didn't get this nuttily complex. 
</P>
<P>
Nichetti has two acting roles here. With very round glasses and a very large 
mustache that makes him look just like the Cartoon Chef (late of the Times' 
pages), he is the hapless Nichetti, director of the neo-realist classic "The 
Icicle Thief." Without the mustache and glasses, he is Antonio, the film's lead 
character, head of a brave little unemployed family consisting of young mama 
Maria (Caterina Sylos Labini), her heart set on a singing career; Bruno, their 
cherubic son of about 7, the only level head in the place; and a baby who by 
any standards leads a charmed life. 
</P>
<P>
Down at the television station where his film classic is being explained to 
death, "director" Nichetti is horrified to discover that it's also being 
pockmarked by color commercials. The worst is on the way -- a blinding 
electrical pop at the station suddenly deposits one of the commercials' stars, 
a 6-foot English-speaking blond model in her ice-blue thong bathing suit, in 
the middle of the black-and-white purity of this gritty film, where her 
presence raises every sort of hell with the characters' lives. And so the 
entanglements on every level begin. 
</P>
<P>
Details have been made as authentic as possible -- the parodies are so deadly 
close to their sources they could almost pass for the real thing. Hasn't that 
ice cream jingle been rattling around our TV sets -- and our brains? Wasn't Don 
Italo, that most resourceful of priests, a staple from DeSica films? It's this 
accuracy, plus inspired acting all around, that gives the film its edge of 
perfection for movie buffs. But even if Neapolitan ice cream is the closest 
you've been to anything Italian, "The Icicle Thief" is still miraculously 
funny. 
</P>
<P>
The final fillip is the inherent charm of everyone involved. The friendship 
between young Bruno, the pint-size man of the house, and the model (Heidi 
Komarek), works partly because of Bruno's hilarious matter-of-factness with 
this towering exotic and partly because she's not a lioness, but a pussycat. 
</P>
<P>
"Director" Nichetti is beguiling, even when he is charged with comic fury about 
the way his characters are beginning to live lives of their own. (Those with 
good memories will remember Nichetti as the beleaguered live-action artist from 
the otherwise all-animated feature "Allegro Non Troppo" -- and he was pretty 
funny there, too.) "The Icicle Thief" is a lot like its creator -- slight, 
ingenious and sneakily irresistible.

A BRAIN-DEAD 'WANT IT WEDNESDAY'; 
</P>
<P>
THE PRODUCTION AT THE ANAHEIM CULTURAL ARTS CENTER LACKS HUMOR AND ORIGINALITY 
IN ITS ATTEMPT TO SATIRIZE THE TELEVISION INDUSTRY. 
</P>

<P>
"I Want It Wednesday," the new play at the Anaheim Cultural Arts Center through 
Sunday, takes its title from an old Hollywood line that might have been coined 
by any number of harried shlockmeisters: "I don't want it good. I want it 
Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
In this brain-dead production, which purports to satirize the television 
industry, that line passes for the sort of witticism that is supposed to sound 
fresh. But the entire script of "I Want It Wednesday" is so stale it would be 
lousy any day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Could there possibly be anything more dated than jokes about Mr. T and "The 
A-Team"? Or about a movie-of-the-week "to star the Dallas Cowgirls and the 
Chippendale dancers"? Could there be a more antediluvian cliche than the 
central figure of this comedy: a blowhard TV producer whose ditsy wife drinks 
too much, shops too much and owns a losing racehorse named Zsa Zsa. 
</P>
<P>
This play not only wastes what little energy it has on characters who are 
brainstorming a prime-time soap called "Sugar" -- Jack Lord as plantation 
patriarch would head an incestuous family of Hawaii sugar tycoons -- but also 
devotes most of the second act to a game-show parody called "The $64-Million 
Question." 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder that the playwright Lew Riley does not want to be associated with 
this fossil and has asked the producer-director Jeffrey D. Ault to take his 
name off it. 
</P>
<P>
Riley has written The Times that Ault's staging bears "only a passing 
resemblance to my copyrighted script" because of wholesale changes made without 
his authorization. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ault has refused to comply. He has issued a press release 
claiming that he "sees no justification" for removing Riley's name. 
</P>
<P>
Ault insists that, despite their "artistic differences" over casting and 
"dialogue that has been added to the original script . . . through 
improvisational exercises," he has remained faithful to Riley's intent. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of who might be right, the staged material of "I Want It Wednesday" 
seems beyond redemption. 
</P>
<P>
If Riley's script bears just an iota of resemblance to the production, which is 
more than likely, he ought to burn it. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, that doesn't leave much room for amateur performers to distinguish 
themselves. And, to be sure, they don't. But Carla Jones, who has the most 
theatrical role as the TV producer's wife, does manage a not-bad impersonation 
of a drunk. 
</P>
<P>
'I WANT IT WEDNESDAY'

<P>
 Be-Bop Burgers and Pinky's Hamburger Grill are part of a wave of "nostalgia" 
hamburger joints engulfing Orange County, and both are longer on atmosphere 
than food. The Be-Bop burger is a good value, a full quarter-pound of lean beef 
on a seeded bun that just drips with condiments. Pinky's beach burgers are 
charcoal-grilled and really taste good. Other sandwiches in both restaurants 
are less appealing. Luckily, both restaurants exude energy, plus the mindless 
fun of the '50s and '60s.

Burrell's Rib Cage, 305 N. Hesperian St., Santa Ana. (714) 835-9936. Open 
daily, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Also at 1701 E. McFadden Ave., J, Santa Ana. (714)

<P>
 Wanna sample of what Magic Johnson and Richard Nixon say is the area's best 
barbecue? Come on down to Burrell's and see what the shouting is about. You'll 
eat from plastic boxes in a dark, smoky room, and you'll probably get sauce on 
your shirt. The good news is you won't care. Beef brisket is as soft and lean 
as a baby's cheek, and chopped pork shoulder is a symphony of textures. Save 
room for the especially terrific homemade sausage, crumbly and charred crisp. 
It's what a food critic lives for.

The Original Pancake House, 1418 E. Lincoln Ave., Anaheim. (714) 693-1390. Open 
Tuesdays through Sundays from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
The Original Pancake House is one of the very best restaurants in Orange 
County. Just ask anyone who has eaten there. All the batters are made with 
sourdough yeast and come straight from the grill -- light, finely textured and 
complex. The Belgian waffles are eggy and crispy, and the apple pancake, a 
giant golden puff with a cinnamon-glaze topping, is one step away from nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
Bayou St. John, 320 Main St., Seal Beach. (213) 431-2298. Open daily from 5 to 
10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Bayou St. John in quiet Seal Beach is Orange County's only bona fide Cajun 
restaurant. The boom has faded, but not the delights of this cuisine. Indulge 
yourself with such specialties as homemade gumbo, full of hidden flavors; 
oysters Rousseau, a rich appetizer with cheese, bacon, cream sauce and spicy 
tomato; and stuffed trout, pan-fried in pure butter. Blackened items are a 
must. Seafoods are flown in from the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
China Palms, Fullerton Metro Center, 104 W. Orangethorpe Ave., Fullerton. (714) 
526-2196. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 
p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Joe Ling put a palm tree in the middle of his restaurant, an airy, ultra-modern 
dining room in Fullerton's spanking-new Metro Center. But there is nothing 
tropical about the solid pan-Chinese food he serves, made in one of the most 
accomplished Chinese kitchens around. Cold dishes, dumplings and first-rate 
soups make perfect beginnings. Honey-glazed bananas, plunged steaming into an 
ice-filled bowl tableside, make perfect endings. The goodies you can have in 
between are too numerous to mention. 
</P>
<P>
Five Feet, 328 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-4955. Open Sundays 
through Thursdays, 5 to 10 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 5 to 11 p.m.; lunch 
served Fridays only, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Owner Michael Kang has some of the most compelling art around decorating this 
restaurant's somber, postmodern walls, and he serves plates of food very nearly 
as artful. Dishes of pot stickers or steamed dumpling are no better than you 
would get in any Chinese restaurant, but the eclectic lamb, scallop and catfish 
entrees demonstrate Kang's flair. The catfish is particularly fine. 
</P>
<P>
Stix, 28251 Crown Valley Parkway at the Center at Ranch Miguel, Laguna Niguel. 
(714) 831-7849. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; from 
11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. $ 
</P>
<P>
Stix is a bright, airy, mirror-lined, new Chinese restaurant where the cooking 
offers few surprises but is straightforward and safe: no MSG, high-quality oils 
like peanut and sesame -- you get it. The various kung paos, pan-fried 
dumplings and twice-cooked pork, may lack the hotness and brio they have in 
Chinatown or Monterey Park, but added color and crunch make up for it. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Truffle, 1767 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-9858. Open 
Tuesdays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; Tuesdays through 
Thursdays from 6 to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Truffle is an eccentric restaurant with an eclectic menu that defies 
rhythm or logic. Chef Alan Greeley is whimsical; he cooks for the sheer 
pleasure of it, and it mostly tastes terrific. Bay shrimp cocktail Yucatan is 
like a combination gazpacho-ceviche, with tiny shrimp and chunky pieces of 
avocado immobilized in a thick, tangy puree of tomato and chili. Broiled 
marinated skirt steak with pinto beans and cactus is a triumph. Nothing else on 
the menu will prepare you for it. There is a wide selection of premium wines 
and bistro-like desserts. The ambience is relaxed and casual.

'DEA' FIGHTS DRUGS WITH STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fox newcomer "DEA" is the most stylish and atmospheric crime series to come 
along in years. It uses a cinema verite documentary technique to create an 
authentically grimy urban setting for "reality inspired" stories depicting the 
government's fight to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bullets and bleeps fly -- Fox is the first network to bleep its own shows when 
it comes to coarse street language -- on tonight's premiere (9 p.m. on Channels 
11 and 6), which introduces a special New York task force of the federal Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) as it strikes at an operation of the infamous 
Colombian drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
On paper, "DEA" is another of those formulaic, elite crime-fighting units 
headed by a hard-nosed authority figure with a heart of mush. In this case, 
he's special agent Bill Stadler (Tom Mason), whose young charges (Jenny Gago, 
Byron Keith Minns, David Wohl and Chris Stanley) reflect the usual, 
demographically balanced ethnic mix. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the serialized plot for the initial episodes of "DEA" is right out of 
"Miami Vice." It's also a tad preachy and sanctimonious. 
</P>
<P>
What separates "DEA" from other such series in its genre, however, is its cast 
(Gago is an especially interesting actress, for example) and its look. 
</P>
<P>
Fluid minicams are at work here, delivering intentionally herky-jerky and 
grainy footage that creates a mood of grim spontaneity and gives "DEA" a 
distinct character. The device works much of the time but occasionally gets in 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
This is especially true in the second episode, whose story -- tracing the 
flight of a drug dealer who had killed a DEA agent in the first episode -- is 
so fuzzy that it looks like it was shot through gauze. You got a clearer 
picture from Mayor Marion Barry's sting video. 
</P>
<P>
Too much of an interesting thing? Yes. Because of its style, however, "DEA" is 
an interesting series.

A JOKER IN THE DECK; 
</P>
<P>
RICHARD THOMPSON ADDS FARCE TO ACOUSTIC SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Thompson's talent has always been aces. Now he seems to have added a 
joker or two to his hand as well. 
</P>
<P>
The British folk-rocker's solo acoustic show at the Coach House Wednesday night 
was a wonderful, two-hour grab bag of strong new songs, familiar pleasures and 
uncanny surprises. 
</P>
<P>
The familiar pleasures -- familiar, at least, to the cult of fans who know him 
as one of rock's richest one-stop repositories for singing, songwriting and 
guitar-playing excellence -- included Thompson's assured weave of tragedy and 
pathos, ire and droll wit, a regard for rock's traditional roots, and a 
willingness to explore beyond their bounds. The joker in the deck was a 
seemingly new-found knack for farce. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson always has been a pretty funny guy when he wants to be, especially on 
stage. But his sense of humor typically has been dry and ironic, his musical 
jokes the sort that draw a grin or a chuckle, but not a roar. This time, 
Thompson used a new tune of his own and a couple of borrowed ones to provoke 
belly laughs. 
</P>
<P>
The show's first farcical installment was "Now That I Am Dead," written by John 
French for French, Frith, Kaiser and Thompson, a side-project consortium that 
allows Thompson to indulge some of his more offbeat passions. French, who knows 
a thing or two about offbeat passions from his days as Captain Beefheart's 
drummer, may have written the song with Thompson in mind. It's about a rocker 
who, after a lifetime of commercial neglect, finally wins wealth and fame. 
Unfortunately, this turnabout is posthumous. Thompson, who knows all about 
commercial neglect, played the dead star's role with wicked glee. Putting on a 
Vincent Price monster-mash vibrato punctuated by ghoulish cackles, he sang a 
succession of comic verses along the lines of "Now that I am boxed, they say my 
music rocks -- it's taken on a new appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Better, because it was even stranger, was Thompson's own "Psycho Street." The 
song depicted a very British neighborhood populated with lunatics and perverts 
beyond even David Lynch's ken: "A man sticks his neighbor's cat on the barbecue 
and turns on the gas and says: 'Are you going to talk, or am I going to get 
nasty?' " 
</P>
<P>
More than the lyrics, which were the product of a fertile mind testing the 
limits of its power of warped imagining, the music made this song a 
delightfully crazed novelty. Thompson delivered the verses with a donnish, 
"Masterpiece Theater" intonation that echoed Viv Stanshall's approach with the 
Bonzo Dog Band (that great, eccentric British humor-rock band of the 1960s that 
later spun off into the Rutles and various Monty Python productions). The 
chorus to "Psycho Street" was a jaunty, vaudevillian thing seemingly tailored 
for a barbershop quartet. Appended to all of that was some demonic, punkish 
guitar flailing and howling. It was a singular piece of music, to say the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
To show that he also can mine tradition for broad laughs, Thompson closed with 
a Louis Jordan song, "Don't Roll Those Bloodshot Eyes at Me," redone rockabilly 
style with a punch line in every verse. 
</P>
<P>
A feisty audience that was full of wisecracks and song requests helped loosen 
Thompson up to the point where the show took on a delightfully uncharted 
feeling. Asked to play the Who's "Substitute," a song he has done live in the 
past, Thompson instead embarked on a jokey, finger-snapping, a cappella 
rendition of "My Generation." Then, caught up in the spirit, he picked up his 
guitar and gave the old anthem a proper rocking -- and followed it for good 
measure with a burning, clenched "Substitute." 
</P>
<P>
Such antics gave the night a special, heady flavor, but Thompson, always more 
the tragedian than the comic, did not stint on emotional gravity. Running 
through his work is a deep sense that life is an agonizing business full of 
horrors and rife with moral outrages ranging from romantic betrayals to the 
exploitative rigging of whole social and economic systems. He painted those 
dark shades vividly, depicting the broken outcasts of "Down Where the Drunkards 
Roll" and wallowing in the utter hopelessness of "The End of the Rainbow." 
Thompson was especially strong and eloquent on "Wall of Death" with its 
determination to face and embrace life's most dangerous and precarious 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
The high quality of the five new, unrecorded songs Thompson included in his 
23-song set indicate that, at 41, he has suffered no creative let-up. The 
concert began with two excellent new numbers, "I Misunderstood," a fine lover's 
plaint, and "1952 Vincent Black Lightning," in which a fleet, springy, 
bluegrass-tinged guitar propelled the vibrant tale of a doomed outlaw biker -- 
a sort of "Bonnie and Clyde" on two wheels. 
</P>
<P>
As always, Thompson's guitar work was little short of astonishing. Few other 
rock guitarists can achieve the churning, obsessive quality with which he 
colored "Shoot Out the Lights" and "When the Spell is Broken." He accomplished 
it with lurching rhythmic shifts, sudden notes bent and held to the point of 
stress fracture, and inexorable, hammering bass figures like the Indian war 
dance thrum of "When the Spell is Broken" -- all harnessed for strictly 
expressive purposes, not mere show. The solo in "Down Where the Drunkards Roll" 
was a lovely display of lyricism, while the blazing country licks at the end of 
"Valerie" were propulsion personified. Thompson made his guitar sound like a 
train rumbling nearer and nearer, with whistles blowing. It was a fitting 
evocation from a rocker who, 22 years after his debut with Fairport Convention, 
still has his creative engines stoked and burning.

HATE CRIMES RISE SHARPLY, PANEL REPORTS; 
</P>
<P>
BIGOTRY: SIX-MONTH INCREASE IS STEEP ENOUGH TO WARRANT A SPECIAL MIDYEAR 
STATEMENT BY COUNTY HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION, WHICH SEES SITUATION WORSENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Residents of multiethnic Los Angeles County are finding it increasingly 
difficult to cope with one another's racial and cultural differences, according 
to a special report released Thursday by the county Human Relations Commission 
that shows a marked increase in hate crimes in the first six months of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
African-Americans, Latinos, Jews and Arab-Americans have had their homes 
vandalized and defaced with swastikas and racist graffiti, the commission 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
In other examples cited, two Latinos struck an Asian with bottles and hurled 
racial epithets at him; a cross was set aflame in front of a black family's 
Temple City home; a gay man who spoke on a radio program was threatened by two 
armed men who followed him home, and a Catholic church in Torrance was 
desecrated. 
</P>
<P>
In its report to the county Board of Supervisors, the commission noted that the 
hate crimes, motivated by racism, religious bigotry and intolerance of 
homosexuality, have been steadily rising across the county since 1986. Last 
year, 378 hate crimes were reported across the county. For the first half of 
this year, the figure is 272. 
</P>
<P>
The latest increase -- which commission officials say marks an "alarming" 32% 
increase over the same period last year -- was so dramatic that the commission 
believed it warranted a special midyear report, commission director Eugene 
Mornell said at a news briefing, noting that the commission usually issues the 
reports annually. Mornell predicted the situation "will get worse before it 
gets better." 
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increased intergroup tension to "population changes across 
the county" as well as to a rise in the general level of violent crime across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles County, no one group is a majority of the population anymore. 
This is a new situation we are going to have to learn to live with. This will 
take time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to see increased tension and hate crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Hate crimes have increasingly been directed at Asians and Latinos, though 
African-Americans, Jews and gays continue, by far, to be the prime targets, the 
report shows. Blacks are still victims in more than half of all racial crimes, 
Jews in nine of 10 religious hate crimes. But hate crimes against Asians more 
than tripled in the six months, to 23 from 7 for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
The incidence of crimes against gays remained nearly unchanged over that same 
period, but the level of violence increased substantially, the commission 
reported. Of the 50 incidents reported against gays during the first six months 
of the year, physical violence was reported in 41 cases. 
</P>
<P>
Young white males -- described by Mornell as the "most fearful, hostile, 
bigoted" segment of society -- have historically been the main perpetrators of 
hate crimes, he said. But, surprisingly, he added, more recent reports show 
that others have joined the ranks, showing that "bigotry is not isolated to any 
one group." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the rise in hate crimes can be attributed to rising tension resulting 
from the region's rapidly changing demographics, he said. Immigrants or ethnic 
groups that are new to a neighborhood are often the targets of "move-in 
violence" from more established neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The problem of hate crime is by no means Los Angeles County's alone, said 
Mornell, noting that hate crimes are on the rise across the nation. "We feel 
that we have a lower hate crime rate than some Eastern cities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that in a few areas of the county, principally the San Fernando Valley 
and Glendale, the hate-crime rate declined in the first six months of the year. 
Although he had no explanation for the decrease, he speculated that increased 
attention by Glendale police to this particular type of crime might help 
explain the improvement. He said Glendale investigators were able to arrest 
suspects in all but one such incident last year.

LITTLE SUPPORT FOR GATES' COMMENT; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: POLICE CHIEF'S STATEMENT THAT CASUAL USERS SHOULD BE SHOT DRAWS MUCH 
CRITICISM IN CRIME-RIDDEN RAMPART SECTION OF LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Flavia Lopez and Maria Castillo, two Roman Catholic nuns at Our Lady of Loretto 
parish, were praying Thursday for the soul of Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. 
Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Although their turn-of-the-century church and school sits in a high-crime zone, 
with drug addicts and dope dealers sharing the sidewalks with schoolchildren, 
the sisters were distressed by Gates' highly publicized comment that casual 
drug users "ought to be taken out and shot." 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible for him to say that," protested Sister Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's un-Christian!" Added Sister Lopez: "Only God can take life from us. Not 
anybody else. Not Chief Gates. The police should respect life." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting just west of downtown, the city's Rampart district is home to an 
open-all-hours drug trade surrounding MacArthur Park. It is the scene of 
drive-by shootings and Latino, Filipino and Korean gang warfare, a neighborhood 
where law-abiding citizens like Sisters Lopez and Castillo have learned to live 
with crime all around them. 
</P>
<P>
In short, it would seem to be a place where Gates' provocative suggestion, made 
in testimony Wednesday before a U.S. Senate panel in Washington, might be 
expected to find a sympathetic audience. It did not. 
</P>
<P>
The day after Gates' statement found many people who live and work in Rampart 
-- some of them even police officers -- in disagreement with the chief. In 
interviews, they expressed outrage, anger and fear that the city's top law 
enforcement officer would want to hurt -- rather than help -- people who smoke 
marijuana and commit other so-called victimless crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, of about 20 people contacted at a college campus, a Braille institute, 
a video arcade, outside the shops along bustling Vermont Avenue, and at the 
Catholic church-school complex on Union Avenue, only one -- a pool hall manager 
-- supported in any way Gates' remark that casual drug users be executed. 
</P>
<P>
Even Gates' lone supporter attached qualifications. The pool hall manager, who 
identified himself only as Nham D., did say that hard-core drug dealers should 
be shot on the spot, but added that recreational pot smokers should be spared 
the firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a serious drug dealer, why not?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
In running the Vermont Billiards this summer, the 24-year-old South Vietnamese 
immigrant described the frustrations of keeping the drug market out of his 
20-table pool room. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a heavy user, just shoot him," he said. "And shoot to kill." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, 
the first anniversary of the Bush Administration's war on drugs, the police 
chief said his harsh statements were targeted at those "who blast some pot on a 
casual basis," rather than heavy, needle-in-the-arm heroin junkies. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview outside the committee hearing, he said "'we're in a war" and 
even casual drug use "is treason." 
</P>
<P>
Starsky Hovsepian, who has run the College Arcade on Vermont for 10 years, said 
it is treasonous to suggest that weekend pot smokers be put to death. 
</P>
<P>
"A kid uses a little, so you kill the kid?" Hovsepian asked. "If somebody walks 
against a red light, do you kill him too? 
</P>
<P>
"What about the Constitution? What about constitutional rights?" 
</P>
<P>
Roger Martin once managed a hotel near MacArthur Park, where the drug dealers 
were so persistent that they broke the hotel windows, climbed fire escapes and 
scaled the building -- anything to get inside to sell their wares. "It got so 
bad," Martin said, "I had to have an Uzi in the office." 
</P>
<P>
He said his cousin was stabbed to death by a drug dealer on Labor Day last 
year. He said police cars cruise by every day, but the officers seldom get out 
and deal with the problems. "They're only sightseeing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What they should be doing, Martin insisted, is arresting the drug dealers. Stop 
the big-time supplier, he said. "You do away with the heavy dealers, and that's 
when the casual users will stop, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Los Angeles City College, Oyegeko Ottoman, 34, a second-year electronics 
student, said he experimented with marijuana in his younger days. Today he 
sports dreadlocks and wears rainbow-colored slacks, and he said he shuns drugs. 
</P>
<P>
And his sentiments about chief Gates echoed those of the two nuns from the Our 
Lady of Loretto school. 
</P>
<P>
"Gates shouldn't play God," he said. "He didn't make man. So he shouldn't kill 
man. I say love and peace." 
</P>
<P>
Even at the Rampart Division police station, where beat cops battle daily with 
the impact of drugs and the endless calls for service at burglaries, street 
robberies and auto thefts, officers seemed hesitant, flabbergasted and, in some 
cases, downright unwilling to back up their chief. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a pretty strong statement he made, but it's only his point of view," 
said Officer Rene Silva. "It's not mine." Silva was raised in Rampart. He 
remembers a time when he rode his bicycle through the neighborhood on his way 
to play at MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has worked as a police officer in Rampart for 22 years. And today he 
would not even consider riding a bike through this part of town. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he is opposed to trying to end drug abuse by killing those who abuse 
drugs the least. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a drug war we're in here," he said. "Oh yes. And sometimes it seems 
like what we're doing to combat it is just like shoveling sand into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"But the chief, he's speaking out of desperation. Drug users ought to be dealt 
with, and severely, but I don't think that far." 
</P>
<P>
Standing at the police station counter next to Silva was Paul Malevitz. In his 
regular, 9-to-5 job, he works as a high school teacher, and he is well aware of 
how some troubled youths stumble onto and experiment with drugs, like marijuana 
and speed. 
</P>
<P>
But Malevitz also moonlights as an LAPD reserve officer, and here he has 
witnessed firsthand how even casual drug use, by increasing the demand for more 
drugs, can fuel the crime wave. He believes Gates must have been merely 
thinking out loud when he testified at the congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like if a little boy had a birthday wish," Malevitz explained. "It's like 
the boy wished that all the bad people would go away." 
</P>
<P>
The view from Rampart on Thursday was that things aren't that simple.

DEPUTY D.A. GROUP VOTES 'NO CONFIDENCE' IN REINER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An organization representing Los Angeles County prosecutors announced Thursday 
a vote of no confidence in Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner's removal of a veteran 
prosecutor from the Menendez brothers murder case -- an unprece-dented action 
by the group. 
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of the Assn. of Deputy District Attorneys voted 
unanimously to rebuke Reiner Wednesday night after both Reiner and former 
Menendez prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Elliott Alhadeff, appeared before the 
group. Five of the 18 board members were absent. 
</P>
<P>
A one-sentence press release from association president David Ross said 
Thursday that the association "lacks confidence in the district attorney's 
judgment" in pulling the prosecutor off the case that has drawn worldwide media 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Alhadeff, 52, a 24-year veteran of the office, earlier was selected to be 
honored next week as the association's prosecutor of the year. 
</P>
<P>
He was removed as lead prosecutor on Aug. 16 and replaced by Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Pamela Ferrero, one of the prosecutors in the second McMartin Pre-School 
molestation trial. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner was unavailable for comment, but his spokeswoman, Sandi Gibbons, said 
Alhadeff was pulled from the case after several briefings with Reiner. "The 
district attorney has a responsibility to the people of Los Angeles County to 
put the best possible prosecution team on a case," Gibbons said. "That's what 
he gets paid for." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gibbons would not say what Reiner's problem was with Alhadeff, who has 
won a string of court decisions favorable to the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Menendez, 22, and his brother, Erik Menendez, 19, are charged in the 1989 
shotgun murders of their wealthy parents. In the early phases of the 
investigation before the brothers were arrested and charges filed, Ferrero was 
assigned to the case. She had to give it up when she was tapped for the 
McMartin retrial. 
</P>
<P>
The association has no power over Reiner, except in the arena of public 
opinion, and has been supportive of the district attorney. The board voted to 
endorse Reiner over incumbent Robert Philibosian when Reiner first won office 
in 1984 -- a major boost for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
And when Reiner announced plans to seek reelection in 1988, he was encircled by 
smiling members of the Assn. of Deputy District Attorneys board, which endorsed 
him again. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion is divided on whether the group's new willingness to publicly criticize 
Reiner is an isolated incident, an indication of deep dissatisfaction within 
the office or the result of his vulnerability after his defeat in the state 
attorney general primary in June. Most board members contacted by The Times 
refused to comment for the record. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it should be understood the action that the board took is 
absolutely unprecedented," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Marsh Goldstein, a board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said the removal of a respected prosecutor from a high-publicity case -- 
without stating the reasons -- is "bad for morale" and calls Reiner's 
competence into question. . . . We question his judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Ross characterized the vote, which followed a spirited discussion, as 
significant. "It's a major move . . . to disagree publicly with your boss." 
</P>
<P>
Ross, Alhadeff and other members of the association board emphasized that their 
dispute was not with their fellow prosecutor, Ferrero. 
</P>
<P>
As Alhadeff tells it, he was called into Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg 
Thompson's office the day before leaving for vacation. A press release 
announcing his removal was read to him. The office's official position was that 
Ferrero wanted the case back. 
</P>
<P>
Upon returning from vacation, Alhadeff said he found that many of his 
colleagues were upset on his behalf. In the past few days, Alhadeff met with 
Thompson, then with Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was told his competence was not at issue. "I walked in there 
concerned it may be a reflection on my competence and reputation and walked out 
of there being assured it was not. . . . I think there may have been a 
personality problem," Alhadeff said. 
</P>
<P>
If so, Alhadeff said, it was a problem he did not know about until it was too 
late. "I'm disappointed I was removed from the case," he said.

PLAN DRAWN UP FOR PURCHASE OF FRYMAN CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
LAND: RUSTIC PROPERTY IN STUDIO CITY WOULD BECOME A PARK INSTEAD OF HOUSING 
PROJECT IF STATE AGENCY AGREES. CITY WOULD PUT UP $2 MILLION OF THE 
$10.9-MILLION PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
City officials have reached an agreement with a developer for the purchase of 
Fryman Canyon for $10.9 million to turn the rustic, steeply sloped Studio City 
land into a park, saving it from development as a luxury housing project. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley and Councilman Michael Woo plan today to unveil the proposal, 
which calls for the city to put up $2 million, private contributors to raise 
$300,000 and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to kick in the final $8.6 
million, according to conservancy Executive Director Joe Edmiston. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city's agreement with developer Fred Sahadi must first be approved 
by the state parks agency's seven-member board of directors before it can go 
forward. Edmiston and Carole Stevens, chairman of the conservancy's board, 
raised doubts Thursday night over whether the deal will be acceptable to the 
conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's office said in a press release Thursday that the "city and the 
developer have agreed upon the purchase price and the amount of funds the city 
and private individuals will contribute to save Fryman Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
City officials could not be reached for comment on what seemed to be the end to 
a months-long controversy over the 63-acre canyon property, owned by Sahadi and 
his wife, Helen. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said she has asked the state attorney general's office for a formal 
opinion about the legality of purchasing a property for an amount in excess of 
a state-sanctioned appraised value. The conservancy has said the canyon is 
worth only $8.7 million, and Sahadi has had it appraised at $13.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said she has asked the state to conduct a new appraisal of the property 
and Edmiston indicated that if it shows a higher value, the conservancy might 
go ahead with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's zero chance the conservancy will go forward without a 
(revised) state appraisal -- it would be such a great break from tradition," 
Edmiston said. "If we start buying land without appraisals then there's no end 
to it. Then you, as a landowner, just go political if you don't like the 
appraised price." 
</P>
<P>
The canyon has been at the center of controversy since last March when Bradley 
and Woo urged state and federal officials to intervene to block Sahadi's 
project, claiming it would disturb a natural habitat surrounding a stream. 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks, environmental activists -- with backing from Bradley's office -- 
urged the city to declare the canyon a cultural-historic landmark. The city's 
Cultural Heritage Commission granted the designation, but city approval of that 
status is still pending before the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists also staged protests at woodsy Fryman Canyon. In one 
memorable incident last month, an activist used her Mercedes-Benz sedan to 
block contractors from entering the canyon while she contacted city officials 
by car phone. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi recently began posting no-trespassing signs and erecting a fence around 
the property, which is crossed by a popular hiking trail that until recently 
was believed to be firmly owned by the conservancy.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRANDO'S LAWYER SEEKING CHARGE OF 
MANSLAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christian Brando's defense lawyer has asked a court to reduce the murder charge 
against him to manslaughter. Another motion, filed this week in Superior Court, 
seeks to suppress a tape-recorded police interview with Brando, son of actor 
Marlon Brando. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Robert Shapiro will argue the motions before Superior Court Judge 
Robert Thomas on Sept. 14, said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district 
attorney. Brando, 32, pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the May 16 
shooting of Dag Drollet, 26, the boyfriend of Christian's half-sister, 
Cheyenne. Drollet was found dead at Marlon Brando's estate in the Santa Monica 
Mountains. Trial is set for Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro argued unsuccessfully during a preliminary hearing that the murder 
charge should be reduced to manslaughter because there was no evidence that 
Brando intended to kill Drollet. However, prosecutors have cited reports that 
Drollet was clutching a TV remote control device and other items when his body 
was discovered.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LOURDES BAIRD SWORN IN AS NEW U.S. ATTORNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before judges, prosecutors and lawyers assembled in a courtroom of the federal 
courthouse in Los Angeles, the new U.S. attorney for the Central District of 
California, Lourdes G. Baird, was officially sworn into office on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Baird, 55, a native of Ecuador and a former Los Angeles County Superior Court 
judge, was nominated by President Bush last May to replace U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Robert C. Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
Taking into account Baird's Latino background and the fact that Southern 
California is an ethnic melting pot with a large Latino population, her former 
law partner, Molly Munger, said that "Lourdes is symbolic of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Baird, who raised a family before pursuing a legal career, gave credit to other 
women in her profession. "I clearly got here hanging on to the skirts of my 
predecessors," she said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BROAD-BASED GROUP BACKS PROPOSITION ON 
HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A broad-based group of politicians, bankers and anti-poverty advocates Thursday 
urged voter approval of ballot measure Proposition K, a $100-million housing 
bond issue that would renovate 5,000 earthquake-unsafe apartment units, create 
homeless shelters for more than 1,000 people and provide loans to struggling 
first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson said the measure is critical to efforts 
to save badly needed affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
A similar measure in 1988 failed by only a few thousand votes. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), speaking at a dilapidated Skid Row 
slum hotel that officials said would not withstand a major earthquake, 
predicted widespread voter support. "Almost one year ago . . . there was a 
massive earthquake in Northern California which resulted in $6 billion in 
damage, 63 deaths," he said. "That earthquake was a grim reminder of what 
could, and frankly will, occur here."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: ATTORNEY GENERAL; 
</P>
<P>
LUNGREN MODIFIES TV ATTACK ON SMITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Republican state attorney general candidate Dan Lungren has modified the 
wording of his first TV campaign ad, which was criticized in editorials by 
major California newspapers as "dirty," "exploitative" and "a cheap shot" 
against his Democratic opponent. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second spot skewers San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith for accepting a 
plea bargain from a onetime campaign contributor accused of drug and sex 
charges involving teen-age prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Since the ad was unveiled early last week, editorials in the San Francisco 
Examiner, the Sacramento Bee and The Times have said that it unfairly indicates 
that Smith approved a light sentence for the influential defendant, Donald 
Werby, in exchange for campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The Examiner, in its editorial, wrote that "in essence, Lungren is accusing 
Smith of a crime, of throwing a case. This marks a new low in campaign ads. . . 
. Not a shred of evidence is offered." 
</P>
<P>
The new ad makes clear that Smith has returned Werby's campaign contributions. 
Lungren said Thursday that as a result of questions posed by reporters, he 
changed his ad even before the first editorials were published last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We were frankly surprised when some people said that to us," said Lungren. 
"None of us even conceived of the idea it would be looked at as an allegation 
of a quid pro quo or that there was a bribe accepted by Arlo Smith." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's campaign manager, Marc Dann, demanded Thursday that Lungren publicly 
apologize for the ad. "Dan Lungren's ads are an insult to the intelligence of 
the voters," said Dann. "He is a liar and he hasn't the guts to face up to it 
when he gets caught." 
</P>
<P>
Werby, contending that he is innocent, also requested this week that Lungren 
remove the ad from the air. Indicted last year by a San Francisco grand jury on 
22 felony drug, sex and bribery counts, Werby said he pleaded guilty to four 
misdemeanor charges only "to preserve as much as possible the shattered privacy 
of myself and my family." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Lungren, Werby, a multimillionaire partner in the Four Seasons 
Clift Hotel and Gray Line bus tours, added that he was prosecuted despite 
substantial evidence of his innocence "precisely because I had been a (Smith) 
campaign contributor." 
</P>
<P>
"Smith was so terrified of appearing to go easy on me that he brought a case 
which was untenable," Werby wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who had received $7,500 from Werby, his brother and their businesses 
during the formative stages of his campaign last year, returned the 
contributions long before the plea bargain was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the furor, Lungren said he still stands "by the accuracy of the 
original ad." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>
<P>
The race: Attorney general. Whose ad? Republican Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren has modified his first TV campaign ad, which has been branded deceptive 
in several major newspaper editorials. The 30-second spot attacks his 
Democratic opponent, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, for accepting a 
misdemeanor plea bargain from one-time campaign contributor Donald Werby, who 
had been indicted on 22 felony drug, sex and bribery counts involving teen-age 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of the Lungren ad, with an analysis by Times staff writer Paul 
Feldman: 
</P>
<P>
Original ad: "San Francisco D.A. Arlo Smith allowed Werby to plea bargain. No 
jail, just some community service and a fine. This, after Werby and his brother 
had given thousands to Smith's political campaign." 
</P>
<P>
The modified ad: "San Francisco D.A. Arlo Smith allowed Werby to plea-bargain. 
No jail, just some community service and a fine. Although Smith returned 
Werby's political contribution, he should have turned the case over to the 
state attorney general because of potential conflicts of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Analysis: Werby, his brother and their businesses donated $7,500 to Smith's 
campaign before Werby's indictment in August, 1989. The Smith campaign returned 
most of the contributions before Werby, 63, was indicted. Despite the Werbys' 
initial contributions and the fact that Smith's campaign manager was called to 
testify before the Werby grand jury, Smith maintains that his office had no 
legal problem prosecuting the case.

MIKE DOWNEY: BRUINS MIGHT HAVE A WINNER WITH NGUYEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ambling across UCLA's campus in an Angel cap and a "Bo Knows" shirt, weeks 
before classes begin, Mike seems pretty much your basic, standard-issue 
football player, a fresh young freshman down from Oregon, signing up for 
engineering courses and sitting in at team meetings, not unlike the other guys 
Mike mixes with daily at practice who were born in Hollywood or Bakersfield or 
even places as distant as Fairbanks, Alaska, and London, England. 
</P>
<P>
Only Mike was born in the Mekong Delta. 
</P>
<P>
His surname is Nguyen, pronounced, "Win." 
</P>
<P>
His given first name is Huy, pronounced, "We." 
</P>
<P>
He was bundled at 2 1/2 in the arms of his parents as they fled Saigon, the 
night the city fell to the attacking Communist troops of the North Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
And if, as an almost-All-American boy of 17, Mike sets foot on the field 
Saturday to play some football for UCLA, he will become, so far as anybody is 
able to tell, the first Vietnamese refugee at any major American college to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Nguyen has made the squad. This much he knows. The wide receiver knows 
that he will wear jersey No. 81 -- just like his favorite pro, the Raiders' Tim 
Brown -- at the Rose Bowl for the Bruins' season opener against Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
What he won't know until he gets to the stadium is when he will see action -- 
now, or a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
"I just talked to the coaches," Nguyen said Thursday in Westwood, "and they 
said they might not be able to save me." 
</P>
<P>
No, they might have to use him. Let him play right away, less than four months 
from his high school graduation in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Some freshmen get a year off. They redshirt. They apprentice for a year, then 
stick around for four more. And UCLA's coaches might not mind doing that with 
Mike Nguyen, especially if they want to spend the next four seasons saying, as 
often as possible,"We Win." 
</P>
<P>
But the player cupboard is only so deep. An injury already has cost the Bruins 
one of their best big-play receivers, Scott Miller. Another ailment is nagging 
split end Paul Richardson. The new starting quarterback, Jim Bonds, will have 
enough on his mind solving Oklahoma's defense without having a shortage of 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
So, Nguyen will stand on the sideline and see what happens. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has to point the way to the huddle. Nguyen has been a linebacker, a 
running back, a defensive back and a receiver in his scholastic career. As a 
senior at Franklin High School, he caught 53 passes, rushed for nearly 400 
yards, scored 14 touchdowns, returned kickoffs and punts and played free safety 
on defense. Stanford recruited him to play in the secondary. His qualifications 
to enroll there included a 3.9 grade-point average, which got him into the 
National Honor Society. 
</P>
<P>
And without even being aware of it at first, Mike Nguyen was becoming a heroic 
figure to others of Vietnamese origins, near and far. Sometimes his mother made 
him aware of it; other times it was his teachers or friends, who had heard 
tales of Mike's growing popularity, a state of affairs that startled him more 
than anybody, since Mike thinks of himself as little more than just another 
student-athlete and Oregon teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"I never give much thought to being Vietnamese, but I've been made to see how 
much it matters to some people," he said. "The other day, I think my mother 
heard from somebody in Pennsylvania, wishing me luck or something. I don't 
consider myself all that unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Among the allies Mike will have, whether he plays or not, in the stands 
Saturday will be Hoang Tran, his mother. Someday she will move permanently to 
the Los Angeles area, her son believes, because of its large Asian populace. 
Until his sisters finish school, she will remain in Oregon, where more than 
13,000 Vietnamese refugees reside. 
</P>
<P>
Mike is no expert on his heritage. He doesn't speak the language, doesn't make 
a special point of keeping up with it, or looking back on it. He wasn't 
particularly aware of the Little Saigon community in Garden Grove, but seemed 
pleased at the mention that he might find his UCLA career of interest there. 
</P>
<P>
When Mike's mom was his age, she married a South Vietnamese naval officer, Hung 
Nguyen. When she was 6, she was bloodied and nearly killed by shrapnel from a 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Her son was born in wartime. Around midnight on April 29, 1975, Saigon came 
under siege. Reluctant to leave her homeland, Hoang Tran obeyed her husband at 
gunpoint. They carried Mike and his baby sister to the river, where a ship was 
about to set out for the South China Sea. They had to fight their way on board, 
nearly becoming separated in the process. 
</P>
<P>
The family sailed to the Philippines, then to Guam, then to California. For six 
months, they called Camp Pendleton their home. Then they moved to Oregon, where 
Mike's parents worked as gardener and maid to a wealthy family. 
</P>
<P>
It has not been an easy life. Mike's father died at 39 of injuries suffered in 
a motorcycle spill, but not before spending 2 1/2 years immobilized and mute. 
His mother had a highway accident of her own that required back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Through sheer will and hard work, the Nguyen family persevered. Now Mike's mom 
runs her own business, an employment agency. His sisters are straight-A 
students. And Mike is about to begin a collegiate career that he hopes will 
take him to the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Getting there won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
But that has never stopped the Nguyen family before.

O, WHAT A PLACE IT WAS; 
</P>
<P>
PART OF ONTARIO MOTOR SPEEDWAY BECOMES A GRADE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago Thursday, the first California 500 for Indy cars was run at 
Ontario Motor Speedway before 180,233 spectators, called at the time the 
largest attendance at any sporting event in California. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McElreath, driving a backup Coyote-Ford owned by A.J. Foyt, won the race at 
an average speed of 160.106 m.p.h. and collected $156,000 from a purse of 
$727,500. 
</P>
<P>
The attendance, the speed and the payoff were never bettered at Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
OMS, a $35-million state-of-the-art race track that had risen from the dusty 
vineyards of Cucamonga, was called the Taj Mahal of motor racing. There had 
been nothing like it before -- nor since. 
</P>
<P>
It is gone now, nothing remaining on the site alongside Interstate 10 between 
Haven and Milliken avenues but a small pile of dirt -- only a hint of the giant 
berm that supported the three-story building that looked out over the 2 
1/2-mile track with its two infield lakes. 
</P>
<P>
It is as if someone with a giant eraser has scrubbed it off the face of the 
earth. The erasing happened 10 years ago, when the Chevron Land and Development 
Co. purchased the bankrupt site and razed the racing facility to make way for 
its Ontario Center, a master-planned blend of office buildings, retail 
businesses, hotels, restaurants and residential developments. 
</P>
<P>
But the memory of Sept. 6, 1970, and the magnificent racing facility that 
lasted a scant 10 years has been perpetuated at the Ontario Center in, of all 
places, an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
The Ontario Center School, located on what was once the west parking lot for 
the race track, was dedicated Thursday to the premise of "Winning Through 
Education." The logo of OMS, known as the "Big O," has been taken over by the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"The raceway theme has been used throughout the school," school principal 
Donald Nicholson said. "The central hall is circular, similar to the race 
track, and speedway graphics can be seen in the classrooms." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the kindergarten wing has green flags on its walls, signifying 
the start of the educational race. And the sixth-grade area is adorned with 
checkered flags -- the finish line. Other rooms have blue and yellow "move 
over" motifs. 
</P>
<P>
Three flagpoles in front of the school are from Ontario Motor Speedway. The 
school also hopes to acquire the original bricks of Victory Circle at OMS. They 
are reported to be in the basement of the Ontario City Hall, where they were 
taken when the bulldozers and the wrecking ball took over. 
</P>
<P>
"We found on past elementary school projects that creating a design motif 
really gives the students and teachers something to identify with," said 
Gaylaird Christopher, project architect for Wolff-Lang-Christopher, the 
school's designers. "It was thought that the school should be reminiscent of 
the speedway." 
</P>
<P>
McElreath was at the dedication, having come from his home in Arlington, Tex., 
for the occasion. So was Parnelli Jones, a member of the original OMS board of 
directors and once president of the speedway. 
</P>
<P>
And so were the 550 students of the new school, all wearing blue T-shirts with 
the school's logo and the motto, "Winning Through Education." 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be back here again, but I wish it was to go to the race track," 
McElreath said. "That was the best in the world, no doubt about it, and it's a 
real shame it wasn't saved by someone in racing. There'll probably never be one 
built again like Ontario." 
</P>
<P>
McElreath, 62, was wearing the 500 winner's ring from Ontario, with its Big O 
centerpiece, and looked fit enough to climb into a car and go racing. 
</P>
<P>
"How long has it been since you raced?" a school official asked McElreath. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Monday," he said, grinning as he caught the shocked look on the face of 
his questioner. "I haven't driven an Indy car since 1983 -- I only gave them up 
because they got too expensive and sponsors were too hard to find -- and I gave 
up sprint cars about three years ago, but I still drive my modified in 
dirt-track races. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to DuQuoin (Ill.) for a race Labor Day, but I hit the wall during 
practice and didn't make the race. Most of the time I run on little tracks 
around Waco and Ft. Worth and Dallas, places like the Devil's Bowl where they 
run modifieds on a half-mile." 
</P>
<P>
McElreath drove the car in which he won the 500 only twice. The first time was 
in the 1970 Indy 500, where he qualified it late on the final day and had to 
start 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real good car, just like the one A.J. was driving, and I passed eight 
guys on the first lap and finished fifth," he recalled. "It was just a one-race 
deal, and I had talked to Jack Brabham about driving his car at Ontario, so I 
wasn't thinking about A.J. until he called me not long before the race. I 
didn't have things set with Brabham so I told A.J. I'd take it. 
</P>
<P>
"Late in the race when I was running about third and I saw LeeRoy (Yarbrough) 
in front, I thought maybe I'd made the wrong choice because he was in Brabham's 
car. But then his car quit and I felt better about the whole deal." 
</P>
<P>
Al Unser, in the Ford-powered car he had driven to victory that year at 
Indianapolis, one owned by Parnelli Jones and Vel Miletich, dominated most of 
the race. Late in the running, after Peter Revson had lost nine minutes in the 
pits, Unser had a two-lap lead. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't anybody could touch Al that day," McElreath said. "But it was 
real hot and his engine gave out, and that gave some of the rest of us a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
It was so hot that only eight cars finished. Yarbrough led with nine laps 
remaining when his engine expired. That moved Art Pollard to the front, with 
McElreath close behind. Shortly after Pollard took over, Foyt hit the 
fourth-turn wall and brought out the yellow flag. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like the race might end on the yellow and it if did, Pollard would 
win," McElreath said. "A.J. knew I was right behind him and had qualified a lot 
faster, so he jumped out of his wrecked car and helped the emergency crew get 
it off the track. When we got the green (flag), Art and I passed each other two 
or three times before I got ahead to stay before the last lap." 
</P>
<P>
McElreath's personal share of the purse came to $62,353, the standard driver's 
40% of the winning payoff. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only thing I got out of winning," he said. "I didn't get any good 
offers for rides, no celebrity status and no deals. I never drove that car 
again. It's in the museum at Indianapolis now." 
</P>
<P>
McElreath raced six more times in the California 500 in a variety of equipment, 
but he never came close to winning again. In 1977, he and his son, James, made 
racing history when they became the first father-son entry in an Indy-car race. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought a car from Fred Carillo for James to run and he qualified 18th and 
was running pretty good until his engine gave out," McElreath said. "It was 
pretty exciting. He and I had run together the first time in a dirt car race at 
DuQuoin in 1975, but Ontario was the first big one we ran together." 
</P>
<P>
James was killed a month later in a sprint car race at Winchester, Ind.

BICHETTE HOMER, DOUBLE LEAD ANGELS, 12-6; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: LANGSTON LEAVES GAME IN FOURTH INNING WITH INJURY TEAM COMES BACK IN 
11TH. 
</P>

<P>
They had lost their starting pitcher and their starting shortstop to injuries, 
and by the end of the fourth inning Thursday, the Angels had lost a most of a 
five-run lead, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like two different games, almost," said Angel left fielder Dante 
Bichette. "It was one of those weird ones." 
</P>
<P>
Blame it on the full moon, which watched over an eerily silent Yankee Stadium 
as the Angels scored six times in the 11th inning to wrest a 12-6 victory from 
the Yankees and take two games in their three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps only a full moon can explain the umpires' reversal of a home-run call 
in the first inning on a drive hit down the right-field line by Yankee left 
fielder Jim Leyritz. Angel starter Mark Langston and Manager Doug Rader 
immediately contested the call, and the three-man umpiring crew -- a man short 
while Dale Ford tended to "personal business" -- conferred and produced that 
rarity of rarities, taking away what would have been a two-run home run that 
would have cut in half a 4-0 Angel lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The net sticks out two, three feet and if it was close, it should have hit the 
net," said Langston, who left in the fourth inning after straining his right 
lower back, an injury that isn't considered serious but will be re-evaluated in 
Baltimore today. "The first-base umpire (Jim Evans) said it was fair and then 
said he'd get help from the home-plate umpire, but he said he was watching the 
runner (Steve Sax). The second base umpire (Tim Welke) made the call. I felt it 
was the proper call." 
</P>
<P>
"I signaled fair," Evans said. "It looked fair, but I was bothered by the glare 
of the lights . . . Welke convinced me. He had a better shot. It was very clear 
to Tim that it was foul." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't as clear to the Yankees. "In 25 years of baseball, that's the only 
time I've seen the second-base umpire make a fair or foul call," said Yankee 
Manager Stump Merrill, who was ejected for protesting and was joined in exile 
by first-base coach Mike Ferraro and Leyritz. "That's the only thing I'm going 
to say. My hands are tied." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Angels took a 5-0 lead against Chuck Cary, who gave up hits to 
seven of the 11 men he faced and walked another, the Yankees came back with 
four in the fourth inning against Langston and tied the game in the fifth on an 
unearned run that resulted from an error by Jack Howell, who was thrown in at 
shortstop for the first time since his freshman year of college after Kent 
Anderson felt tightness in his hamstring in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Balboni's homer to left off Greg Minton in the seventh gave the Yankees a 
6-5 lead, but Bichette matched that with a homer to left with one out in the 
ninth inning. Bichette drove in the tiebreaking run in the 11th off Lee 
Guetterman (9-5) with a double, which followed singles by Dave Winfield and 
Brian Downing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a matter of my getting a chance to play. When I play, I'm going to 
produce," said Bichette, who has 18 hits in his last 49 at-bats to bring his 
average to .263 from .230 on July 29. "I have shortened my stride a little bit 
and that's helped. . . . I just want an everyday job somewhere next season." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' middle and late relievers did a solid job, with Bob McClure (1-0) 
getting his first victory since last Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll probably be able to tell better how it is (this morning) when I get 
up," Langston said. "I felt bad that we scored a lot of runs and I let that 
team come back. 
</P>
<P>
I felt bad we had to play as long as we did, but as long as we won, that's the 
positive side." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis was again unable to play because of a stiff back. According to 
trainer Ned Bergert, injured players have lost a total of 796 man-games this 
season. . . . Bryan Harvey had allowed two earned runs in 19 2/3 innings 
through Wednesday and not three runs, as was reported.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: BARS WANT TO TAKE IT, SO NETWORKS COULD DISH IT OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By LARRY STEWART

<TEXT>
<P>
The NFL, scrambling for a solution to its television-signal scrambling problem, 
is beginning to see a clearer picture. 
</P>
<P>
The sports-bar business isn't the enemy -- it's an ally. 
</P>
<P>
Most sports-bar owners say they would gladly pay a rights fee to be able to 
show NFL games legally via their satellite dishes. But they've never been given 
the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
That may change. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, the obvious solution would be to sell subscriptions to bars much the way 
HBO sells subscriptions to viewers at home," said Greg Aiello, the NFL's 
director of communications. 
</P>
<P>
"Although that has not been part of the thinking in the past, it's an option we 
are looking at now. But it's a rather complicated issue." 
</P>
<P>
John Morris doesn't see it as complicated. 
</P>
<P>
He has a plan, just as he did when he and former Ram Dennis Harrah opened 
Legends, a bar in Long Beach, in 1979. Morris' plan then was to install a 
satellite dish on top of his new bar-restaurant so he'd be able to show sports 
events people couldn't get at home. 
</P>
<P>
His plan now, he says, would allow the NFL to make millions off the sports-bar 
business without much effort. 
</P>
<P>
He recently sent letters to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, other league 
officials, the heads of CBS Sports and NBC Sports and advertising executives of 
Anheuser-Busch, Inc., and the Miller Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what Morris has in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Set up a telephone number for bar owners interested in subscribing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establish a fee, say $3 a person, based on the fire-code capacity of each 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Allow each bar owner to decide how he recoups the fee, either by a cover 
charge or simply by food and drink sales. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, most important, have the bar owners police each other. 
</P>
<P>
"When you subscribe, you'd get a list of other bars in your area signed up," 
Morris said. "If you've paid and your competitor down the street hasn't but is 
still showing games, you would simply call the 800 number to report it. 
</P>
<P>
"The league would then take appropriate action -- probably a warning at first." 
</P>
<P>
Morris says this system could be implemented almost immediately because it 
doesn't require the expensive and complicated process of scrambling and 
de-scrambling TV signals. 
</P>
<P>
And, Morris points out, when scrambling does go into effect, subscribers would 
already be in place. All they would need would be a decoder. 
</P>
<P>
There would be problems, such as appeasing network affiliates, but Morris 
believes the money that could be generated would more than compensate. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say you've got 50,000 bars and other establishments across the country 
paying an average of $500 a week," he said as he scribbled some figures. 
"That's $25 million a week, and about $500 million for the entire season, 
counting playoffs and the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Those kinds of numbers might get the NFL's attention. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that the NFL, as well as CBS and NBC, underestimated the furor that 
scrambling would cause. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the league's posture was to take on the sports-bar business head-on. 
"Let them squawk," the NFL said. 
</P>
<P>
But then Anheuser-Busch and Miller aligned themselves with the sports bars and 
their patrons and for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take them long to realize what scrambling would do to sales. Morris 
said Legends sells about 100 cases of Budweiser on an NFL Sunday. Without pro 
football, it's about 30 cases. 
</P>
<P>
So, once the beer-makers, who pour millions of dollars into NFL commercials, 
started doing the squawking, the NFL and the networks started listening. 
</P>
<P>
And they postponed scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
Scrambling is still coming. But apparently it has been learned that, first, 
there needs to be a system for de-scrambling signals that go to sports bars and 
homes equipped with satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the NFL's reasons for wanting to scramble is its tentative pay-per-view 
plans after the 1993 season, when the current TV contract expires. 
</P>
<P>
According to the NFL's Aiello and network officials, the thinking is to 
continue showing games on the networks, but also make a smorgasbord of other 
games available for something like $10 a game. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the viewer would have the choice of watching any game -- some for a price 
-- either at home or at a sports bar. 
</P>
<P>
For years, boxing fans have had that choice for pay-per-view fights, and the 
plan has worked. 
</P>
<P>
It also should work for pro football. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL season opens Sunday with Los Angeles limited to two network games, 
because the Raiders, at last check, are playing at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m., it's the Rams against the Packers at Green Bay on CBS, with Verne 
Lundquist and John Madden reporting. Pat Summerall is at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
At 1 p.m., the NBC game is the Pittsburgh Steelers at the Cleveland Browns, 
with Don Criqui and Bob Trumpy. 
</P>
<P>
For those with cable, TNT will televise its first regular-season NFL game, the 
Philadelphia Eagles vs. the New York Giants, at 5 p.m., with Skip Caray and Pat 
Haden. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's college football schedule begins Saturday with Oklahoma vs. UCLA at the 
Rose Bowl at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Jackson, who will work the game with Bob Griese, is back for his 25th 
season at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had my ups and downs, but it's been a great run," said Jackson, 61, who 
has whittled his work schedule to 26 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I've now got the greatest job in the world. I get the spring and summer off to 
recharge my batteries, then I get to do something I love, college sports." 
</P>
<P>
About Saturday's game, Jackson said: "If Oklahoma can't throw, UCLA should win 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
About quarterback Bret Johnson, who left UCLA after losing the starting job, 
Jackson said: "I think his leaving is a positive thing for UCLA. I don't know 
what's going on in his head, but it appears he doesn't want to compete, and 
you're usually better off without those kinds of people." 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
After the UCLA-Oklahoma game on Channel 7, there will be a nicely done one-hour 
NFL preseason special, produced by GGP Sports, with Dan Dierdorf as host. It 
repeats Sunday at 4 p.m. . . . The UCLA-Oklahoma game will be repeated on Prime 
Ticket Saturday at 6 p.m. . . . On Sept. 15, the Bruins' home game against 
Stanford at 3:30 p.m. will be nationally televised over the Prime Network, 
which includes Prime Ticket. On Sept. 22, USC at Washington will be the Prime 
Network's Pacific 10 game of the week. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive week, CBS is ignoring the baseball races to cover 
the U.S. Open. There's nothing wrong with tennis, but does CBS really think 
it's more popular than baseball? . . . Attention, history buffs: "This Week in 
the NFL," on Channel 2 Saturday at 4:30 p.m., there will be a segment on great 
opening-day performances. Highlighted is Norm Van Brocklin completing 27 of 41 
passes for 554 yards and five touchdowns in a 54-14 Ram victory over the old 
New York Yankees on Sept. 28, 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday won't be an NFL day without Brent Musburger, after all. He'll be ESPN's 
guest on "SportsCenter" at 8:30 a.m. and later at 8 p.m. and on "GameDay" at 9 
a.m. . . . "GameDay" has moved from 8:30 to 9 a.m., but CNN has a new pregame 
show at 8:30 a.m., with Vince Cellini and Ken Stabler. . . . Geoff Witcher has 
replaced John Rebenstorf as Cal State Fullerton's football play-by-play 
announcer. Rebenstorf, now the UCLA radio football commentator, will return to 
Fullerton for basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish-language baseball broadcasts are commonplace, and now there is a 
Korean-language broadcast. Sunday's Dodger-Cincinnati game will be broadcast 
over Radio Korea USA and can be heard in Los Angeles on KAZN (1300). Moon Il 
Lim will handle the play-by-play, and also taking part will be Jong Hwan Park, 
assistant to the commissioner of baseball in Korea.

TIE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR COLORADO THIS TIME; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BIENIEMY SCORES WITH 12 SECONDS TO PLAY AS BUFFALOES RALLY 
FOR A 21-17 VICTORY OVER STANFORD.

<TEXT>
<P>
After one unsatisfying tie, Colorado wasn't about to settle for another. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth-ranked Buffaloes went for -- and got -- a clinching touchdown instead 
of a tying field goal in the closing seconds Thursday night against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Eric Bieniemy dived 1 yard for the winning score with 12 seconds 
remaining as Colorado eked out a 21-17 victory over upset-minded Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, we were going to go for it," said Colorado Coach Bill McCartney, 
whose team endured a 31-31 tie with Tennessee 11 days earlier in Anaheim. "If 
it were fourth-and-eight, we still would have gone for it." 
</P>
<P>
Bieniemy's score -- his third of the game -- came on fourth down and capped an 
80-yard, 15-play drive after Stanford's John Hopkins had given his team a 17-14 
lead on a 27-yard field goal with 4:17 to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal shocked Colorado early, using a long punt return and a turnover to 
forge a 14-0 lead in the first quarter. But Bieniemy, who rushed for 149 yards 
after being suspended for the opener, produced a 14-14 tie with third-quarter 
scoring runs of 18 and 36 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Facing fourth-and-one from the two on its final drive, Colorado passed up a 
field goal and quarterback Darian Hagan sneaked for the first down to the one. 
But two subsequent plunges by George Hemingway produced nothing, and a 
third-down pass fell incomplete. On fourth down, Bieniemy, who finished with 
149 yards rushing, went airborne off the left side for his third touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Coach Dennis Green said he wasn't convinced Bieniemy scored on the 
fourth-down leap. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, if we were at home, they don't get that call," he said.

BASEBALL: GIANTS WIN, 6-2, BUT PRETTY MUCH CONCEDE DIVISION TITLE. DUNCAN 
EJECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Rosen, president of the San Francisco Giants, walked into the clubhouse 
office of Cincinnati Red Manager Lou Piniella Thursday morning, extended his 
hand and said: 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations. You've done a great job. Good luck -- all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Although it sounded like a concession speech, Rosen's team went out and delayed 
what seems to be the inevitable by defeating the Reds, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
With 26 games to play, including the next three in Los Angeles, the Reds lead 
the Dodgers by 6 1/2 games and the Giants by 8 1/2 in the National League West, 
but it seems clear that only the taste of champagne will settle their nerves. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Piniella's gum-spitting, finger-pointing ejection during 
Cincinnati's 5-3 victory Wednesday night, second baseman Mariano Duncan was 
ejected Thursday and responded with a helmet-throwing episode in which he may 
have broken the distance record Piniella established on Aug. 21 when he 
dislodged first base and threw it twice. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers might want to re-stake the palm trees in Chavez Ravine. Nothing is 
safe when the jittery Reds are around, though in this division, the lead they 
built during the season's first eight weeks may be. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds were 33-12 on June 3 but 45-46 since then. 
</P>
<P>
They seem to think that the umpiring crew in the two games at Candlestick Park, 
where Cincinnati is 1-12 over the last two years, has a vendetta against them, 
but the Reds may be seeing shadows where there aren't any. 
</P>
<P>
As San Francisco pitcher Scott Garrelts noted after gaining Thursday's victory: 
"Our approach is to keep playing hard, but we felt we had to win both of these 
games. The Reds have to take an awful skid to let the Giants or Dodgers back in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Said teammate Brett Butler: "It's the Reds' division to lose. Has been all 
summer. If they seem tight right now, I still have to salute them for keeping 
it together so long." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds are attempting to become the first National League team since the 
inception of the 162-game schedule in 1962, and only the fourth team ever, to 
go wire-to-wire. This has increased the pressure on a young team, Piniella 
said, but he added: "Every time we've been knocked down, we bounce back, and 
I'm sure that will be the case in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds will face Jim Neidlinger, Fernando Valenzuela and Ramon Martinez in 
the three-game series that will have a different umpiring crew than Dutch 
Rennert, Terry Tata, Greg Bonin and Jim Quick. This is the crew that has handed 
Piniella three of his five ejections and was present in Cincinnati to measure 
his base throws. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had trouble with this crew all year, but I don't want to talk about it," 
Piniella said after Thursday's loss. "We had opportunities but didn't hit with 
men in scoring position. We lost this game before the ninth inning (when Duncan 
was ejected)." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella's team had 23 hits in the two games, including nine Thursday, but 
Steve Bedrosian struck out the final four Reds on third strikes called by 
Rennert. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait until the season is over so I don't have to deal with these guys 
anymore," Duncan said of NL umpiring in general. "All year, I don't believe the 
calls, and I don't know why (they're against us). We can't control that." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds are considered something of a problem child by NL umpires. Veteran 
Bruce Froemming recently spoke out about it. Rennert denied Thursday that his 
crew has it in for them, saying that the calls can't be all that bad against 
them since they continue to lead the division. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Reds think they have a problem with us," Rennert said of his crew, 
"that's their opinion but not ours. Any time you have umpires and players, 
you're going to have rhubarbs. It can come down to being in the wrong place at 
the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan, who had flipped his bat when called out on strikes in the second 
inning, placed bat and helmet at Rennert's feet when called out in the ninth, 
walked to the dugout, flung his protective shin guard onto the field and was 
ejected by Bonin at first base. He then rifled three helmets from the dugout 
and was restrained from making a charge at Rennert by teammate Ron Oester. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to argue," said Duncan, who is batting .314 and has been ejected 
three times, "but sometimes you lose your mind. I had no idea where the 
(umpire's) strike zone was, and I wasn't the only guy complaining." 
</P>
<P>
The whines eventually should be replaced by wine. Thursday's loss, in which the 
Giants scored three runs off Rick Mahler with two outs in the first inning -- 
two runs coming on a double by Matt Williams, who has 105 runs batted in -- 
should soon be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
For the team that had four consecutive second-place finishes under Pete Rose 
before the fifth-place circus of last year, the learning and healing process 
continues. Tom Browning and Danny Jackson will make their third starts since 
leaving the disabled list this weekend. Jack Armstrong is eligible to come off 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The awful skid Garrelts talked about is unlikely. Once whole and healthy, the 
Reds' blood pressure may soon stop rising with each called strike.

NEWSWIRE: CAVALIERS MATCH OFFER BY HEAT FOR WILLIAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cleveland Cavaliers have matched the Miami Heat's $26.5-million, seven-year 
offer for forward John Williams, the Cavaliers announced Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
By matching the offer, the Cavaliers' payroll will soar through the NBA's 
$11.87-million salary cap, limiting the ability to rework contracts of veterans 
or to sign free agents. 
</P>
<P>
The salary cap can be surpassed in this instance because Cleveland had no 
control over the offer Miami made to Williams.

Saying, "The networks gave me what I wanted," Norman Lebovitz, the San Diego 
restaurateur who launched a boycott of two major beer companies as a way of 
opposing the scrambling of NFL telecasts, announced Thursday that the boycott 
is over. 
</P>
<P>
"The networks assured me and my attorney in private meetings (Wednesday) that 
there will be no scrambling this season," Lebovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz, said he made his decision after talking with brewery executives 
Thursday. He had organized his grass-roots consumer movement, the Assn. for 
Sports Fans' Rights, after the NFL announced on Aug. 17 that most of its games 
would be available only to network affiliates, not to owners of satellite 
dishes. MICHAEL GRANBERRY

SUDDENLY, RAMS COUNT ON NEWMAN; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: WITH SECONDARY DEPLETED BY INJURIES, SAFETY TAKES LEADERSHIP 
ROLE. HE COULD END UP AT CORNERBACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two days before their season opener against a team renown for unmasking 
defensive flaws, the Rams find themselves grappling for solutions to glaring 
problems -- if not simply grasping at defensive straws. 
</P>
<P>
And into this fine mess steps Anthony Newman, a safety by trade but potentially 
a cornerback by necessity Sunday against the Packers in Green Bay, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
With cornerbacks Jerry Gray and Darryl Henley on injured reserve and Alfred 
Jackson questionable, the Rams are turning to Newman to provide the pass 
defense's glue. Makeshift defenses get makeshift leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Other Ram questions have been reasonably resolved by the signings of linebacker 
Kevin Greene and defensive end Doug Reed, and the gradual healing of the top 
crop of receivers. 
</P>
<P>
But the secondary remains a day-to-day contortion. 
</P>
<P>
If cornerback Mickey Sutton, a former Ram -- and Packer -- recently returned 
from the waiver wire, can handle a major assignment Sunday, Newman will stay at 
safety and be asked to exude leadership or as much as a player with one NFL 
start in his previous two seasons can realistically muster. 
</P>
<P>
But if Sutton cannot deliver, or if another cornerback is injured, Newman -- 
after going a full training camp as the starting strong safety, partly because 
of the long holdout of last year's starter, Michael Stewart -- will be shifted 
to cornerback. At either position, he will be facing a Packer offense that 
boasts Pro Bowl receiver Sterling Sharpe, who caught eight passes for 164 yards 
against a sound Ram secondary last year. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of questions, and Newman seems to be the Rams' answer for most 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
These are strange times for the Ram defense and Anthony Newman, and nobody is 
denying it. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens, first of all, (is) you take a Jerry Gray out of your secondary, 
who's not only a great player but a great leader," defensive coordinator Fritz 
Shurmur said. "He kind of runs things back there. He's the guy who has the 
ability to hold it all together. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you take him out, and even though (starting right cornerback) Bobby 
Humphery is a veteran player, he's a new player for us. Anthony Newman has been 
an in-and-out-starter kind of a guy, and all of a sudden he and (strong safety) 
Vince Newsome become the constants back there, the guys who have had the most 
experience playing as starters. 
</P>
<P>
"So, Anthony assumes a new leadership role. He's done a good job, too, of 
showing a lot of authority and that thing you need back there, kind of a 
stability factor. You can't have a bunch of guys back there flying around who 
are loose cannons. They've got to have some steadiness to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially against that offense." 
</P>
<P>
That, in defensive coordinator's shorthand, means the Packers' dangerous 
"pass-to-daylight" scheme, an offense that piled up 442 yards and nearly wiped 
out a 31-7 halftime deficit against the Rams last season before the Rams won, 
41-38. 
</P>
<P>
Even with last year's starting quarterback, Don Majkowski, limited to a relief 
role because he recently agreed to a one-year, $1.5-million contract, it can be 
assumed that the Green Bay offense is best handled by players who actually have 
started more than a few NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
Second-year man Anthony Dilweg will start at quarterback for the Packers, but 
Majkowski almost certainly will be dressed and eager to play should Dilweg 
falter. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing them will be Newman, a player the Rams have always liked but had never 
quite found the inclination to play regularly. 
</P>
<P>
They have found it now. Boy, have they found it. 
</P>
<P>
Inexperience and injury have kept him on the sidelines for most of the last two 
years. Last season, he broke his left elbow in December and missed the rest of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said he is fully prepared. "We lost the great one, Jerry Gray," he said. 
"And Alfred's questionable. But still, we've got guys here who can step right 
in and play. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody needs experience; everybody's got to start somewhere. Jerry started 
somewhere. You start one time, and you just take it from there. And if you're a 
great athlete, who cares if it's your first game and your first year . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to play ball. You're going to let your athletic ability take 
over. So we're not worried. We're a group. We're a defense. We're going to help 
each other, and we're going to take care of business." 
</P>
<P>
If all breaks well for the Rams this weekend, Sutton and Humphery will start on 
the corners, with Newsome and Newman the old hands at safety. 
</P>
<P>
Latin Berry, a rookie who was a fullback in college, and Jackson will share the 
"nickel" corner duties, and Stewart will be the extra safety. 
</P>
<P>
Will Green Bay try to take a few deep whacks at this patched-up bunch? 
</P>
<P>
"The Packers are a team that throws the ball anyway," Newman said. "They're not 
a running team; they don't have the great back there. They've got some great 
receivers -- Sterling Sharpe (for one). 
</P>
<P>
"So they're going to throw the ball. They're coming out throwing. We know that, 
everybody else knows that." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Rams will activate linebacker Kevin Greene, defensive end Doug Reed 
and safety Michael Stewart and will place tight end Jim Price and receiver Tony 
Lomack, who have hamstring injuries, on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Injury update: Ram starting right tackle Jackie Slater (toe injury) is 
doubtful; cornerback Alfred Jackson (groin injury) is questionable; and wide 
receivers Henry Ellard, Aaron Cox and Flipper Anderson (hamstring injuries), 
tackle Robert Cox (rib injury) and guard Joe Milinichik (thumb injury) are all 
listed as probable. . . . Because of injuries at tackle, starting right guard 
Duval Love spent part of Thursday's practice at tackle and rookie center Bern 
Brostek worked some of the time at guard. . . . For the Packers, defensive end 
Shawn Patterson (hamstring injury) is doubtful; starting safety Chuck Cecil 
(hamstring injury) is questionable and starting fullback Brent Fullwood (knee 
injury) is probable.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rookie Garry Lewis will replace Terry McDaniel at cornerback in the Raiders' 
season opener against the Denver Broncos Sunday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel has been sidelined by a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a seventh-round draft choice from Alcorn State, is the second rookie to 
start in the Raider defensive backfield since Jack Tatum in 1971. McDaniel 
started as a rookie in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Howie Long, who moved to the right side of the Raider line during 
the exhibition season, has apparently returned to the left side, with Scott 
Davis going to the right side. CHRIS BAKER

MEETING RBV WILL TEST MORSE'S METTLE, MEMORY 
</P>

<P>
John Shacklett knows that 18 players on his team have last year's 3-A San Diego 
Section semifinal loss to Rancho Buena Vista etched into their memories. 
</P>
<P>
A 56-36 score does not fade quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids want to go after them real bad simply because (RBV's) a good, 
competitive team," said Shacklett, entering his 20th season Morse's coach. 
"Sure, they remember last year, and I'd be foolish to say they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
And if anyone else remembers -- and is aware of how good these teams are this 
year -- they might be foolish to skip tonight's game at 7:30 at Mesa College. 
Rancho Buena Vista is ranked No. 1 in the county, Morse No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Although Morse scored a 55-13 victory two weeks ago against Punahoe, Hawaii, 
this weekend officially kicks off the San Diego high school season. There's no 
better way to begin a year than by watching two teams that were 11-3 last 
season charge headlong into each other. 
</P>
<P>
They met under the same circumstances at the beginning of last season, and RBV 
won, 35-20. After it was discovered RBV used an ineligible player -- a freshman 
-- it became one of two Longhorn forfeits. And then there was the semifinal 
game, which RBV won by 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see Rancho and Morse play every year," Shacklett said. "I think 
it's good for high school football, and it could develop into a healthy 
rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
The components are there for this to become one of the county's great ones: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A city team vs. a North County team. There's little doubt the City Eastern 
and Palomar are the two best leagues in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two coaches, Shacklett and Craig Bell, who have enormous respect for each 
other and from their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winning programs. RBV is entering its fourth year and has won back-to-back 
section titles, the 2-A in 1988, the 3-A in 1989. Morse has been to the 3-A 
finals the past three years and is vying for its second title in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Talent. Morse has quarterback Teddy Lawrence, who passed and rushed for 
nearly 3,000 yards last year and had a hand in 19 touchdowns; his skill and 3.5 
grade-point average make him one of the nation's top 100 recruits. RBV has 
Markeith Ross. Only four players in section history have gained more than 2,000 
yards rushing, and Ross was one of two in the same backfield last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be very surprised if these two teams aren't in the stadium this year 
(playing for the championship)," Shacklett said.

LYNN'S AIM: CONFUSE 'EM, AGGRESSIVELY

If there was such a thing as a college course in Strategies and Tactics of an 
NFL Defensive System, no doubt some idiot would take it, thinking, "Now here's 
an easy A." 
</P>
<P>
Finding he was sadly mistaken a few hours into the course, the student would 
change his thinking drastically. "Why didn't I take Parapsychology or Aerospace 
Engineering?" 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, here is what the course outline might look like. It will 
concentrate on just one of the 28 NFL defenses -- the Chargers' -- and in this 
lesson, emphasis will be on the front seven -- the linemen and linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Lynn, the defensive coordinator, could be the instructor. His 
qualifications: gentle, easy-going approach; ability to relate subject matter 
in a positive manner; has built a defense -- once the laughingstock of the NFL 
-- into one of the best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
A national publication recently called Lynn "the best assistant coach who's 
never been a head coach in the NFL but will be." 
</P>
<P>
To which Lynn replied: "That's flattering. It's nice to hear those things. It's 
also embarrassing. But it's better than reading you're a dork." 
</P>
<P>
In the Chargers' system, everything begins with the front seven, and the first 
thing to know about it is the basic alignment. The Chargers run what they call 
a "Base 3-4" -- meaning three down linemen and four linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing to understand about the Base 3-4 is that the Chargers almost 
never deploy it. Rather, it serves as a focal point, the square one from which 
all other defensive fronts are built. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a number of factors, alignments, schemes and plays are developed 
around the Base 3-4 set. Those factors include down and distance, score, time, 
injuries and the opponent, its blocking schemes and pass routes and the 
quarterback's ability and arm strength. 
</P>
<P>
"Our basic approach," Lynn said, "is to give (the other team) as many different 
looks as we can and hope to cause an offensive team to reduce its inventory of 
plays so that they can't have their whole arsenal at their disposal. As soon as 
we can ascertain what they've eliminated and what they're trying to emphasize, 
we hope we can go to whatever we feel has the best opportunity against that." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds simple enough. Confuse the heck out of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially," Lynn added, "we want to be an up-the-field team . . . attack, 
create, make some things happen. Let's not sit on the line of scrimmage and 
wait. Let's, as best we can, initiate what happens. We're not averse to dogging 
or blitzing on any down. We want their offensive blockers to think that at any 
time, any one of our people can be pass-rushers. And I think they (the 
defenders) like the fact that it's a go-get-'em type thing. It's not a matter 
of sitting and reading and letting this 320-pounder come off and do frontal 
lobotomies on you all day." 
</P>
<P>
Confuse the heck out of them, but do it aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, Lynn wants quick, aggressive, intelligent athletes. Much like the 
ones he has. 
</P>
<P>
In the Chargers' Base 3-4, Joe Phillips is the nose tackle, Lee Williams and 
Burt Grossman the defensive ends, Billy Ray Smith and Leslie O'Neal the outside 
linebackers and Gary Plummer and Cedric Figaro the inside linebackers. Les 
Miller subs at nose tackle, George Hinkle at defensive end, Henry Rolling at 
outside linebacker, and Junior Seau and Richard Brown at inside linebacker. 
Five of those -- Grossman, O'Neal, Seau, Smith and Williams -- were No. 1 draft 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the arrangement is that rarely, if ever, will all of the Base 3-4 
"starters" be playing at their listed position at the same time. Everything 
changes from game to game, quarter to quarter, series to series and down to 
down. Along the line, forward or back, up or down . . . hardly ever will the 
front seven line up the same way two plays in a row. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal will probably spend as much or more time as a down lineman than as a 
linebacker. Smith, who normally covers the tight end, will also rush 
frequently. Grossman and Williams will be used in some zone coverages while a 
safety or two blitz. Plummer and Figaro will blitz and stunt regularly from a 
number of different spots. 
</P>
<P>
In other situations, anywhere from zero to three players could be replaced by 
defensive backs. And any one of those replaced could be any one of the front 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is get the best possible matchups, one-on-one, that we 
can get," Lynn said. "If our feeling is that Leslie (O'Neal) is more suited to 
play over this guy than Burt (Grossman), than we might just change the 
alignments for that week. Their athletic abilities allow us to do that. Their 
intellect allows us to do that." 
</P>
<P>
So the possibilities then are endless? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way," said Gunther Cunningham, the Chargers' defensive line 
coach. "If you wrote down a script of 50 plays a team might run in a given 
game, I guarantee you, we could and probably would line up 50 different 
defenses. Easy."

PREVIEW: NEWCOMERS ENCOUNTER AMERICA IN 'DOCU-PLAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing is as familiar in the story of America as immigration, yet a play 
debuting tonight is built on the idea that the lives of today's immigrants are 
mysteries to most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"Journeys: The Immigrants' Tale," not only a new play, but the first to be 
presented at the Lankershim Cultural Arts Center, tells the stories of five 
contemporary newcomers to this country. The play was written by Kimberly 
Heinrichs, a journalist and North Hollywood resident who gathered her material 
from conversations with five immigrants in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not the sort of people you're going to read about in the news," she 
said. "They're like a majority of the immigrants out there. You might pass them 
on the street and not know that half their family is back in Vietnam. You 
wouldn't guess the problems they're struggling with." 
</P>
<P>
These include racial and religious discrimination, economic hardship, 
exploitation, culture shock and separation from loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than being a catalogue of troubles, the play looks at how the dreams 
and expectations of immigrants stand up to reality. Director Sally Shore said 
one scene strikes her as especially poignant. 
</P>
<P>
A Vietnamese teen-ager has been looking forward to her life in America because 
the scope of education here is much broader than in her homeland. She is 
correct in that her school offers a vast range of subjects. But the family is 
so poor, she must work and has little time for study. 
</P>
<P>
"I have so many choices," Shore quotes the girl as saying. "I could be so many 
things. But sometimes I wake up and feel I'm still in Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
The play has two acts, the first largely about coming to the U.S. and the 
second about adjusting to life here. The immigrants are from Vietnam, Korea, 
East Germany, Russia and Honduras. The stories are distinct, but characters 
move from one to another. 
</P>
<P>
"The stories have a lot of commonality," said Shore. "They're more about the 
Everyman than about dramatic occurrences in any one person's life." 
</P>
<P>
A nine-member cast from Shore's company, Theatre to Go!, is presenting the 
play. All are professional actors, she said. The director added that she has a 
background in dance, giving the production a "very choreographic style." 
</P>
<P>
Heinrichs said the stories are nearly literal accounts of the people she 
interviewed. "Almost everything in there happened to them," she said. "I didn't 
add much. You might call it a docu-play." 
</P>
<P>
Her interest in immigrants began with stories she wrote while working as a 
reporter for a small paper in Ontario, Calif. But it wasn't until later, when 
she was considering subjects for a play, that the concept of "Journeys" 
presented itself. 
</P>
<P>
Heinrichs found her subjects through friends and contacts with foreign-language 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an immigrant isn't something I'd thought about in any great depth 
before," she said. "I never thought about what it would be like to grow up with 
your mother living in another country and just writing you letters." 
</P>
<P>
 "Journeys: The Immigrants' Tale"; 8 p.m. tonight, Saturday and Sunday, with a 
2 p.m. matinee Sunday; Lankershim Cultural Arts Center, 5108 Lankershim Blvd., 
North Hollywood. Continues through Sept. 23. Tickets, $10. Call (213) 559-6894.

JUST KIDDING: "I don't care. I'm a good sport," says attorney Stephen G. Corris 
of Irvine, portrayed in a front-page Wall Street Journal article as the "butt 
of a thousand faxes." 
</P>
<P>
.. . Corris' 1988 letter to Wyoming lawyer Becky Klemt, in which he rejected a 
minor case because it was beneath his $1,000-an-hour fee, has been 
internationally circulated along the legal grapevine -- along with Klemt's 
biting letter in response: "We've all been practicing trying to say we charge 
$1,000 an hour with a straight face, but so far, we haven't been able to do 
it." . . . But it's all a misunderstanding, Corris says. He says he no longer 
practices and thought Klemt's original letter was a gag from a friend in 
Wyoming. Corris says his response was a joke intended to sound as pompous as 
possible. . . . Regardless, the incident has brought fame, cases and job offers 
for Klemt and for Corris a reputation of being, in his words, "a swithering, 
blithering idiot." Mark I. Pinsky and Tom Hamilton

POLICE PUZZLE OVER MOTIVE IN 4 O.C. SLAYINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
The murder of a pregnant Vietnamese woman, her two young children and a 
30-year-old friend on Wednesday has mystified neighbors, horrified the local 
Vietnamese community and so far puzzled police, who say they lack both a motive 
and a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough information that will send us in any one direction," 
Costa Mesa Police Capt. Thomas Lazar said Thursday, adding that the killings do 
not appear to be the work of gangs or robbers. "We have not ruled out murder or 
murder-suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Hanh Thi Duong, 25; her son, Thang Quoc Nguyen, 7, and her daughter, Lan Ngoc 
Nguyen, 4, were found Wednesday evening on the floor of their two-bedroom Baker 
Street apartment, dead of gunshot wounds, authorities said. The fourth victim, 
also Vietnamese, was identified late Thursday as Oanh Van Le, 30, of 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Police responded to a call Wednesday evening from a man, thought to be a friend 
of the family, who had arrived to help the family move. Getting no answer to 
his shouts, the man peered in a broken window and saw only the woman's legs as 
she lay on the floor of the apartment, located in an ethnically diverse section 
of town. 
</P>
<P>
Police were on the scene at 7:34 p.m. and entered the apartment briefly, 
determining that the victims were dead. After cordoning off the area for hours 
Wednesday night while waiting for a search warrant to investigate the crime 
scene, police re-entered shortly before dawn Thursday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, police found no evidence of a struggle. Nothing had apparently been 
taken, and the apartment, though mostly bare of furniture, was not in disarray. 
Without any sign of forced entry, police believe that Duong or Le may have 
known the assailant -- if the deaths were not the result of a murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing to show that there was a struggle," Lazar said. "Normally, 
you would see ransacking." 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the two children were discovered on the floor of their empty 
bedroom, the beds already removed. The two adults were in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the 30-year-old Le was living with the family, but police said 
he is not the children's father. Costa Mesa Police Lt. Tom Warnack described Le 
as a friend of the other victims. 
</P>
<P>
The children's father, police believe, is either dead or in Vietnam. "We don't 
believe him to be in the area," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
Police would not say how many times the victims were shot, whether the murder 
weapon had been found, how the assailant had entered the apartment or other 
details of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the victims were removed at 11 a.m. Thursday and taken to the 
coroner's office, where autopsies were performed. No results were released 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors were not able to provide many details about the family, saying only 
that the young mother had arrived from Vietnam within the past few years, spoke 
little English and kept mostly to herself. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Tilley, who lives in the same apartment complex, said she had had 
little contact with Duong because of her limited English. Tilley, who said that 
she thought Duong was married, had noticed her neighbor's swelling waistline -- 
Duong was in the first trimester of her pregnancy, police said. Tilley also 
said she was aware that the family was moving. 
</P>
<P>
"She was sitting on the lawn one day with her kids and I walked up and said, 
'Hi,' " Tilley said, adding that she had wished Duong and her family well in 
their new home but did not know where they planned to go. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mother was not well-known by many of her neighbors, 7-year-old 
Thang -- a spirited young boy born in Vietnam whose school photo shows him in a 
Batman shirt -- was settling into Killybrooke Elementary School and making 
friends. After overcoming language problems last year, Thang was quickly 
learning English and doing better in school, according to his teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel so horrible," said Thang's teacher, who asked not to be named. "He 
was such a sweet little boy, very cooperative, a nice little student." 
</P>
<P>
Because all four victims were Vietnamese, early speculation focused on whether 
the crimes were an example of "home-invasion" robberies, in which bandits 
typically break into homes in Asian neighborhoods, tie up, and often beat or 
threaten their victims. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said there had been several such robberies in the area recently, as 
well as other break-ins, street crimes and car thefts. But the fact that 
nothing appeared missing from the apartment and that no struggle appears to 
have occurred squelched the home-invasion theory, police said. 
</P>
<P>
That brought little comfort to those who live in the community, however, as 
many fretted over what they say is a recent escalation in area crime. Those 
crimes, some neighbors said, frightened them out of taking action when they 
heard a commotion -- pounding on walls and running footsteps -- in and around 
the apartment late Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The murders stunned the local Vietnamese community, and local leaders groped 
for a theory that could explain the brutal killings. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people think it's either love or money," said Mai Cong, chairman 
of the Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a social service agency. 
"But one thing that no one has any explanation for is why they killed two 
children. That puzzles everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember any similar case where they shoot the whole family," Cong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nghi Duong, a Costa Mesa resident who is not related to the mother, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"How could such a shocking tragedy happen to a family like that?" Nghi Duong 
asked. "The killer should be sent back to Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers James M. Gomez and Eric Lichtblau contributed to this 
report.

DRIVER FOUND SAFE, CONFUSED 250 MILES AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An 89-year-old Laguna Hills man who disappeared three days ago while driving 
home from an auto repair shop was found Thursday 250 miles from home, hungry 
but unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol Officer Joe David found Ted Adams sitting in his 
stalled 1978 Cadillac El Dorado at 5:30 a.m., pumping the brake pedal, about 40 
miles west of Needles on Interstate 40 near the Arizona border. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought he was still moving," David said. "He had been sitting there three 
or four hours, max. I think he just drove it until it ran out of gas." 
</P>
<P>
David said Adams was scared and shaking when he found him and that it took 
about 15 minutes to calm him down. But once comforted, David said, Adams "was 
ready for the next move." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he had no idea where he was at or where he lived," David said. "And 
he couldn't remember how he got out there. He said he was out looking for his 
wife." 
</P>
<P>
His 87-year-old wife, Alice, was relieved to hear the news but a bit angry. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean going off like that?" she said she told her husband in a 
brief telephone conversation soon after he was found. "I was kind of mad by 
that point," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I was busy," she quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"He's forgetful. He doesn't know what he's doing half the time." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of driving the five hours to retrieve her husband, Alice Adams called a 
nephew in Kingman, Ariz., about 60 miles away. The nephew, Phil Mattson, picked 
up his uncle, had the Cadillac towed, and drove him to Kingman. He planned to 
return his uncle home by the weekend, Alice Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
David said Adams probably hadn't eaten or drunk anything since he was last seen 
Tuesday at about 3:45 p.m. He disappeared as he was following a neighbor home 
from an auto repair shop, where the two men had picked up Adams' car. 
</P>
<P>
After Adams was found, David took him to a Denny's Restaurant, where he juiced 
up on bacon, eggs, white toast and coffee. And lots of water. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Adams said her husband of 14 years has never done anything like this 
before and even dislikes leaving their home in the Leisure World retirement 
community. She said that he has no medical problems and that this incident can 
simply be explained by his age. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everybody gets to be 90, you know," she pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel wonderful that he's OK. Thank goodness. I've just been going crazy. I'm 
so relieved, I'm going to try to get some sleep today." 
</P>
<P>
She said she plans to keep an eye on her husband for a while. But for now, she 
is thinking of canceling a surprise party for his 90th birthday Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the hall and called a caterer and invited the people," she said. "But 
I'm not going to have it now . . . because he's so vague and forgetful. I don't 
think he'd even know the people anymore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Way Home 
</P>

Ted Adams, 89, of Laguna Hills, who disappeared Tuesday while driving home from 
an auto repair shop, was found Thursday morning on Interstate 40 near Needles. 
He was hungry but unharmed.

BUREAU'S JURISDICTION. A VIGIL FOR AMBER IS PLANNED TODAY IN SANTA ANA.

FBI officials announced Thursday that they have reviewed the case of a 
15-year-old Garden Grove cheerleader who was beaten and slashed last month in 
what some activists allege was a racially motivated incident and have decided 
not to pursue an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The news dealt a blow to the victim's family, which had been calling for an 
independent federal inquiry into the case, alleging that the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department had mishandled the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is violations by a police officer acting under color of the law, 
but that was not the case here," FBI spokesman Fred Reagan said. "This appeared 
to be a matter of mutual combat between private parties." 
</P>
<P>
Amber Jefferson, who has a black father and a white mother, was beaten with a 
baseball bat and slashed with a piece of glass outside a Stanton apartment 
complex during a brawl Aug. 6 that involved more than a dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
Amber and her friends allege that they were attacked by a group of white men 
and teen-agers wielding baseball bats because they were black and Latino. Some 
among the white group maintain that the incident was not about race but rather 
escalated into a fight between two girls over a boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is still being reviewed by the Orange County district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said the FBI decided not to pursue the case because it did not fall 
within its jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
"The facts of the matter have been studied in some detail and the determination 
has been made that there was no apparent violation of federal law within FBI 
jurisdiction," he said. That jurisdiction includes the federal civil rights 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Amber's attorney, Carol Sobel, could not be reached for comment on the FBI's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI announcement came as a demonstration was being held by the victim's 
family and supporters aimed at turning up public pressure on Orange County 
authorities. Gathered on the steps of the U.S. District Court building, a 
coalition of civil rights groups and Hollywood celebrities repeated their 
demand that arrests be made in the attack on the 15-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing statements made at a news conference held last week in Yorba Linda, 
organizers criticized the Orange County Sheriff's Department's handling of the 
case. To further press that point, community groups from Los Angeles and Orange 
counties have organized a candlelight vigil for 4 p.m. today near the Sheriffs' 
Department headquarters in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Amber, who attended the news conference on the steps of the court building in 
Los Angeles, suffered a broken jaw and an inch-wide gash running down the side 
of her face. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by reporters what she wanted to see done, she replied "justice." She 
then broke into tears. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said his group may ask the U.S. 
Justice Department to intervene if Orange County prosecutors fail to file 
charges in the case. Ridley-Thomas and other community leaders contend that the 
Sheriff's Department has failed to aggressively pursue the case because of the 
victim's race. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that had the makeup of the victims and the perpetrators been 
different, the Sheriff's Department would have come out with a different 
report," Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the SCLC, other organizations attending the press conference were the 
American Civil Liberties Union, Multiracial Americans of Southern California 
and the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Irene Cara and Joe Morton, who plays a prosecutor in the television 
series "Equal Justice," also turned out to lend their support to Amber and her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department presented the results of their investigation to the 
district attorney's office last week with the recommendation that charges be 
filed against 12 people on both sides. Recommended charges against five of 
Amber's friends range from fighting to assault with a deadly weapon; 
recommended charges against seven people in the other group include fighting, 
assault with a deadly weapon and participating in a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department issued a statement Thursday saying that its 
investigation was "thorough and comprehensive." Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson 
said the department is willing to cooperate with any government agency that may 
ask to review the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Orange County district attorney's office said 
before the FBI announcement that his office is proceeding with its 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"If the feds want to look into it, fine," Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley 
said. "What is ironic is that people are criticizing our alleged lack of 
activity without ever having talked to us."

MORE SPECIAL ED BUILDINGS PLANNED

<TEXT>
<P>
County and Tustin school district officials celebrated the groundbreaking for 
new school buildings for special education students on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The new facilities are additions to existing elementary schools, allowing the 
integration of handicapped students with other students, said Robert Ours, 
administrator for facilities and planning for the Orange County Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
The first such project in the county opened Thursday with 60 special education 
students at Phillip J. Reilly School in Mission Viejo, Ours said. 
</P>
<P>
When two new buildings are completed at Robert P. Heideman School in Tustin in 
about a year, 50 special education students will be integrated with the 470 
students now registered at the school. The estimated cost of the state-funded 
project at Heideman is $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Heideman School was built in 1969 with 15 classrooms. This project will add 12 
classrooms to be used by both special education students and others. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thrilled," said Heideman Principal Patricia James. "The discussion and 
planning have been going on for about three years now." SHANNON SANDS

CITY ETHICS MANUAL TO BE DISTRIBUTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A manual of ethics and values, nearly three years in the making, soon will be 
distributed to all City Hall employees. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joanne Coontz began a campaign in 1987 to update the code of 
ethics as outlined in a 1972 City Council resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"A resolution is not worth the paper it's written on unless you do something 
about it," Coontz said. "A lot of new employees knew nothing" about the ethics 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the council adopted a new manual that summarizes the city's ethical 
policies and provides a statement of values. The pamphlet will be printed 
in-house and distributed to all employees, Coontz said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that the city is growing and people are coming in from all over who 
are not familiar with our city," Coontz said. "I just think people should know 
more about the corporation they work for. It's a good thing to pass out to all 
employees and all new appointments on commissions and committees." 
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet, which emphasizes honesty, integrity and loyalty, includes a 
statement of values and outlines standards of conduct and ethical principals. 
The margins of the manual are filled with quotes from leaders and philosophers 
such as Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, John Morley and others. 
</P>
<P>
The manual's "statement of values," a guide designed to provide continuity for 
the city's leadership, lists the worth of the individual, effective service, 
future planning and individual commitment to public service as high priorities 
for all employees. 
</P>
<P>
The manual is drawn from the 1972 code, a values statement used by the city of 
Fairfield and a report by the League of California Cities Committee. MARY HELEN

Unable to agree among themselves, members of the Planning Commission this week 
sent a controversial proposal to extend La Veta Avenue back to the City Council 
without a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed extension between Cambridge and Tustin streets is shown as a 
four-lane arterial road in the city's General Plan and would provide what has 
been called an essential east-west traffic route. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan would also leave some homes on Fairway Drive on an "island" 
between La Veta Avenue and the Garden Grove Freeway and would require paving 
over part of Santiago Creek, a greenbelt that residents have been fighting for 
10 years to preserve. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is scheduled to hold a public hearing and vote Tuesday on 
whether to amend the General Plan and remove the extension. 
</P>
<P>
None of the planning commissioners supported the road extension as proposed, 
but they disagreed on whether the proposed street should be removed from the 
General Plan before an alternative is approved. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Randy Bosch and Don Scott voted to remove the La Veta extension 
from the plan immediately. Bosch said the city must find long-range solutions 
to its paralyzing traffic problems and should consider slowing development and 
reducing density as well as working with nearby cities to develop alternative 
methods of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Carmine Master and Bill Cathcart voted to retain the La Veta 
extension in the General Plan while such alternatives are considered. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to break a 2-2 tie, the commissioners agreed to send the proposal back 
to the council with no specific recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
La Veta Avenue was scheduled to cross Villa Santiago, a development on the 
former Santiago Golf Course that was recently rejected by the council after 
years of public protest. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Department of Public Works and Traffic have 
recommended La Veta as the best and most cost-effective solution to the city's 
traffic problems. The four-lane arterial would cost about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the City Council requested an independent study of the 
traffic-circulation element of the General Plan and asked the traffic 
department to recommend alternatives to the long-debated La Veta extension. 
</P>
<P>
City Traffic Engineer Bernie Dennis said almost any alternative is sure to be 
more expensive and possibly just as controversial as the La Veta extension and 
warned that if the city approves a development plan for the former golf course 
without addressing the traffic problems, it could face "possible litigation 
from adjacent cities or possible denial of state funds." MARY HELEN BERG

DEBATE DELAYS PLAN FOR SENIOR CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to expand the city's senior citizen center hit a snag this week, as it 
became the latest focus of a City Council political debate. 
</P>
<P>
The council on Tuesday delayed a plan to add a building to the Rodgers Seniors 
Center because of concerns that the expansion would be nixed if voters approve 
a Nov. 6 ballot initiative limiting beach and park development. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the new building is needed to expand recreational and 
outreach services for the city's growing senior citizen population. 
</P>
<P>
The otherwise routine proposal was tossed into the political arena after 
Councilman Don MacAllister questioned whether the ballot measure, if approved, 
would hinder the center's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Measure C, a citywide initiative sponsored by Save Our Parks, a citizens 
activist group, is a proposed City Charter amendment that would forbid the city 
from selling or leasing any park or beach land without voter approval. The 
measure would apply to new developments larger than 3,000 square feet or 
costing at least $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
MacAllister, who opposes the initiative, said he believes the measure would 
force a citywide vote on the senior center expansion, because the proposed 
$150,000 building addition is planned for the city-owned site at Orange Avenue 
and 17th Street. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy debate, council members directed City Atty. Gail C. Hutton to 
issue a legal opinion on the measure's potential effect on the expansion. 
Hutton's report is scheduled to be released at the council's next meeting, 
Sept. 17. JOHN PENNER

COOK WITHDRAWS FROM COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former City Administrator Paul E. Cook said Thursday he is out of the City 
Council race, even though it is too late to remove his name from the Nov. 6 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm out, and if by some fluke I were to win on Nov. 6, I won't serve," Cook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a job I do not want. I got talked into becoming a candidate in the first 
place, and this week I realized that I just do not want to be on the City 
Council." 
</P>
<P>
Until he retired in February, Cook was the city administrator -- the equivalent 
of city manager and thus the top-ranking non-elected official in Huntington 
Beach city government. A strong advocate of redevelopment, Cook is credited by 
the current City Council with getting the gears moving for the building now 
under construction in downtown Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said Thursday that business leaders were among those who urged him to get 
into the City Council race. "With John Erskine not running again, and the lack 
of business-oriented candidates, I was urged to run," he said. "I'm still very 
interested in seeing redevelopment go forward, but I don't want to spend 
$50,000 of other people's money campaigning for a job I really don't want." 
</P>
<P>
Cook said he still plans to speak out for redevelopment projects, "including 
the controversial ones," as a private citizen. He said he believes the 
pro-business community needs to be represented, and added that he will be 
appearing at City Council meetings and other civic sessions to speak on behalf 
of downtown development. 
</P>
<P>
Cook's withdrawal leaves a total of 10 candidates vying for four City Council 
seats in the Nov. 6 election.BILL BILLITER

RESIDENTS NOT HAPPY ABOUT PROJECT PLANS 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of a neighborhood with names such as Happy, Jolly and Joyful aren't 
lately, because of plans for a 140-unit condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 of them went to City Hall this week and persuaded planning 
commissioners to scale down the redevelopment project on Joyful Lane and Happy 
Drive, near Jolly Lane. 
</P>
<P>
The development is a joint project of a Huntington Beach company and the city's 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners, who will reconsider a revised version of the proposal Oct. 2, 
agreed with residents' criticisms that the planned complex would be too large 
and that it targets young buyers for property designated for senior-citizen 
housing. The 4-acre site is one of the last in the city zoned for low-cost, 
senior housing. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners decided not to reject the project entirely, however, mainly 
because it calls for more than half of the condominiums to be set aside for 
moderate-income buyers, who could receive federal assistance for their down 
payment. Those buyers, who must earn less than $50,000 per year, would qualify 
for $2 million in federal subsidies the city has earmarked for the project. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, however, the housing assistance would be available only for 
first-time buyers. Commissioners are calling for revised plans to make 
available at least some of the financial aid for low-income seniors.

VALUE OF BOOTLEG CASSETTE SEIZURE PUT AT $2.6 MILLION

<P>
Police searching for a robbery suspect accidentally discovered a bootleg 
cassette factory in Fullerton containing 100,000 counterfeit Latino, 
country-Western and rap tapes, the largest seizure in Orange County history, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure represented an estimated loss of $2.6 million to the recording 
industry, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The bootleg operation seized Wednesday may be connected to similar raids 
conducted last month in Los Angeles County, police said Thursday. Also 
confiscated were 2,300 original master tapes, labels and other packaging 
materials and recording equipment valued at $50,000. Officials said the dubbing 
machines were capable of producing 12 tapes every 90 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The bootleg operation in Fullerton was discovered by two Los Angeles police 
detectives who went to Unit J of an industrial complex at 2524 Fender Ave. on 
Wednesday to serve a search warrant in an unrelated robbery case. The person 
they were looking for had listed CST Environmental as his work address. 
</P>
<P>
Although CST Environmental had moved away, the bootleg operation hadn't 
replaced the name on the door when it moved in about six weeks ago, Fullerton 
Police Sgt. Glenn Deveney said. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Los Angeles police) saw employees dubbing cassette tapes and recognized 
it as a pirating operation," Deveney said, adding that the Fullerton Police 
Department was then called in to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Based on interviews with five employees who were detained briefly, 
investigators said the counterfeit tapes were being manufactured day and night, 
resulting in the production of about 30,000 cassettes a week. Police said the 
employees were paid $150 a week. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the larger piracy warehouses," Fullerton Police Detective Joe 
Caracci said. "It's one of the more sophisticated ones." 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of the tapes confiscated in Fullerton were by Latino artists, such as 
Alex Bueno and Los Mier. The other cassettes included recordings by M.C. 
Hammer, Milli Vanilli and Willie Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
Such tapes are sold at swap meets at below-market prices, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that the operation was distributing the tapes nationwide. 
Caracci said evidence showed some of the tapes were being shipped to El Paso, 
Tex., with other locations listed on business documents. Some were probably 
distributed in Los Angeles, Caracci said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of Mexican-American and Hispanic people (in the Los Angeles 
area). And like everybody else, they go to swap meets; we go to swap meets, and 
these tapes are made for the region." 
</P>
<P>
A recording industry spokeswoman said a raid in Chino on Aug. 28 resulted in 
the confiscation of tapes and equipment representing a potential annual loss to 
the industry of $45 million. Police searched two more locations in Ontario the 
next day, where an additional 20,000 tapes were confiscated. No dollar value 
was available. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people were charged with violations in those raids, according to Trish 
Heimors, a spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Assn. of America Inc. The 
bootleg recordings confiscated were mostly by rap artists, including 2 Live 
Crew and Stevie B. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants for the association have joined Fullerton police in the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Caracci said all these bootleg operations could be connected, but he declined 
to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the owner of the Fullerton business operated under three or four 
names, but they had narrowed it down to one name by Thursday. They also believe 
that a second "silent partner" was involved. 
</P>
<P>
"We will find the man that leased the office. There's no problem with that," 
Caracci said. "Anybody above and beyond him, I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
One nearby business owner said he was surprised by the raid because the suspect 
earlier had told him that he sold clothes and tennis shoes at swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I had an underlying feeling that something was wrong because it was 
sort of clandestine the way trucks would be coming up and loading little 
boxes," said Dan Short, the business owner. 
</P>
<P>
John Fahel, whose family business in the same complex sells wholesale tennis 
shoes at swap meets, said the suspect telephoned his office Wednesday during 
the police raid after calling his own business and suspecting something was 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Fahel said they met within the last few weeks -- drawn together because they 
are both Arab nationals -- but had not worked together at swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not know what this guy did," Fahel said. "We do an honest living."

PROF. CICERONE NAMED TO UCI'S ALDRICH CHAIR; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: GLOBALWARMING EXPERT IS SEEN AS SOMEONE WHO CAN ENHANCE THE 
UNIVERSITY'S STATURE AS A CENTER OF RESEARCH INTO ENVIRONMENTAL DILEMMAS.

Atmospheric chemist Ralph J. Cicerone, an internationally known expert on 
global warming, was named Thursday to UC Irvine's Daniel G. Aldrich Jr. endowed 
chair, one of the university's most prestigious academic honors. 
</P>
<P>
Cicerone was wooed away from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 
1989 to launch UCI's geosciences department, which will be the first of its 
kind at a major university to study the dynamics of air, earth and sea. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the 47-year-old Cicerone was elected to the elite National Academy of 
Sciences, a lifetime appointment considered a pinnacle achievement for 
scientists. He is the second professor to hold the Aldrich Chair, named for 
UCI's founding chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nice surprise," said Cicerone, who learned of the appointment in a 
letter from Chancellor Jack W. Peltason last Friday. "It's a major honor. I 
thought the world of Chancellor Aldrich, as everyone did." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich, who died last spring, had a lifelong concern for the environment. This 
second appointment appears to mark a trend that the holder of the Aldrich chair 
be a distinguished researcher in global sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Cicerone follows his colleague, UCI chemistry professor F. Sherwood Rowland, 
who in 1974 first revealed to the world that Earth's protective ozone layer was 
being destroyed by chemicals in aerosol sprays, air conditioners and cleaning 
solvents. Rowland relinquished the Aldrich chair in 1989, when he was named the 
university's second Bren Fellow, a $1-million endowment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a natural fit," Peltason said of Cicerone's appointment to the 
chair, which has an endowment of $340,000. "I think he's a splendid academic 
citizen, and I'm very pleased that he chose to come here." 
</P>
<P>
The Aldrich Chair, founded in 1984 with a $100,000 donation from the Irvine 
Co., is one of 15 such endowments, which provide annual interest income to 
support the research of prominent scholars. 
</P>
<P>
Cicerone is widely viewed on campus as someone who can solidify and enhance 
UCI's stature as a center of research into the most pressing environmental 
dilemmas. It was Cicerone's work with Richard Stolarski of the University of 
Michigan that laid the groundwork for Rowland's ozone discovery with Mario 
Molina, now a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Cicerone also showed that gases other than carbon dioxide were instrumental in 
the warming of the atmosphere, a phenomenon known as the "greenhouse effect." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anyone more deserving than Ralph Cicerone," said Harold 
Moore, dean of UCI's School of Physical Sciences, which nominated him for the 
Aldrich Chair. "He's a scholar of the very first rank. . . . He is a man with 
not only the stellar documented academic credentials, but he also has . . . 
equally great talents in the administrative arena." 
</P>
<P>
Peltason said the geosciences department is a "natural next step" for a 
university with the talents of a Rowland and a Cicerone. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that this is one of the things for which we (UCI) will become 
famous," Peltason said. 
</P>
<P>
Cicerone said the UCI program will differ considerably from the work done at 
the federally funded nonprofit National Center for Atmospheric Research in 
Boulder, Colo., where he served as director of the atmospheric chemistry 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary emphasis there was on the atmosphere," he said. "But the 
atmosphere is not the whole story. We have to pay attention to the ocean and 
the way the ocean and atmosphere and soils interact. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be looking at a broader effort here, although the research will 
emphasize the physics, the chemistry and the biology of the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"And here, the students will be central. We will be doing not only our 
(research) work, but trying to make sure there are some awfully good people, 
better than us to work in this area in the future. . . . We think the future 
demands this." 
</P>
<P>
Cicerone said that he is poised to hire several faculty in coming months and 
that then the real work of building the department can begin. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment is expected to generate about $20,000 to $25,000 annually. 
Cicerone said he has not decided how to use the funds. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be allowed to start various research projects or employ a student to 
work on a project without any questions or lengthy (grant applications)," he 
said. "That kind of freedom is very nice to have." 
</P>
<P>
One project Cicerone is most eager to begin is a study of unusual chemicals 
being produced in seawater. He hopes to collaborate with two researchers from 
the Caltech and a Cal State Long Beach professor. He said the Aldrich Chair 
income would barely begin to cover the cost of the project but could provide a 
start.

RIGHTS HONOREE CALLS FOR HUSSEIN PROTEST;

Ginetta Sagan, a former Nazi prisoner who on Thursday received Chapman 
College's Albert Schweitzer Award for her international human rights work, said 
in an interview that people throughout the world should protest the human 
rights violations of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein has not only killed and tortured political opponents who he 
knows are political opponents, but he has gone even further, and anyone who is 
even remotely suspected of being an opponent faces destruction," she said. "He 
is a brutal human being; he is a tyrant." 
</P>
<P>
Sagan said people should write or telegram the United Nations Commission on 
Human Rights to protest Hussein's actions. She said that basic human rights, 
not world politics, are the issue. Sagan also denounced Hussein's holding of 
civilian hostages in the current Mideast crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"What he is doing violates international law," she said. "People should speak 
up about these violations of human rights. They should stand up and be 
counted." 
</P>
<P>
Sagan, 65, who lives in Atherton, Calif., helped launch the human rights 
organization Amnesty International on the West Coast. She also started her own 
human rights group, based in Atherton, called the Aurora Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Sagan's feelings for political prisoners comes from firsthand experience. 
During World War II, she was captured by the Nazis and tortured for being an 
Italian Resistance fighter. She was to be executed but was rescued in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Since regaining her freedom 45 years ago, Sagan has devoted her life to freeing 
people around the world who have been jailed and tortured for their beliefs. 
Chapman College on Thursday honored her work by presenting her with its annual 
Schweitzer award. Schweitzer, who died in 1965, was a philosopher, physician 
and missionary who won the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize for his international 
humanitarian work. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Bergel, director of the college's Albert Schweitzer Institute, told the 
student-faculty audience that Sagan was "a woman who for a lifetime has stood 
in the forefront of the fight for human rights." 
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving the award, Sagan said, "I accept this award, not only for 
myself, but on behalf of my co-workers in Amnesty International worldwide, who 
are working relentlessly in behalf of prisoners of conscience. Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Sagan stressed that her comments about Hussein and the Mideast crisis 
were her personal views. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not speaking for Amnesty International, and I must make that clear," she 
said. But she added that as an individual human rights worker, she is appalled 
at the "nightmare" conditions in Iraq under Hussein's rule. 
</P>
<P>
Sagan added, "Iraq for years, as far as violating human rights, has been a 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Sagan will be the initial speaker at 1 p.m. today as Chapman College launches 
its two-day convocation on "The Relevance of Albert Schweitzer's Life and 
Thought Today." Sagan, whose topic will be "My Struggle for Human Rights," will 
speak in the Waltmar Theatre on the Chapman College campus, 333 N. Glassell St. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 tonight in the college's Memorial Hall Auditorium, there will be a 
concert, followed immediately by a talk by British author James Brabazon on 
"Reverence for Life and the Power of the Individual: Albert Schweitzer as a 
Guide for Today and Tomorrow." Brabazon, of London, is the author of a 
Schweitzer biography. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday at 9 a.m. in Waltmar Theatre, Robert Livingstone, of International 
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, will speak on "Approaches to 
World Peace." 
</P>
<P>
All sessions today and Saturday are free and open to the public.

MIKE PENNER: NFL NEWS YOU CAN'T BANK ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER

<TEXT>
<P>
Pay no mind to the flood of magazines, newspapers, newsletters, pamphlets, 
flyers, skywriters and men on the street trying to tell you who's going to do 
what in the National Football League this fall. 
</P>
<P>
That's easy. 
</P>
<P>
We are here to offer more. We are here to tell you what won't happen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rams won't catch the 49ers but it won't be because of their September 
problems. December is the real problem -- five final games played at Cleveland, 
against New Orleans and San Francisco at home, at Atlanta and at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The Back-In-Black Atlanta Falcons won't do anything for Jerry Glanville's 
reputation this year. His team will play like thugs, run up the score, be 
universally despised, and, once it makes the playoffs, lose in the first round 
to someone it should beat. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie DeBartolo Jr. won't flinch when he signs over the check to pay his 
$500,000 fine. He knows he got off easy. 
</P>
<P>
Training camp won't seem more than an orchestrated waste of time if Don 
Majkowski comes right in and throws for another 4,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Dilweg won't make it through one NFL start. If the Rams are ahead in 
the second half Sunday, it'll be Majik. 
</P>
<P>
Boomer Esiason won't have to apologize for his Joe Namath impression. 
Cincinnati, as Boomer has guaranteed, is going to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, that means Denver won't. 
</P>
<P>
The average NFL game won't last longer than puberty anymore, thanks to the new 
keep-the-clock-running mercy rules. 
</P>
<P>
Won't the colleges copy a good thing once they see it? 
</P>
<P>
Curt Warner won't be able to fill the shoes of the little dwarf -- but 
Cleveland Gary might. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints won't be marching anywhere until they find somebody -- not Bobby 
Hebert, not John Fourcade -- who can move the ball through the air. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff George won't be worth the interest on the $15 million he stole from the 
Colts -- or the Andre Rison/Chris Hinton CARE package Atlanta received as a 
down payment. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams won't be hammered for the Eric Dickerson trade anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay won't have the home field advantage in Super Bowl XXV, but it could 
qualify for the tournament. Some facts: In 1989, the Buccaneers lost five games 
by an average of 2.6 points, lost to San Francisco by four points and went 1-6 
when they scored less than 20 points. Since then, Vinnie Testaverde has gained 
a year's wisdom and a backfield assistant named Gary Anderson, which should 
make him smarter still. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Phoenix won't pay to watch this Cardinal team, either. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders won't go anywhere except the playoffs. They're in a weak division, 
they have Art Shell from Week 1 and they have Greg Bell, Marcus Allen, Tim 
Brown, Mervyn Fernandez, Willie Gault and, as always, latecomer Bo. 
</P>
<P>
Why won't they trade for a quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
They won't find one in Kansas City or San Diego, division rivals in search of 
the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Grogan won't retire. In this decade or any other. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas won't go 1-15 again. Jimmy Johnson has brought in one of his old runners 
(Alonzo High smith) and the Cowboys get to play Phoenix twice. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be easy picking a rooting interest when Jerry Glanville meets Buddy 
Ryan on Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka won't chill out. Chicago's defense, ranked 25th in 1989, should 
improve with the addition of USC safety Mark Carrier. Neal Anderson is the best 
runner in the league, but the quarterback cupboard is Bear. 
</P>
<P>
Announcers won't know what to do the first time Mark Carrier tackles Mark 
Carrier the first time Chicago plays Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit won't outrun and outshoot Houston this year. Andre Ware may have 
majored in the philosophy, but Jack Pardee holds the Ph.D. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana won't film another TV commercial if Nolan Ryan won't. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Wilson still won't be the man who leads the Vikings back to the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be Herschel Walker, either. Minnesota should have kept trading with 
Dallas until Steve Walsh was on board as well. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta won't be the most improved team in the league. Look instead to the New 
York Jets, who now have Blair Thomas in the backfield, Rob Moore at wide 
receiver, the benefit of a last-place schedule and a coach, Bruce Coslet, who 
knows how to pump up an offense. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh won't draft any more players from Liberty U. Rookie Eric Green 
remains a holdout, making the Steelers the only team in the league to open the 
season without its No. 1 draft choice. Which is the real tight end in these 
negotiations -- Pittsburgh or Green? 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland won't have to worry about losing another AFC final to Denver. 
Finishing last, though, is another topic. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco won't win a third consecutive Super Bowl because Cincinnati won't 
blow its third Super Bowl shot at San Francisco. The Bengals win by a field 
goal and Sam Wyche is lifted onto the shoulders of his players, a world 
champion football coach. 
</P>
<P>
Won't that be something?

CENTURY MARKS ITS FIRST VARSITY CONTEST AGAINST REBUILDING EL DORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the first varsity game for a high school football player is traumatic, 
imagine the effect on an entire team. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, 1-year-old Century High School will play its first football game, at 
7:30 against El Dorado at Valencia High School's Bradford Stadium. Century 
Coach Bill Brown has no illusions about how his players -- all sophomores and 
juniors with no varsity game experience -- will react. 
</P>
<P>
"We know darn well that when we take our kids up to Bradford Stadium, their 
hearts are going to be a-pounding and their diapers are going to need 
changing," Brown said. "That's natural. We've all been there. Everybody that's 
ever played the sport has felt butterflies. We expect that, but again, that's 
just part of the maturation process." 
</P>
<P>
In a quirk of scheduling, the Centurions' first varsity opponent is El Dorado, 
a team that didn't win a game last season. The Hawks are also a young team, 
with four sophomores starting, but at least they have seniors on the team. 
Century has no seniors among its 1,700 students. 
</P>
<P>
Still, as is the custom among coaches, second-year El Dorado Coach Rick Jones 
is downplaying the potential for a mismatch. 
</P>
<P>
"At this level you've got to get ready each week as if you are preparing for 
the Rams," Jones said. "It doesn't matter if you are playing Bishop Amat or 
Orange County's Pop Warner team, you've got to get ready." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Century, El Dorado is facing a team somewhere between those 
extremes. The players come mainly from Century's freshman and sophomore teams, 
which went 9-0 and 4-6, respectively, last season. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is preaching patience and preparation for the future, while trying to 
limit the importance of any single game in the Centurions' first season. One 
advantage of having such an inexperienced team is that no one will graduate 
from it. Barring transfers or grade problems, everyone will return next season. 
</P>
<P>
And it's next season and beyond that most concerns Brown, who coached at 
Brea-Olinda from 1979 until 1987. He believes he is building a firm foundation 
at Century, which next year will have between 2,100 and 2,500 students. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since three players showed up to the first informal practice in the summer 
of 1989, the program has grown steadily. Today it has 62 varsity players and 40 
freshman team members. Brown said the cornerstones of success are in place: the 
administration is supportive, money is available and three of his five 
assistants have teaching contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown hasn't begun saying, "Wait till next year." Playing its first varsity 
season in the Pacific Coast League with two-time Division VIII champion Trabuco 
Hills and last year's Sea View League champion Estancia will prove quite 
challenging, but Century's nonleague schedule isn't as daunting. Of the 
Centurions' five nonleague opponents, only Bloomington (7-3) won more than two 
games last season. One, Jurupa Valley, is also playing its first year of 
varsity competition. 
</P>
<P>
Brown has the Centurions running a triple-option wishbone offense. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can keep the plays down to a minimum and control the ball and play good 
field position, maybe at the end of the game we're going to be close," Brown 
said. "Then it just takes one break or two to win a ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
"Our big concern is conditioning right now -- how long our kids can go. We have 
a few kids that could probably play for most people, but we have an awful lot 
who are going to be on the field that would be on other people's JV teams."

FOOTHILL VS. TUSTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RECORDS -- Foothill 4-6 (last season), Tustin 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
SITE -- Tustin High School. 
</P>
<P>
FOOTHILL UPDATE -- The Knights have a talented runner in tailback Sean 
Saunders, who gained 846 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
However, for the Knights to be successful in this game and for the season, they 
will depend on senior quarterback Evan Lang, who didn't throw a pass last 
season. "There's more responsibility on Evan," Coach Marty McWhinney said. 
"He's going to have to throw well to keep everybody off Sean. If he doesn't, 
Sean will still get his 100 yards, but that's all the offense we'll get." The 
Knights will start six juniors on defense. "We are going to be good 
defensively," McWhinney said. "But not right away because of our inexperience. 
We may be overmatched this game." 
</P>
<P>
TUSTIN UPDATE -- The Tillers are coming off a 37-7 victory over Honolulu Pac-5. 
In that game, Tustin showed off its potent offense. Tailback Ron Goods gained 
117 yards and fullback Visko Ancich had 90. Quarterback Andy Borza completed 
seven of nine passes for 73 yards. Defensively, Tustin is inexperienced up 
front. However, that didn't seem to be a problem against Pac-5. The Tillers 
have a significant advantage because they have already played a game. KEY TO 
THE GAME -- Foothill's defense. It's young and untested and it's going against 
what might be the county's best offense. 
</P>
<P>
CONSENSUS -- Tustin has too much going for it. The Tillers have talent, speed 
and have played one game. Tustin by at least 10 points.

<P>
TROY VS. RANCHO ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
1989 RECORDS -- Troy 7-4, Rancho Alamitos 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
SITE -- Fullerton High School. 
</P>
<P>
TROY UPDATE -- Offense, offense and more offense. Troy has Greg Windle, the top 
quarterback in the Freeway League, and Steve Friedrich, one of the top 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Two other targets for Windle will be Chad Hartford and Ryan Russell, both 
all-league second-team receivers last season. Chad Brasington, a 6-1, 195-pound 
senior, will give Troy a solid rushing attack, running behind an offensive line 
that returns five starters. In all, Troy returns 15 starters. 
</P>
<P>
RANCHO ALAMITOS UPDATE -- Like Troy, Rancho Alamitos also returns a solid 
nucleus, with nine offensive and eight defensive players back. But the Vaqueros 
will sorely miss running back Dana Riddle, a workhorse who carried the ball 381 
times last season. All-league players Tim Starke (linebacker) and Leonard Sims 
(offensive tackle) also offer support. The Vaqueros will be inexperienced at 
quarterback with Chris Singletary, who broke his leg on the first game of the 
season last year. College scouts tab Singletary as a prospect at linebacker, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
KEY TO THE GAME -- Rancho Alamitos' secondary will be run ragged by Windle's 
strong arm and the quick Troy receivers. Rancho Alamitos' lack of depth (only 
32 players on varsity) could produce some tired players in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
CONSENSUS -- Is Troy a contender or a pretender? The Warriors want to challenge 
Sunny Hills for the Freeway League title (again) this year, and a victory in 
the season opener will get them off on the right foot.

HUNTINGTON BEACH VS. CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
1989 RECORDS -- Huntington Beach 0-10, Corona del Mar 11-3. 
</P>
<P>
SITE -- Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH UPDATE -- After months of waiting, the Oilers can take the 
sting of last season's bitter disappointment out on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, they finished 8-2 and won a share of the Sunset League championship. 
However, the Oilers were forced to forfeit all eight victories because they 
used an ineligible player in all 10 games. Tonight, the Oilers will see how 
well they rebound. Quarterback Mike Chavira will direct the Oilers' balanced 
offense. Linebackers Jeff Brentlinger, Don Berge and Gabe Houston lead a strong 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
CORONA DEL MAR UPDATE -- One of the most curious performances of the 1989 
season was turned in by the Sea Kings. They slogged through the Sea View League 
with a 2-3 record, but rallied and won the Division VI championship. The Sea 
Kings lost to Huntington Beach, 19-6, but the Oilers later forfeited the 
victory. Quarterback Todd Kehrli showed a steady hand in passing for 1,600 
yards as a sophomore. The bad news is that Jerrott Willard, the division's 
player of the year last season, and the Johnson brothers -- Warren and Weston 
-- have graduated. 
</P>
<P>
KEY TO THE GAME -- Emotion. It is vital for Huntington Beach to play hard while 
keeping its desire to show the world it is a good team and was robbed of the 
championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
CONSENSUS -- The game would seem to mean more to Huntington Beach. Add the fact 
that the Oilers have one of the best teams in the Sunset League and they should 
win.

MOUNTIES ADJUST TO SPARKS' EXIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Montclair Prep entered the post-Sparks era battered and emotionally spent but 
wearing a brave face. Of course, the Mounties have little choice. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Sparks, the uncle of Derek and Leland Sparks, picked up his nephews' 
transcripts Thursday, officially severing ties between the private school in 
Van Nuys and the two transplanted Texas football players. Derek and Leland are 
expected to leave this weekend with June Sparks, Derek's mother, who arrived 
Wednesday to take the pair home. 
</P>
<P>
The players tentatively have scheduled a farewell party Saturday at the Granada 
Hills home of Steve and Susie Goldbaum, with whom Derek lived from last winter 
until the team left for a season-opening game in Hawaii last week. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates already have begun the farewell process, saying they will miss the 
Sparkses not just as players but as friends. Derek is a 6-foot-1, 208-pound 
senior running back who is regarded as one of the area's top college prospects 
after rushing for 3,338 yards in two seasons since arriving from Texas. Leland 
(5-10, 170) quarterbacked the Mounties to a 12-1 record last year and had been 
moved to wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan Roy, a 6-foot-6 1/2, 280-pound senior offensive lineman, is one of the 
few players who has talked to Derek since the players returned from Hawaii on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost cried when I talked to him on the phone," Roy said. "I hate to see 
him go. I don't care if he doesn't play football. I just want to have him 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Roy claimed that Sparks is leaving Montclair Prep reluctantly, a view shared by 
many in the Montclair Prep community. Sparks said all summer that despite bad 
feelings between his uncle and Montclair Prep, he wanted to remain there. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Derek wants to leave," Roy said. "He told me he wants to play 
Friday night with us and he misses all the guys. But family is family and 
you've got to do what the family says. I have to respect him for that." 
</P>
<P>
Many players sensed that Derek would be taken from the team after they learned 
that the Southern Section had denied Leland Sparks' request for a fifth year of 
eligibility. Leland repeated the 11th grade when he entered Montclair Prep in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Although two other players were denied eligibility, Jerome blamed Montclair 
Prep for the decision and was angered that Leland was told just hours before 
Montclair Prep's 28-7 loss to Farrington of Hawaii on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section will hear an appeal Wednesday for tackle Rusty Savage and 
wide receiver Cardell Henderson and had planned to rule on Leland's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, there seems little anyone at Montclair Prep can do to satisfy 
Jerome Sparks, who has battled with the school since last spring when Derek 
sought refuge in Los Angeles County Juvenile Court, claiming he had been 
abandoned by his uncle -- his legal guardian at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Derek became a foster child of the Goldbaums, whose son John plays for 
Montclair Prep. The Goldbaums relinquished their role as foster parents, 
yielding to the wishes of his family. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome, who denies that he abandoned his nephew, objected to Derek's living 
arrangement and urged him to move into an apartment with Leland. Leland had 
been living in Chatsworth with the Cole family, whose son Greg also plays for 
the Mounties. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties will enter tonight's nonleague game against St. Monica at Culver 
City High with either Cole or sophomore Eliel Swinton at tailback.

WELCH SAYS THIS SEASON IS HIS LAST; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: CANYON COACH CITES DISSATISFACTION WITH HIS TEACHING WORKLOAD AS 
REASON FOR HIS RESIGNATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canyon High football Coach Harry Welch tendered his resignation Thursday 
morning, effective at the conclusion of this season, because of conflicts with 
the school's administration over his teaching workload. 
</P>
<P>
Welch, 45, said Thursday night that he is stepping down because the Canyon 
administration has been unable to add a period to his schedule that would ease 
the burden of both coaching and teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Welch said he presented Principal Bill White with his resignation after he 
showed up for the first day of classes Thursday and noticed he had not been 
given an additional planning period. 
</P>
<P>
Welch said he has been considering retirement for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to (White) in the summer, and told him that the only way I would be 
able to consider staying is if I was given more assigned time for football," 
Welch said. "He felt that wasn't what he could do at this time. I put in a 
great deal of time and I care very much about my English class. I just do not 
have enough time for both." 
</P>
<P>
White said he is not sure what to make of Welch's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"My feelings are kind of mixed because I'm not sure if the seriousness is 
behind it," White said. "Right now I'm not responding to it as something 
serious. It's just a piece of paper." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon opened its season with a 40-0 victory over Honolulu St. Louis in Hawaii, 
ending the nation's longest high school winning streak at 55 games. 
</P>
<P>
Welch said he was disturbed when the William S. Hart Union High School District 
approved release time for athletic and activity directors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at school an hour before them and six hours after they leave every day," 
Welch said. "I haven't had lunch with the faculty in seven years." 
</P>
<P>
White said he cannot meet Welch's demands. 
</P>
<P>
"We give all coaches the same treatment in the (school district)," White said. 
"I'm not at liberty to give him any more or any less. He has been treated as 
fairly as I can treat him within my jurisdiction. I'm just not mentally 
prepared to respond until I get the feeling that it is final." 
</P>
<P>
Welch, who has a 90-17-1 record, says he has no ill feelings and will continue 
to teach at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no animosity whatsoever," he said "The school district, students and 
community have been sensational to me. I truly love them." 
</P>
<P>
Welch said he would meet with White but that he wouldn't likely change his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate them offering me that assigned time," Welch said. "He's had 
a long time to think about it and he's done what he feels is right." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, which moved from Southern Section Division II to Division I this 
season, won three Southern Section titles in Welch's eight years. Canyon was 
39-1 in Golden League play under Welch and is 1-0 this season entering 
tonight's game with rival Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Welch said he would recommend nine-year assistant Brian Stiman as his 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably time for me to ride into the sunset," Welch said. "I'm concerned 
about my vocal cords and spending time with my family and my wife. I just think 
it's time. The community and school has treated me like a king for nine years."

PREP COACHES ARE LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Morningside High football Coach Ron Tatum constantly struggles to find players 
for his team. It's not that Morningside lacks good athletes. The problem is 
finding more than a few students willing to put in the time and energy to 
become top-flight players. 
</P>
<P>
"Football is one of the oldest traditional activities, but it is not socially 
accepted anymore to do the things needed to succeed in football," Tatum said. 
"The things that football demands, society doesn't demand anymore. That's why 
the number (of players coming out to play) has dwindled. Discipline is not as 
important as it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
What Tatum and other high school coaches look for is a student with the 
discipline to endure the long, hot practices of summer, work out during the 
off-season and stay academically eligible. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to get kids to come out," Tatum said. "We get some, but after 
they run a few times, get up early a few times and get hit, they disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Commitment, dedication and drive: Coaches work as hard to find high school 
students with these qualities as they do to design game plans. 
</P>
<P>
However, the problem might not be the shrinking number of potential prep stars 
with commitment. To play high school football and succeed in the classroom, 
16-, 17- and 18-year-olds need organizational skills, attitudes and 
sophistication that some adults couldn't muster. 
</P>
<P>
Being a high school football player has become a tough, year-round job. 
</P>
<P>
The required commitment began to increase when the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. introduced Proposition 48 and raised academic requirements for athletes 
entering college. 
</P>
<P>
The high schools followed the NCAA's lead and began demanding respectable 
showings from athletes in the classroom. Before that time, school was seen as 
an obstacle standing between the athlete and the football field. Today, coaches 
view grades as part of an athlete's contribution to the team. Doing well in 
class is as vital as coming to practice every day. 
</P>
<P>
Football players must also lift weights in the off-season, participate in 
summer passing leagues and, unless they are playing another sport, be available 
for workouts and meetings during the day. 
</P>
<P>
The season ends with the last game in the fall, but the athlete's obligations 
remain the same in March as in September. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the '50s and '60s, coaches were trying to get dedication from their 
players, but they really didn't have to try that hard to get it," Carson Coach 
Gene Vollnogle said. "Then it became a year-round thing, with the 
weight-lifting and the passing leagues, and it took dedication to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Yet football wasn't easy on a teen-ager even when it was played just in the 
fall. During the season, a player's typical day includes a team meeting, 
practice, taping, and getting in and out of uniform. 
</P>
<P>
At Carson, for example, players meet during lunch and practice after school for 
two hours. The practices, which Vollnogle describes as "exhausting but 
necessary," are highly concentrated and strenuous. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Carson linebacker and team captain Edgar Ta'ase enjoys keeping busy with 
football. When not involved with the team, he might be taking care of his 
duties as student body president or studying to maintain his 3.5 grade-point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Ta'ase must work hard, but he says he enjoys trying to maintain excellence in 
his many activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel any disadvantage (in the classroom)," he said. "I enjoy football 
and I don't see it as a chore. I'd rather be going to meetings, doing 
constructive things all the time, instead of sitting around. You have to be 
willing to give up the time if you are going to get what you want." 
</P>
<P>
But if you add football duties to the usual commitments of a high school 
student, such as classes, dinner and homework, there is little time for 
anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Many forces tend to pull students off the football field, ranging from extra 
time for school work to pressure from friends and family obligations. 
</P>
<P>
"For a kid to be successful, kids need to have vigilance," Tatum said. "There 
are so many things that deter kids today." 
</P>
<P>
At Bishop Montgomery, tight end-linebacker Mike Hall plays football and 
baseball, carries a 3.7 GPA and serves on the student council. Maintaining his 
hectic schedule takes time away from other activities, but Hall has seen the 
rewards of keeping organized: He has received recruiting letters from schools 
such as Stanford, USC, Notre Dame, Washington and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to keep you priorities straight," Hall said. "You do make sacrifices. 
You can't mess around with your teammates after practice; you have to go home 
and work. It does put a dent in your social life." 
</P>
<P>
Coaches say a player's first responsibilities are to school and family, but 
being a football player takes up most of the rest of a student's time. There is 
no limit to his need to build muscles or refine his football skills. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Coach Gary Kimbrell said: "On the Peninsula, the kids are very 
goal-oriented. In an affluent area like this, with smart kids, I wonder why 
they put up with it. But they do. The kids usually know how to budget their 
time. Some actually perform better in the classroom knowing that each minute 
has to be accounted for." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside linebacker Danny Katoa added: "You have to concentrate on 
everything you do. I feel a little stress, but my coaches and my family keep me 
going. I have learned that I have to be mature and I have to take charge. You 
learn to make sacrifices." 
</P>
<P>
The players are not the only ones forced to adjust. Coaches who modeled 
themselves after drill sergeants are disappearing or toning down their 
hard-line ways in response to the declining number of students willing to put 
up with such methods. 
</P>
<P>
Football hasn't all changed. Hell weeks are still hell weeks, and the grueling 
workouts still break the strongest of teen-agers, but coaches now try to better 
understand the pressures under which their players operate. For example, the 
growing importance of academics has forced coaches to provide more time and 
encouragement for players to study. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches also show more restraint in criticizing players. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gotten away from the style when a coach was a tyrant, a Vince Lombardi 
type," Bishop Montgomery Coach Steve Carroll said. "Coaches are now using 
positive reinforcement to get through to players." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's Katoa added: "Some guys playing don't have the talent. Coaches 
know (it does no good) to yell at them. They have to explain, point out the 
good things. If they can't, that player will never understand what he did 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches even worry that the year-round demands of high school football 
today may be too great for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more to life than just football," said Bill Seixas, who coached at 
San Pedro High from 1957 through 1965. "Kids should be able to enjoy other 
sports. Football has become overemphasized. The commitment for the athlete 
should be (only) for the fall season. Then he should be able to develop other 
things, like a social life and an interest in other sports." 
</P>
<P>
Current football coaches are quick to note that all their players are free to 
play other sports and should put in only the time they have available after 
fulfilling other obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Katoa is a standout wrestler at Morningside and Hall plays baseball at Bishop 
Montgomery. Neither athlete said he felt pressure to participate in football 
when he had other commitments. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when I've been in a bind between football and baseball, but 
the coaches try to help you," Hall said. "Coach Carroll really stresses grades. 
It's not like I'm on my own at school. It's definitely a strain if you play two 
or three sports, but the coaches understand." 
</P>
<P>
Besides realizing the importance of academics, coaches also seem to be learning 
players' limits. Coaches still devise ways to build a better football player, 
but their emphasis on high grade-point averages almost rivals the drive for 
bigger biceps.

NORTHRIDGE WOMEN EARN A SPLIT IN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge outside hitters Patricia Fitzsimmons and Nancy Nicholls 
took turns putting the ball away Thursday, but the latter effort came too late, 
leaving the Matadors with a split in the J. M. N. Premier volleyball tournament 
at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzsimmons spearheaded a 15-3, 15-7, 15-13 triumph over Eastern Washington, an 
NCAA Tournament qualifier last season. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls demonstrated a similarly dominant attack against California, but her 
efforts -- on a sprained ankle -- came too late to reverse a 15-11, 15-7, 
14-16, 15-11 loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors finish pool play today at 11 a.m. against Baylor, which is 0-2 in 
the tournament. CSUN needs a victory over Baylor to advance to the eight-team 
championship bracket tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"If we beat Baylor, that gives us a chance to play the better teams and that's 
where we want to be," said CSUN Coach Walt Ker after its team fell to 4-2 with 
the split. 
</P>
<P>
Before setting up Nicholls for a series of kills that forced a fourth game 
against the Golden Bears, CSUN couldn't generate an offense because it couldn't 
handle Cal's serve. 
</P>
<P>
"Our service return really broke down," Ker said. "Cal serves well to spots and 
that affects our passing system. When we get flat passing, it should raise the 
level of your blocking, attack and defense but the opposite happened to us." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN fell behind 6-0 in its first game against the Golden Bears, but rallied to 
make it 9-6. From there, CSUN was competitive, but unable to sustain a scoring 
streak long enough to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors trailed again early in the second game and never recovered. Cal 
led 9-2 in the third game, but CSUN rallied for the win. In the final game, 
CSUN trailed, 13-4, before making it respectable. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Coach Dave DeGroot wasn't surprised by the Matadors' comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Walt Ker) is a great coach," DeGroot said. "That's a team that'll never 
give up. All they had to do was get on a serving streak. They will only get 
better in Division I playing the better teams. We just had a little more power 
in the middle and the outside tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The same could be said of CSUN in its match against Eastern Washington, 
particularly of Fitzsimmons who finished with 13 kills for a 50% attack rate. 
</P>
<P>
"That's her best attacking by far," Ker said. "The neat thing is that she 
picked a smart attack line. Her choices are smarter. She's becoming a thinking 
hitter. It's fun to watch the evolution." 
</P>
<P>
In the first game of its match with Eastern Washington, CSUN coasted. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring three times on its initial possession, the Eagles did not score 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's offense came in spurts -- three consecutive points to tie it 3-3, 
four more after a single point and a sideout for an 8-3 lead and four 
consecutive points at the end for the 15-3 final. Left-hander Karen Scholl 
served aces on two of the last three points to punctuate the Matador effort. 
</P>
<P>
After Eastern Washington gained a 3-2 edge in the second game, CSUN exploded 
for five consecutive points, including a service ace by Scholl, a kill by Dawn 
Krenik and a kill, over the middle block, by Fitzsimmons. 
</P>
<P>
A CSUN error gave the Eagles possession, but Northridge won the ball back 
immediately on a service error. With Shelly Swalec serving, CSUN reeled off 
four straight for an 11-3 advantage, three of the points coming off Eastern 
Washington spikes that went out of bounds; the fourth was on Kathleen Dixon's 
block. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles pulled together to make it 11-7, but CSUN answered with four points 
in a row for the win. 
</P>
<P>
Just when a three-game sweep was starting to look easy, Eastern Washington 
asserted itself in taking an 8-0 lead in the third game. Five of the points 
came off Matador errors. Twice, CSUN let kills go that it thought were long 
only to have them stay in. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, CSUN worked its way into the match, pulling within four at 8-4.

MARY STAR SHINES BRIGHT IN 28-9 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rolling Hills and Mary Star High Schools started the football season a day 
before most the rest of the Southern Section at Daniels Field in San Pedro on 
Thursday night, with the usual first-game rustiness. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Star won, 28-9, but from the look of the first half, both teams seemed as 
if they could have used a bit more preparation. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Matt Redlew fumbled the ball away on the Titans' one-yard line to 
end the Stars' first drive. The Stars also allowed a second-quarter safety when 
a center snap sailed over the head of punter Jose Bermudez and into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
Redlew ran back a first-quarter punt 29 yards for the game's first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Coulter, Rolling Hills' deluxe running back, ran into a roadblock in his 
quest for a second 1,500-yard season. Coulter finished with 30 yards on 12 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Orlando swept around the right side for a 14-yard touchdown run on Mary 
Star's first possession of the second half, giving the Stars a 14-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Option quarterback Nick Mariani capped the scoring with touchdown runs of one 
and five yards. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills got its only touchdown on a 22-yard pass from Bill DeMucci to 
Matt Kuptz in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Serra 38, Pasadena 0 -- Halfback Jerald Henry rushed for 98 yards and four 
touchdowns, all in the first half, to lead the Cavaliers in a non-league season 
opener at Pasadena City College. 
</P>
<P>
Henry scored on runs of two, 42, eight and 46 yards as Serra opened a 24-0 
halftime lead. The Cavaliers scored two more TDs in the fourth quarter on a 
38-yard pass from quarterback Alex Marcelin to Clayton Cutrer and a 47-yard run 
by Louis Williams.

PARACLETE TAKES COMMAND IN 2ND HALF TO WIN, 21-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL OLSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paraclete High appeared to be grossly undermanned when it took the Larrabee 
Stadium field in Ventura to meet St. Bonaventure on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But the small 26-man squad of Paraclete took charge in the second half and 
running back George Ordaz rushed for 125 yards and a touchdown to lead the 
Spirits to a 21-0 win over St. Bonaventure in a nonleague opener for both 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Ordaz, a 5-foot-10, 200-pound senior, broke open a scoreless game in the third 
quarter, breaking three tackles on a nine-yard run with 9 minutes 25 seconds 
left in the quarter to give Paraclete a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Running mate John Harris (nine carries, 42 yards) gave Paraclete a 14-0 lead on 
the Spirits' next possession, capping a nine-play, 57-yard drive with a 
five-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Harris raced eight yards for a touchdown with 1:45 left to lock up the victory 
for first-year Coach Jim Nattoli. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to get the first one," Nattoli said. "I just wanted them to hit 
hard and they responded well and the defense played with intensity." 
</P>
<P>
"George (Ordaz) was a powerhouse again tonight, like always," Nattoli added. 
</P>
<P>
"Paraclete was very physical and we made some mistakes on some scoring 
opportunities that took us out of the game," St. Bonaventure Coach Jon Mack 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Tony Noblin led the St. Bonaventure offense with 36 yards.

<P>
Canyon (1-0) vs. Hart (0-0), nonleague 
</P>
<P>
At College of the Canyons: 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't as much a game as it is an event in the Santa Clarita Valley. "Wait 
till you see it," Canyon Coach Harry Welch said. "In this community, you will 
be there." Canyon has added more intrigue to the rivalry with its stunning 40-0 
win over Honolulu St. Louis at Aloha Stadium last week, snapping that school's 
55-game winning streak. Tailback David McDivitt, coming back from a severe 
concussion suffered over the summer, rushed for 207 yards against a defense 
that allowed just 178 rushing yards in 1989. But in Hart, Canyon faces size, 
speed and talent and a team the Cowboys have not beaten in three years. Mike 
Herrington, in his second year as Hart coach, is trying to become the first 
Hart coach to defeat Canyon twice in a row since Welch arrived at Canyon nine 
years ago. Hart senior lineman Tim DeGroote (6-foot-3, 260 pounds) is a 
potential high school All-American and George Kase (6-3, 220) has a 
school-record 18 sacks as an end and also will play tight end this year. Even 
Welch appreciates Kase's style, calling him a "wild, crazy and marvelous 
football player." Hart quarterback Ryan Connors, who led the sophomore team to 
the Foothill League title last season, will make his varsity debut before an 
expected crowd of about 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake (0-0) vs. Buena (0-0), nonleague 
</P>
<P>
At Ventura High: 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Buena won this shoot-out, 35-30. Again, it could be a high-scoring 
affair. Westlake's potent offense is led by senior quarterback Todd Preston, 
who has thrown for 3,152 yards and 25 touchdowns in two seasons. Seamus 
Gibbons, who caught 36 passes last year, was projected as Westlake's 
multipurpose offensive threat but has been slowed by a knee injury. He is 
expected to play but is not in top condition. Receiver Erik Holcomb (34 
receptions) and tight end Dave Monheim (31) provide Preston with reliable 
targets. Buena lost many of its skill players from last year's 6-5 team that 
finished second in the Channel League. But the Bulldogs have a large, 
experienced offensive line that is led by tackles Steve Sawyer (6-3, 260) and 
Phil Kurta (6-2, 220), center Greg Lyle (6-1, 195), and guards Pat Kelly (5-11, 
225) and Brent Tingle (5-9, 175). "We expect them to have a solid offense and 
aggressive defense," Westlake Coach Jim Benkert said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (0-0) vs. San Marcos (0-0), nonleague 
</P>
<P>
At San Marcos: 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks has the Marmonte League's toughest nonleague schedule, and it 
kicks off with the Royals, who should be strong contenders for the Channel 
League title. Thousand Oaks also will play host to Buena, another Channel 
League contender, and will travel to Canyon, the Golden League favorite. "It's 
just a killer schedule," Coach Bob Richards said. Yet the Lancers, the 
defending Marmonte champions, are expected to hold their own. Offensively, 
Thousand Oaks is led by quarterback Scott Peterson, tailback Cory Bowen and 
receiver Jeff Watts. Richards says the Lancers' traditionally strong defense 
might begin the season slowly because of inexperience. But Richards also 
believes that the Lancers will have a potent offense from the start. San Marcos 
is led by tailback Mark Castelo, a 5-10, 175-pound senior who rushed for 1,700 
yards and 22 touchdowns as a junior. Quarterback David Lopez was a second-team 
all-league pick last season and is considered the league's best at his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo (0-0) vs. Oxnard (0-0), nonleague 
</P>
<P>
At Oxnard: 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo has not beaten Oxnard since 1984, when the Scorpions won the Coastal 
Conference championship and handed the Yellowjackets a 49-7 defeat in the 
second round of the playoffs. Oxnard has beaten Camarillo five consecutive 
times, but that streak might end because Camarillo has its most talented team 
in five years. Tight end Eric Swendemen (6-4, 225) and two-way tackle Eric 
Jensen (6-3, 220) are attracting Division I interest. Senior quarterback Corey 
Tucker will lead a wishbone offense with the aid of sophomore tailback Fehel 
Campbell and junior fullback Tag Johnson. Camarillo Coach Carl Thompson says 
Johnson (5-11, 200) is the best fullback Camarillo has had in at least five 
years. Oxnard's dynamic duo of fullback Bryant Taylor and quarterback Johnel 
Turner, who accounted for more than 2,000 rushing yards last season, has moved 
on to Moorpark College. But senior tailback Kenyon Lewis (6-2, 190) is one of 
the best backs in the Channel League. Larry Bumpus, a sophomore, will start at 
quarterback for the Yellowjackets, who are inexperienced and expected to finish 
in the bottom half of the league standings. "They're supposed to be a little 
down, but they're a big school and they always have a lot of speed," Thompson 
said. "I'm sure they'll come up with a very good team." 
</P>
<P>
Redlands (0-0) vs. Crespi (1-0), nonleague 
</P>
<P>
At Pierce College: 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
After defeating Kahuku High, 21-14, in Honolulu last week, Crespi will turn its 
attention to Redlands, ranked third in the preseason Southern Section Division 
I poll. "We've been so busy since we got back that we haven't had the time to 
focus on them," Crespi Coach Tim Lins said. But expect Redlands tailback Marcus 
Rogers to be foremost on Lins' mind tonight. The 6-0, 155-pound senior, a 
Division I choice at defensive back, gained 177 yards and scored both 
touchdowns in the Terriers' victory over Crespi in last season's opener. 
Cornerback Shawn Collins (6-0, 155), whose brother Mark is a cornerback for the 
New York Giants, quarterback Julian Burrola (6-1, 178) and fullback Mike Dragna 
(5-8, 175) also return for Redlands. Crespi will rely on the arm of junior Cody 
Smith, who completed 14 of 25 passes for 195 yards and three touchdowns against 
Kahuku. Wide receiver Ryan Kieling caught eight passes for 104 yards and two 
touchdowns against Kahuku and sophomore tailback Torie Lee rushed for 89 yards 
and had two receptions, including a 45-yard catch in the fourth quarter for the 
winning score. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood (0-0) vs. Notre Dame (0-0), nonleague 
</P>
<P>
At Notre Dame: 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
As far as preseason tests go, Lynwood will be more like a final exam for Notre 
Dame. First-year Lynwood Coach Bob Carpenter inherits 14 starters from last 
year's 5-5 team, which handed Division III champion Paramount its only loss 
last season. "They've got a good group of athletes," Notre Dame Coach Kevin 
Rooney said. Lynwood figures to be Paramount's major challenger in the San 
Gabriel Valley League and is ranked eighth in the preseason Division II poll. 
"They run a lot of the option and it's difficult to defend. We can't give up 
the big plays." Rooney is especially concerned with the quickness of Eugene 
Jackson (5-10, 175), an All-Division III selection at defensive back last 
season who will start at quarterback, and running back Theodore Anderson (5-10, 
180). Lynwood's offensive line will be anchored by 6-5, 270-pound William 
Goode. Notre Dame's defense will rely on returning ends Anthony Rodgriguez 
(6-2, 190) and Paul Garcia (6-4, 217) and newcomer junior Greg Winter (5-10, 
170). Steve Colella (6-5, 205) will start his first varsity game at quarterback 
for Notre Dame, but he has been impressive in summer passing leagues. Kirk 
Miller (6-1, 185), who averaged 22 yards a reception last season, and Vinnie 
Orlando (6-0, 170) will be Colella's primary targets. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park (0-0) vs. Chaminade (0-0-1), nonleague 
</P>
<P>
At Chaminade: 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Chaminade defense was its best offense in its opener in Hawaii last week. 
The Eagles needed a fumble recovery by Bill Blair in the final two minutes 
against Konawaena to forge a 6-6 tie but missed an opportunity to win when Amy 
Cook missed the extra point. And the Chaminade offense, which gained only 198 
yards and had five turnovers, was its own worst enemy. Quarterback Jeff Meyer 
(6-0, 180) passed for 126 yards but threw two interceptions. Newbury Park Coach 
George Hurley considers the Panthers' defense to be his team's strength -- as 
it was last season. John Obringer (6-0, 195), Jeff Epstein (6-3, 220), Sean 
McKeown (6-3, 220) and nose tackle Todd Bisacchi (5-10, 195) are the mainstays 
of the defensive line. Offensively, Newbury Park shows promise at the skill 
positions with wide receiver Jason Smith (5-6, 150) and running back Walter 
Thomas (5-6, 150). Quarterback Zak Sutton (5-7, 140) is untested but has shown 
potential during summer passing leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep (0-1) vs. St. Monica (0-0), nonleague 
</P>
<P>
At Culver City High: 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Montclair Prep is without its superstar tailback Derek Sparks. On 
Wednesday, Derek and his cousin, Leland Sparks, were pulled out of school by 
their uncle, Jerome, and apparently will return home to Texas. Montclair Prep 
is left with a gigantic hole in the backfield. Coach George Giannini's 
response? "I would think that any good young football player in the San 
Fernando Valley who would like to gain 2,000 yards this year would apply to 
Montclair Prep," he said. Until those applications start flowing, Giannini will 
go with either Greg Cole or Eliel Swinton at tailback. Swinton, a sophomore, is 
the younger brother of Washington State standout running back Rich Swinton, a 
Montclair Prep graduate. Fullback Neimad Durham is doubtful because of an ankle 
injury. The Mounties lost their opener, 28-7, to Farrington High of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill (0-0) vs. South Bakersfield (0-0), nonleague 
</P>
<P>
At South Bakersfield: 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Quartz Hill quarterback position, in doubt at the start of practice, has 
been won by junior Jake Haro, who "looked really good in practice," according 
to Coach John Albee. Quartz Hill defeated South Bakersfield last year, 17-0, at 
Quartz Hill. South Bakersfield, a powerhouse a few years back, has not been as 
strong of late. Still, Albee says, "it should be a real good opener for us."

<TEXT>
<P>
The resurgent Los Angeles Heat, winner of seven of nine games, plays host to 
the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Veterans Stadium in 
Long Beach in the first game of the American Professional Soccer League West 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
The two-game home-and-home playoff series resumes Wednesday at Spartan Stadium 
in San Jose. If the series ends in a tie, a 30-minute mini-game -- with penalty 
kicks, if necessary -- will decide the championship. The winner plays for the 
APSL title in Boston on Sept. 22 against the East Champion Maryland Bays. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks opened the year with a league-record seven consecutive 
victories. They are in the APSL West final for the second consecutive season.

ASICS TIGER NETS TWO ENDORSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to add a little celebrity panache to its image, athletic shoemaker ASICS 
Tiger Inc. on Thursday signed two NBA basketball stars -- Charles Smith of the 
Los Angeles Clippers and Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons -- to endorse its 
basketball shoes. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese shoemaker, which has its U.S. distribution headquarters in 
Fountain Valley, also extended its endorsement contract with a third NBA star, 
former Laker Kurt Rambis, now of the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
The athletes have signed multiyear contracts that will include product 
endorsement of ASICS basketball footwear and apparel, personal appearances, 
sponsored youth and community basketball camps, and appearances in the 
company's ongoing national advertising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which had sales of $140 million last year, did not reveal how much 
the athletes would be paid. 
</P>
<P>
"We are proud to be working with athletes who are so highly regarded 
professionally, personally and morally, and who reflect our balanced-lifestyle 
philosophy," said Peter Goehrig, vice president and general manager of ASICS 
Tiger. 
</P>
<P>
ASICS is an acronym for the Latin term anima sana in corpore sano, meaning a 
sound mind in a sound body. 
</P>
<P>
In July, ASICS Tiger launched a $10-million advertising campaign to sell its 
Gel-SpotLyte basketball shoes. The soles of the shoes are filled with gel 
capsules, which are supposed to absorb shock and weigh less than the "pump" 
shoes made by Reebok International Ltd. and Nike Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The ASICS Tiger ads feature a one-on-one basketball game between a player 
wearing a pump shoe and a player wearing the gel shoe. ASICS Tiger officials 
said they hope that the comparison will help piggyback their ad on the 
bigger-budget ad campaigns of Nike and Reebok.

CONCRETE FIRM IN SANTA ANA TO BE ACQUIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBR Cement Corp. of San Mateo said Thursday that it has agreed to acquire 
Standard Concrete Products Inc., a Santa Ana concrete producer with annual 
sales of $75 million. Financial terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Standard, which employs more than 300 people, operates eight ready-mix concrete 
plants and a sand and rock company in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
"This provides us an opportunity to move into a growing market in Southern 
California," said Lesley Yarborough, a CBR Cement spokeswoman, 
</P>
<P>
Yarborough said they expect the transaction to close by Oct. 1, provided the 
deal receives the necessary regulatory approvals. David Horowitz, Standard's 
president, said he doesn't expect any changes in the company's operations. 
</P>
<P>
"They (CBR executives) told us that they operate their companies in a 
decentralized way, allowing subsidiaries to operate separately," he added. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second major U.S. acquisition by CBR Cement, the North American 
subsidiary of Cimenteries CBR S.A., Belgium's largest cement manufacturer. Two 
years ago, the Belgian firm acquired the former Monolith Portland Cement Co. in 
Burbank, for $16.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
With annual sales of $1.1 billion, Cimenteries has concrete and aggregate 
operations in Western Europe and North America. It entered the U.S. and 
Canadian market in 1986 by acquiring the former Genstar Corp.'s West Coast and 
western Canadian operations.

JOSEPH N. BELL: ICARUS DONE IN BY O.C.'S TERMINAL ILLNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a real joy to see that we finally found a problem with the new terminal at 
John Wayne Airport that is worthy of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, all this blather about running millions of dollars over budget and 
opening almost six months late got pretty boring. It took a long time, but at 
last we stumbled into the area of morality, which we do -- and I say this in 
all modesty and will defend our position stoutly -- better than any other place 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
I'm talking, of course, about the outrageously naked figure on the artwork 
selected -- and then rejected -- by the airport arts commissioners as a poster 
to commemorate the opening of the new terminal building. The fact that the 
figure -- painted by New York artist Jim Morphesis -- happened to be that of a 
mythical Greek named Icarus and was quite appropriate, since it related rather 
directly to flight, didn't negate the fact of his nakedness. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that one of the airport commissioners, Bob Cashman, who is a 
commercial printer, offered generously to print the posters free of charge. 
That is, until he got a look at Icarus. Then he had some second thoughts. 
Cashman's main complaint was that there were no airplanes in the painting and 
he was afraid that the poster might become "controversial" because of its 
nudity and thereby detract from the celebra tion of the new terminal. He might 
be right. I can envision Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach) making a mailing 
of the poster, saying this is what we have come to even in this last bastion of 
morality in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Cashman's comments resulted in an emergency meeting of the five-member 
Airport Arts Commission, which first said, in effect, "Let's get on with this." 
Then two days later, the commissioners reversed themselves and decided to abort 
the poster. Fine work of art, they said, but now it's too late to get it 
printed before the opening ceremonies. The bluenoses won again, and we revert 
to cowboys instead of winged Greeks to symbolize our airport. 
</P>
<P>
It has occurred to me that probably not very many Orange Countians are familiar 
with the legend of Icarus. There was this king named Minos who hired a 
contractor named Daedalus to build a labyrinth for him. Minos wanted to get rid 
of a dude named Theseus who was threatening to run for king. Minos was afraid 
of the political effects of just putting out a contract on Theseus, so he hit 
on this labyrinth that Daedalus was to design in such a way that Theseus could 
never find his way out. 
</P>
<P>
Well, as you've probably guessed, Theseus did get out. And instead of being mad 
at Theseus, Minos took out his wrath on poor old Daedalus and ordered him 
locked up in a high tower on a desolate, deserted island. The only satisfaction 
allowed Daedalus was the company of his teen-age son, Icarus (pronounced 
Ick'-rus). 
</P>
<P>
Icarus helped his father get out of the tower, but getting off the island was 
another matter entirely. By Minos' orders, no ships were allowed to stop there, 
and it was much too far to swim to the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
But Daedalus' skills were not limited to labyrinths. He said: "Minos may 
control the land and sea, but he doesn't control the air." Then he told his son 
to gather up all the gull feathers he could find on the island. Icarus found a 
lot of them, and Daedalus took these feathers and used wax and thread to shape 
them into two sets of human-sized wings. 
</P>
<P>
Daedalus tried the wings first and found they worked magnificently. Then he 
helped Icarus to solo, instructing him to watch the birds and copy the way they 
used their wings since there were no F-10s or 747s around at the time. Icarus 
discovered he could fly too, and turned into a hot pilot overnight, doing 
wingovers and outside loops with reckless abandon -- so much so that before 
they took off for the mainland, Daedalus warned his son to stay close to his 
father because if he flew too low the fog and spray would clog his wings, and 
if he got too high, the sun would melt the wax that held them together. 
</P>
<P>
Well, you know how headstrong kids can be. Icarus said, "Sure, sure," and 
stayed with the old man for a while, flying low and slow. But then Icarus got 
bored and saw some fluffy clouds above him and thought it would be fun to play 
in them so he climbed through the clouds, and that felt so good he figured he'd 
take a quick peek at heaven before he rejoined his father. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out he got more than a quick peek. The closer Icarus approached the 
sun, the hotter it got and the more the wax holding his wings together melted. 
Icarus ignored the warning feathers that began to fall out and kept climbing 
until his wings disintegrated and he fell into the sea and drowned. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a little hazy about the moral here, but I think it is this: The people who 
run John Wayne Airport should be very careful not to allow too many flights in 
and out or all of their planes are likely to fall into the sea. Or maybe it's 
that sometimes a featherhead finds his way onto an airport commission. Or maybe 
there was no moral at all, since the Greeks of that day were notorious for 
being short on morals. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, as I write this, it would appear that the poster is dead and we 
may never even get to see the painting, since the artist is understandably edgy 
about having any more dealings with the airport people in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
If someone had asked me -- and clearly no one did -- I could have suggested 
several courses of action that might well have saved the poster. We could: 
</P>
<P>
1. Airbrush out whatever shows of Icarus' genitalia. After all, this has very 
little to do with the symbolism of flight. 
</P>
<P>
2. Dress him. Admittedly, it would be tough getting a shirt over a pair of 
wings, but Icarus could certainly pull on a pair of pants. They would be a 
definite drag while flying, but what the hell, a little compromise won't hurt. 
After all, this is mythology. 
</P>
<P>
3. Substitute a commercial aircraft in flight for Icarus. The landing gear, of 
course, should be retracted; if the gear is down, it should be discreetly 
covered with a breechcloth. 
</P>
<P>
But now it's too late, and we'll celebrate airport dedication week posterless. 
If there is anything positive to all this, I suppose it would be that for a few 
brief, shining hours we allowed a little culture to intrude on our new airport 
terminal. But by God, we woke up in time and stayed true to our lights and 
traditions. No naked Greek is going to corrupt this public event. Not in Orange 
County.

BREEDING BIRD: BLACK-HEADED GROSBEAK: (PHEUCTICUS MELANOCEPHALUS) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Doris Shields / Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Description: Large, stocky finch-like bird with an outsized triangular bill. 
Males are dull orange-brown on breast, collar and rump with black head, and 
bold black and white wings; female plumage is buffier with sparrow-like streaks 
on wings. 
</P>
<P>
In flight, both sexes show yellow wing linings. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Commonly found in open woodland, thickets and near edges of ponds. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Seeds, nuts, some fruits and occasionally spiders. 
</P>
<P>
Voice: Song consists of rising and falling passages; resembles a robin's call 
but is more melodious and mellow. The sound is a sharp ik or eek. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Courting male performs song flights above female with his tail and 
wings spread while singing almost continuously, then returns to original perch. 
Song flights often occur during incubation of eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Loosely built of twigs, stems and rootlets, then lined with finer stems 
and soft, green rootlets; nest is built in three to four days. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: One inch and pale blue, green or a bluish-green, marked with browns or 
purples, especially at larger end. 
</P>
<P>

On Labor Day he hung out with the masses in his shirt sleeves at Mile Square 
Park in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But two nights later, it was suit-and-tie time for Sen. Pete Wilson. Not only 
was the Republican gubernatorial candidate in one of Irvine Cove's toniest 
homes -- 6,500 square feet of marbled grandeur belonging to builder Tom Tucker 
and his wife, Joyce -- he was with some of the Grand Old Party's most generous 
glitterati. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Team 100 player Kathryn Thompson -- donor of $100,000 to the 
President Bush campaign -- was on hand with her husband, Gus Owen. (Team 100 
player William Lyon also would have been at the bash, Tom Tucker said, but he 
was vacationing in Hawaii.) 
</P>
<P>
Others on the $1,000-per-couple scene: Mary and Peter Muth with their son 
Richard, and his wife, Nancy; Pat and Marvin Weiss; Allen and Susan Boerner; 
Leo and Ruth Cook; Raya and Mel Jaffee; and, co-hosting with the Tuckers -- 
Richard and Cecilia Goodman and Judy and Michael Lapin. 
</P>
<P>
Gayle Wilson, who flew in from Washington for the two-hour buffet reception, 
preceded her husband to the party. "It's a busy time," she said, stealing a 
minute to sit down in the Tucker's buff-tone movie theater. "Republicans need 
to get out and work. We can't take this (election) for granted." 
</P>
<P>
As guests waited for the senator to appear, they sipped libations and enjoyed 
tours of the Tucker's Mediterranean-style manse. Up for oohing and ahhing: the 
theater, of course (which, when you took a seat in one of its comfy lounge 
chairs, felt like being in first class on a jumbo jet); a kitchen paved in gray 
granite; and an on-a-clear-day-you-can-see-Hong-Kong ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe I live in this house," said Tom Tucker, after pointing out his 
marble-clad shower with its stereo, television and telephone. "Being an 
American means having opportunity. And opportunity is something you borrow. You 
have the responsibility to return it to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday that somebody else was Sen. Pete Wilson, a man who, Tucker hopes, 
will become governor and, Tucker hopes, will someday become President. "Wilson 
is progressive and bright," Tucker said. "Typically, not what we see in 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his arrival, Wilson posed for keepsake pictures with the 
Tuckers and their daughters, Jennifer, 13, and Sara, 16. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was out to the pool area for a 15-minute talk about his stand on crime 
prevention, education and universal prenatal care. "It's wonderful to be here 
in this typical California home," Wilson teased as he began. "Thanks for 
sharing it with me." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the crowd: Joan and Gerald Garner; Ted and Georgianna Hales (she did 
the interior design on the Tucker home and Willa Dean and William Lyon's Coto 
de Caza mansion); Anabel and John Konwiser; Rabbi Mark Miller and his wife, 
Wendy; Cathy and Steven Militzok; David Rickey; Mary Rubenstein; Meryl and 
Henry Schrimmer and Larry and Jill Tucker.

STYLE: A FASHION SHOW FOR THE MAN WHO DRESSED MARILYN MONROE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As costume designer for the 1955 movie "The Seven-Year Itch," Bill Travilla 
found himself scratching his head over a troublesome scene. 
</P>
<P>
The script placed Marilyn Monroe in New York City on a hot, sticky summer day. 
Travilla had to figure out how best to show off Monroe's incredible beauty in 
the midst of all that gray ugliness. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have my precious baby standing over a grate," he remembers 
thinking. "I want her to look fresh and clean." 
</P>
<P>
His solution: A simple pleated halter dress in ecru georgette that, as the 
world now knows, happens to catch a current of air just right. 
</P>
<P>
"The dress was cool and clean in a dirty, dirty city," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Travilla designed costumes for 11 of Monroe's movies. He will show his most 
famous Monroe designs at "The Center of Fashion," a fashion show presented by 
The Guilds of the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa on Sept. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
Originals of the gowns won't be modeled because they have been lost or sold. 
Travilla himself discarded many of Monroe's old costumes years ago. "I threw 
them out," he says. "I had no idea of their value. It's incredible what that 
lady means today." 
</P>
<P>
Designs to be featured in the show include the gold-pleated gown he designed 
for Monroe in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" and the "Seven-Year Itch" dress, 
Travilla's favorite creation. "It's the most famous dress in the world," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Travilla shared a close working relationship with Monroe. She was the perfect 
vessel for his designs. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've ever known paradise, that was Marilyn," he says, still sounding 
smitten with the platinum-haired star. "She was the most feminine woman, the 
most perfect girl I'd ever known. I can't remember a flaw." 
</P>
<P>
To him, Monroe was a child playing the role of a Hollywood star. 
</P>
<P>
"Marilyn was two people. One would come in for a fitting, giggling and darling. 
She'd sit in my lap like a 5-year-old girl. Then, in a split second, she'd be 
the most sensuous woman who ever lived." 
</P>
<P>
When describing her off-screen behavior, Travilla often sounds like an 
indulgent parent. 
</P>
<P>
"She was always late for an appointment," he says. "If I said 10 a.m., I'd be 
lucky if she'd be there at 4 p.m., if not the next day. Of course, she'd be 
calling all day saying, 'I'll be there, I'll be there.' " 
</P>
<P>
The two would go to lunch at a cafe on the studio lot, where producers and 
actors would be hunched over tables noisily talking shop. Monroe would show up 
in a glamorous wrap-around negligee with huge ostrich sleeves that Travilla had 
designed for her. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all stars had the guts to do it," Travilla recalls. "When she'd walk in, 
all talk would stop. She was so breathtakingly beautiful. Bette Davis would see 
her, and her fork would stop in midair." 
</P>
<P>
Travilla, now in his 60s, has always had an eye for beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Born on scenic Santa Catalina Island, he spent his childhood exploring the 
island and diving into the ocean to study underwater treasures. His father, 
Jack, set a record for long-distance underwater swimming that has never been 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
As he grew up, Travilla discovered a new kind of beauty. He began sketching 
women, then drawing clothes that would make them look more beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
"Designing is the same as drawing," he says. "It's all lines." 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, he worked under contract with Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox. 
He won an Academy Award for "The Adventures of Don Juan" with Errol Flynn and 
received four additional Oscar nominations. 
</P>
<P>
Travilla took a hiatus from fashion and films during the "jeans era," retiring 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"My kind of clothes weren't needed," he says. "It was a bad scene for women." 
</P>
<P>
After spending six years in Spain on a beach near Cartagena, swimming and 
diving much as he did in Catalina during his boyhood, he returned to Los 
Angeles in 1977. Since his return, he's continued to design costumes for film 
and television, receiving an Emmy for "Movieola" in 1980 and for "Dallas" in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Travilla prides himself on designing clothes that are pretty, with lines that 
flatter the figure. 
</P>
<P>
"My clothes reflect my love for women. I want women to be pretty. That's how I 
dressed Marilyn. She was totally covered, not revealed. In all of the films 
Marilyn has done, she has never been vulgar in clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Travilla has always stood apart from the rest of couture designers. He shuns 
other designers' fashion shows. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't go see them. I don't like to see their fashions. I have no interest," 
he says. "I get my ideas by going away from fashion." 
</P>
<P>
He draws inspiration for design by traveling alone to Africa and riding deep 
into jungles not recommended for tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to really rough places. The people are beautiful -- the colors, the 
warriors, the beads. The more primitive the people, the better." 
</P>
<P>
It's a chance to get away from the celebrity that goes with being a costume 
designer for Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies grab me and ask, 'Do you like what I'm wearing?' " he says, shaking his 
head. "I love being with people who take me as I am." A man with an eye for 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Travilla will be introduced during the benefit fashion show, which begins at 
2:30 p.m. Sept. 18 at Segerstrom Hall in the Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
A champagne reception will be held in the lobbies of the center at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Fashion Island in Newport Beach and South Coast Plaza in Costa 
Mesa, the show will feature fashions from 22 stores and boutiques and couture 
fashions from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
A two-act performance produced by Carlton Burnett will include multiple set 
changes, music, lasers and dancers as well as more than 100 models, most of 
them guild members. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets range from $10 to $75 and are on sale at the center's box office or by 
calling (714) 740-2000 or (213) 480-3232.

THE GALLERIES' FALL OFFENSIVE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: L.A. GALLERIES MOBILIZE FOR BIGGEST FALL SEASON EVER. A RECORD 75 
EXHIBITION OPENINGS ARE SCHEDULED THIS WEEK, SEVERAL NEW GALLERIES HAVE OPENED 
AND MORE ACTIVITY IS ON THE WAY.

War? What war? 
</P>
<P>
Recession? What recession? 
</P>
<P>
Despite ominous news on military and economic fronts, Los Angeles art galleries 
are gearing up for the biggest fall season ever. Amid a glut of exhibition 
openings -- the majority of them scheduled for this weekend -- several new 
galleries have opened and more activity is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five openings are scheduled for this week alone, up from 55 during the 
inaugural week of last year's fall season. New attractions opening Saturday 
include the Dorothy Goldeen Gallery's exhibition of paintings by David 
Wojnarowicz, who has been an outspoken critic of censorship in the ongoing 
controversy over government arts funding; new work by pioneering conceptualist 
Joseph Kosuth, at the Margo Leavin Gallery; and etchings by James Turrell, a 
leading figure of Light/Space art, at the Stuart Regen Gallery. About 50 
additional art exhibitions will open next week, and 24 member galleries of the 
Santa Monica/Venice Art Dealers Assn. will host an open house 6-9 p.m. on Sept. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica, the site of a gallery boom in the last four years, remains a 
stronghold for contemporary art galleries and a magnet for new ones. The Marc 
Richards Gallery, for example, has moved from Jefferson Boulevard into the back 
section of Krygier/Landau Contemporary Art, at 2114 Broadway. It's a 
money-saving move, but Richards and Krygier/Landau have not merged, the dealers 
emphasize, and they will not reduce their activity. The two galleries will 
conduct completely independent businesses, staging simultaneous exhibitions in 
separate galleries and alternating use of a central show space. 
</P>
<P>
Richards, who is looking forward to increased traffic on Broadway's gallery 
row, will open this weekend with a group exhibition, appropriately titled 
"Opening, Creating a Context." He plans to conduct "a wide, eclectic program" 
of exhibitions and continue the series of "Art Matters" symposiums that he 
began in his former gallery. Krygier/Landau's fall opening event is "D.E.M.: 
Accretion," a collaboration between CalArts graduates Erik Otsea and Jan Tumlir 
that features a painting the team has worked on continuously for more than two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherry Frumkin Gallery, also new on the Santa Monica scene, recently opened 
at 1440 9th St., in a building inaugurated in June by the Koplin Gallery, which 
relocated from West Hollywood. Frumkin's first solo show, opening today, 
features John Wilson's small sculptural scenarios, collectively titled "The 
Reagan Years Plus Two and Other Ethical Issues." Randye Sandel, James 
Strombotne and Ron Pippin are also on Frumkin's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
New York's Bess Cutler Gallery plans to open a Santa Monica branch in December, 
in conjunction with Los Angeles' fifth annual international art fair. The SoHo 
gallery, which represents emerging New York artists, will take over a 
6,000-square-foot warehouse on 9th Street, according to a gallery spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of the beach, clean air, easy parking and the company of other dealers 
continue to boost the population of Santa Monica's young community of 
galleries, but the seaside city isn't the only site of gallery action. 
</P>
<P>
Rosamund Felsen has ended her search for more space at 8525 Santa Monica Blvd., 
a few blocks north of her 12-year-old gallery on La Cienega Boulevard. Closing 
the space at 669 N. La Cienega Blvd. was a historic moment in Los Angeles art 
history, Felsen observed, because the building in West Hollywood has housed a 
notable sequence of dealers since the mid-'60s. The list includes Rolf Nelson, 
Paula Cooper, Eugenia Butler, Riko Mizuno, Larry Gagosian and Timothea Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Felsen's new home, due to open Oct. 6 with a show of Mike Kelley's work, also 
has a few historical credits. The 4,400-square-foot space (about twice as big 
as Felsen's old gallery) formerly housed the Tom Kelly photography studios, 
where some of Marilyn Monroe's calendar photographs were taken. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise of the season is the arrival of two galleries in Beverly 
Hills, which has been better known for glittering, commercial showcases along 
Rodeo Drive than for the more restrained, scholarly style that attracts the 
cognoscenti. "I wouldn't have taken a spot there (on Rodeo Drive) if the rent 
was free," said dealer Louis Stern. Instead, the Louis Stern Galleries opened 
around the corner, at 9528 Brighton Way, and packed in 200 people last week at 
a reception for the inaugural exhibition of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist 
and modern artworks. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, who has been affiliated with the Wally Findlay Galleries and worked as a 
private dealer in Los Angeles, said that there are "great contemporary 
galleries" here, but the area has had few places to see and buy Impressionist 
and modern art. After working with European galleries, Stern said he wanted to 
"integrate the quietly elegant sensibilities of a Paris gallery" into Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to get fine Impressionist and modern material," Stern 
said, but he is confident that collectors are interested. As for choosing 
Beverly Hills, Stern said his gallery was likely to attract a different 
audience than the contemporary galleries in Santa Monica, so it wouldn't be a 
great advantage to be near them. Tourist trade and Asian collectors who do 
business in Beverly Hills were other factors in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Stern will have prestigious company in Salander-O'Reilly, a major New York 
gallery that will open a West Coast branch at 456 N. Camden Drive, formerly 
occupied by Parachute, Inc. The first exhibition, a 1958-1990 retrospective of 
Kenneth Noland's paintings, will run from Oct. 9 to Nov. 17. The second event, 
from Nov. 20 to Dec. 29, will be one of five roughly simultaneous exhibitions 
of Jules Olitski's paintings planned for New York, Paris, London, Madrid and 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Gallery owner Larry Salander said the Beverly Hills exhibition program will 
parallel that of his Madison Avenue gallery. Exhibitions will generally feature 
major figures in contemporary art and catalogues will be published for the 
shows. Some exhibitions will open in Beverly Hills and others in New York, but 
most will be seen in both locations. 
</P>
<P>
"I am opening the gallery in Beverly Hills out of respect for people who are 
involved in art in Los Angeles. It's a very sophisticated place. Once I became 
aware of that, I thought I should act on it. I have no financial expectations, 
but it can't be a bad thing for us," Salander said. 
</P>
<P>
Why Beverly Hills? "I found a beautiful space, and that was my prime concern," 
he said. "I believe that when you put the right art up, people will come."

'SAIGON' IS UNDER FIRE ONCE MORE; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: VIETNAMESE-AMERICANS CHARGE THE HIT LONDON MUSICAL STEREOTYPES, 
DEMEANS THE VIETNAMESE.

<P>
The beleaguered production of "Miss Saigon" has come under new attack, this 
time from Vietnamese-Americans who charge that the hit London musical 
stereotypes and demeans the Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
"Again and again, Hollywood and the theatrical world have exploited the Vietnam 
War, and here we go again," said Chi-Muoi Lo, a Los Angeles actor and 
playwright who is organizing Vietnamese community protests against the play. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, where about 100,000 Vietnamese refugees have settled since 
1975, two Vietnamese-language newspapers have run editorials criticizing the 
play in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of "Miss Saigon" has largely focused on whether Caucasian actors 
should be cast in Asian and Eurasian roles. But in the past two weeks, several 
Vietnamese-Americans, including two newspaper editors and several actors and 
business people, have taken aim at the substance of the play itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter to us if in 'Miss Saigon' the role of the half-French, 
half-Vietnamese character (the Engineer) is given to Jonathan Pryce or to a 
Filipino or Chinese actor . . . ," Nguoi Viet columnist Bui Bao Truc wrote last 
week. "The image of the Vietnamese has already been distorted." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, these critics object to the main character, a bar girl who falls 
in love with and is deserted by an American GI. Lo and others charge that this 
reworking of the "Madame Butterfly" theme furthers the relentless stereotyping 
in Western books, movies and plays of Vietnamese women as bar girls, 
prostitutes or mama-san. 
</P>
<P>
"It is demeaning to the Asian community as a whole to have Asian women 
continually portrayed as prostitutes," said the 24-year-old Lo, whose credits 
include appearances on the TV show "China Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Lo also complained that the song "American Dream," in which the Eurasian 
engineer played by Jonathan Pryce sings of his desire to become an American, is 
demeaning in its implication that Asians would rather be white. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a racist play," Chinese-American playwright Frank Chin said earlier this 
week. Chin said the play implies that Asian women "crave white rescue, and the 
tragedy is that Miss Saigon chooses the wrong white rescuer -- but there she 
is, like Vietnam, supposedly, abandoned to fate, to the communists." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of lobbying to have Asian actors cast in the Asian roles, Chin said, 
Asian-American actors should boycott the production entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Thibodeau, a spokesman for "Saigon" producer Cameron Mackintosh in New 
York, said Tuesday that Mackintosh would have no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
However, Thibodeau said "Saigon's" characters are complex and multidimensional, 
and he released a letter written to Mackintosh by a British charity, which 
brought several Vietnamese war orphans to see the London production. The letter 
praised the show and said the refugees, now women in their early 20s, were 
deeply moved. 
</P>
<P>
Yen Do, editor of the Westminster-based daily Nguoi Viet, said the storm over 
"Miss Saigon" in the English-language media has rekindled longstanding 
complaints about Hollywood's treatment of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Many Vietnamese, including veterans of the South Vietnamese army, have 
complained that films such as "Platoon," "Born on the Fourth of July" and 
"Casualties of War" have reduced the Vietnamese characters to bit players in 
their own civil war. 
</P>
<P>
"Saigon" spokesman Thibodeau said Mackintosh would have no comment on any 
aspect of the show until after meeting with Actors' Equity later this week. 
Although the actor's union has reversed its controversial decision to bar Pryce 
from co-starring in the Broadway production, Mackintosh has said he wants more 
guarantees of artistic freedom before he agrees to bring the show to New York. 
Thibodeau declined to specify what kind of guarantees would be sought. 
</P>
<P>
"He's talking about the principle of artistic freedom as it applies to several 
issues in the show," Thibodeau said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Vietnamese criticisms, Thibodeau noted that the main character is a 
bar girl but not a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder how many of them have actually seen or read the play?" Thibodeau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The show portrays the Vietnamese characters in it as very multidimensional, 
very complex," he said. "Kim (the 'Miss Saigon' character) is an amazing person 
who sacrifices her whole life for her child. She's no two-dimensional 
stereotype." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from other Vietnamese-Americans was varied. 
</P>
<P>
Kieu Chinh, once the leading lady of Vietnamese cinema and now an actress in 
Los Angeles, said she would like to see a new angle on Asian women explored. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it is time to talk more about Vietnam than only soldiers and blood and 
barbed wire . . . ," she said. "I would like to talk about how war affects 
people, women and children and families, instead of presenting Vietnamese women 
to the world as bar girls who wear miniskirts and low-cut blouses . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing against that kind of story, but I wish that other stories would 
be told, too." 
</P>
<P>
Duc Au, a UC Irvine student and radio talk show host who has sharply criticized 
"Platoon," said he found nothing offensive in "Miss Saigon." He said 
traditional Vietnamese literature includes many stories in which a daughter 
sacrifices herself into prostitution to support her family. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be on the offensive only when something depicts us as shallow or is 
demeaning in some way," Au said. "But we shouldn't make a commotion about this 
one because we don't really have a case." 
</P>
<P>
Co Dang Long Pham, president of the Vietnamese-American Chamber of Commerce, 
said he does not object to the contents of "Miss Saigon" but is irritated by 
the absurdities that ensue when Vietnamese roles are played by other Asians or 
whites. Among the worst offenders, he said, are TV shows and movies in which 
purported Vietnamese characters begin mouthing Asian-sounding gibberish or 
speaking a language other than Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
"They should get as advisers real Vietnamese, so they could make movies like 
the real thing, not always to see things from the Caucasian point of view," 
Pham said. "Now Americans see these movies and they don't even know what real 
Vietnamese look like." 
</P>
<P>
Thibodeau said the producers of "Miss Saigon" had advertised in Nguoi Viet 
seeking Vietnamese actors in January and had spent three days auditioning 
candidates in Santa Ana and Los Angeles in preparation for the anticipated New 
York production. 
</P>
<P>
No casting decisions have been made, he said.

The Pacifica Foundation -- already embroiled in a controversy over restrictions 
on allegedly indecent radio programming -- is mulling rejection of $30,000 in 
National Endowment for the Arts grants to protest what it sees as a multifront 
federal censorship campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the dispute underscores what many NEA grantees have complained may be 
perceived as unanticipated far-reaching effects of a provision of the arts 
endowment's 1990 appropriation bill. That provision bars federal support to any 
arts project that is "obscene" and lacking in artistic merit. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Pacifica Foundation, the NEA has offered money to support a 
tape archives that includes some of the raciest early work of such people as 
Lenny Bruce and George Carlin -- dissemination of which might run afoul of the 
bitterly contested obscenity control clause. The NEA has required grant 
recipients to sign a certification they will comply with the anti-obscenity 
provisions of the money bill. 
</P>
<P>
The Berkeley-based foundation, also known as Pacifica Radio, operates six 
unconventional stations -- including KPFK-FM in Los Angeles -- in four states. 
The stations have been challenging increasing pressure from Congress and the 
Federal Communications Commission to restrict "offensive" or "off-color" 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica has often taken on Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), author of a 1988 
amendment that requires the FCC to crack down on "indecent" broadcasts. The 
amendment requires the FCC to aggressively ban "indecent" material. 
</P>
<P>
Little known in the course of the FCC dispute, however, has been Pacifica's 
status as an ongoing recipient of NEA funds -- though the arts endowment 
support is not directly involved in Pacifica's programming over KPFK, KPFA and 
KPFB in Berkeley, WBAI in New York City, KPFT in Houston and WPFW in 
Washington. The foundation also operates Pacifica Radio News, a network with 40 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
This year, according to David Salniker, Pacifica's executive director, the NEA 
offered the parent Pacifica Foundation a $20,000 grant for ongoing support of 
the Los Angeles-based Pacifica Radio Archives, which maintains a library of 
more than 40,000 documentary tapes. An NEA award of $10,000 was also received 
for a Berkeley-based program that trains women and minority group members in 
the technical aspects of radio production. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview earlier this week, Salniker said that, while the 
grants may first seem inconsequential in the context of Pacifica's $4.5-million 
annual budget, the foundation had become alarmed at the possible implications 
of NEA funding restrictions for the archives, in particular. The collection 
includes tapes of interviews and other materials involving political 
controversies beginning with the McCarthy era. 
</P>
<P>
The tape collection, Salniker said, also includes largely unexpurgated 
interviews with counterculture stalwarts including poet Allen Ginsberg, 
novelist Jack Kerouac and radical political leaders Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, 
Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton. 
</P>
<P>
Salniker said the Pacifica Foundation's executive committee discussed the NEA 
grant dilemma in early August and recommended to the foundation's full board 
that the two NEA grants be rejected as a protest to the NEA policy requiring 
grantees to acknowledge the restrictive provisions of the money bill in writing 
before their grants may be paid. The full board will take up the issue in early 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Salniker said, Pacifica got involved last year in ongoing attempts 
to try to set aside the FCC restrictions also authored by Helms. When the NEA 
obscenity oath controversy broke out earlier this year, he said, the situation 
struck Pacifica as not an isolated problem, but part of a broader-brush 
censorship fight of which the FCC component had simply been the first shot 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a consensus within the organization," Salniker said, "that these 
restrictions are an abhorrent attack on cultural freedom."

MORNING REPORT: M.C'S HAMMERLOCK ON 1ST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

international news services and the nation's press.

<P>
The only people being hurt by M. C. Hammer's "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em" are 
competitors who've been trying to slip into the No. 1 position on the Billboard 
pop album chart. With 14 weeks as pop-chart champ, Hammer continues his lock on 
the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to say who'll unseat Hammer. Prince's "Graffiti Bridge," at No. 10, 
is the hottest new album around. Other hot albums -- all somewhere in the 
hard-rock genre: Jane's Addiction's "Ritual de lo Habitual" (No. 19), Anthrax's 
"Persistence of Time" (No. 26), Ratt's "Detonator" (No. 33) and Stryper's 
"Against the Law" (No. 39). Wilson Phillips has another No. 1 single with 
"Release Me." 
</P>
<P>
* Living Colour, the black rock band that initially had a tough time finding an 
audience, may be on the verge of superstardom. Its "Time's Up" debuted at No. 
82 but could jump into the Top 20 next week.

HOME TECH / VIDEO: 'TOTAL RECALL' WILL AIM FOR CHRISTMAS MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Total Recall," the summer's biggest-grossing action movie, will be out on 
cassette Nov. 1 -- just five months after its theatrical release. Priced at 
$24.99, the sci-fi adventure film, which stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, is being 
rushed to the home-video market to make it available to shoppers during the 
Christmas gift-buying season. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement from LIVE Home Video was somewhat of a surprise considering 
that the fall schedule for low-priced, sales-market titles is already full and 
includes blockbusters such as "Peter Pan," "Pretty Woman" and "Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry skeptics are saying that many video retailers won't have enough 
money to stock up on all these titles. 
</P>
<P>
But Stuart Snyder, vice president of marketing at LIVE, disputes that notion. 
"Retailers aren't stupid," he said. "They've learned how to set up their 
budgets to buy what they need, particularly since they have a lot of time to 
plan. The fall movies were all announced early enough for them to make the 
necessary plans." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he noted, these particular films can coexist more easily than other 
possible competitors because they're aimed at different audiences. "Peter Pan," 
"All Dogs Go to Heaven," "The Jetsons" and "Ninja Turtles" are for kids, he 
said, while "Total Recall" is targeted for young men and "Pretty Woman" has 
much stronger appeal to females. 
</P>
<P>
"Total Recall" is facing another obstacle in aiming for the sales rather than 
rental market. Movies priced in the $20-$25 range are generally family films, 
or at least are low in sex and violence. The R-rated "Total Recall" -- 
criticized by some for excessive violence -- doesn't seem to fit these 
qualifications. But Snyder said that the company was convinced otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"According to our research, people indicated a strong interest in buying 'Total 
Recall' -- strong enough for us to price it for that market," he explained. 
"Also, the research shows it does have high repeatability. Some people will 
want to own it so they can watch it many times." 
</P>
<P>
But mass merchants such as Target and K mart, who move most of the cassettes in 
the under-$25 category, usually carry family-oriented videos and tend to shy 
away from anything R-rated. Warner's "Lethal Weapon 2," R-rated for sex and 
violence, suffered earlier this year in the mass-merchant market. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE did its homework there too, Snyder said: "Before we decided on pricing 
'Total Recall' for the sell-through market, we conferred with mass merchants 
and various big outlets that might have a problem stocking an R-rated movie. We 
were assured there would be no problem. They look at the situation title by 
title. This is the kind of R-rated movie they would carry." 
</P>
<P>
Discussions about placing a commercial on the "Total Recall" cassettes are 
taking place but a final decision has not yet been reached, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING CLASSICS: Many classic movies are languishing in home-video vaults 
because it doesn't pay to release them. When released at a retail price of 
around $20, the profit margins are so slim that there is generally little or no 
room to pay for a marketing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
MCA/Universal, however, came up with a relatively low-cost plan to boost sales 
of "Harvey," a 1950 comedy starring James Stewart, which sells for $19.95. 
Label executive Jane Ayer dreamed up the idea of adding a six-minute 
introduction to the tape, featuring a narrative by Stewart and rare stills from 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't cost that much to do the intro," Ayer said. "We were able to sell so 
many more copies that the expense was worth it. What that intro did was give 
the media a hook -- something to write about and something for TV features. 
They did interviews with James Stewart, who was a big help in marketing the 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
Ayer wouldn't reveal figures but insisted that, because of the introduction, 
"Harvey" sales are much higher than they would have been otherwise. "Harvey," a 
May release, made it to the Top Five of the Billboard magazine sales chart -- a 
remarkable achievement for a 40-year-old movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the intro, it would have been perceived as just another old movie and 
it would have gotten lost in the shuffle," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Adding narratives may be new to home video but, for some time, they've been 
used as a marketing tool for laser-disc movies. Stewart did something similar a 
few years ago for the laser-disc version "Winchester '73." 
</P>
<P>
Ayer said that, for now, MCA/Universal has no plans to release any other movies 
with such an intro. "This wouldn't work for just any old movie," she said. "You 
need the right movie and the right star."

PLANS TO FUND 20 GROUPS RECOMMENDED; 
</P>
<P>
GRANTS: THE NEWPORT HARBOR ART MUSEUM WOULD TAKE THE DEEPEST CUT OF ANY LOCAL 
INSTITUTION UNDER RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty Orange County groups would receive 1990-91 state funding under 
recommendations released this week by the California Arts Council. At the same 
time, council staff has suggested a funding probation of sorts for the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum because of vacancies in top administrative and artistic 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
All groups are recommended for two grant amounts in an effort to address the 
fact that more groups are seeking slices of an Organizational Support Program 
pie that has remained the same size, said Terezita Romo, the program's manager. 
</P>
<P>
Under one recommendation (Study One in accompanying chart), the Orange County 
groups would receive a total of $278,978. Under the other (Study Two), they 
would receive $270,733. The council is expected to approve one of the 
recommendations at regular meetings in Sacramento next week. 
</P>
<P>
The council's Organizational Support Program awards grants from two separate 
pots of money: one for small and mid-size groups with budgets under $1 million, 
the other for large groups with budgets of $1 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, however, the smaller groups are harder hit by limited funds in the 
program's total budget because there are many more of them. Large groups must 
meet more rigorous standards and requirements to qualify for grants. 
</P>
<P>
This year, for instance, 623 small and mid-size groups are recommended for 
grants, contrasted with 564 last year. In contrast, 36 large groups are 
recommended for funding, only two more than last year. Grant budgets remained 
the same this year, however: $3.8 million for smaller groups and $3.1 million 
for larger ones. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, in order to "equalize the pain" of limited overall funds, the 
council requested a second plan, under which money for the two grant programs 
would be pooled. Money would then be distributed to groups in both categories 
in amounts that would be reduced "across the board . . . by the same 
percentage," Romo said. In effect, money would be taken from the large-budget 
groups to provide modest increases in grant amounts to the smaller 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of which recommendation is followed, five Orange County arts groups 
were recommended for larger grants than they received last year and eight were 
recommended for lesser amounts. (The remaining seven did not apply last year.) 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum would take the deepest cut of any local 
institution and was recommended for "conditional funding" because of lowered 
ranks it received from council advisory panels. 
</P>
<P>
The panels assign ranks on a scale of 1 to 4, the highest, after evaluating 
groups' artistic and managerial strength and community outreach. Ranks, along 
with institutions' budgets, determine grant size. Historically, only groups 
ranked 3- and above are funded. But in order to give some slack to the state's 
most prominent, well-established groups, the council provides conditional 
funding for those that fail the mark. 
</P>
<P>
For the Newport Harbor Art Museum, which was ranked 3- for artistic and 
managerial integrity and 2 for community outreach, that would mean a greatly 
reduced grant over last year's -- either $9,538 or $9,390, contrasted with 
$59,386 in 1989. The museum would also have to submit to council staff a 
quarterly update on its finances and art programs and be visited by council 
staff and a council member, among other measures, Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole point of conditional funding is that the council wants the 
organization to have a year to bring its rank back up above a 3-," Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
Panelists judging the museum's outreach efforts cited the loss of director 
Kevin E. Consey and chief curator Paul Schimmel before lowering its score from 
a 3+ to a 2. Neither position has been filled. Consey left nearly a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Panel comments made available this week stated that the lack of both leaders, 
and the fact that the museum is "in the middle of a building campaign" (now 
stalled until a new director is hired) robbed panelists of the "confidence that 
the proposed outreach plans would go forward." 
</P>
<P>
Other comments contributing to the equally dramatic drop in artistic and 
managerial rank from 4- to 3 stressed that the museum's board and staff need 
broader ethnic representation.

+Study 1 is recommended if the council follows its tradition of using separate 
budgets to distribute organizational grants to small and mid-size groups and 
large groups. Study 2 is recommended if the two budgets are lumped together to 
equalize the impact of a limited budget on small and mid-size groups, which 
greatly outnumber large groups. 
</P>
<P>
++Rankings: Candidates for grants are ranked on a 1-4 scale, with a 4 at the 
top. Organizations with budgets of $1 million or more are given two scores and 
therefore greater scrutiny -- because they receive the largest grants. The 
first rank on this chart is for artistic and managerial strength, the second is 
for community outreach.

A CARTOON 'OZ' FOR SATURDAY TV; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: CHILDREN'S SERIES WILL BE BASED ON THE MGM MOVIE. STORY LINES WILL 
BE ORIGINAL.

<P>
A beloved icon of pop culture will join the Saturday morning TV 'toon lineup 
this week: an animated series for ABC based on the MGM film "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
How do you repackage a classic without offending fans, and at the same time 
attract young viewers avid for the high-tech antics of "Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles"? 
</P>
<P>
Very carefully, say its creators at DIC Enterprises Inc. "The Wizard of Oz" 
debuts Saturday at 7:30 a.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. 
</P>
<P>
"We all felt a great sense of responsibility," said DIC president Andy Heyward. 
"We felt that we were dealing with something that was almost sacred -- not 
based on toy products or something transitory, but one of the treasures of 
American film." 
</P>
<P>
He said that there were three possible routes the company could have taken in 
adapting the 1939 film to a cartoon series: "We could go to the body of work 
written by ("Oz" creator L. Frank) Baum and not used in the movie, or go to 
public domain; many of Baum's works are in the public domain now. Third, the 
only way we felt made sense, would be to use the characters and story line from 
the movie as a starting point." 
</P>
<P>
Each cartoon will be a variation on the movie's quest theme, beginning with the 
first episode, in which Dorothy is summoned back to Oz to help her friends. The 
Wicked Witch of the West, brought back to life by her evil monkeys, has taken 
over the Emerald City, put a spell on the Wizard and stolen the Tin Man's 
heart, the Lion's medal and the Scarecrow's diploma. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirteen episodes take them all through Oz," said Mike Maliani, a DIC producer 
and vice president of development. "They're in Munchkin village, then Fort 
Nutcracker with wooden soldiers, Pop Land, full of jack-in-the-boxes; 
Mechanica, where everybody is mechanical -- they get caught up in all kinds of 
adventures as they're trying to find the Wizard. 
</P>
<P>
The film's memorable music will be heard, without the original voices and with 
some lyric changes: "We're off to see the wizard" becomes "We're off to save 
the wizard," for instance. The characterizations of the Scarecrow, Tin Man and 
the rest will be familiar, although animating a legend has been assiduously 
avoided -- Dorothy does not resemble Judy Garland. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we kept the integrity of the classic and mixed in enough new for 
today's audience," Maliani said. "Kids would be instantly turned off to see 
something old." 
</P>
<P>
The "new" includes "weird designs, lots of eye candy, vivid colors and updated 
references," Maliani said. "We changed Dorothy's look, made her look more like 
(Disney's) 'Little Mermaid' -- that type of design." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of an "Oz" cartoon series is far from new, according to Robby London, 
DIC's senior vice president of creative affairs. The difference this time was 
that instead of going after rights to the books, DIC acquired the rights to the 
movie -- obtaining them from MGM library owner Ted Turner, with whom the 
company is co-producing a new syndicated cartoon series, "Captain Planet." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Oz' has been pitched and pitched to networks every year," he said. "But what 
kids really know about it is the movie. I read the books as a child, but what I 
remember is Margaret Hamilton as the witch, and those songs. Most broadcasters 
realized that and it's one reason 'Oz' has not been previously seen on Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, what's 'Oz' without the ruby slippers? You can't use them 
without the rights to the movie." In Baum's book, the slippers are silver. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think kids will be disappointed," said Jennie Trias, vice president of 
children's programming at ABC. "They'll see the Witch . . . , the Munchkins, 
the Wizard -- everything they remember, at least characterwise."

JUDY COLLINS WILL SOLO AT IRVINE BARCLAY THEATRE

<P>
Judy Collins has been signed for a solo show at the Irvine Barclay Theatre on 
Oct. 9, a theater spokesperson said Thursday, which will make her the first 
nationally known performer to appear there. 
</P>
<P>
The $17.6-million theater is to be launched with speeches by local dignitaries 
and a brief ceremony Sept. 30, after which the 750-seat auditorium will be 
thrown open to the public for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The facility is owned by the city of Irvine, UC Irvine and the theater's 
nonprofit operating company. 
</P>
<P>
The first performance of any kind will be given Oct. 7 by the South Coast 
Symphony in what officials consider "an acoustic tuneup" for the hall. After 
Collins' show, the National Theatre of the Deaf will stage a production Oct. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
Concluding the first week of festivities, on Oct. 12 a "Trustees' Gala" to 
raise funds (at $250 to $300 a ticket) will feature five veteran Broadway 
performers doing numbers from the musicals for which they won Tony Awards: Gene 
Barry ("La Cage aux Folles"), who will also host the benefit; John Cullum 
("Shenandoah"); Donna McKechnie ("A Chorus Line"); Michael Maguire ("Les 
Miserables") and Judy Kaye ("The Phantom of the Opera"). JAN HERMAN

PART OF LA HABRA BLACKED OUT

<P>
A construction crew working at the La Habra Fashion Square damaged a power line 
this morning, causing a 45-minute blackout that affected a local hospital and 
an unknown number of stores and homes in a half-mile-square area of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency generators at the Friendly Hills Medical Center on Lambert Road were 
automatically activated after the 9:15 a.m. power failure. 
</P>
<P>
No patients were in danger, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra police spokeswoman Cindy Knapp said the blackout also knocked out 
traffic signals at four major intersections, and police directed traffic until 
power returned about 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The power failure was limited to an area bounded by Beach Boulevard on the 
west, Lambert Road on the north, Idaho Street on the east and Imperial Highway 
on the south, Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
Police think a heavy-equipment operator at the Fashion Square mall, which is 
being renovated, inadvertently cut a power line, Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
Edison spokesman Bob Goodlow could not confirm the cause of the outage, saying 
only that investigators for the utility company were at the scene gathering 
information. 
</P>
<P>
An operator at the local Bullocks, the only store still operating at the 
shopping center, said that the store did not lose power and was opened without 
any delays.

<TEXT>
<P>
One man was killed and two others were seriously injured today when a speeding 
car veered out of control on the Hollywood Freeway in Studio City and crashed 
into a barrier wall, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Officer John Lessentiv said the accident occurred about 2:30 a.m. in the 
northbound lanes of the Hollywood Freeway near the Lankershim Boulevard exit. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the 18-year-old Hollywood man who was killed in the crash was not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was driving an estimated 100 m.p.h. when he lost control of the 
vehicle and hit the center median of the freeway, Lessentiv said. The car then 
rebounded across all the northbound lanes of the freeway, went up an embankment 
and hit a light pole and barrier wall. The car then overturned and the driver 
and two passengers were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers Carlos A. Juarez, 23, of Hollywood and a 17-year-old Hollywood boy 
whose name was not released suffered serious injuries and were being treated at 
St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, Lessentiv said.

British historian A. J .P. Taylor, whose accounts of modern European life and 
politics became both bestsellers and schoolroom classics, died today, his 
daughter said. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
He had spent the last two years in a London nursing home after developing 
Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Alan John Percivale Taylor was one of Europe's leading authorities on the great 
conflicts of the 20th Century. He was credited with making history interesting 
for the public as an author, journalist and television lecturer. 
</P>
<P>
A. J. P. Taylor -- the name by which he was known to the world -- won acclaim 
for the insights he gave into the events that shaped modern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Generations of British students have struggled through their history 
examinations with his books. Many were translated into other languages and sold 
millions of copies in paperback, becoming standard textbooks worldwide.

Three leftist radicals pleaded guilty today to bombing the U.S. Capitol in 1983 
and conspiring to set off explosions at eight locations as part of a campaign 
of "armed propaganda" to protest U.S. policies in Grenada and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn J. Buck, 42; Linda S. Evans, 43, and Laura J. Whitehorn, 45, pleaded 
guilty to conspiracy and causing malicious damage to a government building. 
</P>
<P>
The charges carry a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The three women pleaded guilty to conspiring to set off bombs at the Capitol 
and seven other locations in New York and Washington. They also admitted 
detonating a bomb that blew a hole in a wall outside the U.S. Senate chamber 
late on Nov. 7, 1983. No one was injured in any of the incidents.

More than 250,000 adolescents, mostly boys, have used steroids to build muscles 
and enhance athletic performance at the risk of physical and psychological 
harm, federal health officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
This non-medical use of anabolic steroids is illegal, but the number of 
teen-agers using them is believed to be growing, according to a report by the 
Department of Health and Human Services inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
The report recommended that the department develop a national educational 
program to increase awareness of the hazards of steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very concerned that some adults who are charged with our young people's 
welfare might be passively accepting or even tacitly approving the use of these 
dangerous drugs," HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan in a statement released with 
the report.

The nuns of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity gathered today to elect a 
successor to "a saint." 
</P>
<P>
Pleading old age and ill health, Mother Teresa is stepping down as head of her 
order two weeks after her 80th birthday and a year after she suffered a 
near-fatal heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II, who had rejected her earlier pleas to step aside, accepted 
her resignation last March. 
</P>
<P>
Her successor is expected to be one of the six nuns who serve on the council 
administering the order, which operate 430 homes in 95 countries under the 
mission to "help the poorest of the poor" -- lepers, the severely handicapped 
and maimed and abandoned infants. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 nuns are expected to cast secret ballots Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The order's new superior general will be announced at the Vatican after the 
Pope approves the decision.

CHINESE DISMISS PREMIER LI PENG FROM KEY POST

Chinese Premier Li Peng was dropped today from a key government post overseeing 
the country's stalled economic reform program. 
</P>
<P>
State-run media said the standing committee of the National People's Congress 
appointed a little-known former Shanghai politician and business executive to 
replace Li as minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Beijing and China Central Broadcasting said Li's replacement is Chen 
Jinhua, 61. The China News Service said Chen was a "longtime leader in economic 
work" who had been president of the China National Petrochemical Corp. since 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
Li took charge of the commission in 1988, the same year he became premier. 
</P>
<P>
The China News Service said Li asked to be relieved in order to concentrate on 
his duties as premier. But Li has been criticized for his strict economic 
policies and his role in the 1989 crackdown on the nation's pro-democracy 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Li's austerity program has reduced inflation, which peaked at about 40% in 
1988. But the economic measures have also brought the nation to the brink of 
recession and forced millions of small factories to close. 
</P>
<P>
The program also halted many market-oriented reforms and returned much of the 
economic decision-making power to the central government. Local and provincial 
governments had gained a greater say in economic affairs during the last 
decade.

A Cook County judge today denied for the second time a father's request to have 
his 3 1/2-year-old twins tested as possible bone marrow donors for his dying 
12-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit Judge Monica Reynolds said she cannot order the tests because the 
twins, James and Allison Curran, would derive no physical benefit. 
</P>
<P>
The twins' mother, Nancy Curran, opposes the tests, so their father, Tamas 
Bosze, sued to force the twins to undergo testing in a bid to help his son, 
Jean-Pierre, who is dying of leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre has called the twins his last hope for survival, although now his 
condition is too poor for a transplant to be performed. 
</P>
<P>
Curran, whose relationship with Bosze ended when she was eight months pregnant, 
objected to the procedure, saying she feared for the health and safety of her 
children. Jean-Pierre is Bosze's son by another woman. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds' first ruled against the tests July 18 and Bosze won an emergency 
appeal before the Supreme Court. The high court found the interests of the 
three children had not been adequately represented independent of their 
parents' interests and ordered guardians appointed and the case reheard.

The British government today quashed days of sometimes frenzied market 
speculation that the pound would finally join the European Community's exchange 
rate mechanism this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's finance minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, said in a 
radio interview that while Britain fully intends to join the ERM, it will do so 
only when its previously stated conditions for entry have been met. 
</P>
<P>
"Not this weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ERM is a feature of the European Monetary System. It limits the amount that 
European currencies can fluctuate against each other and is seen as a 
stabilizing influence. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has repeatedly ruled out the pound's entry 
into the ERM until British inflation can be brought into line with that of 
other major Western European countries.

Champagne grape prices for the 1990 harvest have been set 20% higher after a 
30-year-old accord between growers and producers fell apart earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Champagne Producers Bureau, based in Epernay, said in a statement today 
that a reference grape price for this year's harvest, beginning Monday, has 
been fixed at $6.10 per 2.2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
This year is the first time the Champagne region's grape growers and houses 
that produce the famous sparkling wine have negotiated a free market price. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a 30-year-old system of fixing a six-year fixed price for 
Champagne grapes fell apart under pressure from growers keen to cash on in 
rapid growth worldwide in Champagne consumption.

The United States today announced a $4.7-billion sale of fighter jets and 
engines to South Korea under which Seoul will buy and co-produce 120 McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. FA-18 jets. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, which also includes General Electric jet engines, has been under 
consideration for two years. 
</P>
<P>
It is a major victory for McDonnell Douglas after its jet was chosen by Korea 
over the F-16 built by General Dynamics Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said the deal will be worth at least $3.2 billion to McDonnell 
Douglas, with about $500 million going to General Electric for 24 F-404 spare 
engines and other equipment. Commercial contracts for assembly and other items 
will bring the total to $4.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said the Bush Administration informed Congress of the deal late 
Thursday. It is expected to become official in 30 days without objection from 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, South Korea will buy 12 FA-18s, which are designed to battle 
other fighter aircraft and to attack ground targets. Another 36 aircraft kits 
will be shipped to South Korea for assembly, and the final 72 planes will be 
built under license in Korea using U.S.-made components. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said South Korea will buy and produce the jets over a period of 
several years to modernize and strengthen its armed forces. They will replace 
aging U.S.-built F-4 and F-5 aircraft used by the South Korean air force.

CANDIDATES OVERCHARGED FOR RADIO-TV TIME;

<P>
POLITICS: A SURPRISE FCC AUDIT OF 30 STATIONS FINDS WIDESPREAD VIOLATIONS OF 
THE LAW. EDUCATION EFFORTS ARE SLATED.

A surprise audit of 30 radio and TV stations found widespread overcharging of 
political candidates for advertising, a Federal Communications Commission 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
However, the official, Roy Stewart, said the commission will not levy sanctions 
against the stations at this time. Instead, the commission will increase its 
efforts to educate station executives in the intricacies of the political 
advertising laws, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, chief of the FCC's mass media bureau, said sanctions are possible 
after the bureau further investigates the 30 stations. He said no more audits 
are planned at this time. 
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of the July 16 audit was "to assist" broadcasters in 
complying with the law, which was passed in 1972. He would not characterize the 
violations as deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer to think they (broadcasters) are not aware of their full range 
of responsibilities . . . in carrying out the law," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
He did not identify which of the audited stations were in violation. 
</P>
<P>
The audit reviewed the stations' compliance with federal rules requiring that 
candidates have equal opportunities -- commonly referred to as equal time -- to 
appear on stations and whether stations are selling ads to candidates at the 
lowest rates for specific time slots. 
</P>
<P>
The audit found widespread overcharging at 16 of 20 TV stations audited. During 
a particular time at one of the stations, candidates paid $5,500 for a 
30-second ad, while commercial advertisers paid no more than $3,000 for a 
30-second spot. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau said broadcasters' "sales techniques encouraged (candidates) to buy 
higher-priced classes of time." 
</P>
<P>
The audit also found that many stations were not keeping good enough records to 
allow candidates to ascertain whether they should be getting equal time with 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The inspections -- the first of their kind -- were carried out in Cincinnati, 
Dallas-Ft. Worth, Philadelphia, Portland, Ore., and San Francisco. The 
commission said the stations were chosen because of their diverse locations and 
because they serve large areas. 
</P>
<P>
The commission in April fined an Indianapolis television station, WXIN, $10,000 
for violating the political ad rules.

Gene Murphy makes no bones about it. Cal State Fullerton is visiting 
third-ranked Auburn on Saturday for the money. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely a money game, not only for our football program but for the 
athletic program as a whole," said Murphy, whose team will receive a reported 
$250,000 to serve as Auburn's opening-day patsy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something we have to do to exist. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're not just coming down to Auburn to pick up a guaranteed check. We're 
coming down to become a better football team. We're going to play every snap 
and every down the best we can. Whether or not that's realistic, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Especially when the Titans lost three valuable players in their season-opening 
38-24 victory over Division II Sonoma State last week. Starting tailback Deon 
Thomas injured a knee in the second quarter and is lost for the season. Wide 
receiver Kerry Reed and offensive guard Shannon Illingworth also suffered 
injuries that will keep them out of the lineup for several weeks.

The Rams announced today that they have activated linebacker Kevin Greene, 
defensive tackle Doug Reed and safety Michael Stewart for Sunday's game at 
Green Bay against the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
The three players signed contracts with the Rams last weekend. Because they 
signed so late, the Rams received a two-week roster exemption from the NFL for 
them, but have decided not to use it. 
</P>
<P>
To make room for the trio on their roster, the Rams placed rookie wide receiver 
Tony Lomack and running back Jim Price on injured reserve. Both have hamstring 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had an open spot on their roster before making transactions, meaning 
they had to move only two players to make way for Greene, Reed and Stewart.

<P>
Leroy Burrell completed a perfect IAAF Grand Prix season in the 100 meters 
today, beating world record-holder Carl Lewis for the second consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell, out of the blocks quickly, was timed in 10.04 seconds in the Grand 
Prix final. It was his eighth victory on the international track and field 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, the two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 100, finished third in 10.12, 
a tick behind Mark Witherspoon, the runner-up in 10.11. The first three 
finishers are teammates on the Santa Monica Track Club. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell's victory gave him the Grand Prix 100-meter title, worth $10,000, and 
the men's overall title, worth $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Burrell, who has the year's best time -- 9.96 -- did not threaten Lewis' 
world record of 9.92 today. 
</P>
<P>
"My target was to win and I did," Burrell said. "It was a very good race. . . . 
I was tired because I had a lot of races this year." 
</P>
<P>
In their only other meeting this season, Burrell beat Lewis in the Goodwill 
Games at Seattle in July. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing went wrong," Lewis said. "Burrell did his job. I expected to have a 
better start." 
</P>
<P>
Jamaica's Merlene Ottey, winner of the 200 meters in 21.88, also earned $35,000 
-- $10,000 for being the women's 200 champion and $25,000 for being the overall 
women's champion. 
</P>
<P>
Ottey also won both titles in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell and Ottey each finished the season with 63 Grand Prix points. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise, Zambia's Samuel Matete edged American Danny Harris in the 
400-meter intermediate hurdles. Matete posted a career best of 47.91. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, the 1984 Olympic silver medalist and the first hurdler to break 48 
seconds eight times in one season, finished second in 47.93. 
</P>
<P>
Harris ran the season's best time of 47.49 at Lausanne, Switzerland, in July 
and until today was unbeaten in 13 races this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to beat Harris," Matete said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya's William Tanui won the 800 meters in 1:44.95, with Algerian Reda 
Abdenouz second in 1:45.17 and Kenyan Nixon Kiprotich third in 1:45.17.

Ruhlmann and Lively One, a pair of handicap stars in the Charlie Whittingham 
stable, come off brief freshening periods to head the lineup in the 
$200,000-added Del Mar Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap at 1 mile Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The purse includes $100,000 from the Breeders' Cup fund for eligible horses. 
</P>
<P>
The speedy Ruhlmann highlighted his career with a victory in the $1-million 
Santa Anita Handicap in March. The 5-year-old son of Mr. Leader has won 10 of 
25 starts and earned $1,789,353. His last start was a fifth-place finish in the 
Hollywood Gold Cup on June 24. He will be ridden by Gary Stevens under high 
weight of 123 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lively One, a 5-year-old son of Halo, will be making his third start in the Del 
Mar Budweiser Breeders' Cup. He finished a close second to Precisionist in 1988 
and third last year. Winner of eight of 31 starts, Lively One captured the San 
Diego and Cabrillo Handicaps at Del Mar last year and has earned $1,192,300. He 
has been idle since a third-place finish in the Mervyn Leroy Handicap in May. 
Alex Solis has the call with 121 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Other probable starters include Jack Kent Cooke's Flying Continental and Sidney 
Factor's Stalwart Charger. Flying Continental, a son of Flying Paster, captured 
the Charles H. Strub Stakes in February and will carry 120. Corey Black has the 
call. California Derby winner Stalwart Charger will be ridden by Roberto 
Gonzalez and carry 115 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar will present the 35th running of the Osunitas Handicap on the lawn as 
the featured attraction of its final Saturday card of 1990. The 1 1/16-mile 
test for fillies and mares has drawn a field of 11 headed by Daring Doone, 
winner of more than $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
Daring Doone will carry top weight of 119 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Behind her in the weights at 118 pounds comes the trio of Paper Princess, 
Tessla and Sonilla. Others entered are Decora, Girl of France, Annual Reunion, 
Wedding Bouquet, Beata and Kikala.

<TEXT>
<P>
The preseries favorites for the American Pacing Classic, T.K.'s Skipper and 
Keystone Raider, are having problems getting to California for the Los Alamitos 
event because the crisis in the Middle East has upset flight plans. 
</P>
<P>
T.K.'s Skipper, the fastest aged pacer of all time, has been unable to leave 
the Chicago area because his plane was commandeered for the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran 5-year-old, which has earned more than half a million dollars 
lifetime, now will be taken by van to Lexington, Ky. From there T.K.'s Skipper 
will fly to Los Angeles and is expected in town next Wednesday. He will be 
entered in the $35,000 second leg of the American Pacing Classic, which will be 
run Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Keystone Raider, winner of the $148,000 American National Pace at Sportsman's 
Park in Chicago on Sept. 1, has also had his flight plans altered by the Middle 
East crisis as his cargo plane was commandeered. Travel plans are still 
pending, but Keystone Raider is expected to compete in the second leg of the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
The American Pacing Classic makes its return to California after a nine-year 
absence with Joseph C. Alflen's Dare You To topping the field of eight set to 
face the starter in the $35,000 first leg of the series Saturday night. First 
post time Saturday night will be 7:40 p.m.

MIAMI VS. BYU: DUEL OF HEISMAN HOPEFULS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Miami opens defense of its national championship Saturday in Provo, Utah, 
against the preseason favorite for the Heisman Trophy -- Brigham Young's Ty 
Detmer -- in what could be one of the better TV games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Miami safety Darryl Williams admits that Detmer "is pretty good" but goes on to 
say: "But he's a long way from being great. A long way. I want him to prove how 
good he is." 
</P>
<P>
In quarterback Craig Erickson, Miami has a Heisman Trophy candidate of its own. 
The Erickson-Detmer duel begins at 4:30 p.m. Saturday on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the teams ended the regular season in Miami with a 41-17 
Hurricanes' victory, and in a reserve role as a freshman, Detmer was 
intercepted three times and fumbled at the goal line in a 16-for-27, 212-yard, 
two-touchdown effort. 
</P>
<P>
CAVS' BIG CHANCE -- Virginia gets its chance Saturday to show it belongs in the 
high-rent district of the Top 10. The Cavaliers play host to Clemson, seeking 
their first-ever victory over the Tigers in 30 tries, in what is being called 
the biggest game in Virginia football history. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they could have sold 70,000 tickets for the game in 42,000-seat 
Scott Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Fact is, 14th-ranked Virginia does not have another powerful team on its 
schedule (Navy, Duke, William and Mary, North Carolina State, Wake Forest, 
Georgia Tech, North Carolina, Maryland and Virginia Tech), and a triumph over 
No. 9 Clemson would set up the Cavs as a strong candidate for the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
ENTANGLED IN HIS OWN WEBB -- Among the ramifications of Tennessee running back 
Chuck Webb's season-ending knee surgery is that he will probably not be able to 
turn pro after this season, which he was considering. That means he'll have to 
go to college for another year and a half while rehabilitating his knee, then 
attempt to prove in 1991 that he's back to his old self. 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, he admitted that a shot at pro football was what was keeping 
him in school. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't lie to you and say I like going to college," he told reporters. "I 
don't wake up with a smile on my face saying, 'I get to go to English class.' " 
</P>
<P>
BRUINS IN HIDING -- UCLA coach Terry Donahue has closed practice lately, saying 
injuries to his defense have forced the Bruins to make some schematic changes 
in preparation for the season opener Saturday against No. 23 Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Rocen Keeton is out for a month with a knee injury and the other 
starting defensive end, Mike Chalenski, has been practicing sporadically 
because his bad shoulder keeps popping out of place. 
</P>
<P>
NOTABLE -- After a seven-year hiatus from the depths of winless despair, 
Northwestern returned to its roots in 1989 with an 0-11 season and enters 1990 
with a 12-game losing streak -- second longest in the nation among Division 1-A 
schools, trailing only New Mexico State's 18.

IF YOU were a mouse in the RCA Building (now called by some the General 
Electric Building), you'd get to sneak in and see the a-building set for the 
"Today" show. 
</P>
<P>
(You know what they say when shows get into ratings troubles: "Let's just build 
a new set, and that will fix it.") 
</P>
<P>
There it is -- mostly shining wood and big mirrors, but with outlines of real, 
honest-to-goodness marble set into the floors, and inlaid parquet as far as the 
eye can see. (Does the viewing audience ever see a TV floor?) Looks like a fun 
place to be in the future with Bryant and Joe and Willard and Deborah (or 
whomever). 
</P>
<P>
CONSTANT READERS are familiar with the street-smart private detective known 
only as Burke in the novels of Andrew Vachss, books such as "Blue Belle," "Hard 
Candy" and "Blossom." 
</P>
<P>
Now Vachss has reached an agreement with David Picker and Paramount Pictures to 
produce a series of movies based on this character. The novels mentioned will 
be brought to the screen, and Vachss is to create future works for these films. 
He has been described as a cross between Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, 
with Burke called "the lord of the asphalt jungle." 
</P>
<P>
Burke will first be seen on screen in "Blue Belle." Other Vachss characters are 
also to appear -- Mama Wong, Max the Silent, Prof, Mole and Pansy, Burke's 
deadly Neapolitan mastiff. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Vachss has repeatedly turned down Hollywood's lucrative offers. In 
addition to writing books for Knopf, Vachss is an attorney in private practice 
specializing in cases of juvenile justice and child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
MOVIE INDUSTRY experts are still puzzling over the surprise success of this 
year's two big hits -- "Pretty Woman" and "Ghost." These films did not boast 
car chases or excessive macho violence, yet each grossed more than $100 
million. Hollywood is flabbergasted. 
</P>
<P>
One insider quips after reading the Variety grosses: "What we need now is a 
movie about a hooker who comes back from the dead. That would clear $200 
million in no time!"

KENNY G SEEKING NEW DIRECTIONS IN HIS LIFE AND MUSIC

<P>
For soprano-saxophone superstar Kenny G, change is in the air. 
</P>
<P>
He has moved to a house he bought a few months ago in this exclusive Seattle 
suburb, a finger of land jutting into Lake Washington, and recently bought a 
small airplane to fly between gigs. 
</P>
<P>
He says he has discovered the joys of mountain hot springs and rarely listens 
to the music that earned the Arista recording star three Grammy nominations for 
best pop instrumental performance. 
</P>
<P>
Billboard magazine named him contemporary artist of 1989 and artist of the 
decade and named his "Silhouette" album of the year for 1989 and "Duotones" 
jazz album of the decade. He was also voted top instrumentalist in the Rolling 
Stone magazine readers' poll. 
</P>
<P>
What's next? 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a few songs, a few ideas, but my next album is going to take me 
probably a lot longer to make than the other ones," he said. "My last few 
albums -- I love all the songs and each song has a different message, a 
different melody -- (but) the essence has a lot of similarities and I want to 
try to see if I can find something that is a step in a different direction." 
</P>
<P>
What direction? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. I just want to start playing my saxophone and have a melody come 
to me," he said. "To do that, what I'm going to have to do is sit on the dock 
and just relax, just hang out, play my saxophone and not work too hard." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to make the right choices, but it's more important for me to kind 
of stay out of the way and just let it happen, you know, and not try to control 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Gorelick, Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude accounting graduate of the 
University of Washington, bought his first soprano saxophone 18 years ago, when 
he was 15, for $300. 
</P>
<P>
His former instructors, Johnnie Jessen, 81, who played in the vaudeville and 
big-band eras, and University of Washington jazz-band leader Roy Cummings, 
remember him for a practice-practice-practice work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff was speed-demon fingering that helped get him his first break, a 
weekend gig with Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra at age 17. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, he was the only white player in the funky soul band Cold, Bold and 
Together, fondly remembered in Seattle since its brief existence in the 
mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Being the only white guy in the band was one of the biggest learning 
experiences of my life," he told the Seattle Times last spring. "I not only 
crossed the color barrier; I found people were as happy to hear my blue-eyed 
soul as they were to hear the real thing. I got over my stage fright once and 
for all." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years with Jeff Lorber Fusion of Portland, Ore., led to his first 
solo release, "Kenny G," a stage name he adopted because it "had a nice ring to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Big money began rolling in with "Songbird," a hit tune that helped sell more 
than 3 million copies of "Duotones." The inspiration for the tune was Lindie 
Benson, an acting student and his companion since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
One of his performance trademarks is continuous breathing, inhaling through his 
nose while blowing out through his mouth, to maintain a note for long, soulful 
moments of suspense. Fans leap to their feet, clapping and cheering, as he 
slides into a smooth riff and the band picks up the beat. 
</P>
<P>
Playing, Kenny G said, "is a very happy feeling. It's coming from a divine 
place where I think all art comes from. Just think about the fact that it's 
actually inside of me, going through me and then coming out. It's just 
unbelievable, a total euphoric kind of high." 
</P>
<P>
He says he never listens to his own music after it's recorded and rarely to any 
other recorded music. "I really like the silence," he said. "I like just 
sitting out there and listening to the waves. I do. I like the silence."

TALKS TO BRING 'MISS SAIGON' TO N.Y. 'CORDIAL'

Talks between British producer Cameron Mackintosh and officials of Actors 
Equity union over the casting of the Broadway production of "Miss Saigon" have 
been "cordial and constructive," it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Mackintosh met Thursday with Alan Eisenberg, executive secretary of Equity, and 
scheduled another meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived earlier this week from London at the invitation of Eisenberg to 
clear the way for the opening of the $10-million hit musical at the Broadway 
Theater next April. 
</P>
<P>
Mackintosh canceled the opening in a dispute with the union over casting 
British actor Jonathan Pryce in the Eurasian starring role that Pryce 
originated in London. 
</P>
<P>
Early last month, Equity barred Pryce from playing on Broadway as the result of 
pressure from members of Asian background who oppose trans-racial casting 
because it takes roles away from Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Mackintosh said he could not allow abridgement of his artistic freedom to cast 
as he pleases. 
</P>
<P>
Equity's governing council reversed its decision on Pryce on Aug. 23 and asked 
Mackintosh to come to New York to discuss reinstatement of "Miss Saigon," which 
already had broken the Broadway record for advance ticket sales by taking in 
$25 million at the box office.

ONTARIO POLICE ARREST 2 PAROLEES IN MURDER, KIDNAPINGS, RAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police arrested two parolees Thursday in connection with the rape and murder 
last weekend of a 15-year-old girl and the abduction, rapes and stabbings of 
two other women. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Rolando Prieto, 24, was arrested about 7 p.m. in an apartment building 
on the 1300 block of West "E" Street in Ontario, said Ontario Police Detective 
Mike Cormican. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Ricardo Estrada, 19, at the 400 block of South Campus Avenue, 
about six blocks from the site where Yvette Woodruff, 15, was killed early 
Sunday, Cormican said. 
</P>
<P>
Woodruff and the two other women, a mother and her daughter, were abducted from 
their Ontario home about 2:15 a.m. Sunday by two suspects who looted the 
residence, police said. 
</P>
<P>
They were abandoned in an industrial area of Ontario, where the teen-ager was 
shot to death and the other two stabbed. All three were raped. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were held on suspicion of one count of murder, three of rape, three of

HEDGECOCK IS CAST IN ROLE OF TALK-SHOW HOST TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When radio listeners tuned in to KSDO Thursday morning, they heard a somewhat 
breathless announcement that there shortly would be a news flash about the 
California Supreme Court's decision on former Mayor Roger Hedgecock's appeal of 
his 13-count felony conviction on campaign-law violations. 
</P>
<P>
What made the announcement so unusual was the person who made it: Roger 
Hedgecock, ex-mayor, radio talk-show host and namesake of The People Vs. Roger 
Hedgecock. 
</P>
<P>
As illustrated by that blurring of the line between reporting the news and 
being the news, Thursday's "Roger Hedgecock Show" was unorthodox even by the 
admittedly loose standards of talk-show radio. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the morning, Hedgecock acted as master of ceremonies for a spirited 
dialogue on his case, interviewing his own attorney at length about the meaning 
of the high court's decision amid accepting congratulatory calls from listeners 
and fielding on-air questions from a studio full of news reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fish and fowl at the same time, and it was a pretty strange 
combination," Hedgecock joked later. "I was just showing you my versatility." 
</P>
<P>
Though the Supreme Court's ruling dominated the four-hour program, Hedgecock's 
other on-air duties and normal radio talk-show fare occasionally intruded. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he promised listeners that they would get the news about his 5-year-old 
case "live -- at the same time I do," Hedgecock also was chatting with viewers 
and guests on subjects as disparate as racism, voting patterns and underwater 
photography. Moments before the 9:30 a.m. ruling, Hedgecock calmly noted that 
it was time to take a break for "traffic, news and weather." 
</P>
<P>
When the subsequent news bulletin reported that the Supreme Court had reversed 
the 4th District Court of Appeal, without explaining precisely what that meant, 
Hedgecock chuckled softly as he told listeners, "I'm probably as perplexed as 
you are as to what that means." 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to clear the confusion, Hedgecock launched into a lengthy telephone 
interview with his attorney, Charles Sevilla, struggling to remain somewhat 
objective about the topic. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some confusion here in the newsroom as to what the Supreme Court 
ruling actually is in my case," Hedgecock said. "It didn't strike anybody 
around here as something we could understand. A lot of legal terms were used. 
So we'll turn now to my legal expert, Chuck Sevilla, who joins us now on the 
KSDO news line. . . . What's up, Chuck?" 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla, who was being handed faxed pages of the court decision even as he 
interpreted it for his client's listeners, told talk-show host Hedgecock what 
citizen Hedgecock wanted to hear: that he had been "unconvicted" of 12 felony 
perjury counts and that the remaining conspiracy count was "hanging by a 
thread" pending a court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
As Sevilla detailed the ruling, Hedgecock interrupted to remind him of plans 
for an afternoon news conference -- a matter the two proceeded to discuss as 
casually as two people arranging a lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's shoot for 2 (p.m.)," Hedgecock told Sevilla. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the ruling "a pretty good victory on the road to getting this 
straightened out," Hedgecock said: "My first thought was relief that we're 
finally getting somewhere. From my standpoint, finally -- five years later." 
</P>
<P>
While he predicted vindication on the remaining conspiracy count, Hedgecock 
kept his characteristic cockiness in check during most of the 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
show. One of the few moments when his temper flared came when a newspaper 
reporter suggested that the ruling might be interpreted as simply an evasion of 
justice due to legal technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about technicalities," Hedgecock angrily shot back. 
"Directing a jury verdict is not a technicality -- it's a kangaroo court. 
Tampering with the jury, pressuring the jury with booze and stories . . . is 
not a technicality." 
</P>
<P>
Then, it was time to get back to those phone-in lines to accept congratulations 
and wishes of good luck from, among others, Rosie in Chula Vista, Chris and 
"Dan on his car phone." Typical of most callers, Dan simply said, "I hope this 
is the end of it for you." 
</P>
<P>
By day's end, Hedgecock summarized his dual role as news maker and news 
commentator as "pretty peculiar, even for me." 
</P>
<P>
"Here's the subject of the hot, breaking news that shoved even the Middle East 
aside sitting in a studio, talking about underwater photography," Hedgecock 
said. "And then talking about your own case in what was virtually an on-air 
news conference. It was tough to know which side of the microphone I was on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHRONOLOGY OF THE LEGAL WOES OF FORMER MAYOR ROGER HEDGECOCK 
</P>
<P>
* Feb. 9, 1984: The J. David &amp; Co. investment firm is sued by an investor 
who claims that the owner, J. David (Jerry) Dominelli failed to return a $1.2 
million deposit. Hedgecock friend Nancy Hoover, who was Dominelli's business 
aide and girlfriend as well as a former mayor of Del Mar, provides the link for 
what prosecutors alleged was a conspiracy to illegally funnel thousands of 
dollars into Hedgecock's 1983 mayoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
* Feb. 27, 1984: The state's Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) begins 
an investigation into Hedgecock's finances. 
</P>
<P>
* April 9, 1984: The D.A. opens a criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
* May 22, 1984: District Atty. Edwin Miller files a civil suit against 
Hedgecock, political consultant Tom Shepard and others, claiming the mayor and 
his advisers concealed as much as $357,000 in "laundered" campaign 
contributions from the now bankrupt J. David &amp; Co. and Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
* June 5, 1984: Hedgecock wins the mayoral primary but is forced into a 
November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
* June 30, 1984: The first grand jury to look into Hedgecock's finances is 
dismantled without returning an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
* July 30, 1984: A second grand jury begins hearing the first of 82 witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
* Sept. 19, 1984: The grand jury indicts Hedgecock, Hoover, Shepard and 
Dominelli on felony conspiracy and perjury charges alleging that they schemed 
to circumvent city campaign donation limits. 
</P>
<P>
* Sept. 28, 1984: Hedgecock and three co-defendants plead not guilty to all 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
* Oct. 15, 1984: The FPPC files a $1.2 million suit against Hedgecock, Shepard, 
Hoover, Dominelli, and others, citing more than 450 violations of the city's 
campaign laws. The FPPC asks for for nearly $1 million in penalties from 
Hedgecock alone. 
</P>
<P>
* Nov. 6, 1984: Hedgecock overwhelmingly wins reelection and proclaims: "One 
down and one to go." 
</P>
<P>
* Nov. 15, 1984: The grand jury again indicts Hedgecock, charging him with two 
more counts of perjury because he did not report a $3,000 payment from 
Dominelli in Dec. 1981. 
</P>
<P>
* Dec. 3, 1984: Opening arguments begin in the first Hedgecock trial. 
</P>
<P>
* Jan. 22, 1985: Hedgecock takes the stand, emphatically denying he had any 
knowledge of the so-called conspiracy and saying the perjury charges stemmed 
from "good-faith" mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
* Feb. 13, 1985: Jury votes 11 to 1 for conviction on all counts. Superior 
Court Judge William L. Todd Jr. declares a mistrial and prosecutor Richard D. 
Huffman declares that the D.A. will retry the case. 
</P>
<P>
* Feb. 20, 1985: The D.A. files two additional felony perjury charges and a 
misdemeanor conflict of interest charge against Hedgecock. 
</P>
<P>
* Aug. 20, 1985: Opening arguments begin in the retrial. 
</P>
<P>
* Oct. 9, 1985: Hedgecock is convicted on 13 felony conspiracy and perjury 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
* Oct. 15, 1985: A lawyer representing one of the jurors delivers to Hedgecock 
atty. Oscar Goodman and Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller a letter detailing a series of 
alleged incidents in which bailiff Al Burroughs Jr. purportedly talked with 
jurors about the case in violation of court rules. A sworn statement by another 
juror corroborated some of the details. 
</P>
<P>
* Dec. 10, 1985: Hedgecock resigns as mayor and is sentenced to one year in 
jail, shortly after a ruling by Todd that jury-tampering allegations did not 
affect the Oct. 9 verdict nor did they entitle Hedgecock to a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
* April 25, 1988: The San Diego-based 4th District Court of Appeal orders a 
lower court by a 2 to 1 vote to hold a hearing on whether Hedgecock's 
conviction should be overturned because of the jury-tampering allegations. 
</P>
<P>
* Aug. 19, 1988: The California Supreme Court agrees to review Hedgecock's 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
* June 12, 1990: After a backlog of appeals which delayed the hearing of the 
case for nearly two years, the California Supreme Court listens to Hedgecock 
lawyer Charles Sevilla argue that his client was deprived of a fair trial 
because of judge's errors and jury tampering by a court bailiff. During the 
one-hour hearing, Dep. State Atty. General Robert Foster countered that those 
claims should be dismissed and Hedgecock should serve the year in County Jail 
he was sentenced to. 
</P>
<P>
* Sept. 6, 1990: By a 5-2 vote, the California Supreme Court reversed 12 
perjury convictions because of faulty jury instructions by Todd. The court 
ordered additional hearings on the jury tampering allegations in connection 
with the conspiracy conviction. The conspiracy conviction, if upheld, could 
still mean jail time for Hedgecock.

GAIDO IS DENIED SEAT; SPECIAL ELECTION ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mary Ann Gaido, who successfully sued the city to fill a vacancy on the City 
Council, was officially denied a council seat Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in special session, the City Council instead voted to proceed with a 
Nov. 6 special election to fill the vacancy and to appeal a court order that 
says Gaido should take office. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers said the decision to block Gaido from filling the vacancy 
created by Sally Anne Sheridan's elevation to mayor suggests a political 
backlash against those associated with former Mayor Larry Agran. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all coming down to partisan politics, when we should be concentrating on 
local issues," said Councilwoman Paula Werner, the lone dissenter in a 3-1 vote 
to proceed with the special election. 
</P>
<P>
The vote to keep the special election came minutes before the registrar of 
voters' 5 p.m. deadline to pull items from the Nov. 6 ballot before it goes to 
press. 
</P>
<P>
Werner and Gaido supporters charged that the council's action derails the 
healing process Sheridan spoke of during and after the bitterly fought June 5 
mayoral race. Instead, they said, the action simply prolongs divisiveness 
created by an election that pitted Sheridan's conservative slate of new 
Councilmen Barry J. Hammond and Willam A. (Art) Bloomer against a liberal slate 
of Agran, Gaido and defeated Councilman Cameron Cosgrove. 
</P>
<P>
"I find the entire situation appalling," said Charlene Turco, a member of the 
city's Community Services Commission. "The new council said it was going to put 
all this behind us and get back in the business of running a city. I haven't 
seen them do that. Instead, we're all a party to playing games, and Irvine is 
becoming the land of litigation." 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove, who failed to win reelection in June, said the new council "is 
exerting its pound of flesh" in an attempt to gain a four-member majority 
through the election. 
</P>
<P>
"This is to be expected," Gaido said of the council's decision to allow five 
candidates to run for the vacant council seat in November. "There is animosity 
there (toward Agran) that is being transferred to me." 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan, however, said the problems surrounding complicated city election laws 
are the result of inaction by previous, Agran-led councils. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an effort to get even," Sheridan said. "This is an effort to 
resolve the festering sores of the Agran legacy." 
</P>
<P>
Gaido's attorney, Christopher Mears, said that he, too, plans to take Gaido's 
plight to the court of appeals. Shortly before the council's vote, Orange 
County Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore declined to issue an order that 
Gaido be seated on the council immediately, saying she believed it was outside 
her jurisdiction, Mears said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Moore ruled in favor of Gaido, but her decision has been 
temporarily overridden by a notice of appeal filed that day by the city 
attorney, said City Manager Paul O. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hammond said he is simply trying to preserve the petition process 
approved by voters in a 1988 initiative known as Measure D. Under Measure D, 
the remaining term of a council member who is elected mayor would be filled by 
the third-highest vote-getter in the council election, unless 7% of the city's 
registered voters petition for a special election. 
</P>
<P>
Gaido was the third-highest vote-getter in the June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
Two candidates in the November special election, Albert Nasser and Carol Yocum, 
told the council Thursday that they would rather see Gaido seated. Gaido, 
however, did not file as a candidate in the special election because she 
believed she would prevail in court. WENDY PAULSON

passes for 206 yards, and Greg Bell, who ran for 128 yards, both ran for 
second-half touchdowns. Ellard caught five passes for 99 yards and tight end 
Pete Holohan had five catches for 76. The defense, led by linebacker Kevin

loss of 28 yards. And the Falcons managed just 46 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 2 
</P>
<P>
Rams 31, Indianapolis Colts 17

At one point, Everett completed 14 consecutive passes, a team record. Dickerson

Rams 41, Green Bay Pakcers 38 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell, left, rambled for a career-high 221 yards on 28 carries in Anaheim, 
but the Rams almost let this one get away. After building a 38-7 halftime lead 
with the help of four Packer turnovers, Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski, 
who threw for 335 yards, engineered four consecutive scoring drives that cut 
the Rams' lead to seven. The Packers were on the verge of tying the game when 
linebacker Frank Stams forced running back Brent Fullwood to fumble on the goal 
line and defensive end Doug Reed recovered. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 4 
</P>
<P>
Rams 13, San Francisco 49ers 12 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lansford's 26-yard field goal with two seconds left to play lifted the 
Rams to a come-from-behind victory in San Francisco. The 49ers led, 12-10, when 
fullback Tom Rathman fumbled deep in Rams' territory and Kevin Greene 
recovered. Jim Everett then orchestrated a nine-play, 72-yard drive that took 
most of the last three minutes of the game and set up Lansford's game-winning 
kick. Everett completed five passes during the drive, including two to tight 
end Pete Holohan for 31 and 16 yards. Mike Cofer's four field goals accounted 
for all the 49er scoring. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 5 
</P>
<P>
Rams 26, 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Falcons 14 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lansford kicked four field goals and Jim Everett threw two touchdown 
passes as the Rams completed a season sweep of the Falcons in Anaheim. The Rams 
scored on their first four possessions and led, 20-7, at the half. The Rams' 
defense put together two goal-line stands to thwart a Falcon comeback. Kevin 
Greene again sacked Chris Miller twice. Henry Ellard caught eight passes for 
165 yards and Ron Brown's 76-yard kickoff return set up Lansford's third field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 6 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo Bills 23, 
</P>
<P>
Rams 20 
</P>
<P>
It appeared as if the Rams had picked up their sixth consecutive victory when 
Jim Everett hooked up with Flipper Anderson for a 78-yard scoring play with 
less than two minutes remaining in the game at Orchard Park, N.Y. But, with 
1:17 remaining left to play, Bills' quarterback Frank Reich connected on seven 
passes in a row on a 64-yard drive that was culminated by an 8-yard touchdown 
pass to Andre Reed that sent the Rams to their first defeat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 7 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans Saints 40, 
</P>
<P>
Rams 21 
</P>
<P>
The Saints opened up a 10-0 lead and then outscored the Rams, 23-0, in a 
stretch of the second and third quarters en route to a rout in Anaheim. Saints' 
quarterback Bobby Hebert completed only 15 of 22 passes and threw one 
interception, but he also threw three touchdown passes. Dalton Hilliard rushed 
for 87 yards and two touchdowns and also scored on a 20-yard pass reception. 
Jim Everett was intercepted twice and threw three touchdown passes, two to 
tight end Damone Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 8 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Bears 20, 
</P>
<P>
Rams 10 
</P>
<P>
In a game dominated by defense, the Bears were able to pull ahead in the second 
half and hold off the Rams in Chicago. Mike Lansford's 45-yard field goal 
midway through the second quarter opened the scoring and the teams were tied, 
3-3, at the half. A 24-yard pass interference penalty called on Anthony Newman 
led to the first touchdown of the day, a 1-yard run by Chicago's Brad Muster. 
The Bears took a 17-3 lead with 11:11 to play on a 1-yard quarterback sneak by 
Jim Harbaugh. Jim Everett completed just 13 of 35 passes and was intercepted 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 9 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Vikings 23, Rams 21 
</P>
<P>
Viking linebacker Mike Merriweather, above, streaked into the Ram backfield and 
blocked a Dale Hatcher punt, the ball went through the end zone and the 
first-ever overtime NFL game was decided by an safety in Minneapolis. Viking 
Rich Karlis kicked seven field goals to tie a league record. The seventh, a 
40-yarder with 12 seconds remaining in regulation, sent the game into overtime 
after the Rams had rallied from an 18-7 deficit. The Rams took the lead on a 
1-yard run by Greg Bell. Henry Ellard caught four passes for 82 yards, 
including a fourth-down, 6-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 10 
</P>
<P>
Rams 31, New York Giants 10 
</P>
<P>
The Rams snapped their four-game losing streak in grand fashion as Jim Everett 
threw for two touchdowns and Greg Bell ran for two more in Anaheim. The Rams 
led, 10-0, after one quarter and 24-3 at halftime. On their first possession of 
the second half, the Rams drove 76 yards on 11 plays with Bell scoring on a 
2-yard run to boost their lead to 31-3. Bell (14 carries for 42 yards), 
Cleveland Gary (8 for 45 yards), Robert Delpino (11 for 34) and Buford McGee (5 
for 17) shared the rushing duties. Eight different Rams caught passes. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 11 
</P>
<P>
Rams 37, Phoenix Cardinals 14 
</P>
<P>
Things went bad quickly for Phoenix in Anaheim as Michael Stewart intercepted a 
Gary Hogeboom pass and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown with just 1:41 
expired in the game. Then they got worse. The Rams took a 24-0 halftime lead 
and the Cardinals' first score -- a 77-yard pass from Tom Tupa to Don Holmes -- 
didn't come until less than five minutes remained in the third quarter. Jerry 
Gray had two interceptions for the Rams, Henry Ellard caught five passes for 
163 yards and two touchdowns, and Mike Lansford kicked three field goals. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 12 
</P>
<P>
Rams 20, New Orleans Saints 17 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lansford's 31-yard field goal 6:38 into overtime gave the Rams a 
come-from-behind overtime victory in New Orleans. The Rams trailed, 17-3, in 
the fourth quarter, but rallied to score a pair of touchdowns in the final 2:46 
of regulation. Buford McGee culminated a 61-yard drive with a 5-yard touchdown 
run to cut the Saints' lead to 17-10. Jim Everett's 15-yard pass to Flipper 
Anderson tied the score, 17-17. Lansford missed a 51-yard field goal attempt as 
time ran out in regulation. Anderson, who had 15 receptions for an NFL 
single-game record of 336 yards, caught No. 15 for 26 yards to set up the 
game-winner by Lansford, above, who celebrated with Pete Holohan. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 13 
</P>
<P>
Rams 35, 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Cowboys 31 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys fumbled on their first two possessions in Irving, Tex., the Rams 
recovered both and took a 14-0 lead. But Dallas rebounded to cut the deficit to 
14-10 at the half. The Cowboys, scoring on three Troy Aikman touchdown passes 
in the second half, went ahead, 31-21, but Larry Kelm recovered another Dallas 
fumble and Jim Everett hooked up with Ron Brown for a 39-yard scoring play two 
plays later. The Rams took the lead with 1:50 left to play when Aaron Cox, 
right, caught a 23-yard touchdown pass from Everett. Dallas' attempt to win the 
game stalled on the Ram 17 as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 14 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 49ers 30, 
</P>
<P>
Rams 27 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers outscored the Rams, 20-3, in the final quarter to beat the Rams in 
Anaheim. The Rams built a 17-0 advantage, scoring on their first three 
possessions. Late in the second quarter, the Rams drove 76 yards to the 49er 
four-yard line and, on fourth-and-goal, Pete Holohan came up one yard short of 
the end zone on a fake field goal play. The 49ers' John Taylor, right, twice 
turned short passes into long touchdowns -- of 92 and 95 yards -- and Joe 
Montana finished another brilliant performance in Anaheim Stadium completing 30 
of 42 passes for 458 yards. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 15 
</P>
<P>
Rams 38, 
</P>
<P>
New York Jets 14 
</P>
<P>
The Rams took advantage of three New York turnovers, converting each into a 
touchdown, on their way to a romp in Anaheim. Linebacker Brett Faryniarz led a 
defensive charge that sacked Jets' quarterbacks Tony Eason and Ken O'Brien 
seven times. Faryniarz had three sacks, recovered two fumbles and caused one. 
Brian Smith had two sacks for the Rams. Greg Bell scored a pair of touchdowns 
as the Rams compiled 422 yards of total offense. 
</P>
<P>
WEEK 16 
</P>
<P>
Rams 24, New England Patriots 20 
</P>
<P>
The Rams scored to take the lead with 1:55 remaining in the game and then 
managed a goal-line stand to hold off the Patriots on Christmas Eve in Foxboro, 
Mass. Greg Bell rushed for 210 yards on 26 carries and one touchdown. The Rams 
went ahead, 17-3, early in the third quarter, but New England came back to 
forge a 17-17 tie. Jason Staurovsky's 48-yard field goal put the Patriots up, 
20-17, but the Rams drove 80 yards, capped by 3-yard Bell touchdown with 1:55 
left. Then the Rams survived three Grogan pass attempts from the Ram 4 in the 
last nine seconds. 
</P>
<P>
NFC WILD-CARD PLAYOFF 
</P>
<P>
Rams 21, 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia Eagles 7 
</P>
<P>
The Ram defense kept the Eagles out of the end zone until the fourth quarter on 
New Year's Eve in Philadelphia. And the offense struck quickly as Jim Everett 
threw two first-quarter touchdown passes. The Rams threatened to score twice 
more before the half, but were stopped by turnovers. The Rams rolled up 409 
yards of total offense with Everett completing 18 of 33 passes for 281 yards 
and Greg Bell rushing for 124 yards on 27 carries. The Eagles didn't get a 
first down in the first quarter and managed just 95 yards rushing. Kevin Greene 
had two sacks and Fred Strickland registered 11 tackles. Willie Anderson, left, 
and Aaron Cox, celebrated with a victory slap.

<P>
NFC PLAYOFF SEMIFINALS 
</P>
<P>
Rams 19, 
</P>
<P>
New York Giants 13 
</P>
<P>
No Ram fan will forget Flipper Anderson's sprint into the end zone on a 30-yard 
pass play in overtime . . . or his subsequent run into the tunnel at Giants 
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Trailing, 13-7, going into the fourth quarter, 
the Rams tied the game on a pair of Mike Lansford field goals. The Rams won the 
overtime coin toss and began a 77-yard drive that was aided by a play no Giant 
fan will forget, the 27-yard pass interference call on Sheldon White. Two Raul 
Allegre field goals gave the Giants a 6-0 first-quarter lead, but Jim Everett 
and Anderson, left, hooked up for a touchdown in the final seconds of the half. 
Henry Ellard finished with eight catches for 125 yards. 
</P>
<P>
NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 49ers 30, 
</P>
<P>
Rams 3 
</P>
<P>
From the Rams' standpoint, there was absolutely nothing charming about third 
meeting between these teams. The Rams managed just 156 total yards; the 49ers 
racked up 442. Jim Everett completed 44% of his passes and was intercepted 
twice; Joe Montana completed 87% of his passes and had none intercepted. The 
Rams rushed for 26 yards; the 49ers ran for 179. The Rams lost two fumbles; the 
49ers lost none. The Rams did lead, 3-0, in the first quarter, but never 
advanced beyond the San Francisco 40-yard line again. The 49ers could have 
started packing for the Super Bowl after scoring touchdowns on all three of 
their second-quarter possessions.

JIM EVERETT

<P>
Ram quarterback Coach Dick Coury on Jim Everett: "Probably next to Joe Montana, 
he's as good as any quarterback in the NFL. How's that for a summary? Because 
of his knowledge of the game and his tremendous ability to lead a team. He's 
always been an excellent leader since the day he got here. He's probably one of 
our best-conditioned players, both physically and mentally. He's just an 
outstanding guy."

They became the fastest of friends, two rookie wide receivers, each blessed 
with speed and ability. 
</P>
<P>
Flipper Anderson shrugged, and smiled his shy smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Pisces," he said. "Both the same type person -- laid-back, quiet, like to 
joke around, easy going." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was born with the name Willie on March 7, 1965, in Paulsboro, N.J. Six 
days later, Aaron Cox was born in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three years later, the Rams picked Cox, a receiver out of Arizona State, 
in the first round of the NFL draft, using their second selection. The next 
round, they took Anderson, a receiver out of UCLA, using their fourth pick. 
</P>
<P>
"We both came in the same year, playing the same position," Cox said. "We had a 
lot in common, and did all the same things together, the same meetings, 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
They became friends, two fish in a big new sea. 
</P>
<P>
Their rookie year, Cox started 15 of the Rams' 16 games and caught 28 passes 
for 590 yards. He was the first-rounder, the high-profile pick. Flipper caught 
11 passes playing behind him, and played around in general, too taken with the 
idea of being in the NFL to really excel. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Cox pulled a hamstring during training camp, and missed the 
preseason and the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
And Flipper was gone in a flicker. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson went deep on Cox, overtaking the starting position without ever 
looking back. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't much different from the pass Anderson caught in overtime of a playoff 
game against the New York Giants last year. 
</P>
<P>
Score tied, sudden death, ball at the Giants 30. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson streaked down the right sideline, past cornerback Mark Collins, past 
everyone. He hauled in Jim Everett's pass for the winning touchdown, and he 
kept running. Ran off the field, through the end zone and into the stadium 
tunnel. Ran out of the Giants Stadium for all anyone could see, and halfway 
back to California, for all anyone could imagine. 
</P>
<P>
"Funny, if it was holding or something, I never would have seen it," Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the Giants -- nor Cox -- had a prayer of catching him. 
</P>
<P>
The victory sprint, dazzling in its decisiveness, was one Anderson and Cox, 
still fast friends, had plotted on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"We were on the sidelines, going to overtime, and Aaron said, 'I've got an 
opportunity to catch the ball and keep on running,' " Anderson said. "I said, 
'Yeah, me too. I hope I get the opportunity.' How many times do you get the 
opportunity to catch the ball and the game be over? I got that chance, and I 
just kept on going and didn't look back." 
</P>
<P>
Cox exulted for him. He says he always does. 
</P>
<P>
"Friendship comes first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson took Cox's job, and it does not look as if he will relinquish it. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, the Rams' third receiver behind All-Pro Henry Ellard and Anderson, caught 
20 passes last year for 340 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson caught 44 for 1,146 yards -- 336 of them in an NFL record-setting 
performance against New Orleans -- and five touchdowns, with a dazzling average 
of 26 yards a catch. Anderson and Ellard became the first Ram receivers to 
reach 1,000 yards in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about that, I dealt with it pretty early," Cox said. "And I was able 
to enjoy watching him have a great year. (The hamstring injury) happened to me 
in preseason, and I knew I'd be out a certain time. And I knew when I came back 
I'd be at least third." 
</P>
<P>
Still there is a certain heaviness to his happiness. His friend's success 
precluded his own. "Being friends helped out," Cox said. "It would have been 
different if we didn't get along. If this guy I couldn't stand took my 
position, it would be different." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was happy with his own success, but he never gloated. 
</P>
<P>
"He was real calm," Cox said. "He never talked about the catches he made. He 
was kind of embarrassed about other people talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
On the flip-side, Anderson knew it was not an easy time for Cox. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard," Anderson said. "That is a hard one. I don't know, it is a bad 
thing. He hurt his leg, but it an was an opportunity for myself. I took 
advantage of that. It wasn't like I was wishing bad on him, but I just went out 
there and did what the coaches asked. It worked well for myself. It turned out 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Cox) was more hurt that his hamstring was hurt (than that Anderson 
passed him). Throughout the ordeal, we always maintained best friends. He 
helped me on things. I'd ask questions. Am I doing this right? What am I doing 
on this route? What am I doing on that route? We were always there for each 
other to ask each other questions." 
</P>
<P>
This preseason, both Anderson and Cox as well as Henry Ellard have been held 
out of games with hamstring injuries. This time, that won't engender any change 
in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, there's nothing I can do in a preseason game or early in the 
season to ever come close to getting my spot back as far as a starter," Cox 
said. "Maybe it's just my role to be a third receiver." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson and Cox will confer on the sidelines again this season, same as ever, 
each plotting his next exploit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always thinking we're going to score a touchdown," Cox said. "Flip will 
say, 'Ace, I'm feeling good, I think I'm going to go deep."' 
</P>
<P>
That has been Anderson's talent: Flipper knows the ways of the deep. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to get 1,000 yards and I like to catch touchdown passes," Anderson 
said. "And I like to get the yardage in big chunks. Ever since college, I've 
had a high average per catch. I'd like to keep that up." 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 29 yards a catch as a rookie, his average falling to 26 yards last 
season. Ironically, his average was brought down by his performance against New 
Orleans Nov. 26, which was not only the best game of his career, but in one 
way, the best any NFL receiver had ever had. Anderson caught 15 passes for 336 
yards, breaking the NFL single-game receiving yardage record of 309 yards held 
by Kansas City's Stephone Paige. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at it, the New Orleans game hurt my average a lot," Anderson said, 
and laughed. "It was kind of a schoolyard day for myself and Jim. You throw it, 
I'll get it." 
</P>
<P>
With Ellard sidelined with a hamstring injury, Anderson became Everett's first 
target. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were down, 17-3, after three quarters, but came back. Buford McGee 
scored the first of two fourth-quarter touchdowns on a five-yard run set up by 
Anderson's 43-yard catch. With 1:02 left in regulation, Anderson scored the 
tying touchdown on a 15-yard reception, helping force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lansford kicked a field goal in overtime to win it, a 31-yard attempt set 
up by a pass interference penalty drawn by Anderson against the Saints, and 
Anderson's catches of 14 and 26 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's talent had been "unleashed," Coach John Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, his role will be less secondary than it was last year. 
</P>
<P>
"When both he and Henry are in the game at the same time, one is going to get 
more opportunities," Robinson said. "But if the best opportunity is to go to 
Flipper, we'll do that. Last year, we might have restructured to try to get 
Henry open. Now, I think we're looking at co-stars out there. I see it more as 
co-No. 1s." 
</P>
<P>
Ellard will remain more the ball-control receiver, with Flipper still the deep 
threat, always capable of striking quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I can run the deep routes," Anderson said. "What would help my game 
is to run the intermediate routes better. That would give another dimension to 
my game, and give the defensive backs something else to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
To do that, Anderson watches Ellard, whose precise routes he admires. 
</P>
<P>
"Those outs and ins, its hard to run those routes," Anderson said. "I've gotten 
much better since my first year. I need to improve my cuts. I don't know, maybe 
I go too fast or something sometimes. I have to slow myself down in order to 
come out of the breaks faster." 
</P>
<P>
He works on those routes, but he always has his marvelous ability to go deep. 
</P>
<P>
There is more to it than pure speed, although Anderson, a slight 6 feet and 175 
pounds, runs a 4.42 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
"I think being relaxed while the ball is in the air is important," he said. "A 
lot of people tend to stop running when they look at the ball, stop working for 
it. They see the ball in the air and they slow down. You've got to keep 
running, and at the last second, reach for it. I think that's where a lot of 
defensive backs go wrong, they're looking for the ball. That's where you see 
that separation, where the receiver is still running but it looks like the 
defensive back is slowing down." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson keeps running. 
</P>
<P>
"In college, coach (Homer) Smith always used to tell us to work the inside arm. 
Keep that inside arm pumping, and it will help you to stay up on your speed and 
maintain it." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson admires Anderson's ability. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a real sense of where the ball is going, and a sense of timing," 
Robinson said. "He can run and see the ball at one time, which maybe another 
receiver can't do. He doesn't lose his stride or balance. He's like a great 
outfielder in baseball . . . it looks easy." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that does not look easy is trying to duplicate last season -- the 
336-yard day, the sprint after the game-winner against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're approaching him in training camp by saying, 'Try to improve the 
execution of your job,' " Robinson said. " 'Don't worry about number of 
catches. Those are things you can't control.' " 
</P>
<P>
Anderson understands that. 
</P>
<P>
"They were special situations," Anderson said. "How could you get all those 
type situations in one year? Some players don't have those type situations 
their whole career. I'm just happy they happened to me. I can't live on what 
happened last year. I have to go out and make things happen for the team this 
year. If the situation comes, I'll try to take advantage of those situations 
and try to respond in the right way. And if they don't arrive, hopefully I'll 
do whatever is needed -- catch the long ball, catch the eight-yard ball, 
whatever the team needs. Just help us to win."

THE CURTAIN RISES AGAIN FOR CHINESE DEFECTOR; 
</P>
<P>
HUA WENYI AND TWO OTHER OPERA ARTISTS WILL MAKE THEIR FIRST U.S. APPEARANCES 
THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRACE WAI-TSE SIAO, Siao is the Southern California correspondent of the San 
Francisco-based newspaper Asian Week. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In China in 1987, Hua Wenyi won a Plum Blossom Award, an honor comparable to an 
Oscar in America. Today the actress, regarded in much the same way Western 
audiences view Elizabeth Taylor and Helen Hayes, cooks and keeps house in 
Monterey Park, occasionally works for a dry cleaner and teaches Kun opera for a 
living in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't find it difficult adjusting to life in America," she said, having 
spent years doing chores for the husband and daughter she left in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Little Mei Lanfang" after the late, internationally renowned Beijing 
opera artist, Hua, 46, was director of the 160-member Shanghai Kunju Company 
from 1985-87. 
</P>
<P>
On the troupe's fourth U.S. visit 16 months ago, Hua and seven others 
"disappeared" on July 26, 1989, from their San Francisco hotel rooms, several 
days before their scheduled departure. 
</P>
<P>
They took advantage of President Bush's directive allowing Chinese nationals to 
stay because of the massacre in Tian An Men Square. "It was an opportunity for 
me. I was tired of the hectic performing schedule in China and wanted to learn 
new things here," Hua said, speaking in Mandarin during an interview at her 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next four months, their whereabouts were a mystery. News services 
reported the eight were hiding in San Francisco, New York City and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But some of them, including Chen Tongshen, 43, were hiding with friends in Los 
Angeles. Although "shaking with fear" for the first few months, he eventually 
applied for a Social Security card and found a job as a cook in a Chinese 
restaurant in Los Angeles in November. 
</P>
<P>
Chen, Hua and fellow defector Zhong Weide, 50, now plan to make their first 
U.S. appearances Saturday and Sunday at Japan America Theatre as part of the 
Los Angeles Festival's evening of Kun opera, a program reuniting seven of eight 
performers here for the first time since July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Although called a "national treasure" in China as star of its oldest and most 
elegant form of theater, the 5-foot, 5-inch, 125-pound Hua is little-known in 
the Southland Chinese community except within Kun opera circles, and she takes 
her anonymity lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need to be known by a lot of people," she said. "I want to perform 
less and teach more, and I think I have a better chance of doing that here." 
</P>
<P>
After more than two decades onstage, Hua would rather let younger actresses 
take the limelight, she said. In China, few people entered Kun opera during the 
Cultural Revolution of the '60s, and without experienced performers to fill 
roles, artists in their 40s were required to fulfill a demanding schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The workload took its toll. "It's been a hard life. . . . At that pace, I would 
probably (have) only continued for another year or two," Hua said. "China is a 
very group-oriented society. Individualism is not tolerated. Modesty is 
emphasized. No one is (supposed) to take credit for his or her accomplishments. 
. . . We were expected to do exactly as we were told -- the party takes charge 
of us as if we were children." 
</P>
<P>
Because of China's severe housing shortage, Hua, her husband and their 
18-year-old daughter, a university freshman majoring in tourism, had been 
living either with Hua's in-laws or her parents since they married nearly 19 
years ago. Shortly before her decision to defect, Hua and her husband obtained 
their own small three-room apartment. 
</P>
<P>
In China, her parents' and family's reaction toward her decision to defect has 
been neutral. "They said, 'It's up to you, you think it over,' " Hua said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping her daughter will join her in America someday, Hua is unsure whether her 
husband, who is a Beijing opera actor himself, would want to move to America. 
She did not have the chance to discuss the matter with him before her 
defection. Although she had communicated with him since, "It's been difficult 
for him to understand my decision" Hua said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Shanghai, Zhu Rongji, urged her to return during his recent visit 
to Los Angeles, she said. "I replied that I love my country and will go back 
some day. But meanwhile, I see nothing wrong with staying to introduce Kun 
opera to the people here who liked my show and wanted to learn." 
</P>
<P>
She has not heard from Zhu since, and he was the only Chinese official who has 
ever contacted her concerning her defection. She claims she no longer worries 
about her safety. "The Chinese overnment seems pretty open about (defection) 
these days," Hua said. 
</P>
<P>
Zhong also worked for menial wages, managing a Los Angeles motel. Known for his 
"painted face" role, he will play a Buddhist monk who danced to oblivion on 
country roads after whisking some good wine from a hawker passing by in "Dead 
Drunk, Lu Zhisheng Practices Martial Arts." 
</P>
<P>
Chen, dubbed "live Monkey King" because of his well-known portrayal of the 
fabled character, will play the hero in an episode of his legendary trip to the 
West. In "The Monkey King Borrows the Fan," he sought help from a princess to 
put out a wildfire that prevented him from continuing the journey. 
</P>
<P>
Hua will play a young woman who yearns to break from the constraints of 
traditional Chinese feudal society in "Strolling in the Garden, Stirred by the 
Dream." In it, she falls in love with a handsome young man, but discovers it 
was all a dream. 
</P>
<P>
Her presence brought about last year's formation of the Chinese Kun Opera 
Society in Monterey Park, whose 25 members have been meeting for 10 years. 
Under Hua's direction, the group presented "Broken Bridge," an episode from the 
"White Snake" legend last June. 
</P>
<P>
She hopes the festival performances would help spread the interest in Chinese 
Kun opera. "The first few years may not be easy, but it will be worth it in the 
long run," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Performances at the Japan America Theatre, 244 S. San Pedro St., begin at 8 
p.m. Detailed program notes in English and Chinese will be provided. Ticket 
information: (213) 623-7400.

<P>
JAZZ: REVOLUTIONARY SAXOPHONIST ORNETTE COLEMAN REUNITES WITH ORIGINAL SIDEMEN 
AT THE ORPHEUM TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been more than 30 years since Ornette Coleman left Los Angeles to head 
east with a remarkable quartet of musicians. 
</P>
<P>
When the alto saxophonist, trumpeter Don Cherry, bassist Charlie Haden and 
drummer Billy Higgins opened at New York City's Five Spot Cafe in autumn 1959, 
their startlingly liberated approach to improvisation set off a firestorm of 
revolutionary change in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at the Orpheum Theater, a rare reunion of that original quartet will 
take place and Coleman is determined to do so strictly for musical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
He has recently been rehearsing with his former companions in an effort to not 
only recall past glories, but also to demonstrate the continuing viability of 
his unique view of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had lots of offers for us to get back together," he said, "but I didn't 
want to do it if all we did was play the things from the past the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone says, 'Oh, you could make lots of money with your old band.' And, 
poor as I am, I could use the money. But I don't want to go out and exploit a 
name or some history just to make money. 
</P>
<P>
"I rehearsed with Don, Billy and Charlie in Europe for a while this summer. 
What I want to do is make something new that will have the same kind of 
creativity as the things we did in the past." 
</P>
<P>
A soft-spoken, gentle man who turned 60 in March, Coleman is dedicated to a 
highly personalized perception of music that he has labeled "Harmelodics." At 
its core is a belief that each note possesses within itself the echoes of three 
other notes. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're writing a song based on the changes of 'Out of Nowhere,' " he said, 
"you can get together with some guys and quickly work out a way to play it. But 
with the kind of music I play, it's not that easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Don, Billy and Charlie and I haven't been in the same musical environment and 
spent enough time together lately to be perfectly clear yet about what we can 
do today. But we're getting there, and, on a spiritual and emotional level, 
they've been very receptive to the possibilities of what we can do. So I'm 
looking forward to playing together." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's appearance at the L.A. Festival will be part of a collection of 
performances identified as "Local Heroes." Although the intensity and fury of 
Coleman's free jazz style became a media cause celebre after the 
well-publicized New York appearance, his musical preparation -- the careful 
trials and errors, the false starts and the negative critical responses -- had 
been taking place during some hungry years in Los Angeles in the mid-'50s. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Coleman worked with a variety of local musicians, including fellow 
Texan expatriates James Clay, Bobby Bradford and Don Payne, as well as such 
then-prominent figures as Shelly Manne and Red Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting," said music coordinator Titus Levi, who persuaded Coleman to 
appear at the festival, "when you consider the powerful symbiosis between Los 
Angeles and New York that existed for the Coleman band. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a very theatrical opening in New York to give them the attention they 
needed. But, had they gotten together in New York, I don't think the group 
would have developed the same way that they did here. Working in Los Angeles, 
away from what was at that time the contemporary mainstream on the East Coast, 
gave them the time and the freedom to build a four-man cadre that could work 
together on all those new ideas without distractions." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's career has had its ups and downs in the intervening decades. Still 
viewed by many observers as one of the seminal figures of contemporary music, 
he is seen by others as an eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his groups have generated an iconoclastic blending of rock, funk and 
aleatoric tumult. Others have recalled the sound of his earliest ensembles. 
Regardless of the setting, Coleman -- arguably one of the most unique 
improvisers in jazz history -- has continued throughout his career to play with 
the soaring, vocalized sound that is the hallmark of his music. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's compositions -- many for large classical ensembles -- reflect the 
influence of his Harmelodic theories. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started using the Harmelodic system," he said, "I found I could write 
freer lines. I didn't have to worry about styles. Then, when I started writing 
for instruments that you don't ordinarily hear in jazz, I found even more notes 
that I could use. The oboe, for example, has a minor sound built into its 
tuning." 
</P>
<P>
An early interest in ethnic music has been expanded by the connections he finds 
with Harmelodics. 
</P>
<P>
"I've become interested in instruments that are played with both tempered and 
untempered sounds," he said. "I sat in with some Moroccan musicians once, and 
there were 20 guys playing in unison, without using a tempered Western scale. 
Two months ago I was in Catania (Italy), and I met a 75-year-old man who was 
playing a reed instrument; he could play the melody, the harmony and the 
rhythm, all at the same time -- three different sounds." 
</P>
<P>
But Coleman is not bound to his music theories in any restrictive kind of way. 
"Basically," he said, "the end result is what you hear and feel. If you're 
blind, you can't read, but that doesn't mean you can't play. I came to the 
music naturally, and the theory came later." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's recent work includes the continuing maintenance of his seven-piece 
band, which now includes, for the first time since his initial recording, a 
keyboard player. Last year, a commission from the French government resulted in 
a chamber piece for 17 musicians titled "The Country That Gave the Freedom 
Symbol to America." And he has an offer to write an opera for Milan's La Scala 
Opera Company. 
</P>
<P>
Fully recovered from injuries received in a mugging a few years ago that 
collapsed his lungs, Coleman persists, as he has for most of his life, in 
keeping music at the center of his world. Passed over recently by some of the 
large grants and awards, he reacts with a stoic, "Well, let's see what happens 
next time."

Carrie Fisher is getting high. 
</P>
<P>
Not, mind you, on Percodan, Fisher's nasty drug of choice in headier, darker 
days. Right now, her vehicle for getting a buzz on is, well, a vehicle, a 
majestic black BMW to be exact. It is flying down Coldwater Canyon Boulevard, 
Fisher at the helm, on a particularly glorious day in Los Angeles. There is no 
fog anywhere, and even the smog is detectable only in a faint burn at the back 
of the throat. The scratchy strain of Don Henley's "The Boys of Summer" comes 
on the radio, and Fisher leans over to pump up the volume. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the great part of L.A.," she shouts above the roar. "L.A. Rock 'n' 
roll. The car. It's simple. I like the philosophy of medicine. The philosophy 
of medicine is, take this and you'll feel better. I like the philosophy of 
driving, which is, get in this and you'll get somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"So even if it's not a definitive destination, to me, it's a groove to go." 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Fisher is truly riding high these days. Her second novel, "Surrender the 
Pink," is being unpacked in bookstores this week. 
</P>
<P>
The film "Postcards From the Edge" opens next Wednesday, with a script penned 
by Fisher based loosely on her first, best-selling novel about a young actress 
who goes through drug rehab; Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep play 
mother-daughter movie stars at odds and Mike Nichols directs. She's writing a 
screenplay of "Surrender the Pink," the story of a woman obsessed with her 
ex-husband's new relationship, which Steven Spielberg has already bought for a 
cool million. And another Fisher screenplay-in-progress, "Christmas in Las 
Vegas," about under-age kids on the run, has been snapped up by producer Dawn 
Steel. 
</P>
<P>
The once-beleaguered daughter of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher is no longer 
just another Hollywood princess. Her well-documented Angst, "that Jewish 
thing," as her mother calls it, is finally serving Fisher well. (She wonders 
idly whether Sylvia Plath would have lost her gift if she'd ever been treated 
with lithium.) Because these days, Fisher's own mishegoss, her extreme need for 
control that once prompted her to reach for drugs, is now making her reach for 
pens and yellow legal pads, so she can write out in longhand the books and 
screenplays that become instant bestsellers and major Hollywood movies. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, Carrie Fisher would like to take this opportunity to 
tell you that the "emotional stuff" in her work is mainly true, particularly 
when it's about her, but many of the events and characters are fiction. Get it? 
Fiction. 
</P>
<P>
"They trivialize me one way or the other," she says. "Either I don't write 
anything and it's all just my life and everyone is everyone I know and I just 
write it all down or I didn't write it at all." 
</P>
<P>
It really makes her angry when she hears rumors, which are rife in Hollywood, 
that she has ghostwriters. Mirabella magazine reported that Fisher's editor 
Paul Slansky was the real writer of the book "Postcards," but later printed a 
retraction. Heaven help the soul who dares suggest that Carrie Fisher's work 
was written by anyone other than Carrie Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen to what I did. Gavin (de Becker) is a close friend of mine from high 
school and he's at this party with (comedian/director) David Steinberg and 
David Steinberg says, 'Oh, she didn't write "Postcards." ' He said that Paul 
Slansky was the real writer of 'Postcards.' I think this is sexism. Like women 
couldn't possibly do anything. 
</P>
<P>
"So I call my agent, and I write this letter. It says, 'Dear Mr. Steinberg: It 
has come to my client Carrie Fisher's attention that you were not the sole 
director of 'Paternity' but that it was ghost-directed by a Mr. Paul Slansky. 
Miss Fisher wanted to check this rumor with you before chatting about it gaily 
at her next Hollywood event.' " 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, who once worked with Slansky himself, says he merely suggested De 
Becker ask Fisher about their editor-in-common. "I would never characterize 
Carrie's work as belonging to somebody else," he says. "The letter she wrote 
me, I would put it in a book of mine, it's so good." 
</P>
<P>
As for the usually tight-lipped De Becker, security consultant to the stars, 
his lips are sealed: "I will not go on record about something discussed at a 
dinner party." 
</P>
<P>
Slansky, who thinks Fisher is "brilliant," says, "I've heard these rumors, but 
she wrote every word of that book. . . . People have trouble dealing with the 
fact that people are talented in a lot of different areas." 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, Carrie Fisher, 33, has grown up to be something even more 
horrifying than a mere Hollywood princess. She has looks, brains, wealth, 
heritage, numerous talents, vast success, friends, fame and wit. So what if 
she's her own worst critic, exceedingly introspective and so troubled at times 
that she spent years on drugs, therapy and human potential seminars? Who cares 
that she has literally jumped off cliffs, rappelling toward whatever it is that 
seems to elude her? 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Fisher writes a book, it's a bestseller. She writes a screenplay, she 
gets Nichols, Streep and MacLaine. After years of turmoil and some torment, 
Fisher has become that most annoying, fascinating and unlikely creature -- the 
Woman Who Has Almost Everything. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher parks her BMW in front of a low-slung brick home on a leafy North 
Hollywood street. She is wearing a twirly, black cotton dress. She's petite at 
5 foot 1 "and a half." Her mahogany hair is cut in the short, gamin do that she 
rips apart in her novels. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher is greeted at the door by a tall woman in an apron, her grandmother's 
housekeeper, whom Fisher addresses as Mrs. French. She passes through a hall 
lined with celebrity photos with inscriptions dedicated to her mother. At the 
end is a dark bedroom governed by a painted portrait of Debbie Reynolds, where 
her grandmother, Maxene Reynolds, is resting, felled by a headache. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher perches on the side of the bed. "You're sick." 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up with what feels like an oversize watermelon," her grandmother says. 
"It starts back here in my neck. But I was so dizzy. I don't think I'm dizzy 
now. I'm always dizzy. I'm a dizzy broad." 
</P>
<P>
"No, you're not," Fisher says. 
</P>
<P>
"You always tell me that." 
</P>
<P>
"No, I say you're fat and you're old," Fisher says. "But you ain't dizzy." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm all right. I just wanted to rest today," says the grandmother. "A poor 
excuse is better than none, they always told me." 
</P>
<P>
But later, Reynolds admits her pain has almost gotten the better of her. 
"You've never had a headache before. Not like this, honey. It just feels like 
something inside that's got bigger than the skull." 
</P>
<P>
"The Alien," says Fisher. "Remember the one? I don't think you saw that one 
where the alien bursts out of somebody's chest?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, God," the grandmother says. "Maybe there's something growing in there. 
Maybe I'll get a brain, do you suppose?" 
</P>
<P>
"You'll get two," Fisher says. "You'll have an extra one." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll give it to you if I do," Reynolds says sweetly. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, thank you. Then I'll have a headache. I think you should have made them 
give you more drugs." 
</P>
<P>
When Reynolds women, a particularly strong, upfront breed, get together, 
conversation instantly becomes dialogue. "On holidays," Fisher says, "I said 
the women were so potent that there was not enough oxygen, you just had to 
breathe less. The dynamic was so powerful." 
</P>
<P>
And when it comes to sheer impact, Fisher places Maxene at the top of the 
generational pile. "She came and visited the set of 'Postcards' and as she left 
she said to Gene Hackman and Mike Nichols, 'It's still as boring now as it was 
four years ago.' And then she said to me as we were going through the door, 
'Well, I didn't want them to think I was thrilled.' " 
</P>
<P>
If the snappy comeback is Fisher's forte, she comes by it honestly. Repartee 
was the main course at the family dinner table when Fisher was growing up, the 
subject of intense public scrutiny. When, in one of Hollywood's most notorious 
divorces, her father left his mother for Elizabeth Taylor, Fisher was only 2. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher was an intense, observant child weaned on a diet of old movies and 
books. She began scribbling poetry and prose in journals, which are now piled 
in Debbie Reynolds' garage. In fact, when her mother punished her, Fisher had 
little else to do. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Fisher's youthful musings took on a curious form. When she was 14 or 
so, she put pen to paper to instruct her mother on how she should manage her 
life, weighed down as it was by money and marital woes during her second 
marriage, to shoe magnate Harry Karl. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds later returned the favor. When Fisher dropped out of Beverly Hills 
High School in the 11th grade, Reynolds suggested -- strongly -- that Fisher 
bag her plan to perform in nightclubs and attend drama school in London. Fisher 
says it was the last fight she ever had with her mother. Her mother won. And as 
things turned out, mother was right. 
</P>
<P>
"I regard that as the one time in my life where I was part of a group, and I 
was happy to do that," Fisher says. "I think that's also why I also like those 
est things. Everything I grew up around is about being noticed, doing things on 
a grander scale. I like being a necessary part of a group, which is my 
background peeking through, but part of a group. I like being mayor of a 
group." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher made her film debut at 17 as the precocious nymphet to Warren Beatty's 
promiscuous hairdresser in "Shampoo." Soon she was plucked to play the part of 
Princess Leia in "Star Wars," a role that gave her the dubious but notable 
opportunity to sport "insane-asylum" hair. She recently returned from Minnesota 
for the filming of "Drop Dead Fred." Ever the "Eve Arden character," she plays 
Phoebe Cate's best friend. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, she was keeping track of things in her journals, treating her 
bigger-than-life life as though it were a screenplay. The opening line of 
"Surrender the Pink" -- "Dinah Kaufman lost her virginity a total of three 
times" -- came from entries Fisher jotted down when she was 18. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher lived in New York in her early 20s, joining the "Saturday Night Live" 
crew and through them, hooking up with Paul Simon. Like the alliance between 
the fictitious Dinah and her ex-husband Rudy, Fisher's relationship with Simon 
lasted seven years, less than one of which they spent as troubled husband and 
wife. Still, Fisher says that the self-absorbed and disturbingly certain Rudy 
is a composite of strong men who are in her life in various capacities -- 
Simon, Don Henley, Richard Dreyfuss, producer Dan Melnick. And, Fisher says, 
unlike Dinah, she never hid in her lover's closet, a spy in the house of love, 
the pathetic observer of her ex's happily nested new state. And yet there is a 
strong emotional resemblance between Fisher and her soap-opera writing 
counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
"I always feel that I've been a disappointing partner in a relationship because 
I'm on the phone too much and I don't pay a lot of attention. I always say, 'If 
you go out with me expecting to get a lot of homemade food, I offer another 
service, which is that I like to talk and I like exchanges and I like the 
contact made through communication . . . and my veal piccata is suffering 
because of that.' So anybody that I'd be with, you'd see them starved and 
overstimulated and their shirts are wrinkled. I'm just another kind of 
companion." 
</P>
<P>
That conventional way to be female, which Fisher somehow thinks she lacks, is 
the "pink" of the title. It also has a vaguely unmentionable meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher's New York years were her wild and crazy and druggy years, when the only 
thing people could count on about her was that she would get loaded, years when 
she would scout out medicine chests in a hunt for prescription drugs as a 
self-styled "Robin Hood -- I'd rob from the rich and give to the potentially 
stoned." 
</P>
<P>
Her problem, she says, was in part her hyperactive mind, which insisted on 
providing Cliffs Notes to everything she was experiencing. "I will tell myself 
nine stories about what I'm looking at. It's a way of orienting myself. It can 
be fine because I'm never bored, but you can't turn it off so when it fastens 
itself on the negative, it's less pleasant. My drug thing was, if I tell seven 
stories about every situation, it was to take it down to maybe a three." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Fisher blames her Hollywood upbringing. "I think there are certain 
people born a certain way. I was always an upset kid and my brother was not. 
Same childhood. Same parents. Same setup. My thought on this is, it's not what 
you're given. It's how you take it and what you do with what you're given. And 
what I did with what I was given is I was upset by it. In part. And what I did 
about that was make jokes. So I'm funnier than my brother but he's never ended 
up in an emergency room." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher did, which is where both the book and film versions of "Postcards" 
begin. While the 1987 book is heavy on the drug rehab experience, the film, 
under Nichols' hand, went on to explore the conflict between mothers and 
daughters, a mission that prompted Nichols and Fisher to study the generational 
clash in Ingmar Bergman's "Autumn Sonata." 
</P>
<P>
In Fisher's film, the mother, Doris, is always right and yet is fraught with 
weaknesses herself, as much a boozer as the daughter, Suzanne, is a druggie. 
Still, Doris is not too shy to deliver her stinging insights: "I came from 
nowhere and made something out of my life. You came from somewhere and are 
making nothing out of yours." 
</P>
<P>
Says Fisher: "Most lives are, in part, some kind of an odyssey away from where 
you originated. But in my life, I started where I wanted to end up potentially. 
And someone once suggested to me in one of these workshop things that my drug 
addiction was a form of initiation back into rich and famous." 
</P>
<P>
After Fisher completed rehab in five years ago, she became a former addict with 
a vengeance, or, as she likes to say, "Joan of Narc, patron saint of the 
addict. I said if I lived with the Pope, I would have thought he had an alcohol 
problem because he drank that wine every day." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, when it was suggested that Fisher go on lithium, she refused. "When 
they told me not to take drugs, I took them. They they told me to take 
something, and I was, 'I don't think so.' To me, it's another way of being 
truant." 
</P>
<P>
A truant, maybe, but mostly in her heart and mind. Fisher is doing very well 
for herself from her base above Beverly Hills, in a fancifully furnished, 
Southwestern-style three-bedroom ranch that once belonged to David Soul. She 
shares it with plastic cows, "Hairdryer Head" -- her name for one of her 
paintings, Buddy the dog and Joan and Dean, two parrots who live in "the bird 
zone," from which they loudly and often broadcast "the radio show from Venus." 
Her current boyfriend is an agent for Creative Artists Agency. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it's a pretty good gig. And there seems to be no end in sight. So 
maybe Fisher's modus operandi -- "good anecdote, bad reality" -- is giving rise 
to a reality that really isn't half bad. Why, she might even grow up to be like 
one of her heroes, the Dorothy Parker of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Look at it this way: "My skin can break out like it is now, and I don't have to 
worry about retaining fluids. You can't grow old gracefully in Hollywood. You 
can't grow old at all. See how many women tell their age after a certain age. 
Women I know are lying about it at 30, starting to counting backwards. Whereas 
men never have to. As a writer, I can be 33." Or, for that matter, 34. Or 35 or 
36. . . . After all, to use a Fisher-ism, "It's never too late to have a happy 
childhood."
