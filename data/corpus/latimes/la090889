NEWSMAKERS: HONESTY'S NOT ALWAYS THE POLICY

 -- If Diogenes were afoot in Columbus, Ohio, he would probably have been 
amused. The Greek cynic, reputed to have gone with a lamp at high noon in 
search of an honest man, would have found "Take an Honest Look," a project 
aimed at improving the city's sense of ethics. Headed by Jeb Stuart Magruder, a 
convicted Watergate conspirator who is now a Presbyterian minister, the 
program, begun last January, has had mixed results. Statistically, the city's 
crime rate is up 8.2%, with murder and manslaughter up 20.5%, said Harold 
Wilson, police crime prevention coordinator. On the other hand, said Magruder, 
he is pleased by individual acts of honesty: "We had a woman return five bags 
of lottery tickets she found, and someone returned $100 that wasn't his from an 
automatic teller machine at the airport. And a woman from Ft. Wayne, Ind., who 
stayed in a local hotel left an envelope behind with cash in it. She forgot 
about it until she got home, then was delighted to find that somebody turned it 
in."

 -- George Miller, 66, a retired statistics professor from Bellevue, Wash., has 
been irking Miss America Pageant officials for a decade, ever since he began 
feeding numbers into his computer and predicting -- sometimes days ahead of 
time -- the winner. He got it right five of 10 times. Miller first began having 
trouble when the pageant, bowing to feminist demands, stopped releasing 
contestant bust, hip and waist measurements. Then, calling Miller a "pain in 
the neck," pageant director Leonard Horn ordered other statistics such as 
weight and height withheld. The perfect candidate, according to Miller, is 21, 
stands 5-8, weighs 116 pounds, is blond with green eyes and hails from 
Mississippi or a large state.

 -- Cath Tschirn of King George, Va., will say her wedding vows with Richard 
Thomas on Saturday, and it will be the first time in five years that she will 
have stood up in public. Tschirn was injured in a car accident in 1984 and has 
been confined to a wheelchair. But members of the Virginia Chapter of 
Volunteers for Medical Engineering have built the woman, 20, a special stand to 
hold herself up and a turntable device to enable her to turn and greet the 
congregation. The volunteer engineers, with 400 members in 12 chapters, have 
donated a number of inventions to immobilized people around the country. The 
group was founded by John Staehlin, a Baltimore defense engineer who "heard a 
sermon on using your talents." TOM DURKIN

JESSIE MAE BEAVERS; HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSIONER, SENTINEL EDITOR, ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Jessie Mae Beavers, who as a girl spent her summers in segregated camps but 
grew up to become a quiet yet forceful activist in one of the nation's most 
integrated cities, died Wednesday of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year member of Los Angeles' Human Relations Commission who edited the 
family section of the Los Angeles Sentinel, a black-oriented newspaper, for 
many years was 68 when she died at Good Samaritan Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Beavers, who wrote for the Sentinel under her maiden name of Brown, came 
to maturity in this city when the YWCA scheduled separate weeks at camp for its 
black members. When she enrolled at UCLA a few years later, blacks were not 
allowed to live on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Yet she said those experiences left her not bitter but determined. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just glad I'd been accepted (at UCLA)," she said in an interview four 
years ago. After UCLA, where she majored in sociology, she went to work for the 
state's then premier black newspaper, the California Eagle, moving to the 
Sentinel in 1948 where she remained until her death. She was an unsuccessful 
candidate for the 10th District City Council seat in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
She helped organize the local chapter of the National Assn. of Media Women and 
the Black Women's Forum, worked for the Children's Home Society, the NAACP, 
conducted workshops at the request of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, served in 
Maureen Reagan's delegation to the International Conference of Women in Africa 
and interviewed nearly all of the black and many of the white political leaders 
of her day. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley named her to the city Human Relations Commission early in his 
Administration, and on Thursday the mayor remembered her as "one of the 
thousand points of light in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who had appointed her to the Los Angeles Music and 
Performing Arts Commission, said Mrs. Beavers "not only cared about her 
community, but she got involved in making Los Angeles a better place for all 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include her husband, Leroy Beavers Sr., a son and two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service is scheduled Monday at 10 a.m. at the Second Baptist Church, 
2412 Griffith Ave.

GYM MEMBERS DON'T WANT EXERCISE IN THE PARKING LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cesar Galvez gets an eight-hour workout at his gym without lifting a barbell or 
setting foot on a treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
He gets his exercise at a West Los Angeles physical fitness center by doing the 
running for others who have come to use the health spa's exercise machines. 
</P>
<P>
Galvez, 22, sprints up to seven miles a day parking and retrieving cars for 
athletic club members so they do not have to walk to or from one of the gym's 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
The sight of the club members standing around in sweats, gym shorts and 
training shoes while the shirt-and-tie clad valets run back and forth for their 
cars is amusing to many who travel past the Sepulveda Boulevard workout center. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have to chuckle when I see them," said lawyer Lisa Volpe, a New York 
transplant who lives in Reseda and passes the area on her way to visit friends. 
"It so silly. It's ludicrous. It's as if walking isn't exercise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to 17 Hours a Day 
</P>
<P>
Twenty valet parking attendants tend an unending line of Porsches and sporty 
Mercedes-Benz convertibles that pull up carrying doctors, lawyers, 
entertainment executives and others eager to tone up muscles and sweat off flab 
at the Sports Club/LA. 
</P>
<P>
Valets are on duty up to 17 hours a day. They race to four parking lots outside 
the gym while club members inside are using such equipment as electronically 
controlled exercise bikes and a special jogging track. 
</P>
<P>
Gym members who spend up to $1,900 to join and $135 a month to use the club say 
the valet idea is not as bizarre as it looks. 
</P>
<P>
"Time is money," said Reja Sabet, a Century City stockbroker. "If you only have 
an hour and a half to work out, you don't want to spend 15 minutes walking to 
and from your car." 
</P>
<P>
Nanette James, of Bel-Air, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're late for a private training session and are paying the guy 50 bucks 
an hour, a dollar or so for valet parking is not much," James said. 
</P>
<P>
Gym members who sweat through such professionally planned exercise routines do 
not want to deal afterward with the regimen of hunting for their cars in a 
six-level self-parking garage that is available for club members, said David 
Limor, a real estate investment company owner from Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"After an hour and a half of cardiovascular work, weights and stretching 
exercises, you feel good. But you're thinking about getting home, and that's 
all," Limor said, climbing into his white Porsche. "If all you want is 
exercise, you could run around your house." 
</P>
<P>
The members' garage requires tight turns, added Brentwood lawyer Pat Delchop 
with a grin as he waited for his black BMW. "If someone else dings it getting 
it out of the lot, I can sue them. If I do it, I can't." 
</P>
<P>
Even club members who park their own cars say they appreciate the valets, who 
are paid $5 per hour and split all tips among themselves at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, for the people who use the valet parking, their time is a little more 
valuable than mine at the moment," said Alyson Stover, a television network 
film acquisition assistant who lives in Century City. She said she parks on the 
street during her five-times-a-week gym visits. 
</P>
<P>
Not all visitors walk away enthusiastic about all the pampering, however. Not 
even those who use the valet service and do not have to actually walk away. 
</P>
<P>
"This wouldn't go over in San Diego where we live, I'll tell you," said Susan 
Lapidus, who visited the club as a perk that came with her stay at a Bel-Air 
hotel. Lapidus found the valets and other club amenities a bit excessive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's L.A., I guess," added her husband, attorney Robert Lapidus.

COMMITTEE OKS LOAN FOR S.D. OLYMPIC TRAINING SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's quest to cash in on the Olympic dream received a major boost 
Thursday when a key state Assembly committee agreed to lend $15 million in 
public funds toward building a year-round Olympic training center in the South 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, sponsored by state Sen. Bill Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), 
received the bare majority of 12 votes required to pass the Assembly's Ways and 
Means Committee, over the objections of the panel's powerful chairman that the 
$15-million transaction was tantamount to a "giveaway." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's bill would lend $15 million from the general fund to the private, 
nonprofit San Diego National Sports Training Foundation to help build a 
$70-million all-season Olympic training facility on 154 acres west of the Lower 
Otay Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scattered Sniping 
</P>
<P>
The bill has been the subject of scattered legislative sniping because it does 
not require the private foundation to pay back the money. Instead, it calls for 
the public funds to be replenished through the sale of personalized Olympic 
Training Center license plates, at $100 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Ways and Means 
Committee, criticized the personalized license plate scheme as unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
His criticism was based on a Department of Motor Vehicles analysis that 
estimated that such license plate sales would bring in $1 million during the 
first two years, but only $100,000 annually after that -- a scenario that would 
require 142 years for the state to recoup its $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no repayment provision, and it would take 200 years to repay the 
loan. . . . It's just a giveaway," Vasconcellos said at Thursday's hearing. "I 
won't be here then to make sure that it happens." 
</P>
<P>
But Campbell countered by saying that the DMV estimate was misguided because it 
was based on the $2 million in sales of specialized license plates for the 1984 
Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games. The 1984 license plate sales fell flat 
because they were not promoted, said Campbell, who was president of the 
Coliseum Commission during the Los Angeles games. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be significantly promoted," Campbell told The Times in an interview 
before the hearing. "Now we're going to go out and get significant public 
service announcements working to sell the plates, and you'll have a group of 
people who will also be out there to promote it -- all the Olympic athletes in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the financial objections, the political issues surrounding the bill 
also raised some eyebrows around the state capital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers Surprised 
</P>
<P>
Some San Diego lawmakers said they were surprised that Campbell, whose district 
lies miles north in Los Angeles and Orange counties, was contacted by the San 
Diego officials to carry the bill. One of the training center's most public 
proponents is San Diego City Councilwoman Gloria McColl. 
</P>
<P>
"I continue to be surprised," said state Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego). "I 
don't know why the councilwoman would have gone around the San Diego 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed that she did, obviously," said Stirling. "We wanted to be 
helpful and involved." 
</P>
<P>
But foundation director David Nielsen said Campbell was enlisted for the job 
after he received a glowing referral from a member of the state's Department of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic Backer 
</P>
<P>
McColl said Campbell enthusiastically took up the foundation's cause. "He came 
down and asked us about the program," said the councilwoman. "He was very 
enthusiastic and was interested in the benefits of it for Californians and the 
youth." 
</P>
<P>
McColl has spearheaded the drive to build an all-season training center for 
Olympic athletes as a way to provide wholesome models for San Diego youth. The 
center, which has received the blessing of the U. S. Olympic Committee, is also 
expected to provide an economic boon to the South Bay area near Chula Vista 
where residential and commercial development is strong. 
</P>
<P>
The EastLake Development Co., a partnership that includes the politically 
powerful J.G. Boswell Co. agribusiness firm of Los Angeles, has already agreed 
to donate 154 acres overlooking the Otay reservoir. The training center site is 
also contiguous to the former Otay Ranch, which was recently purchased by the 
Baldwin company, a large Orange County development firm. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen said plans call for the construction of 250,000 square feet of 
buildings on the site, including a 300-bed dormitory, with about 1.5 million 
square feet of outdoor training areas. The foundation hopes to break ground 
next spring and complete construction in 18 months -- in time to start training 
for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$7 Million in Pledges 
</P>
<P>
So far, said Nielsen, the foundation has received about $7 million in private 
pledges and will receive $1.2 million of that by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the foundation is hoping to raise at least $50 million from the private 
sector, an amount that includes the $13-million donation of land and 
infrastructure -- streets, sewers, drains -- from EastLake Development. 
</P>
<P>
Because the total project is expected to cost $70 million, Nielsen said the 
state's $15 million is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen said that Thursday's action by the Assembly committee made him "very, 
very happy," and he added that he "felt very badly" about the criticisms voiced 
by Vasconcellos. Nielsen said the foundation will be supplying more information 
to buttress its assertion that specialized license plate sales will be brisker 
than the DMV expects. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's bill now goes to the full Assembly for approval. It must pass 
through the Legislature before lawmakers break for the year next Friday for the 
money to be sent to the foundation this year.

A TEST CASE OF NEW SYSTEM'S IMPACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before deciding to run for office, most candidates carefully assess their own 
strengths and weaknesses, gauge their opponents' potential liabilities, ponder 
issues and total up myriad other subjects on a kind of political balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
John Hartley, a real estate broker who hopes to unseat San Diego City 
Councilwoman Gloria McColl, spent weeks going through that mental exercise 
before entering the 3rd District race. However, even earlier, Hartley focused 
his energies on another endeavor more integral to his chances in the Sept. 19 
primary: He changed the rules of the game, helping to create a new election 
system that significantly improves the chances of any challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Having led last fall's successful battle for district-only council races, 
Hartley now hopes to capitalize on that critical structural change in the 
city's elections in his campaign against McColl and businessman Charles 
Ulmschneider. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more so than any of the three other council races on this month's 
ballot, the 3rd District contest is widely regarded as a case study of the 
political impact of the switch from the city's former two-tiered election 
format, in which district primaries were followed by citywide runoffs between 
the top two vote-getters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unassailable in Citywide Race 
</P>
<P>
In form and content, the campaign in McColl's Mid-City district features many 
elements that will provide a practical political test of the questions debated 
in theory during last fall's Proposition E campaign on the relative merits of 
district and at-large elections. 
</P>
<P>
With the considerable name-recognition and fund-raising advantages that come 
with 6 1/2 years of incumbency, the 58-year-old McColl probably would be 
politically unassailable in a citywide contest, her opponents concede. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a district election, a candidate's dogged persistence can 
effectively compensate for a lack of funds and a well-known name. A tireless 
door-to-door campaigner, Hartley hopes to prove an argument commonly offered by 
proponents of district elections -- namely, that, in a district geographically 
compact enough to be covered by foot in a six-month campaign, an aggressive 
grass-roots organization, combined with simmering neighborhood discontent, can 
be more potent than 30-second TV and radio ads and a huge campaign bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
"This race really lays all those pro and con arguments about district elections 
on the line," said Hartley, a 46-year-old Normal Heights resident who lost to 
McColl in a 1983 council race. "When this is over, the political analysts will 
have a field day." 
</P>
<P>
For Hartley, the challenge posed by the primary is whether, having changed the 
rules governing council elections, he can now win the game. 
</P>
<P>
As the coordinator of Neighborhoods for District elections, he led the fight 
that resulted in last November's razor-thin 51.1% approval of the district-only 
ballot proposition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'New Breed of Challengers' 
</P>
<P>
"If that hadn't passed, John still might have run, but he wouldn't have been a 
viable citywide candidate," said Tom Shepard, Hartley's campaign consultant. 
</P>
<P>
However, the visibility that Hartley gained in last fall's campaign, combined 
with years of activism in a wide range of business and community groups within 
the district, has caused him to be perceived -- partly through self-promotion 
of the image -- as a standard-bearer for what he himself describes as "a new 
breed of challengers" emboldened by the city's new election system. 
</P>
<P>
McColl, though, has also quickly adjusted to the changed political realities. 
Since being appointed to the seat in 1983, she has compiled a long list of 
accomplishments -- ranging from community cleanup programs and acquisition of 
100 acres of parks to a well-publicized crackdown on prostitution on El Cajon 
Boulevard -- in neighborhoods throughout the district, which includes East San 
Diego, North Park, Kensington, Normal Heights, University Heights, City 
Heights, Oak Park, North Encanto, Rolando, Redwood and Chollas. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even before the advent of district-only elections narrowed council 
members' perspectives to their own districts, McColl boasted of her success in 
guaranteeing that the 3rd District consistently received its fair share of city 
services and funding. At candidate forums, she proudly notes, her district was 
untouched during recent budget cuts at City Hall, and she emphasizes that its 
share of federal redevelopment funds increased from 1% to 33% during her 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
In a citywide election, sidewalk repairs in one neighborhood or sprucing up the 
business district in another would be relatively minor factors. But, in a 
district race, such accomplishments in one's own political back yard become 
pivotal, and dozens of them have left McColl with strong backing from many 
community leaders throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
The change to district-only races, however, also brings with it some potential 
liabilities for McColl, who failed to carry her district in her 1983 citywide 
victory over Bob Filner -- a race in which Hartley finished a distant third 
with only 9.5% of the vote. In particular, Democrats hold a commanding 55%-33% 
registration edge in the 3rd District, a significant concern for Republican 
McColl in a race against Democrat Hartley that is nonpartisan more in theory 
than in fact. 
</P>
<P>
Although she exudes serene confidence, McColl has waged an aggressive, at times 
bare-knuckles campaign laced with personal attacks on Hartley. Although her 
campaign manager, Marla Marshall, argues that the no-holds-barred style is 
indicative of nothing more than the fact that "Gloria always runs scared," 
others have suggested that McColl's renewed vigor stems from unpleasant 
memories of a bitter 1988 loss to Carol Bentley in a state Assembly race that 
she had begun as a prohibitive favorite. 
</P>
<P>
In a campaign in which the front-runners' mutual disdain has never been 
disguised, one of the few areas of agreement between McColl and Hartley is that 
the election is likely to be settled in the primary, with the victor surpassing 
the 50% margin needed to avoid a November runoff. With Ulmschneider, a long 
shot who received only 3.6% of the vote in last year's mayoral race, expected 
to draw a similarly negligible share of the primary vote, a conclusive win by 
either McColl or Hartley appears statistically and politically probable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crime the Chief Concern 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of the campaign, the candidates have spent much of their 
time debating whether crime, which polls confirm as 3rd District voters' chief 
concern, and growth problems have worsened or been reined in during McColl's 1 
1/2 terms at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
From Hartley's perspective, the 3rd District is a "less safe, more congested, 
more troubled" community than it was before McColl took office, an argument 
that he supports by pointing to Police Department figures showing that crime 
there has increased at twice the citywide rate since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"It's reached an epidemic stage where people literally are afraid to go out of 
their homes, especially at night," said Hartley, who has called for a drug and 
gang hot line, expansion of the Neighborhood Watch program and more youth 
recreational services to help combat the problem. "And it's not just older 
people who feel that way. Beyond all the usual stuff -- vandalism, break-ins, 
muggings -- there's growing drug and gang problems. McColl pretends that the 
problem doesn't exist or is getting better, but the statistics show that's not 
so." 
</P>
<P>
Disputing her opponent's claims as "evidence that, once again, Mr. Hartley is 
ill-informed," McColl counters by citing another statistic showing that crime 
in her district decreased 8% from 1988 during the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there was a time when crime was increasing faster here than the rest of 
the city," said McColl, whose endorsement by the Police Officers Assn. allows 
her to bill herself as "Law Enforcement's Choice." 
</P>
<P>
"But now we've hired more police and created more programs, and that trend has 
been reversed," said McColl, who chairs the council's Public Services and 
Safety Committee, a post she claims has helped her gain the ear of Police Chief 
Bob Burgreen. "For this man to suggest otherwise is an insult to me and the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Part of the Bulldozer Brigade' 
</P>
<P>
On growth, Hartley has caustically characterized McColl as "part of the 
bulldozer brigade," calling her "one of developers' best friends on the 
council" and contending that nearly 90% of the $168,000 she had raised as of 
last month, more than four times his own contribution total, came from 
development interests. 
</P>
<P>
In response, McColl emphasizes her success in down-zoning areas throughout the 
district in an effort to preserve single-family neighborhoods and to ensure 
that multi-unit projects are concentrated along major transportation corridors. 
</P>
<P>
"District 3 was a victim of the city's growth-management plan of the 1970s 
because it encouraged in-fill in existing, Mid-City communities," McColl said. 
"We were park-deficient and infrastructure-deficient. But that, too, is no 
longer the case. Now the district is getting the services and funding it needs. 
As with so many of his other charges, my opponent seems to be wrong or living 
in the past on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
In attempting to deflect Hartley's criticisms on the growth issue, McColl has 
also received some unexpected help from Ulmschneider, who notes wryly, "It 
seems a little strange to me for someone who's a real estate broker to point a 
finger at someone else over too much development." 
</P>
<P>
As those comments indicate, even when the candidates debate issues, the 
dialogue has had a tendency to turn personal in the 3rd District race. That has 
been particularly true of the McColl campaign, which, in seeking to raise 
questions about Hartley's character while simultaneously turning the crime 
issue back upon him, sent out a mailer last month stating that Hartley broke 
the law "three times . . . in less than one year" in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deliberately Vague About Infractions 
</P>
<P>
Although photocopies of Hartley's citations were printed on the cover, 
descriptions of the specific infractions were deliberately vague, as in: 
"Candidate Hartley is cited for a criminal violation, code 33 1402." Marked in 
bold red ink, the mailer concluded: "We can't afford to have a lawbreaker be a 
lawmaker. Say NO to candidate Hartley." 
</P>
<P>
What the mailer did not specify is that the "crime" for which Hartley had 
received minor fines involved selling lobsters from a pickup truck without 
proper permits, an offense that one police spokesman dismissed as "less 
important than a parking ticket." The citations occurred while Hartley worked 
for a fish company, one of several part-time jobs he held during downturns in 
the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
In response to another McColl offensive questioning his academic credentials, 
Hartley was forced to acknowledge that he had changed his name from Bill Terry 
Glendenning to John Terry Hartley in 1973. Hartley insists he changed his name 
"not because there's something sinister in my past I'm trying to hide," but 
rather to honor his maternal grandfather, who died of cancer that year. 
McColl's strategists, however, have done their best to raise eyebrows over that 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue isn't lobsters," McColl said when asked why such questions have been 
injected into the campaign. "The issue is a person's willingness to follow the 
laws of the land. This goes to the question of character. We look to our public 
officials to set examples. But what kind of example can someone who breaks the 
law himself set?" 
</P>
<P>
When not laughing off McColl's criticisms, Hartley optimistically points to 
them as "signs of serious desperation" on her part. However, he concedes that 
some voters might regard name changes and lobster-selling convictions as, if 
nothing else, rather quirky inclusions on a candidate's resume. In his defense, 
though, Hartley paints himself as a kind of political Everyman and, in the 
process, takes another swipe at McColl. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Not Perfect' 
</P>
<P>
"I guess, if it shows anything, it shows that, like most people, I'm not 
perfect," Hartley said. "I'm a fairly typical, middle-class, working-class type 
of person. I've had my share of problems. But life is how you deal with those 
problems, and I've never given up. 
</P>
<P>
"In that regard, I think I'm a lot closer to the people in this district than 
McColl. She lives in a big house on the most exclusive street in Kensington 
behind a private security fence. Maybe the reason she doesn't think crime is 
such a big problem is that she doesn't have the same kind of experiences the 
rest of us do." 
</P>
<P>
Ulmschneider, meanwhile, has been treated as little more than a political 
footnote in the contest. While he complains that his opponents largely ignore 
him as "a minor nuisance," by conventional political yardsticks, there appears 
to be little reason to assign Ulmschneider any greater significance. 
</P>
<P>
Labeling himself "the populist alternative," he acknowledges that his $6,000 
campaign budget means he will be heavily outgunned by both of his opponents -- 
an all but insurmountable financial disadvantage even in a district race. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a little tough being a candidate, campaign manager, political 
consultant, treasurer and public relations director all wrapped up in one," 
Ulmschneider conceded. 
</P>
<P>
A 35-year-old North Park newspaper distributor, Ulmschneider says that what 
most distinguishes him from Hartley and McColl is that "I'm not receiving a 
dime from any special interests." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, as far as Ulmschneider's admittedly slim chances are concerned, 
that situation is not entirely of his own making, being more a reflection of 
his long-shot status than a deliberate effort to stake out the moral high 
ground in the campaign. As a result, Ulmschneider's potential influence in the 
race appears to be limited to perhaps forcing a runoff by siphoning off enough 
votes to keep both McColl and Hartley below the 50% threshold.

POPULATION BOOM BOOSTS SAN DIEGO AREA TO NO. 17 IN NATION, CENSUS BUREAU SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego metropolitan area has added more than half-a-million residents in 
the 1980s, representing one of the fastest growth rates nationwide, the Census 
Bureau reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The population boom has vaulted the city past Pittsburgh and Baltimore in the 
last year, making San Diego the 17th largest metropolitan area in the country, 
according to the Census Bureau's annual estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the population of San Diego and its suburbs rose 509,000 (27.3%) since 
the start of the decade, including an increase of 84,100 residents from 1987 to 
1988. Among large metropolitan areas, only Phoenix, Dallas, and Atlanta grew 
faster, with the Phoenix population increasing by 34.5% since 1980, the most in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego Greater Chamber of Commerce official welcomed the news. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a confirmation that San Diego is a rapidly growing area," said Max 
Schetter, the chamber's research director. "People are coming here because of 
the jobs and the things to do here, the opportunity, the strong economy." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's population has been growing at 4% annually, contrasted with 2% for 
California and 1% for the United States, Schetter said. Last year's increase, 
the highest since 1950, was likely the largest ever in peacetime, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But Schetter also cautioned that the boom is unlikely to continue because of 
inadequate road and sewer networks, and high housing prices. "I would be 
surprised if (growth) stayed at that rate much longer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The annual survey examined 283 metropolitan areas, each an urban region with 
its own local economy, according to Census Bureau spokeswoman Cheryl Chambers. 
But Schetter complained that the Census Bureau's count stopped at the 
international border, excluding Tijuana and its estimated 1.5 million residents 
from the San Diego metropolitan area.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORE EFFORTS TO FIGHT JAIL EXPANSION URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four Los Angeles City Council members on Tuesday proposed asking the city 
attorney's office to explore ways to oppose the planned expansion of the 
downtown Men's Central Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors, on a 3-1 vote Aug. 29, approved the 2,408-bed 
expansion increasing the facility's capacity to 9,000 inmates. The plan was 
opposed by Asian and Hispanic area residents, who said the neighborhoods from 
Chinatown to East Los Angeles are already overloaded with jail facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre, who represents the Eastside 14th District, 
proposed asking the city attorney to investigate what legal options are open to 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Gloria Molina, Michael Woo and Gilbert Lindsay, who all 
represent areas near the jail, seconded the motion. The motion will be 
considered by the council Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed expansion includes plans to build a two-story inmate reception 
center sided by two concrete towers, seven and eight stories high. There will 
also be a five-story tower at the back of the complex, which will house a jail 
hospital.

<P>
He was Hollywood's version of King Tut. And now he's the subject of a book, 
"The Career of Elmer McCurdy, Deceased." 
</P>
<P>
The woebegone bandit was killed after an Oklahoma train robbery in 1911. When 
no one claimed McCurdy's body, a carnival owner took him on the road. He led a 
quiet nonexistence until 1976, when a scene for the television series, "The Six 
Million Dollar Man," was being prepared in a fun house attraction at the old 
Pike amusement park in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A technician tried to move what was billed as a wax dummy but pulled off a real 
arm. It was Elmer. 
</P>
<P>
Dodge City, Kan., author Richard Basgall relates how McCurdy was eventually 
identified with the help of far-flung carnival ticket stubs found in the 
badman's throat. Spectators had apparently stuffed them in there over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Once Elmer's story got out, Oklahoma authorities were inundated with requests 
from newspapers around the world for photos of McCurdy. L.A. radio talk show 
host Bud Furillo printed up T-shirts that said, "Elmer McCurdy, 1869-1911," on 
the front, and "Elmer McCurdy, 1911-1976," on the back. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the urging of Fred Olds, director of the Oklahoma Territorial 
Museum, McCurdy was returned the next year to Guthrie, Okla., for burial with 
some other bad guys in that town's Boot Hill. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken Basgall 13 years to write the book. But Elmer's used to long 
waits. 
</P>
<P>
"More evidence of the tightening job market," says Jim Foy, executive director 
of the Greater Los Angeles Press Club, who contributes the following: 
</P>
<P>
An ad for a "Stage Laborer," published in a Hollywood trade publication, states 
that the duties include the "ability to perform heavy physical labor." 
</P>
<P>
The ad concludes: "Bachelor's degree preferred." 
</P>
<P>
Here's one set of civic rankings where Los Angeles will happily take a back 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Angels ranked 37th in the nation in motor vehicle thefts per 
100,000 residents in 1988. The National Automobile Theft Bureau reports that 
57,331 vehicles were stolen in L.A. (about 1 per 1,700 people). 
</P>
<P>
Newark, N.J., was No. 1. The car-thief capital of Southern California -- 
ranking No. 9 overall -- was Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Yorba Linda City Council has voted unanimously to direct its staff to 
prepare a resolution making the Jan. 9 birthday of native son Richard M. Nixon 
a city holiday. But the town of Whittier, where the former President grew up 
and attended college, has shown no inkling to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a fan of Nixon's," said Whittier City Councilman Myron 
Claxton. "But I think we have enough holidays as it is." 
</P>
<P>
If you can't get your fill of insects around the house, more than 20 species of 
bugs are on display at the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum. Live 
bugs. 
</P>
<P>
The stars include giant hercules beetles from Costa Rica, rhinoceros beetles 
from Arizona, tarantulas, scorpions and the headliners, Medflies donated by 
state agriculture authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry about a mass escape. The Medflies are sterile. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway commuters are only too used to hearing radio bulletins warning of 
jam-ups caused by another spill of some rig's big load. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the case on the Hollywood Freeway Thursday morning. Instead, 
southbound traffic was bunched up because drivers in the fast lane were 
swerving to avoid a sort of tiny load. 
</P>
<P>
It was a single license plate that had fallen on to the pavement, and somehow 
remained standing upright in its frame. 
</P>
<P>
Did anyone get the car of that license number?

SERIAL-ROBBERY TRIAL DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appeals court Thursday delayed the trial of a suspected serial robber who is 
charged with holding up cashiers in stores throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal delayed the trial of Paul William Bresney, 38, 
of San Diego so it can review a ruling by the trial judge before the trial gets 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells filed a writ with the appellate court after San 
Diego Superior Court Judge J. Perry Langford on Wednesday split up the 56 
charges against Bresney and ordered four separate trials. 
</P>
<P>
Langford ruled that Bresney be tried for 15 counts each at three trials, and 
then for 11 counts at the last trial. 
</P>
<P>
Bresney's lawyer, Charles Elliott, had successfully argued that bunching all of 
the cases together in one trial would be prejudicial to Bresney. 
</P>
<P>
Bresney is accused of being the "Walk to the Back" robber, who told his victims 
to go the back of the store he was holding up while he made his getaway. The 
robberies began Jan. 3 and continued into April. Bresney was arrested April 21. 
</P>
<P>
The order halting the trial came just as potential jurors were called to the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate justices are expected to review Langford's decision and make a 
ruling within a few weeks.

UNUSUALLY COOL SUMMER SLIDING INTO AUTUMN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cool and crisp conditions, unusual for San Diego in September, will prevail 
through the weekend, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Sun seekers need not worry, however, as days will become "pretty perfect" after 
the night-and-morning low clouds burn off, said forecaster Wilbur Shigehara. 
Temperatures and humidity levels slightly below the seasonal norm are turning 
peoples' thoughts to autumn, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the second to the last week of summer, and I'm talking to people who 
are already planning their fall crops," Shigehara said. "We have all these low 
pressures hanging around, making the weather what you might call perfect, but 
it's still unusual for summer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cool Summers Continue 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, this is the fourth year in a row we've had rather cool summers," 
Shigehara said. "This year, we were more than a whole degree below the norm for 
all of August . . . We just had a couple of warm spurts here and there." 
</P>
<P>
The recent low-pressure system originated in Canada and stalled over Southern 
California Wednesday, bringing down the 80-degree-plus weather of the Labor Day 
weekend sharply, Shigehara said. Also, as a result of this weather pattern, 
only minor temperature fluctuations are expected through the middle of next 
week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beach highs through the weekend will be 67 to 71, Shigehara said. The water 
temperature at Mission Beach is 61, and the surf is 2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Clouds Expected 
</P>
<P>
This broad low pressure trough is also responsible for the increase in 
night-and-morning low clouds along the coast, but afternoons should be pleasant 
and sunny, Shigehara said. Coastal highs are expected to range from 73 to 78 
through Sunday, and overnight lows in the mid-60s. 
</P>
<P>
Inland highs will hover in the low-80s. Lows will be from 55 to 62 tonight and 
Saturday, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
There will be some gusty afternoon and evening winds in the mountains, whipping 
up to 25 m.p.h. in places, but plenty of sunshine and clear nights are forecast 
through Sunday. Highs will range from 76 to 82 degrees and overnight lows will 
dip into the 40s. 
</P>
<P>
Desert highs will be between 100 and 105. Lows will be in the mid-70s.

<P>
Why do you make newspapers so boring for kids? Kids would like a section for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
There's too much junk like fires and accidents on the freeways in the 
newspaper. Kids would like a page on their own futures. Kids get tired of the 
stuff grown-ups like. Kids like toys, bikes and skateboards. 
</P>
<P>
Grown-ups like shopping for ugly stuff. Grown-ups like boring business books.

'SHELTER IMPERATIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("Shelter Imperative," Aug. 25) was underscored in the article 
by Penelope McMillan on the eviction of several disabled people, with very 
little notice and no relocation payments (Metro, Aug. 29). 
</P>
<P>
Though these tragedies must certainly be rectified, the crucial point of the 
article was that about 200 single-room-occupancy hotels have been torn down 
over the last 10 years, leaving only 273 remaining. This has resulted in a 
situation repeated throughout the nation, that of homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Your suggestion of a $7.50-per-square-foot fee on commercial construction to 
raise $75 million a year for housing would certainly be a help. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a problem of greater magnitude which must have federal support. The 
governmental hands-off approach to housing of the past nine years, coupled with 
an unnecessary military buildup, must be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of several hundred peace and justice organizations is sponsoring a 
walk on Washington on Oct. 7 with three demands: End homelessness, restore 
federal funding for low-income housing programs, and build permanent affordable 
housing, not shelter, for the homeless. Their cause is just and should be 
supported by all.

HUNTING BANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article "Drawing a Bead on Hunting" (Part I, Aug. 28) would lead readers to 
believe that the current effort to save the mountain lion is an anti-hunting 
campaign. Such is not the case. The California Wildlife Initiative, if passed 
by the voters in 1990, will not stop all hunting and is not intended to do so. 
</P>

The number of mountain lions left in California is unknown. No scientific study 
has been made to determine the number of these creatures left in our state. 
Until such a study is made it would seem prudent to stop the hunting of 
mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the initiative has provisions for the taking of lions which endanger 
people or kill rancher's livestock.

NO TURNING BACK NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no turning back in South Africa now. The ruling National Party has 
maintained control of Parliament in this week's elections, albeit with a 
drastically diminished majority, assuring Acting President Frederik W. de Klerk 
the votes to proceed with his promised reforms. Now must come the dialogue and 
then the action that will extend, at long last, political rights to the black 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
Enormous obstacles remain, not least the delicate task for De Klerk to 
translate his platitudes and ambiguities into an effective, meaningful program 
supported both by the majority in the white Parliament and by the black 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
That task will be made more difficult by the growth of the Conservative Party, 
which gained the most in this election, now holding 23% of the seats in 
Parliament to assert its hard-line commitment to a restoration, expansion and 
enforcement of apartheid. The task also will be made more difficult by violence 
on both sides -- the violence of security forces against peaceful 
demonstrations on the eve of this election, an excess if not abuse of power 
that raised troubling questions about the ability of De Klerk to control his 
own government, and the violence of blacks on election day. 
</P>
<P>
But the task will be facilitated by the extraordinary growth of the Democratic 
Party, firmly committed to ending apartheid if less than firmly committed to 
true democracy. That party gained 13 seats and now controls 20% of Parliament, 
which, added to the majority of the National Party, means that 75% of the seats 
belong to parties committed to do away with apartheid in one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the unity of the blacks, in their election day general strike that 
paralyzed much of the economy, and the virtual boycott by Indian and mixed-race 
voters of their separate parliamentary elections, served as a reminder to the 
white minority of the growing power in the ranks of the nonwhite majority. 
</P>
<P>
There will now be immediate tests of De Klerk's real intentions. His sincerity 
about dialogue will be tested, for example, by his willingness to release 
Nelson Mandela and other African National Congress leaders from imprisonment, 
to end the state of emergency and to restore political rights to the ANC and 
other opposition groups. Without those steps, there can be no dialogue, and to 
argue otherwise is to perpetuate a farce. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament itself has a long agenda to affirm a commitment to the profound 
changes implied in the National Party campaign statements. The highest priority 
is abandonment of the group areas act that enforces racism. De Klerk, like his 
predecessor, Pieter W. Botha, has insisted that apartheid is dead and that a 
new day is dawning in South Africa. That rhetoric has no meaning to the black 
majority, however, until it is translated into equal political and economic 
rights, the elements of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
The profound change to which De Klerk has said he is committed cannot come 
instantly. Even the Democratic Party, with its firmer commitment to end racism, 
argues the necessity of a time of transition and special protections for 
minority interests. But history has shown that the process now beginning in 
South Africa accelerates at its own pace, cannot always be controlled, and its 
end result cannot be neatly forecast. The prospects for constructive change are 
enhanced, and the risks of violent anarchy reduced, to the extent that those in 
power are able, as they begin to share power, to demonstrate respect for the 
wisdom unique to democratic institutions.

WITHOUT REFORM OF PRICES SOVIET ECONOMY CAN'T RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES WOLF JR., Charles Wolf Jr. directs RAND Corp. research on 
international economics and is dean of the RAND Graduate School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who believe that it is in the West's interests for Soviet economic 
reforms to succeed have misdirected their attention. 
</P>
<P>
They have proposed Western credits, direct investments, joint ventures, 
technology transfer, most-favored-nation benefits and Soviet participation in 
international economic organizations. But prospects for the success of 
perestroika do not depend on these instruments. Success instead depends on 
rapid price reform: moving speedily from reliance on administered prices toward 
market-determined ones. With price reform -- and regardless of Western help -- 
Soviet resource allocations will improve and output, productivity and living 
standards will rise. Without it, external help will be ineffectual. 
</P>
<P>
Administered prices reflect "priorities" and "social needs," as judged by 
central authorities -- ultimately, the criteria are political. Market prices 
reflect the choices of users and the costs to producers -- ultimately, the 
criteria are economic and technical. Administered prices frequently provide 
perverse incentives that lead to surpluses in some fields, shortages in others, 
waste of resources and deteriorating quality. These are the precise 
characteristics of the Soviet economy. Few have described them more starkly 
than Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev himself. Market prices, including 
the prices of labor and capital, provide positive incentives that generally 
lead to equalization of supply and demand (rather than shortages and 
surpluses), improved product quality and more efficient use of resources. 
</P>
<P>
These points about price reform and its effects are familiar and widely 
accepted by such Soviet economists as Nikolai Shmelyev, Abel Aganbegyian, 
Vasili Selyunin and others, no less than by most Western economists. The 
problem, and the disagreement, that arises at this point concerns "how to get 
there from here." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, there is a worry that severe inflation would be unleashed by a 
recourse to market-determined prices. This worry is based on a misunderstanding 
about the nature, causes and symptoms of inflation and its relation to price 
reform. And this misunderstanding, in turn, obscures a readily available remedy 
for the actual problems that rapid price reform would entail in a command 
economy like that of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation arises when there is an increasing quantity of money seeking to buy a 
relatively fixed or reduced supply of goods. Inflation comes in two variations: 
"demand-pull," in which an increase in money supply creates a gap between 
monetary demand and the unchanged supply of goods and services, resulting in 
price increases across-the-board; and "cost-push," in which nominal labor and 
other production costs begin to rise without a corresponding increase in 
productivity (and with an ensuing increase in the money supply to facilitate 
the initial cost increases). Once again, the result is pervasive and 
self-reinforcing price increases. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of these conditions accurately describes the circumstances associated 
with price reform in the Soviet Union. Moving from administered prices toward a 
market system doesn't in itself imply or generate an increase in the money 
supply, a diminished supply of goods or a rise in production costs. Hence, 
inflation is not the real problem to be feared. In the transition from 
administered to market prices, the real problem lies elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Under the existing Soviet system of administered prices combined with rationing 
of essential commodities, much of the currently earned income simply cannot be 
spent because the supply of goods is deficient -- both in quantity and quality. 
Hence, income that isn't spent accumulates as holdings of ruble cash or savings 
deposits. As a result, total holdings of cash and savings deposits are three or 
four times larger, in relation to Soviet gross national product, than the 
corresponding holdings in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, accumulations held by individuals are extremely large, 
having been amassed over many years. This presents a serious problem for an 
abrupt shift to market-determined prices, because these holdings could become 
active sources of monetary demand, boosting prices across the board, as well as 
resulting in major changes in relative prices among different commodities. 
</P>
<P>
The concern this creates is that, with the ensuing rise in market prices, the 
existing supply of goods -- especially consumer goods -- would be commandeered 
by holders of cash or deposits, resulting in distributional inequities, labor 
unrest and political stress. To the extent this concern is warranted, an 
effective remedy is readily at hand -- one that a command economy like that of 
the Soviet Union is singularly well-equipped to apply. 
</P>
<P>
The remedy lies in an immediate reform of the monetary system -- exchanging all 
large holdings (say, above 5,000 rubles) for long-term (say, 10 to 15 years) 
nontradable ruble bonds, and converting all small holdings of "old" rubles into 
"new" rubles. Such a monetary reform would enable price reform to succeed by 
sterilizing the bulk of the monetary overhang, allowing the market mechanism to 
determine relative commodity prices and providing enterprises with clear 
signals as to where and when to increase, decrease or terminate production. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, this proposal carries no implication concerning the state's 
continued production and provision of "socially necessary" output. Such 
production by and for the state would simply entail costs determined by market 
forces, would be purchased at market prices and would be financed by taxes or 
other revenues and endorsed by the Congress of People's Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The success of perestroika need not wait for an indefinite future. It is 
readily at hand if the Soviet leadership makes use of the state's power to move 
rapidly toward effective price reform.

HURRY UP, KIDS, AND LEARN A LIFE OF ANXIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN GOODMAN , Ellen Goodman is a syndicated columnist in Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The geese are overhead, flying south in V-formations as crisp as a sharpened 
pencil. We watched them from the porch in a Maine light transformed by 
September clarity. Now we follow their lead, proceeding on our own annual 
migration. 
</P>
<P>
The path we take also heads south, along parallel highway lines. We pass the 
exit to Kennebunkport where George Bush has spent his vacation in the 
presidential triathlon: fishing at 10, tennis at 11, horseshoes at noon. Within 
an hour of home, the roads become clogged with our own species: back-to-school, 
back-to-work creatures. 
</P>
<P>
With jars of wild blackberry jam wrapped carefully in T-shirts and towels, we 
are returning to the real world, although why we call it "real" I cannot tell 
you. Is reality hard-edged and harried while fantasy is soft and leisurely? Is 
the real world one of obligations and the fantasy world one of pleasures? 
</P>
<P>
Our migration takes only a few hours, but as we reach the city a familiar 
feeling comes out of its August hibernation. The rush that comes from being 
rushed. A lick of anxiety accompanies us through the traffic to the airport 
where, in some adult variation of the old car pool, I leave my once-child on 
her way back to college. 
</P>
<P>
And as I watch her, books, bags, guitar and all, the familiar watchword of the 
real world comes back into my mind: Hurry. The new year has begun. Hurry. 
</P>
<P>
This is what I associate with September as much as clean notebooks and new 
shoes. We learn all over again to trade our own rhythms for those of school and 
work and, in turn, we teach that to our children. 
</P>
<P>
In millions of homes there is the same sudden nagging jump-start to the year. 
It is the sound of our own voices commanding ourselves and our kids: Stop 
dawdling. 
</P>
<P>
On the streets today, there are kids with straight parts in their hair and 
lunch in their Batman boxes. Behind these kids there is a private tutor, at 
least one parent whose alarm bell precedes the school bell, whose workday 
begins with the urgent morning job of getting everyone out of the house. 
Someone who wages a small battle against the sleepy summer tug of leisure, or 
its evil twin, sloth. 
</P>
<P>
This is what morning is like in America. Not the image of ripe Reaganesque 
fields and flags, but of pressed parents who may regret the sound of their own 
impatience sprinkling the breakfast cereal. It is the image of kids collected 
in buses and cars, delivered to buildings and redistributed to teachers and 
classrooms. Americans on schedule, on line, productive. 
</P>
<P>
There is no mystery to why we trade our inner pace for a workaday lock step. 
There is no living to be made on the sand. Nor is there any mystery to why we 
become our children's trainers in this pattern. We are driven for the most part 
by what Barbara Ehrenreich calls succinctly in her new book title, "The Fear of 
Falling." 
</P>
<P>
Even the middle class in America, or especially the middle class in America, is 
insecure about its economic future and its children's future. That's more true 
now in an era when the middle is shrinking and many are slipping down or 
scrambling up. The fear of falling attaches itself to another anxiety -- "a 
fear of inner weakness," as Ehrenreich observes, "of growing soft, of failing 
to strive, of losing discipline and will." 
</P>
<P>
We fight these anxieties in ourselves by making a virtue out of necessity: hard 
work. We fight it in our children by driving out daydreams with discipline. Our 
own days speed up and we teach, even compel, our children to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
If we are very lucky, we find work we like and schools where our children are 
happy. But it's only when we step aside for a time, a week or a summer that the 
pace becomes daunting, unnatural. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon, I know, long before we have emptied the last jar of blackberry 
jam, it will seem routine again. To the children on my street, the school year 
that crackles with a fresh start will grow as worn and familiar as a chalkboard 
eraser. Workaday life will seem as normal as wearing a necktie instead of a 
T-shirt, heels instead of sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
But today, having just left the ocean for the city, I am most aware of the 
deliberate, even dutiful, way we prepare our children to lead the exact life 
that we find so rushed. The pressure is on. Hurry, kids.

'CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY II'; 
</P>
<P>
WITH NORMALCY ELUSIVE, SOUTH AFRICA MIGHT TRY RATIONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERMANN GILIOMEE, Hermann Giliomee is a professor of political studies at 
the University of Cape Town, South Africa.

CAPE TOWN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa is the kind of country where one is filled with hope on a Monday, 
only to be catapulted into utter despair on a Tuesday. This observation by Alan 
Paton, author of "Cry the Beloved Country," once again came through after the 
encouraging results of Wednesday's election were followed by unconfirmed 
reports of more than 25 people being shot dead by the police the same day. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, two elections have just occurred in South Africa: the one within 
the parliamentary system, which still excludes the black majority, and the 
second being the expression of the Mass Democratic Movement. This is the 
current umbrella body of all extra-parliamentary organizations, ranging from 
churches to trade unions to civic bodies. 
</P>
<P>
The official election produced no result except to entrench the stalemate 
between the government and its main adversary, the outlawed African National 
Congress, whose internal allies here keep popping up under different names. 
</P>
<P>
The expressed intention of the ANC and the Mass Democratic Movement is to 
dispel any illusion that normalcy has returned to South Africa now that the 
apparently urbane Frederik W. de Klerk has stepped into the shoes of the 
bellicose P. W. Botha. In this they succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
In Cape Town, the police riot squad showed itself unable to handle what were 
essentially peaceful demonstrations in the mode of the American civil-rights 
movement under the leadership of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who is 
greatly revered among the colored, or mixed-raced, community of the city. The 
violence and the deaths have rocketed proper control over the police to the top 
of De Klerk's agenda. Police reform will become the litmus test of his 
reformist will. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk confronts this and other challenges as leader of a party that was 
badly mauled in the election by both the left and the right. The party has lost 
25 seats, and the overall impact of the result is an unprecedented opportunity 
in white politics. 
</P>
<P>
Despite De Klerk's fairly comfortable overall majority, the politics of the 
ruling white group is clearly entering a process of realignment that may 
inexorably shift the National Party away from apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
The government's effort to re-enter the financial markets of the West is 
forcing it to make the kind of adaptations that will inevitably bolster support 
for the right wing in the Afrikaner community, which dominates white politics. 
</P>
<P>
The more pragmatic English-speaking whites, comprising nearly 40% of the 
electorate, have shown themselves unwilling this time to be coerced into 
support for the National Party through security scares and xenophobic appeals: 
Glasnost and perestroika are partly responsible for the defection of 
English-speaking voters from the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys found that white youth show a greater willingness, compared to the 
older generation, to support the Democratic Party, which propagates an 
anti-apartheid policy of non-racial individualism. At Stellenbosch, the 
trend-setting Afrikaner university, support for the Democratic Party has risen 
from 5% to 25% over the past decade. Of English-speaking students throughout 
the country, 80% are to the left of the National Party. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the greatest pressure upon De Klerk is the growing resentment of 
the white electorate at large toward the National Party, which has dominated 
white politics for 40 years and which in recent years has allowed graft and 
pork-barrel politics to get hopelessly out of control. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, the National Party finds itself in a position similar to that of 
Israel's Labor Party before its rude awakening of 1977 (after the shift to the 
Likud Party); another striking analogy is the decline of the Unionist Party in 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
This election has produced a result that places the National Party in a similar 
position as previous dominant parties just before major realignments during 
South Africa's political history. Its percentage of the vote has dropped to 
below 50% and the two opposition parties looks much more rigorous and 
committed. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling party can regenerate itself by absorbing one of the two. Such a 
realignment with the right-wing Conservative Party would finally seal South 
Africa's international fate. The only other choice is the leftist Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
In his first statement on the election, De Klerk was quick to point out that 
more than 70% of the white electorate "voted for reform" (meaning both the 
National Party and the Democratic Party). 
</P>
<P>
Any of his predecessors would rather have their right hand wither than group 
the National Party with a party of the left. But De Klerk is enough of a 
realist to know that in the situation in which South Africa finds itself, he 
has little choice. 
</P>
<P>
It is perhaps too early to cite the prophecy of Israel's Abba Eban that men and 
nations turn to rationality after they have exhausted all alternatives. But 
after this election, there are some stirrings of hope.

INGLEWOOD GROUP WANTS TO LIMIT TERMS IN OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Inglewood residents, citing the potential for "stagnation and abuse 
of power" among incumbent officeholders, has begun preparing a ballot 
initiative for next June that would limit all of Inglewood's elected officials 
to three consecutive terms in office. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the petitions have hit the streets, however, strong opposition is 
developing. Critics call the measure a political move by a small group of 
residents to steer their candidates into office and wrest control of city 
government from the incumbents and the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Organizer Curren D. Price Jr. said the newly formed Inglewood Citizens for 
Reasonable Reform wants a limit on government service to keep elected officials 
accountable to the voters and to lessen the stronghold incumbents have on their 
seats, whether they are effective or not. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not directed at anyone personally," said Price, a community activist. 
"It's a forward-looking measure. In no way should it be looked at as an attack 
or a swipe on anyone currently in office." 
</P>
<P>
But third-term Councilman Anthony Scardenzan, who would be prevented from 
seeking reelection if the measure goes into effect, called the initiative 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"The community is going to be deprived of the opportunity to select the elected 
official they want," Scardenzan said. "A mayor will be out after three terms 
even if he walks on water. The community should decide that. Not Curren Price." 
</P>
<P>
The measure would allow Mayor Edward Vincent, first elected in 1982, only one 
more four-year term in office. Scardenzan and Councilman Daniel Tabor, who were 
both first elected in 1981, could not run for reelection when their third terms 
end in 1993. City Clerk Hermanita Harris, first elected in 1985, and City 
Treasurer Wanda Brown, first elected in 1987, would have two more terms. 
Council member Jose Fernandez, elected to complete an unexpired term in June, 
could continue as a councilman for two or three four-year terms depending on 
whether his unexpired term is counted as a full term. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed City Charter amendment would permit a maximum of three consecutive 
terms in a single position and would permit those who have reached the limit to 
run for another office or sit out four years before running again. 
</P>
<P>
"Twelve years is a reasonable span of time for a person to make a 
contribution," said Price. "At that point, they should step aside, move up or 
move over." 
</P>
<P>
Scardenzan charged that Price, a supporter of Tabor, is proposing the measure 
as a political ploy to ease competition for future city races. Once Vincent is 
out of the way as mayor, Tabor would have a better chance of winning that 
position, Scardenzan said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Scheme 
</P>
<P>
But Price insisted that the initiative is a step toward more responsible 
government and not a scheme to take over any politician's seat. Tabor said he 
has nothing to do with the ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
To get the proposed City Charter amendment on the ballot next June, the group 
must collect signatures from 15% of the city's registered voters, an estimated 
7,500 names. 
</P>
<P>
The measure's proponents submitted a notice of intent to circulate the petition 
last Friday. City Atty. Howard Rosten must now prepare an impartial ballot 
summary and title in the coming weeks. After a newspaper notice of the measure 
is published, the petitions can begin circulating. 
</P>
<P>
Price said the initiative must gain widespread grass-roots support because it 
is not in elected officials' interest to endorse it. He said the measure is 
already supported by many neighborhood and civic leaders, small-business owners 
and former elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very doubtful that an elected official would voluntarily agree to place a 
limitation on their terms," Price said. He added later, "We hope that 
enlightened, positive-minded government officials would support this." 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood's 100-member United Democratic Club is expected to support the 
initiative at its meeting Thursday, the group's vice president, Terry Coleman, 
said. Citing big-city machine politics, such as the long-term administration of 
the late Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, Coleman said: "I don't want to see a 
demagogue or a dictator" in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neither For Nor Against 
</P>
<P>
Tabor said his position is somewhere between the measure's critics and 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"At the present, I don't have a for-or-against stance on it," said Tabor, who 
was narrowly elected to his third four-year term in June. "I don't see it as 
necessary, but I don't see it being an evil thing, either." 
</P>
<P>
Tabor said the limits would "keep different personalities and different 
perspectives" in leadership positions, but, he added, "I don't think continuous 
turnover of elected officials is necessarily good. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that troubles me the most is that it takes a while to learn how the 
process works before you can make long-term changes," Tabor continued. "You'll 
be constantly forced to deal with short-term things. Most development projects 
take five to 10 years to put together." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said he will let the voters decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"If they collect enough signatures and it passes, let the will of the people be 
done," Fernandez said. "I feel it's not something I should get involved in. . . 
. I'm neither for it or against it. It's something the people have to think 
about. It's that kind of issue." 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Harris refused to comment on the measure. Neither the mayor nor the 
city treasurer could be reached. 
</P>

Lee Weinstein, Vincent's predecessor who served as mayor from 1979 to 1983, 
said a limit on terms in office would contribute to the notion of public 
service and prevent officeholders from using politics for "feeding at the 
public trough." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Terms 'Sufficient' 
</P>
<P>
"I've observed over the years that there is a tendency to become so dependent 
on the office you hold that you become corrupt in your efforts to hold that 
office," Weinstein said. "Three terms is certainly sufficient. Anything beyond 
that is an empire. . . . I guess I'm pretty old-fashioned. I always looked at 
public office as public service." 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood's school board already limits its members to three consecutive 
four-year terms, and supporters of the initiative said more than 125 
municipalities across the country limit their elected officials' terms. 
Twenty-six states also limit their governors to two consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
But a state Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled in April that some local 
measures limiting terms in office are invalid because eligibility to hold 
office is controlled by state law. 
</P>
<P>
That ruling concerned general-law cities, those that operate under general laws 
of the state rather than their own municipal charters, but the ruling's 
possible application to charter cities such as Inglewood remains in question. 
</P>
<P>
The court reviewed the case of a councilwoman in South San Francisco who was 
reelected to a third term in 1987 despite a local law forbidding more than two 
consecutive terms. In its decision, the court upheld the election of 
Councilwoman Roberta Cerri Teglia and decided that numerous state code 
provisions governing eligibility to hold office in general-law cities indicate 
that the state governs such matters. 
</P>
<P>
In the general-law city of Rolling Hills Estates, Councilwoman Jacki McGuire 
said she has shelved plans to circulate petitions on a similar initiative in 
that city because of the recent court decision. Instead, McGuire is attempting 
to gain support from state officials for a bill that would allow general-law 
cities to limit their own officeholders' terms. If that fails, McGuire said, 
she would consider launching a statewide initiative that would put the issue on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ran for Other Offices 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach and Cerritos are two charter cities in the Los Angeles area that 
have already passed ordinances limiting time in office to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach law, enacted in a charter election in 1975, prevented former 
Mayor Barbara Doerr and City Councilman Archie Snow from running for their 
offices again this year. The two then ran for other offices; Doerr won election 
to the council in March, and Snow was defeated in a bid for mayor. Snow has 
hired a lawyer to challenge the law. 
</P>
<P>
The Cerritos two-term limit was approved by voters in 1986 as a means of 
preventing long-term incumbents from seeking office again. But confusing 
wording led City Atty. Ken Brown to issue an opinion that the limit applied 
only to terms beginning after the ordinance took effect. It has yet to prevent 
anyone from running again. 
</P>
<P>
On the state level, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp has incorporated a proposed 
limit on the terms of state officeholders into his gubernatorial campaign. Van 
de Kamp proposed the state's first-ever limits on the consecutive years a 
person may hold a single office -- 12 years for the Assembly and Senate and 
eight years for statewide constitutional officers. Van de Kamp's proposed 
limits would not be retroactive but would start as of the 1990 elections.

CATALINA'S FLOATING LIFELINE; 
</P>
<P>
ALMOST EVERYTHING ISLANDERS EAT, BUILD OR SELL COMES FROM THE MAINLAND ON 
BARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a thought that may not cross the mind of the average tourist to Santa 
Catalina Island this weekend, but almost everything he buys or eats was sent 
over from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
And more than likely, that souvenir T-shirt or those fresh salad vegetables 
made the 22-mile crossing to the island by barge. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina's most vital links to the mainland are based at Berth 184 in Los 
Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Islander and Islander II, the two 128-foot-long barges transport food, 
fuel, clothing, cars, construction materials and just about everything else it 
takes to live in Avalon or Two Harbors, the even more isolated community on the 
other side of the island. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15,000 Visitors a Day 
</P>
<P>
Their task is awesome: to supply the necessities of life to Catalina's more 
than 3,000 year-round residents and as many as 15,000 visitors a day during the 
peak summer tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
Making more than 200 round trips annually from their Wilmington berth to their 
island landing near Pebbly Beach Road, about a mile east of Avalon, the 
flat-bottomed boats are Catalina's umbilical tie to "overtown." 
</P>
<P>
The barges, pulled by tugboats across the channel, make round-trip crossings at 
least five times a week in summer and three times a week in winter, depending 
on the tides and the whims of the weather, said Jim Radcliffe, vice president 
of Catalina Freight Lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Major Necessity' 
</P>
<P>
"The barge is definitely the one and only major necessity on the island," said 
Sally Freeman. She and her husband own a wholesale food supply company as well 
as Fred and Sally's, one of Avalon's two supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina's remoteness is one of its greatest attractions, but it also means 
that residents and merchants must rely heavily on sea transport, particularly 
for items like fresh fruit, vegetables and other perishables. Mail and some 
small packages are delivered by air. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the Santa Catalina Island Co. announced a sweeping, 15-year 
development plan that will overhaul much of Avalon. The plan includes the 
construction of new hotels, a new fire station and, eventually, a new City Hall 
and civic complex. Once development begins, the barges' importance to the 
island's existence will increase, since developers rely on them to transport 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the challenges of building over here is our geographic isolation, and 
the need to plan out exactly how the construction process is going to work, 
because it's totally different from the mainland," said Ron Doutt, vice 
president of the Santa Catalina Island Co. "You can figure anything built on 
Catalina is going to cost at least 50% more (than on the mainland)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Priority Items 
</P>
<P>
The logistics include coordinating the arrival of the right kinds of 
construction workers with the right goods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you forget an order of 4-by-4s or you forget some bolt, you can't go down 
and just pick up what you've forgotten," Doutt said. "You've got to wait for 
the next barge, and hope that is a priority item and will get on." 
</P>
<P>
Whether a last-minute order makes it onto the barge depends on the item -- food 
and fuel take priority -- its size, and whether the barge is full, said Leo 
Hernandez, who manages freight company operations in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
The barge is a "roll-on, roll-off" operation, meaning that already loaded truck 
trailers are driven over a ramp directly onto the barge, where the trailers are 
disconnected from the truck and parked for the cross-channel ride to Avalon. 
There, the trailers are either unloaded at the company's warehouse or 
reconnected to a truck and hauled to their island destination. 
</P>
<P>
"In those trailers, we put all of the island's building products, all of the 
food services, all of the clothing -- everything," said Ed Fine, manager of 
barge operations at Pebbly Beach Road in Avalon. "Everything that it takes for 
a community to live." 
</P>
<P>
The barge also carries nearly 3 million gallons of fuel per year, including 
diesel fuel to operate Southern California Edison's power plant on the island, 
Radcliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operated Since 1958 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Freight Lines, which employs about 18 people in Avalon and Wilmington 
during the peak summer season, has operated the barges since 1958, Radcliffe 
said. Before that, the Santa Catalina Island Co. transported goods by steamer. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Freight, whose rates and operation are regulated by the state Public 
Utilities Commission, charges $6.77 per 100 pounds of freight, with higher 
rates for furniture, vehicles and other bulky items. The barges' sheer weight 
-- 326 tons unloaded -- makes crossing possible in all but the most stormy 
seas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say barge service is reliable -- except when nature does not 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
During particularly bad weather, such as a series of storms during January, 
1988, the barges may be out of commission for two or three days, freight 
company officials said. Or, if the tide is not high enough, tug operators are 
unable to bring a barge close enough to shore to extend the loading ramp. 
</P>
<P>
At such times, island residents and merchants either cope with shortages or 
find ways around them. 
</P>
<P>
"We have problems getting goods once in a while when the weather is scuzzy or 
the tides aren't right," Freeman said. "We've had occasions where a barge can't 
come over for three days, and that's very hard. The store panics when they see 
the weather is getting a little scuzzy because the local people start hoarding 
milk and bread." 
</P>
<P>
If their store runs out of such perishable items, Freeman said, her husband 
flies the couple's plane to the mainland to pick up more. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents who can't get what they need at Avalon's stores find their own 
alternative sources. 
</P>
<P>
Like John W. R. Windle, whose wife, Jean, ran out of a preserving solution when 
she was canning fresh peaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I got my kids to send it over for me," Windle said. 
</P>

ASSEMBLY OKS WARNINGS FOR TEACHER SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
School administrators would have to notify teachers whenever a student with a 
violent history is assigned to their classroom, under legislation passed 
overwhelmingly by the Assembly on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also would increase penalties for assaulting a school employee 
off school grounds in retaliation for an act performed in the course of the 
victim's duties at the school. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), was approved on a 68-0 vote 
and returned to the Senate for action on minor amendments made in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins introduced the bill in March at the request of the United Teachers-Los 
Angeles after a 15-year-old Pacoima youth with a history of disciplinary 
problems stabbed his teacher in the back during an Olive Vista Junior High 
School class March 6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teacher Slain 
</P>
<P>
Later that month, Grant High School teacher Hal Arthur was ambushed and shot to 
death in front of his Sherman Oaks home as he left for school. Although police 
have no leads in the case and have not identified any student as a suspect, 
Robbins said Arthur's death was also a factor in his support of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sensible effort to try to protect teachers," Assemblyman Terry B. 
Friedman (D-Los Angeles) said of the bill. "Teachers are fearful because 
students with weapons or students who are a lot bigger and stronger than them 
are threatening and hurting them." 
</P>
<P>
The bill would require school districts to inform the teacher of every student 
who has caused or attempted to cause injury to another person within the 
previous three years. Teachers would be required to maintain the 
confidentiality of the information they received. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also would establish a new crime for the retaliatory assault or 
battery of a school employee off of school property. An assault would be 
punishable by up to one year in county jail and a fine of $2,000. Battery would 
be punishable by up to three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Under law, assaults are not treated differently just because they involve 
school employees.

HEDGECOCK ON LONG LIST OF WITNESSES IN HUNTER FRAUD TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Mayor Roger Hedgecock is one of 529 potential defense witnesses in the 
fraud and tax evasion trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter, according to a list 
submitted Wednesday to federal court by Hunter's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Although the document, which is not yet part of the official court record, 
lists potential witnesses, Hunter's attorneys have stated several times that 
Hedgecock's testimony is essential to prove that Hunter made a legitimate 
investment when she gave money to the company managing Hedgecock's 1983 mayoral 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Court Judge Earl B. Gilliam temporarily released the list to 
reporters Thursday, but the list was recalled after a few moments when defense 
attorney Richard Marmaro saw it in the audience. The list is expected to be 
made public when defense attorneys officially submit the list with all 
supporting paper work, possibly today. 
</P>
<P>
Also included on the witness list are a number of Hunter's relatives, including 
her son, George, who was excluded from the courtroom Thursday, and many figures 
associated with J. David &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The potentially large number of witnesses will be used by Hunter's attorneys to 
defend her against prosecutors' allegations that she participated in the J. 
David Ponzi scheme.

WEEKENDER: MEXICAN FIESTA WILL LET VISITORS 'SEE HISTORY AND PARTICIPATE IN 
IT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The South Bay will revisit its Spanish and Mexican heritage Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In Carson, the occasion will be a free Mexican Independence Day celebration at 
Dolphin Park, 21205 S. Water St., from noon to 6 p.m. "We want to give people a 
sample of the culture of the Mexican heritage," said Glenn Salas, park 
director, who said the fiesta -- now in its 12th year -- has been growing 
steadily and drew 1,500 people last year. 
</P>
<P>
Across the South Bay, a remnant of history, a 150-year old adobe ranch home, 
will be in the spotlight during the annual free Centinela Adobe Fiesta, where 
people are encouraged to wear sombreros, mantillas and shawls to help turn back 
the clock to rancho days. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to see history, to participate in the way it used to be," said 
Christina Machado Essex, fiesta chairman and great-great-granddaughter of 
Ignacio Machado, who built the adobe in the early 1830s, raising corn and 
cultivating 6,000 grapevines on his ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The fiesta will be from 2 to 5 p.m. Sunday at the adobe, 7634 Midfield Ave., on 
the Westchester-Inglewood boundary. 
</P>
<P>
The Carson celebration marks "el 16 de septiembre," the day in 1810 that Father 
Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla urged the peasants of Mexico to revolt against three 
centuries of Spanish Colonial rule. Although it took 11 years to defeat Spain, 
the day of the priest's exhortation is regarded as the birth of independent 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment at the park will be, as Salas puts it, "all Mexican" -- from 
colorfully costumed folkloric dancers drawing their music and dances from 
various Mexican states to popular Latino music played by the Sabor band. 
</P>
<P>
The headliner is Mari Jimenez, a Mexican-born singer of ranchero music, 
Mexico's equivalent of country-Western, who will be joined by a mariachi group. 
</P>
<P>
Sports will be almost as visible as music and dancing at the celebration, with 
a boxing exhibition and youth soccer tournament on tap. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will be able to enjoy carnival games, buy a variety of arts and crafts 
and munch on Mexican foods -- that is, if they don't bring their own family 
picnics. 
</P>
<P>
Salas said teen-agers will have an area all to themselves at the fiesta, 
complete with dancing to a live DJ, and contests -- ice-cream eating, tortilla 
tossing and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
The park director said a Mexican-themed celebration is a natural for Carson, 
which not only has a large Latino population of its own, but draws people from 
Wilmington and the harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just been getting bigger and bigger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Folkloric dancing and music also will be a highlight at the Centinela Adobe 
Festival, where the youthful 10-member Danzes de Tierra will perform dances of 
Northern Mexico and Veracruz state in front of the tree-shaded adobe. 
</P>
<P>
"We really enjoy dancing for this group because these people are really into 
history," said group leader Yolanda Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Gladys Waddingham, a founder of the Historical Society of Centinela Valley, 
which maintains the adobe, said the fiesta was started in 1972 as a way of 
bringing the community closer to its heritage. The adobe is known as the 
birthplace of Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
After its construction by Machado, the place had a variety of owners, the most 
famous being Daniel Freeman, who bought the house and its surrounding 25,000 
acres for $140,000 in gold in 1885. He later turned 11,000 acres into a 
settlement that grew into the city of Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's fiesta will give people a chance to pretend it's the old days, 
according to Essex. They'll be able to make butter on an old hand-operated 
churn and grind coffee on an antique grinder. There will be demonstrations of 
porcelain-doll painting, lace making and spinning. Women will make tortillas by 
hand, and Mexican pan dulce will be on sale. 
</P>
<P>
Such special historical exhibits as Indian artifacts and quilts will be 
presented, and the permanent attractions of the adobe, with its thick walls and 
low ceilings, will be on view. Among them are furniture, musical instruments, 
portraits, dolls, leather hatboxes and the bric-a-brac of decades. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will be able to tour the two other buildings on the adobe grounds. One 
is a research center, decorated in Victorian paneling and decorative glass 
taken from the demolished Daniel Freeman Mansion, and housing a variety of 
displays and historic photos. The second building is the former Freeman land 
office, a circular wooden structure with a wide veranda and artifacts of 
Freeman's land development and other business activities. 
</P>
<P>
Said Essex: "We want people to see history, see the way it was, and to 
participate in it. We may be able to go to the moon, but we still need to be 
involved in our history." Gerald Faris

STUDENTS SUE TESTING FIRM OVER DISQUALIFIED SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than two dozen students from a La Crescenta high school filed suit 
Thursday against the Educational Testing Service, claiming results of their 
advanced placement exams were invalidated without justification. 
</P>
<P>
The suit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles alleges that the national 
testing organization in Princeton, N.J., violated Crescenta Valley High School 
students' right to due process when it invalidated exams given in May because 
seven of the 79 students were caught cheating. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks for unspecified damages and the reinstatement of the test scores 
of students who did not cheat on the exam. The tests are scheduled to be given 
again on Saturday and Sept. 16 and 23. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson denied the students' request for an order 
postponing the retesting until the court rules on whether the original test 
scores should be released, said Craig N. Rossell, attorney for the students. 
The judge set an Oct. 31 trial date on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Most colleges give credit for introductory college courses to students who do 
well on the exams, which students can take in either their junior or senior 
year of high school. 
</P>
<P>
But 13 of the La Crescenta students who took the tests will be enrolled in 
college for months before they get their scores. 
</P>
<P>
The cheating was revealed in May after several students conveyed their 
suspicions to school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Several days later, seven students admitted that they had copied the answers of 
other students or opened test booklets too soon. 
</P>
<P>
Parents of students who filed the lawsuit have sought to have the scores 
reinstated for those who did not cheat for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that these kids are being punished for being honest," said Sheryl 
Wirt, whose daughter, Melissa Dodd, will have to enroll in two biology classes 
at UC Irvine while she awaits the results of the retest. 
</P>
<P>
"They've prepared for these exams for nine months," Wirt said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, not only will they have to go through the whole grueling experience 
again, but they won't do as well."

CARSON TO INVESTIGATE CHARGES BY NAACP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carson officials plan to investigate charges raised by the NAACP this week that 
the city keeps blacks out of top decision-making posts in City Hall through 
discriminatory hiring practices. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sylvia Muise has requested that an agenda item be prepared for an 
upcoming council meeting that will refer the complaints to the city's Human 
Relations Commission and order that group to report back to the council. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has not yet investigated the charges raised by the NAACP," Muise said 
in an interview Thursday. "I am concerned about what is perceived by some as 
racism in City Hall. If there is a perception, we have an obligation to look at 
that." 
</P>
<P>
About 30 black demonstrators, many of them members of the Carson branch of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, held a march and rally 
before Tuesday's council meeting to protest the lack of black directors in City 
Hall and an environment that they say is hostile toward blacks. There are two 
vacancies among the city's seven department heads, and protesters urged the 
city to fill at least one of them with a qualified black. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Michael Mitoma disputed the NAACP's assertions and said he plans to 
resign as a member of the local chapter because of its charges of racism.

Simmering racial tensions between Asian and Latino prisoners at a 
minimum-security California Youth Authority facility in the Antelope Valley 
boiled over into a full-scale battle Thursday night when more than 26 inmates 
fought for nearly 20 minutes before they were subdued by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Steve Shaw said most of the Asian and Latino inmates at Camp Fenner, a 
minimum-security work camp in Llano, were involved in the fight, which was 
waged with mops, brooms and sticks. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said four prisoners were treated at hospitals for injuries received in the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
The disturbance, which broke out shortly before 9 p.m., stemmed from a racially 
motivated fight earlier in the day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Fenner houses 125 juvenile offenders who are between the ages of 18 and 
25.

MILWAUKEE RIPS WITT QUICKLY IN 7-1 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
To a man, the Angels insist they aren't conceding the American League West 
title yet. In fact, third baseman Jack Howell says this is the point in the 
season where "every player has to go home every night and kick himself in the 
butt." 
</P>
<P>
For the first 15 minutes of Thursday night's game, the Milwaukee Brewers did 
that for the Angels, scoring five times in the first inning en route to a 7-1 
victory before 24,012 fans. 
</P>
<P>
After the first inning, the Angels might just as well have mailed in their 
at-bats. They made Brewer starter Tom Filer (6-3) look like Nolan Ryan. Angel 
hitters managed just four hits off Filer, which included an infield single and 
a half-swing blooper. Chili Davis had the only extra-base hit for the Angels, 
tripling off reliever Tony Fossas in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
So the Angels are six games behind division-leading Oakland, the largest 
deficit they've faced this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the matter is that we don't have enough people putting together 
efficient at-bats on a daily basis," Manager Doug Rader said. "A number of key 
players aren't doing much with the bat." 
</P>
<P>
Is there even a chance the Angels are maybe just a little bit disillusioned 
with the results of the past few weeks? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have enough offense, if you're not running the bases and scoring 
runs and congratulating each other, you look flat. That's the only reason we 
look flat." 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers certainly had no problems in that area Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Witt was making his 300th appearance as an Angel -- second only to Dave 
LaRoche (304) in club history -- but the Brewers quickly made it a night he'd 
rather forget. Of course, this hasn't been a very memorable season for Witt any 
way you look at it. 
</P>
<P>
Witt (8-13), whose season-long struggles have been well-chronicled, reached a 
new low this time out, giving up six hits and five runs in the first inning. 
Milwaukee had a 3-0 lead before he retired a batter. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seemed like they hit everything," said Witt, who has been working with 
pitching coach Marcel Lachemann on speeding up his delivery. "I felt I had good 
stuff, but I didn't put the ball where I wanted to. And they hit some good 
pitches, too." 
</P>
<P>
Witt didn't pitch well, to be sure, but he got very little help from his 
friends afield, and that made matters worse in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Felder opened the festivities by beating out a grounder to second base 
that Johnny Ray charged and then bobbled before deciding not to attempt a 
throw. Bill Spiers followed with a a line drive to right field that bounced in 
front of -- and then off the glove of -- Max Venable and rolled to the wall for 
a triple. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Molitor gave the Brewers a 2-0 lead with a double down the left-field 
line, and Robin Yount made it a three-run advantage with a single to right. 
</P>
<P>
Witt got Greg Brock to pop out and earned a Bronx cheer. Rob Deer also popped 
out, but Glenn Braggs and B. J. Surhoff both singled, and the Brewers were up, 
4-0. With Ed Romero up, Surhoff broke for second, and Braggs, who was on third, 
started for home. When recently acquired catcher Ron Tingley's throw sailed 
into right-center, Braggs jogged home and Surhoff took second with a 
double-steal. 
</P>
<P>
It was Braggs' third steal of home this season, tying him for the Brewer record 
with Molitor, who accomplished the feat three times last year. 
</P>
<P>
Braggs used an even easier way to get home in the fifth, belting a Witt 
delivery deep into the left-field seats for his 15th homer. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels finally pushed across an unearned run in the sixth. Filer threw high 
to first after fielding a dribbler by Devon White, and Venable singled White to 
third. One out later, he scored on a half-swing, opposite-field single to left 
by pinch-hitter Jim Eppard. 
</P>
<P>
It was too little, too late, which may also describe any kind of winning streak 
the Angels can muster at this point. 
</P>
<P>
"We went into that last road trip in first place," Witt said. "We come back 
three or four games behind. That's hard to take. We just haven't regrouped." 
</P>
<P>
Rader did admit that the Angels need to win a few games down the stretch, even 
if the A's remain beyond their reach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's vitally important that we win some games in September," he said. "To this 
point, we haven't proved that's something we can do, and I don't want that to 
be a trend." 
</P>
<P>
And then, when someone pointed out that the Angels had shown resiliency at 
other junctures this season, Rader allowed a rare negative thought to escape. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know how emotionally resilient this team is right now," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The realization that the American League West title may be slipping from his 
team's grasp hasn't changed Manager Doug Rader's approach to the game. He tries 
to maintain his perspective and remain philosophical. "We will continue to 
persevere and focus on the immediate," Rader said. "I said it early and it's 
still true. Our goal is to play to our ability. If at the end of the year, 
that's good enough to win it, then that's a blessing. If not, we'll have to do 
some things to get better. We can't concern ourselves with the things we can't 
control. We can only play to our ability. That's all we can hope to 
accomplish.". . . First baseman Wally Joyner was removed from Thursday night's 
game in the sixth inning because of blurred vision caused by new contact lens. 
His replacement, Jim Eppard, came through with a run-scoring single.

MCMAHON: HE'S HERE, BIG AS LIFE 
</P>

<P>
Hide the women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 No, that's not right. Jim McMahon already has a woman. They have had three 
children together. And his love for her is so strong that it once caused him to 
sacrifice his relationship with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
Her name is Nancy. She is his wife. She is a saint. She lives with him. Every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Their kids are the joy of Jim McMahon's life. Golf is his favorite sport. 
Chicago is still his city of preference. And playing quarterback in the 
National Football League is his passion. 
</P>
<P>
When the latter is not in season, McMahon can't get back to the privacy and 
creature comforts of his million-dollar home fast enough. Located in the 
upscale northern Chicago suburb of Northbrook, the McMahon dream house features 
a racquetball court, two locker rooms, a swimming pool, a putting green 
manicured by the agronomist at nearby Sunset Ridge Country Club, a sand bunker, 
a playground, a weight room and, of course, a hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
Ask McMahon, 30, what he misses most about the Midwest since he became a San 
Diego Charger, and he will tell you: "The house . . . sleeping in my own bed." 
The McMahons will return to Northbrook after the season. 
</P>
<P>
So consider the women and children of "America's Finest City" safe. From Jim 
McMahon. For now. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Spanos, the Chargers' chairman of the board-slash-president, might not be 
quite so safe. 
</P>
<P>
Spanos has a heart bigger than the San Joaquin Valley, where he used to drive a 
truck that catered to migrant workers. Spanos parlayed those early dollars into 
a fortune by investing in California's No. 1 natural resource -- real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Now he can afford to be generous. But the core of Spanos is tougher than 
third-and-19. And he is conservative. The quarterback to whom he will pay 
$800,000 in this, the last year of his current contract, is everything but 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
If the questions about McMahon's arm strength and durability turn out to be 
legitimate this year, the Chargers will suffer, and Spanos will carefully find 
a way to channel his displeasure into the public print. He is very good at 
that. McMahon will respond in kind. It will not be a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
If, on the other hand, the instant adrenaline boost McMahon has provided 
doesn't wear off, the Chargers and their improved defense have as good a chance 
as anybody to win the forlorn AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
And if that happens, McMahon will demand a sum of money starting in 1990 that 
will make Dan Fouts' last contract look like chump change. 
</P>
<P>
So, no, despite all the excitement of the moment, the voluble Spanos and the 
disestablishmentarian McMahon will eventually not be safe from each other. It 
is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've changed," McMahon says. 
</P>
<P>
So, yes. Hide the owner. 
</P>
<P>
But understand. It will not be easy. For several years now, the Chargers' 
public relations department has been trying, without success, to sequester the 
public from Spanos' often abrupt reactions to his team's many failures. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents will never be safe from Jim McMahon unless he is recovering from 
another hairline fracture, or sprained shoulder, or lacerated kidney, or 
infected turf burn, strained knee ligaments, stiff neck, sore buttocks, bruised 
ego or sensory overload. 
</P>
<P>
Having broken the huddle, the position of the free safety is usually the first 
mental note McMahon makes as he approaches the line of scrimmage. How the 
defense deploys the free safety sets the tumblers clicking inside McMahon's 
brain. Once they lock into place, the vault to the end zone begins to crack 
open. When the rest of his teammates hear the same signals, a touchdown becomes 
a possibility on every possession, if not every play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a God-given ability that I have," McMahon says. "I've never had a 
big problem picking things up. They got 11. We got 11. There's only so many 
places on the field they can cover. When they're lined up in a certain 
position, they can't cover certain things. To me, it's not that hard. It's a 
chess game is all it is. You just gotta figure your linemen are going to block 
the people they're supposed to block and you have to account for the people 
they don't block. It's not that hard." 
</P>
<P>
And if your linemen don't block the people they're supposed to block? 
</P>
<P>
"Some games you can have fun in the huddle," McMahon says. "Other games you've 
got to get on people's ass. I've never had a problem with that. If somebody 
ain't doing their job, I'll let 'em know. If I'm not doing my job, I want to 
hear about it too." 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 19, 1985, Bear Coach Mike Ditka was trying to do his job on the 
sidelines. It was, as ABC-TV likes to say, "A Special Thursday Night Edition of 
Monday Night Football." It was the third period, and the Bears were losing to 
the Vikings, 17-9. The noise inside the Metrodome was deafening. But the noise 
from McMahon was worse. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka was trying to block it all out. But, dammit, this one was slipping away. 
And as furious as he was with McMahon at that moment, he was even madder about 
the prospect of losing. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon had spent the previous Sunday and Monday nights in traction for a bad 
back. He missed practice Tuesday and Wednesday and aggravated Ditka by sitting 
in the stands at one of the practices and chatting up ABC broadcaster Joe 
Namath. 
</P>
<P>
"Ditka wasn't impressed with that," McMahon says now. "He felt I wasn't paying 
attention or knowing what I was supposed to do. Hell, all the plays are the 
same. Week in and week out, they're all the same. If you got half a brain, you 
can figure that out. But he felt I was not prepared and didn't know what the 
game plan was. That was all B.S." 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday morning, McMahon had developed a leg infection from a turf burn 
that caused an ugly swelling in his calf and convinced him he needn't show up 
for the pregame meeting at the team hotel. This, too, set Ditka off. 
</P>
<P>
So McMahon limped down to the meeting room and propped his throbbing leg up on 
a table. Ditka, McMahon says, was even upset about that. 
</P>
<P>
But by game time, the pain had subsided. McMahon says he told Ditka as much on 
the sideline, and Ditka's response was: "You're not playing tonight. Sit down." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon, diagnosed at an early age as hyperactive, wasn't about to stand for 
sitting down. As the Vikings built their lead, he hectored Ditka relentlessly. 
Finally Ditka gave in. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the only reason he put me in was just to get me out of his face," 
McMahon said later. 
</P>
<P>
The results were immediate. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next seven minutes, the essence of McMahon came out," wrote Phil Hersh 
for the Chicago Tribune. "All the fearlessness, defiance, surpassing talent and 
catalytic leadership ability were on display, as if this were the microcosmic 
look that would make the big picture clear." 
</P>
<P>
On McMahon's first play, he ditched the call from the bench for a screen pass 
and heaved a 70-yard touchdown pass to Willie Gault. The next time he got his 
hands on the ball, he threw another touchdown pass. Six offensive plays later, 
he threw another. The Bears won, 33-24. The next day McMahon, suddenly the 
stuff of legends, checked back into the hospital for more rest. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon and Ditka had been Chicago's answer to the Bickersons from the day 
McMahon showed up at the Bears' Halas Hall headquarters with a beer in his hand 
on draft day 1982. McMahon's first year in the NFL was Ditka's first as a head 
coach. They grew together. They grew apart together. 
</P>
<P>
"My relationship with Jim McMahon is weird and wonderful," Ditka loved telling 
the banquet circuit. "He's weird and I'm wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon was more of a public tweaker than speaker. Asked once to describe a 
Ditka coiffure that wedded hair and forehead in a rather unholy matrimony, 
McMahon said, "I thought winged tips were something you wore on shoes." 
</P>
<P>
When the Bears won Super Bowl XX in January of 1986 there was plenty of 
endorsement money for everybody. Ditka, McMahon and William (The Refrigerator) 
Perry gave new meaning to the phrase, gross national product. Some of the 
offers were, well, outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
According to Steve Zucker, McMahon's agent, a group of secretaries in St. Louis 
once offered $15,000 if McMahon would have lunch with them. McMahon's reaction: 
"People think I'm strange, maybe. I think people are strange, definitely." 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion Perry backed out of an appearance at a dinner party in 
Chicago at the last minute. As hard as it is to imagine Perry turning down a 
free meal, it's even harder to believe that McMahon's dollar value as a fill-in 
went from $10,000 to $15,000 to $20,000 in a matter of minutes. The more he 
said he didn't want to show, the more the high rollers were willing to ante. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, all he had to do for the 20 grand was walk out his front door, get in 
a limo, spend 90 minutes at the party and get back in the limo. He did so and 
still met wife Nancy at a local restaurant by 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
You can read much of this in McMahon's as-told-to autobiography, now three 
years old. It's title is "McMahon." It's subtitle is, "The Bare Truth About 
Chicago's Brashest Bear." 
</P>
<P>
The book was on the New York Times best-seller list for months. But in Chicago, 
it competed with Ditka's as-told-to autobiography titled: "Ditka." 
</P>
<P>
In McMahon's book, he said this about Ditka: "They say there's a lot of Mike 
Ditka in me, and a lot of me in Mike Ditka. That might be true. Some of the 
things he does make me mad, and some of the things I do make him mad. But we 
both want to do the same thing: Win and let the rest take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
In Ditka's book, he said this about McMahon: "There's a lot of things in him 
that are just like I was when I was young and probably like Halas when he was 
young. He'll learn as he goes through life what's important and what isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Bear linebacker Mike Singletary, in his as-told-to autobiography, concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"McMahon is one guy who isn't intimidated by anything or anybody," Singletary 
wrote. "He'll take the challenge no matter what or who stands in his way. In 
that sense, he's a lot like Mike (Ditka)." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's first exposure to George Halas, the now-deceased founder and owner of 
the Bears, was an especially joyless one. It occurred during the summer of 1982 
at the Bears' downtown offices. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka had once characterized Halas' fiscal policy toward players by saying, "He 
throws nickels around like manhole covers." And now McMahon and his former 
agent, Jerry Argovitz, were sitting across the bargaining table from Halas and 
Jim Finks, then the Bears' general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours into the meeting, Finks, a tough negotiator in his own right, 
emerged for air. He was smiling and shaking his head when he stepped from 
Halas' office. The Bears, he acknowledged, were winning this one big -- thanks 
mostly to Halas, who was 87 years old at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Much later, McMahon and Argovitz came out to meet reporters. Argovitz looked 
like a man who had just found out his underwear had been poisoned. McMahon 
looked dazed. 
</P>
<P>
"(Halas) told me if I got $200 a game, I'd be overpaid," McMahon says. "He 
said, 'You've got a bad arm, a bad eye and a bad knee.' So I asked him, 'Why 
the hell did you draft me?' " 
</P>
<P>
Oh, to have been a fly on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The bad eye dated all the way back to McMahon's boyhood. At age six, he was 
playing cowboys and Indians with his brother when he discovered a knot in the 
leather that attached the holster to his leg. He grabbed a fork and strained to 
unloose the knot. 
</P>
<P>
"Wham," McMahon recalls. The fork jumped from the knot and stabbed him in the 
right eye. After a two-week hospital stay, he was released. That the eye still 
doesn't adjust properly to bright lights helps explain why McMahon wears 
sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon never warmed to Halas' grandson, Michael McCaskey, who took over the 
team after Halas' death in 1983. And McMahon never missed an opportunity to 
pillory McCaskey in his book or in public appearences. 
</P>
<P>
An excerpt from the book: "If (McCaskey) had his choice, he'd have 45 players 
with no personality, no individuality at all. Michael McCaskey would like a 
bunch of robots." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskey seethed in private but chose not to respond publicly. The die, 
however, was cast. 
</P>
<P>
"The book started Jim on the road to leaving Chicago," Zucker says. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon had always nurtured fond memories of San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. In 
1980, his junior year at Brigham Young, he completed 32 of 49 passes for four 
touchdowns in BYU's 46-45 Holiday Bowl victory over SMU. He returned to the 
Holiday Bowl the next year and connected on 27 of 43 passes for 342 yards and 
three touchdowns in a 38-36 victory over Washington State. Then, when the Bears 
opened the preseason in San Diego in 1982, he entered late in the game with the 
Chargers on top, 28-7, and closed it to 28-27. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1987 training camp, McMahon sat at a table in the clubhouse of the 
exclusive Butler National Golf Club in Oak Brook, Ill. He had just completed a 
round of golf with Ditka, Michael Jordan and Chicago White Sox broadcaster Ken 
(Hawk) Harrelson. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of Super Bowl XXII being in San Diego crept into the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always played well in that stadium," McMahon said. "I'd love to get back 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the Bears lost to the Redskins in the first round of the playoffs that 
season after dissipating a 14-0 lead. Much is made of McMahon's 35-3 record as 
a starter in his past 38 regular season games since 1984. But it should also be 
noted that he is 0-2 in his last two playoff starts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Ditka had brought in Doug Flutie to replace an injured McMahon. In 
1987, the Bears had drafted Michigan quarterback Jim Harbaugh in the first 
round. This summer, when the Bears determined a younger, more durable Mike 
Tomczak was beating out McMahon, the handwriting was on the wall. It looked 
like graffiti to McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago wasn't a whole hell of a lot of fun the last two years," McMahon says. 
Long before the Bears traded him, he told Zucker he wanted out in the worst 
way. 
</P>
<P>
So last winter, Zucker hustled down to the NFL owners' meetings in Palm Springs 
to seek out Spanos. He finally tracked him down one evening at a fancy 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
His message to Spanos: My client would like to play for your football team. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the spring draft arrived, McMahon and Zucker thought they had laid 
the necessary groundwork. But the Chargers and the Bears couldn't reach an 
agreement on a price tag. Unfortunately for McMahon and Zucker, players and 
agents don't make trades. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of bummed," McMahon said. "I felt the trade coming last year. But 
when it didn't happen, I felt the Bears were going to keep me around just to 
keep me out of somebody else's training camp so I wouldn't be ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons McMahon and the Chargers now think McMahon will be ready to 
play in the season opener Sunday against the Raiders is Ted Tollner, the 
Chargers' new quarterbacks coach. 
</P>
<P>
The former USC coach tutored McMahon during his senior year at Brigham Young, 
and the two have stayed in touch since then. McMahon remembered that Tollner 
wasn't hung up on quarterbacks watching game film -- a pastime McMahon 
despises. 
</P>
<P>
Ask McMahon to talk about all the coaches he has played for, and he will have 
more bad things to say than good. But he thinks the world of Tollner. 
</P>
<P>
As do McMahon's new teammates of him. 
</P>
<P>
"The rumors and how I perceived him from television was, like, totally cocky," 
says rookie Dana Brinson. "But from being around him, he's not like that. He's 
fitting in very well. If he's going to remain that way, I don't know. But at 
the moment, all the guys like him. And with him being here, it makes the 
competition level for all the quarterbacks rise." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been trying to explain this for four or five years," says Tyrone Keys. 
"Everybody thinks Jim has an attitude and guys don't like him. But he's one of 
the best team players a guy could ever ever want to meet." 
</P>
<P>
Keys played on the 1985 Bears and was a 1989 Charger until Monday, when a knee 
injury forced the Chargers to waive him. 
</P>
<P>
"The public perception makes it seem like Jim McMahon's really arrogant and 
doesn't get along with the guys," Keys says. "But that's not true. And 
evidently he's been working out. He looks stronger than I remember. He's 
throwing the ball with a lot of zip." 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon's talent is a treasure. So is his friendship, by most accounts, if he 
has selected you as someone for whom he cares. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers aren't as concerned about that as much as they are about whether 
he can still play. Steve Ortmayer, the team's director of football operations, 
likes to point to McMahon's low career interception percentage (3.7) and say 
things like: "Jim won't drive the car off the road." 
</P>
<P>
But the suspicion persists that if McMahon were a car, the mechanics would 
report back to Ortmayer that the shocks were worn and the treads a little bare. 
McMahon underwent right shoulder surgery after his 1986 and 1987 seasons and 
minor knee surgery at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
"They talked about how in Chicago I couldn't throw the deep ball," McMahon 
says. "That was bull. I threw the deep ball a lot last year. My arm is pretty 
much back to normal. I don't throw it probably as hard as I used to. But I can 
throw the deep and intermediate routes." 
</P>
<P>
The statistics say otherwise. McMahon's average-gain-per-completion last season 
was 11.8 yards, the lowest of his seven-year career. McMahon's best year in 
that category was 1984 (13.48), before he began having shoulder problems. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, says Bruce Allen, a former USFL general manager: "Have you seen 
the way the Chargers have used McMahon so far? They've got him taking three- 
and five-step drops, getting the ball off before the rush can get to him. The 
Chargers are my pick to win their division." 
</P>
<P>
If McMahon can't still play, the Chargers will be hip deep in hot porridge. But 
no matter how well or poorly their gamble on McMahon pays, they will never be 
able to relegate him to the background. The last line of the last paragraph of 
the last page of McMahon's 1986 autobiography says: "To be continued . . . " 
</P>
<P>
You can hurt him, knock him, love him, hate him, write him off and trade him. 
</P>
<P>
But you can't hide Jim McMahon.

Keith Clearwater made five birdies in a seven-hole span on the way to a 
six-under-par 65 and a one-stroke lead in the first round of the $500,000 B.C. 
Open tournament at the En-Joie Golf Club in Endicott, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Clearwater maintained sole possession of the lead when Bob Estes bogeyed his 
final hole to finish with a 66. 
</P>
<P>
Fulton Allem, Gil Morgan and Dave Eichelberger were two strokes behind. There 
were seven players at 68 and 24 at 69. 
</P>
<P>
Clearwater, who hasn't won on the PGA Tour since 1987, when he became the first 
rookie in a decade to take two tournaments in his first year, started slowly 
with just one birdie after six holes. 
</P>
<P>
But he strung three birdies together to finish the front side. Two holes later, 
he took over the lead after coming up 18 inches shy on a 35-foot eagle putt. He 
added another birdie on No. 13 and parred in.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
ORIOLES POUND OUT AN 8-3 VICTORY OVER RYAN AND THE RANGERS IN OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles continued their mastery of Nolan Ryan Thursday night, 
improving to 9-0 in Ryan's last 12 starts against them, with an 8-3 victory 
over the Texas Rangers in the first game of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Devereaux hit a three-run homer and knocked in five runs for the Orioles, 
who saw 16 players go down on strikeouts, including Phil Bradley five times. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers used a club-record 23 players, including six pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan (15-10) allowed seven runs and nine hits, both season-highs, walked four 
and struck out 10 in 6 1/3 innings. With only four remaining starts likely, 
Ryan's hopes for a 20-win season are virtually over. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles raised their record against the Rangers this season to 7-1 and have 
beaten Ryan all three times they've faced him. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan only trailed, 4-3, in the seventh, but he'd thrown 130 pitches over six 
innings and was arm-weary. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan struck out the side in the fourth, the 300th time he has done so in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 12, Cleveland 4 -- George Bell hit a three-run double and Lloyd Moseby 
had three hits, including a leadoff home run as the Blue Jays beat the Indians 
in a rain-delayed game at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Mookie Wilson also had three of the Blue Jays' 17 hits. 
</P>
<P>
John Cerutti (11-8) gave up two runs on five hits in five innings. Both runs 
and four of the hits came in the fifth, immediately after a thunderstorm 
interrupted the game for 1 hour 33 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Acker pitched the sixth, allowing Paul Zuvella's solo homer, and he was 
followed by three relievers. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Candiotti (12-8) lasted only 1 1/3 innings, giving up five runs on six 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
New York 6, Seattle 4 -- Don Mattingly's two-run single keyed a six-run rally 
in the eighth inning as the Yankees rallied to beat the Mariners at Seattle for 
their eighth straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
With New York trailing, 3-0, in the eighth, Steve Balboni drew a leadoff walk 
and Seattle starter Scott Bankhead was relieved by Mike Schooler. 
</P>
<P>
Schooler (1-6) walked two batters and allowed a run to score on a wild pitch. 
After a groundout, pinch-hitter Don Slaught singled home a run to make it 3-2 
before Steve Sax's bloop single to right tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
Alvaro Espinoza singled to load the bases and sent Schooler from the game in 
favor of Keith Comstock. Mattingly, hitting in his 12th straight game, greeted 
Comstock with a single to give the Yankees a 5-3 lead, and Balboni followed 
with a sacrifice fly for the final Yankee run. 
</P>
<P>
Goose Gossage (1-0) pitched one-third of an inning in the seventh to earn his 
first American League victory since Oct. 1, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Lance McCullers gave up a run-scoring groundout to Dave Valle in the eighth for 
Seattle's final run before Dave Righetti came on in the ninth for his 23rd 
save.

INSOLO SET FOR RARE HOMECOMING VENTURE

<P>
Where have you gone, Jimmy Insolo? Or, more appropriately, where have you been? 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe that's not important. What is important to the many Saugus Speedway 
fans who consider Insolo one of the track's all-time greats is that on Saturday 
night, Insolo will be back where he belongs -- racing at Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the few guys who ever came out of Saugus with finesse," said Rick 
Crow, 26, a Saugus Street Stock driver who grew up idolizing Insolo. "He never 
beat the crud out of his equipment and he was a real nice guy in the pits with 
the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Insolo, 46, semi-retired from racing and a resident of Canyon Country, says 
that he considers Saugus his racing home. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always fun to go back to," he said. "It's one of those places that make 
you feel like a star, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Insolo claimed the spotlight at Saugus in the 1960s, winning a track 
championship in 1968. Two years later, he left the one-third-mile oval and 
embarked on one of the most successful careers in NASCAR Winston West Series 
history. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Insolo will compete in the Miller 100, the second appearance 
at Saugus this season of the NASCAR All-American Challenge Series Southwest 
Tour. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same old story," Insolo said. "I just love to race." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, with the exception of occasional appearances, Insolo quit racing 
in 1982 -- just four years after he captured the Winston West title and three 
years after finishing third in the series. 
</P>
<P>
After competing at Saugus from 1963 to 1970, Insolo hit the road for 10 years 
with the Winston West Series as both a regular and part-time competitor. In 
1978, he enjoyed a fabulous season, winning nine of 22 events to claim the 
series title and earning $32,515. 
</P>
<P>
All totaled, Insolo is fourth in Winston West history with 25 career victories. 
His career earnings total $143,225. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Insolo returned to Saugus and finished fourth in the Modified 
division. After the season, however, Insolo, still at the height of his 
success, called it quits. 
</P>
<P>
Pardon the inquiry, but where have you been, Jimmy? 
</P>
<P>
"We decided that it was taking money out of our pockets to keep racing, so we 
weren't going to do it no more," Insolo said. "We would go to the races and win 
and then we would come home and sit down and figure it out and we were losing 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a thing out here on the West Coast and I know everyone has told the same 
old story: You can't race for a living." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why Insolo virtually does not race. And he likely will not return 
unless he lands "a sweet deal." Competing regularly with the Winston West 
Series or Southwest Tour -- both of which include races throughout California, 
Oregon and Nevada -- requires financial backing. Ideally, it requires being 
employed by a racing team. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Insolo was employed as a driver by Trick Enterprises, but the team 
disbanded after a less-than-lucrative season. That left Insolo, who drives a 
truck for a construction company, a privateer once again. And he has not 
exactly been flooded with offers. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to be more of a racer," he said. "I'd like to be full time." 
</P>
<P>
That might be changing. Saturday night will mark the second time this season 
Insolo will be summoned for his driving services. Last month, he competed in a 
Saugus Sportsman program, driving the car of track regular Michael Ayers, a 
longtime family friend. 
</P>
<P>
Insolo finished second in a heat race and climbed to fourth in the main event 
before being forced from the race because of an overheated engine. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southwest Tour race, Insolo will drive the car of Rod Johnson of Canyon 
Country. According to Insolo, Johnson's father, Don, sought Insolo because of 
his experience. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been a lot of things done to the car that I wanted done," Insolo 
said. "And I like that." 
</P>
<P>
And the fans undoubtedly will like Insolo. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'll be able to watch somebody start in the back of the pack, pass 
everyone on the outside and win," Crow said. "If I was a rich guy and I owned a 
bunch of cars, I'd want to hire him to drive." 
</P>
<P>
Crash and yearn: No, as a matter of fact, Dave Phipps does not own the whole 
damned road. 
</P>
<P>
Phipps is, after all, fallible. Phipps has foibles. Phipps, phenomenal in the 
Saugus Speedway Sportsman division the past two seasons, might be finished. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Phipps' 1989 IROC Camaro smacked into the straightaway wall just 
two laps into the 40-lap main event, mangling the car's front fenders and 
knocking the two-time defending track champion from the race. 
</P>
<P>
Phipps, 41, who entered the evening atop the division points standings, fell to 
third place with the non-finish, 18 points behind new leader Keith Spangler of 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
In each of the past two seasons, Phipps has dominated the division, speeding 
away with track titles by no less than 100 points. But this season, with only 
two main events remaining, Phipps' bid to become the track's first driver to 
win three consecutive Sportsman titles might be dead. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that pretty much shot down my chances," Phipps said. "Darn it! There 
is still a chance, but the other guys would have to have misfortune, too, and 
that's not likely. They're pretty strong." 
</P>
<P>
Misfortune is indeed the buzz word that has given Phipps the buzz saw. Despite 
a division-high six main-event wins, he has four non-finishes -- three because 
of mechanical failure -- for which he has earned zero points. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on a roll," he said. "Now, I'm just disappointed. I wanted to keep 
racing with the guys for the championship. But what can I say? I haven't quit 
trying yet. I can't give up." 
</P>
<P>
All aboard: Saugus' program on Saturday night will include the final train race 
of the season as well as Mini Stock Racing Assn. and Saugus Speedway Mini 
Stocks.

BURBANK CASHES IN ON A TIP, 12-7

Alhambra 19, Glendale 10 -- Glendale entered its home opener fearing its 
biggest weakness would be its running game. Stopping the run turned out to be 
its biggest problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Dynamiters allowed 262 yards and three touchdowns on the ground. The 
longest touchdown run came on the combined efforts of Jess Castillo and Frank 
Shiozaki. Castillo broke loose on a 31-yard sweep, but lost control of the ball 
when he was tackled. Shiozaki picked up the fumble and went the final 12 yards 
to give Alhambra its second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale lost a chance to take the lead in the second quarter when a 60-yard 
touchdown pass from quarterback Erik Kiesau to Sang Lee was nullified by a 
penalty. Lee was ruled to have stepped out of bounds before catching the pass. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a young team and that was a very crucial play and it broke our spirit," 
Glendale Coach Don Shoemaker said. "The referee saw that he was out of bounds 
and made the right call." 
</P>
<P>
In his first start, Kiesau completed 18 of 34 passes for 194 yards for 
Glendale. SEAN WATERS

In a game that will not be remembered for its style, it was fitting that the 
winning touchdown was scored on a deflected pass. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Burbank High, senior Patrick Blazon was able to pull in the 
pass in question -- a 17-yarder from Jeremy Sparks -- with 5:11 left to provide 
the Bulldogs with a 12-7 win over Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's game at Burroughs was the season opener for both schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure wasn't pretty," Burbank Coach Randy Stage said. "But you know what? I 
kinda like having more points on the board at the end of the game." 
</P>
<P>
That nearly wasn't the case. Burbank fumbled three times in the second half, 
one of which led to Hoover's only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After Alvaro Cubillas recovered a Burbank fumble at the Bulldog 11-yard line, 
tailback Curtis Kang threw a four-yard option pass to Andre Clarizio for a 
touchdown with four seconds left in the third quarter. David Bronner's 
point-after conversion gave Hoover a 7-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank had scored the first touchdown on a two-yard Nelson Randin run in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
There were bright spots for Burbank, including Sparks. The senior completed 11 
of 17 passes for 141 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Bryan Miclette had six receptions for 85 yards. BRIAN MURPHY

ANGLERS CATCH AND RELEASE THREATENED BLACK SEA BASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The catching and releasing of bass came as a surprise for 12 anglers on a 
half-day trip aboard the Southern Cal, out of Long Beach Sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Pat Whittaker was just past the Long Beach gap on the way to Horseshoe 
Kelp when he noticed birds working near floating kelp. 
</P>
<P>
He made a quick stop, and the anglers started casting anchovies. Within 25 
minutes a near-limit of calico bass went into the sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Then the bite shut off. Instead of moving on, Whittaker urged anglers to go to 
the bottom and try for white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the unusual took place: Every angler who went to the bottom had a 
hookup and reeled in small black sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Black sea bass is on the endangered species list and must be released unharmed. 
Deckhand Myron Ackerman carefully unhooked the bass and returned them to the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid hooking more, Whittaker moved out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Austin of Torrance, fishing from his boat the Jernmo with 12-pound test 
line, did battle for 22 minutes with a marlin at Catalina Island, brought it 
aboard and released it. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Eckland of Redondo Beach, aboard the Happy Hooker, caught and released 
five marlin after weighing one at Avalon. That battler weighed 166 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty boats are expected to compete in the eighth annual King Harbor Marlin 
Club and Marina del Rey Anglers interclub marlin tournament Friday and 
Saturday. The clubs are contesting the perpetual trophy as well as individual 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth annual Dave Freeman fire department burn foundation derby will be 
held Wednesday . Freeman, of the Los Angeles Fire Department's San Pedro 
division, said private boats will depart at 6:30 a.m. and fish until weigh-in 
at the Cabrillo launch ramp at 2:30 p.m. First, second and third prizes will be 
awarded. The entry fee is $20, with proceeds benefiting the burn foundation. 
For information, call (213) 530-9850.

GILL BYRD WISHES TEAMMATES WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY GOD, NOT FOOTBALL, COMES FIRST

<P>
There are times, Gill Byrd admits, when the hurt is so painful, so disturbing, 
that he barely can resist crying. 
</P>
<P>
He cringes at the thought, refusing momentarily to allow the words to emerge, 
but slowly, laboriously, they tumble forth: 
</P>
<P>
"There are times, I don't know, when I kind of feel like an outcast on this 
team. Guys seem to get uncomfortable when I'm around. Sometimes, I really 
wonder if they wish I wasn't (playing) somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd stops abruptly, as if he has said too much. He knows there are certain 
teammates who mock him when he's not around. Others don't even try to hide it, 
taunting him in his presence. 
</P>
<P>
Few pretend to understand him; many have withdrawn from him. 
</P>
<P>
This is a man, by all rights, who should be among the most popular players in a 
Charger uniform. He's the leader of the defensive secondary, intercepting more 
passes last year (seven) than any Charger in the past 25 years. And who can 
remember the last time Byrd had an unkind word about the opposition, let alone 
a teammate? 
</P>
<P>
Byrd said the problem, if you choose to call it that, is simple. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Christian," he said. "I've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal 
savior." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, OK, Byrd is prepared. He knows the moment those words are uttered, 
strange things start happening: 
</P>
<P>
Teammates turn their back and walk away. Reporters shut their notebooks and 
head to the next player. Coaches flinch. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, being a Christian is fine, Byrd has been told, but keep it to yourself. 
This is a place where football is the name; intimidation is the game. There's 
no reason to be spreading that kind of stuff around. If the opposition gets 
wind of this, why, they'll be roaming through the Charger secondary as if it's 
a flag-football game. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," Byrd interrupted, "I may not intentionally take a cheap shot at 
somebody, but when they come into my zone, I'm going to hit them with all of 
the force of love and strength in Lord Jesus Christ behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bible said to be meek, not weak." 
</P>
<P>
Oh. 
</P>
<P>
Look it up if you want. Byrd dares you. This is a man who can recite Bible 
verses quicker than he can passages from his play book. He reads the Bible, not 
Pro Football Weekly, before going to bed. His right-hand man, he says, is Jesus 
Christ, not the free safety. 
</P>
<P>
"He's my No. 1 man," Byrd said. "I love him more than anything or anyone in the 
world. My wife and family understand this. They know they're a close second." 
</P>
<P>
In the macho world of the NFL, where Joe Namath was glorified for his 
womanizing, Jim McMahon idolized for his partying and Max McGee lauded for 
playing in Super Bowls with vicious hangovers, you can just imagine how the 
boys in the lockeroom are taking this. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a pretty good time with the Jim Bakker thing," Byrd said, grimacing. 
"They told me, 'Why should I believe in that stuff? He's supposed to a 
Christian, and look what he's doing. What kind of example is that? 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that he's just a man. When you look at man, they fall short. Look 
toward Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure if anyone bothered to listen. A lot of guys in this league are 
just too busy playing follow the leader. They don't have any backbone. They 
don't have any moral values. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to tell them life's too short to be acting this way. But they're having 
too good of a time to listen." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Byrd, Gill's wife, said: "I think that's what makes it so hard for 
Gill. He just wants so much for them to share what he has that when they reject 
him and in some cases tease him, that hurts more than anything. 
</P>
<P>
"He just feels so alone." 
</P>
<P>
Why, it would be so easy, so easy, Byrd tells himself, to fall back and be one 
of the boys in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Just sprinkle in a couple of profanities every couple of sentences, head out 
with the boys to the neighborhood pub after practice, chase a woman or two and, 
presto, instant popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"No one ever said this was going to be easy," Byrd said, "but this is the way 
I've chosen to live my life. I walk into the locker room, hearing guys cursing, 
talking crazy, maybe passing pictures around of naked women. They'll see me 
come in, and say, 'Oh, excuse me Gill. I'm sorry.' 
</P>
<P>
"I say, 'Hey, don't apologize to me. I'm not the one you should be apologizing 
to. I'm not the one you're going to have to pass judgment to.' 
</P>
<P>
"But you know how it is where there are a lot of guys around. There's boldness 
in numbers. It bothers me. It bothers me a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"But what are you going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's skin darkens with embarrassment as he recall his days at Lowell High 
School in San Francisco. His father was a San Francisco cop, and to this day, 
Byrd has kept the secret away from him. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd doesn't know quite how to put this, but, uh, he was kind of a hoodlum in 
high school. Oh, he didn't mess around with guns and wasn't terrorizing the 
school or anything like that. But he was a pretty good little cat burglar, if 
he does say so himself. 
</P>
<P>
Each day after school, Byrd and his buddies would patrol the hallways and break 
into lockers, stealing everything they could find. They would stash the goods 
in their own lockers until the following morning and sell them to a middleman 
who would go to the neighborhood pawnbroker. They'd be in the clear before the 
property was reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
It was so easy. 
</P>
<P>
It also was so stupid, Byrd says. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even imagine what would have happened if I got caught," Byrd said, his 
eyes opening wide. "Can you imagine if I got caught? The son of a San Francisco 
police officer getting arrested? 
</P>
<P>
"Oooh, I don't think I'd be alive today to even tell this story." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Byrd lived a pretty clean life. He refused the temptation of drugs, 
which was easy, he said, after seeing a cousin ruin his life. The only time he 
drank was the night of his high school graduation. ("I drank champagne until I 
got sick, that was the last time I tried anything.") And he was an excellent 
student. 
</P>
<P>
A great football player? 
</P>
<P>
Nah, this was a kid who couldn't even get a college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
He was a walk-on at San Jose State. His biggest role his freshman year was 
holding the blocking dummies. 
</P>
<P>
He progressed quickly, becoming an honorable mention All-America cornerback his 
sophomore year, but a torn ligament in his right knee seemingly ended his 
football days. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told I'd never play another down," Byrd said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, here it is eight years later, and Byrd is entering his seventh season as 
a Charger starter. He has overcome allergies to grass, a rapid heartbeat that 
must be closely monitored, his size (5-feet-11, 191 pounds), his speed (4.6 in 
the 40), and yes, persecution because of his strong religious convictions. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been easy for Gill," Marilyn Byrd said, "especially since Sherman 
Smith (a former Charger who persuaded Byrd to become a Christian in 1983) left. 
That was kind of his mentor. Now he's by himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's different, though, when he gets on the field. I remember once, I think it 
was in 1986, when Gill was in the middle of this fight. All the other (players' 
wives) in the stands are looking at me? Gill? Is that Gill in a fight? 
</P>
<P>
"What happened was that someone spit at Gill, and he pushed him. When I talked 
to him afterwards, he was just so glad that everyone came to his side, he 
already had forgotten about what he was mad about in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows that some of his teammates are really offended by his beliefs. You'd 
think they couldn't stand him the way some of them talk. But he knows when he 
goes on that field, at least, they think the world of him." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd, playing for his third Charger head coach, with the seventh different 
quarterback directing the offense, vows that he'll maintain the same 
perspective he has in each of his six previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He will be the Chargers' starting right cornerback Sunday in their season 
opener against the Raiders. He has bounced around in more positions in the 
organization than one of George Steinbrenner's ex-managers, starting at five 
positions in the defensive backfield. Since he is shorter than a lot of kickers 
and slower than most linebackers, who thought he'd be around this long? 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows how much longer I can keep playing?" Byrd, 28, said, "but I 
definitely want to be here when we turn this thing around. I'm looking for a 
lot of good things to happen this year." 
</P>
<P>
When Byrd hits his knees Sunday before the game at the Coliseum, he'll pray for 
a successful and distinguished season, just as he does at the beginning of 
every year. He'll pray, he said, for the welfare of the organization "from Alex 
Spanos on down," pray that no one on either team suffers a serious injury . . . 
and yes, he'll pray for a Charger victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I always pray for those," he said. "I've had guys come up to me and say, 'Hey, 
should you be praying for that type of stuff?. I say, 'Why not? You shouldn't 
be afraid to ask for anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hmmm, does it ever puzzle Byrd then that with all his prayers, the Chargers 
have had just one winning season since 1983, and that was during the 
strike-shortened 1987 season? 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble is," Byrd said, smiling, "the guys on the other side of the field 
are praying, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Not much you can do about that." 
</P>

Maybe it's just that the Padres have the whole community thinking crazy things, 
but the Chargers are about to open the season with more optimism than they have 
had since they did their nose dive from the playoffs in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
While Padres fans are talking about a Miracle of Mission Valley, Chargers fans 
are saying stupid things, such as this team is in position to go 12 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
Ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
If these Chargers can go 12-4, they might as well go 16-0. 
</P>
<P>
You scoff? 
</P>
<P>
The Diary of a Perfect Season . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 10, at Raiders 
</P>
<P>
Al Davis stubbornly refuses to divulge where the Raiders will be playing their 
home games this year. Rumors abound that the Raiders are in Inglewood, 
Irwindale, Walnut Creek, Big Pine, Borrego Springs or Eureka. The Chargers have 
no idea where to go, though Davis would have told them had Eugene Klein still 
been the owner. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rozelle forfeits the game to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 17, Houston 
</P>
<P>
Oiler Coach Jerry Glanville has this propensity for leaving tickets for people 
who can't pick them up, such as Elvis Presley. This gives him some publicity 
and saves him some money. However, this week, he leaves tickets for Junipero 
Serra, and 2,000 students show up from a Tierrasanta high school. 
</P>
<P>
Down more than $40,000 by the opening kickoff, the distracted Glanville watches 
as his Oilers are pummeled. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 24, Kansas City 
</P>
<P>
In honor of the return of former Charger Coach Al Saunders, anyone wearing a 
tie to the game gets it cut off at the knot. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kansas City's venerable quarterbacks, Steve DeBerg and Ron Jaworski, 
break curfew at Lawrence Welk Village the night before the game, and the 
Chargers beat up on the punter who takes their place. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 1, at Phoenix 
</P>
<P>
Dan Henning shrewdly takes the Chargers to Death Valley for a week of practice 
to get ready for playing a day game in the Valley of the Sun. What's more, he 
brings back quarterback Mark Malone for one game, theorizing he was used to the 
heat, having played at Arizona State and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, another victory. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 8, at Denver 
</P>
<P>
The offense has a field day against the Orange Mush defense. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 16, Seattle 
</P>
<P>
Note the date change. The Padres needed the stadium Sunday afternoon to 
complete a four-game sweep over Oakland in the World Series, winning 16-2 on 
grand slams by Jack Clark, Roberto Alomar, Bip Roberts and Tim Flannery. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three Seahawks, kept awake by celebrating Padre fans, oversleep and miss 
the opening kickoff. This one is over in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 22, New York Giants 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Taylor rings Jim McMahon's bell with one second to play, but Billy Joe 
Tolliver comes off the injured list and bench to make his regular season debut 
and throws a game-winning touchdown pass to Quinn Early as time runs out. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 29, at Seattle 
</P>
<P>
Seahawk fans are penalized six timeouts and 520 yards for unsportsmanlike vocal 
cords, allowing the Chargers to post a lopsided victory even though they are 
able to run only six offensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 5, Philadelphia 
</P>
<P>
Neither Buddy Ryan's ego nor his defense is a match for Jim McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 12, Raiders 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders forfeit again, this time refusing to come to San Diego because the 
Chargers had not shown up to play them on Sept. 10 in Grizzly Flats. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 19, at Pittsburgh 
</P>
<P>
Lee Williams, Leslie O'Neal and Burt Grossman can't contain their laughter at 
chasing a quarterback named Bubby . . . and the Steelers can't contain them 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 26, at Indianapolis 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Grossman has a tough day. He is the only defensive starter who does not 
recover a fumble by Eric Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 3, New York Jets 
</P>
<P>
Dana Brinson and Marion Butts overshadow a victory over the Jets with the 
announcement that they have sold the movie rights to their biographies. After 
all, they are the first rookies on the same team to rush for more than 1,000 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 10, at Washington 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers score 35 points in the second quarter en route to a 42-10 victory. 
Deja Voo Doo, 'Skins. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 17, at Kansas City 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers celebrate the announcement that 25 players have been named to the 
AFC's Pro Bowl team with their 15th victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 24, Denver 
</P>
<P>
Gary Anderson ends his holdout just in time to do his Christmas shopping. Well 
rested, he leaps 29-feet, 2 3/4-inches to the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I suppose, you are wondering what happens in the playoffs. Surely, you are 
wondering if the Chargers follow the Padres' example and win it all. 
</P>
<P>
Come now, how prescient do you expect me to be here in the early days of 
September? 
</P>
<P>
Let's just play 'em 16 at a time and then go from there.

'ROMERO' LEAVES TRAGEDY UNTOUCHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Romero" (at the AMC Century 14) has the good fortune to have Raul Julia in the 
title role as the martyred Salvadoran archbishop, but his solid portrayal, a 
work of simplicity and concentration, cannot redeem a film that in too many 
crucial ways goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Romero" is an especially poignant example of noble intention done in by 
misguided means, for Julia invests the archbishop with a spirituality that few 
heroes of conventional films with religious themes possess. 
</P>
<P>
Much to his surprise, mild-mannered Monsignor Oscar Romero in 1977 is named 
Archbishop of San Salvador. Some of his colleagues, who identify with the 
country's ultra-conservative ruling class, predict that he will not make waves 
despite the rapidly escalating oppression and brutality of the new Humberto 
regime. The mindless savagery unleashed by the military on the helpless and the 
innocent is too much for Romero to ignore. Drawing upon his faith as a devout 
man of God, he gradually emerges as an implacable leader of the opposition, 
having decided that God's law must transcend that of man. 
</P>
<P>
Writer John Sacret Young and Australian director John Duigan, in his American 
film debut, sketch the outlines of Romero's fate and its implications for the 
relationship between church and state clearly enough, but with breadth rather 
than depth. Although the film does unfold with the requisite sense of tragic 
inevitability, thanks to Julia, nothing else about it rings true, even though 
what is depicted is depressingly credible, drawn as it is from recent, terrible 
(and ongoing) events. 
</P>
<P>
The sad truth is that the film is trite in its dialogue as well as in its 
direction and is seriously marred by the disastrous miscasting of a key role. 
Underlying all these flaws is the pervading sense that the film, cursed with 
the synthetic quality that typically characterizes productions with 
international casts and crews, really has no business being in English in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
This feeling is reinforced by the fact that the film doesn't deal with the role 
of the American government in El Salvador's plight, beyond a plea from Romero 
for us to stop sending arms that will be only used against his country's 
people. The role of the Vatican in El Salvador is soft-pedaled even more. 
Cultural imperialism, in the form of materialistic U.S. values and life styles, 
is noted only in passing, and there's no addressing at all of why Latin 
American political struggles always seem to involve such extreme acts of 
cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
One has to wonder why its producer, Paulist priest Father Ellwood E. Kieser, 
didn't let us experience a Salvadoran film maker's vision of the country's 
seemingly unending tragedy. Surely the audience that is concerned enough with 
Central America to be attracted to Romero's story is sufficiently sophisticated 
to sit still for subtitles. Surely, too, the film would be more appealing to 
Latino audiences were it in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Again excepting Julia, the actors are pedestrian or worse. As a fiery activist 
priest called Father Rutilio Grande, Richard Jordan looks about as Latino as 
Robert Redford; it's no help that his Spanish accent is so erratic. The dozens 
of native extras -- the film was shot in Mexico -- are terribly self-conscious 
and often seemingly perplexed. Clearly, Duigan, one of the least-known and most 
gifted of Australian directors, is way out of his element. Such wonderful films 
as "Mouth to Mouth," "The Winter of Our Dreams" and "The Year My Voice Broke" 
show him to be a master of the intimate rather than the epic, and his usual 
rapport with actors fails him here, except with Julia. 
</P>
<P>
Julia, who brings more to Romero than the script does, seems to draw strength 
and inspiration from the very solitary man he is portraying. "Romero" (rated 
PG-13 for violence and bloodshed) is of greatest interest as a study of a 
skilled professional actor going about his business no matter what. When you 
should be experiencing a sense of universality in the plight of Archbishop 
Romero, you may instead find yourself being impressed with Julia's ability to 
bring passion and meaning to cliches. 
</P>

OPERA REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
A BRAVE NEW 'TOSCA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most opera companies take good old, tired old "Tosca" for granted. 
</P>
<P>
Puccini's magnificently mawkish music seldom fails, even when the hacks have 
their way with it. The creaky but taut old melodrama of passion, love, lust and 
fatal manipulation virtually plays itself. 
</P>
<P>
Just find a reasonable facsimile of a diva who can look imperious, sing "Vissi 
d'arte" flat on her belly, dispatch the evil Scarpia with a picturesque 
flourish of a handy fruit knife and, at whomping-cadence time, leap to the 
backstage mattress from the top of the Castel Sant'Angelo with a semblance of 
suicidal conviction. The rest usually falls more or less into place without 
much fuss. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center Opera, which opened its season with the shabbily wonderful 
little verismo shocker on Wednesday, could have done "Tosca" by the numbers and 
scored an easy popular success in the process. The same company did just that 
in 1985, with some help from the West Berlin Opera. On that forgettable 
occasion, the chief attraction didn't happen to be the soprano, but a romantic 
tenorissimo -- Placido Domingo -- provided compensation as her idealistic 
lover. Basically, it was "Tosca" business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Not this time. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Domingo swapped Cavaradossi's paintbrush for the conductor's baton 
and, contrary to some fears, wielded it very competently. The real news of the 
evening, however, emanated from the stage, where Ian Judge, the director, 
revealed some interesting -- as well as some irksome -- ideas about the piece; 
where John Gunter, the set designer, showed us a compelling -- if occasionally 
troubling -- perspective of Scarpia's Rome, and, most important, where Maria 
Ewing -- Los Angeles' unorthodox Salome -- triumphed over another case of 
anti-type casting. 
</P>
<P>
Judge, who inherited the staging duties from Elijah Moshinsky, who in turn was 
to have taken over from the originally scheduled Peter Hall, stressed 
credibility and intimacy in the interplay of the central characters. He told 
the primitive story briskly and with exceptional clarity. He permitted no poses 
and only a few cliches: a Mephistophelean Scarpia crushing a rose in his fist 
at the climax of the Te Deum, Tosca collapsing conveniently to the floor for 
her greatest hit, the firing squad facing the audience, Capobianco style, at 
Cavaradossi's execution. 
</P>
<P>
Judge's only controversial contribution involved the decision to move the 
action forward a century, to the period when the opera was written. The 1900 
milieu did little harm to the fundamental tone, but it didn't help much, 
either. And it made the crucial reference to Napoleon's victory at Marengo 
ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
Gunter's stark yet imposing sets played gently yet tellingly with stylization 
and disorientation. Angles went slightly askew. Scarpia's study was turned into 
a barren, 
</P>
<P>
stifling chamber dominated by a bloody crucifix. The castle prison looked 
exceptionally bleak and genuinely oppressive. 
</P>
<P>
It was good to be spared the usual essays in wrinkled-canvas realism. Still, a 
few details proved confusing. What was one to make of the ornate picture frame 
that neatly surrounded each of the three scenes? Why did Tosca complain of 
being locked out in the first act, when she could have strolled in through one 
of the open arches on either side of the gate? Why was the action always 
confined to a central wedge that severely restricted sight lines out front? Why 
couldn't the garish lights behind the cyclorama sky in the last act have been 
masked? 
</P>
<P>
Even if some of the desired illusions remained elusive, this was a strikingly 
atmospheric, genuinely dramatic production. Liz da Costa's costumes defined 
character deftly, just as Marie Barrett's shadowy lighting reinforced mood. 
</P>
<P>
Nature did not happen to endow Ewing with the ideal Tosca voice. Her soprano -- 
or is it a pushed-up mezzo? -- has no cutting edge like Maria Callas'. It isn't 
ethereal like Zinka Milanov's or lustrous like Renata Tebaldi's. It isn't even 
sleek like Dorothy Kirsten's or gutsy like Licia Albanese's. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing has to work hard to ride the great climaxes. She has to do some clever 
vocal compensating for weaknesses in the lower register. She has to pace 
herself cannily to sustain the final apostrophe on the parapet. She chops 
phrases in strange places when breath runs short. 
</P>
<P>
And yet it hardly matters. 
</P>
<P>
What does matter is her total commitment, her subtle inflection of the text, 
her shading of the line, her unstinting honesty, generosity and expressive 
intensity. She makes Tosca an exceptionally vulnerable yet impetuous young 
woman from the start. Obsessively in love with Cavaradossi, she can be playful, 
sensuous and dangerously capricious. This heroine commands a sense of humor as 
well as a sense of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Watch her eyes when she spots the fruit knife. Watch her mouth when Scarpia 
touches her. Watch her arms when she gives Cavaradossi last-minute acting 
lessons. Watch how she desperately pins the dying Scarpia to the floor with her 
body, and observe the release of tension and onset of terror in her second-act 
exit. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, perhaps, listen to the natural way she floats the melodic line 
on the words. She permits no parlando distortions, no showy exaggerations, no 
glamorous indulgences. 
</P>
<P>
This challenge, which she is confronting for the first time in her career, 
stretches her resources. Her solutions to some of the inherent problems may 
alarm some purists. Never mind. She is exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Shicoff complements her as a lyrical, sympathetic, youthful, bright-toned 
Cavaradossi who occasionally wants to make bigger tenor-sounds than wisdom 
might dictate. Justino Diaz as Scarpia has abandoned the elegant Titto Gobbi 
imitation he introduced here a decade ago with the New York City Opera; now he 
concentrates, quite effectively, on brutish fervor and Mafioso persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
The strong supporting cast includes Louis Lebherz as an urgent Angelotti, 
Michael Gallup as a Sacristan free of buffo mannerisms, Robin Buck as a 
Spoletta minus caricature villainy, John Atkins as a suavely formidable 
Sciarrone, Lisa Perry as an over-amplified offstage Shepherd and Wayne Shepperd 
as a mellifluous Jailor. 
</P>
<P>
Domingo may let the orchestra play too loud from time to time. He doesn't 
always search for hidden dynamic nuances and, when in doubt, he lapses into 
ponderous tempos. Nevertheless, he conducts this opera -- an opera he must know 
very well -- with welcome authority, breadth and eloquence.

'BREAKING LEGS' AT GLOBE LIMPS ON FRACTURED PREMISE

<P>
Yo, Frankie. Tom Dulack's "Breaking Legs" at the Old Globe Theatre is about 
America's favorite crime family, the Mafia. What would happen if Uncle Tino and 
Uncle Mike decided to back a Broadway play? 
</P>
<P>
First they would change the title to something you can hum, like "The Student 
Prince." Then they'd write in a part for their fat niece who plays the 
accordion. Then they would sit the playwright down for a little family 
conference about the second act. "It needs work." 
</P>
<P>
Funny, right? It's also amusing that our meek playwright (Greg Mullavey) has 
never even attended a wake, although his play concerns a murder. His Mafia pals 
are scandalized. You've never been to a wake and you're Irish? "My family 
wasn't very ethnic." 
</P>
<P>
Uncle Tino (Richard Kneeland) and Uncle Mike (Mike Genovese) are of course very 
ethnic, even to the extent of rubbing out Uncle Frankie (Eddie Zammit) just 
before intermission and ordering his widow the best funeral that money can buy. 
Whom can they get to write the eulogy? Why, the playwright. He's on the 
payroll, isn't he? 
</P>
<P>
There's a moral here about choosing one's benefactors wisely. And there are 
signs that "Breaking Legs" does want to say a little something about how easily 
an intellectual can fall under the power of guys whose impulses are very simple 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
But it also would like to be a flat-out gangster comedy, in the farcical 
tradition of "Three Men on a Horse." As such, it needs a lot of work. Acts I 
and II. 
</P>
<P>
First problem: The premise. Comedy is always sharper when it's absolutely clear 
what the characters want. This isn't established here. We're not sure why the 
mob is diddling around with some college professor's play when they could be 
backing their kind of Broadway show, something with dancing cats in it. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they're trying to get the professor into "The Family" -- to snag him for 
their tough-talking niece, who once sat in his classroom (Sue Giosa -- 
overtones of "Educating Rita" here). But no, that can't be it. They don't 
realize that she's hot for him until Act II. 
</P>
<P>
It can't be that they like his script -- they haven't read it. Maybe they're 
interested in setting up a money-laundering scheme? What we absolutely can't 
believe is that they expect to make a profit here. So why are they wasting 
their time? 
</P>
<P>
Second problem: The plot. It needs thickening. All that happens is that the 
professor vaguely wants out of the deal once he understands who his real 
partners are, and then decides that there are advantages in staying in. 
Something more needs to happen in his journey than a night of passion on his 
ex-student's Castro Convertible. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's clear why the Old Globe's Jack O'Brien decided to close the 
theater's summer season with this little number. It's an audience show, if you 
can get the audience to go along with it. And it gives O'Brien's actors a 
chance to swagger around like dons in "The Godfather," which they do with great 
style. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Genovese is especially impressive as Uncle Mike, who laughs without moving 
his lips. This is a very broad cartoon, with a core of real danger, especially 
when he toys with poor Uncle Frankie, played with "Godfather" intensity by 
Eddie Zammit. 
</P>
<P>
Giosa is equally plausible as the professor's ex-student. She dresses like a 
bimbo (Robert Wojewodski did the costumes) but she knows exactly where she's 
going, and she may well displace Uncle Mike as head of the family. It's a 
surprisingly well-written part, under all that va-va-voom, and Giosa plays it 
with great spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
The professor-playwright's part is dim, and Mullavey struggles to find things 
for the character to do besides look apprehensive. One thing he could do is 
sharpen his speech. It's fine for professors to sputter, but they mustn't 
swallow their syllables. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Faulkner's set is a working Italian restaurant, complete with red-checked 
tablecloths and an ice machine. The food is the real stuff, brought in from a 
local restaurant. The play needs to decide whether it wants to be the real 
stuff, or a cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays Tuesdays-Sundays at 8 p.m., with matinees Saturdays and Sundays at 2 
p.m. Closes Oct. 22. Balboa Park, San Diego. Tickets $18-$25. (619) 239-2255.

"Trump Card," a new syndicated bingo-like TV game show backed by real estate 
tycoon Donald Trump, has been tripped up by some last-minute contractual 
problems. Trump was set to make the official announcement Thursday morning at 
Trump Tower in New York City, but that press conference was canceled late 
Wednesday. However, a Lorimar executive said "Trump Card" is almost sure to be 
on the market in January at the annual National Assn. of Television Program 
Executives convention for a debut next fall. Trump will own a third of the 
program, as will both Lorimar Television and Warner Bros. Domestic Television 
Distribution. ALEENE MacMINN

The Tony-winning musical "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" has taken another detour en 
route to the Shubert Theatre here. The hit Broadway show, which had been 
scheduled to open next April, has been postponed until May, 1991, the producers 
announced Thursday. The troupe that will bring the show here will first play 
Japan in February, 1991. One of the show's original producers is a Japanese 
firm, the Suntory Corp. A brief statement from the producers offered no 
explanation for the postponement but assured audiences "with certainty" that 
the scheduled openings will take place. Ahmanson Theatre subscribers, who have 
been offered the Robbins show as part of their season, should stay tuned.

Country singer Randy Travis and each member of his band face fines of up to 
$10,000 and expulsion from the musicians union for crossing picket lines last 
week in Las Vegas. Musicians are striking over the use of taped music and 
guaranteed work in hotel showrooms. "Randy chose to make his fans happy as 
opposed to making the union happy," a spokesman for the singer said. "Randy 
supports live music over taped music. Originally he wasn't going to cross the 
picket line. But we got hundreds of letters and phone calls from fans -- (and) 
he decided to do it." ALEENE MacMINN

STAGE BEAT : 'INSIGNIFICANCE' AT AL'S BAR; 'JONIN' ' AT HARMAN AVENUE THEATER; 
'MUCH ADO' BY GROUP REPERTORY; 'CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION' AT CAST

It's a fascinating conceit of modern playwrights, this bringing together of 
unlikely cohorts to thresh out philosophical conundrums, and few have carried 
off the trick better than Terry Johnson in the West Coast premiere of his 
"Insignificance" at Al's Bar. 
</P>
<P>
It's a talky little play, but that's just fine when the talk is lucid and 
witty, when the intelligence and poetry of the language so well define the 
pawns in the game and illuminate the author's themes. 
</P>
<P>
The validity of existence is the theorem in question and the premises are 
provided by four minds of undoubted intelligence, albeit hampered by their own 
solipsism. 
</P>
<P>
Their identities are only slightly veiled by their namelessness in the program. 
The Professor is an accurate Einstein, exuding goodness and desperation in Dana 
Gladstone's wealth of detail; the searching, troubled mind of Marilyn Monroe is 
well outlined in Sandra Bogan's Actress; her husband of the moment, the 
Ballplayer, is a joy to watch in the not-so-dumb reality of Robert Lesser's 
portrait, and Matt Roe is as greasy and flannel-mouthed as he can be as the Joe 
McCarthy-cloned Louisiana Senator. 
</P>
<P>
Through the guidance of director Brian Nelson, their summit meeting in a crummy 
1953 Manhattan hotel room is an example of what ensemble playing should be, 
honoring text and texture with affection and integrity, and fully appreciating 
the humor inherent in Johnson's difficult and intricate black comedy. It's a 
play that has to be listened to, but the effort is rewarded in this production. 
</P>
<P>

285-8170.

<P>
'Jonin' ' 
</P>
<P>
Jonin' is a buzz word descriptive of the act of teasing with a patina of 
cruelty, a sort of Don Rickles act of everyday survival. Sometimes it can have 
tragic results, as in Gerard Brown's drama at the Harman Avenue Theater, a 
well-crafted play about growing older and wiser among a group of fraternity 
brothers in their senior year at a black college in Washington. These kids are 
past masters at peer-baiting and make a sport of it. 
</P>
<P>
Education seems secondary in this dorm, as it always does when a playwright 
glances back at his college years; girls (in most cases) are high priority, 
followed closely by the establishment of personality territories the boys will 
take with them into the real world. 
</P>
<P>
But playwright Brown doesn't dig deeply enough into some of the questions the 
situation brings up. It's a sharp play within its lights, but those lights 
could have covered a wider, richer and more valuable area. 
</P>
<P>
Under Stanley Bennett Clay's brisk and resonant direction, each actor connects 
well with the core of his character. Gregory Travis takes his ultra-cool Duffy 
far beyond the character's parameters. Eugene Williams and Donald Willis manage 
fine shading as animals who bring about the ultimate Jonin' that destroys the 
vulnerable and fated Eddie of Craig Thomas. The fine cast includes Kristoff St. 
John as the most promising Steve, Dawn Comer as his girlfriend, Dwight 
Donaldson as a student from Africa, and Rugg Williams as a homosexual who 
mostly studies the floor honcho, Ronald Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 At 522 N. La Brea Ave., Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m., 
through Sept. 24. Tickets: $20; (213) 480-3232. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Much Ado About Nothing' 
</P>
<P>
It's a shame that the promise of Group Repertory's revival of Shakespeare's 
romantic comedy is only partially kept. When the lights come up, Nisa Kellner's 
delightful costumes and director Patricia Lee Willson's bouncing-ball tempos 
bode well for the evening. The period seems late 19th Century, and the action 
seems to take place somewhere between Palermo and Smyrna. The players, for the 
most part, abandon attempts at wrestling with iambic pentameter, opting for a 
natural tone that fits Willson's concept. 
</P>
<P>
Yet only the antic battles of Beatrice (Whitney Vale) and Benedick (Bert 
Rosario) really come to life in the production. Their ease with the words in a 
decidedly anachronistic interpretation and the obvious delight they take in 
their scenes together are totally winning; they could be Sam Levene and Cass 
Daley romping as the bickering lovers, and it works. David Stifel's Dogberry 
also has some honest and funny moments, but the rest of the company is 
defeated, even in Willson's valid unclassical treatment.

<P>
'Conspicuous Consumption' 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Schepps' foray into the problems of weight at the Cast Theater is sadly 
weightless. The central figure Sarah, played by the playwright, is obsessed by 
her weight, overwrought by her lack of romance and fascinated by a co-worker 
whose slimness leaves Sarah by the side of the road in more ways than one. She 
tries pills, diet, aerobics et al., and nothing works. 
</P>
<P>
The play's concerns are forthright and honest but, like a meringue that holds 
its peaks well, the play collapses on contact. The impression that lingers is 
that of a weight-loss commercial kidded on "Saturday Night Live." There is more 
potential nourishment in the subject than the playwright has given the actress 
to digest, and Schepps' performance is too shallow to encourage much empathy. 
</P>
<P>
The most promising moments concern a handsome stud (a nicely detailed Hank 
Azaria) who really digs Sarah's more-than-comfortably-upholstered bones, but 
his attraction to her, for some odd reason, only sends her up the wall and back 
to her therapist. A play about that would make a stronger statement on Schepps' 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Heffner, Maureen Teefy, John Zarchen, Elizabeth Hanley and Eric Poppick 
effectively fill out the catalogue of those driving Sarah to distraction.

IRISH SOLDIERS SPEAK THE POETRY OF INJUSTICE IN 'A FLAG TO FLY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the war between Mexico and the United States in 1846-48, a U.S. 
battalion that was made up mostly of Irish immigrants jumped to the Mexican 
side. Of those soldiers of St. Patrick who were captured, most were whipped 50 
times and branded with a D for deserter on their cheeks -- but 50 of them were 
sentenced to hang. 
</P>
<P>
"A Flag to Fly," Chris Matthews' stunning hourlong drama at the Celtic Arts 
Center about seven of those awaiting the gallows, is a testament to a belief in 
right and justice that is as pertinent as today's headlines in its condemnation 
of jingoistic brutality. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln called the U.S.-Mexican conflict "the sheerest deception," and U.S. 
Grant referred to it as "the most unjust war." The Irish-American battalion, 
the San Patricios, was made up mostly of men who fled Ireland to escape the 
famine and religious persecution, but they soon realized the inequity of the 
American presence in Mexico, which resulted in the annexation of half of Mexico 
into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
If the play has a flaw, it is brevity. Another half hour would give Matthews 
the time to provide further details in the Matthew Brady-like snapshots he has 
taken of his seven prisoners. His program notes say that this is "a very 
stylized version of the full production, without Yankee soldiers, subsets and 
crowd scenes." 
</P>
<P>
While these seven soldiers are enough to make his point without slipping into 
pageantry, we would just like to spend a little more time with them and feel a 
little more of the pain of their 4 1/2-hour wait in their nooses watching the 
final battle of Chapultepec and the raising of the American flag that signaled 
their doom. Johnny, we hardly knew ye. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews also directs with passion and compassion a fine cast, including Mike 
Vaughn, William Brochtrup, Patrick Thornton, Pete Gallatin, Neal Eastman, Chris 
Campbell and Martin Maguire. Elda Maria Lopez appears briefly as a Mexican 
woman who sends her Irish lover off to defend her country. It is ensemble work 
of intricacy and richness and an understanding of the humor and poetry in the 
Irish soul. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's that humor and poetry that sets "A Flag to Fly" apart. In recent 
wars there have been no poets to sing of the brutality and injustice, to make 
us feel deeply about the unknown soldiers we forget too soon. Lately we only 
have windows on the bloodshed and destruction, journalism instead of heartbeat. 
It's the poetry in the hearts of these seven that makes them memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Strauss' intricate lighting, Evan McGraph's realistic sound and Tera Dawn 
Oppenheimer's authentically battered costumes all help to bring this moment of 
heroism into focus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 At 5651 Hollywood Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 3 
p.m., through Sept. 17. Tickets: $10; (213) 462-6844.

An unwavering fascination with rainbow light effects refracting from 
hard-edged, geometric forms has given Larry Bell's sculpture and vapor drawings 
a certain predictability. Surprisingly his newest mixed-media works on canvas 
remain faithful to his love of light as surface yet are also punchy 
explorations of form and space. They put some much needed zip back into Bell's 
Minimalist aesthetic, even while they appear to be trying to find a comfortable 
formula. 
</P>
<P>
Using ultra thin sheets of metal foil adhered by vacuum and heat to primed 
canvas, Bell makes compositions of shimmering opalescent color that 
dematerializes into white canvas or solid pastels. The foil bonds perfectly 
with the canvas yet impossibly appears deeply rumpled, stretched or rippled. 
It's a stunning trompe l'oeil effect. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his repetitive vapor drawings, each image is unique. "Oriental Gardens," 
one of the most successful, is a huge, dynamic arrangement of jagged foil 
fragments and rice papers stuck like wet, wind-blown paper to the infinite 
darkness of a matte black canvas. In this work and "Black Sargent" Bell begins 
to allow passages of flat color or iridescence to open like mystic portals. 
Holes emitting light in the middle of chaos are beguiling enough that we want 
to forgive the way they quickly settle into a pat format. 
</P>
<P>
More problematic, yet perhaps ultimately more satisfying, are the 
Expressionistic flourishes that whip around paintings like the effervescent 
"Ken and Haps." These sweeps of the painter's brush struggle with self control, 
occasionally overwhelming the industrial detachment of the heat-tempered metal 
ground. Still, their humanity is welcome. (Kiyo Higashi Gallery, 8332 Melrose 
Ave., to Sept. 23.)SUVAN GEER

A bill requiring school administrators to notify teachers whenever a student 
with a violent history is assigned to their classroom has been passed 
overwhelmingly by the Assembly. The legislation, by Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Tarzana), would also increase penalties for assaulting a school employee off 
school grounds in retaliation for an act performed in the course of the 
employee's duties at the school. The bill, which passed on a 68-0 vote, was 
prompted by the slaying earlier this year of Hal Arthur, a popular teacher at 
Grant High School in Van Nuys. Arthur was ambushed and shot to death with a 
semiautomatic weapon as he left his Sherman Oaks home for school on March 24.

Reacting to allegations of false testimony by jailhouse informants in criminal 
cases, the state Senate approved a bill that would limit payments to informants 
to $50 and require judges to warn juries to be skeptical of their testimony. 
The measure, authored by Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), is in 
response to news accounts of a jailhouse informant who demonstrated that he 
could invent a convincing confession.

Exxon Corp. abruptly ceased its wildlife rescue and collection efforts off 
environmentally battered Kodiak Island, Alaska, despite a new wave of bird 
deaths there. The firm had already been under fire for deciding to end the 
overall cleanup of its March 24 oil spill by mid-September. The early quitting 
date at the start of the fall bird migration surprised and angered the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, said Paul Burke, assistant spill coordinator for the 
agency in Kodiak. There has been no official response to the criticism from 
Exxon. "We are considering a response," said Ann Frechette, an Exxon 
spokeswoman in Valdez.

A Soviet general who reportedly ordered an army assault that killed 19 
demonstrators in the Soviet Georgian city of Tbilisi in April has been removed 
from his post, officials said. Col. Gen. Igor Rodionov, who was head of the 
Transcaucasian Military District, was replaced by Col. Gen. Valery O. 
Patrikeyev, said an editor at the official Gruzinform news agency in Tbilisi, 
the capital of the Georgian republic. Nationalists have accused Rodionov of 
ordering soldiers armed with shovels and irritating gas to attack a crowd in 
Tbilisi on April 9. Rodionov has defended his actions by saying that the 
protest turned into a "pure orgy," with anti-Soviet slogans, appeals to 
overturn the government and appeals to "exterminate Communists."

Two Soviet cosmonauts successfully docked their Soyuz TM-8 spacecraft with the 
Mir orbiting space station, the official Tass news agency said. "Everything is 
in order on board, and the cosmonauts feel well," Tass said. The Mir station 
has been vacant for more than four months. Commander Alexander S. Viktorenko 
and engineer Alexander A. Serebrov, who blasted off from the Baikonur 
Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia early Wednesday, will remain aboard Mir for 
six months. Along with the cosmonauts, scientists are sending up two modules to 
expand the station's living space and upgrade its scientific capabilities.

Congress should not yet close the books on the Iran-Contra affair, the former 
chairman of the House committee that investigated the scandal said. In a letter 
to Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), 
Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) asked that the committee begin "a continuing 
investigation" of new documents and other evidence that may have surfaced in 
the trial of former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North or which may surface during 
other upcoming trials of Iran-Contra figures. "Most importantly, we still do 
not understand precisely what were the roles in these events of (Ronald) 
Reagan, (then) Vice President Bush and other top Reagan Administration 
officials," Hamilton said in the letter.

The Soviet Union is reassessing a 30-year-old policy of military aid to Africa 
that, with little other forms of assistance, has resulted in a loss of 
influence on the continent, Jane's Soviet Intelligence Review said. A detailed 
analysis by the London publication that specializes in East-West affairs said 
that Soviet influence in Africa is waning because, instead of providing 
development aid as the West does, the Kremlin has done little more since 1960 
than provide weapons for civil wars. Moscow's major achievement in Africa has 
been to prevent the overthrow of Communist governments in Angola and Ethiopia, 
its two closest allies in Africa, Jane's said.

DEFENDANT CONTENDS NARCOTICS DEPUTIES GRABBED THOUSANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A Mexican national who pleaded guilty to laundering drug money has claimed that 
tens of thousands of dollars seized when he was arrested by three sheriff's 
narcotics agents was never turned over as evidence, a federal source said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The three deputies -- James R. Bauder, Eufrasio G. Cortez and Terrell H. Amers 
-- and six other members of a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department narcotics 
team were suspended last Friday pending completion of local and federal 
inquiries into the alleged skimming of seized drug money. 
</P>
<P>
"There is money missing from this case, the exact amount I can't tell you," 
said defense attorney Victor Sherman, who said he will file a motion to 
withdraw client Carlos Luis Soto's guilty plea next week. 
</P>
<P>
Soto, 20, was arrested last November when the three deputies seized large 
amounts of cash from his pickup truck after it left a Pomona warehouse where 
nearly 700 pounds of cocaine was found. A variety of drug charges against two 
co-defendants were withdrawn by federal prosecutors Tuesday because the cases 
relied on the testimony of suspended deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Soto told Sherman that the $135,000 the deputies turned over as evidence was 
far short of the amount Soto was carrying. The shortage is tens of thousands of 
dollars, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"This happens all the time in these (drug) cases," Sherman said. "You mention 
it to the prosecutors and they just shrug. They're not interested." 
</P>
<P>
Sherman would not say whether he filed a complaint in the Soto case. But a law 
enforcement source said that Sherman complained several times to the U.S. 
attorney's office in Los Angeles, which prosecuted Soto. The source did not 
know what action, if any, was taken on the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Gary A. Feess declined comment on any case involving the suspended 
deputies, spokeswoman Grace Denton said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Shinee, attorney for the union representing some of the named deputies, 
said he would have no immediate comment on the Soto case, or any other 
allegations against the suspended deputies. Deputy Bauder has denied any 
misconduct, but the other deputies have declined comment or could not be 
reached by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement sources said they were not certain whether Soto's complaints 
last fall had any impact on a sheriff's inquiry into the nine-member narcotics 
team. But his allegations followed closely an internal audit last October that 
Sheriff Sherman Block has said revealed drug money was missing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allegations Spurred Probes 
</P>
<P>
Sources have said the Sheriff's Department inquiry and subsequent 
investigations by the FBI and IRS were prompted, in part, by cases such as 
Soto's. 
</P>
<P>
One federal source, quoting FBI narcotics investigators, said the 
money-skimming case was triggered by an anonymous letter that said there were 
"dirty cops" in the Sheriff's Department, and the letter was traced to a 
sheriff's copying machine. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was expanded, the source said, after dealers in two different 
drug cases alleged that more money had been seized from them than was turned in 
as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials and federal investigators who have taken over the probe 
declined to comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Eight deputies and a sergeant, all with the department at least nine years, 
were relieved of duty in what Block says is probably the biggest scandal during 
his seven-year tenure as head of the nation's largest sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Amers, Bauder and Cortez, the suspended officers include Sgt. 
Robert Sobel, Nancy A. Brown, Ronald E. Daub, John C. Dickenson, Daniel M. 
Garner and Michael J. Kaliterna. 
</P>
<P>
A federal law enforcement source said the amount allegedly stolen by deputies 
during the past year could exceed $200,000. There was no indication that 
narcotics were also stolen, according to the department. 
</P>
<P>
While Los Angeles County's top drug prosecutor has said repeatedly that there 
is no indication that the scandal will jeopardize any cases, defense attorneys 
contended Thursday that some cases will be affected by the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald S. Miller, an attorney in an ongoing San Fernando Valley drug case, said 
that his client claims $150,000 in cash and about 200 gold coins are missing 
after being seized in an April raid by six of the suspended deputies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contends $250,000 Taken 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that 26-year-old Mitchell Podwal, who faces cocaine trafficking 
charges, claims that about $250,000 in cash and some 1,000 gold coins were in 
his Northridge home when it was raided. The investigative team, headed by 
Bauder, reported seizing about $100,000 in cash and 730 gold coins of $5, $10 
and $20 denominations. Also part of the raid were deputies Amers, Sobel, 
Cortez, Daub and Kaliterna, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he has filed no complaint with the district attorney's office, 
because "nobody wants to listen to these claims" by accused drug dealers. They 
are not taken seriously, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney has filed suit in an attempt to keep the cash, claiming 
the money came from drug sales. Podwal maintains the money came from his work 
as a manager for rock bands and that the coins were gifts from relatives or 
belong to friends, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations in the Soto and Podwal cases are similar those lodged in 1987, when 
a defendant in a cocaine trafficking case contended that $140,000 was missing 
after a drug raid in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Cortez and Garner were among six officers who searched two residences on Sept. 
5, 1986, as part of an investigation into a suspected Colombian cocaine 
trafficking operation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amounts Differ 
</P>
<P>
The deputies reported finding 264 pounds of cocaine plus $120,005 in cash and 
more than $212,000 in negotiable checks. However, one of the defendants -- 
Jaime Ramos -- testified in Superior Court in February, 1987, that there was 
actually $260,000 in drug money along with the checks at the two residences. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos' attorney in the case, Mitchell W. Egers, said he reported the 
discrepancy at the time to the district attorney's special investigations 
division but never heard anything more about it. 
</P>
<P>
Sandi Gibbons, a district attorney's spokeswoman, said Thursday that she could 
find no record of any such complaint filed with her office. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Dion Morrow eventually ruled that the confiscated cocaine, 
cash and checks could not be used as evidence on grounds that they were 
obtained with an illegal search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors appealed the ruling, but Ramos and the two other defendants pleaded 
guilty and were sentenced to state prison.

U.S. INDICTS FIGURE IN CAMARENA MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted a prominent Mexican businessman on 
three counts of lying to a federal grand jury that is looking into the 
February, 1985, murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena, the U.S. attorney's 
office announced. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Zuno Arce, 59, the brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis 
Echeverria, was charged with perjuring himself before the grand jury twice on 
Aug. 24 and once on Aug. 31, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment says that Zuno Arce lied on Aug. 24 when he denied knowing 
Rafael Caro Quintero and when he denied knowing Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo. The 
indictment says that Zuno Arce also gave a false statement when he again denied 
knowing Caro on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Both Caro and Fonseca, Mexican drug kingpins, are in jail in Mexico City in 
connection with the 1985 torture and murder of Camarena. The DEA agent was 
tortured in a Guadalajara house purchased by Caro in January, 1985, less than a 
month before the murder. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents filed in San Antonio, Tex., last month, Zuno Arce 
owned the home until Jan. 11, 1985, when he sold it to another man who, in 
turn, sold it to Caro. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno Arce, held for four weeks as a witness in Los Angeles, is in custody in 
San Antonio pending an Immigration and Naturalization Service hearing on 
whether he can be deported as an "excludable alien." Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Manuel Medrano who is handling the Zuno Arce case said he notified the U.S. 
attorney in San Antonio Thursday that the indictment had been filed here and 
asked him to return Zuno Arce to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll seek to detain him without bail when he's brought back here," Medrano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno Arce faces a possible fine of up to $250,000 and a prison term of up to 
five years on each perjury count. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's indictment marks the latest turn in a topsy-turvy legal battle 
between the government and Zuno Arce. He was arrested in San Antonio on Aug. 9 
by INS agents after he had flown in from Mexico and an airport official 
discovered that he was on a list of reputed drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
He was brought to Los Angeles for questioning as "a material witness" in the 
Camarena case and held 25 days without bail until U.S. District Judge Edward 
Rafeedie ordered him released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors had asked Rafeedie to hold Zuno Arce here without bail 
until October when a former Mexican policeman, Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, is 
scheduled to go on trial for allegedly participating in the Camarena murder. 
Rafeedie said there was no justification for holding Zuno Arce as a potential 
witness in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours after Rafeedie ordered Zuno Arce set free, he was informed that the 
INS wanted him back in San Antonio for a hearing on whether he is an "an 
excludable alien" as an alleged drug trafficker. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno Arce, his wife and his attorneys have consistently maintained that he is 
not a drug trafficker, had no connection with the Camarena murder and that the 
government is over-reaching in the case. Edward M. Medvene, one of his lawyers, 
said Tuesday that the assertion that Zuno Arce was a drug trafficker was 
"outrageous" and lacked any factual basis. 
</P>
<P>
The Times was unable to obtain immediate comment from Zuno Arce or his lawyers 
Thursday after the indictment was announced.

CHP OFFICERS HEAR SHOTS, WOUND 2 IN ATHENS GUNFIGHT

Two suspects were wounded in a shoot-out with California Highway Patrol 
officers that erupted after the officers heard shots from the suspects that 
struck another man outside a bar in the Athens area east of Hawthorne, Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the suspects and an accomplice fled the shooting scene in a 
car, but were taken into custody about a block away when they flagged down 
sheriff's deputies to seek treatment for their wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the incident began about 11:35 p.m. Wednesday, as CHP officers 
Steven Reyes and Ralph Gomez were investigating a minor collision across from 
the Name of the Game bar at 120th Street and Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
As the officers busied themselves with the accident, an argument broke out in 
the bar's parking lot, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Mack, 23, who lives nearby, said he was walking into the bar after 
moving his car when shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing I knew, I was hit," Mack recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, who said he had no idea whether he was an intended target of the attack 
or was accidentally shot, was struck in the leg and arm. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said that when the two CHP officers looked in the direction of the 
shots, they saw a small, black car traveling north out of the parking lot, 
toward them. 
</P>
<P>
"As they were taking cover, (Reyes and Gomez) heard several more shots being 
fired in their direction," the deputies said in their report of the incident. 
"They both returned fire. Each officer fired four rounds from (his) duty 
revolver, striking the suspects an unknown amount of times." 
</P>
<P>
After driving about a block east on 120th Street, the suspects stopped, and two 
of them got out of their automobile to flag down a passing patrol car from the 
Lennox sheriff's station, investigators said. Moments later, when the deputies 
heard a radio broadcast describing the gun battle with the CHP officers, the 
three suspects were taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were identified as Ricky Lewis, 24, of Los Angeles, Jeffrey 
Howard, 26, of Compton, and Devlyn Cole, 21, of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was being held without bail after being booked at the Lennox station on 
suspicion of attempted murder of a peace officer. Howard, who was shot twice in 
the neck and once in the face, and Cole, who was shot in the abdomen, were 
reported in guarded condition at County-USC Medical Center prison ward, where 
both were booked on suspicion of attempted murder.

GANGS BLAMED FOR ASSAULT-RIFLE ATTACK THAT KILLED BOY, 7, TEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A simmering argument between two gang factions fighting over a small section of 
South-Central Los Angeles was blamed Thursday for an assault-rifle attack that 
killed a 7-year-old boy and a suspected gang member. 
</P>
<P>
First-grader Lamont Compton died Wednesday in a spray of bullets fired from two 
AK-47 assault rifles aimed at suspected gang member Melvin Morris Gentry, 17. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry was fatally wounded in the attack, which took place just a few hours 
after he was released from the custody of juvenile authorities. Gentry was 
waiting for his first glimpse of his infant son when the shooting took place. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police investigators said the attack was apparently prompted by an 
argument between two Crips gang factions that claim adjoining territory in a 
low-income neighborhood near where the Harbor Freeway crosses Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry was allegedly a member of one of the factions. Police described Lamont 
as an innocent victim. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry was shot in the stomach as he stood next to a car containing Lamont, his 
mother and another woman. The car was parked in front of an apartment complex 
at 11107 S. Broadway, the home of a relative of Gentry. 
</P>
<P>
Lamont was playing in the back seat of the car when he was shot in the head and 
neck, police said. The mother was visiting friends who lived in the building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woman Injured 
</P>
<P>
A passenger in the car, Judy Moore, 29, was hit in the arm by the flurry of 
bullets intended for Gentry, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two gunmen escaped by running through the apartment complex to a blue pickup 
truck that was parked behind the rental units, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, an hysterical Elaine Compton, 36, hurriedly tried to drive 
Lamont and Moore to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. But she lost 
control and drove the car into a curb a few blocks from the shooting scene, 
causing several tires to blow out, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were taken to the hospital by ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
No suspects in the attack had been identified late Thursday. But Police Lt. 
Doug Collison said he is optimistic that arrests will be made. He described the 
attack as a "payback" by one gang against the other. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Lamont's family, who live on San Pedro Street about a mile from the 
shooting scene, were reluctant Thursday to discuss the tragedy. But others 
described the boy as a friendly child who enjoyed playing with children living 
in the Broadway apartment complex when taken there by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry had been in court a few hours before the shooting, Collison said. He did 
not know what charges Gentry had been facing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting to See Son 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Miller, manager of the 16-unit apartment complex, said Gentry had been 
picked up from Juvenile Hall earlier Wednesday by the relative who lives in the 
Broadway apartment. He said the youth was waiting for his mother to come to the 
complex and bring his 2-week-old son, Melvin Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"Melvin had been out of the youth home for just a couple of hours. He had never 
seen his new son before," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he had looked toward the front of the apartment complex a minute or 
so before he heard 10 shots ring out and had noticed Lamont playing on the back 
seat of his mother's parked car. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very happy. He was jumping up and down on the seat," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for both victims were pending. Miller, a gospel singer and 
minister of music at the Peaceful Will Baptist Church, said he has volunteered 
to help arrange separate services for the two boys. 
</P>
<P>
"I agreed to get involved because somebody's got to care," he said.

<P>
Two separate events on Thursday recognized the work of young artists. The 
Pepsi-Cola Co., in announcing renovation of 10 neighborhood parks in the 
county, chose 31 winning posters by children ages 5 to 12 depicting the 
artists' designs for a park. At the city's Junior Arts Center at 4800 Hollywood 
Blvd., a exhibit of the top 48 entries in McDonald's Hispanic Heritage Art 
Contest opened. The free exhibit will be on display through Oct. 8, when it 
goes on tour to other cities.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN PLEADS GUILTY IN HOUSING SWINDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Anaheim woman pleaded guilty Thursday to embezzling $83,000 in government 
money intended for poor tenants being displaced from their South Los Angeles 
homes -- a swindle federal prosecutors said illustrates the kind of oversight 
that has mushroomed into the scandal at the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
Juanita Maria Tachvighi, 44, admitted that she stole HUD funds that should have 
been paid to 10 families who were being ousted from their apartments by a 
rehabilitation project, Assistant U.S. Atty. Adam Schiff said. 
</P>
<P>
Tachvighi, who has agreed to repay the money, pleaded guilty in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles to five counts of embezzling federal funds and three 
counts of theft of government property. She faces up to 80 years in prison and 
a $2-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
Tachvighi had contracted with a Los Angeles County agency to provide relocation 
services for the tenants whose apartment building had been targeted for 
renovation. But between July, 1986, and early 1988, according to Schiff, she 
funneled many of the agency's checks into her own bank account, leaving tenants 
to struggle with debts and higher rents.

BROTHER, CAN YOU SPARE A COUPON?; 
</P>
<P>
SKID ROW'S WEINGART CENTER COOKS UP A NOVEL WAY OF ASSISTING HUNGRY PEOPLE OF 
THE STREETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maxene Johnston had come downtown for dinner and a movie when the panhandler 
approached her, begging for money. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt assaulted, insulted," she recalled. "I thought, 'This makes me feel 
uncomfortable.' " 
</P>
<P>
As president of the Weingart Center Assn. and doyenne of the private, nonprofit 
group's 600-bed service facility at 6th and San Pedro streets, Johnston is 
surrounded daily by poor people, and she understands their problems. 
</P>
<P>
But as a well-dressed, successful businesswoman, she also understands from 
personal experience what she calls the "assault on the conscience" that 
panhandlers pose for the public. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston mulled that discomfort along with other problems she was brainstorming 
-- how to feed hungry street people and get them to Weingart Center for job 
counseling or health care, and what to do about a $200,000 annual deficit in 
the center's food program. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I just sort of woke up one morning and said 'Food coupons!' " she said 
this week in her 12th-floor office overlooking Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
Selling coupons to businesses for distribution to their employees, she thought, 
could accomplish three things: 
</P>
<P>
* Help the public (the employees) feel good by handing out a free meal instead 
of money, which a panhandler might use for drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
* Help the panhandler by assuring him a free nutritious meal, and motivating 
him to visit the center where additional help is available. 
</P>
<P>
* Help the Center Cafe break even. 
</P>
<P>
So, she launched a pilot program last spring, asking center board members to 
distribute coupons through their downtown businesses or law firms. 
</P>
<P>
When the results were tallied at the end of June, 1,390 of the $2.50 coupons 
had been sold to businesses or individuals, and 555 had been redeemed for 
breakfast, lunch or dinner in the spiffy Center Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston knew she had a winner when she offered some change to a panhandler 
outside the Ketcham YMCA atop Bunker Hill one day and was asked by the 
disappointed beggar: "Don't you have one of them Weingart coupons?" Center food 
service director Jane F. Sieck found that the coupons brought new faces to the 
food lines, which could eventually lower production costs. She said each 
complete meal, priced at $2.50 to walk-in customers, costs about $3 to produce. 
Now serving 300 to 700 meals a day, Sieck said the cafe could easily serve 
1,000 with the same labor force, reducing the per-meal cost. 
</P>
<P>
Because even the unredeemed coupons were paid for, the coupon project helped 
defray the deficit for meals actually served. 
</P>
<P>
And, her worst fear was allayed when the coupons were redeemed only a few at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out very well," she said, "because they didn't all come in the next 
day and say, 'Let's have lunch!' " 
</P>
<P>
Now Johnston and her board are brainstorming again about launching a full-scale 
coupon program, or, as she puts it, "How to get the word out and the money in." 
</P>
<P>
She is ready to tailor the program to any group's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
The downtown office of the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. employees 
said they wanted to help, but did not particularly want to hand out coupons to 
panhandlers. So she worked out a plan in which the employees will raise $30,000 
to buy food coupons and give them to Para Los Ninos, a Skid Row service agency, 
for distribution to needy children and families. 
</P>
<P>
During the pilot program, some businesses paid for the coupons but chose to 
donate them back to Weingart Center. Because most of the center's programs 
provide beds and counseling but no food, Johnston put the coupons to good use. 
</P>
<P>
A typical recipient was Pascale Summers, 20, a Parisian who had moved to New 
York to start school, then married an American and came to California with him. 
Homeless and penniless, the couple obtained beds at Weingart Center but still 
needed food. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for a job, and my stomach was growling," said Summers, who has 
subsequently found work. "I was ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
A man waiting for counseling at the center, who did not give his name, looked 
with interest at a sample coupon Johnston showed him. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority would use them," he said. "Some would sell them to somebody else 
who would use them to come down here and eat. It may go through about five 
people, but people would eat with it." 
</P>
<P>
Sieck said a few of the coupons received had been tattered, indicating that 
they may have gone through several hands. But she believes that most of the 
people fed were the original coupon recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Those handing out the coupons seemed even more enthusiastic than the 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Center general counsel Timothy F. Ryan said his law firm, McLaughlin &amp; 
Irvin, bought coupons and distributed them to employees -- particularly females 
-- to hand out near their office at 8th Street and Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our female staff are intimidated by the panhandlers," Ryan said, "and 
we thought this was a way we could help them." 
</P>
<P>
Both individuals and companies in the pilot program agreed that they would buy 
more coupons, although Ryan suggested that companies could better afford the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
"The $2.50 might be a lot for an individual who would ordinarily give a 
panhandler a quarter," he said. "But for a firm, this is a nice way to make a 
contribution." 
</P>
<P>
Judith L. Sweeney, an associate with the financial management firm McKinsey 
&amp; Co. at 400 S. Hope St. on Bunker Hill, bought 20 of the coupons and 
handed them out at lunch or dinner hour near her office over a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Some were receptive," she said, describing the panhandlers' reaction. "When I 
said the coupon was good for a free meal, they were very, very excited and they 
said, 'Really?' 
</P>
<P>
"Others were clearly looking for money," Sweeney said. "They just looked 
disgruntled. And a couple of people did refuse to take them. They just said 
no." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney said she occasionally gives panhandlers food but never hands out money. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a firm belief that the best way to deal with the homeless in Los 
Angeles is through institutions," she said. "By handing out the coupons, you 
are supporting the institutions, and not the habits of the homeless that I 
might not approve of, like drinking and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people don't want to give out cash," said her colleague, Rick Beckett, 
who found 19 buyers among the 20 people he solicited in their office. "But most 
people want to do something. And this is a good alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Center board member Dean Weiner, a partner in the law firm O'Melveny &amp; 
Myers on Bunker Hill, said he never gives panhandlers money but he felt good 
handing out coupons. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a bit of a soft touch and don't just like walking away from someone 
without giving him anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The conventional wisdom is that it is not a good idea to give cash to a 
panhandler because it doesn't . . . help him get off the street. But the coupon 
directs him to a place where the goal is to help him reach self-sufficiency one 
way or the other."

SHERIFF'S DEPT. SUED BY WOMAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEPUTY CHARGES SEX HARASSMENT, BIAS AGAINST FEMALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A female deputy filed suit Thursday against the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, charging that fellow deputies and supervisors have engaged in a 
wide range of sexual harassment and discriminatory practices against the 
department's 742 female officers. 
</P>
<P>
The class-action suit alleges, among other things, that female deputies are 
called derogatory names and are not given the same field training experience as 
men, that their career advancement is slower, and that training films 
portraying bare-breasted women are shown. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed Thursday in Superior Court by Laura Beard, a 7 1/2-year 
veteran. It seeks a permanent bar against discriminatory practices and calls 
for a formal policy to prohibit harassment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge's Ruling 
</P>
<P>
The action comes less than a year after a judge -- responding to complaints 
made by another female deputy -- called for improvement in the department's 
promotion practices with respect to women. 
</P>
<P>
Beard says she knows of two other female deputies who have hired attorneys and 
taken steps to file similar suits. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an offensive and hostile atmosphere that female deputies are forced 
to work under," said Dennis M. Harley, Beard's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Doug McClure, commander of the Sheriff's Information Bureau, declined to 
discuss details of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"The department has just received a copy of the suit. It has not yet been 
reviewed, and therefore we have no comment to make at this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beard, who has held several positions within the department, now works as an 
instructor in the sheriff's SANE program, a substance abuse school education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"The fear of . . . retaliation has stopped a lot of women deputies from saying 
anything for a long time. I was of the same opinion until it got so personal. 
I'm not a good victim. Enough is enough. I finally had to say something," Beard 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Derogatory Remarks 
</P>
<P>
She alleges that from the time she began working for the Sheriff's Department 
in 1982, she was subjected to various "rude, crude and derogatory" remarks 
about women and was called names in front of supervisors and others. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleges that when Beard complained about problems to her 
superiors she was subjected to what is called "stacking" of radio calls, the 
deliberate assignment of more radio calls than can reasonably be handled. 
Harley said the practice is a common one used to "punish individual employees 
for conduct which is viewed as being outside the 'code of brotherhood.' " 
</P>
<P>
Once, Beard allegedly was sent on a radio call involving a man with a gun 
without adequate backup. "It was a not-so-subtle way to tell her to wise up," 
Harley said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no program by which the confidential complaints of sexual harassment 
could be made, to protect victims and witnesses against retaliation," Harley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sexist cartoons and pictures were often put on bulletin boards and passed 
around the stations, according to the suit. Jokes indicating that women are 
incapable of making appropriate decisions were often told, the suit also 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
A driver-safety training film depicts a bare-breasted woman to make a point 
that women can cause male deputies undue distraction while they are on the job, 
Harley said. 
</P>
<P>
Harley also charged that the Sheriff's Department newsletter printed articles 
of an "absurd juvenile nature." He mentioned, for example, a story about a 
female deputy who allegedly made references to the size of her breasts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Court Order 
</P>
<P>
The earlier lawsuit led last year to a federal court order calling for the 
department to promote more women. That order prohibited the department from 
promoting any deputies to the rank of sergeant until it instituted more 
equitable promotion procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Beard had earlier taken formal steps to protest conditions in the department 
when she filed a complaint with the state Department of Fair Employment and 
Housing in 1988. After an investigation, state officials found "insufficient 
evidence to prove violations of law in respect to her allegations," said Steve 
White, department senior consultant. However, he said "that doesn't mean there 
wasn't a violation, but not enough for us to pursue at that time." 
</P>
<P>
Beard's suit also alleges that: 
</P>
<P>
* There are few females in training positions or specialized units; there is a 
quota on the number of female deputies that will be used in certain units or 
assignments; females without patrol experience cannot transfer out of a jail or 
other custody facility -- not considered prestige positions -- and do not 
receive promotions as easily as men. Having female deputies serve more time in 
jails is a detriment to career advancement. 
</P>
<P>
* Female deputies are not permitted the same field training experience as males 
and are not permitted the same facilities for physical training. Female patrol 
officers are usually not allowed to work together as partners. 
</P>
<P>
* Upon completion of training, females are typically assigned to work traffic 
car radio positions, assignments also not considered desirable. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department does have a written non-discrimination policy, but it 
is "without teeth," Harley said. "It's not been acted upon from the top down. 
The top brass say they don't want this discrimination going on, but they have 
done little to stop it."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: HANSCOM WINS SURF KAYAK TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Hanscom of San Diego routed the field in the World Kayak Surf 
Championships this past week in Cardiff, Wales, scoring 546 points, 27 more 
than the second-place finisher. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive year Hanscomb has taken the title, but the 
victory was somewhat bittersweet. The U.S. team, coached by Hanscom, managed 
only a third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I would have been happier if we were also able to repeat as team 
champions," Hanscom said. "However, after our upset win last year, I knew the 
Europeans would work hard to beat us this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I am obviously elated about my individual title." 
</P>
<P>
England and Wales finished first and second in the team competition. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma Nazarene College opened its second season under Coach Barbara 
Rozendal with an easy nonleague victory at Mt. St. Mary's, 15-9, 15-5, 15-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Crusaders were led by Roberta Silva, who had six service aces; Liz 
Villanueva, five kills, and Tracy Daniels, 16 assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we could have played a lot better," Rozendal said. "At times we 
weren't playing together as a team, but it was a good win, especially for our 
first game after practicing only a week and a half." 
</P>

<P>
SAN DIEGUITO OFFENSE TO TEST SOUTHWEST DEFENSE IN OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, San Dieguito High and Southwest played in one of the top 
football games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the third quarter, the game was tied, 10-10. Each team then 
scored two touchdowns, and Southwest held a 25-24 lead. 
</P>
<P>
With less then a minute to play, sophomore Sean Newcomer caught a 30-yard 
scoring pass to give San Dieguito a 32-25 victory that would eventually propel 
it into the 3-A playoffs with a 5-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a barn-burner," said Coach Ed Burke, entering his fifth 
season at San Dieguito. "We were lucky to get out of that one." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7:30 at San Dieguito, the Mustangs and Red Raiders play each other 
for the first time since that game. 
</P>
<P>
While revenge could be on the minds of Southwest players who would have been 
sophomores in '87, both teams are looking to build on successful 1988 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito is coming off an 8-3 season in which they lost to eventual 
champion Morse, 14-6, in the 3-A quarterfinals. The Mustangs had the 
seventh-best offense in the county, averaging 25.3 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest established itself as the county's No. 1 defensive team, allowing 
just 7.6 points per game during a 9-3 season. The Raiders also lost in the 
quarterfinals, 28-0, to Orange Glen, the 3-A runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest should again be strong defensively with returning standouts Laurence 
Estes (defensive back), Jermaine Brown (linebacker) and Mike Johnson and 
Fernando Villalboza (defensive line). 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito will counter with quarterback Bryan Thistle, running back Mike 
Henry, tackle Kevin Barres and guard Brad Emery leading the wing-T offense. 
</P>
<P>
Having met three times in the past four years, Burke and Carl Parrick, 
Southwest's ninth-year coach, respect each other's programs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Parrick: "Preparing for San Dieguito is preparing for a well-coached team. 
That's what I keep telling my kids." 
</P>
<P>
And Burke: "Carl and Greg Raby (defensive coordinator) do a superior job down 
there."

DOW OFF 12.91 AS LATE STOCK RALLY FIZZLES

<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices fell Thursday, propelled by a late burst of computerized program 
trading that extended the market's losing streak to three days. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up about eight points in the early 
going, was down 12.91 at 2,706.88 by the close. 
</P>
<P>
That extended its loss over the last three sessions to 45.21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues and declines ran about even in nationwide trading of New York 
Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 713 up, 714 down and 569 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was 160.16 million shares, compared to 161.80 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the decline was further indication of the market's move to 
consolidate its gains. 
</P>
<P>
"If the market isn't ready for a correction now, it never will be," said George 
Adler, Banc One Asset Management's head of portfolio management. 
</P>
<P>
A number of forecasters have been predicting a correction after the recent 
gains in the Dow index, which two weeks ago smashed a 2-year-old record. Last 
Friday, the Dow rose 14.82 to again close at a record 2,752.09. 
</P>
<P>
Adler said that stock prices were digesting their recent gains and that the 
fundamentals of the market remained sound. 
</P>
<P>
"People are still buying stocks. Money continues to flow into this market," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Spence, director of Salomon Bros.' technical analysis group, said he 
does not detect any broad-based selling by institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that after this brief consolidation, the market is going to attempt to 
push higher. (But) it will be a very selective move to the upside," said 
Spence. 
</P>
<P>
But James Andrews, head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott, 
said he believes that the market may have reached the upper end of its trading 
range. 
</P>
<P>
"September and October is generally a consolidating period," Andrews said. "The 
bias leans toward the sell side." 
</P>
<P>
Allergan led the NYSE active list, down 3 3/4 at 20 3/4 on volume of more than 
3.16 million shares. The company said its sales this year wouldn't grow as much 
as it previously projected. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany jumped 6 1/8 to 60 3/8. Financier Donald J. Trump received regulatory 
clearance to invest in the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chip industrials included Philip Morris, down 2 at 164 
1/4; Procter &amp; Gamble, down 1 1/4 at 124 3/4; International Business 
Machines, down 1/2 at 116 1/4, and General Electric, down 5/8 at 56 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Applied Biosystems tumbled 3 3/4 to 24 3/4 in the over-the-counter market. The 
company said its earnings for the quarter ending Sept. 30 would fall short of 
their level in the comparable period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, a weaker yen and softer bond prices again rattled the stock market, 
depressing stock prices. The 225-share Nikkei average lost 118.75 points to 
close at 34,152.56. 
</P>
<P>
On the London Stock Exchange, shares recovered strongly from the previous day's 
steep fall. Dealers said the market was lifted by a batch of good corporate 
results and an early modest rally on Wall Street, although this later ran out 
of steam. The Financial Times 100-share index closed at 2,415.9, up 25.1. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were little changed in uneventful trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was unchanged from Wednesday, with 
its yield remaining at 8.10%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there was little activity in the absence of market-moving 
economic news. Traders are awaiting government data due to be released late 
next week on August retail sales, inflation and merchandise trade. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a thin market," said William Sullivan, director of money market 
research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues were unchanged to 3/32 point higher, intermediate maturities slipped 
1/32 point to 1/16 point, and long-term issues were unchanged, according to 
Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 8.938%, down from 9% late Wednesday.

'LONESOME' TRACES ELVIS' RISE, DEMISE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The single most striking image in Alan Bleasdale's "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" 
is the sight of the young Elvis Presley lovingly singing "Are You Lonesome 
Tonight?" to the older, drugged out, bloated man he was to become. 
</P>
<P>
It is a moment that lifts this British-born show, now in its American premiere 
at the San Diego Repertory Theatre, more than a cut above the gaudy tributes 
that usually pass for commentary on Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
To Bleasdale's credit, he dives into the Presley mythology with both eyes open 
and comes up with some of the threads that connect Presley's early 
rags-to-riches story to the tale of the self-destructive man who died, 
suddenly, a dozen years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He captures the poverty of Presley's youth, alludes in a flashback to the shame 
of seeing his father locked up for writing a bad check, lingers over his 
mother's constant reminder of the twin he had who died at birth and dwells on 
the theme of abandonment -- by the brother who died, his mother who died when 
he was in the Army, and his wife and friends who left him one by one. 
</P>
<P>
The richest ore Bleasdale finds is the groping on the part of the aging Presley 
to 
</P>
<P>
come to terms with his younger self. 
</P>
<P>
But Bleasdale glides over the character of the young Presley, using him chiefly 
to sing some of Presley's greatest hits, such as "Heartbreak Hotel" and "Good 
Rockin' Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Why did the young Presley give up 50% of his earnings to his manager, Col. Tom 
Parker? How did his relationship with wife Priscilla begin, falter and end? 
Instead of seeing the older Presley remembering his mother's death, could we 
not see the younger Elvis experiencing it? 
</P>
<P>
Even with these gaping holes, "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" seems the best stage 
treatment of Presley to date. Director George Ferencz brings out the tension 
between the older and younger Presleys and between the semi-stupor of the life 
inside Presley's Memphis estate, Graceland, and the seedy hotel where Presley's 
former bodyguard and friend plots to betray him. 
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights for any Elvis fan will be the nearly dozen rousing songs, 
powerfully sung both by Rick Sparks, who does a remarkable job in re-creating 
Presley's "1968 Comeback Special," and by Sam Woodhouse, producing director of 
the San Diego Rep, who makes his first appearance on the Lyceum Stage as the 
older Presley. An on-stage four-piece band, under the direction of Bob Jewett, 
backs up the songs masterfully, picking up the beat and fading, sometimes into 
silence, when appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The Elvises are also well supported by Drew Tombrello as Duke, the friend who 
betrays him, and Duane Daniels as Duke's dimwitted pal, Jerry. Brothers Tavis 
Ross and J. Michael Ross bring intelligence and depth to two of Presley's 
friends at Graceland, torn between the desire to stand by him and the need to 
flee rather than watch what he is doing to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Dunnam radiates devilish ill will as Col. Parker, but his character, as 
written by Bleasdale, is the most flat and caricatured of the roles. Lillian 
Byrd is able to bring more to the part of Presley's mother, Gladys, than she is 
to Priscilla in a fleetingly brief scene. Similarly, one wishes Jake Schmidt 
were given more to do as Presley's father, Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Petrovich's inventive set design and Brenda Berry's lighting allow the 
action to glide smoothly between past and present and from venue to venue, 
capturing the chandeliered opulence of Presley's red-curtained estate, the 
drabness of a tiny hotel room, a brightly lit bar with a jukebox, a glittering 
performance stage. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the continuing fascination with Presley is that he, like Marilyn 
Monroe, was the American dream gone wrong. The scores of books and plays and 
movies that have come out about them have one question at the center: Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Are You Lonesome Tonight?" doesn't have the feel of the answer, but it does 
shed some light on the loneliness that can emerge in childhood and can, if 
unchecked, grow into a malignant tumor by adulthood. Ironically, if Elvis had 
been able to make peace between his older and younger selves as this play 
suggests, one wonders if he would have continued to destroy himself. 
</P>
<P>
 At 79 Horton Plaza, San Diego, Tuesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 7, 
Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. and one Saturday matinee Sept. 16, through Oct. 1.

GRIT AND GLITTER WILL SHARE THE BOARDS DURING GLOBE'S 1990 SEASON

Something old ("Uncle Vanya"), something new (by Neil Simon), something 
borrowed (Lee Blessing's "Cobb," first produced by the Yale Repertory Theatre) 
and something blue ("Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill," about singer Billie 
Holiday) are part of the Old Globe Theatre's six-play season for next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Jake's Women," the second world premiere of a Neil Simon play in two years at 
the Old Globe, and the West Coast premiere of "Cobb" should be the stars to 
watch as the 1990 season of glitter and grit unfolds. Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," 
directed by Old Globe artistic director Jack O'Brien, Jan. 11-Feb. 18, 
completes the offerings at the Globe's 581-seat main stage. 
</P>
<P>
The grit is in the three plays at the 225-seat Cassius Carter Centre Stage, 
which all feature playwrights found in the Old Globe Play Discovery and Latino 
Play Discovery programs: Mark Lee, whose play "Paradise" was found in the Play 
Discovery Program, will have the West Coast premiere of "Rebel Armies Deep into 
Chad," about two arrogant journalists in an African region torn with violence, 
March 3-April 15; Lanie Robertson, whose "Alfred Stieglitz Loves O'Keefe" went 
from a Play Discovery Program reading to a full production at the Cassius 
Carter last year, will return with "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill," April 
28-June 10; and Roberto M. Cossa, whose play "The Granny" was a workshop 
production in Teatro Meta's Latino Play Discovery Series, will have a full 
production of his black comedy about a family in depressed Argentina that 
starts plotting to get rid of granny because she 
</P>
<P>
eats too much, Jan. 6-Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
For the glitter: The Simon play, "Jake's Women," and the Blessing work, about 
the legendary baseball hitter Ty Cobb, offer two looks at plays that are likely 
candidates to make the leap from regional theater to Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Only last year, with Simon's "Rumors" at the Old Globe, the popular playwright 
opted for the first time to premiere a show in a regional theater production. 
"Rumors" moved directly to Broadway, where it is still running. 
</P>
<P>
"Cobb," which was first produced by the Yale Repertory Theatre and will be 
mounted with the same cast under the same director, Yale's artistic director 
Lloyd Richards, is the third collaboration in three years between the two 
nonprofit regional theaters. The last two shows were August Wilson's "Joe 
Turner's Come and Gone," which subsequently went to Broadway, and "The Piano 
Lesson," which is due on Broadway April 16. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Mordecai, managing director of the Yale Rep, sees the cooperation 
between the Globe and Yale as the wave of the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's replaced the old network of play development in the 1950s when there were 
no regional theaters and people would take a play through separate cities and 
try it out," said Mordecai. "It's financially unfeasible in the commercial 
theater now to spend time in the development of serious plays. I really believe 
in this process. I think that collaborations between theaters is a very good 
evolution." 
</P>
<P>
"Jake's Women," continues the semi-autobiographical tradition of the 
playwright's "Chapter 2" and the trilogy of "Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi 
Blues" and "Broadway Bound," with the story of a middle-aged writer and six of 
the most important women in his life -- his analyst, sister, daughter, wife, 
ex-wife and a friend. The show, which will run March 8-April 15 under the 
direction of Ron Link, was supposed to be Simon's first world premiere at the 
Old Globe last year. The show wasn't ready so he debuted with "Rumors." 
</P>
<P>
"We had our collective breaths held," said O'Brien, artistic director of the 
Old Globe, of the "Rumors" run. "Neil had never dealt with an organization like 
ours." Simon's decision to premiere "Jake's Women" at the Old Globe is 
indicative to O'Brien that the collaboration worked. And he is especially 
pleased at the most recent fruit of those labors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the greatest play he has ever written," O'Brien said of 
"Jake's Women." " 'Rumors' is a departure from the vein in which he has written 
for the last eight or nine years. He needed to clear his head and not think too 
much. This is very funny and intensely personal and one of the most remarkably 
brave theatrical departures I've ever seen him make. I am so proud we are doing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"Cobb," tentatively slated for May 3-June 10, marks an Old Globe debut for 
Blessing, who has done three shows in three years at the La Jolla Playhouse, 
including the internationally reknowned "A Walk in the Woods" and the currently 
running "Down the Road." 
</P>
<P>
"Uncle Vanya," a story of three men's love for a single woman, represents a 
long desired venture back to the classics for O'Brien, who, with the exception 
of "Antony and Cleopatra" two seasons ago, has been largely directing new works 
for the Globe. 
</P>
<P>
"The last couple of years I've done more new pieces than the resonating 
classics," said O'Brien. "When you have a theater like this you have a dream 
list. You usually do what the institution needs rather than what you want to 
do. I started here in 1982 and it's 1989 and I thought I should start doing 
some of those shows I always wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
The season begins in January rather than December this year, to avoid butting 
up against the plentiful array of December holiday show offerings, said 
O'Brien. Instead, the stage will take a different turn -- and a few somersaults 
-- when the Peking Acrobats take their tumbles in a Dec. 5-10 spot at the Old 
Globe.

Istvan Bacskai Lauro, leaning back in his crisp white cottons to survey the 
hills below him like a ruler taking inventory of his kingdom. "The secret is 
knowing how to manipulate it and who to bribe. . . . One must use connections 
and money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burying the Sickle 
</P>
<P>
Much blood has been shed in Hungary this century in the name of the 
proletariat. But most Hungarians today would much rather march within the ranks 
of the moneyed class, whose shiny sports cars, A-frame homes and satellite 
dishes dot the Rozsa Domb (Rose Hills), the Hungarian equivalent of Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout these hills ring the sounds of construction as workers wield their 
hammers to build three-story, half-million-dollar homes for those who have 
buried the sickle of communism forever. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary has always had an elite, of course. The Communist system even has a 
name for it -- the nomenklatura, whose power and privilege were passports to an 
easy life. But Hungary's wealthy have long been forced by the reigning ideology 
to enjoy their fortunes discreetly, behind locked doors. 
</P>
<P>
No longer. As Hungary moves steadily toward a market economy, those with money 
and Western-style business skills find themselves increasingly courted by the 
same government that threatened to jail them for "speculation" 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scathing Reviews 
</P>
<P>
The result is an emerging entrepreneurial class that pays little attention to 
socialism, except to dismiss it scathingly. 
</P>
<P>
"Socialism? That's against human nature," one businessman says. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone hated communism. They were just acting," says another. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Lauro, speak candidly about bribing people. Others pepper their 
conversations with discussions about burgeoning art collections and his-and-her 
Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
The Western concept of conspicuous consumption has taken firm root. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian yuppies zip down the grand leafy boulevard of Nepkoztarsasag Utca 
(People's Republic Street) in new BMWs. They drop bundles of forints -- 
Hungary's currency -- at chic, privately owned bistros where everything from 
the lobster to the avocados is flown in from the West. 
</P>
<P>
These are the most obvious signs that the gap between the rich and poor is 
widening in socialist Hungary. But in the side streets and alleys there are 
others: the growing numbers of homeless men and women rooting through the 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
In a country where the average Hungarian lives with her or his family in a 
three-room, high-rise, cinder-block apartment and earns $130 a month, there is 
growing resentment and envy toward those whom the economic reforms have helped 
make rich. 
</P>
<P>
"They hate my car," said Gabor Varszegi, staring gloomily at an ugly gash 
inflicted by vandals on his sleek, black Mercedes 560 SL. Varszegi, 43, founded 
a financial empire around one-hour photo-processing shops in a joint venture 
with Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, if you wore a pair of blue jeans and drove a Czech car, you 
were rich," recalled Varszegi, who got his first taste of wealth in the 1960s 
as the bass player for a successful Hungarian rock band called Gemini. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Varszegi took a $200,000 investment and opened a Fotex-Kodak shop in 
Budapest's Scala department store. The first year, he made a 500% profit, he 
says. Last year, he made $6 million with six shops. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he employs 105 people and has branched out into contact-lens 
manufacturing, picture-frame and animal-feed factories and a state-of-the-art 
eye clinic with 20 doctors. Launching a weekly newspaper and opening a Budapest 
diamond exchange are next. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very familiar with the rules in Hungary. I have very good connections," 
said Varszegi, sinking into a green velvet chair at the Ballantine's Club, a 
posh, private watering hole for wealthy businessmen in the city. But he 
admitted that most Hungarians aren't so lucky. Many feel betrayed, he says, by 
40 years of Communist rule that promised social equality but has delivered 
little social security. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the system. The people feel they have no chance, no opportunity," he 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Ottilia Solt, a Budapest sociologist who studies the poor, agreed that there is 
growing resentment and that it could lead to social unrest. 
</P>
<P>
"People are angry with those who are at the top, who are given advantages and 
privileges as never before under the slogan of capitalism," Solt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20% Live in Poverty 
</P>
<P>
She cited a study that found that one in five Hungarians lives below the 
poverty level. The state Department of Statistics said that in 1987, the last 
year for which figures are available, only 5% of Hungarians made more than 
10,000 forints (about $170) per month. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, officials in banking and the government tax and finance ministries 
estimate there are about 50,000 Hungarians, out of 10.6 million, who are 
millionaires in forint terms. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes talent and luck, and working 16 hours a day," said Lauro, the film 
director. "Then sooner or later, you're going to make it to the top. The 
problem is that everyone is in a greedy rush to be rich overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Lauro, 56, said he comes from middle-class family of clerks. He is known in 
artistic circles for helping to found the Bela Balazs Studio, Hungary's 
acclaimed experimental film center that nurtured directors such as Istvan 
Szabo. 
</P>
<P>
Kitty Lauro owns a tony fashion boutique that bears her name in Budapest's chic 
shopping district near the banks of the Danube. She is a child of prewar 
wealth: Her father used to own Hungary's largest shirt-making factory. 
</P>
<P>
Kitty started her career as a tour guide, then graduated to modeling. She 
married twice, once to an Austrian millionaire. Istvan went through two 
marriages of his own. They met in 1971 and have made money together ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Istvan helps manage the business, and Kitty designs all the fashions and 
supervises a small factory that makes the garments. They attribute their 
success to the marriage of business and artistic skills. 
</P>
<P>
But life hasn't always been filled with caviar and champagne. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1970, when Kitty opened her store, it was the first time the word boutique 
had ever been used in Hungary," her husband said. "Of course, it had to be 
taken down immediately because it wasn't a Hungarian word and it smacked of 
capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
But the Lauros persisted, under the benediction of Hungarian leader Janos 
Kadar's "goulash communism," which permitted small businesses to flourish so 
long as owners didn't flaunt their wealth too openly. In this way did many 
Hungarians quietly accumulate fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Others plied the realm of the black market or sidestepped the Hungarian tax 
laws, which can gobble up to 90% of profits, by under-reporting sales. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have a boutique, and I sell 600 pairs of jeans but only post 10 sales, I 
pay very little in taxes," one businessman explained. 
</P>
<P>
But Hungarian entrepreneurs illustrate the perils of succeeding too well with 
the apocryphal "cherry pit" or "apricot seed" story. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that about 15 years ago, a Hungarian pharmaceutical firm was looking 
for seeds, and a fruit preserves firm was discarding them. A businessman who 
saw an opportunity bought the waste seeds from one firm and sold them to the 
needy party. He was promptly jailed for profiteering. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarians use this tale to warn outsiders that despite the economic and 
political reforms in modern-day Hungary, businessmen still look over their 
shoulders, fearful of a crackdown and the return of the Soviet tanks whose 
arrival in 1956 signaled the end of an earlier thaw. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow, if some crazy man shoots down Mr. (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev, I have to 
close the company and leave the county," said Varszegi. He was voicing a common 
fear about the Soviet president, whose reform program in his own country has 
set a liberal tone and stretched the boundaries of what is permissible in East 
Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
Those who mistrust communism note an alarming trend: Party functionaries who 
formerly espoused puritanical values now lust after Armani suits and Gucci 
loafers. Their children are entering the moneyed elite, forging alliances of 
power with the capitalist entrepreneurs who were formerly ideological enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"Party members now have a son involved in a joint business venture with a 
foreign firm, a daughter with a boutique, and Daddy can still be the Communist 
factory boss. This is the new leadership of the country," Lauro said. 
</P>
<P>
Sociologist Solt, an editor of former samizdat, or underground publications, 
who was harassed by the police for many years, said the new wealth of party 
officials is an especially bitter pill to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't mind when a boutique owner gets rich, but there is resentment 
against party functionaries who didn't lose their possessions, their cars, 
their houses or their positions and are now at the top of the economy," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One positive aspect, however, is the decline of neighborhood watchdogs who once 
zealously monitored the living standards of others. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier, if you had a better car than your neighbor, someone would report it 
to the police or the local council," Lauro said. "You got used to the idea that 
you mustn't show you have money, and since you couldn't buy a factory or invest 
it, you didn't know what to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Many found a solution by building opulent palaces behind the nondescript and 
sheltering walls around their properties. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk into these people's homes, and they are filled with marble columns 
and gold-leaf inlays and chrome fixtures," marveled a Budapest journalist who 
writes about fashion and design. 
</P>
<P>
Since travel restrictions to the West have been eased this year, many take 
luxury vacations. 
</P>
<P>
"Travel agencies advertise half-a-million forint ($8,000) vacations in their 
shop windows, and they sell out within a half-hour," one Hungarian business 
writer said. 
</P>
<P>
The loser in this spending spree is the government, which is trying to 
stimulate its domestic economy but is suffering from the public's longstanding 
distrust against savings and investment. 
</P>
<P>
It's little wonder. Hungarians have seen their currency formally devalued twice 
in the past year. Some who recall 1948, when the Communists nationalized all 
industry, are wary of giving the country's leaders a second opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Varszegi, who lived in the United States for almost a decade, does sink money 
into his business. But he also invests in art. 
</P>
<P>
At Fotex headquarters, in the Buda Hills, Varszegi showed a visitor his 
Salvador Dalis, Marc Chagalls, a bronze sculpture by Wild West artist Frederick 
Remington and a winsome Art Deco statue by Erte that he picked up for $26,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I collect everything," he said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
Not all Hungarian millionaires cultivate such a high profile. Even Lauro, who 
is forthright about most things, admonished a visitor: "Please don't ask 
anything about finances." 
</P>
<P>
But he was more than happy to give a quick tour of his well-appointed home. 
</P>
<P>
On the walls of his study hangs a Russian icon overlaid with a heavy gold cross 
that might give a few museum directors acquisitive pangs. A sleek personal 
computer, on which the Lauros track their transactions, perches above a 
hand-carved wood desk. An antique tapestry of a Magyar astride a horse graces 
another wall. 
</P>
<P>
The house, located on the aptly named Szobadsag Hegy (Freedom Hill), brings 
home the point that while Hungary retains vestiges of socialism, its wealthy 
enjoy the fruits of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lauro: "When we bought this house 15 years ago, we had to pay an extra fee 
for the view. It's got the best view in all Budapest."

'STAR WARS' CUTS CONFIRMED BY WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The White House on Thursday stood by Vice President Dan Quayle's assessment 
that the "Star Wars" program has been scaled back from former President Ronald 
Reagan's ambitious concept, but it said that Quayle's description of the 
original plan was inflammatory. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we have different today is two inflammatory words," White House 
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. Quayle had characterized as "political jargon" 
Reagan's initial goal for his Strategic Defense Initiative, as "Star Wars" is 
formally known. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the White House has recognized for some time that the original 
Reagan plan of creating an "astrodome" anti-missile shield for the nation would 
have to be scaled down. 
</P>
<P>
But, when asked whether the White House had given up on the idea of a "total, 
space-based defense shield against all incoming nuclear missiles" -- the 
original "Star Wars" concept envisioned by Reagan -- Fitzwater said: "That 
still is the theoretical concept under which the SDI program operates. That's 
kind of the goal that you keep working forward to as you proceed with research 
and development." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's remarks, in an interview with The Times on Wednesday, reflected "the 
fact that we have been able to winnow the objectives of the program . . . to 
fit more definable kinds of objectives," the White House spokesman said. He 
described the scaling-back process as having been "under way for some time." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview at The Times' Washington Bureau, the vice president said: "We 
have redefined ("Star Wars" and) put it into missions, requirements, doctrine 
and strategy much differently than we did in the early 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who announced the program in March, 1983, as a shield-like defense to 
intercept ballistic missiles aimed at the United States, "talked about this 
impenetrable shield that was going to be completely leak-proof," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I believe that, in the semantics of, let's say, political jargon, that 
that was acceptable. But it clearly was stretching the capability of a 
strategic defense system." 
</P>
<P>
Other government officials vouched for Quayle's characterization. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nothing the vice president hasn't said before," said Mark Albrecht, 
executive director of the National Space Council, of which Quayle is chairman. 
"He's a strong supporter of SDI. He understands it, and he has it just right." 
</P>
<P>
Retired Gen. Daniel O. Graham, one of the originators of the SDI concept and 
now chairman of High Frontier, a group that lobbies on behalf of space defense, 
said that the uproar over Quayle's comments is "kind of annoying, to be 
perfectly frank about it." 
</P>
<P>
"Even Reagan said he wasn't talking about perfection" -- a leakproof 
anti-missile shield -- when he proposed the program, Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true that it was a piece of political jargon," Graham said. "But, as a 
matter of fact, Dan Quayle is the strongest supporter of SDI within this 
Administration. The notion that Danny Quayle has given up on this program is 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quayle's Remarks Praised 
</P>
<P>
Richard N. Perle, who as a senior Reagan Administration defense official tried 
to scale back public claims for the "Star Wars" program, hailed Quayle's 
remarks as "long overdue," adding that it should improve the prospects for 
congressional and public support of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It marks a real change in the sense that the goals he's talking about for SDI 
are both more realistic and more affordable," Perle said. "The arguments 
against the Strategic Defense Initiative have been based to an extraordinary 
degree on the notion of a perfect defense. This pulls the ground out from under 
those critics." 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney could not be reached for comment. But, during his 
confirmation hearings in March, he acknowledged that the "Star Wars" concept 
had been "oversold" by Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a speech two weeks ago, Cheney said that SDI was never intended to be 
an impenetrable shield against all nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
"When SDI was first proposed by President Reagan, some critics thought it was 
hopelessly idealistic," Cheney told a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention. But 
he said that even a partial shield would be militarily useful by complicating 
the job of Soviet war planners, who would not know how many or which of their 
missiles would reach their targets. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to pursue SDI because we think a successful SDI program would be 
immensely valuable," Cheney said. "It no longer is visionary to think that a 
successful strategic defense could render our fears about a preemptive first 
strike obsolete. That is why President Bush committed himself to deploying SDI 
when it proves feasible." 
</P>
<P>
"Star Wars" budget cuts have forced defense contractors to scale back their 
hopes in recent years, but defense industry and Pentagon officials said that 
the new focus on limited defenses will not mean the end of potentially vast 
business opportunities. Industry experts said that the focus on low-cost 
space-based interceptors is expected to mean big rewards for firms such as 
Martin Marietta Corp. and Rockwell International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Many at the Pentagon, which has stewarded the program since 1983, insist that 
Quayle's remarks do not mark a change in policy but rather a shift in emphasis 
toward defensive technologies that will be available for deployment soon. Six 
years and billions of dollars after Reagan's 1983 announcement, defense 
technologists are closing in on many of the engineering problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it as a change in basic objectives," said Kent G. Stansberry, a 
senior Defense Department official responsible for helping set department 
policy for "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
"There is simply a lot more focus on practical things" as the Defense 
Department nears decisions on deployment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, referring to the placement of the Quayle story in the most prominent 
spot on Thursday's front page of The Times, said: "The story has been played a 
little interestingly, but essentially the vice president has been, is, and will 
remain one of the main advocates of SDI." 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Bush agreed with Quayle's assessment of Reagan's original 
program as "political jargon," Fitzwater said: 
</P>
<P>
"I read the quote specifically, and I urge all of you to read it, too, not the 
way it was reported in the lead of the story, but in its entirety. The vice 
president did use those words to reflect some of the rhetoric that was attached 
to the program. But he believes in the goals and objectives of the program . . 
. . President Bush did and still does, and there is no difference between them. 
Nor is there any turning away from the original objectives as enunciated in the 
Reagan Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater argued that the missile defense program has been evolving over 
several years and that the vice president's comments on the shift to the 
so-called "Brilliant Pebbles" concept were "simply reflecting the status of the 
program today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swarms of Interceptors 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, when Bush asked Congress for about $4.7 billion for the "Star 
Wars" program for the 1990 fiscal year, Cheney said that a key component would 
be development of a "Brilliant Pebbles" weapon. The proposed weapon would 
consist of swarms of small space-based interceptors designed to knock out 
ballistic missiles headed toward the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And, during the political campaign last September, Quayle said in an interview 
with The Times that a "better comprehension of SDI" was needed in the future 
than had existed during the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
He said SDI advocates pushed the total shield description as a way "to begin to 
capture the imagination" of the public. "That's nice, but it might be after my 
lifetime," he said. "Now, we're back to a practical point of view."

MOSCOW LAUNCHES LEBANON PEACE BID; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIETS, ARAB LEAGUE SEEK ACCORD IN TIME FOR SHEVARDNADZE-BAKER TALKS 
</P>

<P>
In a last-ditch effort to end the escalating Lebanese crisis, the Soviet Union 
and the Arab League are working behind the scenes to win support from Christian 
and Muslim warlords for a revived seven-point peace plan, U.S. officials and 
Arab diplomatic sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to obtain a general agreement before a Sept. 20 meeting between 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze at which Lebanon's 14-year civil war will be a topic high on the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations represent a potentially promising development for a 
breakthrough in the Lebanon impasse. But Bush Administration officials 
cautioned that the efforts could fall through, as have dozens of previous peace 
initiatives since the war erupted in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Gives Blessing 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has given the plan its blessing, according to a State 
Department source. He noted, however, that several sticking points prevent the 
United States from getting "prematurely excited" about the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Arab sources said that Moscow played the pivotal role in breaking a deadlock 
that had forced a special Arab League committee to abandon its fledgling peace 
initiative just three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point was the Soviet Union's ability to win Syria's tentative 
acceptance of the Arab League's seven-point plan, which calls for a phased 
withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops based in Lebanon since 1976. Moscow is 
Syria's main arms supplier. 
</P>
<P>
"Many developments have taken place over the last fews days which allow us to 
be a little more optimistic than at any time in the last year," said Clovis 
Maksoud, the Arab League's representative to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"International efforts, specifically the Soviet initiative, have provided a 
conducive stimulant for all parties in Lebanon to abandon their intransigence," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maksoud also gave partial credit to increased U.S.-Soviet cooperation on 
defusing regional conflicts. "This initiative is not in confrontation or 
competition with the United States but is a product of the new spirit of 
cooperation between the two superpowers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. and Arab sources, Moscow hopes that a major Soviet role in 
bringing an end to the crisis in Lebanon will open the way for greater Soviet 
involvement in negotiations to end the Arab-Israeli dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the U.S. withdrawal of the last 30 American diplomats in Beirut may 
contribute to the renewed peace effort by making right-wing Christians 
recognize their limited diplomatic options. U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy and 
29 embassy staff members were evacuated Wednesday morning in response to 
threats by militant Christians who had laid siege to the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
An Arab diplomatic source called the withdrawal "a blessing in disguise." He 
said that Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian commander of the Lebanese army 
and acting premier, "may now be jolted into some sense. He will have to be more 
responsive" to peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
A major obstacle to past peace efforts has been Maronite Christian 
intransigence over reforms designed to bring about a balance of power between 
the majority Muslim community and the minority Christians, who have dominated 
Lebanon's political system since the nation's independence from France more 
than four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. George Saadeh, a Christian member of Parliament and president of the 
right-wing Falangist Party, has backed the Arab League committee's peace plan, 
according to Arab sources. But Aoun's cooperation is considered essential to 
win Christian participation. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that Aoun could reject the peace plan is considered by U.S. 
officials to be the biggest potential peril facing the initiative. France may 
play a key role in persuading the Christians to accept the Arab League plan, 
but Paris reportedly was furious about the U.S. Embassy evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
One official said the withdrawal "sent the wrong signal to the Syrians, in 
effect telling them to take over Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
French officials were sufficiently angry about the move that this official 
decided to air a French grievance against Washington. He said that Paris had 
provided significant information about "complicity of the Syrian army in drug 
trafficking in Lebanon through the continent" but that the information was 
ignored -- even though the United States was preparing to launch an all-out war 
on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Left-wing Muslim militias have been persuaded by the Soviet Union, Syria and 
Saudi Arabia to accept the Arab League plan, according to Arab diplomats. Syria 
also pledged to bring along the fringe Shiite Muslim extremist movements, 
although U.S. officials believe that Shiite concurrence will depend on Iran's 
support for the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Arab envoys said Moscow applied intense diplomatic pressure on Syrian President 
Hafez Assad while offering unspecified incentives to support the peace plan. 
Moroccan King Hassan II and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid, two members of 
the special Arab League peace committee, met with Assad for key talks in 
Tripoli during the 20th anniversary celebrations of Libya's revolution last 
week. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd -- the other member of the committee -- also has 
been a major influence in persuading the Damascus government. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cautious optimism among Arab officials, the Bush Administration was 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever it comes to peace efforts in Lebanon, one is guarded in one's 
optimism," said a senior Administration source. "But we have made clear that 
we'll support Arab League efforts, and this is no exception. If we can be 
helpful, we will." 
</P>
<P>
The official also noted: "The Soviets are in a good position to be helpful if 
they want. They have influence in Baghdad (Iraq) and Damascus, with the PLO and 
Tehran (Iran)," a reference to the major players that have a significant 
presence or influence in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"They also have an incentive -- to get into the broader game," he said. "But 
first they have to prove their bona fides." 
</P>
<P>
Senior State Department official Dennis Ross, who is one of Baker's closest 
aides, is in Europe for talks with Gennady Tarasov, a leading Soviet official 
on the Middle East. The State Department confirmed that the talks were 
initiated by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year civil war has escalated since March into a fight to the finish 
pitting Maronite Christians in the army and private militias against Muslim 
gunmen and their Syrian supporters. More than 800 people have been killed and 
2,400 injured in a conflict that has seen 80% of the population flee the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
The first step of the seven-point peace plan would be a cease-fire, followed by 
a partial Syrian withdrawal to Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, according to 
sources close to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Parliament members then would meet in Saudi Arabia to work out 
political reforms. A rough draft worked out by the three members of the Arab 
League committee -- Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Morocco -- calls for an even 
split in parliamentary representation between Christians and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
The presidency would remain in the hands of the Maronite Christians. But the 
powers of the presidency would be significantly diminished, while that of the 
premiership, held by a Sunni Muslim, would be increased. The Shiites would 
retain the position of Parliament Speaker, but a new job may be created for a 
Shiite vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the Lebanese government, including the civil service, the current 
sectarian division of jobs on a 6-to-5 ratio -- with Christians having the edge 
over Muslims in jobs ranging from the judiciary to postal officials -- would be 
phased out over a transition period in favor of selection by merit. 
</P>
<P>
The plan then calls for Parliament to reconvene in Beirut to elect a new 
president, a process stalled for more than a year because of Parliament's 
inability to meet at its building on the Green Line, which divides the capital. 
That failure led outgoing President Amin Gemayel to appoint Aoun as acting 
premier. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult step will be the final point, which calls for the withdrawal 
of all Syrian and Israeli troops from Lebanon. Since its 1985 pullback after a 
three-year occupation of Lebanon, Israel has maintained a small security 
enclave in southern Lebanon.

NASA SEEKS CLUES TO LIFE IN THE EARTH'S BACK YARD

Each July and August, blue ice lakes form on the surface of glaciers near the 
U.S. research station at Sondre Stromfjord in southern Greenland. Belying the 
pristine Greenland air and the clean-swept beauty of the glaciers, the bottoms 
of the lakes are covered with black organic goo. 
</P>
<P>
The tar is not the residue of an oil spill, nor is it any other detritus of 
civilization. It is comet dust, a melange of rock and organic materials formed 
between the planets, and between stars, and dating back perhaps to the 
formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The dust falls to Earth continually -- and on other planets and moons as well 
-- becoming buried in the snow and ice. In the arctic regions, it is 
concentrated by the summer melt and then settles on lake bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
Earth's organic chemicals -- the stuff of life -- represent only a fraction of 
the total found throughout the solar system. In fact, "the universe is awash in 
organic chemicals" like those from which life evolved on Earth, said astronomer 
Dale Cruikshank of NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the apparent ease with which life was created on Earth, some 
researchers believe life could have arisen elsewhere in the solar system as 
well: on the surface of Mars, when water flowed freely there, or in the frozen 
oceans of Europa, a moon of Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the launch of the Magellan probe to Venus in May and next month's 
launch of Galileo to Jupiter, NASA has begun a new series of exploratory 
missions to Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, its satellite Titan and at least two 
comets. In addition to evidence about the origin of the solar system, they hope 
to discover primitive forms of life that are no longer present on Earth itself, 
as well as other evidence that would illuminate the origin of life. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, researchers hope that information gained from those missions 
will shed light on how primitive organic molecules were organized into the more 
complex forms that are now characteristic of life. 
</P>
<P>
"The clues to life's origin . . . are going to be found elsewhere in the solar 
system," said Lynn Griffiths, head of NASA's exobiology program, which studies 
life off the Earth. "Exobiology has matured quite a bit in the last 20 years 
and is now in its active young adulthood," added cosmologist Harold P. Klein of 
the University of Santa Clara. "We have unlimited challenges. Unfortunately, at 
the present we have only limited opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers gathered recently in Sunnyvale for a NASA-sponsored conference to 
discuss the best places to look for life off the Earth. They concluded that a 
number of tempting targets exist within the solar system but that undoubtedly 
the chances of finding life are rather small. Many would be happy to find 
fossils of life that had once existed elsewhere, but others argue that more 
clear-cut evidence -- including living organisms -- is necessary to convince 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Exobiologists once had high hopes for Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, and 
were crushed when the Mariner probes produced no evidence of life. But they 
have been reassessing what they know about the Red Planet and now think that 
perhaps the probe simply wasn't looking in the right place. "Mars is still the 
best candidate for life in the solar system," said astrophysicist Christopher 
McKay of the Ames lab. 
</P>
<P>
The chief factor militating against life existing on Mars, which is about half 
the size of Earth, is the small amount of water that exists there, either 
frozen at the poles in winter or vaporized in summer. The fact that water is 
not present in liquid form is "a serious problem for contemplating life on 
Mars," McKay said, "but it hasn't always been that way." 
</P>
<P>
Photographs of Mars show large areas, such as Valles Marinaris and Playa Lake, 
that look as though they were shaped by water. Valles Marinaris, for example, 
has a delicate surface tracery of small channels that could have been formed by 
the slow flow of water on the surface, "perhaps rain finding a collection 
area," McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
This and other evidence suggest that during the period from 4.5 billion to 3.5 
billion years ago Mars had a relatively thick atmosphere, much larger 
quantities of water and a surface temperature above freezing. "If life did 
exist then, there could be a record," said Glenn Carle, chief of NASA's Solar 
System Exploration Branch. 
</P>
<P>
"What we really need to know is: If life didn't evolve there, why not?" McKay 
said. If life didn't evolve on Mars, "there is something wrong with our 
understanding of Mars or our paradigm for the evolution of life on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missions to Mars 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union and the United States are discussing manned missions to the 
Red Planet. McKay and others are urging that any landings be made in the polar 
regions near the ice caps or in regions where there is evidence of past water 
flow because that is where evidence of life is most likely to occur. 
</P>
<P>
A more remote possibility for life is Venus, the second planet from the sun. 
The planet, which is about the size of Earth, has an average surface 
temperature of about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, an atmosphere that is 95 times as 
dense as Earth's and virtually no water. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of extant life can be ruled out by these data," astrophysicist Larry 
Colin of San Jose State said. 
</P>
<P>
But, like Mars, Venus could have been more hospitable to life early in its 
history when the sun was not putting out as much radiation as it does now. One 
key piece of evidence favoring a clement early Venus are mass spectrometer 
measurements made by the Pioneer Venus spacecraft of the ratio of deuterium to 
hydrogen in the planet's atmosphere. Deuterium is a rare heavy isotope of 
hydrogen. 
</P>
<P>
The deuterium/hydrogen ratio on Venus is about 100 times as great as Earth's. 
Because water containing deuterium is heavier than normal water and thus 
evaporates more slowly, this ratio indicates that Venus probably had 
"significant amounts of water," Colin said. As the planet warmed up, that water 
eventually rose into the upper atmosphere, where it was broken apart by 
sunlight, leaving behind the heavier deuterium as much of the lighter hydrogen 
escaped into space. 
</P>
<P>
Venus could have had oceans during this period, and life could have gotten 
started, only to die out as the planet heated up, astrophysicist James Kasting 
of Ames said. Traces of life could still remain, he said. It may be very 
difficult to locate such evidence, however, because of Venus' hostile 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Venus' Past 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope to learn much more about Venus' past from the Magellan probe, 
which is scheduled to reach the "Veiled Planet" Aug. 10, 1990. The probe will 
use sophisticated radar imaging to map at least 80% of the planet's surface, a 
process that is expected to shed light on its geological history and the origin 
of the "runaway greenhouse effect" that caused its high surface temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most tantalizing object in the solar system is Europa, a Jovian 
moon slightly larger than Earth's moon. Voyager 2 pictures show that its 
surface is bright, smooth and highly fractured "like sea ice," astronomer Steve 
Squyres of Cornell University said. 
</P>
<P>
The whole surface of Europa has only about five craters, even though it has 
presumably been subject to the same intense bombardment that has left the 
Earth's moon covered with craters. Researchers thus believe that Europa has 
continuing geological activity that obliterates the craters. 
</P>
<P>
About 7% of the mass of Europa is water, he said, and the most likely 
explanation for the surface features is that the moon's surface is covered by 
an ocean of liquid water topped with a thick layer of ice. The water is 
presumably kept liquid by tidal heating, a continual compression and relaxation 
of the moon caused by Jupiter's massive gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, according to biochemist John Oro of the University of Houston, 
"there is more organic material on Europa than in the terrestrial biosphere," 
as well as other elements, like phosphorus, that are crucial to life. "And if 
there is liquid water, then Europa has potential hot spots" similar to thermal 
vents in the Earth's oceans. 
</P>
<P>
His conclusion: "Could terrestrial life grow there? My answer is yes. We 
definitely need a close flyby and landing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Plans for Mission 
</P>
<P>
No such missions are planned at the moment, however, largely because of the 
difficulty of landing amid Jupiter's massive gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility, less likely but more accessible, is Titan, the largest 
moon of Saturn, said Thomas Scattergood of the State University of New York at 
Stony Brook. Titan, which is slightly larger than the Earth's moon, looks like 
"a featureless billiard ball" because its extensive atmosphere hides its 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
Although researchers have never seen the surface of Titan, Scattergood 
speculated that it is an ethane ocean containing both water-ice and frozen 
carbon dioxide. Large numbers of organic compounds could be formed from these 
raw materials through the action of sunlight, lightning and energetic particles 
trapped by Saturn's magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Titan can accommodate life will depend on how much water is 
present, he said. But "it looks like there is interesting organic chemistry 
taking place there even today," NASA's Carle added. 
</P>
<P>
Exobiologists are also interested in studying asteroids and comets, not because 
they think life might exist there but because these celestial bodies contain 
large amounts of organic chemicals and are presumably the source of most of the 
carbon-containing compounds now on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Asteroids, which early astronomers called the "vermin of the skies" because of 
their misleading motion, come in two categories, black and lighter, NASA's 
Cruikshank said. The black material, he said, is very much like kerogen, the 
complex organic material found in oil shale. The lighter material is made up of 
less complex organic substances. 
</P>
<P>
The asteroids and meteorites, added geochemist John Kerridge of UCLA, "are the 
only materials we have that date from the beginnings of the solar system. . . . 
Studies of carbon-containing meteorites that have fallen to Earth, called 
carbonaceous chondrites, have shown the presence of more than 400 different 
compounds, including most of the chemicals that are involved in life processes. 
</P>
<P>
Studies of such meteorites allow researchers to determine what kinds of 
chemicals were present on Earth before life arose, and may lead to new insights 
into the events that sparked life's formation. Researchers are thus eager to 
have more samples. Kerridge added: "We pray for more carbonaceous chondrite 
falls." 
</P>
<P>
Exobiologists may be able to get more information about life's origin without 
waiting around for more meteorites, as NASA begins sending more probes out into 
the solar system after an 11-year hiatus. "The queen is ready to give us more 
ships," Carle said. 
</P>
<P>
The Magellan mission that will perform radar mapping of Venus was launched from 
the space shuttle Atlantis in May, and the Galileo spacecraft to Jupiter is 
scheduled to be launched Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
NASA has also tentatively approved two other deep-space missions, Titan-Cassini 
and the Comet Rendezvous and Asteroid Flyby (CRAF). Both spacecraft, designed 
at JPL, would use versions of the successful Mariner Mark II spacecraft that 
would be outfitted with new instrumentation. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan-Cassini probe, named after the 17th-Century French- 
</P>
<P>
Italian astronomer who discovered several of Saturn's moons, would be launched 
from an expendable rocket in April, 1996. The following March, it would have a 
close flyby of asteroid Maja. It would swing by Jupiter in February, 2000, for 
a gravitational boost and reach Saturn in October, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
The orbiter will perform radar mapping of both Saturn and Titan, identifying 
objects as small as 200 yards in diameter. It will occasionally fly through the 
upper reaches of Titan's atmosphere and sample it, and will also send a probe 
to the moon's surface. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help on Financing 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the European Space Agency agreed to build the Titan probe and 
help finance the mission. NASA has not yet received funding from Congress for 
the $550-million mission but is seeking $40 million for the next fiscal year to 
begin construction of the craft. 
</P>
<P>
The CRAF mission, which is scheduled for launch in August, 1995, would 
intercept comet Kopff on Aug. 14, 2000, Marcia M. Neugebauer of JPL said. 
Unlike the flights to Halley's comet, which flew past it at high speed, CRAF 
will rendezvous with Kopff 850 days before its nearest approach to the sun and 
accompany it through its orbit, measuring its output of gases and dust. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tests on Comet 
</P>
<P>
After it has collected data for a year, CRAF will launch a 4.5-foot-long, golf 
tee-shaped penetrator that will sink at least 1 1/2 feet into the comet, 
measuring its strength, density, temperature and composition. 
</P>
<P>
On its way to the comet, CRAF will fly by an asteroid named Hamburga. "Perhaps 
we can get McDonald's to sponsor the mission," Neugebauer said. The craft will 
survey the asteroid's size, shape and rotation and gather information about its 
chemical composition. 
</P>
<P>
The CRAF mission has not yet been approved by NASA. Its cost would be about the 
same as Titan-Cassini.

BACKERS OF PROP. 103 FILE SUIT ON GILLESPIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insurance reform activists and allies filed suit in Sacramento Superior Court 
on Thursday, charging state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie with 
ignoring basic provisions of Proposition 103 and demanding that she take 
immediate steps to implement the voter-approved measure. 
</P>
<P>
Voter Revolt, headed by Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield, was joined in 
the suit by the Proposition 103 Intervention Team, the Center for Public 
Interest Law of the University of San Diego and the Los Angeles Chapter of the 
NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately we have been forced to take legal action because the insurance 
commissioner has repeatedly proven she is more interested in protecting 
insurance company profits than implementing the will of the people," said a 
written statement by Conway Collis, chairman of the Proposition 103 
Intervention Team. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the suit was filed the day after Gillespie announced a significant 
concession to critics by promising to set hearings this year on the rates 
charged by four major California insurance companies. Gillespie had previously 
drawn heated criticism for putting three of the firms -- State Farm Mutual, the 
Farmers group and the Automobile Club of Southern California -- on an 
unscheduled "slow track" to regulation that could have taken a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a recess of a hearing in Los Angeles into rates 
charged by the Allstate Insurance Co., Gillespie called the suit "spurious" and 
accused her critics of shirking the work of the hearing. "These people are 
basically opting out of the process while the rest of us are doing the work," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Collis replied that his organization was represented at the hearing while he 
was announcing the suit to the news media and that he and Rosenfield will 
continue to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
The suit demands that Gillespie hold immediate hearings for more than 200 
insurance companies that she had placed on the so-called "slow track" to 
regulation -- a concession that Gillespie essentially had made the day before 
at the same time she promised hearings into four major firms. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also demands that Gillespie: 
</P>
<P>
* Schedule hearings for about 180 other firms that she has exempted from 
rollbacks called for in the proposition passed by voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
* Adopt regulations to set automobile insurance rates for individuals that do 
not include geographical areas as criteria, a practice critics say has resulted 
in higher rates for urban areas and even higher rates for residents of 
inner-city areas such as South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
* Establish a standard to judge acceptable profit margins for companies 
undergoing hearings into rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie maintained that the landmark Allstate hearing which began Wednesday 
and was continued indefinitely Thursday, will provide a profitability standard 
and other criteria by which other insurance firms can be judged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First of 17 Firms 
</P>
<P>
Allstate is only the first of about 17 firms that Gillespie said will receive 
individual hearings on their rates before the end of the year. She also 
promises to hold a mass hearing this year for 257 smaller firms. 
</P>
<P>
But, judging by the progress of the Allstate hearing, some observers are 
doubtful that such tasks can be accomplished this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Allstate hearing was scheduled to last only two days, but so far only one 
witness has been heard -- an economist called by the company to defend its 
rates -- and an official of the firm said 13 other witnesses may be called to 
testify when the hearing resumes. 
</P>
<P>
The Allstate hearing marks the first time an insurance company in California 
has been required to justify its rates, and the proceedings frequently have 
moved slowly through uncharted areas such as the question of what constitutes a 
fair return on investment. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 mandated that insurance companies roll back their rates 20% 
from 1987 levels, but the state Supreme Court subsequently ruled that the firms 
have a right to fair profits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sets 'Benchmark' 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Gillespie and the state Department of Insurance later announced 
that data indicates that insurance companies in California have been earning a 
return on equity of 11.2% annually over the last 15 years. That number was set 
as a "benchmark" -- but not necessarily a floor or ceiling -- by which rates 
are to be judged at the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Using the 11.2% figure last month, Gillespie tentatively ordered Allstate to 
roll back its premiums by 6%, an overall reduction of $85.7 million statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Allstate is seeking approval of its present rate of return, set last year, 
which the company says is 13%. 
</P>
<P>
But consumer advocates, joined by the state attorney general's office, maintain 
that Allstate makes far more than 13% on equity and that the Department of 
Insurance's methods of analyzing such companies finances are inadequate to 
determine real profits.

U.S. APPEALS COURT RULING COULD ALTER STATE'S FOSTER CARE PAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a decision with potential ramifications for California, the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that Oregon's denial of foster care funding to 
children who live with close relatives is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Three foster children sued the state of Oregon, asserting that state 
regulations were illegal and unfair because they granted less financial aid to 
relatives who act as foster parents than to other foster parents, thus 
discouraging relatives from taking on this role. 
</P>
<P>
The children "have a constitutionally protected . . . interest in being placed 
with relatives," said the unanimous decision, written by Judges Dorothy W. 
Nelson, Betty B. Fletcher and Procter Hug Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The judges also said that "the state must assist children in its custody to 
exercise their constitutional right to live with fit members of their family." 
</P>
<P>
California has regulations that mirror those of Oregon and public interest 
lawyers said they might bring a federal court suit seeking to overturn the 
state's rules in light of the 9th Circuit decision. 
</P>
<P>
The decision cited previous cases which have held that the right to associate 
with family members is protected by the 14th Amendment's due process clause. 
</P>
<P>
The decision said that Oregon had illegally burdened the constitutional right 
to associate with family members when it adopted policies that prevented family 
members from living together. 
</P>
<P>
"No right is more sacred, and this right can be abrogated only to protect other 
very important interests," the judges said. 
</P>
<P>
The judges added that "the constitutionally protected 'family' extends beyond 
the nuclear family" of mother, father and child. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wonderful decision," said Pamela Mohr of Public Coun sel, the public 
interest arm of the Los Angeles and Beverly Hills Bar Assns. She said the 
decision ultimately could pave the way for thousands of children in Los Angeles 
to live with relatives who currently cannot afford to pay their expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County has 35,000 children under court supervision, more than any 
other county in the nation, Mohr said. 
</P>
<P>
The county needed at least 3,000 more foster homes in 1986 and the number has 
increased since then because a growing number of children must be separated 
from drug-addicted parents, according to Terry Carbaugh, an aide with 
Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equal Payments 
</P>
<P>
Areias authored legislation requiring relatives to be paid the same amount as 
non-relatives taking in foster children. The bill has passed the Legislature 
twice, but was vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian. This year, the legislation did 
not clear the Assembly Ways and Means Committee because another veto was 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the payout differences are significant. For instance, a 
non-relative with foster children ages 9, 12 and 15 receives $1,130 a month in 
California; a relative with foster children those ages receives $663 a month -- 
a difference of $467 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Paying relatives who act as foster parents the same as strangers who take in 
children would cost California about $72 million, state officials have 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
The case stemmed from the problems of three Oregon foster children -- Sheri 
Lipscomb, Autumn Scalf and William Scalf. The suit was filed by Portland civil 
rights lawyers Emily Simon and Mark Kramer as a class action on behalf of the 
three and all others in the same circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Lipscomb was a multihandicapped child of 15 when the suit was filed in 
February, 1987. Simon said Lipscomb had been in a severe car accident when she 
was 21 months old, had cerebral palsy and was permanently confined to a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
She lived with her parents until Dec. 11, 1985. On that day she was taken from 
her drug-addicted parents and put in a Portland children's shelter. Soon 
thereafter, she was made a ward of the court, which placed her with her aunt 
and uncle, Carolyn and Robert DeFehr. The DeFehrs feared that they would have 
to give up custody of Lipscomb because they could not afford to pay her high 
medical bills and joined the suit in hope of changing the Oregon system, Simon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Autumn Scalf was 12 and her brother William was 10 when they taken from their 
parents in October, 1985, after police in a Portland suburb found them 
unattended when they responded to a trash fire in the Scalf yard. Autumn and 
William also were made wards of the court and a local judge decided that 
placing them with their aunt and uncle, Gloria and Ron Self, was their best 
option. Seven months later, however, the Selfs gave up the children because 
they could not afford to keep them. 
</P>
<P>
Simon said the children were "caught in a Catch-22 situation. The state decided 
it was in their best interest to be placed with their relatives but the state 
also decided" that it would not pay the relatives as much to care for them as 
strangers would get. Oregon asserted that it had no constitutional obligation 
to fund the children's exercise of their constitutional right. The U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeal flatly rejected this contention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Obligations 
</P>
<P>
"By removing children from their parents' custody, making them wards of the 
state, and placing them in foster care programs, the state of Oregon 
established a special relationship with these children and thus assumed special 
constitutional obligations toward them. The state's obligation includes a duty 
to assist the children to exercise their constitutional right," the court 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's decision flies squarely in the face of a 1986 California appeals 
court decision. That decision held that the California system did not violate 
the equal protection clause of the California Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
While the federal decision does not overturn the California ruling, it is an 
invitation to interested parties to file a new suit in federal court 
challenging the California rules, according to Alice Brussiere, an attorney 
with the National Center for Youth Law in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
She called Thursday's decision "very significant. The California Department of 
Social Services will have to look at its policy. It looks like it's 
unconstitutional because it does what the Oregon policy did." 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Norris, a spokesman for the department, said she could not make any 
immediate comment because department attorneys had not seen the decision. But 
she said that when Deukmejian vetoed Areias' bill in September, 1987, 
department officials estimated that it would cost California $72 million to 
provide equal benefits to relatives taking in foster children.

Two masked men trying to hold up an armored car opened fire inside Bank of 
America's world headquarters Thursday, killing one guard and wounding a second 
guard and a bystander before fleeing on bicycles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Brink's guards had just dropped off $5,500 in cash at the bank about 10 
a.m. when they were confronted by the gunmen, whose faces were concealed by ski 
masks, in the concourse between Bank of America's world headquarters and its 
Montgomery Street branch, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen opened fire, hitting the two guards and a bystander who ran to help. 
The gunmen then grabbed a pouch and envelopes, homicide Inspector Whitey 
Guinther said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the guards were carrying travelers' checks, securities and bonds, 
some of which might be convertible to cash, but had no money on them. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Officer Dave Ambrose said the two gunmen escaped on bicycles 
resembling mountain bikes along the narrow streets and sidewalks of the city's 
bustling financial district. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen were described as white males with muscular builds, wearing blue 
jackets and blue jeans. One gunman was at least 6 feet, 2 inches tall, weighing 
about 200 pounds, in his early 30s. The second gunman was smaller, in his 20s, 
witnesses said.

IOWA SAILOR SEEN AS LONELY, TROUBLED; 
</P>
<P>
4-MONTH NAVY INQUIRY FINDS HARTWIG CAPABLE OF SUICIDE 
</P>

<P>
Gunner's Mate Clayton M. Hartwig, who almost certainly caused the calamitous 
April 19 explosion aboard the battleship Iowa, was a lonely, suicidal young 
sailor consumed by destructive fantasies, Navy officials have concluded after a 
four-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Hartwig was "emotionally capable of committing suicide, probably with the 
intent of killing others also," Vice Adm. J. S. Donnell III said after 
reviewing the exhaustive Navy and FBI inquiry into the explosion that killed 
47. 
</P>
<P>
An FBI personality profile went further, concluding that "Clayton Hartwig died 
as a result of his own actions, staging his death in such a fashion that he 
hoped it would appear to be an accident." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outwardly Normal 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's 1,100-page investigation report offers a riveting, disturbing and in 
some cases, contradictory, picture of a handsome, outwardly normal sailor whom 
the FBI characterized as a "troubled young man" who was "emotionally 
devastated" by the real and perceived rejections of those he befriended and 
loved. 
</P>
<P>
Hartwig, it was learned during the four-month inquiry, had tried to kill 
himself while in high school, considered himself an expert in explosives and 
detonators, kept a scrapbook on ship disasters and owned a handbook that 
offered explicit prescriptions for exacting violent revenge on one's enemies. 
He carried a gun in his car and his room at home was filled with military 
knives and books on war. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators reconstructed the disaster through physical evidence, interviews 
with survivors and a painstaking review of Hartwig's letters, belongings and 
comments to fellow sailors, friends and family. They concluded that the blast 
was the result of an "intentional, wrongful act" that could only have been 
committed by one person -- the 24-year-old Hartwig. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the explosion, Hartwig had been rebuffed by a fellow sailor with 
whom he tried to initiate a "close relationship," investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discussed Suicide 
</P>
<P>
Naval investigators found that Hartwig had discussed suicide in the weeks 
before the catastrophe, noting that his preferred way to die was in an 
explosion. On one visit home, he told a friend that "if something were to 
happen to the gun powder (in a 16-inch gun turret), the explosion would be 
quick and there would be no one left to tell the story." 
</P>
<P>
But while officials pointed an accusing finger at Hartwig, the Navy also found 
numerous failures of training, discipline, gunnery procedures and maintenance 
aboard the Iowa. The report recommended possible administrative punishment for 
several key officers, including the ship's skipper, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, and 
its executive officer, Cmdr. John P. Morse. 
</P>
<P>
But while one reviewer of the report cited "the number and egregiousness" of 
the ship's shortcomings, the investigators concluded that none of them caused 
the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
After being briefed by Navy officials on the findings of the investigation, 
Hartwig's family called a press conference in Cleveland to assail the report. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother . . . was not a depressed, despondent, suicidal murderer," 
Hartwig's sister, Kathleen M. Kubicina said. "They have no physical evidence, 
and they used the word 'probably' in the report. After months of investigation, 
and after spending $5 million, they are going to tell the American public 
'probably?' " 
</P>
<P>
The family's lawyer, Kreig Brusnahan, said that the Navy began its 
investigation by trying to look for a scapegoat to avoid admitting 
incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy is trying to dupe the American public," he said. "Why didn't he 
(Clayton) slit his wrists? Why didn't he jump off the ship? Why would he take 
46 of his closest friends with him?" 
</P>
<P>
Some shipmates and friends drew a different portrait. One Iowa crew member who 
befriended Hartwig in the two weeks before the fatal blast said that Hartwig 
was fascinated by death and often talked of how he would prefer to die. 
</P>
<P>
"We both agreed that explosion would be the best way to die because it was 
quick and painless," the sailor told agents of the Naval Investigative Service. 
</P>
<P>
Hartwig also confided in this sailor, four days before the fatal blast, that he 
had attempted suicide and that he was still considering it. "He told me he was 
having problems, but wouldn't exactly state what his problems were," the sailor 
told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The two stayed up well past midnight talking two or three nights before April 
19. On several occasions, Hartwig discussed explosives and how primers can set 
off the bags of powder used to fire the 16-inch guns. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he wanted to die in the line of duty and be buried in Arlington 
Cemetery, so he'd be remembered," the sailor recalled. 
</P>
<P>
A girl Hartwig met in 1987 and who corresponded briefly with him described him 
as "very shy, very self-conscious and lonely." She said that while he was 
confident in his ability to do his job aboard ship, he had a hard time making 
friends and had "very little self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
Another civilian friend characterized Hartwig as a "quiet and self-defeating 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
His fascination with war and weapons began in Hartwig's childhood, according to 
testimony from family and friends. He would closet himself for hours in his 
attic bedroom, reading military books and watching war movies. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy, investigators learned, Hartwig had blown up tree stumps with homemade 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
When NIS agents searched his room at his parents' home in Cleveland, they found 
photographs of Hartwig in a Navy commander's uniform and wearing a special 
warfare insignia, neither of which he was authorized to wear. 
</P>
<P>
Hartwig subscribed to Soldier of Fortune magazine and signed up as an associate 
member of an organization of veterans of a special forces unit in Vietnam. He 
expressed regret that he had not served in Vietnam because he missed the 
opportunity to serve and kill in combat. 
</P>
<P>
He told some of his fellow sailors that he wanted to join the Navy's elite Seal 
frogman team but couldn't because he did not know how to swim. 
</P>
<P>
Navy investigators spoke with 11 witnesses who attested to Hartwig's 
"professional delusions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brags in Letter 
</P>
<P>
Hartwig, for instance, told friends that the April 19 firing would be his last 
before being transferred to London to become an undercover security agent. He 
bragged in letters home that he'd be wearing "three-piece European suits" and 
would be involved in "James Bond-type work." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy said it had issued no such orders for Hartwig. 
</P>
<P>
One sailor interviewed by NIS agents "volunteered that whenever Hartwig 
discussed killing, he talked in terms of extreme violence with total 
annihilation and mutilation." 
</P>
<P>
Another Iowa sailor said that Hartwig was very interested in "improvised 
explosives," and had showed him how to make pipe bombs and other explosives 
from shotgun shells and trip wire devices. 
</P>
<P>
In preparing and presenting its report, the Navy treated the subject of 
Hartwig's rumored homosexuality very gingerly. The Navy's official findings 
make no mention of his sexual preference, although NIS agents spent hundreds of 
hours interviewing sailors and civilian friends trying to determine whether 
Hartwig was gay. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of interviewees expressed belief that Hartwig and several of his friends 
aboard ship were homosexual, and there are numerous references in the 
interviews to Hartwig being taunted as a "faggot." 
</P>
<P>
But the report did absolve Gunner's Mate Kendall L. Truitt of any 
responsibility. An early theory held that a homosexual relationship between 
Hartwig and Truitt -- a relationship that Truitt has consistently denied -- 
played a role in the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that Truitt did not have access to the gun barrel during the 
critical few moments when the detonator would have had to have been loaded, the 
Navy concluded. Nor could Truitt have been certain to survive such a 
devastating blast, even if he had engineered it, the investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says He Was Teased 
</P>
<P>
A sailor who had known Hartwig on earlier Iowa cruises said Hartwig often 
discussed suicide, particularly after he had been teased about being a 
homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
Hartwig had been disciplined in 1987 after being caught wrestling with another 
sailor in front of one of the gun turrets. The incident helped fuel Hartwig's 
reputation aboard ship as a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
One former Iowa crew member, himself gay, told investigators that Hartwig had 
confided to him that he was homosexual and did not enjoy serving aboard the 
Iowa because he was ostracized by most of the other sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Hartwig also told this sailor, referring to the battleship, that he wanted to 
"blow it up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Death and Destruction' 
</P>
<P>
One former crewman said, "Everything (Hartwig) did, everything he said, it 
always led back down to the bottom line of death and destruction." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the report's findings on Hartwig, the Navy said it does not plan to 
strengthen personality screening procedures, Adm. Leon A. Edney, vice chief of 
naval operations, said. 
</P>
<P>
"As we looked at this situation, we didn't see anything that required a drastic 
change or even any predominant change," Edney added. "The individual looked 
like a clean-cut sailor. He was a clean-cut sailor. He was a bright sailor. He 
didn't smoke, he didn't drink and he didn't carouse on liberty. He did his 
job."

S. AFRICA LEADERS SEE VOTE AS MANDATE FOR MILD REFORM

<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling National Party attempted Thursday to put the best face on an 
election setback, its worst in 41 years of rule, saying the slim parliamentary 
majority has given the government a clear mandate for modest racial reform and, 
ultimately, relinquishing some white control of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
But some political analysts said the government's heavy losses Wednesday, to 
pro- and anti-apartheid white parties -- and its inability to gain even half of 
the total popular vote -- reflect growing divisions within South Africa's white 
minority and might paralyze efforts to dismantle apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police and church leaders argued over the number of people killed in 
dozens of election-day clashes between police and anti-apartheid demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, criticizing "the brutality of this 
government," told a news conference that the police killed at least 22 people 
in townships near Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Deny Killing 22 
</P>
<P>
But a police spokesman denied the accusation, saying that 12 people had died in 
"mob and street violence" and only one person, a 16-year-old mixed-race girl, 
had died in unrest. She was killed when police fired shotguns to disperse a 
crowd that had fire-bombed a car, seriously injurying the driver, the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We invite Archbishop Tutu to produce the evidence," the police said in a 
statement Thursday. The police accused Tutu, the 1984 winner of the Nobel Peace 
Prize, of using a news conference to "propagate untested allegations." 
</P>
<P>
The black majority, which outnumbers whites 5 to 1, had no vote in the 
elections that brought the National Party-led government back to power and 
assured the selection of acting President Frederik W. de Klerk as South 
Africa's leader for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The National Party, which has had a firm grip on South Africa as the original 
architects of apartheid, saw its 123-seat majority in the controlling white 
chamber of Parliament fall to 93 seats, or 56%. The far-right Conservative 
Party won 39 seats, a gain of 17, which was less than had been expected. The 
surprise came from the anti-apartheid Democratic Party, which now has 33 seats, 
an increase of 13. 
</P>
<P>
The race for one of the 166 seats in the white chamber ended in a tie between 
the Nationalist and Conservative candidate, and a new election was called in 
that district. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said the strong showing by his left- and right-wing opponents will 
neither speed nor slow his party's plan for reform. That program includes 
bringing blacks into the political system on a limited basis while assuring 
that they cannot overrule white interests. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk also has pledged to begin a dialogue with black leaders, although his 
party's crackdown on dissent, opposition to a one-person, one-vote system and 
commitment to retaining segregated schools and neighborhoods have prevented 
similar attempts to attract legitimate black leaders to the table in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, the moderate leader of the 2-million-member Zulu 
nation, said the Democratic Party's gains herald "a new and very distinctive 
political era" in which "the National Party will have to look over its left 
shoulder and not its right shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Plans to Change Course 
</P>
<P>
But De Klerk said he has no intention of deviating from his party's middle 
course, although he added that he is encouraged by the fact that his party and 
the more liberal Democrats, who want to abolish all segregation laws and grant 
equal votes to blacks, now hold 70% of the white seats. 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely clear," De Klerk said, "that there was an overwhelming vote . 
. . for policies which give full political rights in some way or another to all 
South Africans." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Conservative Party nearly doubled its strength in Parliament, its 
popular vote increased by less than 20%, indicating less support than it had 
expected for its plan to strengthen apartheid and deny political rights to 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our supporters were overly optimistic," said Andries Treurnicht, the 
Conservative leader. But he said the election has given his supporters "a 
stable foundation for future action." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has raised expectations in foreign capitals that he will quickly move 
to improve the climate for talks by easing a three-year-old state of emergency 
and freeing black nationalist Nelson R. Mandela and other political prisoners. 
But senior government officials in recent weeks have sought to lower those 
expectations, saying that they do not expect significant moves from De Klerk 
before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In his first months, though, De Klerk will have to overcome the international 
outcry that has followed his government's attempt to crush a five-week-long 
defiance campaign by black activists protesting apartheid laws and curbs on 
free expression. 
</P>
<P>
While some black protests have been allowed by the authorities to continue 
peacefully, many more have been broken up by police whips, dogs, tear gas, 
rubber bullets and shotguns. The authorities have arrested more than 2,000 
people in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, De Klerk defended the government's handling of the defiance 
campaign, saying the police had acted "with aplomb and in a very reasonable 
way." 
</P>
<P>
But anti-apartheid leaders argue that the police have provoked trouble in the 
townships by using their broad powers to order peaceful demonstrators to 
disperse -- and then attacking participants and spectators. 
</P>
<P>
A mixed-race police lieutenant, Gregory Rockman, said Wednesday that a white 
superior threatened to arrest him when he tried to stop officers from hitting 
bystanders and students picketing in a township near Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just hitting people," Rockman said. "They couldn't care if they were 
innocent bystanders or not. They were running after them even when they were 
fleeing, hitting them. It seemed to me that they were enjoying themselves, 
feasting on the people."

BRITAIN ADVISES QUICK REFORM IN S. AFRICA; 
</P>
<P>
SAYS THAT HOLDING LINE AGAINST SANCTIONS MAY HINGE ON PROGRESS

If acting South African President Frederik W. de Klerk fails to quickly use his 
election mandate for political reform, "then holding the line against punitive 
sanctions will be infinitely more difficult," Britain's deputy prime minister, 
Geoffrey Howe, cautioned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The remark, seen as a thinly veiled warning that British patience with 
Pretoria's apartheid policy may be running out, is considered significant 
because Britain has been the most adamant major Western nation to oppose 
economic sanctions as a method of trying to force South Africa to dismantle 
apartheid, its system of racial segregation. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Foreign Secretary John Major called the results of 
Wednesday's election in South Africa "a very formidable mandate . . . for 
progressive change." 
</P>
<P>
"It has no friends left these days, apartheid, and the sooner it goes the 
better," Major said. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's ruling National Party won its 11th straight victory in 
Wednesday's whites-only elections, but lost ground to opponents on both the 
left and right. 
</P>
<P>
National Party leader De Klerk, who took over as acting president last month 
from the ailing Pieter W. Botha, is seen by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 
government as representing the best chance for reform in the country. Officials 
here have said privately for weeks that they had reason to expect dramatic 
moves after Wednesday's balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher is believed to have made such moves a condition for a state visit to 
South Africa -- a visit much desired by the white regime there. 
</P>
<P>
London has steadfastly opposed economic sanctions against Pretoria, arguing 
that they would not work and that the West has a better chance to influence 
positive change in South Africa by keeping open its lines of communication to 
the government. Britain's position has helped to soften punitive moves against 
Pretoria by other Commonwealth and North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
countries, including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends Sanctions Stand 
</P>
<P>
Major, in a radio interview Thursday, defended Britain's stand on sanctions and 
carefully skirted the question of what specific reforms London wants. Howe, a 
former foreign secretary, was more direct when he spoke at a meeting of the 
Assn. of American Correspondents in London. 
</P>
<P>
"As De Klerk himself has said, he has a mandate for reform," Howe said. "We 
certainly hope, and I have reason to believe, he wants to use that (mandate). 
If he doesn't, then holding the line against punitive sanctions will be 
infinitely more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what actions and what timetable the Thatcher government would consider 
satisfactory in South Africa, Howe said: 
</P>
<P>
"We, with the rest of the Free World, wish to see the release of Nelson Mandela 
(the jailed African National Congress leader) and the opening up of genuine 
political dialogue between the government and the black majority in South 
Africa. Clearly, one would want to see that happening on a time scale that is 
identifiable and visible." 
</P>
<P>
Major said in the interview with Independent Radio News that while the election 
disclosed "a rapidly changing opinion in South Africa," it will still take time 
for the system to change. 
</P>
<P>
He continued, "The important thing is to make sure that (change) comes about in 
a measured and peaceful way and in a way that will stick permanently." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain's "influence of restraint on South Africa over recent 
years has been very useful, and I think the fact that we have not always 
offered all-purpose denunciation of South Africa has enabled us to retain that 
influence."

U.S. OFFERS TO MEDIATE FOR S. AFRICA, BLACKS 
</P>

The Bush Administration congratulated South Africa's ruling party for its 
election victory and offered Thursday to serve as mediator between the 
government and the black majority. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to working with all parties to bring the South African 
government and black South Africans together in a substantial effort to end 
apartheid," State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. "We therefore 
are prepared to work with the new government toward this end." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush sent a personal telegram 
of congratulations to acting President Frederik W. de Klerk, although Fitzwater 
insisted that such messages are "relatively routine," even in elections that 
Washington considers to be less than democratic. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler declined to say if the United States is ready to lift its economic 
sanctions against South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In a formal statement reacting to the ruling National Party's narrow victory in 
Wednesday's election, the Administration underlined its objections to the 
apartheid system of racial segregation. But the statement also echoed Bush's 
congratulations to the ruling party for winning an election that the U.S. 
government had earlier decried as unfair and unrepresentative because blacks 
were denied a right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We congratulate acting President De Klerk on his party's victory at the polls 
and for leading his party to win its mandate for real change in South Africa," 
Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that Washington has seldom used such warm language in reference to 
South Africa's tightly segregated political system, Tutwiler replied: "You keep 
focusing on congratulations. The message is a two-page message. There's more 
than just congratulations." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater added that U.S. policy toward South Africa is essentially unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not characterize these telegrams as any different from those sent to 
other heads of state in the same situation," he said. However, Fitzwater agreed 
with a questioner who noted that no similar telegram was sent to Iranian 
President Hashemi Rafsanjani after his recent electoral victory. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler emphasized that the Administration's offer of cooperation is 
conditioned on the De Klerk government's taking prompt action to bring the 
country's black majority into the political system.

HOUSE OKS FAVORED TRADE STATUS FOR HUNGARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The House on Thursday attempted to reward Hungary's democratic reforms by 
voting to grant the Communist nation most-favored-nation status for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was adopted on a 221 to 169 roll-call vote despite Republican 
protests that it would hamper President Bush's conduct of foreign policy. The 
bill's prospects for passage in the Senate are considered good. 
</P>
<P>
It would extend for three years U.S. government credits and loan guarantees and 
continue until 1992 the lower tariffs on imports from Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary has enjoyed most-favored status since 1978 by presidential decrees. The 
House action thus was largely a symbolic reward for Hungary's dramatic shift 
away from Soviet-influenced Communist rule and toward a Western-oriented 
economic and political system. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a historic surge toward freedom," said California Rep. Tom 
Lantos (D-San Mateo), who was born in Budapest. "Americans should be rejoicing 
that our values are sweeping through Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
But foes of the bill, such as Rep. Philip M. Crane (R-Ill.), argued that 
Hungary is still under Communist control and influenced by the Warsaw Pact. He 
added: "An open and democratic Hungary is a long way off." 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the bill came as Hungary hosted thousands of East German refugees 
who crossed the East German-Hungarian border in hopes of receiving asylum in 
West Germany. The decision to tear down barbed wire on Hungary's border with 
Austria -- literally tearing down the Iron Curtain -- also figured in the House 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
The symbolism of the action was diminished, however, by the sizable 
Republican-led opposition. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Budapest last spring, Bush promised to grant Hungary 
permanent most-favored status -- putting it on a par with nearly all of 
America's other trading partners -- if its Parliament approved a series of 
measures dealing with immigration and other reforms at a coming session. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Hungary, the only Communist governments to gain most-favored status 
have been Romania, from 1975 to 1988, and China, from 1980 to the present. 
</P>
<P>
Although some members argued for continuing the annual presidential extensions 
of most-favored status to Hungary, most argued that the Hungarians deserve a 
reward that would encourage other East Bloc nations to follow their lead.

SENATE OKS BILL INTENDED TO FREE JAILED MOTHER 
</P>

<P>
The Senate late Thursday approved a measure designed to free imprisoned plastic 
surgeon Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, who has been in jail for two years because she 
hid her 7-year-old daughter, Hilary, and refuses to produce her for 
unsupervised visits with her father. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan has charged her former husband, oral surgeon Dr. Eric Foretich, with 
sexually abusing the child, a charge that he has vehemently denied. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed the measure by unanimous consent just before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would place a 12-month limit on civil contempt jailings in child 
custody cases in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. It would apply 
retroactively to Morgan, who has been held in a Washington jail since Aug. 28, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
House OKd Similar Bill 
</P>
<P>
The House passed a similar bill in June, but it would limit all contempt 
jailings in the District of Columbia to 18 months. A House-Senate conference 
committee must resolve differences between the two versions before a bill can 
be signed by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of civil contempt is not to punish but to coerce compliance with 
the court's order," Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), sponsor of the Senate bill, 
said on the Senate floor before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Once it is clear that the civil contempt sanction will not coerce a 
recalcitrant individual, that sanction must be removed," Hatch said. "The 
failure to do so constitutes a deprivation of liberty or property without due 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Foretich, however, called the congressional action "a repudiation and a 
disenfranchisement of both my daughter and me." He said his goal was not to 
keep his former wife in jail but to get Hilary back. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Court of Appeals, Washington's 
highest court, ruled that Morgan was being held in prison unlawfully. But the 
panel's decision to free her was stayed pending a hearing by the full court, 
scheduled for Sept. 20. It was unclear if the oral arguments will still take 
place as scheduled in light of the congressional action.

FEC FAILS TO ENFORCE LAWS, SHOULD BE ABOLISHED, COMMON CAUSE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Election Commission, established 15 years ago as part of the 
post-Watergate political reform movement, has failed to vigorously enforce 
campaign finance laws and ought to be abolished, a study by the Common Cause 
public interest group concluded Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has followed "a pattern of evading tough decisions" on campaign 
finance, because of a stalemate produced by the partisan split between its 
three Democratic and three Republican members, the report charged. 
</P>
<P>
"The result is growing non-compliance with the law, to the point where the 
integrity of the presidential campaign finance system . . . is now at risk," 
Common Cause said. 
</P>
<P>
But the chairman of the FEC, in a tart response, called Common Cause's call for 
abolishment of the commission "unwarranted and reckless." 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Danny L. McDonald charged that "apparently this group's frustration 
with campaign finance laws enacted by Congress is inappropriately being vented 
on the FEC." He said the FEC's job "is to enforce federal election laws, not 
rewrite them exactly as the lobbying group wishes." 
</P>
<P>
The public-interest lobby reserved its sharpest criticism for the FEC's alleged 
failure to regulate the use of tens of millions of dollars in "soft money" by 
both major parties in the 1988 presidential election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Soft money refers to political funds raised outside of the federal limitations 
that apply to presidential candidates. Such money may be raised for voluntary 
party-building activities on the state level that include mass mailings, phone 
banks and other efforts to get voters registered and to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
However, critics long have said that soft-money activities frequently provide 
crucial support to a presidential campaign and that contributors of such funds 
give both parties a source of unregulated campaign cash. 
</P>
<P>
The Common Cause study noted that in the 1988 presidential race, the campaign 
organizations of President Bush and his Democratic rival, Massachusetts Gov. 
Michael S. Dukakis, raised "unprecedented sums of soft money," a combined total 
of $50 million from corporations, labor unions and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
But the FEC took no action to prevent these funds from being used "on campaign 
activities intended to help advance the presidential tickets," in spite of a 
1987 court order by U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Flannery that the commission 
must write new rules covering soft money, the report charged. 
</P>
<P>
"By its seemingly willful refusal to act, the FEC has sanctioned campaign 
activities that run counter to central provisions of the post-Watergate reform 
laws, including the statute's campaign contribution and expenditure limits," 
Common Cause said. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-money case, in fact, best illustrates the FEC's "pattern of evading 
tough decisions through partisan stalemate, or of taking actions that benefit 
the political parties at the expense of the public's interest," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
It said the commission's "weak organizational structure" features two results: 
unanimous votes on issues that benefit the political party system over the 
public interest and 3-3 ties on matters that favor one party over the other. 
The FEC chairmanship is rotated each year among the members, which leads to 
inconsistent leadership, the report said.

INCUMBENT YOUNG AND REP. CONYERS IN BITTER BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
DETROIT MAYORAL RACE IS A DONNYBROOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a virtually broken economy, a tidal wave of drug-related crime and a 
massive population exodus to the suburbs, Detroit seemed poised to reelect 
Mayor Coleman A. Young to an unprecedented fifth term this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 71-year-old Young's popularity had plunged as voters started 
losing patience with conditions in the city, earlier this summer it appeared 
that he would easily fend off the weak field of candidates challenging him in 
next Tuesday's primary. Despite his problems, he was still one of America's 
most powerful black mayors, commanding an impressive inner-city political 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
But then John Conyers Jr., a 13-term Democratic congressman from Detroit's West 
Side and one of the city's most prominent black politicians -- and one of 
Young's oldest allies -- stunned both Young and Detroit by announcing his 
candidacy just before the filing deadline in July. 
</P>
<P>
Now the campaign has turned into a real race, and Young is faced with his first 
serious political threat since he took office in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
With the bitterness that only ex-friends can display, Young and Conyers are 
engaged in a bare-fisted brawl, dividing Detroit's black community as never 
before. 
</P>
<P>
And, since the top two finishers in Tuesday's nonpartisan primary will face 
each other in the general election runoff in November, Young and Conyers seem 
likely to continue their bitter battle throughout the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a hammer and tongs race all the way to the end," says Jack Casey, a 
longtime Detroit political operative. "Young and Conyers know each other too 
well for it not to be." 
</P>
<P>
"It's gotten ugly," complains Young spokesman Bob Berg. "I think the 
challengers saw what worked for George Bush, and sort of borrowed the Lee 
Atwater playbook to develop their strategy for running against the mayor. 
There's been a lot of name-calling, some of it pretty vicious." 
</P>
<P>
Already, Conyers has drawn Young's ire for repeatedly describing him as "Big 
Daddy," and criticizing him as an out-of-touch, imperial mayor who has cut 
himself off from the outside world. Conyers says that he entered the race at 
the last minute because he was worried the city was going downhill too fast, 
and that Detroit could not stand another four years under Young. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing personal but Young is burned out," Conyers says. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Young has tried to rally the black community to his cause through 
suggestions that Conyers and his other major opponents, all of whom are black, 
are being supported by the white media to get rid of Young. The Detroit Free 
Press has endorsed Conyers, while the Detroit News has backed Tom Barrow, a 
conservative black businessman who appears to be running third behind Young and 
Conyers. 
</P>
<P>
A group called the "Black Slate," which has endorsed Young, said in literature 
released this week that "the powerful white news media is fighting to 
re-establish white control of Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
Conyers responded by calling the tactics "the most hypocritical, cheap, 
discouraging kind of conduct. There is absolutely no justification to keep 
dividing black and white." 
</P>
<P>
Barrow, meanwhile, has charged that Young is waging a "desperate fight to 
bolster his support with outright racial appeals." 
</P>
<P>
Young spokesman Berg denies that the mayor has made race an issue, but still 
acknowledges that Young "has always said that his No. 1 opponent was the 
media." 
</P>
<P>
Berg also notes that many of Young's supporters say they are fearful of "the 
fragmenting of the traditional unity in the black community" that has resulted 
from the challenge to Young. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, this year's campaign does represent the first time that the black 
community, representing an estimated 70% of the voting population in the city, 
has not been solidly behind Coleman Young. 
</P>
<P>
As the city's first black mayor, Young can still count on the support of older 
black voters, who continue to see him as a living legend. But many younger 
blacks, who don't recall Young's early pioneering years, are turning to 
Conyers. 
</P>
<P>
"I voted for Young before, and I was going to again until I heard that John 
Conyers was getting into the race," says 32-year-old Venus Thues. "I'm 
interested in saving our neighborhoods, and I don't think Young's attention is 
turned to that." 
</P>
<P>
But Thues' mother is voting for Young once again. "I think there is some 
sentimentality involved for the older people," Thues says. "They feel like they 
don't want to be disloyal."

BLACK JUDGE PICKED TO PRESIDE IN RACIAL ATTACK CASE

A black state Supreme Court judge has been selected to preside over the trial 
of seven men charged in the racial killing of a black youth during an attack by 
a white gang in Brooklyn, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Justice Thaddeus Owens, 70, bypassed the normal selection 
process because of the unusual sensitivity of the case, said Matt Crossen, 
chief administrator of the New York Courts. 
</P>
<P>
But Crossen said the fact that Owens is black had "absolutely no impact" on his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"There are rare cases in which public attention is so intense that the 
proceedings will create a lasting perception of the criminal justice system by 
the way the case is handled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the defense attorneys in the case were not immediately available for 
comment, but one said he had no objections to Owens and another called the 
selection "unfair" and "insensitive." 
</P>
<P>
Yusuf Hawkins, 16, was shot to death as he and three other black youths were 
attacked Aug. 23 when they went to the predominantly white Bensonhurst 
neighborhood in Brooklyn to look at a used car. 
</P>
<P>
The four were mistaken for friends of a young woman who reportedly had jilted 
one of the attackers and began dating black and Latino men. 
</P>
<P>
Owens, an Arkansas native, is considered a tough jurist who runs a firm 
courtroom. Earlier this year, in a case involving the torching of a synagogue, 
Owens told a packed courtroom his uncle had been the victim of a lynch mob.

VAN DE KAMP'S LIMITED-TERM PLAN BLASTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he threatened the career longevity of his fellow politicians en masse, 
Democratic candidate for governor John K. Van de Kamp was egging for a fight. 
Now, he's got one splattering all around him -- and the ambitions of most 
everyone in California politics may hang in the balance. Not the least of which 
ambitions are his own. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, California attorney general and longtime political insider, is 
gambling that in the 1990 gubernatorial campaign he can establish himself as a 
voter-pleasing outsider. One means: A ballot initiative limiting elected 
officials to serving only 12 years consecutively in any one state office, a 
cornerstone of a larger "ethics in government" package. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sounded Their Disgust 
</P>
<P>
Slowly at first, mindful they were his foil, legislators, particularly majority 
Democrats, sounded their disgust at this idea of curbing seniority. They 
courted would-be Van de Kamp rivals. They ridiculed Van de Kamp's record of 
service. Then, Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) took a 
bolder stroke earlier this week with an announcement that he would rush ahead 
with legislation to ban Van de Kamp and other statewide candidates from fund 
raising during this off-election year, just as legislators are prohibited from 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the reaction grew hotter when two of Van de Kamp's chief rivals 
denounced his term-limit proposal. 
</P>
<P>
State Controller Gray Davis said it was "crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein called it "arbitrary . . . a cheap 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein is an announced candidate for governor. She was interviewed in 
between campaign stops in Southern California. Davis spoke to reporters at a 
breakfast in Los Angeles. He remains on the periphery of the June, 1990, 
Democratic primary, and said Thursday that he would run against Van de Kamp 
only in the event Feinstein drops out. 
</P>
<P>
"As mayor," Feinstein said, "I served under a two-term limit. I am opposed to 
it. Everybody has a right to run, including incumbents. It takes a period of 
time to become effective, to develop the contacts that enable you to become 
effective. This is arbitrary and a mistake. . . . It's a cheap shot." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the Van de Kamp ballot proposition will not bring fresh blood into 
politics, as the attorney general suggests. Instead, Davis sees a "high stakes 
game of musical chairs" at the turn of the century as elected officials swap 
offices to keep their careers in politics alive. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the proposal, which still has to be drafted and qualified for 
the ballot with the signatures of more than half a million Californians, the 
12-year clock does not begin ticking until 1990. That means no one would be 
forced out of an office until 2002.

<P>
'Worst in Politics' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the term-limit deal is crazy. . . . It's like saying that after 12 
years of being a brain surgeon you have to become a heart surgeon. It's going 
to bring out the worst in politics," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp supporters welcome the increasing attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe they threw us in that brier patch," one delighted adviser 
said. The campaign figures that picking a fight with legislators and 
politicians is a proven strategy for reaching the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Ronald Reagan did it and so did Democrat Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
For Van de Kamp, the confrontation makes sense on three levels, his strategists 
believe. It gives the attorney general something to advance in the debate over 
political ethics. Secondly, it detaches him from his reputation as the 
Establishment's favorite man and gives his candidacy the cast of insurgency. 
Finally, it challenges the stereotype that Van de Kamp is overly cautious by 
showing him willing to make powerful enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the deterioration of the environment in California, of ethical 
standards, of transportation, of the ability to regulate and reform things like 
insurance, what harm can come from an experiment like limiting terms?" asked 
Richie Ross, campaign manager for Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 50 states, 50 laboratories for democracy. This is a reform that 
seems to have successfully worked when applied to the executive level and, in 
some cases, the local level."

TEACHERS UNION LOSES IN COURT OVER DUES ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The California Supreme Court, dealing a stiff blow to organized labor, held 
Thursday that the fees non-union public school teachers are required to pay a 
union may not be used over their objection for a wide range of political 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, in a 4-3 ruling, said that while unions may automatically deduct 
"agency shop" fees from the non-member's paycheck, they may not spend them for 
most lobbying, electioneering and recruiting activities. 
</P>
<P>
The high court, in an opinion by Justice Marcus M. Kaufman, said that with 
certain exceptions, such activities are not the kind of "representation 
obligations" a non-member can be forced to support. 
</P>
<P>
The majority rejected a contention by the California Teachers Assn. and the 
state Public Employment Relations Board that many issues extend beyond the 
control of local school districts, justifying the use of fees in broader union 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
"The costs of efforts to change the law by lobbying before the Legislature, or 
by campaigning for or against local or state ballot propositions, are outside 
the union's representational obligations," Kaufman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The court said dues may be used for lobbying and election campaigning only when 
the local school district enlists union aid in seeking legislative change. The 
money also could be spent when there was no objection from the non-union 
member. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling is likely to have wide impact in the state. At present, the CTA 
includes about 160,000 members, making it the largest teachers' union in 
California. An additional 40,000 non-members are represented by the union, an 
undetermined but apparently small number of whom have objected to paying some 
portion of union dues. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education is scheduled to vote Monday on whether to 
allow an election among the Los Angeles Unified School District's 32,000 
teachers on the non-member fee issue. About two-thirds of the district's 
teachers belong to the union. 
</P>
<P>
Non-members have strongly opposed the fees, with some objecting on the grounds 
that the dues could be used to support political aims with which they disagree. 
</P>
<P>
While the decision directly involved public school employees, an attorney for 
the victorious party in the case said its restrictions could also eventually 
apply to other state and local public employee unions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most sweeping decision of its kind," said Anthony T. Caso of the 
Pacific Legal Foundation, the attorney for William J. Cumero, a King City 
teacher who waged a 12-year legal struggle to prevent his $150 annual dues from 
being used by the union over his objection. "No other court in the nation has 
issued such expansive protections for employees." 
</P>
<P>
Caso noted that the provisions of a state law involving educational employees 
were similar to other laws providing guidelines for the use of agency shop fees 
collected by unions for other state and local employees. "The court's ruling 
today could well be applied in other cases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the California AFL-CIO, backing the teachers union in the case, 
were not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the dispute were provisions of the Educational Employment Relations 
Act, which permits public school districts and unions to reach an agreement 
requiring non-union members to pay a "service fee" to work for the district. 
</P>
<P>
The aim is to prevent non-members from enjoying a "free ride" by benefiting 
from collective bargaining without having to contribute dues to the union.

JIM MURRAY: RIVIERA HAS ANOTHER BELIEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time Noboru Watanabe played Riviera Country Club, he knew he had to 
belong. The initiation was reasonable -- $108 million. But of course, that 
included carts and green fees. 
</P>
<P>
That's probably the most money ever paid to join a golf club but golfer 
Watanabe not only joined it, he bought it. 
</P>
<P>
The repercussions were seismic. The buyout evoked the typical responses to 
Japanese investment in America: "Who won the war, anyway?" "What's next, the 
White House?" "Why don't we form a syndicate to buy Mt. Fuji?" And so on. 
</P>
<P>
Riviera is a golfing heirloom. Ben Hogan played here. So did Douglas Fairbanks, 
Mary Pickford. Humphrey Bogart used to sit out under the tree on the 12th green 
and watch the L.A. Open. Gable teed it up here. Babe Didrikson played her first 
round of golf here. A U.S. Open was held here, a PGA and 28 L.A. Opens. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors flew. Members bristled. The course, 168 acres of the finest real estate 
on the California littoral, a sycamore-strewn canyon hard by the Pacific 
shores, would be subdivided, they predicted. Or it would become a forest of 
high rises. 
</P>
<P>
After all, who would pay $108 million for a golf course? Why, you could buy the 
New York Yankees for that. Chunks of Fifth Avenue. Most of Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
The outcry grew so fervid, the purchasers resorted to the unusual tactic of 
postponing final takeover for a year while they preserved the fiction that they 
were only buying 49% of the club for the time being. Golfers were not fooled. 
Riviera was finished as a golf course, they told themselves gloomily. 
</P>
<P>
They reckoned without golfer Watanabe. He didn't so much buy Riviera as join 
it. He has joined that forlorn company, that long ghostly crew of Riviera 
members who are sure that, one of these days, they will break 90 on this 
chamber of golfing horrors. One day, they will get up the hill with their tee 
shot on 18 and one day they will reach some of the par-fours in two. 
</P>
<P>
Turn Riviera into a shopping mall? Noboru Watanabe shudders as much as Ben 
Hogan might. The Watanabe family owns enough things with elevators in them. 
They want to own some things with sand traps in them. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was finalized last week, and the 14th fairway is not a rice paddy, you 
can still buy hot dogs in the shack at the eighth green, score cards are still 
in English -- the Japanese word for one over par is bogey anyway, and one under 
is birdie -- and if you want sushi, bring your own. 
</P>
<P>
It is locker-room scuttlebutt that initiation fees for club membership in Japan 
run a million dollars or more. The supposition was, it might be cheaper for the 
Japanese businessman to play Riviera, even given the flight cost plus lodging. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe points out, though, that there are easier commutes from Osaka than 
Pacific Palisades. Hawaii, for instance. The Philippines. There may even be 
cheaper real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The Watanabes, who do business as Marukin Shoji, Ltd., insist they were not 
buying a golf course, they were buying a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"This is precisely why we bought Riviera, because of what it is and what it has 
been," Watanabe says. "We were in the building and leasing business and we 
wanted to diversify into resorts and leisure businesses. We knew the field was 
more advanced in the U.S. than in Japan. We looked into facilities in Florida 
and Arizona and other states but we didn't find one that was good for us. 
Finally, I visited Riviera. And I looked at the golf course and I said, 'This 
is it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Riviera has that effect on you. I thought the same thing 40 years ago, the 
first time I saw Hogan bring it to its knees. I thought it was only a question 
of time before I humbled it, too -- shoot, say, an 89. On my own ball. 
</P>
<P>
Riviera does that to you, too. It's like a coquettish woman who winks at you 
behind her fan. Gives you the come-on. But just when you think she's all yours, 
wham! You find yourself sitting on the curb with a wilted bouquet, wondering 
who's kissing her now. 
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, the great author, Dan Jenkins, stopped me derisively in the 
locker room at the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Gibby Gilbert just shot a 29 on the front nine of your course. What's so tough 
about Riviera?" he demanded accusingly. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't we wait till the back nine, at least?" I suggested. "Why don't we 
wait till tomorrow?" 
</P>
<P>
Gibby Gilbert shot a 37 on the back nine. The next day, he shot 80. That's 
Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
This is what Watanabe says he is buying: "We have no intention of changing the 
character or the tradition. We want to keep Riviera Riviera. We did not acquire 
it for economic reasons but for reasons of its historic presence. It is a 
matter of prestige for our company." 
</P>
<P>
It is Japanese to respect shrines, to honor ancestors. I do, too. Hogan and 
Snead won at Riviera. I wish Palmer and Nicklaus had, too. (At least, Watson 
did -- twice.) 
</P>
<P>
But if I bought Riviera, I would make a few subtle changes. I would move the 
tee on No. 18 up on the hill (right next to the ladies' tee). I would make No. 
9 a par-five (the architect liked to think it was a par-four). I would 
eliminate No. 12 altogether. I might want to put a plaque on No. 16, where I 
made my hole-in-one. That's because it's not only the only time I ever broke 
par on a hole at Riviera, but the only time I even made par. 
</P>
<P>
No, I wouldn't worry about anybody owning Riviera. Riviera owns Riviera. I 
think Noboru Watanabe knows that by now. If he doesn't, he will. 
</P>
<P>
And don't worry. If you ever want to bid on the club, wait some day till he 
comes up the 18th with his face red, smoke coming out of his ears, his ball in 
the elephant grass lying six, and he's already lost the nine, the 18 and the 
automatic presses. Make your pitch for the club then. He'll give it to you.

DEION SHOWS HE KNOWS THE SCORE, TAKES FALCON OFFER 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
Deion knows baseball. Deion knows football, too -- and starting Thursday, he 
hopes to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently hoping to join Bo Jackson as a man in the know in two professional 
sports, outfielder-defensive back Deion Sanders left the New York Yankees 
Wednesday night after the Atlanta Falcons announced they had reached a 
tentative contract agreement with his agent. Sanders, the fifth overall pick in 
the 1989 National Football League draft, was about to play left field for the 
Yankees against the Mariners when the agreement was thrashed out. 
</P>
<P>
Falcons spokesman Charlie Taylor said the agreement came at about 10 p.m. EDT 
after eight hours of negotiations in Suwanee, Ga., between team financial 
officer Jim Hay and Sanders' agent, Steve Zucker. 
</P>
<P>
No contract details were released. Sanders, a 6-1, 195-pound defensive back, 
had wanted a six-year, $10.75-million contract. The Falcons offered a five-year 
deal valued at about $4 million, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the Falcons wanted Sanders in training camp Thursday to take his 
physical and begin practice. After striking out in the sixth inning Wednesday 
night, Sanders was seen on the telecast at 11:20 p.m. shaking hands with 
teammates and leaving the Yankees' bench, carrying two bats and his glove. Luis 
Polonia replaced Sanders in left in the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, led by two police officers, then headed for a waiting cab and the 
airport, where he was believed to be headed for Atlanta. There were two 
late-evening flights from Seattle to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited," he said, "but I'm also very disappointed to be leaving the 
Yankees at this moment ... The Yankees have been good to me. Mr. Steinbrenner 
has been very good and I will definitely be back." 
</P>
<P>
Making the transition from baseball hitter to ball-carrier hitter, he added, 
"I'd like to play tomorrow if they had a game." The Falcons open the season 
Sunday at home against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 24 hours before the agreement, Sanders was a confused 22-year-old. He 
had ripped a two-run homer and collected his third and fourth RBI of the game 
with one of his two doubles in a 12-2 rout of the Mariners Tuesday night. And 
yet the glow of satisfaction he earned faded as he departed the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
He knew Wednesday would be a day of anxiety for him. Zucker, his football 
agent, was to meet with the Falcons. Sanders sensed that the Packers' signing 
of No. 2 overall pick Tony Mandarich on Tuesday could serve as the springboard 
for the Falcons making him, the No. 5 selection, an offer he couldn't refuse. 
</P>
<P>
So what does Sanders' athletic future hold? Baseball or football? Or both? 
</P>
<P>
"I will definitely be back in spring training," Sanders said before last 
night's game. "I'm not going to give up the game of baseball."

OBRADOVICH LOSES BUT HE'S STILL HAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Depending on how you look at it, Steve Obradovich is either unromantic or a 
great planner. What he isn't is boring. 
</P>
<P>
"Never a dull moment," the one they call O.B. said. 
</P>
<P>
There rarely is one with Obradovich, who once helped USC win a Rose Bowl and a 
national title in volleyball the same year (1977), and is regarded as one of 
the most colorful players in beach volleyball, his full-time sport of choice. 
But this week may be a topper. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday: He was married to his girlfriend of 1 1/2 years in a small, 
beachfront ceremony. Anticipating that this time of the year would be busy, 
they honeymooned ahead of time last April in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday: He played on the first of six nights of Great Western Team Cup 
Volleyball at the Forum. Happy actual honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
Today: He returns to work as owner of Julie's, the USC hangout/restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Obradovich nor his wife, Linda, find anything terribly unusual about 
forgoing a honeymoon to play in the tournament. It has been their way of life 
all along, the changing gears and careers from one day to the next. But beyond 
that, Team Cup, the only professional indoor league in the country, holds 
special meaning: Winning, all the time. 
</P>
<P>
While his beach career has been filled mainly with injuries and frustration the 
last four years, Obradovich, as a member of the championship team in each of 
the previous three years of the Forum event, has found unquestionable success. 
Only Jeff Stork can make the same claim. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got the best of both worlds," Obradovich said before Team Toyota beat his 
Team Reebok, 30-23, 31-29, under the event's unique scoring system. "I'm a 
businessman who makes major decisions with the restaurant and then I can go out 
on the beach and play volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
But not much longer. Obradovich, who has spent 17 of his 34 years playing 
competitive volleyball, plans to retire as a full-time participant after the 
Jose Cuervo tournament Sept. 15-16 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Other things are starting to take precedent -- such as the restaurant, almost 
constant pain in his left thigh and knee that keeps him awake some nights, and 
a baby due in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the happiest I've ever been in my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first match of the doubleheader before 1,589 fans, Mike Blanchard and 
Jon Root led Labatt's to a 19-30, 30-24, 11-8 victory over A'ME.

Tom Blackaller, a three-time America's Cup competitor, died Thursday while 
practicing for Sunday's sports car race at Sears Point International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Blackaller, 52, pulled his Sports 2000 race car off the track near Turn 7, 
apparently in full cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
He was treated by paramedics and taken via helicopter to Queen of the Valley 
Hospital in Napa. Efforts to revive him were unsuccessful, and he was 
pronounced dead at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Blackaller's revolutionary twin-rudder, 12-meter yacht, USA, was 
eliminated in the defender finals by Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Blackaller was the skipper of Defender, eliminated in the U.S. trials 
off Newport, R.I. He was the tactician on Clipper in 1980, skippered by Russell 
Long, also eliminated in the U.S. trials. 
</P>
<P>
Blackaller is survived by his wife Christine, and two daughters, Brooke and 
Lisa, from a previous marriage.

USC and flagship radio station KNX, had there been more time, might have 
conducted a nationwide search to replace Tom Kelly, a legend of sorts who has 
been announcing USC football on either radio or television since 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly will still be announcing USC football, but now on cable television for 
Prime Ticket. 
</P>

Kelly, dubbed Harry Hysterical by KMPC's Jim Healy, is sometimes criticized for 
being too biased toward USC. He's known to get more than a little upset when an 
official's call goes against the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
But Kelly, no question, had developed a following over the years, and when he 
left KNX for Prime Ticket last month, replacing him figured to be difficult. 
But the station had to look no farther than its own newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
Working there was sports reporter Pete Arbogast, a life-long USC fan who also 
had play-by-play experience, although not on a big-time scale. 
</P>
<P>
Arbogast was the Clippers' backup announcer and had also done some high school 
sports and USC women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Before hooking on at KNX in 1983, he had worked in smaller markets, in 
Victorville and Porterville. 
</P>
<P>
He had called such Tulare County biggies as Lindsay High School against 
Strathmore High School for KTIP in Porterville in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Did that qualify him for such a high-profile job as the radio voice of USC 
football? Some didn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
But Arbogast would appear to be proving those doubters wrong. He did a nice job 
on Labor Day, calling the Trojans' opener against Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Arbogast has a pleasant voice, was well prepared, well informed, smooth, 
surprisingly relaxed, technically sound and objective. He worked well with 
commentator Fred Gallagher, too. 
</P>
<P>
There were a few cliches: "Discretion is the better part of valor," and "The 
Trojans were up to the task." 
</P>
<P>
But overall, considering it was his first big assignment, Arbogast, on a scale 
of 10, turned in a 9.9. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and KMPC, before deciding on Paul Olden as Joel Meyers' replacement as the 
voice of the Bruins, came close to selecting Joe Buttitta, the voice of Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Word is that UCLA wanted Buttitta, who used to do delayed Bruin telecasts for 
Channel 5, but KMPC, and Jackie Autry in particular, did not. Buttitta was 
fired as Angel TV announcer after the 1984 season. That might have been a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
Another finalist for the UCLA job was Cal State Fullerton announcer John 
Rebenstorf. A KMPC source said he scored high for football but not as high for 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Working against Olden, who is in his first season as an announcer with the 
Cleveland Indians, was that he was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
But KMPC got Bob Starr to agree to double up and do both the Bruins and Rams 
this football season, paving the way for Olden, who is returning to his 
hometown in time for the basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
Olden, 34, a Dorsey High School graduate, used to work with Healy at KLAC in 
the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Healy, besides doing his 5:30 p.m. weekday show for KMPC, is also 
the station's sports director. So he had a say in the hiring of Olden. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, a KMPC press release regarding Starr's UCLA assignment last week 
identified Bob Steinbrinck as the station's news and sports director. 
</P>
<P>
Healy called to set the record straight, saying he is the sports director and 
Steinbrinck the news director. Steve Bailey is executive sports producer. 
</P>
<P>
New shows: In June, more than 1,500 people turned out at a park near Universal 
Studios to try out for a new television show, "American Gladiators." They were 
put through exhaustive physical tests. 
</P>
<P>
Similar tryouts were held in other major cities. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 20 people -- 10 men and 10 women -- were selected for the show. 
</P>
<P>
From the Los Angeles tryout came seven, including Joanna Needham, a motorcycle 
cop in the L.A. Police Department, and Terry Moore, a former UCLA linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Of his tryout, Moore said, "It was the toughest thing I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
Needham, Moore and the others were at Universal Studios a few weeks ago to tape 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
Playing games called such things as breakthrough and conquer, human cannonball, 
eliminator, joust, assault and powerball, they faced three men and three women 
hired to play gladiators named, for the sake of show business, Gemini, Nitro 
and Malibu; Lace, Sunny and Zap. 
</P>
<P>
Describing powerball, a game in which a competitor attempts to drop balls into 
a container while gladiators attempt to stop him any way they can, Moore said: 
"It's like playing football without pads." 
</P>
<P>
He had the bruises to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily publicized, nationally syndicated show makes its debut Saturday. In 
Los Angeles, it will be carried by Channel 9 at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The show, maybe unfairly, has been grouped with another new syndicated show, 
"RollerGames," a high-tech version of Roller Derby complete with a pitful of 
live alligators, the wall of death and the jet jump. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour premiere of "RollerGames," taped at the Super Roller Dome in San 
Pedro, will be shown on Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Television trade publications have been calling the two shows "crash TV," a 
derivative of trash sports, such as the old "The Battle of Network Stars," and 
trash TV, such as "Morton Downey Jr." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Howard, former award-winning sports producer for ABC who is the executive 
producer of "American Gladiators," said: "I don't know exactly what crash TV is 
supposed to mean, but what I think has been lost is that we have outstanding 
athletes, selected in a nationwide search, in legitimate athletic competition. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing is, they are playing games people are not familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Adamle, co-host of the show with Joe Theismann, said: "I think if you told 
any of the competitors this is a phony show, they'd take your head off." 
</P>
<P>
Said Moore, 27, an All-American prep player in St. Louis: "I was just as 
nervous before this competition as I was before any football game." 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Joel Meyers, who left KMPC for NBC, makes his pro football announcing debut 
with the network Sunday, and his game, Seattle at Philadelphia, will be carried 
by Channel 4 at 1 p.m. Meyers' partner is Paul Maguire. . . . The early 
National Football League game Sunday will be the Rams at Atlanta, with Steve 
Zabriskie and Terry Bradshaw. Verne Lundquist is Bradshaw's regular partner, 
but this weekend Lundquist will be paired with John Madden because Pat 
Summerall is at the U.S. Open tennis tournament. Zabriskie is an announcer for 
the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
A new sports magazine show, "InSport" makes its debut on Channel 4 Sunday at 
12:30 p.m. The show switches to Saturdays at 4 p.m. Sept. 23. Ahmad Rashad is a 
co-host and also produces the half-hour syndicated show. Cleveland news 
anchorman Robin Swoboda is the other host. . . . Channel 7 televises a one-hour 
special tonight at 7, "Football '89," in which sportscasters Jim Hill, Rick 
Lozano and Todd Donoho look at the Rams, Raiders, USC and UCLA. . . . Looking 
ahead: This season's Super Bowl will be played Jan. 28 at the Louisiana 
Superdome, beginning at 2 p.m., PST. CBS will televise it. 
</P>
<P>
Oops Department, and this was bound to happen: KNX's Fred Gallagher, reporting 
that the Rams had reached agreement with rookie Cleveland Gary, called him Gary 
Cleveland. Coincidentally, during the USC-Illinois broadcast earlier in the 
week, Gallagher, on a punt return, referred to the Trojans' Scott Lockwood as 
Gary Lockwood.

WORLD CUP TRACK MEET STARTS TODAY IN SPAIN WITH ODD FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BARCELONA, Spain 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight at the Montjuic Olympic Stadium, King Juan Carlos of Spain will open 
track and field's World Cup, a three-day meet that is being held for the fifth 
time since 1977 but still has to be explained. 
</P>
<P>
That is unfortunate because it has the potential of being one of the best meets 
since the 1988 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
The format, however, has yet to catch on so that anyone other than the sport's 
aficionados would notice. In other words, it is not the Olympics or even the 
World Championships, which have been in existence only since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
There are nine teams in both the men's and the women's divisions, including 
four representing countries. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and the host country, Spain in this case, have standing 
invitations. Also, the top two teams in the European Cup are invited. For the 
men, that is Great Britain and East Germany. For the women, it is East Germany 
and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The field is completed with all-star teams from Africa, the Americas, Asia, 
Europe and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand). 
</P>
<P>
Each of the nine teams is represented by one competitor in 36 events, all 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the sport's greatest performers are entered here -- Morocco's Said 
Aouita in the 5,000 meters, Great Britain's Sebastian Coe in the 1,500, the 
United States' Roger Kingdom in the high hurdles, Cuba's Javier Sotomayor in 
the high jump, East Germany's Silke Moeller in the women's 100 and 200, 
Romania's Paula Ivan in the women's 1,500, Cuba's Ana Quirot in the women's 400 
and 800, and Norway's Ingrid Kristiansen in the women's 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
But there also are two or three athletes in each event who will not be 
competitive. Good hosts they may be, but the Spanish belong in hardly any of 
the events, much less all of them. The same can be said for the Asians. Japan's 
Kazuhiro Mizoguchi is an obvious exception, having thrown the javelin farther 
than anyone else in the men's field. 
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation has discussed eliminating the 
World Cup, which now is held every four years, and scheduling the 
ultra-successful World Championships at two-year intervals instead of four. 
</P>
<P>
But IAAF President Primo Nebiolo of Italy said Thursday that there will be 
another World Cup in 1993, although a site has not been selected. 
</P>
<P>
Nebiolo said that the World Cup "unites the athletes of different continents." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps so. But he would have gotten an argument from the French Thursday, when 
their excellent pole vaulter, Philippe Collet, lost his place on the European 
team to the Soviet Union's Rodion Gataullin. 
</P>
<P>
Gataullin originally was in the World Cup as a member of the Soviet team, which 
finished second to Great Britain in the European Cup. But then the drug-testing 
results came down. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet shotputter Alexander Bagach tested positive for a banned substance and 
lost his third-place points, which moved East Germany ahead of the Soviets and 
into the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
But because Gataullin won the pole vault in the European Cup, it was determined 
that he should represent Europe, instead of Collett, who was the original 
selection and already was here to train. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, French officials walked around indignantly, which they do better than 
anyone else in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Africans, as usual, were waist-deep in intrigue. They had announced earlier 
this year that only athletes who competed in the African Championships at 
Lagos, Nigeria, would be eligible for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
No one, however, tells Aouita where to compete. So he did not go to Lagos. But 
he still wanted to come here to run the 1,500. Under pressure from Nebiolo, the 
Africans relented. 
</P>
<P>
But Somalia's Abdi Bile, the 1987 world champion at 1,500 meters, said he 
wanted to run that race. He also did not go to Lagos, saying that he had the 
flu and also visa problems. Take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
African officials announced this week that Bile will run the 1,500 and Aouita 
the 5,000, a race that he won in the 1984 Olympics and the 1987 World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Aouita is happy with the compromise has not been determined. As of 
Thursday afternoon, he had not reported for duty. Kenya's John Ngugi, the 1988 
Olympic champion at 5,000 meters who did go to Lagos, is standing by, just in 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The United States left its problems at home, along with some of its best 
athletes. Of eight U.S. individual champions from the Seoul Games, the only one 
here is Kingdom. Six of the seven others chose for one reason or another not to 
attend the qualifying meet, the national championships in June at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Jamaican-born but raised in Brooklyn and college-educated at Cal State L.A., 
Sandra Farmer-Patrick will compete for the first time in a U.S. uniform in the 
400-meter intermediate hurdles. She is favored. Her husband, David Patrick, 
will represent the U.S. men in the intermediate hurdles.

DODGERS GET MAD, GET EVEN WITH BROWNING, 8-2; 
</P>
<P>
VALENZUELA STOPS REDS ON SIX HITS FOR 10TH VICTORY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds warmed up Thursday, the word on everybody's 
mind was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds' pitcher was Tom Browning, who last September pitched a perfect game 
against the Dodgers. Lately, he had been approaching perfection, with an 
eight-game win streak and a 1.72 earned-run average during that span. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened? Considering the kind of summer that these two teams have 
endured, it was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Browning was shelled, allowing seven runs in three innings. Then Browning was 
mad, cursing Alfredo Griffin as he was scoring on Eddie Murray's three-run 
homer in the fourth. Then Griffin was mad and had to be restrained from chasing 
Browning. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after the Dodgers finished an 8-2 victory, Browning hinted that 
Griffin may have stolen catcher Joe Oliver's signs while standing on second 
base before Murray's homer. And now Griffin was really mad. 
</P>
<P>
Said Browning: "The thought (of stealing signs) crossed my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Griffin: "I wish I could steal signs, I would be a genius. Why can't 
a man just admit that he had a bad night? I go oh-for-five last night, you 
didn't see me yelling. To hell with that man." 
</P>
<P>
Who says September is only fun for winners? 
</P>
<P>
Before a crowd of 15,044 at Riverfront Stadium, Fernando Valenzuela threw a 
six-hitter for his third complete game; Willie Randolph hit his second home run 
of the year, and Jose Gonzalez and Murray broke out of slumps with three hits 
each. 
</P>
<P>
But all was lost in the mess created by Browning's long fall to earth. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Griffin: "Just who does Browning think he is?" 
</P>
<P>
For starters, he was 15-10 with a 3.03 earned-run average, but the Dodgers got 
to him early. 
</P>
<P>
After Griffin popped out to first base to start the game, Randolph homered to 
left field. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're stealing signs, then who was on second base stealing them when 
Randolph was batting?" Griffin asked. "I ask you? What caused that?" 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers got three more runs in the second inning, on RBI singles by Rick 
Dempsey and Randolph, and a bouncing RBI double just over third base by 
Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that last hit. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, after Murray followed singles by Griffin and Randolph 
with his 16th homer, Browning met Griffin as he was rounding third base. 
</P>
<P>
According to one player, Browning cursed and said, "Nice chink hit. Next time, 
I'm going to hit you." 
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing this, Griffin said he replied, "What are you talking about?" 
</P>
<P>
Griffin said Browning responded, "You, I'm going to get you." 
</P>
<P>
By this time, Griffin had crossed the plate. He turned, ran up the baseline 
past a jogging Murray and, with arms furiously waving, tried to reach Browning. 
Plate umpire Steve Rippley jumped in his way as a couple of Dodgers came off 
the bench to help keep Griffin and Browning apart. 
</P>
<P>
Browning was removed from the game, having allowed 11 hits and more runs than 
in his previous five starts combined. Afterward, he wasn't just sore, but 
apologetic. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so mad after giving up that home run, he was the first guy I saw. I just 
felt like yelling at him," Browning said. "I don't hold anything against him. 
He's a good competitor." 
</P>
<P>
The accusation that Griffin stole the sign on Murray's homer came from Red 
Manager Tommy Helms. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody on the bench was saying that Griffin was giving Murray the signs from 
second base, and I think that's what Tom was mad about," Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dempsey: "If we're stealing signs, we sure aren't doing a very good job of 
it. I think Browning should just probably admit it was not one of his better 
nights." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph had three hits to make him 10 for 18 in the first four games of this 
seven-game trip and raise his average to .283. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela (10-12), who won for the fourth time in six starts, has allowed 
three or fewer earned runs in 16 of his last 17 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Because of an airport curfew at Lindbergh Field in San Diego, the Dodgers had 
to wait until 10 a.m. this morning to fly out of Cincinnati. . . . Dodger 
Manager Tom Lasorda has taken a personal hand in the grooming of rookie pitcher 
Ramon Martinez. During Martinez's between-starts throwing session Thursday, 
Lasorda was in the bullpen with pitching coach Ron Perranoski working on the 
rotation of Martinez's curveball. "The way he throws the ball, he should have 
an outstanding curve," Lasorda said. "He throws it hard already, but he still 
has to learn the proper rotation. When he does that, watch out. I guarantee, 
he's going to be a good one." Martinez, 3-3 with a 3.54 earned-run average, is 
coming off one of his best starts of the season, allowing Houston one run in 
seven innings Tuesday night. He will start again Sunday in San Diego, facing 
the Padres for the first time. . . . Eddie Murray's seventh-inning walk 
Thursday was his 82nd. He ranks fifth in the league.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / MAL FLORENCE;

<P>
COACH'S BARK WORSE THAN UNDERDOG BITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some things never change, particularly football coaches saying they're worried 
about an out-manned opponent that they'll most likely beat by 40, 50, 60 points 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
However, Nebraska's Tom Osborne is aware that laudatory remarks about an 
outclassed team are subject to ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
The Cornhuskers will open the season Saturday against Northern Illinois, and 
Osborne, after cautiously observing that Nebraska "can have a good team," 
added: "But I do think it will be unrealistic for the fans to expect us to go 
out there and put on a tremendously polished performance because, No. 1 -- and 
I'm not going to say anything more about this because every time I do I get 
laughed out of the state -- they have a good team." 
</P>
<P>
Start chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Northern Illinois has a good team, in its class, one that had a 7-4 
record last season while beating the likes of Middle Tennessee State and 
Southwestern Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
And Northern Illinois did beat Wisconsin of the Big Ten last year, but who 
didn't? The Badgers had a 1-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska, beginning its 100th year of football, is ranked No. 4 nationally in 
the latest Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Cornhuskers don't figure to lose many games this season with a 
nonconference schedule of Northern Illinois, Utah, Minnesota and Oregon State 
along with the predominately weak schedule in the Big Eight Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State's Joe Paterno is also concerned, publicly at least, in anticipation 
of playing Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"We are coming off a losing season (5-6), and I think our kids are realistic 
that they are playing a very good football team," Paterno said. 
</P>
<P>
That losing season didn't include a loss to Virginia, though, as Penn State won 
easily, 42-14. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but Virginia does have an edge -- as Paterno noted. The Cavaliers have "a 
game under their belt." 
</P>
<P>
He could have said that the Cavaliers were belted by Notre Dame, 36-13, in a 
game that was not as close as the score indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Will a coach ever say, "We play Possum College next week and we just scheduled 
the game instead of having a scrimmage"? 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of mismatches, Oklahoma opened the season last Saturday by 
toying with New Mexico State, 73-3. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma led at halftime, 38-0. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State Coach Mike Knoll, whose team is 4-30 in three-plus years, put 
the game in its proper perspective when he said: 
</P>
<P>
"We got beat offensively, defensively, in the kicking game, and we got 
outcoached. But nothing is ever as good as it seems, or as bad as it seems." 
</P>
<P>
It was Oklahoma's first regular-season game since the Sooners were put on three 
years' probation last December by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. The 
sanctions prevent the Sooners from appearing on live television this year and 
in bowl games for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have something to prove this year," Oklahoma offensive tackle Mark 
VanKeirsbilck said. "We want to show the fans and coaches we are a class team 
and a good team." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's opening 19-3 victory over Stanford Saturday night in Tucson was 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
It was also an indication that it may be a long season for the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
In Dennis Green's debut as coach, Stanford couldn't consistently protect its 
quarterback, redshirt freshman Steve Smith. Moreover, the Cardinal, 
historically a passing team, could gain only 34 net yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford has an inexperienced offensive line, having lost five of its top seven 
players and three starters. 
</P>
<P>
How good is Southern Mississippi, which upset sixth-ranked Florida State, 
30-26, last Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden conceded that Southern Mississippi is a top-20 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Seminole halfback Dexter Carter has even higher regard for the Golden Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the teams that play them better watch out," he said. "They could 
be in national championship contention." 
</P>
<P>
Mismatch of the week: Miami vs. Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to get a victory under my belt just for the heck it," new Miami 
Coach Dennis Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
That's as good a reason as any, considering that third-ranked Miami is a 28 
1/2-point favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Surprising quote of the week is courtesy of Detroit Lions Coach Wayne Fontes, 
who said in assessing former USC quarterback Rodney Peete: "His talent has 
surprised us." 
</P>
<P>
Does Fontes live in a cave? In four years as USC's quarterback, Peete broke 
every meaningful school passing record, took his team to the Rose Bowl twice 
and was runner-up last year in the Heisman Trophy balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested USC Coach Larry Smith: "He didn't accomplish all of that by riding a 
bicycle around campus."

Brad Gossen passed for 317 yards and two touchdowns, and Steve Broussard caught 
a 66-yard scoring pass and ran for three other touchdowns as Washington State 
defeated No. 24-ranked Brigham Young, 46-41, Thursday night.

Gossen threw scoring passes of 64 and 66 yards in the first half to Tim 
Stallworth and Broussard.

A SHOWDOWN?;

GRAF, NAVRATILOVA ON COURSE TO THE FINAL

Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova can move another step closer today to a 
showdown and a rematch of their 1987 U.S. Open final. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Graf plays third-seeded Gabriela Sabatini (the player she beat in 
last year's Open final to complete her Grand Slam), and second-seeded 
Navratilova plays sixth-seeded Zina Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, 16-3 against Sabatini, said she will use her normal plan. "Just go for 
the shots at the right time, just try to step in and always take the advantage, 
to be the one who is dictating the game," Graf said. "I'll try to play my game, 
not theirs." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Graf was deluged with questions about her opportunity to complete 
the Slam after winning the Australian and French Opens as well as Wimbledon. 
But this year, Graf has kept a low profile with Chris Evert getting most of the 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she felt the same as last year, Graf said: "I don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova remembers that she lost to Garrison in the Open last year. 
Garrison's 6-4, 6-7 (7-3), 7-5 victory was her only win over Navratilova in 25 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always remember that loss," Navratilova said. "I'll always be sort of 
paying her back for that." THOMAS BONK

Here was Boris Becker's schedule in the U.S Open this week: 
</P>
<P>
1. Play a fourth-round match Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
2. Take two days days off. 
</P>
<P>
3. Play a quarterfinal match Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
4. Take two days off. 
</P>
<P>
5. Play a semifinal match Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
6. Play the final Sunday, assuming he wins in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
If you noticed a lack of days off between No. 5 and No. 6, so did he. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I think it's a joke," Becker said. "It's obviously for TV 
reasons, you know, for the bottom line -- money. They don't really care too 
much for the players." 
</P>
<P>
CBS has owned the television rights to the U.S. Open for 22 years and believes 
it is good programming to show both the men's semifinals and the women's final 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The three other Grand Slam events -- the Australian Open, the French Open and 
Wimbledon -- have the women's semifinals on Thursday, the men's semifinals on 
Friday, the women's final on Saturday and the men's final on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Becker said: "People should think about it a little bit. We are here to play 
great tennis and not for the money." 
</P>
<P>
The champion wins $300,000. THOMAS BONK

FOUNDERS S&amp;L IN RECEIVERSHIP; SALE NOW LIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government's newly formed Resolution Trust Corp. said Thursday that 
it has been named receiver for Founders Savings &amp; Loan in Los Angeles, one 
of the nation's largest black-owned thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials could not be reached for comment, but the move was likely 
made to set up Founders to be sold or merged with another institution. The 
troubled savings and loan has been operating under federal supervision since 
regulators seized it in September, 1986, and replaced its management. 
</P>
<P>
In putting Founders into receivership, the government transferred the assets, 
deposits, offices and liabilities of the thrift into a new federal institution 
and will change the name to Founders Federal Savings &amp; Loan. The effect of 
that move is to wipe out claims of stockholders and debt holders. 
</P>
<P>
As of June 30, Founders had $125.9 million in assets and $162.4 million in 
16,670 deposit accounts. The RTC said Founders will keep operating under normal 
business hours, managed by agents appointed by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Books, Records in Disarray 
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 31, Founders was the nation's fourth-largest black-owned thrift, 
behind Independence Federal Savings Bank in Washington, Carver Federal Savings 
Bank in New York and Family Savings &amp; Loan in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators said at the time that Founders was seized that the thrift was 
suffering from bad commercial and construction loans and its books and records 
were in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC was formed as part of the new federal savings and loan bailout signed 
into law by President Bush in August. The agency, which is run by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp., has more than 263 other insolvent thrifts under its 
control. The RTC was named receiver by another new federal agency formed as 
part of the bailout, the Office of Thrift Supervision.

2 TOP ITALIAN BANK OFFICERS STEP DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
UNAUTHORIZED LENDING TO IRAQ BY U.S. OFFICE IN ATLANTA CITED 
</P>

<P>
The two top officers of Italy's largest commercial bank, Banca Nazionale del 
Lavoro, resigned Thursday in a scandal over massive unauthorized lending to 
Iraq by one of its U.S. branches. 
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman announced the resignation of the bank's president, Nerio Nesi, 
and director general, Giacomo Pedde, after a five-hour emergency board meeting 
here. 
</P>
<P>
BNL revealed last month that its office in Atlanta had extended about 2,500 
letters of credit covering exports by U.S. and European firms to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Thursday, the bank said it had extended $1.72 billion of 
financing for exports to Iraq and had unexecuted commitments for a further $920 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Of the credits already issued, $1.02 billion covered contracts on behalf of 
Iraqi government bodies that were guaranteed by the Iraqi central bank. 
</P>
<P>
A further $700 million of credits were guaranteed by the U.S. Commodity Credit 
Corp., an arm of the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
BNL is under investigation by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Italy 
over the letters of credit, which were mainly to finance exports of industrial 
machinery and grain to Iraq. The bank says the letters did not involve arms 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planning Expansion Program 
</P>
<P>
While investigators have not said the credits were illegal, BNL has admitted 
its own regional management in New York knew nothing of the transactions, 
sparking criticism by the press and politicians in Italy over the way the bank 
was run. 
</P>
<P>
BNL, in which the Treasury has a 74% stake, was criticized for bureaucratic and 
inefficient management in a 1986 Bank of Italy report. 
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis broke as BNL was planning an expansion program involving an 
alliance with state insurance group INA designed to improve its position in the 
increasingly competitive European financial services market. 
</P>
<P>
BNL announced Wednesday that it had fired its Atlanta branch manager, 
Christopher Drogoul, and that it was taking legal action against him in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Thursday, the board said it was confident the bank's assets 
were solid. 
</P>
<P>
"BNL, like other big international banks, has overcome difficult situations in 
its past through its own strength and through the dedication of its staff, and 
the conditions also exist on this occasion for it to do so," the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The BNL spokesman said Nesi and Pedde would formally tender their resignations 
to Treasury Minister Guido Carli today. 
</P>
<P>
The departure of Nesi, 64, marks the end of an era for the bank. He has been 
president of BNL since 1978 and has played a prominent role in Socialist party 
politics, recently as a critic of party leader and former Prime Minister 
Bettino Craxi. 
</P>
<P>
Nesi was financial services director for Olivetti between 1958 and 1970 and 
then worked for several Italian banks.

RESCUERS TO SPEND $8 BILLION ON S&amp;LS THIS MONTH

Federal regulators plan to spend about $8 billion by the end of September to 
restructure or close insolvent thrift institutions, Federal Deposition 
Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The figure is $3 billion higher than previous estimates, and an FDIC spokesman 
said the increase is related to FDIC's work on the sale or merger of five 
"relatively large" savings and loan firms with assets averaging between $700 
million and $800 million. He said the actions are on a "fast track" because the 
deals will not be structurally complex. 
</P>
<P>
The $8 million is part of $20 billion that the Resolution Trust Corp. is 
required by the new savings and loan bailout legislation to spend by the end of 
the current fiscal year on resolving the cases of insolvent thrifts. The RTC is 
the entity created by the bailout bill to deal with insolvent thrifts under 
FDIC's management. 
</P>
<P>
The other $12 billion will be used to replace sick thrifts' high-cost brokered 
deposits as they mature with lower-cost government funds, Seidman said in a 
talk at the annual meeting of the board of governors of the Mortgage Bankers 
Assn.

BRITISH CONGLOMERATE TO BUY PART OF DEL MONTE FROM RJR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
RJR Nabisco Inc. said Thursday that it would sell the fresh fruit operations of 
Del Monte to the British conglomerate Polly Peck International PLC for $875 
million in another major step toward reducing debt from its record buyout. 
</P>
<P>
The cash sale of Del Monte Tropical Fruit Co. moves RJR past the halfway mark 
in its efforts to sell about $5.5 billion in assets to reduce the debt 
accumulated in the $25-billion buyout of the food and tobacco giant by Kohlberg 
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Del Monte is the world's largest supplier of fresh pineapples and No. 3 in 
bananas. Its acquisition would make Polly Peck a major player in the fresh 
fruit industry by allowing it to use the well-known Del Monte brand name on its 
entire range of produce. 
</P>
<P>
RJR's plan to divest assets, particularly among its food holdings, began in 
June, when it sold five European food businesses for $2.5 billion to BSN SA of 
France, and its Chun King unit for $52 million to a Singapore syndicate. The 
following month it sold its biscuit and food businesses in India and Pakistan 
for $44 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We are significantly ahead of schedule in completing that plan," said RJR 
Chairman Louis V. Gerstner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Good Price' 
</P>
<P>
RJR said the amount received for the fresh fruit business was about 13 times 
the unit's projected 1989 operating income, a price tag generally in line with 
analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's a good price. Of course, it's not as good as what they extracted 
from the (European) snack food operations," said Marc I. Cohen, of the New York 
securities firm Sanford C. Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
John Maxwell, an analyst with Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va., said he 
expected RJR to proceed with plans to sell the rest of Del Monte as well, 
including Del Monte Foods USA and separate units in Europe, Latin America, 
Canada and the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Del Monte Tropical Fruit, with $600 million in sales of pineapples, bananas, 
papayas, mangoes and other fresh fruits last year, accounted for about a 
quarter of Del Monte's total sales. 
</P>
<P>
RJR had total revenue of $7.44 billion for the first six months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Polly Peck said it planned to finance the acquisition through a rights issue 
and from bank loans. It said it hopes to complete the deal by Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
The rights issue will allow existing shareholders to buy new Polly Peck shares 
at $3.77, or 245 pence, about 20% below their recent trading range. 
</P>
<P>
The London-based company also has operations in electronics, textiles and 
hotels. Its sales totaled $804 million for the first six months of this year.

Regulator Criticized: The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of 
Congress, said the Commodity Futures Trading Commission lacks ability to 
effectively analyze information on trading abuses and needs to work closely 
with futures exchanges as they develop automated surveillance systems to stop 
cheating. The report comes on the heels of recent sharp congressional criticism 
of the CFTC's alleged lax regulation of markets, a charge it has denied.

Lloyd's of London Had a Strong 1986: The Lloyd's insurance market, which 
reports results three years in arrears because of long delays in settling 
claims, said profits rebounded in 1986. It put pretax profit for the year at $1 
billion, more than three times its 1985 profit. Lloyd's Chairman Murray 
Lawrence said although prospects for 1987 were encouraging, results for the 
next three years would be less spectacular, with marine and aviation markets in 
particular unlikely to produce satisfactory profits in 1988 and 1989.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: SONGWRITER HELPS ASPIRANTS TUNE THEIR CAREERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jane Applegate 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the day, Greg Baum is vice president of a Kansas City stock brokerage. 
But after he and his wife Karen put their three young sons to bed, the Baums 
retreat to their home music studio to pursue their dream of being hit 
songwriters. 
</P>
<P>
"We do it every spare moment we have," Greg Baum said. "It's truly our love." 
</P>
<P>
But how can a couple from Overland, Kan., break into today's cutthroat music 
business? 
</P>
<P>
The Baums and dozens of other aspiring songwriters across the country turn to 
Santa Monica songwriting consultant Molly-Ann Leikin, who has turned her 
personal talent into an unusual small business. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost any kind of artist, a painter or a vocal coach, can create a business 
like this," said Leikin, who recently received a platinum record for a song she 
wrote that was recorded by Placido Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
Leikin's life has not always been filled with platinum and gold records. A 
former Los Angeles County social worker, Leikin started her business out of 
desperation in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom fell out of my life when singer-songwriters were all publishers 
wanted," recalled Leikin, a diminutive redhead from Ottawa, Canada. "I had an 
Emmy nomination and had written themes for 25 movies and television shows, but 
there was no work for me because I couldn't sing." 
</P>
<P>
For a year, Leikin suffered through a deep depression. She lived on her savings 
and cases of diet Tab soda. When the money was running out, she finally sought 
help from a career counselor. The counselor advised her to get back into the 
music business but to take a different approach and set up a consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Afraid of Being Sued' 
</P>
<P>
It made sense because Leikin had frequently critiqued songs for friends and 
colleagues at no charge. She also knew that aspiring songwriters had very few 
avenues for their songs because the music business was virtually closed to 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"Songwriters cannot get their songs heard because publishers are afraid of 
being sued" because they might be accused of stealing a song that arrives 
unsolicited, Leikin said. Agents are reluctant to represent unknown writers. 
And, Leikin said, few songwriters can afford to hire entertainment attorneys to 
send their songs around to publishers. 
</P>
<P>
So, Leikin took a deep breath and hung out her shingle as a songwriting 
consultant. She not only critiques the melodies and lyrics but also advises 
clients on what publishers to approach and how to reach the right singers for 
their songs. Very quickly, she gained a reputation as the "Dr. Ruth of Rock 'n' 
Roll." 
</P>
<P>
Like other doctors, Leikin's services are not cheap. She charges $125 for the 
first consultation, which includes a detailed critique of five or six taped 
songs. Follow-up sessions are $95. She also offers a package deal of eight 
sessions for $650. 
</P>
<P>
"I help songwriters make sure they have a complete script for a record," said 
Leikin, whose songs have been recorded by Anne Murray, Cher, Karen Carpenter 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
Among her current clients are a doctor, an attorney, an advertising executive, 
a caterer and an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear the songs my clients are writing and I get goose bumps," said Leikin, 
who credits Bob Dylan with inspiring her to be a professional songwriter. 
"Still, I feel my job is to tell my clients the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Curtis, who performs Wednesdays through Saturdays at the Smoke House in 
Burbank, said Leikin's help gives him confidence in his songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was blocked, she unblocked me," Curtis said. "She has a good 
perspective on what kind of songs will be picked up in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
When Leikin is not writing her own songs or consulting with others, she is 
working on a full-length "musical fantasy adventure" with a local producer. She 
has also written two books, including "How to Write a Hit Song," being 
published in late September by the Milwaukee-based Hal Leonard Publishing Co. 
</P>
<P>
Leikin, who usually consults with three clients a day, says all her clients are 
passionate about one day hearing their songs on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to understand their motivation. She says a hit song can earn its 
writer and publisher $100,000 a year in royalties -- every year for the rest of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Many Businesses to Be Sold in '90, Study Says 
</P>
<P>
1990 will be the year of the seller, with about 35,000 businesses of all sizes 
expected to change hands, according to David R. Hoods, president of Geneva 
Marketing Services Inc., a division of Geneva Cos. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Geneva's marketing studies show that about half of the clients that it 
represents are selling their businesses because they are bored or burned out. 
"They have lost their risk-taking ability," Hoods said. "And many have become 
the bottleneck to the growth of their company." 
</P>
<P>
Selling may be a good idea, especially since foreign investors, who are fearful 
that the U.S. may someday restrict foreign ownership, are anxious to buy now. 
"Foreigners represent 20% of the middle-market company buyers," Hoods said. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate Financing Week recently ranked Geneva No. 1 in transactions for the 
first half of 1989. It completed 37 transactions, compared to 15 by Bear, 
Stearns &amp; co. and 13 by Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO HIT THE HIGH NOTES 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica songwriting consultant Molly-Ann Leikin offers the following 
advice to creative people who want to turn their talent into a small business: 
</P>
<P>
Be sure that what you are offering is original. 
</P>
<P>
Don't let anybody tell you "you can't make a living doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Do the best job you can for your clients. 
</P>
<P>
Always get paid in advance for your consulting services. 
</P>
<P>
Accept Visa and MasterCard to help your clients pay for your advice. 
</P>
<P>
Be very firm about cancellations and charge for missed sessions if clients do 
not give you 48 hours' notice. 
</P>
<P>
Insist that clients arrive on time for their appointments because you are 
training them to be professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Don't give free advice once you decide to charge for your expertise. 
</P>
<P>
Keep an up-to-date computerized mailing list of contacts and clients. 
Periodically send out post cards to remind them of the services you offer. 
</P>

CELEBRITIES WAFT INTO FRAGRANCE FIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
On Tuesday, Mikhail Baryshnikov makes his first personal appearance at Saks 
Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills. Note the choreography: cocktails Monday night 
for 300 -- Kevin Costner, Kim Basinger, like that -- in a $14-million penthouse 
on Wilshire Boulevard. Caviar and California Chardonnay abound. 
</P>
<P>
Next day at the store, an autographing session from 1 to 2, with models 
spritzing perfume into the expected crowd of 1,000 and Baryshnikov signing his 
name in indelible ink. 
</P>
<P>
All this because the ballet star, whose stage leaps made him famous, is taking 
yet another leap -- into the world of fragrance. He is lending his name and his 
image to a $185-an-ounce perfume called Misha, his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
His gala fragrance launch follows close behind one for screen star Jaclyn 
Smith, whose California eau de cologne is a budget-conscious $17.50 per ounce. 
Because she has not been able to make time for personal appearances on the West 
Coast, K mart, Sav-on and JC Penney are promoting the scent in their stores by 
replacing Smith with life-size, cardboard dolls. And they will continue to do 
so until the real thing comes along. But her schedule doesn't allow for store 
appearances anytime soon. For now, the dolls will be as close as fans get to 
the former Charlie's Angel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sizzles and Fizzles 
</P>
<P>
Smith's 2-D look-alike is a symbol of one of the major problems plaguing 
celebrity fragrance sales. When stars are in stores meeting the public, scent 
sales sizzle. When they're not, sales tend to fizzle. And lately, there's more 
fizzle than sizzle. 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't stopped the push to get more eau-de-star on cosmetic counters. 
Baryshnikov and Smith join a long list of media celebs who have endorsed a 
fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
Recently there have been Cher, Joan Collins, Priscilla Presley and Debbie 
Gibson. Earlier, Elizabeth Taylor, Linda Evans, Catherine Deneuve, Dionne 
Warwick, Marlo Thomas, Sophia Loren and Candice Bergen. And Baryshnikov is not 
alone among men to introduce a fragance for women. Herb Alpert, Julio Iglesias 
and Smokey Robinson are others. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that none of these performers knew how to make or market a perfume was 
inconsequential to executives in the fragrance industry. The stars draw crowds 
and crowds mean dollars -- at least initially. Max Factor President Allan 
Kurtzman predicts that Jaclyn Smith's California will generate about $50 
million in sales its first year, of which the actress will get an undisclosed 
percentage. With Smith on hand to smile and sign autographs during its 
summertime "launch" week at Bloomingdale's in New York -- the only U.S. 
department store to carry it -- 5,000 bottles were purchased. But like other 
celebrity scents, with the star off premises, the fragrance became just another 
of the more than 800 different brands available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crowds Follow Cher 
</P>
<P>
Cher's recent seven-city tour with Uninhibited made the $175-an-ounce scent a 
hot seller during that time. She was able to draw huge crowds to department 
stores wherever she appeared. But as her film schedule and private life became 
more demanding, the personal appearances dwindled. Cher's scent proved to be 
one that her fans bought out of reverence for her, and others bought for 
curiosity's sake. But few came back for more. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the price tag keeps some fans from buying more than one bottle. 
Smith's California cologne at $17.50 is uncharacteristically low. But even her 
perfume, sold only at Bloomingdale's, is $200 per ounce. Others are priced as 
high as $300, which doesn't make repeat business a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
"For some manufacturers, short-term sales are enough," explains Bill 
Fitzgerald, a Washington-based economist who tracks fragrance sales for the 
industry. "Whereas most major firms want to see sales of $50 million a year to 
call a fragrance successful, some companies are happy with $10 million or $20 
million a year in sales. Others are in and out fast -- they do a big business 
during the launch period and then take the money and run." 
</P>
<P>
Even sales of Elizabeth Taylor's Passion, considered by most industry observers 
to be a major success, are tapering off. "Passion traded heavily on Taylor's 
name and ads in the magazines," Fitzgerald says. "Now the company has 
introduced bath products to generate more interest, but what they need is 
Taylor out there stumping to keep up the excitement." 
</P>
<P>
Sustaining that excitement is no easy feat, however. Loren's Sophia and 
Bergen's Cie were introduced more than 10 years ago, the first celebrity 
tie-ins in the perfume business. Today Cie is no longer available and "it takes 
a magnifying glass to find Sophia," as one industry consultant put it. 
</P>
<P>
So far only Passion, Deneuve and Evans' Krystal have been considered successful 
fragrances by industry analysts. But even Deneuve was a relatively short-term 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
With expensive packaging that included bows hand-dyed in France, "Deneuve was 
too expensive to produce," observes another industry source, who refused to be 
identified. "It would need to be $300 a bottle to make any money. So when Cher 
came along, everyone forgot about Deneuve." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deneuve Is Scarce 
</P>
<P>
The French actress' $175 perfume can still be found in some department stores, 
such as Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
Evans' high profile on the TV show "Dynasty," coupled with her commercial 
endorsements of Crystal Light soft drinks and Clairol's Ultress hair-coloring 
products, enhanced sales of her perfume. Now that "Dynasty" has been canceled, 
sales of Krystal will be based on the consumers' response to the essence, the 
true test of a fragrance's long-term success. 
</P>
<P>
Like Smith's scent, Collins' Spectacular was launched at Bloomingdale's during 
the store's recent California promotion. She drew fewer people to the store 
than did Smith, and sales have been notably unspectacular. According to 
Fitzgerald, who monitors actual consumer purchasing of name brands by 
contacting the shoppers, Collins' fragrance has not yet registered on his 
charts because of its very limited distribution. The fragrance is now available 
in Los Angeles at the Broadway, where Collins will make a personal appearance 
Nov. 9 (the Glendale Galleria store) and 10 (the South Coast Plaza store). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Men Bank on Charisma 
</P>
<P>
Male stars, anxious to get in on the action, bank on their romantic charisma to 
sell fragrances for women. The industry turns to sensitive male images, 
including that of Baryshnikov, to attract fragrance-buying females. 
</P>
<P>
Known for his soulful music, Smokey Robinson will sell his Smoke fragrance by 
mail, promoting it via scent strips distributed at his concerts and in his 
albums. The price is $29.50 for 1.7 ounces of eau de parfum, which is stronger 
than a cologne. Robinson isn't offering a perfume at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Madrid-born Iglesias, marketing specifically to Hispanic women, plays up the 
romantic angle in publicity for his scent Only, when he intones, "For all that 
women have given me, I wanted to give them something in return; something that 
would speak intimately to each and every woman the world over." It will cost 
them $200 per ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov, on the other hand, is promoted as the consummate artist, and his 
artistic sense is at the heart of the campaign: "Fragrance is like an 
'internal' companion, the bridge connecting a woman's hidden emotional self 
with the visual self . . . a kind of emotional dance." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, pop musician Herb Alpert's Listen was sold in too few stores to 
make an appearance on Fitzgerald's national sales reports. Now, sold in 300 
stores, enough to make a retail impact, its true popularity will be tested. 
Alpert's personal-appearance schedule has been very limited. 
</P>
<P>
While the French and Italians are accustomed to fragrances by celebrity fashion 
designers, entertainment industry scents are an American anachronism. In Paris, 
where perfume is as much a part of its heritage as wine, food or fashion, the 
nose -- the man or woman who blends the fragrance -- is most often the media 
star. For example, when the House of Guerlain launches its new perfume, 
Samsara, this fall, nose Jean-Paul Guerlain will tour the world to discuss his 
newest essence. 
</P>
<P>
And when Annick Goutal, one of the few female noses to head a French perfume 
company, began selling her exclusive collection at Bergdorf Goodman in New York 
and I. Magnin here, it was she, not 15 fragrances, that was promoted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credit to Creator 
</P>
<P>
"I could never create a perfume and then attach a celebrity's name to it," says 
Goutal, who received substantial media attention when she sued Parfums 
International, maker of Taylor's fragrance, for using the name Passion, which 
she had trademarked and used for several years on one of her best-selling 
perfumes. "The scent would be my interpretation of the star, not the star's 
expression of herself. To put a movie star's name on a fragrance is a 
vulgarization -- the credit belongs to the original creator." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, such "vulgarization" continues with no end in sight. But 
the trend is not without limits. 
</P>
<P>
So far there is no Rambo's Girl by Sylvester Stallone, or Terminator for Women 
by Arnold Schwarzenegger, because the actors' images don't fit the sensitive, 
romantic mold that has proven to be successful. Nor is there a Madonna perfume 
in the works. 
</P>
<P>
"Her personal life is too stormy," one industry source explains. "No 
manufacturer is willing to take a chance that the public will want to smell 
like her."

When Zsa Zsa Gabor, queen of carats, goes for her day in court Monday, don't 
expect to see her swathed in her usual get-up of diamonds and furs. Gabor tells 
Listen she is going to dress in basic black and pearls. "I'm going to wear my 
black Donna Karan. She's been my favorite designer for the last year, you know, 
dah-link, her clothes fit me so well." The Karan black wool wrap-around style 
is one of many by the same designer that Gabor says she buys in Palm Beach and 
wherever she finds them on sale. "I love to buy things on sale," she confesses. 
As for accessories, she says she will stick with her pearls, and as an 
afterthought, maybe will add a rose, but not a hat. "My hair will be done 
beautifully by Michael Disney," she says. (He has a salon in Los Angeles.) 
That's a switch from her regular, Julius Bengtsson, who also styles Nancy 
Reagan's hair. It sounds as if he's been busy. "If I waited for him, I'd be 
doing it myself in the bathtub," Gabor says. She hasn't made any wardrobe plans 
beyond day one of her court appearances.

Arsenio Goes Italian 
</P>
<P>
Get ready to see Arsenio Hall in nothing but custom-tailored, double-breasted 
Italian suits when he hosts his talk show on Channel 13 this fall. Along with 
the debonair suits by Canali, the genial host will turn up in zippy accessories 
that range from lapel pins, wide ties and tie clips down to "beautifully 
patterned socks," says Sami Dinar, whose Beverly Hills' menswear store is 
responsible for Hall's new sartorial image.

Mystery Designer 
</P>
<P>
Superstars Oscar de la Renta, Bill Blass and Adolfo hit the road a dozen times 
a year to hype their collections nationwide. And then there is Linda Allard. 
Hardly anybody recognizes her name, even though her high-profile client list 
includes newswomen Mary Alice Williams, Deborah Norville, Tawny Little and 
Tritia Toyota, all of whom probably think of her as Ellen Tracy -- the label 
she designs for. In her first Southland store emergence in about a decade, at 
Bullock's, Allard kept a low, low, low profile. But Listen heard enough about 
her to compile a thumbnail sketch, which ought to please her silent silent 
majority fans (wholesale sales are a walloping $150 million per year, she 
says.) Allard joined the Ellen Tracy company in 1962; five years ago her name 
went on the label alongside the fictitious Tracy. Fortysomething, she is single 
("Basically my life style revolves around my work."), a benefactor of the 
American Ballet Theatre and she spends weekends in Connecticut. Current 
airplane reading material: "Solitude" by Anthony Storr.

OPERA OPENER SETS TONE FOR SOCIAL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let women in other cities wear dresses out to there. On opening night of the 
Los Angeles Music Center Opera's fourth season Wednesday, the formal wear was 
decidedly low key. Surfaces that sparkled were left at home; no, this didn't 
look anything like the Academy Awards. Gowns were long, straight and even 
somewhat practical. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, a slender dress fits into the seat better," noted Joan Hotchkis, gala 
co-chair with Nancy Vreeland. Both women wore narrow columns -- Vreeland's 
designed by Bill Blass, Hotchkis' from Stanley Platos. "It's difficult to 
manipulate all that dress when you're sitting," echoed Giorgiana Montalban. 
</P>
<P>
When the curtain went up for this new, modernized-by-a-century production of 
"Tosca," it was clear that opera, and the benefit party that ushers in a new 
season, are already starting to feel like they've been around a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here many times," said producer and former 20th Century Fox 
President Leonard Goldberg during an elbow-to-elbow intermission crush in the 
Founders Room of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, "and tonight you can sense the 
excitement in this room. This is really impressive," he added before launching 
into yet another discourse about the opera with architect Tim Vreeland. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, the torturers are so well dressed," noted Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," nodded Vreeland. "It's a rather perverse idea." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, all evening long, dialogues continued on Giacomo Puccini's melodrama of 
love and political repression -- with various levels of connoisseurship. 
"You're going to love the third act," cracked one cogniscento. "It's murder." 
Some, like artist David Hockney, had seen "Tosca" performed all over the world. 
"I even saw one in Mexico City once," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But for others, the opera was an awakening. Barbara Davis, whose husband, 
Marvin, has now joined the ranks of restaurateurs with his new Carnegie Deli, 
enthused: "I just sat there and thought, this is the most inspiring, beautiful 
opera I've ever seen, and being able to read the screen I could feel everything 
Tosca was feeling." 
</P>
<P>
After the ovations, some 750 supporters paying $600 apiece trekked over a red 
carpet across the street to the Los Angeles County Mall for dancing and dining, 
trattoria style. With both the performance and dinner underwritten by Merrill 
Lynch, proceeds from the party are expected to be in the neighborhood of 
$300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a cue from the opera's Roman setting, the mall was rather miraculously 
transformed into an Italian piazza complete with outdoor cafe lights strung 
from end to end. "We even have the fountain," pointed out Joan Hotchkis. No, 
not the Trevi -- this particular fountain belongs to Los Angeles, although no 
one could recall its name. "It's probably called 'Supervisor Edelman's 
fountain.' I don't know," shrugged Hotchkis. 
</P>
<P>
"Tosca" star Maria Ewing, dressed diva-like in silver sequined gown and 
rhinestone-studded shoes, made a late entrance to the party with her 7-year-old 
daughter, Rebecca Hall, as did stars Justino Diaz, Neil Shicoff and conductor 
Placido Domingo with his wife, Marta. 
</P>
<P>
Domingo, having arrived from a performance at the Salzburg festival in Austria, 
and scheduled to open in "Aida" at the Metropolitan Sept. 25, seemed no worse 
for the wear. "People only write when you fly. They don't write when you rest," 
he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Seated at nearby tables were the glamorous Tara Colburn, a major opera donor; 
Gordon Getty (also in town for a Getty Museum meeting, he said); Swifty Lazar, 
who said he will be heading off to the New York opening of "Aida" as Domingo's 
guest; Georgia Frontiere; Michael and Laurie Milken; Betsy Bloomingdale and 
Martin Manulis; Music Center Opera general director Peter Hemmings; Sir John 
Tooley, former head of the Royal Opera of Covent Garden; Lenore and Bernard 
Greenberg (she's president of the Museum of Contemporary Art, he's president of 
the opera); Merrill Lynch's Stephen and Enid Koffler; Giorgiana and Ricardo 
Montalban; Fred Hayman; Peter and Annette O'Malley; Gordon and Judi Davidson, 
and Gerald and Robin Parsky. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, producer Doug Cramer took a look around the mall and surmised 
that if the opening night of the opera hasn't yet become the official start of 
the fall social season, "it's getting there." "If we go as fast as we've gone," 
he added, "in two more years it'll be the most impossible ticket in town to 
get." He may just be right.

Many pleasure boaters do not understand the dangers of sailing near large 
commercial ships and are involved in an increasing number of collisions that 
could have been prevented, shipping industry officials said in San Francisco. 
The waterways are crowded with water skiers, jet skiers and windsurfers who are 
risking serious accidents because they do not understand how fast ships travel 
or other dangers, according to the American Waterways Operators, the national 
association of representing the tugboat and barge industry

The Sri Lankan government invited Sinhalese and Tamil rebels for peace talks 
with all political parties in a bid to end ethnic conflicts in which 16,000 
people have been killed. Officials said that in the latest violence, 32 people 
were killed in two days by Sinhalese ultranationalist guerrillas waging a 
campaign of assassinations and strikes to try to topple the government of 
President Ranasinghe Premadasa. The guerrilla groups and 23 recognized 
political parties were included in the invitation to a peace conference Sept. 
13.

A Manila court began hearing an $810-million lawsuit against Ferdinand E. 
Marcos based on the former president's tax returns. It is the first case 
against Marcos that has gone to trial in the Philippines since he was ousted 
three years ago. In all, the government has filed 35 civil suits since 1987 to 
recover $100 billion that Marcos and 300 associates are accused of stealing 
during his 24 years in power.

ABC AD STRATEGY TAKES AIM AT LATINO VIEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Mark Zakarin, ABC Entertainment's vice president of marketing, remembers when 
he was a boy and his father would read a Jewish intellectual journal and point 
out the ads for Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like Ford cared about Jews in America," Zakarin recounted. "So he 
actually bought a Ford." 
</P>
<P>
Zakarin is putting that principle into practice and hoping to elicit a similar 
response for his television network with a first-ever pilot program to 
advertise selected ABC programs on Spanish-language television and radio and in 
print publications nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something that happens if you're the first network to speak to a group 
of people," Zakarin said. "It's a demonstration that you care. . . . What we're 
doing is, we're speaking their first language and/or the language of their 
fathers and letting them know that ABC cares about them." 
</P>
<P>
Some Latinos would question whether the network truly cares about them, but 
clearly ABC cares to have this large segment of the population tuned in and 
watching its programs. 
</P>
<P>
"To ignore the fragmentation of the network audience and to not go after that 
audience would be a marketing blunder," Zakarin said. "So we're going after 
them." 
</P>
<P>
ABC research shows that Latinos watch 32% more television than Anglos, Zakarin 
said, and it also shows that many of the television programs and movies watched 
are in English. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the amnesty program, there is an increased assimilation movement on 
the part of Hispanics, and if English is your second language, watching 
English-language television apparently is something you do," Zakarin said. 
</P>
<P>
The $250,000 advertising campaign, being put together by Los Angeles-based 
Carranza Group, which has created Spanish promotional campaigns for 
English-language feature films such as "Red Heat," "Salsa" and "Romero," will 
kick off the week of Sept. 18 and will last about one month. Thirty-second 
television spots will air locally on KWHY Channel 22, and 60-second radio spots 
will be heard locally on KTNQ-AM (1020), KLVE-FM (107.5), KWKW-AM (1330) and 
KALI-AM (1430). 
</P>
<P>
Ads will also be placed in Spanish-language newspapers and entertainment 
publications. More than half of the budget will go to advertising in the Los 
Angeles area, where a substantial portion of the nation's Latinos live. Heavy 
emphasis will be placed on the other top Latino markets -- New York, Miami, San 
Antonio, Chicago and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Univision and Telemundo, the country's two largest Spanish-language television 
networks, refused to air ABC's spots, but Galavision, which owns KWHY, agreed 
to carry them. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a simple business decision," said Joaquin Blaya, president of Univision 
Network, the nation's largest Spanish-language network with nine owner-operated 
stations including KMEX Channel 34 locally. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hispanic market is becoming more and more competitive. We have a 
stronghold on the market and we want to do everything we can to keep it that 
way. It would be very much like CBS airing spots for NBC or vice versa. . . . 
We're not going to be promoting competitive programs -- with ABC or anybody 
else, for that matter." 
</P>
<P>
The idea to advertise in Spanish to the large and growing Latino market came 
from several sources. Zakarin said that a report for ABC by Strategic Research 
Corp. showed that Latinos preferred ABC over the two other networks and he 
wanted to capitalize on that preference. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a natural relationship that is forming," he explained, "what we 
should do is encourage and enrich that relationship, and that's what we're 
going to try to do." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign will feature Venezuelan-born actress Maria Conchita Alonso as a 
spokesperson and a Latin-themed jingle with the refrains: "ABC es para mi! (ABC 
is for me)" and "ABC! Si!" 
</P>
<P>
The ABC shows that will be promoted are Thursday night's "Mission: Impossible" 
and the new Western "Young Riders," and Saturday night's "Mr. Belvedere" and a 
new sitcom about a modeling agency, "Living Dolls." 
</P>
<P>
"We picked 'Belvedere' and 'Living Dolls' on Saturday because 'Belvedere' has 
popularity among Hispanics, according to research, and it's important to let 
the Hispanic TV watcher know it's moving to Saturday," Zakarin said. "The 
reason we chose 'Mission: Impossible' and 'Young Riders' is because both have 
strong action elements, and action seems to transcend language." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis McCann, Carranza Group's vice president, said that his research showed 
that between 70% and 80% of Latinos in this country are bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
However, such statistics tend to oversimplify the picture. Although more than 
60% of the nation's 20 million Latinos are of Mexican heritage, a sizeable 
number hail from a variety of Latin American countries. Research has shown that 
different advertising campaigns may have to be created for different groups, 
such as Cubans and Mexican-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Whether ABC will continue reaching out to Latinos will depend ultimately on the 
success of this campaign, which will be measured by ratings and word of mouth, 
McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
"The research department will do follow-up studies and will try to determine if 
it makes sense," Zakarin said. "I think it does. But in this world of very 
competitive marketing you have to look at every expenditure and look at it very 
hard and see whether it's going to be worthwhile next year."

NEW KIDS, VANILLI IN TOP SLOTS

Artists who were unknown as recently as two years ago hold down the top four 
spots on Billboard magazine's pop album chart again this week. Teen heroes New 
Kids on the Block remain at No. 1; dance popsters Milli Vanilli make a 
surprising spurt to No. 2, and Richard Marx and Paula Abdul dip to Nos. 3 and 
4, respectively. But the latest albums by two veteran acts who had been written 
off by virtually the entire music industry are also doing well. Cher's "Heart 
of Stone" sprints to No. 16 -- and has a good chance of becoming her first Top 
10 album since Sonny &amp; Cher's salad days in 1965. And Alice Cooper's 
"Trash" jumps to No. 38, becoming his first Top 40 album since 1976. Gloria 
Estefan's "Don't Wanna Lose You," her first single on which Miami Sound Machine 
wasn't billed, is the new No. 1 pop hit. 
</P>
<P>
* The Rolling Stones' "Steel Wheels" debuted at No. 44 -- a respectable but 
hardly spectacular start for the group's first album in more than three years. 
But help is on the way. The band's "Mixed Emotions" single enters the Top 30 
this week, and the group is in the midst of its first tour since 1981.

THE HOOFERS STEP AHEAD OF THE SINGERS AT MTV VIDEO AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Woe to all Madonna wanna-bes who have joyful voices but not happy feet. The 
full import of gotta sing, gotta dance never applied more than Wednesday night 
at the MTV Video Music Awards, which boasted a performing lineup full of 
hyphenates who hoof at least as well as they hum. 
</P>
<P>
The prime exemplar of this shift in pop paradigms was Laker 
Girl-turned-choreographer-turned-chart-topper Paula Abdul. Her "Straight Up" 
clip captured four trophies (for female video, dance video, choreography and 
editing) and her three-song production number on the stage of the Universal 
Amphitheatre was a highlight of the sixth annual edition of the awards, which 
were carried live on the event's namesake video channel. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul's live vocals were inevitably even more thin than her likeably girlish 
recorded crooning, but a routine that began with a spirited tap dance and ended 
with a crew of motley kiddies stepping up a storm rendered all attention to 
actual vocals moot. 
</P>
<P>
Also putting on the rhythmic ritz, with real precision and surrounded by two 
fellow dancers per, were the mockingly self-worshipful Madonna (opening the 
show with "Express Yourself") and the less mockingly narcissistic Bobby Brown. 
Less impressive were minimally choreographed rug-cutting appearances by Cher 
(baring nearly all, natch) and rapper Tone Loc (flashing his bulging tummy for 
a moment but otherwise baring minimal dancing skill). 
</P>
<P>
Since most of the instrumentals were obviously canned -- as if there weren't 
enough lip-syncs and hand-syncs, even Abdul's celebrated tap dance was in fact 
a toe-sync -- all these fast moves provided most of the real excitement of the 
show, which was gamely cheer-led for the second year in a row by obsequious 
host Arsenio Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Some live playing was evident -- Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi 
did a couple of pretty acoustic numbers ("Livin' on a Prayer" and "Wanted Dead 
or Alive"), their self-mythologizing hard-rock cowboy lingo somehow less 
noxious from guys sitting on stools than from guys strutting. And the Cure and 
Cher's band seemingly had their instruments turned on. The surprise finale had 
Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers joined by Guns N' Roses' Axl Rose for duets 
of "Free Fallin'," an excellent Petty ballad that Rose had trouble fitting 
into, and a raved-up "Heartbreak Hotel," which brought out the famous Axl 
screech. Softer-headed were the tape-bound hard rockers Def Leppard and a 
ridiculous-looking Cult of no personality. 
</P>
<P>
As further proof that this was not Memorex, there was infamous 
I-hate-chicks-ha-ha comedian Andrew Dice Clay, who lapsed into his usual 
foul-mouthed misogyny -- much to the alleged surprise of the producers. (Home 
viewers missed the amusing sight of producer Dick Clark coming onto the stage 
and glaring at Clay from 10 paces during the monologue.) MTV VP Barry Kluger 
issued an apology backstage and decreed Clay's banishment from the channel, 
saying that "Clay did not do this in rehearsal and we were very surprised by 
it." 
</P>
<P>
These high-profile celebrity appearances are what the MTV Awards are about, not 
the statuettes themselves, which carry little of the prestige of the Grammys. 
(Quick, ask the kid down your block who won for "Best Post-Modern.") The show 
is interesting mostly for its lineup and as a gauge of how increasingly savvy 
MTV is about being all things to all teens -- blacks as well as whites, in 
contrast to the channel's notoriously lily-white early days. Still, there were 
noteworthy surprises among the prizes themselves: 
</P>
<P>
No one can claim that the awards are stacked by MTV after the win given by the 
700-plus industry voters to Neil Young's "This Note's for You" in the highly 
regarded best video category. This was, after all, the controversial piece of 
satire that brought the cable channel a flood of bad publicity -- and enmity 
from Young -- for its refusal to air the video until very late in its shelf 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Another upset came in the male video category, which went to Elvis Costello for 
his stunning, touching "Veronica" clip despite more commercial contenders like 
Bobby Brown and Steve Winwood. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other winners: Living Colour picked up three awards for best group, 
stage performance and new artist. George Michael received the "Video Vanguard" 
award for career achievement. Madonna's clips claimed prizes for 
cinematography, direction and art direction, in addition to her "People's 
Choice" award for "Like a Prayer," voted by callers during the telecast.

ROSE-PERIOD PICASSO HEADS FOR AUCTION BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The family that sold Vincent van Gogh's "Irises" for $53.9 million two years 
ago will put a rose-period Picasso on the block Nov. 15 at Sotheby's New York. 
"Au Lapin Agile," a 1905 self-portrait expected to bring around $40 million or 
$50 million, has become "too expensive to keep," said Linda de Roulet, owner of 
the painting, in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
De Roulet, who inherited the Picasso from her mother, Joan Whitney Payson, is 
following in the footsteps of her brother, John Whitney Payson, who inherited 
"Irises" from the family collection. He sold "Irises" for a record price after 
another Van Gogh, "Sunflowers," brought $39.9 million at auction. 
</P>
<P>
De Roulet's statement said she was persuaded to part with "Au Lapin Agile" 
after another early Picasso self-portrait, "Yo Picasso," sold in May for $47.85 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Also like her brother, who established a charitable foundation from the 
proceeds of "Irises," De Roulet will set up a foundation for medical research 
and education. AIDS research and the research unit of North Shore University 
Hospital at Cornell University Medical School will benefit from the the new 
Patrina Foundation, said John Whitney Payson, speaking by telephone for his 
sister. Other causes will be decided on a case-by-case basis as applications 
for grants are received, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The family isn't distressed about breaking up the family collection, Payson 
said. "I'm sure Linda will feel as I did when I sold 'Irises.' I felt a kind of 
loss at first, but when I saw the grant applications come in and the potential 
of the funds, it was very exciting. It's an upbeat thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Au Lapin Agile" is considered one of the most important rose-period Picassos 
in private hands. Picasso painted it the year after he left Barcelona for 
Paris. Living with his mistress, Fernande Olivier, in the dilapidated building 
known as the Bateau Lavoir, the young artist frequented a local circus and 
began to paint harlequin figures. 
</P>
<P>
In the gaily colored 39 x 39 1/2-inch oil, Picasso depicted himself as a 
brooding harlequin standing at a bar. A woman beside him is said to be Germaine 
Pichot, a model whom Picasso blamed for the 1901 death of his friend and fellow 
artist Carlos Casegemas, who was in love with her. 
</P>
<P>
"Au Lapin Agile" ("The Lively Rabbit") is named for a Montmartre cafe that is 
still in operation and once featured a sign picturing a rabbit in a saucepan. 
Picasso originally gave the painting to Frederic Gerard, the proprietor of the 
bohemian cafe who hung it there. Gerard is seen in the back of the picture, 
strumming his guitar. 
</P>
<P>
The painting subsequently passed through two private collections before Joan 
Whitney Payson bought it in 1952. She was a philanthropist for civic and 
medical institutions, a breeder of race horses and owner of the New York Mets 
baseball team, as well as a formidable art collector. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Whitney Payson was known to collect Impressionist and Post-Impressionist 
works, including paintings by Gauguin and Rousseau, in addition to Van Gogh and 
Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
John Whitney Payson was only 12 when his mother bought "Au Lapin Agile," but he 
recalls the delivery of a big crate to their home in Manhasset, N.Y. 
"Unfortunately I was probably more interested in the truck that delivered it 
than I was in the painting, so my memories aren't very clear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Payson does remember that the painting hung in a hallway near the entrance to 
the library, where the family spent a great deal of time. Old family photos 
show that at one point "Au Lapin Agile" and "Irises" shared a wall. 
</P>
<P>
Linda de Roulet, who lives in New York, resided in Los Angeles in the '50s with 
her late husband, Vincent de Roulet. She inherited the painting in 1975 at the 
death of her mother and has carried on Joan Whitney Payson's philanthropic 
activities, serving on hospital and museum boards. De Roulet was president of 
the New York Mets from 1975 until the team was sold in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Is "Au Lapin Agile" just the second tip of the Payson iceberg? Will other 
family treasures be offered for sale in the future? 
</P>
<P>
"No other paintings are under consideration right now," Payson said.

HUD ADVISED COSTA MESA TO DELAY POLICY ON ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After examining Costa Mesa's controversial anti-illegal alien funding policy, 
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development advised the city not to 
implement it "until further notice," according to a Sept. 1 letter made public 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, which was not received until after the City Council voted 
Tuesday to make the measure voluntary, a HUD official said the policy's 
constitutionality is still being reviewed and that the outcome could jeopardize 
federal grants to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Peter F. Buffa released copies of the letter Thursday in explaining why 
he did an about-face and led a 3-2 vote to effectively shelve the measure, 
which would have withheld city funds from groups that assist illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
He said he led the reversal, making the ban voluntary for at least this year, 
so the city would not risk losing vital Community Development Block Grant 
funds, which HUD oversees. 
</P>
<P>
Although Buffa said Thursday that he knew the letter was forthcoming when he 
voted, he made no mention of it to the council. He said he didn't actually 
receive the letter until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not want to refer to the letter (during the council meeting) because 
then I would only be speculating in terms of what might be in it," Buffa said 
during a news conference. "This was at least to some degree my motivation, 
because I had been told about a rather clear directive from HUD not to 
implement the policy until further notice." 
</P>
<P>
In the three-paragraph letter, HUD advises the city not to pursue the 
anti-illegal alien funding policy while its Washington headquarters determines 
whether it is constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"Several questions have been raised concerning its constitutionality, 
particularly with respect to the Community Development Block Grant program," 
wrote Benjamin F. Bobo, HUD's regional manager in Los Angeles. "We are 
therefore advising the city not to implement the policy as it relates to CDBG 
funds until further notice." 
</P>
<P>
At stake is $809,000 in HUD funds that the city is expected to receive in 
1989-90, $121,350 of which is allocated for public service grants to a wide 
range of civic and social-service organizations. Block grants are given to 
cities and local governments by HUD, which issues guidelines on how the money 
can be used. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what is unconstitutional at this point," said Scott Reed, 
spokesman for the agency's Los Angeles office, which serves Southern 
California. "We felt it was important enough to forward to our central office." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said HUD might know as early as today whether the policy is legal. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa's policy reversal had drawn fire from fellow Councilman Orville Amburgey, 
who originally proposed the funding policy, with Buffa and Councilman Ed 
Glasgow in support. And the HUD letter did nothing to soften Amburgey's 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Buffa should have enough guts to say the real reason he's rescinding the 
policy," Amburgey said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey said the letter that influenced Buffa to change his mind is nothing 
new. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing more than we knew from Day One," the councilman said. "I think 
we've all said since Day One that if they would withhold the funds, then we 
would consider strongly that we would rescind. But (HUD) hasn't said that." 
</P>
<P>
Buffa said he still supports some sort of measure barring funds to 
organizations that cater to illegal aliens, provided it can pass HUD's muster 
and if the council can give "clear-cut guidance" to city staff on implementing 
the plan. In the original policy, health clinics were exempted. But beyond 
that, the council had never discussed whether the policy would have applied to 
all nonprofit organizations, which would include cable television, cultural 
arts and public service groups. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa said the city has received an "overwhelming positive response" for the 
proposal from residents. 
</P>
<P>
While HUD is trying to determine whether the policy violates federal guidelines 
that prohibit discrimination on the basis of national origin, Buffa said people 
are seeing the issue wrongly. 
</P>
<P>
"What we were trying to address here is people who are in the country 
illegally," the mayor said. "That immediately became associated in some 
people's minds with national origin. At least in my mind this wasn't a question 
of national origin. It's a question of people registered, which, in my opinion, 
puts it in another category." 
</P>
<P>
Buffa also wondered why the measure is seen as a constitutional issue. 
</P>
<P>
"To view this as a constitutional issue, you have to have the logic to assume 
that it's going to be implemented in a discriminatory fashion," Buffa said. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that he is up for reelection next year had nothing to do with his 
reversal, Buffa said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a change of heart I would have voted simply to rescind the policy," 
Buffa said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did he bow to pressure from opponents of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The outcry was not the point," he said. "The point was we're not going to do 
anything that would put the city out of compliance, particularly when we depend 
on an agency for our programs." 
</P>
<P>
In defending the proposal, Amburgey said that by supporting groups with illegal 
aliens, the city would be in conflict with Immigration and Naturalization 
Service regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be strange to me that HUD would recommend anything that would 
conflict with INS," he said.

COURT RULING IN O.C. DRUG CASE LIMITS CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER and ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writers 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court, dealing a sharp setback to prosecutors in a case that 
began with a fatal drug overdose in a Santa Ana motel room, Thursday 
drastically limited the use of murder charges against drug dealers and others 
who provide illegal narcotics that accidentally kill their user. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling allows Orange County prosecutors to try to reinstate felony murder 
charges against a Tustin man accused of giving cocaine to a 19-year-old woman 
who later died of an overdose. But it holds them to a higher standard of proof 
than they had previously needed to make their case. 
</P>
<P>
A badly splintered court held 4 to 3 that a drug provider can be prosecuted for 
second-degree felony murder in such circumstances only when there is a "high 
probability" that furnishing the drug would prove fatal. 
</P>
<P>
To permit such charges in unintentional deaths would "inappropriately expand" 
the law by reducing the seriousness of the act a defendant must commit to be 
accused of murder, Justice Joyce L. Kennard wrote for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
In a vigorous dissent, Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas said the majority's 
"unrealistic, unwise and unprecedented" ruling would effectively bar most, if 
not all, second-degree felony murder charges in deaths resulting from cocaine, 
heroin and other illicit substances. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas said the court's strict new requirement would be virtually impossible to 
meet because such drugs are not known as "so dangerous that death is a highly 
probable result." 
</P>
<P>
The court's ruling arose from the 1986 death of Jennie Licerio, 19. Licerio 
overdosed on cocaine in a Santa Ana hotel room and later died of acute cocaine 
asphyxiation. 
</P>
<P>
County prosecutors had brought second-degree murder charges, carrying a maximum 
prison term of 15 years to life, against Sandy Patterson, a Tustin man who 
prosecutors said gave Licerio the cocaine that killed her. 
</P>
<P>
But a Superior Court judge threw out that murder charge and was later upheld by 
the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court on Thursday reversed that appellate decision, allowing 
prosecutors to try to reinstate the murder charge but holding them to a tougher 
standard of proof -- that there was a "high probability" of death -- than had 
previously been required. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas J. Borris, who prosecuted the Patterson 
case, saw that as a partial victory since he had been barred altogether from 
bringing murder charges under the local appellate ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"At least now we have some chance. The door has been opened," Borris said. "At 
least now I'm in the courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
Borris said the ruling also allows the district attorney's office to consider 
murder charges in two similar drug-overdose cases that had been stalled under 
the recent appellate ruling in the Patterson case. 
</P>
<P>
But he and his boss, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright, acknowledged 
that their office may be hard-pressed to show that the people supplying the 
drugs in those cases knew there was a high chance that death could result, as 
required by the Supreme Court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Enright went so far as to say in the Patterson case: "We're hurting. . . . This 
looks like a pretty difficult standard to meet, and the timing is rather 
unfortunate, since we've been learning more and more about deaths from 
cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson's attorney, Julian W. Bailey, said he would be surprised to see new 
murder charges lodged against his client -- now in jail on a new drug charge -- 
but added that he was confident his client could beat the charges in any event. 
</P>
<P>
"He had no idea that (Licerio's) death was going to result. He was just a guy 
out having a party with some girls engaged in the same willful conduct as he 
was. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't a very educated or sophisticated guy," Bailey said. "Patterson's 
conduct was before Len Bias (the college basketball star who overdosed on 
cocaine). This was before President Bush's war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Lucas, in a strong dissenting opinion joined by Justices David N. 
Eagleson and Marcus M. Kaufman, argued that second-degree murder charges should 
be permitted on a less-stringent showing that furnishing the drug presented an 
"inherent danger" or "substantial risk" of death. 
</P>
<P>
"At a time when our society faces a serious 'crack' cocaine crisis of epidemic 
proportions, the majority's holding is particularly unwelcome," the chief 
justice said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling represented a clear rebuff to a coalition of state and local 
prosecutors who had sought a new weapon in the war against drugs by asking the 
court to give them more leeway to bring murder charges when death resulted from 
narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Although still allowing murder charges against dealers who try to kill the user 
or who knowingly provide a lethal dose, the court set a standard in cases 
involving unintentional deaths that will be very difficult to meet, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael D. Schwartz, a Ventura prosecutor who represented the California 
District Attorneys Assn. in the case, acknowledge the court had "virtually 
eliminated" felony-murder prosecutions for drug fatalities. But he noted there 
were still other means to charge murder, as when a dealer knowingly provides a 
fatal overdose or fatally tainted substance. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to give up," Schwartz said. "We'll still use all the tools we 
can in drug prosecutions, both in fatal and non-fatal cases." 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Public Defender Philip M. Brooks welcomed the ruling, saying the 
court had reached a "correct result" in curbing felony-murder prosecutions for 
unintentional drug deaths. It would be unfair, he said, to allow such 
prosecutions where death was unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is malice -- such as knowingly or recklessly providing a fatal dose 
-- let the prosecution prove such malice," Brooks said. "There are still plenty 
of weapons in the arsenal," he added, noting that prison terms of 10 years or 
more are often imposed for other drug-related offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The court's unusual voting alignment and segments of justices' opinions 
reflected the difficulty of the case and the uneasiness it caused within the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard, in only her second majority opinion since joining the court last 
spring, said the majority "share the concern" of the dissenters with the 
"tragic effects that the abuse of illegal drugs, particularly crack cocaine, 
has on our society." 
</P>
<P>
But she went on to say that it should be up to the Legislature, not the court, 
to alter the law to widen the ability to prosecute drug providers. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Edward A. Panelli, a conservative who along with liberal Justices 
Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard joined Kennard in forming the slim majority 
adopting the "high probability" test, also urged the Legislature to review the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I am uneasy because we have traveled very close to the edge of our role as 
judges and have come perilously close to becoming legislators," Panelli said. 
</P>
<P>
State law permits murder charges when death results from commission of a 
felony, even when the killing is unintentional or accidental. The aim of the 
felony-murder rule is to deter crime by holding criminals strictly liable for 
the consequences of dangerous acts. 
</P>
<P>
Statutes specifically provide for first-degree felony murder charges in cases 
of robbery, rape and certain other offenses, with punishment of from 25 years 
to life in prison. The courts have permitted second-degree felony murder 
charges for heroin fatalities and some other offenses, but those decisions have 
come under increasing doubt in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange County case, Patterson sought dismissal of the murder charge and 
an Orange County Superior Court judge agreed, finding Patterson could not be 
held liable for Liciero's death. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in upholding the dismissal, a state Court of Appeal concluded 
reluctantly that under recent high court decisions, Patterson could not be 
charged with murder. The panel said that while he was accused of "furnishing" 
the cocaine, the drug statute under which he was charged also could be violated 
in ways that were not "inherently dangerous" -- such as transporting the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County prosecutors appealed to the state high court, supported by the 
district attorneys association and other law enforcement officials throughout 
the state. While such prosecutions have not been brought often, authorities 
said they would welcome any new tool to combat the widening problem of drug 
use. Several other test cases have been pending. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's ruling, the justices gave prosecutors a partial victory by ruling 
that contrary to the Court of Appeal decision, a murder charge could be brought 
for fatalities resulting from the particular offense of "furnishing" a drug, 
even though the statute covered other drug offenses -- such as transporting a 
drug for personal use -- that were not inherently dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The justices ordered the case sent back to the trial court so that prosecutors 
can make another attempt to charge Patterson with murder. But to make the 
charge stick, the court said, they will have to meet a more stringent standard 
by showing that furnishing cocaine, in general, carries a "high probability" 
that death will result. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Patterson had pleaded guilty to furnishing cocaine, served time in 
jail and was released on probation while the murder charge was on appeal. But 
later he was arrested and convicted of selling cocaine to an undercover police 
officer. His probation has been revoked and he has been sent to Soledad State 
Prison, according to prosecutors.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: TUSTIN; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS PROPOSE PROBLEM-SOLVING AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Discouraged by what it calls local government's inability to solve neighborhood 
problems, a group of Tustin residents has proposed the creation of a volunteer 
problem-solving agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin City Problem Resolution Center would offer residents a "voice in the 
solution process" of minor problems, said Berklee Maughan, a retiree and 
25-year Tustin resident who is leading the effort to establish the center. 
</P>
<P>
Maughan said the idea would give residents more of a direct role in tackling 
city problems while giving the City Council time to deal with weightier issues 
such as growth. 
</P>
<P>
According to Maughan, residents of Green Valley Avenue in North Tustin have 
spent two years battling city officials in an attempt to resolve such problems 
as street-sweeping schedules and parking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our attempts to resolve our problems have caused the Green Valley residents to 
focus on why the city problem-resolution process has proven unsuccessful," he 
said, blaming that failure on a lack of input from citizens and lower-level 
city staff. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council agreed at the Aug. 21 meeting to research the proposal for 
45 days, at least one member has voiced disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
Saying such an intermediary group would only serve to "dilute the 
effectiveness" of the council, Councilman Richard B. Edgar said Tustin should 
work instead to better inform its residents about the workings of local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"The real challenge is to make people come before the City Council when they 
need a problem solved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At this week's Tustin council meeting, Maughan suggested to the council that 
the city poll its residents on the desirability of creating such a group. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is an issue the people need to speak out on," he said.

CITY TO SPONSOR BOOTH AT TRADE FAIR IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton has decided to set up a booth to promote the city during a November 
trade fair in Fukui, Japan, city officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton booth at the Fukui trade fair will include a video narrated in 
Japanese, photographs and information about the city, and perhaps sample 
products from Fullerton manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unanimously agreed earlier this week to send the display 
materials to Fukui and create a formal sister-city relationship. The council 
budgeted up to $15,000 for sister-city activities. 
</P>
<P>
Fukui joins Morelia, Mexico, as Fullerton's other sister city. 
</P>
<P>
For the past few years, groups in Fullerton and Fukui have participated in 
student exchanges and visits, and Fukui then asked Fullerton to become its 
sister city.

<P>
FRIEND IS SUSPECTED IN SHOOTING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police in Anaheim were searching Thursday for a 38-year-old man they said is 
suspected of shooting and killing a longtime friend in his home and then 
fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found the body of Lee Madison Fox slumped in the bedroom of his house 
in the 1500 block of South Dallas Drive with a gunshot wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors told police that Fox had arrived home shortly before 10 p.m. on 
Wednesday with a friend, said Sgt. Chet Barry. It was unclear where the two men 
had been earlier, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, neighbors reported, a gunshot was heard and the friend ran from 
the home, Barry said. When officers arrived, they discovered Fox's body leaning 
against a hide-a-bed inside his single-family home. 
</P>
<P>
Officers recovered the apparent weapon, a revolver, Barry said, and interviewed 
neighbors who were acquainted with both men. However, investigators failed to 
come up with a motive for the slaying, Barry said.

TEACHERS STILL FIGHTING FOR HIGHER PAY IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers at the Anaheim Union High School District, who staged a one-day strike 
last spring, began the first day of school Thursday still locked in a salary 
dispute they had thought would be settled with the district during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not pleased at all," said Norma Potter, president of the Anaheim 
Secondary Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In June, teachers ratified a two-year contract that provides for a 1% salary 
increase for the school year that just ended, plus at least 3.2% for this 
school year. But the contract also said higher raises could be forthcoming once 
it was determined how much extra money the district received from a 
$2.5-billion state budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
The district has since learned it will receive about $5 million more than 
expected this school year. But in negotiations last week, teachers were told 
that they will not receive any share of the extra revenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employee Benefits Cited 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Cynthia F. Grennan said that teachers were, in effect, earning more money 
because certain employee benefits, such as medical insurance, have gone up and 
the district is picking up the extra costs. With that and other benefits, the 
raise actually totals about 7.2% for this year, she said, a number the teachers 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the salary dispute, district administrators said they could not 
afford a teacher pay raise because more than two years of declining enrollment 
had eroded their financial base. 
</P>
<P>
Grennan said the extra money, which amounts to about $259 more per student, is 
enough to balance the district's budget -- for the first time in 10 years. But 
she said nothing is left over for teacher salary increases exceeding 3.2% for 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Potter said the new contract prohibits any job actions such as another strike. 
However, she said, the association has told teachers in back-to-school 
newsletters to refrain from working any unpaid overtime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extracurricular Duties 
</P>
<P>
She said that would mean teachers would be urged to no longer arrive before 
school or stay late to allow students to talk over problems or ask questions. 
Or it could mean that teachers would no longer lead extracurricular programs 
such as a foreign language club or the science club, for which they receive no 
extra compensation. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be hard on students, and teachers don't want to do that," Potter 
said. "Most teachers will probably do it anyway even if we tell them not to." 
</P>
<P>
The one-day strike, when nearly 700 of the district's 900 teachers stayed away 
from the classrooms, has left bitter feelings in its wake, Potter said. 
</P>
<P>
When she took over as president of the association this summer, Potter said she 
went to the Board of Trustees to tell them that the teachers were ready to 
"bury the hatchet." 
</P>
<P>
"I told them there was a lot of fence-mending to do and hopefully we could get 
off to a good start and that one way to do that was to offer a fair salary 
increase," she said. "Apparently they didn't hear that."

POSTSCRIPT: A HAPPY CAMPER 5 MONTHS LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Ridgeway was back riding an all-terrain vehicle on a trip to Pismo 
Beach last week, and he felt great. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the first times he had been out riding since Easter weekend, when 
he, his wife, Betty, and daughter Robin, 26, visited an isolated desert 
campground in southeast California. 
</P>
<P>
That was before Ridgeway, 47, an accounting manager for Rockwell International 
in Anaheim, made headlines in March as the object of a frantic search, then a 
dramatic flight to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway suffers from a genetic disorder and needed a kidney transplant. When a 
rare donor kidney matching Ridgeway's B positive blood type became available, 
he was 200 miles away at a sand dunes campsite, near the Imperial County town 
of Glamis, close to the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
Through the efforts of the couple's son, Matt, 24, a search and rescue team and 
KNX-radio helicopter pilot-reporter Bob Tur, Ridgeway was found at the 
campground and flown to Orange County early Easter morning. He was taken to 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana for the transplant, with just six hours left 
before the donor kidney would have become unusable. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway was in the hospital just nine days and returned to work -- full time 
-- on June 5. With the new kidney, he has resumed a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are just going great," Ridgeway said Thursday. "I can't be more 
fortunate. There's the freedom, enjoying the food, the energy level." 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway has suffered from a genetic disorder that causes cysts to grow on his 
kidneys, eventually strangling the organs. 
</P>
<P>
He first learned about the disease in 1976. The only sign at the time was high 
blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Everything had been controlled until about two years ago, when his condition 
began to deteriorate. He complained of extreme fatigue and loss of appetite. 
</P>
<P>
In January, he started to undergo kidney dialysis three times a week to remove 
impurities from the blood. At the time, just 5% of his kidney was functional. 
Ridgeway was placed on a diet of low protein and potassium and high calories. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a choice, it's just what you do to stay alive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About a month later, he put his name on the list of candidates for a kidney 
transplant. Ridgeway did not expect a donor organ to become available quickly, 
because he was told to expect a wait of six months to three years. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the day before Easter, the hospital found him to be a perfect match for 
the kidney, which came from a dead teen-age girl whose identity was not made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"It matched me, and it didn't match anyone else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway's son found the campground after searching by car. Tur spotted Matt 
Ridgeway and picked him up, then the son directed the helicopter pilot to his 
father's encampment. The helicopter got the patient to an Orange County 
Sheriff's Department Search and Rescue plane, which then flew Ridgeway to John 
Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway was a bit apprehensive about the surgery, which lasted 90 minutes, but 
was confident that his choice to go through with the transplant would bring him 
a better life. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I had so long to consider things, I was ready," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the operation, he noticed that he had more energy, but there was a 
lot of worry that his body might reject the organ. 
</P>
<P>
"The most stressful thing was trying to get your medication regulated," he 
said. "You're warned. It's easy to become paranoid and a bit of a 
hypochondriac." 
</P>
<P>
About three weeks after leaving the hospital, his body showed signs of 
rejecting the kidney. Ridgeway returned to the hospital for three days, where 
he was treated with antibiotics. He has not had a problem since then. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Breckenridge, transplant coordinator for the hospital, said his body could 
reject the kidney at any time, even 10 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who is a transplant patient could expect more problems," she said. 
"They're taught to be tuned in to any problem." 
</P>
<P>
For Ridgeway, one of the best things since the operation is not having to 
undergo dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a big physical and mental strain," Ridgeway said. "Now, I just 
have to carry a bag of pills. It's a lot better than the alternative. The real 
kidney brings you up to almost a normal level." 
</P>
<P>
He takes medication six times a day. He carries a small alarm to remind him 
when to take another dose. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he occasionally gets tired when returning to his Anaheim home from work. 
But, he said, "anybody else who's almost 50 years old gets tired after work." 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway's energy level and quick recovery are common among transplant 
patients, Breckenridge said. "Any transplant patient will have a tremendous 
willingness to go out and do things, to spend time with their family, to work, 
to live." 
</P>
<P>
His recovery has been "very, very excellent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway has been told to avoid such heavy physical activity as contact sports. 
And he can only putt around easily on his four-wheel off-road motorcycle -- no 
more jumps and jolts in the desert. But that's a small price to pay for what he 
has now, Ridgeway said. 
</P>
<P>
And now he can enjoy eating almost anything. "Everything looks and tastes so 
good," Ridgeway said. "I never enjoyed food so much." 
</P>

SAN CLEMENTE, DISTRICT ARE AT ODDS OVER MISSING WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where did all the water go? 
</P>
<P>
That's what San Clemente Utilities Director Greg Morehead wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures compiled by Morehead, the Tri-Cities Municipal Water 
District's reservoir inexplicably continued to decline during the water 
shortage earlier this summer even as San Clemente residents were voluntarily 
conserving millions of gallons. 
</P>
<P>
So, at a district board meeting this week, Morehead raised the question, only 
to have water officials in turn question his figures. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials said that Morehead was wrong and that no water was missing. 
Tri-Cities board member James Lawson accused Morehead of "trying to point a 
finger at some other user." Lawson said that San Clemente is Tri-Cities' 
biggest user and that any conservation in the city would be reflected in 
overall water availability. 
</P>
<P>
Morehead, however, said that Tri-Cities' reservoir readings show that its water 
level continued to dip precariously in August even as San Clemente's utility 
meters were showing sharp cutbacks in water use by residents. 
</P>
<P>
Morehead said the August water "mystery" has current relevance. He said San 
Clemente city government cannot plan for emergency water rationing in the 
future if "there is incomplete information" about where available water is 
being consumed. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente's City Council last month deferred action on a proposed 
water-rationing law, saying that an emergency situation no longer existed. The 
Tri-Cities board, at its Wednesday meeting, criticized the council for not 
acting on that water-rationing measure and said it is still needed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tri-Cities, San Clemente accounts for two-thirds of the district's 
water consumption. The other users served by the water district, which is 
managed by an independently elected board of directors, are Capistrano Beach 
(now a part of Dana Point), the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and San 
Onofre State Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Your figures would defy the laws of physics," Lawson told Morehead at the 
meeting. Lawson said that if San Clemente conserved as much water as Morehead 
contended, the conservation would be felt by Tri-Cities. 
</P>
<P>
Morehead, however, said: "I don't believe you have sufficient data. You don't 
know what the other users are using on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Woodside, general manager of the water district, conceded that the district 
did not have daily consumption figures from the other three users. But Woodside 
said he believed that overall consumption during the water shortage remained 
about the same, with San Clemente still accounting for two-thirds of the usage. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson said, "I think it's pretty clear, Mr. Morehead, that you're suggesting 
that San Clemente is not responsible for the drop in the reservoir" during the 
July-August water shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Morehead responded, "I'm saying that if San Clemente residents decrease water 
use by 500,000 gallons, then that 500,000 gallons ought to show up in the 
(Tri-Cities) reservoir." He added that the city cutbacks and reservoir levels 
showed no such correlation. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Erdman, president of the water board, said after the meeting that the 
discrepancy might be explained by intermediate water-holding areas used by San 
Clemente. Erdman said San Clemente has its own water-holding areas, and that 
these, like the Tri-Cities reservoir, decreased during the water shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the city's water-holding places probably increased during the water 
conservation, and the increase would be reflected there while not necessarily 
at our reservoir," Erdman said.

REPORT REJECTS GRAND JURY VIEW ON COUNTY LAWYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A county report released Thursday disagrees with the Orange County Grand Jury 
that former county attorneys had to wait a year before they could be rehired as 
private legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The report, however, agrees with the grand jury that stricter controls and 
monitoring of county contracts with outside law firms is needed. 
</P>
<P>
But the report, prepared by the County Administrative Office, stopped short of 
endorsing a grand jury proposal to prohibit all "open-ended" contracts with 
private firms hired by the county. The structure of a contract should be 
determined on a case-by-case basis, not a blanket policy, says the county 
report, which will be submitted for approval Tuesday to the County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988-89 grand jury in late May issued a report critical of the county's use 
of private law firms. Among its complaints was the county's practice of hiring 
attorneys who had recently left the county counsel's office. By doing so, the 
grand jury concluded, the county showed favoritism toward certain attorneys or 
firms. To prevent the appearance of a conflict of interest, the grand jury 
recommended that county attorneys who leave for private practice not be rehired 
for at least a year, except with special approval by the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the grand jury also charged that the county counsel's office 
had failed to adequately review millions of dollars in billings from private 
lawyers hired by the county and had not keep track of their hours or caseloads. 
</P>
<P>
In its response released Thursday, the county said there has only been one case 
in recent years when a former county attorney was hired soon after he had left. 
And that hiring, the county contended, was justified because of the attorney's 
expertise in a specific area. 
</P>
<P>
The county report also denies that accounting procedures are lacking when it 
comes to contracts with private firms, adding that an "audit trail" does exist 
to monitor billings and payments.

ONCE BOUND FOR HOLLYWOOD, IDENTICAL TWINS WARREN, WESTON JOHNSON NOW SHARE THE 
SPOTLIGHT ON AND OFF THE FOOTBALL FIELD AT CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Wendy Johnson hadn't grown tired of driving her twin sons to Hollywood 
several times a week for auditions and screen tests years ago, Warren and 
Weston Johnson might have become the rage among hunk-happy teeny-boppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren and Weston at the beach! Warren and Weston at the movies! Warren and 
Weston eating ice cream! The poster possibilities would have been endless. 
</P>
<P>
As it happened, the Johnson twins, made famous -- among friends and relatives 
at least -- through appearances in music videos, hamburger commercials and on 
cereal boxes, turned their talents to sports. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, the Warren and Weston Show has been a hit at Corona 
del Mar High School, be it the football field, basketball or volleyball courts. 
</P>
<P>
Now seniors, the 17-year-old identical twins are hoping for the best football 
seasons of their lives. If they can top last season, their accomplishments will 
be impressive. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 season, the wide receivers/defensive backs each had six 
interceptions during the regular season. Weston also had five in the playoffs, 
helping the Sea Kings to the Division VI championship and their first 
undefeated season, 12-0-2, in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
On offense, where both backed up seniors, Warren had 28 receptions for 330 
yards (a 11.8-yard average) and Weston had 14 for 312 (22-yard average). 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar Coach Dave Holland, who has 30 years of coaching experience, 15 
at Corona del Mar, calls the Johnsons "among the five top athletes I've ever 
coached." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, they will try to help Corona del Mar extend the longest undefeated 
streak -- 14 games -- in Orange County when the Sea Kings take on Huntington 
Beach at Huntington Beach. In last year's game, it was Warren's second-half 
touchdown catch that gave Corona del Mar a 7-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from their jersey numbers -- Warren wears 45, Weston has 44 -- most say 
there are few differences between the brothers on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, both have great pursuit and strong instincts. Offensively, Holland 
said, "They know how to get open and they just steal the ball away from the DBs 
(defensive backs)." 
</P>
<P>
Off the field, there are very few differences between the brothers, too. Wendy 
Johnson had such a tough time discerning the two when they were babies that she 
painted one of Weston's big toes with shiny clear nail polish. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a Newport Beach coffee shop, their similarities -- in voice, 
mannerisms and enthusiasm -- are intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
Both have sandy blond hair -- though Warren says his is definitely less puffed 
up than his brother's -- and Warren's face is a bit narrower. 
</P>
<P>
"Just remember, I'm the bigger one," said Warren, who spent extra time in the 
weight room during the summer to bulk his 6-foot-2 frame to 193 pounds. Weston, 
also 6-2, weighs 185. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also the older one," said Weston, who had a two-minute jump on Warren into 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
But the most obvious difference is the barely visible scar across Weston's 
nose, the result of an accident with a glass magazine rack at age 1 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there are any other differences, the twins become quiet, before Warren 
turns to his brother and gives him an encouraging look. 
</P>
<P>
Said Warren: "Weston, you gotta say it." 
</P>
<P>
Weston: "OK. OK. . . . I have a mole." 
</P>
<P>
Warren: "On his butt." 
</P>
<P>
Weston: "It's a beauty mark." 
</P>
<P>
Warren: "It's a mole." 
</P>
<P>
Weston: "So what? The girls love it." 
</P>
<P>
They burst into laughter, egging each other on as only brothers know how to do. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see why these boys once were sought by Hollywood agents. 
</P>
<P>
The cereal box came first, although not intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first nine years of their lives, Warren and Weston grew up next 
door to Hunter and Graham Pierce, another set of twins. They foursome became 
best friends. When the Pierces went to do a photo shoot for Kellogg's Corn 
Flakes, the Johnsons, then 3, tagged along. 
</P>
<P>
During the shoot, Graham Pierce was unable to hold the cereal bowl the way the 
director wanted. He spilled the milk and started to cry. When he wouldn't stop, 
the director saw Warren and Weston and the rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
Next came a commercial for a fast-food hamburger restaurant, a series of 
commercials for the American Dental Association and an appearance by Warren as 
"Baby John" in the made-for-television movie "Eleanor and Franklin." 
</P>
<P>
(For the record, Weston says he got the part but because he had an encounter 
with a smoldering campfire pit days before the production, he had to turn the 
part over to his brother.) 
</P>
<P>
But the highlight of their stardom, both agree, was their appearance in an 
Olivia Newton John music video, "Physical," which aired in a 1984 television 
special. 
</P>
<P>
"We stood there and looked weird, basically," Warren said. The earnings from 
the video provided them the funds for luxury sports car that they share. 
</P>
<P>
The question everyone asks -- Have they ever switched places in school? -- 
brings a smirk to their faces. 
</P>
<P>
As freshmen they did it twice, once on Halloween and again on April Fool's Day. 
The April Fools episode ended this way: Weston was pleased to tell Warren that 
he aced a surprise science quiz for his brother. Warren, who had acted up in 
class, got Weston a detention. 
</P>
<P>
They say they haven't tried since. 
</P>
<P>
Their concentration now, as it is every fall, is on the football field. Three 
weeks into the season last year, Warren, who had three interceptions by that 
time, came down with mononucleosis. When Holland couldn't decide on a 
replacement, Wendy Johnson charged in with some motherly advice. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'Hey, Weston can do anything Warren can do," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
He took her advice and gave Weston his first start, against Santiago. Weston 
answered with three interceptions, including two he returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
His goal this season is to have at least 10 interceptions. Warren said he wants 
one interception per game. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, the Warren and Weston Show ought to be a blockbuster.

GARDEN GROVE STAYS CALM, STOPS LOSING STREAK AT 19 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Garden Grove High School stopped its 19-game losing streak Thursday night with 
a 17-12 victory over Savanna, but not without a nervous moment or two at Glover 
Stadium in the season-opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
The streak, which had been the longest current one in Orange County, seemed 
sure to end as Garden Grove led, 17-0, with 10:04 left in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
But Savanna rallied for two late touchdowns. Leon Landry scored on a seven-yard 
run with 3:15 left. Savanna cut it to 17-12 when Landry scored on a 50-yard 
punt return with 1:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels recovered the ensuing on-side kick at the Garden Grove 40 with 1:18 
left. After an incomplete pass, Garden Grove's Tim Silva intercepted a pass at 
his own 21 to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The scene of a last-minute Savanna rally was all too familiar to Garden Grove 
and second-year coach Jeff Buenafe. In last season's first game, Savanna scored 
on a long pass on the final play to win, 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to have dreams and nightmares of last season's game in the final 
minute," Buenafe said. "I had visions of that Hail Mary pass all over. We've 
had that streak on our backs from two years. It's good to be done with it." 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove's last victory prior to Thursday, was over Savanna in the 1987 
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Garden Grove had taken a 6-0 lead on a two-yard run by Alex Ripley 
midway in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Argonauts missed two other scoring chances in the first half because of 
penalties. Receiver Joe Squyres caught a 26-yard pass that appeared to be a 
touchdown but was ruled out of bounds at the 10-yard line and come back before 
catching the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove reached the Savanna four-yard line early in the second quarter, 
but a series of penalties stopped the drive. Garden Grove was called for 14 
penalties for 128 yards. Savanna was hardly better, getting 11 flags for 100 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Squyres caught a 34-yard touchdown pass in the with 1:08 left in the third 
quarter. Guy Uesegi added a 32-yard field goal with 10:04 left in the fourth 
quarter and Garden Grove built a 17-0 lead and hung on from there. 
</P>
<P>
Ripley, a junior, led all rushers with 106 yards in 29 carries. Garden Grove 
quarterback Bob Ioja was six of 12 for 81 yards with an interception and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Kenison PoChing led Savanna with 55 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon 10, Corona 7 -- Canyon broke a 17-game winless streak and a 12-game 
losing streak by defeating host Corona. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 7-3, Canyon drove 63 yards on nine plays -- with the help of a face 
mask penalty and Marcus Mitchell's 19-yard run -- and scored on Fred Velez' 
six-yard run with two minutes, 15 seconds left in the game. Canyon was able to 
hold on. 
</P>
<P>
Velez had 87 yards on 19 carries to lead all rushers. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon scored first on a 28-yard field goal by Chris Snitko with 45 seconds 
left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Corona scored on a 39-yard pass from Steve Bernier to Mike Shockley.

GRAGNANO, NO. 1 LOS AL THROW MARINA FOR LOSS

It didn't take long for Los Alamitos High School quarterback Todd Gragnano to 
get his left arm loose Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play from scrimmage in the Griffins' season opener against Marina 
at Gahr High, Gragnano threw to wide receiver Chad Milan for a 55-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen passes later, Gragnano had amassed a total of 280 yards passing and 
three touchdowns to lead Los Alamitos to a 42-22 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The loss extended Marina's losing streak to 16 games, dating to the 1987 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano, a senior, threw touchdown passes of seven and 21 yards to Milan, and 
83 yards to Tyler Cashman. He also ran 35 yards for another score. 
</P>
<P>
It was a night of big plays for Los Alamitos, the top-ranked team in Orange 
County. Erik Mitchell, a transfer running back from Mayfair, returned a kickoff 
90 yards for a touchdown. He was not quite as impressive as a running back, 
gaining only 29 yards in 13 carries. But on this night it didn't matter. 
Gragnano provided enough offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a lot wrong, but we did a lot right," Gragnano said. "Last year I 
started slow, but this was a little different." 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins, tied 28-28 by Kennedy in last season's opener, moved swiftly in 
the first quarter. Gragnano threw a seven-yard scoring pass to Milan, who had 
six catches for 132 yards, on the third play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
On the next series, Gragnano scrambled away from Marina pressure, broke into 
the clear and raced 35 yards for a score. 
</P>
<P>
Marina then scored on a three-yard run by fullback Todd Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
But Mitchell took the ensuing kickoff and returned it 90 yards for a score and 
Marina was never in contention after that. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose if the offense had played the whole game they would have looked 
better," said John Barnes, Los Alamitos coach, who subbed freely beginning in 
the third quarter. "We threw it and caught it well." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and quarterback David Schultz were bright spots for Marina. Lewis rushed 
for a game-high 143 yards in 22 carries. Schultz completed 12 of 24 passes for 
132 yards and a touchdown. He also ran one yard for a fourth-quarter score.

EL TORO ROLLS OVER EL DORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Toro High School had El Dorado's number early, and the lucky number was 
seven -- the number of fumbles El Dorado committed and the number of touchdowns 
the Chargers scored en route to a 49-2 rout in front of 1,500 at Mission Viejo 
High School Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
In the season opener for both teams, El Toro scored all its touchdowns in the 
first half. It was clear from the opening drive that El Dorado was outclassed. 
It took El Toro only four plays and less than two minutes to score on a 51-yard 
pass from Steve Stenstrom to Rob Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
On its first possession, El Dorado gained four yards before being forced to 
punt. 
</P>
<P>
That the score was not more lopsided is a tribute to Charger Coach Bob Johnson, 
who: 
</P>
<P>
A. Wanted to welcome El Dorado's first-year coach, Rick Jones, gently. 
</P>
<P>
B. Wanted to play all 53 of his players. 
</P>
<P>
C. Is not the type to run up the score. 
</P>
<P>
D. Took pity on the Golden Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
E. All of the above. 
</P>
<P>
"When a team's beat, they're beat," Johnson said. Johnson went three deep into 
his quarterbacks and kept the ball on the ground most of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom completed four of five passes for 87 yards and two touchdowns, both 
to Johnson. He also carried twice for 31 yards. With the score 28-0 after one 
quarter, he was replaced by Johnson, who completed four of four passes for 33 
yards and two touchdowns in one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
He then gave way to Brad Milby, who completed three passes for 28 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very deep at quarterback," Johnson said. "We've got the best quarterback 
in the (South Coast) league and the second-best quarterback in the league." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks made slight progress in the second half, when backup 
quarterback Jason Bluth went against El Toro's reserves. Bluth completed one of 
two passes for 16 yards and carried five times for 36 yards.

Curtis R. Olson, a partner and half-owner of Newport Beach's Nexus USA Equities 
-- one of the county's largest developers and real estate investors -- has 
split from the firm to pursue "other personal and business interests." Scott T. 
Burnham, Olson's partner and owner of the other half of Nexus, is forming a new 
company, Burnham USA Equities. Burnham has essentially the same personnel as 
Nexus, minus Olson. It will continue to manage such Nexus projects as the 
$100-million Nexus City Square office and store project in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Also splitting from his old company is David E. Sigmond -- a partner at SDC 
Development Co. in Newport Beach -- who is starting a new outfit called the 
Sigmond Co. in Costa Mesa. The new firm will develop, manage and invest in 
commercial buildings. While at SDC, Sigmond developed the McKinley Freeway 
Showroom in Corona, a group of furniture stores visible from the freeway.

The largest undeveloped site zoned for commercial use in Yorba Linda is for 
sale for $17 million. Sperry Van Ness, a Newport Beach broker, has the right to 
sell the 32-acre parcel. 
</P>

Meanwhile, also in Yorba Linda, construction is under way on a small shopping 
center called Galleria de Yorba, developed by Orange's Corinthian Development 
Co. The 15,000-square-foot center is expected to open in the fall with an El 
Pollo Loco restaurant and a florist among the tenants. About half the space has 
already been leased.

Hillman Properties, Newport Beach, is expanding into southern Orange County. 
The developer and investor bought 13 acres in Baker Ranch, a 700-acre business 
park near the huge Irvine Spectrum business park at the junction of the San 
Diego and Santa Ana freeways. The developer has already begun construction of 
20 buildings on the eight-acre Vista Terrace Business Park property, bought for 
$3.1 million. Hillman will also build four concrete industrial buildings on its 
five-acre Foothill Business Park, bought for $2.4 million. Both are expected to 
open in April. 
</P>
<P>
And another developer, Hopkins Development Co. in Newport Beach, has some new 
business in Riverside. Hopkins said it obtained exclusive rights to negotiate 
the redevelopment of a block in that city. Named Orangetree Plaza, the block -- 
near Riverside's historic district -- will get 74 apartments and condos, plus 
offices and stores. It is the first redevelopment project in Riverside to 
provide housing units, Hopkins says.

FORD AEROSPACE-LED TEAM TO MODERNIZE NASA CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A multicompany team led by Ford Aerospace Corp., a Newport Beach-based defense 
contractor, has been awarded a $500-million contract to modernize the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Mission Control Center in Houston and 
build a new control center for the proposed U.S. space station project. 
</P>
<P>
And in an unrelated move, Ford Aerospace said it recently sent layoff notices 
to 60 salaried workers at its Aeronutronics division in Newport Beach. The 
local division makes the Sidewinder and Chaparral missiles as well as 
electro-optical systems and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
The employees, mostly engineers and administrative staff, will be laid off in 
October, said Susan Pearce, a Ford Aerospace spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
In total, Ford Aerospace employs 2,700 people at Aeronutronics. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford Motor Co. subsidiary said the 10-year contract should generate about 
$300 million in revenue for the company during that period. About 40% of the 
contract's revenue -- $200 million -- will go to subcontractors including 
International Business Machines, Unisys, and Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton, Ford 
Aerospace officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an extremely important contract to us," Pearce said. "It enables us to 
maintain a significant presence in . . . major NASA programs of the future." 
</P>
<P>
The contract comes at an opportune time for Ford Aerospace, which has seen its 
business decline as a result of cuts in the federal defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace said the contract will be managed by its 600-employee division 
in Houston, where the company will add 150 workers. There will be no jobs added 
in Orange County, Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Ford Aerospace will give a complete face lift to NASA's 
computerized control facility used in manned flights at the Johnson Space 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace built the original NASA control center in 1963 and has been the 
prime contractor on several upgrades since then. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace will also build a control center for the space station, a 
$25-billion project that is being designed for assembly in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs, announced separately, are the result of "a general decline in the 
division's overall business volume," Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at a decline in defense budgets, and we're taking measures to 
reorganize and do some things more cost-effectively." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ford Aerospace said it has recalled all 300 employees who 
were temporarily laid off in May while the company conducted a review of its 
quality-control systems. 
</P>
<P>
That review was prompted by the Defense Department's concerns about the 
company's quality control on three weapons programs at the Newport Beach 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Those weapons programs involved the Sidewinder and Chaparral missiles and a 
target-designation system for the FA-18 fighter jet.

SHARPENED POGUES BAND TO OPEN FOR BOB DYLAN IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a bitter New England night early in 1986 and the Pogues, on their first 
visit to the United States, were just trying to keep things toasty in their own 
way. 
</P>
<P>
For those in the audience, the immediate issue wasn't whether this band and its 
innovative fusion of punk and Irish folk music could stand the test of time. 
The question at hand was whether the Pogues could last the night. 
</P>
<P>
They did -- just barely. The show ended with the Pogues singing an old Irish 
tune, leaning on each other for support. Not musical support, physical support. 
But for those mutual shoulders, this unsurpassably inebriated performance 
surely would have ended with most of the band falling down drunk on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the Pogues -- who open tonight for Bob Dylan at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre -- are standing quite well on their musical merits. Their current 
album, "Peace and Love," is the varied, accomplished work of a band that has 
steadily broadened its range and sharpened its ability without losing its 
penchant for going off on a rowdy, wild-eyed jag. 
</P>
<P>
The one Pogue not standing, as of early this week, was Shane MacGowan, the 
band's primary singer and songwriter. Spider Stacy, the tin whistle player who 
helped MacGowan start the Pogues, said that MacGowan fell ill as he was about 
to fly from London to California for the band's tour with Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
"He got sick at the airport. It became apparent there was no way he was going 
to be able to make it at this time," MacGowan said Wednesday in a phone 
interview from San Diego. "We'll just press on and hope he gets better and 
makes it out here. What we've heard from England is that he's resting for a 
couple of days. He's had tests done, and he should be out here in two or three 
days." 
</P>
<P>
The Pogues can't help but miss MacGowan, whose singing and songwriting wed 
affecting poetry with comically boozy bluster in a distinctively Irish way. But 
with "Peace and Love," the Pogues show that they have other creative resources 
as well. Of the 14 songs on the album, MacGowan wrote only six. 
</P>
<P>
"He just hadn't written as many songs for this one as he had done for the 
others," Stacy explained. "Partly, I expect, because there was less need for 
him to do so because they were coming from other people in the band." 
</P>
<P>
In spreading the songwriting around, the Pogues haven't sacrificed quality. 
MacGowan's contributions include such strong numbers as "Cotton Fields," a 
driving tune based upon American chain-gang work songs; the humorous "Boat 
Train," one of many Pogues songs about drinking bouts, and "London You're a 
Lady," a gruffly sentimental portrait of the band's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
But songs such as "Lorelei," a sweeping folk-rock epic by guitarist Philip 
Chevron, and "Tombstone," multi-instrumentalist Jem Finer's darkly atmospheric 
portrayal of the aftermath of nuclear or environmental disaster, hold up nicely 
and expand the Pogues' possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Stacy said, the Pogues had performed only once without MacGowan. The 
gap-toothed singer came down with pneumonia two hours before a show in Sweden a 
few years ago and the rest of the band carried on after girding itself at the 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a complete mess because our attitude was 'what the hell.' We were quite 
a shambles that night," Stacy recalled. "We got totally looped before we went 
on stage. It was one of those nights. It all seemed to have its own logic. And 
the audience didn't mind." 
</P>
<P>
With or without MacGowan, Stacy said, the Pogues' early image as lovable 
on-stage inebriates no longer applies and hasn't in some time. 
</P>
<P>
"That image, we're not entirely blameless for that," he acknowledged. "But it's 
something we weren't trying to project. We were just being ourselves. When we 
started, the gig tended to be a part of the night out for us as much as 
everybody else. Spilling our drinks all over ourselves, playing a few songs 
very ineptly and then staggering back to the bar again -- that was true on some 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
"But the image of us as drunken musicians was something created by the press. 
They picked up on one aspect of the band. But I think it became apparent to 
anyone with sense that there was a lot more to us than that. We were a band 
that was literally learning as we went along -- from scratch in a lot of cases. 
People could see us tightening up and getting stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Stacy, 30, was not a musician when the Pogues started out in 1982. But, even 
though he is not of Irish extraction (in fact, only half the Pogues have Irish 
backgrounds), he was taken with the idea of combining the punk rock spirit with 
the spirit of Irish folk music. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a whole area of music that had been neglected and ridiculed more often 
than not. It was an opportunity to do something really different. Irish music 
can be, at its best, something heartbreakingly beautiful and it can really get 
your blood boiling." 
</P>

ANAHEIM PHOTOGRAPHER EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF LIGHT SOURCES TO CREATE 
OFTEN-HAUNTING COLOR IMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, Times Staff WriterRobert Lachman is a staff photographer 
with The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Hesketh's photographs can give you a very eerie feeling. 
</P>
<P>
By day, the 34-year-old Anaheim resident puts together audio-visual slide shows 
for conservative Orange County businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But by night, he creates strikingly bizarre color images, using light sources 
that range from fluorescent fixtures and late-model television tubes to 
camp-store flashlights and open fires. 
</P>
<P>
Using a 1950s Speed Graphic press camera mounted securely on a bulky tripod, he 
leaves the shutter open for time exposures of more than an hour as he walks in 
and out of the area framed by the lens, using his various light sources to 
illuminate -- or "paint" -- various props. 
</P>
<P>
The different kinds of light leave different imprints, or "strokes" (he uses a 
laser light to do fine detail work). He varies the colors by using different 
filters. 
</P>
<P>
The props themselves tend to be simple things: an old ladder, a white picket 
fence, a rusty blue chair. But the 16-by-20-inch prints that result can be 
unsettling. One of the most graphic shows a face (actually one of Hesketh's 
neighbors) in a deathly pose, partially covered by a white cloth, "emerging" 
from a dark green pool table. 
</P>
<P>
"The images come off more threatening than they really are," Hesketh insists. 
"When you get close to them, they start to soften up. You can start identifying 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
(He also said he has found that people gain more appreciation for the work once 
they realize that the images weren't created in a darkroom, but right in front 
of the camera.) 
</P>
<P>
Still, he continues, "I'm really surprised by how people are affected by them. 
Or what people bring to the pieces. They bring a lot of their own experiences 
to them. In fact, they will actually interpret things into them that I have 
never thought of." 
</P>
<P>
Not that hidden meanings are never intended. 
</P>
<P>
"Ascension," one of several works on view at the Cypress College Photo Gallery 
through Sept. 15, is a ghostly image of a wheelchair with an empty pair of red 
shoes and a series of feet making their way to a ladder. A shadowy figure lurks 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Ascension' came out of an inspiration where I had the passing of an aunt who 
was basically like my grandmother," Hesketh said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had stored her wheelchair away at my home. In one of those moments of trying 
to figure out things to do, I pulled out the wheelchair and ladder." 
</P>
<P>
He already had done some preliminary work involving the idea of feet going up a 
ladder and had come to think of it in terms of death and ascension. 
</P>
<P>
"People see the wheelchair (in the finished work) and say they have relatives 
who are wheelchair-bound and that's the only way they are going to walk through 
this passage of death." 
</P>
<P>
Another ghostly image at Cypress is "Self Portrait," a simple chair that, when 
starkly lit from above, takes on the appearance of an electric chair. Hesketh 
used his light source to "paint" his arms and feet into the image. 
</P>
<P>
Hesketh's work is not without humor, however. He takes pokes at suburbia with 
such pieces as "A Visit With the In-Laws," which shows a patio chair, a 
barbecue and two old-model television sets, and "Anxious Flamingo," a view of a 
bright pink flamingo poised in front of a white picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
Still, let the viewer beware. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dangerous Images," a collection of photographs by John Hesketh, remains on 
view through next Friday at the Cypress College Photo Gallery, Technical 
Education I Building, 9200 Valley View St., Cypress. Hours: 8 a.m to noon 
Friday, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday. Admission: free. 
Information: (714) 826-2220, Ext. 244. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven new works by Hesketh will be included in the "Outside Influences," an 
exhibit opening Thursday at the John Thomas Gallery, 602 Colorado Ave., Santa 
Monica, and continuing through Oct. 28. Hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesdays 
through Saturdays. Admission: free. Information: (213) 396-6096.

'THE FATAL WEAKNESS' IN STANTON ACTUALLY HAS MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At his best, as with the small classic "The Show-Off" (1924), George Kelly was 
a pungent satirist who knew how to wrap plots all around human foibles and 
folly. 
</P>
<P>
But his strongest work, such as "Craig's Wife" and "Daisy Mayme," came during 
the early part of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Later on, Kelly's comedies often took on a harsh humor, even betraying a 
certain misanthropy that often divorced his audience from the business at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fatal Weakness," now at the Stanton Community Theatre under John Craig's 
direction, first was produced at the end of Kelly's career, in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
While it is not as abrasive as some of his plays, it's still a weak comedy -- 
talky, predictable and generally too silly for its own good. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of "The Show-Off's" seltzerish spontaneity and characterizations, 
"Fatal Weakness" offers an overworked story line based on infidelity among the 
upper class and a handful of boobish folks that can't keep us interested for 
long. 
</P>
<P>
The balmiest has to be Mrs. Paul Espenshade (Bettie Muellenberg), a woman so 
obsessed with romance that she scans the newspapers for wedding announcements, 
then makes an appearance, weeping all the while. Her "weakness" is so 
pronounced that she even gets dewy when thinking about her husband's (Bob 
Ijames) affair with an attractive orthopedic surgeon. That isn't romantic, it's 
stupid. 
</P>
<P>
Well, she does get angry every once in a while, but most of the indignation is 
left to her bitchy pal, Mabel (Lorraine MacWilliams), a society shrew who has 
nothing better to do than chart the dissolution of relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Mabel really enjoys all the heartache. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly uses her for laughs -- Mabel has most of the tart lines -- but she is not 
a very likable character. 
</P>
<P>
The acting at Stanton tends toward a curt, high-society tone that is meant to 
pass for authentic but too often registers as contrived. Just about everybody 
has a vocal edge that apparently is supposed to evoke a self-interested, 
out-of-the-mainstream air that comes from being wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, MacWilliams does generate a few sparks as Mabel as she exploits the 
situation for her own amusement. 
</P>
<P>
And Muellenberg, in the thankless role as Mrs. Espenshade, is occasionally 
funny when she drifts into her foolish reveries. 
</P>
<P>
'FATAL WEAKNESS' 
</P>
<P>

John Craig. With Bettie Muellenberg, Donna Turner, Lorraine MacWilliams,

UNESCO has declared today International Literacy Day to focus on the worldwide 
problem of illiteracy. Orange County ranks seventh in the nation in the number 
of immigrants it receives each year, according to the Center for Immigration 
Studies in Washington D.C., and among them are many who do not speak English 
and lack skills in their native language as well. It is also estimated that one 
in five people in Orange County do not have the necessary reading, writing and 
comprehension skills necessary for employment advancement.

NORTHERN FLICKER 
</P>
<P>
(Colaptes auratus) 
</P>
<P>
Description: This member of the woodpecker family has a brown barred back and 
spotted underparts with a black crescent bib; white rump is conspicuous in 
flight. Males have a red mustache-like stripe. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Common in open woodlands and suburban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Primarily gleans insects from tree trunk and branches; also occasionally 
gleans ants from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Display: Courtship displays are noisy and active, with calling, drumming, wing 
and tail flashing, billing and bobbing while pair 
</P>
<P>
face each other. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Builds nest in variety of cavities, especially trees but also posts, 
poles, houses, banks and boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: White and unmarked, 1.1 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: Of the woodpeckers, the northern flicker is the most 
likely to stray from nesting areas after the breeding season, and can be seen 
in winter throughout the county, sometimes in family groups. The form seen in 
Orange County is the red-shafted; the gilded form, found in the Southwest, and 
the yellow-shafted, found east of the Rockies, are rarely spotted in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or 
to get information on the breeding bird atlas (now in its fifth and final 
year), call Sea and Sage Audubon Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714) 
962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714) 786-3160.

ANN CONWAY: GALAS TO TOAST KIDS' CAUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just try to stay away from this one. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's only billionaire, Donald L. Bren, is the gala's honorary 
chairman. It has a seven-figure budget. Its food will be served up by Orange 
County's hottest caterer, Thymes Special Event Group of Newport Beach. Les 
Brown and his Band of Renown will entertain, as will a slew of ultra-hot, new 
musical ensembles such as High Society and the Palm Springs Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
And, oh, the romance. They're calling it "Moonlight Over the Mediterranean," 
and if Newport Center Fashion Island has its way, the alfresco gala that will 
celebrate its $100-million expansion on Oct. 25 will have 3,500 guests feeling 
like they've hit lunar heaven. 
</P>
<P>
Set for a Wednesday (midweek splashes are becoming a trend -- everyone seems to 
be nervous about competing with the stacks of parties that crowd weekends), the 
gala will benefit six local children's support programs: Childhelp USA, the 
Irvine Children's Fund, the Irvine Theatre Children's Programs, the Mardan 
Center, the Orange County Bar Foundation Inc.'s Shortstop and the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society's Youth Programs. 
</P>
<P>
Why a benefit for kids? "They're our future," says Bridget Lehman, director of 
special events for Newport Center. "If we take good care of them, maybe they 
will take good care of us." 
</P>
<P>
While the gala unfolds on the new Mediterranean-esque paseos of Newport Center, 
a party for children will be staged in another area. But the two gatherings 
will converge during the evening's finale: the children will participate in a 
procession of light and present thank-you notes to guests. (Proceeds from the 
$75 per-person event, which will be totally underwritten by the Irvine Co., are 
expected to pencil out at a whopping $250,000.) 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the grand reopening festivities that launch Orange County's 
shop-till-you-drop destination near the bay begin on Oct. 23 with an event 
organizers are calling a "Tour and Travel Dine Around." Now, to get invited to 
this free splash, you have to belong to the travel industry and live locally or 
in San Diego, Palm Springs or Los Angeles. About 500 guests will get to sample 
goodies from five of the center's trendy bistros -- El Torito, Five Feet Too, 
Farmer's Market, California Pizza Kitchen and Tutto Mare. "Every half hour, 
guests will rotate to another restaurant with strolling musicians leading the 
way," Lehman says. 
</P>
<P>
The next night, the center will stage a "Business Community Mixer" with food 
and beverages provided by Thymes, owned by Janet Rosener of Newport Beach. 
Fifteen hundred local movers and shakers will attend this party. 
</P>
<P>
Now, of course you're wondering who gets to go to the gala the following night. 
The good news? Anybody can buy a ticket, Lehman says. "They just need to call 
us at Newport Center." 
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, the mailing list includes the support groups of the gala 
beneficiaries as well as local VIPs. But the twist, says Lehman, is that this 
is not an "elitist party" (something, some say, is the only kind of bash tossed 
in ritzy Newport Beach). "Everybody is invited." 
</P>
<P>
More good news: With the advent of its expanded outdoor areas, Newport Center 
will become available as a site for local charity soirees. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that can put a damper on the outdoor gala is rain. "We don't 
even want to say that four-letter word," Lehman says, laughing. "But we'll have 
a tent on standby, just in case." 
</P>
<P>
Delightfully spooked! The poor phantom of the opera -- singing like mad for 
months without a full day of play. Well, Michael Crawford, currently thrilling 
thousands at the Los Angeles Music Center in the title role of Andrew Lloyd 
Webber's musical, "The Phantom of the Opera," decided to do something about it. 
He got on the phone and called Sassy Luby of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Luby met Crawford a few months ago when she'd gone backstage in New York after 
seeing "Phantom." The Newport Beach socialite gave him her phone number, 
telling him to call if he wanted a tour when he came to California. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Luby -- formerly married to Roger Luby -- didn't think she stood a 
ghost of a chance. But the phone call came last Saturday. Crawford told Luby 
that he was tired, dying to take a fun-filled day off. So, Luby called her 
buddies Dick and Joan Stevens of Bel Air and Barbara and Terry O'Neill of 
Newport Beach and set out with Crawford for a Newport Bay cruise and picnic 
aboard the Queen Joan, a cocktail cruiser belonging to the Stevenses. 
</P>
<P>
Well, there were lots of chandelier jokes until everybody loosened up 
(chandeliers fill the stage area when the "phantom" cruises the "lake" under 
the Paris Opera house in the musical). Then it was smooth sailing all the way.

DISABLED LEARN TO LIVE ON THEIR OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is just after 1 p.m. and most of the nearly 300 workers in the 
warehouse-like room are back from lunch and beginning to raise the level of 
activity to a bright hum. 
</P>
<P>
At tables and workbenches around the room, electrical components are being 
packaged, posters and artwork are being heat-sealed, envelopes are being 
stuffed and large potato chip cans are being labeled. The work moves along 
steadily and efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
They are simple jobs, but the workers, and the process that brought them there, 
are anything but. 
</P>
<P>
The people manning the tables at the California Elwyn Institute are nearly all 
developmentally disabled, suffering from neurological conditions and other 
disabilities that elsewhere might mean a life of dependency where such everyday 
acts as riding a bus or ordering lunch at a counter would never be learned. 
Many of them previously have been confined to hospitals, board-and-care homes 
or other facilities where a sense of independence may not have flourished. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Elwyn Institute, located in an industrial section of Fountain Valley 
hard by the San Diego Freeway (there is a second, smaller facility in Anaheim), 
self-sufficiency -- learning the simple skills to function both socially and 
economically in the world -- is the goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Their goals are the same as anyone else's," said Joan McKinney, the assistant 
executive director of the institute. "We place some pretty high expectations on 
our people, and because of that, they start to expect more of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Elwyn has been providing that sort of inspiration for more than a century. 
Since its beginnings in Pennsylvania in 1852 (the Orange County facility has 
been operating since 1974), Elwyn has been a private vocational training school 
where the mentally retarded and other developmentally disabled people are 
trained to help themselves. At both Elwyn facilities in Orange County, 
"clients" who may not know how to count, read or fathom a bus schedule are 
taught how to use these and other skills to become more fully independent. 
</P>
<P>
At the Fountain Valley facility, about 75% of the 400 clients work at the 
facility itself, assembling, collating, preparing bulk mailing, 
shrink-wrapping, labeling and packaging. 
</P>
<P>
Simple aids are used for those who have trouble counting or distinguishing 
shapes: small cardboard sections painted with spaces indicating the number and 
shape of electronic parts to be placed in plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
In one section of the room, special programs are tailored to meet the needs of 
those with multiple disabilities -- clients who may be both mentally retarded 
and blind, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
And there is a lunchroom area, the scene of many successes. 
</P>
<P>
Many clients, McKinney said, have had no experience with purchasing their own 
meals and often are initially bewildered by the concept of receiving food in 
return for money. She told of one client who initially "was taking food from 
trash cans or stealing it. If he wanted a cup of coffee, he just took it, even 
if it belonged to someone else. Now he purchases his own food." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Piccari, executive director of the center, recalled a day when he was 
working in the lunchroom and accepted a client's money, saying "Thank you, 
sir." 
</P>
<P>
"And he looked at me and said, 'I'm not a sir,' " Piccari said. "He wasn't used 
to being treated as an adult. When you treat them as adults, it begins creating 
a level of adult expectation." 
</P>
<P>
Episodes like that are victories, McKinney said. 
</P>
<P>
"To some people," she said, "things like this would appear to be very minor, 
but they're not. They're big accomplishments." 
</P>
<P>
Clients are paid according to their abilities, said Susan DuMontier, a 
spokeswoman for Elwyn. Their pay is based on the percentage of work they can 
perform based on the amount of work an average person can do in an hour. For 
example, if an average person can package 50 circuit testers in an hour at the 
minimum hourly wage of $4.25, clients are paid $4.25 for every 50 testers they 
package. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal at the Elwyn Institute, however, is to see a client walk out 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole trend now is to de-institutionalization," DuMontier said. "Our goal 
is to place them in jobs out in the community. And employers have found out 
that they do make good employees. They're a newly tapped resource for a lot of 
employers." 
</P>
<P>
Piccari said about 25 clients are placed in outside jobs each year. About 100 
of Elwyn's clients are now in the Orange County work force, DuMontier said. 
</P>
<P>
One of them is Don MacKenney, 42, who for the last two years has worked as a 
technician at the Dover Shores Pet Care Center in Costa Mesa, a short walk from 
his residence in a board-and-care home. 
</P>
<P>
"He comes in on time, every weekday at 7 in the morning," said Scott Hamtil, 
the center's manager. "You don't have to worry about him. He's our anchor man. 
He feeds and waters the animals, keeps the cages clean, walks the dogs. Each 
animal is kind of like a personal friend to him." 
</P>
<P>
As for MacKenney, he considers his pay of $4.25 an hour "good money." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always running around everywhere here, keeping things clean," he said. "I 
like it. I do my job as well as anyone can do." 
</P>
<P>
Which, DuMontier said, is an attitude that indicates yet another victory. 
</P>
<P>
"When they become more independent," she said, "they feel so much better about 
themselves. It might appear that their IQs have gone up, but it's just their 
attitude. They act differently. These people have come a long way from being 
called imbeciles."

STYLE: FOR SANTA ANA PERFUME CREATOR, INDIVIDUALITY IS OF THE ESSENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN NEWELL YOUNG, Karen Newell Young is a regular contributor to Orange 
County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anne Pliska and her perfume are a lot alike. They're both assertive, feminine 
and pink. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular day, the 30-year-old Santa Ana resident and creator of the 
pink-colored Anne Pliska fragrance collection is wearing a hot-pink blazer, 
hot-pink lipstick and hot-pink high heels as she scrambles madly to meet a 
production deadline. 
</P>
<P>
But five years ago, when she decided to break into the fashion industry by 
launching a fragrance, she had no idea how to peddle her product or handle a 
deadline scramble. 
</P>
<P>
"I literally went through the phone book and called a perfumer," she says from 
her Irvine industrial park headquarters. "I didn't know anything about the 
industry. Fortunately I had called a world-renowned company and the creator of 
(Calvin Klein's) Obsession, but I didn't know any of that at the time." 
</P>
<P>
What she did know was that she wanted a classy scent that would be both 
extremely feminine and distinctive. So she decided to market a fragrance in her 
favorite color. 
</P>
<P>
The company she chose to create the scent -- Roure-Bertrand-Dupont, which has 
offices in France, New Jersey and Woodland Hills and has created such 
fragrances as Bijan, Sophia, Obsession and Poison -- put together some samples 
that filled Pliska's request for a classic, feminine fragrance different from 
any other on the market. 
</P>
<P>
After two years of smelling samples, Pliska chose the slightly Oriental 
fragrance of fruit and spice essences that she sells under her name (pronounced 
anay to rhyme with Renee) to Nordstrom, Harris' in San Bernardino, The Jones 
Store in Kansas City, Dayton Hudson in Detroit and other outlets across the 
country. (The Ritz-Carlton resort in Dana Point and Nordstrom stores are the 
only places to purchase the perfume in Orange County.) 
</P>
<P>
As a girl growing up in Newport Beach, Pliska had long dreamed of becoming a 
fashion designer. But after a couple of years designing women's clothing and 
accessories, she found that she was just as poor and obscure as before she 
started. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't pay the bills," she says. "So I thought I should get a real job. I 
tried the corporate world and found . . . I was not corporate-minded. I 
realized I was not a political animal. After being fired from my last corporate 
job, I thought maybe I'd better go back to designing," she adds, her pink lips 
forming a huge smile. 
</P>
<P>
But designing what? 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of like, where do you start eating the elephant? The fashion world 
is huge, and I wasn't sure where to start. But I thought with fragrance, that 
it would get me a name faster." 
</P>
<P>
She was right. Once she launched the fragrance, large department stores began 
requesting huge orders. (The orders are filled in Irvine, after the scent 
mixture is sent from Roure-Bertrand-Dupont to other labs, where it is mixed 
with alcohol and made into gels, body lotion and other products.) 
</P>
<P>
But it took nearly two years of product development before the perfume hit the 
market -- settling on the scent, devising the marketing plan and designing the 
packaging. Choosing the fragrance, she says, took the most time. 
</P>
<P>
Most perfumes and colognes are created by fragrance companies, which a designer 
or cosmetics firm contacts when ready to market a new product. Once a scent is 
created, the designer usually signs a contract with the fragrance company, 
which agrees to supply a certain amount of scent mixture for a certain price. 
The mixture, which is sold by the pound, is sent to labs where it is made into 
the products you see in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
In Pliska's case, she has an exclusive contract with the Roure-Bertrand-Dupont 
company and its assurance that a similar scent will not be created for another 
designer. There are no copyrights or patents on fragrances, says Annette Green 
of the Fragrance Foundation in New York. 
</P>
<P>
For any given scent, perhaps two dozen trial fragrances will be compiled by 
perfumers in a fragrance company's laboratories, explains Ron Benton, regional 
vice president of fragrance sales for Roure-Bertrand-Dupont, which, according 
to the Fragrance Foundation is among the world's top producers of fine scents. 
</P>
<P>
Into these samples will go between 100 and 150 ingredients, elements that will 
be continuously fine-tuned until the final product is selected, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like writing out a recipe," he says. "It might read 2% jasmine, or 3% 
sandalwood, and all the ingredients that go into a single perfume are 
compounded in the lab and presented to the customer." 
</P>
<P>
The scent might take years to develop and more years to market. But despite the 
investment in time and resources, Benton says that the average life span for 
perfume is five years and that only a few survive to join the ranks of such 
classic scents as Chanel No. 5 (created in 1924) and White Shoulders (born in 
1939). 
</P>
<P>
Pliska is determined to nurture one of the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really striving to become a classic," she says. "I think quietly and 
surely, I'm developing a steady, loyal following. . . . I don't intend to be a 
mass-market fragrance fad." 
</P>
<P>
Her research shows that the Anne Pliska customer is a woman 25 years or older 
who is not into trends. "It's someone who wants a scent that speaks of 
individuality," she says. "American women are beginning to turn away from the 
European and even the Madison Avenue ideals of glamour and are beginning to 
celebrate their own individuality." 
</P>
<P>
After settling on the fragrance and the color, Pliska chose luxurious white and 
gold packages to promote an upscale, exclusive image for the line of eight 
fragrance products, which start at $25 for bath gel and go to $80 for a 
half-ounce of perfume. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Nordstrom came knocking. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I hadn't planned to sell to Nordstrom or any other store," says 
Pliska. "My plan was to sell through a catalogue, and perhaps create a demand 
by being unavailable. But I went to the Nordstrom perfume buyer (at South Coast 
Plaza) just to talk about strategy and pricing, and they wanted to buy it right 
then. Nordstrom likes things they know you can't buy elsewhere, that have an 
exclusive quality." 
</P>
<P>
Since then (Anne Pliska fragrances first appeared at Nordstrom on Valentine's 
Day, 1987), it's been a mad dash to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beaten me to death," says Pliska with a laugh. A newlywed whose husband 
handles many of the company's finances, she says despite the travel and reputed 
glamour of the fragrance industry, she is too busy to be having fun with it. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband ("I'm married but may not be for long if business keeps 
up") just moved from Newport Beach to a 1926 house in northern Santa Ana, but 
she hasn't had much time to settle in. 
</P>
<P>
"I know, it seems everybody else is moving in the other direction, from Santa 
Ana to Newport Beach, but I went the other way." 
</P>
<P>
The same could be said of her professional life. 
</P>
<P>
"It does seem I've always run against the crowd," she says.

SUSPECTED CAR THIEF KILLED DURING CHASE BY POLICE IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected car thief being pursued by police died when he rammed a stolen car 
into a 10-ton asphalt roller at a construction site in Irvine, police said this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who remains unidentified pending notification of relatives, was 
fleeing police at speeds up to 80 m.p.h. in a short chase that began on the 
southbound San Diego Freeway about 11 p.m., said Irvine Police Sgt. Phil Povey. 
The driver had stolen a 1987 Hyundai sedan from Costa Mesa when the chase 
began, Povey said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose age and hometown were unknown this morning, left the freeway at 
Culver Drive. He turned westbound on Campus Drive. With two police cars in 
pursuit, the man tried to pass two cars in front of him but ran into an asphalt 
roller in a lane that had been closed for construction. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the man was killed instantly.

PLACENTIA OFFICER IS SHOT; ASSAILANT DIES IN GUNFIGHT;

A police officer in Placentia was shot and wounded outside a bar by a woman's 
outraged boyfriend who was later chased down by police and killed in a gun 
battle, authorities said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old officer, whose name was being withheld, was in stable condition 
at Western Medical Center in Santa Ana after three hours of surgery for a wound 
in the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Half-Hour Standoff 
</P>
<P>
Police said the Buena Park man suspected of shooting the officer late Thursday 
night was killed after a half-hour standoff with about a dozen officers from 
the Placentia and Anaheim police forces in a vacant lot at Van Buren Street and 
Orangethorpe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jay Fricke, a Placentia police spokesman, said the man, who also was not 
identified pending notification of his relatives, was killed by officers after 
he fired shots at them shortly before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure how many shots were fired off at the second shoot-out," Fricke 
said. "One officer estimated at least two gunshots were fired by the suspect" 
before officers responded. 
</P>
<P>
Fricke said the episode began at about 11:15 p.m. when the officer was called 
by a woman at the Railroad Inn, 1228 E. Orangethorpe Ave., who was concerned 
because her boyfriend had threatened her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Veteran of 5 Years 
</P>
<P>
When the officer, a veteran of five years of police work, confronted the 
boyfriend, the man shot him and fled in his car, authorities said. Another 
officer arrived just as the assailant drove away, and was told by his 
still-conscious colleague to pursue the man, Fricke said. 
</P>
<P>
After a short car chase, the man crashed into a railroad crossing bar about a 
mile away, then took cover behind his car as police closed in, Fricke said. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff lasted about a half-hour, Fricke said, until the man shot at 
officers who had taken position around the suspect, and police returned fire 
and killed him, Fricke said.

Former President Ronald Reagan will undergo surgery this weekend to remove 
fluid on his brain that apparently resulted from his horseback riding accident 
two months ago, a spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The fluid was found during a routine exam at the Mayo Clinic, said Mark 
Weinberg, a spokesman for the 78-year-old former President. 
</P>
<P>
"President Reagan was found to have a small collection of fluid on top of the 
right side of his brain," Weinberg said. "Physicians believe this is a direct 
result of President Reagan being thrown by a wild horse in July in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Although President Reagan has not experienced any symptoms, physicians have 
advised this fluid be removed in a routine procedure which will be performed at 
St. Marys Hospital, a Mayo Foundation hospital, this weekend," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that Reagan's treatment is being managed by Mayo Clinic physicians, 
who said that he is otherwise in excellent health. Reagan's wife, Nancy, who 
also underwent routine tests, was found to be in excellent health, Weinberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The pair arrived in Minnesota from Bel-Air on Wednesday and checked into the 
clinic Thursday. They left the clinic this morning.

'PRIESTESS' GUILTY OF PROSTITUTION

<TEXT>
<P>
A Canyon Country woman who claims to be a priestess of an ancient Egyptian 
religion was convicted today of two misdemeanor counts of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
After 3 1/2 days of deliberations, the six-man, six-woman Municipal Court jury 
returned the guilty verdict against Mary Ellen Tracy, 46, also known as Sabrina 
Aset, high priestess of the Church of the Most High Goddess. The jury also 
convicted her husband, Wilbur, 51, of one count of operating a house of 
prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had contended that under the tenets of their religion, sex was used 
as a purification ritual and that Mary Ellen Tracy had to have sex with 
thousands of men to attain her standing as a high priestess. But the jury 
apparently decided the Tracy's West Los Angeles two-story, Spanish-style 
"church," complete with an office, living room and four bedrooms, was a thinly 
veiled brothel.

'RUMORS' SPARKED EXIT FROM BEIRUT, AOUN'S AIDES SAY

Christian Gen. Michel Aoun and his Cabinet urged the United States today to 
bring back its diplomats, calling their evacuation a misguided reaction to 
rumors they were in danger. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cabinet expresses its regret . . . because the U.S. Administration based 
its decision on illusions, rumors and erroneous information," a statement from 
Aoun's three-man Christian Cabinet said. 
</P>
<P>
It called on the United States to "reconsider the pulling out of its diplomats 
from Lebanon in order to preserve bilateral relations." 
</P>
<P>
The statement marked a partial backing down by Aoun in his war of words with 
Washington, although it was unclear to what extent this might be because it was 
issued by the Cabinet rather than Aoun himself. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun's Cabinet is one of two vying for power in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Aoun said U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy would be welcomed 
back only if he presented his credentials to the Christian Cabinet and 
recognized it as the legitimate government. 
</P>
<P>
That demand was not reiterated in the new statement. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy arrived in Lebanon a year ago and did not present his credentials in 
an obvious effort to avoid recognizing either the Christian or Muslim 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Cabinet's statement was issued after a two-hour meeting at the 
bunker under the bomb-ravaged presidential palace in suburban Baabda east of 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
A reliable Christian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Aoun 
considers the U.S. evacuation "a move directed against his rule." 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats were evacuated Wednesday a few hours after pro-Aoun Christian 
youths besieged the embassy compound in Beirut's northern suburb of Aukar. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Syrian-backed Muslim Cabinet 
vying for power with Aoun's, expressed "regret" over the pullout. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the evacuation was 
motivated by what she called a threat by Aoun to take Americans hostage. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Sept. 1 in the French daily Figaro, Aoun was asked 
whether the United States was putting pressure on France not to aid him. 
</P>
<P>
He replied: "They put pressure on everyone and claim in addition to have so 
acted because they have . . . hostages being held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"As if the war were being waged without hostages or victims. If I understand 
well, it would be enough that tomorrow I take 20 Americans hostage so that the 
United States stops putting pressure on my friends."

MARILYN MONROE LETTER NETS $7,150

<P>
A handwritten letter by Marilyn Monroe was sold for $7,150, setting a record 
for an auction price for a letter by a movie star, according to a specialist in 
autograph auctions. 
</P>
<P>
The auction Thursday night broke the old record of $6,600 paid in September, 
1987, for a handwritten letter by actress Greta Garbo, said Herman Darvick, who 
stages autograph auctions six times a year. 
</P>
<P>
The record does not include one movie actor -- the one who became President. A 
handwritten letter by Ronald Reagan praising Frank Sinatra once sold for 
$12,500, but his White House connection made a large difference, Darvick said. 
</P>
<P>
The Monroe letter, in an envelope postmarked Jan. 17, 1945, is actually signed 
Norma Jeane, Monroe's given name. She was 18 when she wrote it.

Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has written to Pope John Paul II to express 
his interest in meeting the pontiff for a full review of Vatican-Soviet 
relations, a Vatican official said today. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Soviet sources said Gorbachev is expected to visit Italy on Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting between Gorbachev and the Polish-born Pope has been viewed as likely 
during the Soviet leader's stop in Italy, but there had been no confirmation by 
either side. 
</P>
<P>
Such a meeting would be of historic proportions, the first between the head of 
a Soviet Communist Party that disparages religion and the leader of the world's 
850 million Roman Catholics.

The wife of missing Briton Jack Mann, a World War II fighter pilot, said today 
she had been told he died and that she believed the report to be true. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, 75, disappeared May 12 as he drove to a bank in Syrian-policed Muslim 
West Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
None of Lebanon's kidnap groups has specifically identified him as a hostage. 
But a previously unknown faction, the Cells of Armed Struggle, claimed that it 
kidnaped an unidentified Briton in Beirut the day Mann disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
It demanded the release of Arabs jailed in Britain for the 1987 killing of 
Palestinian cartoonist Ali Naji al-Adhami. But Scotland Yard said no arrests 
had been made in that slaying. 
</P>
<P>
There had been no word since then about Mann's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Sunny, said she received a telephone call Monday from an unidentified 
man who told her: "I have bad news about your husband." 
</P>
<P>
She said she later met the man at a shop in West Beirut's Hamra commercial 
thoroughfare and "he told me that Jack is dead." 
</P>
<P>
"I waited, but there was no news about Jack on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday," 
Mann told reporters at her West Beirut apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. There's no proof that he's dead at the moment," she said. But 
she noted that the report of her husband's alleged death "seems correct." 
</P>
<P>
The Manns lived in Beirut for 43 years. He worked as a pilot with Lebanon's 
national airline, Middle East Airlines, for more than 20 years before retiring 
to manage a bar in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of 16 Westerners missing in Lebanon. Most are held hostage by 
pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim militants. The other Westerners are eight Americans, 
three Britons, two West Germans, an Italian and an Irishman.

Mark Burgund told the court that Bakker wanted a Mercedes for his wife, Tammy 
Faye, because her Cadillac had been wrecked in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
"When the car was brought out, Tammy didn't like the way it looked, so Jim said 
he would take the car and to bring another out for Tammy," Burgund said. A 
Mercedes station wagon was subsequently purchased to transport the Bakker

four Arabs in one of the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths raised to 110 the number of Palestinians killed by fellow Arabs 
since the start nearly 21 months ago of the uprising against Israeli 
occupation. Most have been accused of collaboration. The slayings came despite 
an appeal in a leaflet distributed by the uprising's leadership calling on 
Palestinian activists to not be too quick to kill alleged collaborators.

U.S. and South Korean negotiators reached tentative agreement early today on a 
North Pacific fishing treaty, heading off a confrontation that could have led 
to a ban on South Korean fishery products. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans and fisheries, said the 
agreement will be initialed after both sides review the final text. Before it 
could go into force, both nations will have to sign it formally. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, U.S. enforcement officers will have "unrestricted 
authority" to board and inspect Korean drift net vessels to search for evidence 
of illegal fishing and all Korean drift net vessels will have to be equipped 
with satellite transponders by the 1990 fishing season, Wolfe said.

EASTERN PILOT UNION OUSTS LEADER ON EVE OF NEW NEGOTIATIONS

Eastern's pilots union said today it has ousted its leader, a month after he 
suggested ending their strike and on the eve of new talks with management. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern pilots Chairman Jack Bavis was removed in a vote by 17 members of the 
union's executive council, according to a taped telephone message on the 
pilots' information line late Thursday. The union council members reflected 
recent rank-and-file sentiment against Bavis. 
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to take steps at times that are difficult," Raymond (Buzz) 
Wright, interim union chairman, told the pilots. "They are in the best 
interests of the pilots." 
</P>
<P>
With the strike in its seventh month, the pilots are "looking for a leader who 
reflects the strength, resolve and tenacity of the rank and file," union 
spokesman Hank Weber said today. "Our leadership is now reflecting the desires 
of the rank and file." 
</P>
<P>
Bavis, an Eastern pilot since 1966 and official for years with the Air Line 
Pilots Assn., became the Eastern pilots union leader in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Weber said that Bavis conceivably could be returned to the leadership and that 
a vote will be taken at a future meeting to select a permanent chairman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiations Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, union and management officials said they have scheduled negotiations 
for Monday, their first talks in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots requested the talks before the National Mediation Board in June, and 
the airline made a similar request in July. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Mogus of the Eastern pilots' executive council said that the talks in 
Washington, D.C., will probably end in an impasse and that Eastern will ask the 
National Mediation Board to call for a 30-day cooling-off period, after which 
Eastern could impose its own conditions on pilots who have crossed the picket 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
But Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Thursday: "We look at this as an 
opportunity to resolve our differences with the pilots' union." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of pilots crossed picket lines in the week after an Aug. 6 meeting in 
which Bavis called for consideration of ending the strike. Most union members 
angrily rejected the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
The union joined Eastern's Machinists and flight attendants in a strike that 
began March 4.

The National Assn. of Manufacturers called on the Bush Administration today to 
waive a legal obstacle blocking the Soviet Union from gaining 
most-favored-nation status in a bid to promote greater trade between the two 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union is likely to be a much more important market tomorrow than 
today and American manufacturers want to be an important player in that 
market," Jerry Jasinowski, executive vice president of NAM, told business and 
government officials at a trade forum sponsored by the association. 
</P>
<P>
A major stumbling block to the Soviet Union acquiring most-favored status is an 
amendment to the 1974 Trade Act. Among the conditions of the Jackson-Vanik 
amendment is that nations allow the free emigration of citizens, a provision 
targeted at the emigration policies concerning Soviet Jews, association members 
said.

Driving rain hampered the opening day in the World Cup track and field meet, 
with David Patrick of the United States splashing down the homestretch to win 
the men's 400-meter hurdles. He was timed in 48.74 seconds. 
</P>

GIOIOSA LINKS ROSE TO SECOND PIK SIX WINNER

<P>
Thomas Gioiosa today implicated Pete Rose in another race track gambling scheme 
during his drug and tax-evasion trial, giving federal prosecutors more evidence 
in their investigation of the former Cincinnati Reds manager. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination, Gioiosa said that he had cashed a second Pik Six 
ticket for Rose and claimed all the winnings on his taxes. Rose now has been 
linked to two Pik Six payoffs during Gioiosa's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Rose is under investigation by a federal grand jury in Cincinnati looking into 
whether he hid income from gambling, memorabilia sales and autograph 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Gioiosa, who lived with Rose from 1979 to 1984, had refused to discuss his 
gambling associations with Rose before his trial in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
However, he told to a 12-member jury today that he cashed a winning $6,351 Pik 
Six ticket from Turfway Park in northern Kentucky for Rose in December, 1986. 
Gioiosa later reported the full amount on his taxes, even though he said he 
gave the money to Rose and got back only a part of the winnings. 
</P>
<P>
A Pik Six pays off when a bettor correctly chooses the winner of six 
consecutive races. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Kathleen Brinkman asked Gioiosa who won the $6,356 Pik 
Six. 
</P>
<P>
"I was with Pete Rose. I went down and cashed it and gave him the money," 
Gioiosa said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Rose then gave him a share of the winnings, but he wasn't sure how 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't count it," Gioiosa said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked who bought the ticket, Gioiosa said, "I don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
Gioiosa, 31, of New Bedford, Mass., is on trial on charges of conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine and tax evasion. Gioiosa could be sentenced to up to 38 
years in jail and fined $2 million if found guilty on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
One of the tax evasion charges involves another Pik Six ticket from Turfway 
Park -- this one a $47,646 payoff that Gioiosa claimed on his taxes but the 
government contends actually belonged to Rose.

Former University of Tennessee quarterback Tony Robinson, who also was a 
replacement player for the Washington Redskins during the NFL players' strike 
in 1987, was arrested on a fugitive warrant for parole violation by Fairfax 
County, Va., police. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was taken into custody on Thursday on a warrant issued by authorities 
in Knox County, Tenn. He had recently joined the Virginia Storm of the Minor 
League Football System. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest was the second time he had been picked up for parole violations 
following his release from the Knox County penal farm in 1987 after being found 
guilty on cocaine distribution charges. Robinson was sentenced to six years in 
prison on cocaine charges in 1986, but served only 90 days of that term. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested last May and charged with using cocaine and marijuana, and 
changing residences and jobs without permission. He was being held on $25,000 
bond.

The English Football Assn. voted today to cancel a trip by the national soccer 
team to the Netherlands in December because of a fear of hooliganism. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came a day after the British government asked the association to 
call off the match and two days after English hooliganism re-emerged during a 
World Cup match in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
The association said members of its executive committee, who were canvassed by 
telephone, voted unanimously to call off the exhibition match set for Dec. 13 
in Rotterdam. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Colin Moynihan sent a letter to the association Thursday 
seeking cancellation of the match "in the interests of the future of English 
football and of the country as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 English fans were arrested Wednesday night for vandalism and 
rampaging through central Stockholm before the World Cup qualifying match 
against Sweden.

RAMS WAIT -- IMPATIENTLY -- WHILE STRICKLAND AND HAWKINS LEARN THE ROPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A rookie's nightmare, as remembered by linebacker Fred Strickland, Class of 
'88: 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing San Francisco the first time last year," he said. "I was 
playing in the nickel coverage and I lined up on the wrong side. That was the 
game that Roger Craig had, like, his best game of the season. It was the one 
where he made that long run, the one that made all the highlight films. I was 
supposed to be on the other side on that play. (Safety) Michael Stewart was 
trying to tell me to move over, but I was concentrating so hard on what was 
going on that I didn't really hear him." 
</P>
<P>
Too bad, as Craig took the handoff that day, dashed around the left end (where 
Strickland would have been had he not botched his assignment), cut back toward 
the middle, broke about a half dozen tackles and then staggered into the Ram 
end zone. It was a memorable 46-yard touchdown run, one that Strickland won't 
forget. Ever. 
</P>
<P>
"My worst moment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jogging back to the sidelines that afternoon, Strickland didn't know he had 
erred. Then he saw the defensive coaches waiting for him. Then he got a phone 
call from the other defensive coaches stationed in the press box. And a day 
later, in the team's regular Monday meetings, Strickland had to sit quietly as 
the game film was played over and over. And every time it showed Strickland 
glued to the wrong spot as Craig, the human highlight, began his 46-yard 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
A rookie's education, as told by defensive tackle Bill Hawkins, Class of '89: 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing you realize is that everybody is good here," he said. "It's 
going to take some time." 
</P>
<P>
Time isn't something Hawkins, the Rams' No. 1 draft choice this spring, has in 
great supply. A contract dispute and subsequent holdout delayed his training 
camp arrival until mid-August. Now, as the season fast approaches, Hawkins 
finds himself in an accelerated learning program. 
</P>
<P>
He played in his first exhibition game only a few days after coming to camp. 
The mistakes followed soon thereafter. He said he was nervous, excited, anxious 
-- all the feelings you have when you enter unchartered territory. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good to get back into it," he said, "but I've still got a long way to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Strickland and Hawkins are separated by a season's worth of experiences, but, 
at the same time, tied to a single purpose. They are the next wave of 
replacement parts, dual cornerstones of a Ram defense that relies heavily on 
its inside linebackers and interior linemen. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland went through his apprenticeship last season and, at 6-foot-2, 250 
pounds, he etched a place in the memories of Ram coaches rather early. John 
Robinson couldn't believe his good fortune, that is, finding someone built like 
Strickland still available late in the second round of the draft. Better yet, 
Strickland's play mirrored his build: powerful, intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
In one of those draft day quirks, where everyone over-analyzes, Strickland went 
untouched through the first round and well into the second. The Rams, who had 
three picks that round, took receiver/defensive back Anthony Newman, then 
receiver Willie Anderson, then, still sitting there, Strickland. They still pat 
themselves on the back for that one. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an inside-outside guy who had played for a couple of different coaching 
staffs (at Purdue)," defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said. "He had moved 
around a lot and as a result, wasn't real productive as a college player. But 
our scouting people were aware of his potential. He was picked pretty much on 
athletic ability and projected to play a specific position -- inside linebacker 
-- in our defense. As it turns out, he had spent enough time as an inside guy 
and an outside guy that those multiple skills really helped him. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, he's a big-play kind of guy. He had a big impact." 
</P>
<P>
Strickland spent much of last season asking linebacker Carl Ekern (since 
retired) to tutor him on the nuances of the Ram defenses. When Ekern was busy, 
linebacker Kevin Greene and defensive tackle Shawn Miller took turns quizzing 
Strickland on various formations. 
</P>
<P>
Something clicked. Strickland found himself spending more time in games and 
less time on the sidelines. And if he bumbled an assignment, well, it happens. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember not knowing the defenses that well and just playing on 
ability," he said. "Now I know the defenses well enough that I can help other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Strickland's progress came in measured doses. He began to notice fewer mistakes 
when reviewing the game film. The coaches weren't always waiting for him on the 
sidelines. His teammates started to compliment him on his performances. This 
was an evolution of skills. 
</P>
<P>
As you might expect, veterans generally aren't crazy about rookies. Rookies 
tend to make rookie mistakes, which means the veterans have to overcompensate, 
which means their own play can suffer. Strickland went through it last year. 
Hawkins goes through it this year. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as (the veterans) think you know what you're doing, that makes it a 
lot easier for them," Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, Strickland's breakthrough game probably came against 
those same 49ers, two months later in the regular-season finale. The Rams 
needed a victory at Candlestick Park to ensure themselves a place in the 
playoffs. There could be no 46-yard runs from Craig that night. 
</P>
<P>
There weren't. The Rams defeated the 49ers, 38-16, partly because of 
Strickland, who tied for the team lead in tackles and added two sacks. And he 
didn't even need Stewart for instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Shurmur can't wait to welcome him back to the lineup. As soon as 
Strickland's right knee is up to it (he underwent arthroscopic surgery Aug. 8), 
Shurmur wants to try all sorts of schemes and rushes. At last check, Strickland 
was scheduled to be used in the highly successful Eagle defense, in 
third-and-long situations, in the regular defense at inside linebacker. In 
short, he'll be busy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind playing anywhere, as long as I get to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Same goes for Hawkins, who has been used initially as an inside pass rusher. 
That will change as the season goes on and Hawkins, as Strickland did last 
year, has his role expanded. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to blow smoke, but maybe if I would have had a full camp, maybe 
things would have been different," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Translation: He wouldn't be feeling his way around the game right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we recognize that he has a lot of talent and we also recognize that he 
needs a lot of work," Shurmur said. "The fact that he has great talent is a 
start, but it's only a start." 
</P>
<P>
You were expecting a ringing endorsement? 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins said he understands the process of fitting into a new system. At the 
University of Miami, Hawkins and the rest of the Hurricane defenders were told 
to play "like a scalded ape," he said. Here, there are more responsibilities, 
more subtleties. It requires a transition period. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just looking to contribute right now as best as I can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So are the Rams. Just as they did with Strickland. It's a rite of the rookies.

<P>
A LOOK AT THE RAMS' 1989 OPPONENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA FALCONS 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 10, 10 a.m., Fulton County Stadium 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 8, 1 p.m., Anaheim Stadium 
</P>
<P>
1988 record: 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
Series record: Rams lead series, 32-10-2. 
</P>
<P>
Key offensive starter: A tossup between quarterback Chris Miller and running 
back John Settle. Miller is a superior athlete who brought an extra dimension 
to a dismal passing offense last year. Now if he can only stay healthy. 
Meanwhile, the Falcons traded Pro Bowl rusher Gerald Riggs to the Washington 
Redskins, leaving Settle as the primary running threat. As gambles go, this 
wasn't much of one. Settle rushed for 1,024 yards last year. 
</P>
<P>
Key defensive starter: First-round draft choice Neon Deion Sanders, a defensive 
back, got all the off-season headlines, but linebacker Aundray Bruce will 
finish the year with the most accolades. Bruce finished the year with five 
sacks and two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could do without seeing . . . the greening of a Falcon team that 
features lots of young, potentially terrific players. Think of the 
possibilities should Sanders, wide receiver Shawn Collins, Miller, Bruce, 
running back Kenny Flowers and linebacker Marcus Cotton blossom this season. 
</P>
<P>
INDIANAPOLIS COLTS 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 17, 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Stadium 
</P>
<P>
1988 record: 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
Series record: Colts lead series, 20-15-2. 
</P>
<P>
Key offensive starter: Could it be anyone but The Goggled One, running back 
Eric Dickerson? Dickerson churned out another 1,000 yard-plus season (1,659 to 
be exact) and 14 rushing touchdowns. He also caught 36 passes, which tends to 
keep defensive coordinators a bit more honest when scheming to stop Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
Key defensive starter: Linebacker Duane Bickett, who has emerged quietly as one 
of the American Football Conference's most consistent defensive players. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could do without seeing . . . Dickerson dashing up and down the field 
Sept. 17. Dickerson thrives on this sort of situation: lots of pressure, 
national attention. Nothing would give him more pleasure than sticking it to 
his former team, especially Coach John Robinson and vice president John Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
GREEN BAY PACKERS 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 24, 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Stadium 
</P>
<P>
1988 record: 4-12. 
</P>
<P>
Series record: Rams lead series, 40-33-2. 
</P>
<P>
Key offensive starter: Wide receiver Sterling Sharpe caught 55 passes last 
year, no small feat considering that the Packers haven't had a decent 
quarterback since Lynn Dickey called it quits a few years ago. But Sharpe will 
have to do something about his catch-to-touchdown ratio, which was an 
unbelievable 55-1. Then again, the Packers will have to do something about 
their quarterback situation. 
</P>
<P>
Key defensive starter: Little-known linebacker Tim Harris, who led the Packers 
in both tackles and sacks last year. Expect to see Harris in the Pro Bowl soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could do without seeing . . . mammoth offensive tackle Tony Mandarich 
taking his place on the Packer line. Mandarich would instantly improve an 
anemic running game, to say nothing of the pass protection he would provide. 
</P>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 1, 1 p.m., Candlestick Park 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 11, 6 p.m., Anaheim Stadium 
</P>
<P>
1988 record: 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
Series record: Rams lead series, 46-30-2. 
</P>
<P>
Key offensive starter: Where do you start with this team? Quarterback Joe 
Montana is still the heart and soul of the 49ers. He threw 18 touchdown passes 
last year and added another three via the run. Running back Roger Craig emerged 
as the National Football Conference's dominant runner in a season that saw him 
gain a remarkable 1,502 yards. Add to that Craig's 76 receptions and you have 
the game's most complete back. And then there's receiver Jerry Rice, who merely 
averaged 20.4 yards every time he caught one of his 64 passes. 
</P>
<P>
Key defensive starter: Change that to starters. Nose tackle Michael Carter is 
the best in the business at clogging the middle of offensive lines. Safety 
Ronnie Lott has few, if any, peers among NFL defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could do without seeing . . . Montana dropping into the pocket. The 
man just kills the Rams. The same goes for Craig, who scored three times 
against the Rams in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
BUFFALO BILLS 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 16, 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Stadium 
</P>
<P>
1988 record: 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
Series record: Rams lead series, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Key offensive starter: The Bills won 12 games last year despite a sub-par 
season by quarterback Jim Kelly (15 touchdown passes, 17 interceptions). Just 
think if he gets his act together and Coach Marv Levy lets him throw downfield 
on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Key defensive starter: Hard to find a better group of defenders. End Bruce 
Smith and linebacker Cornelius Bennett combined for 20 1/2 sacks in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could do without seeing . . . The Bills giving the ball to Robb 
Riddick on a fourth-and-goal from the 1. Riddick scored 12 touchdowns in 1988, 
many of them on goal-line situations. 
</P>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS SAINTS 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 22, 1 p.m., Anaheim Stadium 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 26, 5 p.m., Superdome 
</P>
<P>
1988 record: 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
Series record: Rams lead series, 25-13. 
</P>
<P>
Key offensive starter: An easy call -- kicker Morten Andersen, who has 
redefined the importance of field-goal accuracy. Andersen missed only a single 
extra point last year and 10 of 36 field goal attempts. He is the closest thing 
to a Pro Bowl lock in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Key defensive starter: Attention has to be given to the Saints' four 
linebackers -- Sam Mills, Vaughn Johnson, Pat Swilling and Rickey Jackson. 
Mills made the Pro Bowl last year, but the honor could have gone to any of the 
four. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could do without seeing. . . . Multipurpose running back Dalton 
Hilliard. Nor are they in any big hurry to see how good running back Craig 
Heyward might be if he can keep his weight down to manageable levels. 
</P>
<P>
CHICAGO BEARS 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 29, 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Soldier Field 
</P>
<P>
1988 record: 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
Series record: Bears lead series, 42-28-3. 
</P>
<P>
Key offensive starter: With Jim McMahon gone, quarterback Mike Tomczak inherits 
the pressure and prestige that comes with leading the Bear attack. If he can 
handle Coach Mike Ditka and the full-time responsibilities, the Bears will 
challenge once again for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Key defensive starter: Why ask? Linebacker Mike Singletary directs a unit that 
was ranked first against the rush and second overall in the league. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could do without seeing . . . the trio of Dan Hampton (9 1/2 sacks), 
Richard Dent (10 1/2 sacks) and Steve McMichael (11 1/2 sacks). 
</P>
<P>
MINNESOTA VIKINGS 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 5, 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Metrodome 
</P>
<P>
1988 record: 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
Series record: Vikings lead series 12-11-2. 
</P>
<P>
Key offensive starter: It didn't much matter if it's Tommy Kramer or Wade 
Wilson throwing the ball, wide receiver Anthony Carter is the big-play player 
on a big-play team. Carter set a team record for reception yards with 1,225 on 
72 catches, and at 5-11, 165-pounds is the patron saint of short guys 
everywhere. The last time the Rams saw Carter, in the NFC Wild Card game won by 
the Vikings last December, he caught four passes for 102 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Key defensive starter: Though the Vikings are great up front -- defensive end 
Chris Doleman, tackle Keith Millard and nose tackle Henry Thomas combined for 
22 sacks -- the killer on this team is in the secondary: Joey Browner. Browner 
is a big hitter in the mold of Ronnie Lott and has a knack for making big 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could do without seeing . . . anyone of their defensive backs turning 
on their heels and madly chasing after Carter. 
</P>
<P>
PHOENIX CARDINALS 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 19, 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Stadium 
</P>
<P>
1988 record: 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
Series record: Rams lead series 21-16-2. 
</P>
<P>
Key offensive starter: Whoever ends up at quarterback. This is a team that 
scored 11 more touchdowns receiving (26) than it did rushing. Receivers J.T. 
Smith and Roy Green each finished third and tenth, respectively, in the NFC in 
receptions. But they need someone to get them the ball. Neil Lomax was the 
NFL's seventh-rated passer last season, but an arthritic hip might have ended 
his career. So find some space in the margin and write Gary Hogeboom/Tom 
Tupa/Timm Rosenbach. 
</P>
<P>
Key defensive starter: Safety Tim McDonald led his team in tackles with a 
whopping 115, almost twice as many as the next in line, defensive end Niko Noga 
with 62. McDonald had two interceptions, two sacks, forced four fumbles and 
blocked an extra point, a punt and a field goal. This is a busy guy. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could do without seeing . . . anyone of the triad of quarterbacks, or 
Lomax himself, getting into a cozy rhythm with Smith and Green. 
</P>
<P>
DALLAS COWBOYS 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 3, 12 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Stadium 
</P>
<P>
1988 record: 3-13. 
</P>
<P>
Record against Rams: Series tied at 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
Key offensive starter: Running back Herschel Walker was second in the NFL in 
rushing, with 1,514 yards, and is the NFL leader over the last two seasons in 
rushing-receiving yards, with 3,625. With a rookie-either Steve Walsh or Troy 
Aikman-almost guarenteed of being the Cowboys' quarterback, it's important for 
this team to have someone to depend on. 
</P>
<P>
Key defensive starter: Is this really applicable? This is a defense that 
allowed an average of 23.8 points per game and ranked 20th in total defense in 
the NFL. The team had only 10 interceptions; Atlanta's Scott Case did that by 
himself. If we must, Bill Bates should be the guy. He led team in tackles with 
124 and was second in special team tackles with 22. A bona fide football 
madman, Bates is a little bit of chaos needed on a defense often found dozing. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could do without seeing . . . wide receiver Michael Irvin about to 
catch the ball with room to run. As a rookie, Irvin averaged 20.4 yards a 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK JETS 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 17, 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Stadium 
</P>
<P>
1988 record: 8-7-1. 
</P>
<P>
Series record: Rams lead series 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Key offensive starter: The Jets can put points on the board-they ranked third 
in the AFC in scoring last season-but half of their games were decided by a 
touchdown or less. It's those situations that demand a good kicker, and the 
Jets have one in Pat Leahy. Leahy made 23 of 28 field goal attempts and all 43 
PATs. He has made 52 of his last 54 field goal attempts inside the 40, and his 
81% accuracy rate over the past four seasons ties him with the Saints' Morton 
Anderson for second behind Kansas City's Nick Lowery (82%). 
</P>
<P>
Key defensive starter: As a rookie last season, safety Erik McMillan led the 
AFC in interceptions (8) though he played in only 13 games. He was also named 
to the Pro Bowl, the first Jet rookie to be selected since Emerson Boozer in 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could do without seeing . . . quarterback Ken O'Brien with plenty of 
time to spot Al Toon, who led the league in receptions with 93. 
</P>
<P>
NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 24, 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan Stadium 
</P>
<P>
1988 record: 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
Series record: Patriots lead series 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Key offensive starter: All running back John Stephens did as a rookie was rush 
for 1,168 yards and get selected to the Pro Bowl as well as be named the NFL's 
Rookie of the Year. How important was Stephens? His rushing yardage was nearly 
three times as much as New England's No. 2 ground gainer, Robert Perryman, who 
ran for 448 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Key defensive starter: Linebackers Johnny Rembert and Andre Tippett are as good 
as any twosome. Rembert had 137 tackles, including 98 solo. Tippett, often 
compared to Lawrence Taylor, missed four games but still had 50 tackles and 
seven sacks. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could do without seeing . . . quarterback Doug Flutie with his hands 
on the ball, late in a close game. Flutie, though his statistics have paled in 
the pros, has always had a knack for winning the close games.

<P>
OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD 
</P>
<P>
RUNNINGS BACKS 
</P>
<P>
GREG BELL 
</P>
<P>
The workhorse in the backfield last year was a contract holdout through most of 
the exhibition season. A five-year pro, Bell rushed for 1,212 yards on 288 
carries last season and led the team in touchdowns with 16. Also caught 24 
passes for 124 yards. Traded to the Rams from Buffalo in 1987 deal that sent 
Eric Dickerson to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
CLEVELAND GARY 
</P>
<P>
When the Rams' made Gary their first-round draft pick last spring, they hoped 
the former University of Miami back would beef up their backfield. They're 
still hoping. Gary has been a contract holdout. 
</P>
<P>
GASTON GREEN 
</P>
<P>
Started for part of exhibition season while Greg Bell was a contract holdout. 
Coming off a disappointing rookie season, where he carried the ball 35 times 
for only 117 yards, a 3.3-yard average. Has shown flashes of brilliance this 
season, rushing for 63 yards in the first half against Minnesota. Has shown 
flashes of mediocrity, fumbling twice in the third quarter against the Vikings. 
Became UCLA's all-time leading rusher and was selected in the first round of 
the 1988 draft by the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
QUARTERBACKS 
</P>
<P>
JIM EVERETT 
</P>
<P>
The four-year pro emerged as one of the Rams' team leaders last year, passing 
for 3,964 yards. He completed 308 of 517 passes (59.6%), threw 31 touchdown 
passes and 18 interceptions. Finished sixth in balloting for the Heisman Trophy 
during his senior season at Purdue, where he led the nation in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
STEVE DILS 
</P>
<P>
A Band-Aid solution as backup quarterback. Two weeks ago, Dils was living the 
peaceful life of retired NFL quarterback, selling commercial real estate in 
Atlanta. But after reserve quarterback Mark Herrmann suffered a rib injury, the 
Rams called Dils, who they cut loose last season. In his first game back, he 
completed his only pass for nine yards in a 24-14 victory over Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
MARK HERRMANN 
</P>
<P>
Fractured a rib on his left side when he was blindsided by Phoenix safety Tim 
McDonald in exhibition game and isn't expected back until the middle of the 
month. Entered training camp as No. 2 quarterback behind fellow Purdue graduate 
Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT DELPINO 
</P>
<P>
Suffered a shoulder injury during exhibition season. Battling for starting 
position in Rams' muddled backfield. A two-year pro from Missouri, Delpino 
started three of 15 games he played in last year, gaining 147 yards on 34 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
BUFORD McGEE 
</P>
<P>
Has a reputation as a fierce blocker. The five-year pro from Mississippi had 
only 16 carries but gained 117 yards. Started 12 of 16 games he played. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
GUARDS 
</P>
<P>
DUVAL LOVE 
</P>
<P>
The former Fountain Valley High School and UCLA star recently ended a contract 
holdout. The five-year pro started all 15 games he played in last year. Started 
three years at UCLA and was twice an All-Pac 10 selection. 
</P>
<P>
TOM NEWBERRY 
</P>
<P>
The three-year pro suffered a hamstring injury in off-season, which forced him 
to miss part of the preseason. Good speed for a lineman. Runs the 40 in 4.68 
seconds. Can bench press 460 pounds and squat 740 pounds. Was taken in the 
second round of the 1986 draft out of Wisconsin-LaCrosse, an NAIA school. 
</P>
<P>
WARREN WHEAT 
</P>
<P>
A neck injury has sidelined the eighth-round draft pick from Brigham Young for 
part of the exhibition season. At 6-foot-6 and 275 pounds, Wheat brings size 
and pass blocking to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TACKLES 
</P>
<P>
JACKIE SLATER 
</P>
<P>
Begins his 14th season and anchors an experienced offensive line with Doug 
Smith (11 seasons) and Irv Pankey (nine years). Was third-round draft choice in 
1976 from Jackson State. 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT COX 
</P>
<P>
A reserve, Cox was a contract holdout for most of the exhibition season. At 
6-foot-5, 285 pounds, he brings size and versatility to the offensive line. Can 
play both tackle and guard. Spent two seasons at UCLA after transferring from 
Chabot Junior College. 
</P>
<P>
IRV PANKEY 
</P>
<P>
Entering his 10th season with the Rams. Adds size and savvy to an experienced 
Rams' line. Started all 16 games last year. The Rams' biggest lineman at 
6-foot-5, 295 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WIDE RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
WILLIE ANDERSON 
</P>
<P>
With Aaron Cox out with a hamstring injury, Anderson is making a serious run at 
the No. 2 receiving spot behind Henry Ellard. Had 14 catches in the exhibition 
season, matching his total of all last year. A threat on deep patterns, 
Anderson averaged 29 yards a catch last season, the best on the team. Nicknamed 
"Flipper," Anderson boasts a 36 1/2-inch vertical jump. 
</P>
<P>
RON BROWN 
</P>
<P>
Gold medalist in 400-meter relay at 1984 Olympics, came out of football 
retirement last year to rejoin the Rams. Playing in seven games, he caught two 
passes for 16 yards. Greatest contribution could come as a kickoff returner, 
however; his four career touchdowns on returns is a Rams record. 
</P>
<P>
AARON COX 
</P>
<P>
Cox, sidelined with a hamstring injury, was battling Willie Anderson for the 
No. 2 wide receiver position behind Henry Ellard. Caught 28 passes for 590 
yards last year, an average of 21.1 yards a catch, second on the team to 
Anderson. Runs the 40 in 4.39 seconds and is considered an excellent route 
runner. Earned All-Pacific 10 honors as a senior at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
HENRY ELLARD 
</P>
<P>
The seven-year pro is coming off his best season, leading the Rams with 86 
catches for 1,414 yards. A big-play threat as both a receiver and punt 
returner. Led the NFL in punt returns his first four seasons, but dropped in 
the last two seasons. Was a standout receiver at Fresno State, where he also 
was a top collegiate triple-jumper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CENTERS 
</P>
<P>
TONY SLATON 
</P>
<P>
An experienced backup for Doug Smith at center. Entering his sixth year as a 
pro. Former USC All-America selection was signed by the Rams in 1984 after 
being waived by Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
DOUG SMITH 
</P>
<P>
During his 11 years in the NFL, Smith has played four positions on the 
offensive line: left guard, center, right guard and right tackle. But it's at 
center where Smith has excelled, earning five consecutive Pro Bowl berths. One 
of the most experienced linemen in the league along with teammate Jackie Slater 
(14 seasons). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TIGHT ENDS 
</P>
<P>
PAT CARTER 
</P>
<P>
Acquired in August from Detroit to try and solve depth problem at tight end. 
Carter, 6-foot-4 and 250 pounds, was seldom used in the Lions' new 
run-and-shoot offense. A three-year starter at Florida State, Carter had a 
difficult rookie year. He caught only 13 passes for 145 yards after suffering a 
back injury while lifting weights before camp. 
</P>
<P>
PETE HOLOHAN 
</P>
<P>
Missed much of the exhibition season with a knee injury, but returned and 
caught a three-yard touchdown pass against Minnesota. Tough on third and 
short-yardage situations. After Rams acquired him in a draft day trade with San 
Diego last year, he caught 59 passes for 656 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
DAMONE JOHNSON 
</P>
<P>
His long, exhibition-season salary holdout, along with Pete Holohan's knee 
injury, left Rams without a tight end for part of the preseason. Caught 42 
passes for 350 yards last year. Attended Santa Monica High School, where he 
played football and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE BACKFIELD 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CORNERBACKS 
</P>
<P>
DARRYL HENLEY 
</P>
<P>
Joins Rams after earning first-team All-America honors at UCLA. Will be counted 
on to return punts, after averaging 12.3 yards per return as a senior. On 
defense, he had seven interceptions in his college career, averaging 18.7 yards 
a return. 
</P>
<P>
CLIFFORD HICKS 
</P>
<P>
A two-year pro, Hicks' main contributions last year were with special teams. 
Returned 25 punts for 144 yards, the most on the team. Played in only seven 
games with two tackles. Played two years at Oregon after transferring from San 
Diego Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
JERRY GRAY 
</P>
<P>
Was second on the team in tackles last year with 63. Also had 13 pass 
deflections and three interceptions. Moved to cornerback after earning 
All-America honors twice as a safety at Texas. 
</P>
<P>
LeROY IRVIN 
</P>
<P>
Currently serving a 30-day suspension for violating the league's 
substance-abuse policy. Teams with Jerry Gray for solid cornerback tandem. Was 
tied with Gray for second on the team in interceptions with three. Also had 52 
tackles and five sacks. 
</P>
<P>
ANTHONY NEWMAN 
</P>
<P>
Had 13 tackles and two interceptions as a rookie last year. Also had eight 
tackles on special teams. Played both cornerback and safety during college 
career at Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAFETIES 
</P>
<P>
VINCE NEWSOME 
</P>
<P>
A six-year pro, Newsome had 33 tackles and a fumble recovery last season. Was 
an honorable mention All-America as a senior at the University of Washington. 
Was born in Braintree, England. 
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL STEWART 
</P>
<P>
Rolled up some solid numbers last year, his second in the NFL. Was tied with 
Mark Jerue for fourth on the team in tackles with 60. Also chipped in 14 
tackles on special teams. Started 10 of 16 games and returned two interceptions 
for 61 yards. 
</P>
<P>
JAMES WASHINGTON 
</P>

</P>
<P>
LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
RICHARD BROWN 
</P>
<P>
The former Westminster High School standout has been a factor at inside 
linebacker during exhibition games. Was cut by the Rams during last year's 
camp. Returned a fumble 19 yards to set up a touchdown in 24-14 exhibition 
victory over Minnesota. A two-year starter at San Diego State, Brown was one of 
the biggest surprises in the 1987 training camp when he signed as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
BRETT FARYNIARZ 
</P>
<P>
Signed as a free agent last season. Played in 15 games and registered 10 
tackles and one sack. Earned second-team All-Western Athletic Conference honors 
at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
KEVIN GREENE 
</P>
<P>
Emerged as a force among outside linebackers in the league last year. His 16 
1/2 sacks were second only to Reggie White of Philadelphia. Can line up as a 
down lineman or as a pass rusher. A former intramural flag football player, 
Greene was walk-on at Auburn and eventually earned a starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
LARRY KELM 
</P>
<P>
Had 36 tackles last year, his second season in the league. Also had 10 tackles 
on special teams. Was picked in the fourth round of the 1987 draft from Texas 
A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
MIKE McDONALD 
</P>
<P>
Moves to center on deep-snap situations. Coach John Robinson considers him the 
best deep snapper he has ever coached. Played under Robinson at USC and 
attended Burroughs High School in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
MEL OWENS 
</P>
<P>
Fully recovered from sprained ankle he suffered in practice midway through last 
season, causing him to miss the rest of the year. Before the injury, the 
eight-year pro started four of seven games he played, but made the most of his 
playing time, with 21 tackles and five sacks. Before last season, he missed 
only two games in career due to injury and had played in 76 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
BRIAN SMITH 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-6, Smith looks more like a small forward than a tall linebacker. 
Former Auburn standout uses height to deflect passes. One of two linebackers 
taken in the second round along with Frank Stams of Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
FRANK STAMS 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' second-round pick from Notre Dame was drafted as an outside 
linebacker but has moved inside in some of the Rams' alignments. Made his first 
big impression in the Rams' 23-20 exhibition victory over Phoenix when he 
blocked a punt to set up a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
FRED STRICKLAND 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a solid rookie season. Had 43 tackles and four sacks in 16 games as 
a reserve. Was a second-round pick out of Purdue, where he set a school record 
for tackles with 321. 
</P>
<P>
MIKE WILCHER 
</P>
<P>
Had 59 tackles last season. His 7 1/2 sacks were third on the team behind Kevin 
Greene (16 1/2) and Doug Reed (11 1/2). Was drafted by Rams in the second round 
from North Carolina, where he replaced Lawrence Taylor, the Giants' Pro Bowl 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE TACKLES 
</P>
<P>
BILL HAWKINS 
</P>
<P>
The Rams hope their recently signed No. 1 draft pick from University of Miami 
will be worth every cent of the reported four-year, $1.9-million contract he 
signed late in exhibition play. Hawkins, 6-foot-6, 265 pounds, helped the 
Hurricanes win a national title in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
SHAWN MILLER 
</P>
<P>
Coming off one of the best seasons in five-year career. Finished with 35 
tackles and four sacks for a net loss of 28 yards. Was the defensive player of 
the year in the Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. as a senior at Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
MIKE PIEL 
</P>
<P>
Second-year player is having a solid exhibition season. Selected in third round 
of 1988 draft out of Illinois. Was a second-team junior college All-America at 
Saddleback College in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
DOUG REED 
</P>
<P>

fumble recovery. Earned junior college All-America honors at San Diego City 
College before transferring to San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
ALVIN WRIGHT 
</P>
<P>
A starter in every game last year, Wright registered 52 tackles and two sacks. 
It was his best season after compiling only 29 tackles in his first three years 
in the league. Signed as a free agent with the Rams in 1985, but spent the year 
on the injured-reserve list with a neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KICKERS 
</P>
<P>
DALE HATCHER 
</P>
<P>
Punted in seven games last season, averaging 39.8 yards. Has never averaged 
more than 43.2 yards a punt in his four-year pro career, but specializes in 
hang time. Played in Pro Bowl in 1985, his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
MIKE LANSFORD 
</P>
<P>
Showed solid range last season, his seventh in the league. The former

Ending a four-game losing streak, the Rams became the first team all season to 
deny the Chicago offense a touchdown, sparked by plays such as Anthony Newman's 
interception, right. Jim Everett teamed with Henry Ellard on a 31-yard scoring 
pass late in the third quarter, and Greg Bell later scored on a 1-yard run to
