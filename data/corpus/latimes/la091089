TOLL ROAD WARRIOR;

<P>
WILL CALIFORNIANS PAY TO AVOID SNARLED FREEWAYS? LIBERTARIAN BOB POOLE IS 
FIGHTING TO GIVE THEM THE CHANCE

IT'S A WARM, humid August morning at the Sacramento headquarters of Caltrans, 
where a small group is meeting in a utilitarian conference room to discuss what 
for California is a drastic idea: abandoning the state's exclusive reliance on 
freeways in favor of a mix that includes private toll roads. Caltrans assistant 
director Carl Williams, who is chairing this meeting, introduces Bob Poole to 
his fellow committee members as the man who "fired my imagination on this." 
</P>
<P>
By "this," Williams means a radical -- though as yet almost entirely 
unpublicized -- plan passed by the California Legislature in June as part of 
the governor's $18.5 billion transportation bill. It would authorize private 
companies to build four demonstration tollways in the state: one in northern 
California, one in the south and two up for grabs. Unlike conventional toll 
roads of the sort seen for decades back East, or even three Orange County 
public toll roads scheduled for completion in the mid '90s, these would be 
financed entirely with private funds and operated by private corporations. 
According to what investors are telling Williams in preliminary conversations, 
charges would run around 20 cents per mile for roads and perhaps 75 cents per 
mile for tunnels and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever feasible, these tollways would also take advantage of new technology 
that would allow drivers to attach a vehicle identification card the size of a 
credit card to the inside of their windshields, where they could be read by 
radio transmitter/receivers as the cars sailed up the on-ramps. Users might 
then get a monthly toll bill (not unlike a utility bill) or have the fees 
charged to to their credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Investors would have up to 35 years to recoup their investment and anticipated 
profits, then the state would take over the toll facilities. 
</P>
<P>
As Bob Poole sees it, such toll roads could eventually cover the most congested 
areas of California, much as they have in Italy, France and Spain where, 
according to Poole, some 5,000 miles of privately financed toll roads have been 
built since WWII. Although the plan is still in its infancy, Caltrans expects 
consortiums of investment bankers and construction firms to submit 30 to 100 
proposals in the next year, including ones for a toll tunnel under Laurel 
Canyon; a cars-only second deck on critical sections of the Ventura and San 
Diego freeways; and a new bridge across San Francisco Bay near the Oakland 
airport, with office buildings on its suspension towers. Construction on the 
projects won't begin for another three years. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is impressed by the tollway idea. Some see the unrestricted use of 
freeways as an egalitarian issue, and feel that when it comes to freedom of 
mobility, no one should have more of it than anyone else. And then there are 
the practical objections. "We are overbuilt in highways already," says Stanley 
Hart, a spokesman on transportation issues for the Sierra Club. "And anyone 
investing in such a project ought to have his head examined." Why would anyone 
pay to use a toll road if there was a freeway alternative? If it was up to him, 
says Hart, "I'd put my money in CDs and say the hell with it." 
</P>
<P>
SITTING BEHIND his desk at the Reason Foundation in Santa Monica, Bob Poole has 
the straightforward honest rectitude of a graduate student in engineering. 
Which is fitting, since he spends a good part of each day taking phone calls 
from people asking advice on everything from contracting out municipal 
street-sweeping services to privatizing the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
</P>
<P>
For Poole, who takes credit for coining the word "privatization" in his 1980 
book, "Cutting Back City Hall," all this is heady stuff. Back in the '70s, 
libertarians like Poole were widely regarded as free-market fanatics who went 
around wearing "Taxation is theft!" buttons and for whom life held no greater 
joy than sitting up all night debating such matters as whether their 
free-market philosophy gave them the moral right to oppose private ownership of 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But times have changed. The tax revolt of the '80s left many politicians so 
traumatized by the shortage of tax dollars that they are now more open to 
free-market alternatives. As a result, Poole, 45, who is both president of the 
Reason Foundation and publisher of Reason magazine, gets calls from the White 
House, federal transportation officials, assorted legislators, investment 
bankers, former Drexel Burnham Wunderkind and alleged crook Michael Milken (the 
featured speaker at the foundation's annual banquet this fall), and, most 
satisfying of all, from the awkwardly named Caltrans Privatization Advisory 
Steering Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of vindication," says Poole, who presents his ideas in a low-key, 
non-threatening manner. "Ten or 15 years ago, we felt like a voice crying in 
the wilderness . . . And these days, we are saying basically the same kinds of 
things and now we seem to be part of a worldwide trend." 
</P>
<P>
FOR SOMEONE who hopes to fundamentally change the way the government conducts 
its business, Poole is a reserved, private sort of guy. He builds model trains 
in his spare time (there's a hand- lettered "Keep Out" sign on the door to his 
train room in his Beverlywood home). When the master of ceremonies for the 20th 
anniversary of Reason magazine went around last year trying to collect funny 
anecdotes about Poole, he didn't come up with a single one -- which is not 
surprising to Poole's colleagues. "Bob is not a warm fuzzy person," says former 
Reason editor Marty Zupan. "He's the kind of person who gets excited by ideas." 
</P>
<P>
And the most exciting idea he ever heard was the philosophy advanced by Ayn 
Rand in the novel "Atlas Shrugged." Reading it during the early '60s while 
studying mechanical engineering at MIT, Poole discovered a world that to him 
seemed brilliantly clear, moral and above all, based on reason. After receiving 
his master's degree in 1967, he got a job as a weapons-systems analyst at 
Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford, Conn., where he was dismayed to discover that 
aerospace companies "were large bureaucracies and very dependent on government 
contracts." Declining to spend the rest of his life in a room with 500 other 
engineers "learning more and more about less and less," in 1969 Poole put his 
money where his free-market ideology was and decided to try writing, submitting 
an article on airline deregulation for a fledgling libertarian magazine called 
Reason. Seeing it published "was very exciting," says Poole. "I said to myself, 
'This beats the hell out of engineering.' " 
</P>
<P>
Deciding on a new career in public policy, Poole applied to such think tanks as 
the RAND Corp., the Hoover Institution and finally the General Research Corp. 
of Santa Barbara, where he studied private alternatives to public services. 
"What really got me," says Poole, "was the private fire department in 
Scottsdale, Ariz. My God! That was damn impressive." 
</P>
<P>
Poole took a first step toward founding his own think tank in the fall of 1970, 
when with five other investors he bought Reason magazine from its founder, a 
Boston College journalism student named Lanny Friedlander. Poole then spent the 
next eight years publishing it out of his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the magazine's unwavering commitment to the free market, in the early 
days the owners didn't know enough about marketing to run ads on the back 
cover. And for a magazine aimed at a popular audience, their article titles 
tended toward the arcane: "Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems" and 
"Chicago Monetary Tradition in the Light of Austrian Theory." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, circulation inched upward. Color was introduced. And in 1978, Reason 
was incorporated into a nonprofit educational foundation. The only problem was, 
by the mid-'80s, the foundation seemed to be floundering -- for a think tank 
with national pretensions, Santa Barbara was too small. 
</P>
<P>
There was an obvious alternative. In 1986, Poole brought Reason to Los Angeles. 
Despite some initial misgivings about living in a purported intellectual black 
hole, Poole and his wife (a budget analyst in the UCLA chancellor's office), 
quickly discovered that Los Angeles was the place to be. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation's budget increased from $1.2 million to $1.9 million. The media 
began asking Poole for quotes. And all the while, the foundation continued a 
steady drumbeat of reports and articles on the advantages of selling off the 
airports, jails, fire departments, garbage collection, the Postal Service and 
the Tennessee Valley Authority. Then in May, 1988, Poole published his landmark 
transportation report: "Private Tollways: Resolving Gridlock in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
UNLIKE SO MANY other transit planners who long ago gave up on automobiles in 
favor of heavy-rail transit, Poole rather admires freeways. They made a great 
contribution to California. They opened up the state. Not only did they permit 
a kind of untrammeled mobility never before possible, they were a concrete 
metaphor for the open-ended, soaring spirit of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Poole felt, they were a metaphor that didn't work anymore. How 
could anyone look at a freeway and feel his spirit soaring when, by 1986, 40% 
of California's urban roads were operating at a stop-and-go pace. By the year 
2010, argued Poole, the population of Southern California was expected to 
increase 36%. Average freeway speeds would drop from 35 to 11 mph. Billions of 
dollars' worth of fuel and time would be wasted annually in freeway gridlock, 
even as exhaust fumes poisoned the drivers. If there was a solution, it was 
clear to many that it wasn't just building more freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't build your way out of congestion," argues Peter Gordon, assistant 
dean of Urban and Regional Planning at USC. "When you add (freeway) capacity, 
you're simply inviting back all the people that congestion had driven away 
before." The freeway is filled to capacity practically from the day the ribbon 
is cut, and in no time at all you're back to where you started, except now 
there's more congestion, more pollution, a huge new debt and no net gain in the 
quality of life, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But by using toll roads with new automatic vehicle identification technology 
and congestion pricing, one could, argued Poole, raise the tolls enough during 
rush hours to divert non-essential traffic to cheaper off-peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
Although politicians tend to be a bit leery of an idea like congestion pricing, 
to economists it makes perfect sense: When you undercharge for anything, the 
product gets overconsumed at certain peak times and underused at others, which 
is why movie theaters charge less for matinees and phone companies cut the 
rates at night. 
</P>
<P>
And the problem with not charging for a scarce commodity like freeway space, 
argues USC's Peter Gordon, is that it encourages people for whom time is not an 
issue, like shoppers and other casual users, to drive the freeways at peak 
hours, thereby penalizing people who have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
To Poole, private toll roads with congestion pricing were a "win-win" 
proposition for everyone concerned. And in May, 1988, the Reason Foundation 
sent hundreds of copies of his report to public officials and private firms. 
</P>
<P>
The time was right. As a result of the federal budget deficit and rapidly 
approaching end of the federal interstate highway program, says Bruce Nestande, 
a member of the California Transportation Commission and former Orange County 
assemblyman, there was no more federal aid in the pipeline for building new 
freeways. In the meantime, says Nestande, the state was so far behind in 
upgrading 20- and 25-year-old freeways that just to keep them from further 
deterioration would require "a 15-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax tomorrow 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
To try to hold back the tide, Gov. Deukmejian pushed for a $1 billion stopgap 
highway bond issue on the June 7, 1988, ballot. When it was narrowly defeated, 
Bob Poole wrote an Op-Ed piece for the Los Angeles Times, pointing out that 
privately funded toll roads were already in widespread use in Europe, Asia and 
Australia. Even the $12 billion tunnel under the English Channel was being 
financed by private sources. Given the fact that nothing else seemed to be 
working, Poole argued, maybe it was time to look at this alternative. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Poole's article appeared, he got calls from both the governor's 
office and Caltrans assistant director Williams, who asked Poole to send him 
his private tollways report. "We were impressed," says Williams. And Caltrans 
promptly drafted a bill that Danville Republican Bill Baker gladly agreed to 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Baker bill became a bargaining chip in the governor's 
$18.5 billion gas tax compromise. Some Republicans agreed to accept the gas tax 
if they could get these demonstration tollways as part of the compromise 
package. And while some Democrats resisted the idea of making drivers pay to 
use highways, they were willing to swallow the plan if they could get a 
9-cents-a-gallon gas tax. At the same time, lots of other legislators from both 
parties didn't care one way or the other about the ideology -- they just wanted 
to do something about congestion. As a result, the bill made it through the 
legislative process virtually unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say that private tollways might not face opposition somewhere 
down the road. Despite having voted for the gas tax compromise, David Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles), President ProTem of the Senate, calls toll roads "foreign to 
our way of life." "There are certain functions the government is responsible 
for," he says, "and every time privatization comes up there should be strong 
opposition." Why, ask other critics, should wealthy people have the right to 
whiz to work on uncluttered expressways, while the rest of us fume and suffer 
on the freeways? 
</P>
<P>
In response, Poole contends that critics should remember that he is not 
proposing to take anything away -- he is merely offering a choice. No one will 
be forced to use toll roads if he doesn't want to and, in any case, the 
projects won't involve any public money. Under the circumstances, asks Poole, 
what's so awful about letting "fat cats in their BMWs willingly pay a bunch of 
extra money to use their cars?" To the extent that they draw traffic off the 
freeways, everyone has better mobility. "And I think that is a hell of a good 
deal for everyone concerned." 
</P>
<P>
As for objections that private toll roads will never be built because no one 
will risk their money in such a wild-eyed plan, Poole points to a long and 
growing list of major investment banking and construction firms that have 
already expressed interest in the projects, including a consortium of Japanese 
banks and insurance firms that recently wrote to Caltrans: "We understand you 
are considering a southern (San Francisco Bay) crossing. Do you think it would 
be possible for any of this financing to be Japanese?" 
</P>
<P>
In fact, says Kenneth Olson, vice president for public finance at Goldman 
Sachs, which is both the underwriter and an equity investor in a $150 million 
Dulles airport toll road extension in Virginia, he would be very surprised if 
all the major investment banking firms weren't taking a close look at private 
tollways: "The competition to participate in financing will be intense." 
</P>
<P>
Some people may ridicule privately financed toll roads now, says Poole, but 
wait until the first project goes into operation and everyone sees how 
profitable it is. Then, he says, the arguments will shift overnight from 
"They're going to go broke" to "What right do they have to get so rich?" 
</P>
<P>
As for Poole, he doesn't expect to spend all his life preaching the toll road 
gospel. Once the projects are launched, he intends to shift his focus to such 
matters as privatizing airports and the Postal Service, building private energy 
companies and selling the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
</P>
<P>
All over the world, he says, governments are discovering the advantages of 
selling off bloated bureaucracies to private enterprise: "Why should the TVA be 
off limits?"

TRADITION WITH A TWIST; 
</P>
<P>
BOLD COLOR AND EASY SHAPES GIVE CLASSIC MENSWEAR A SHOT IN THE ARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
JUST WHEN MANY MEN WERE thinking their wardrobes had been finalized in a 
classical mode -- Brooks Brothers, jeans or L. L. Bean -- an unstoppable design 
force is moving in and shaking things up. In the same way that architects 
Michael Graves and Frank Gehry add iconoclastic colors and shapes to classical 
forms, designers are adding modernity without forsaking their strengths. 
They're infusing the classics with bold color. They're relaxing the traditional 
silhouette. And they're showing sophisticated combinations of fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
The man who, in the past, stretched his style at the office with a yellow or 
red power tie will probably be the first to try the bolder, 3 3/8-inch print 
ties reminiscent of the '40s or a tie with buttonholes that attach to the 
buttons on his shirt. Men who first experimented with colored dress shirts will 
now choose shirts with fine details such as muted stripes in purple, teal or 
orange, hand-carved bone buttons or brightly colored solids in silk or fine 
cotton. Tasteful alternatives to ties and shirts are cashmere polo sweaters or 
mock turtlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
The standard blazer and three-button jacket also are evolving. A stalwart 
traditionalist, Ralph Lauren introduced a relaxed sack suit with three buttons, 
a single vent and flat-front pants in his fall, 1988, collection. This 
conservative shape triggered a fast-moving trend that calls for all jackets to 
be roomy but not sloppy and have softer, rounder shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Although trimmer than the baggy shapes of the past, pants this season have a 
relaxed, yet elegantly draped look. 
</P>
<P>
While the classic silhouette is still basically intact, designers are taking 
liberties with color. Even Giorgio Armani, who usually works with neutral 
colors, is combining red or orange scarfs and vests with subdued tones. The 
guideline for making the look work: The bolder the color, the simpler the 
shape. If the silhouette is avant-garde, keep the color discreet. 
</P>
<P>
Fall menswear is also sparked with costly fabrics such as cashmere and silk. 
Fortunately, there's a way to avoid expensive blunders while adding a touch of 
style: Invest in separates. A tobacco-color jacket, for example, works well 
with gray or black slacks. A bright tie or vest in a luxury fabric will add 
after-hours flair. It is a liberated personal style that befits the advent of 
the '90s.

THE BIG FIX-UP; 
</P>
<P>
ONCE YOU'VE BOUGHT A HOUSE, YOU'RE NEVER HOME FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGO KAUFMAN, Margo Kaufman is a contributing editor of this magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I THINK I'm going to lose my mind. I'm sitting in my office, which used to be a 
sanctuary, listening to Pedro and Martin sing "Volver, Volver" as they chip 
paint off the windowsill with a scraper. Are they ever going to finish working 
on our house? I wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I've been wondering that for quite some time now, and the end still 
isn't in sight. Though when it comes to home improvements, the end is never in 
sight. To own a house is to be its slave. No matter what you put in, no matter 
what you rip out, there is always another imperfection that demands your 
attention. And that imperfection (be it large or small) invariably leads you 
into the Land of Chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I feel guilty for complaining. I'm lucky to own my own home. For years, 
I dreamed of living in this little white house by the sea. I imagined a cozy 
cottage with a picket fence, peg and groove floors, a flower garden and plenty 
of storage space. But I never imagined how much time, energy and aggravation 
this fantasy would actually take. 
</P>
<P>
Who does? "You're fed this bill of goods that it's smart to buy a house," says 
my friend Marjorie, who bought a house last October. "You get equity. You get a 
tax break. You're not wasting money paying rent. But rent isn't a waste of 
money. It's what you pay to not have to deal with a house." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Marjorie's deal with her house sounds more like a deal with the 
devil. She's taking off the roof and building a second story -- just as soon as 
she finds a contractor. Meanwhile, she and her mate are shelling out mortgage 
payments, interest on their construction loan and rent on the house they're 
currently living in. "And we don't know anything of misery yet," says Marjorie, 
"because construction hasn't even begun." 
</P>
<P>
Why not? "It takes months to make the design. And even longer to get the 
permits," Marjorie tells me, thus strengthening my resolve to never build 
anything bigger than bookshelves. "And if you're asking for a variance, you've 
got to get approvals, which take forever. And then you find a contractor, and 
he gives you a bid, and the bid is $50,000 more than you ever thought you'd 
spend." 
</P>
<P>
In my experience, any home improvement costs more than you ever thought you'd 
spend. Then again, I used to believe that God gave you kitchen cabinets, 
asphalt driveways and hardwood floors. Other people are more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the problem, it's always a thousand dollars," says my friend Nina. 
"It's this magical figure. It can be a pane of glass. Or a little plumbing. You 
name it." (While this seems impossible, homeowners quickly discover that 
there's no such thing as a minor repair. You go out to replace a $5 bolt, and 
before you know it, a man in a giant payloader is pouring concrete in your 
window.) 
</P>
<P>
But Nina has never hired anyone, so she has no idea of what the actual cost 
could be. "When someone gives my husband a price, he flips out and says, 'I can 
do it myself for much less,' " she explains. "And I can't justify spending the 
money when he's so handy. Though I'd like to say, 'Honey, I don't doubt that 
you can do it, but I was kind of thinking that it would be nice to have it done 
this year.' " 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, like many do-it-yourselfers, her husband finds it easier to 
start a home-improvement project than to finish it. The demolition always goes 
quickly, even for semiskilled laborers. But as for putting it back together . . 
. Nina has been doing without a kitchen floor for eight months now. And the 
wife of another Handy Andy I know has gone two years without ceilings. I would 
find living in a house with an open wound to be more than a little bit 
stressful. Of course, I get nervous watching my husband drill holes to install 
mini-blinds. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, "many people become slaves to their homes to reduce anxiety," says 
Los Angeles psychologist Gary Emery. "They've got something else in their life 
that they can't manage, so their house becomes the distraction, the one thing 
they can control." 
</P>
<P>
As far as I'm concerned, the only person who has his house under control is Pop 
Larsen, the fictional sage of Builders Emporium. As for the rest of us . . . 
"The more you try to control something, the more out of control it becomes," 
Emery explains. "Nothing stays perfect. Even if you get it fixed for 15 
minutes, something else goes wrong. You start by changing the doorknob and wind 
up having to redo the whole house." 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Three weeks ago, my husband arrived home from the office with 
Pedro and Martin. "They're looking for work," Duke said. "I thought they could 
clean up the yard." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed like a good idea at the time. The yard was overgrown with withered 
rye grass and weeds. It had to be cleared out before we could plant whatever 
mystery shrub happens to thrive in total shade and sand. So Pedro and Martin 
started digging. 
</P>
<P>
"The yard looks a million times better," Duke marveled that evening, his heart 
swelling with the pride of homeownership. For a moment, I, too, basked in the 
satisfaction that comes with putting your house in order. Then he suggested 
that the back of the house could use a coat of paint. 
</P>
<P>
We really hadn't planned on painting the back of the house. But making home 
improvements is an addiction that can be cured only by bankruptcy. "As long as 
they're here," said Duke, who eagerly rushed to Standard Brands and wrote a 
large check for brushes, rollers, masking tape, a 14-foot ladder and a 5-gallon 
tub of paint. 
</P>

"You bought the wrong color!" I wailed with dismay two hours later when I 
discovered that the back of our house was now French vanilla and the rest of 
the house was snow white. 
</P>
<P>
"No hay problema, Senora," Pedro said cheerfully. "Podemos pintar toda la 
casa." 
</P>
<P>
"The whole house really does need to be painted," Duke said. That was easy for 
him to say. He doesn't work at home. While he's safely insulated in his office, 
I'm home juggling deadlines and Pedro and Martin. The minute I receive a 
long-awaited long-distance call from an interview subject or editor whom I've 
been chasing for weeks, I hear another urgent cry of "Senora!" Which is my cue 
to drop what I'm doing and fetch "mas pintura," "mas Hefty bolsas," or "mas 
dinero." 
</P>
<P>
Still, I must admit that Pedro and Martin are doing a wonderful job. And I 
would be thrilled except that a freshly painted house just points out how 
shabby the fence is, how dilapidated the roofing tiles look and how badly the 
driveway needs to be paved. And my editors are beginning to wonder why all my 
stories are late. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what we should do to our house . . .," Duke says when he returns 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"Live in it," I reply.

LIFEGUARDS TAKE COVER WITH SUNSCREENS, SHIRTS AND SHADES

ASK SANTA Monica State Beach lifeguard Jackie Burke about her skin-care routine 
and she starts spouting off SPF numbers. "A 40 on my lips, 30 on my face, 15 on 
my arms and chest and 6 on my legs," says the blue-eyed blonde just before 
ripping off her regulation red jacket and white T-shirt and jumping into the 
Pacific for a save. 
</P>
<P>
Protecting herself from the ravages of the sun is Burke's biggest concern, so 
she takes extra care to apply sunscreen lotions with higher SPF levels where 
her skin is more sensitive. To combat the drying effects of the sun after 
exposure, she also moisturizes her face and conditions her hair daily. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California lifeguards like Burke realize that spending eight hours on 
the beach every workday can make sun-induced skin cancer an occupational 
hazard. Many who used to wear deep-bronze tans like badges of honor can almost 
pass for pale office workers, even after an entire summer in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the information about skin cancer and premature aging of the skin started 
coming out, lifeguards jumped right on it," says a decidedly untanned Matt 
Karl, who has been a Huntington Beach lifeguard for the past nine years. Karl 
now wears a long-sleeved T-shirt every day, in addition to an SPF 30 sunscreen 
lotion, to protect his fair skin. "Once you hear about another guard getting 
cancer," he says, "you think about it every day." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four-year-old Howard Lee, chief lifeguard of the Los Angeles County 
Department of Beaches and Harbor, has worked the beaches for 36 years. He had 
manned a guard tower for about 12 years when he developed skin cancer on his 
lip, and he recently had more cancerous cells removed from his shoulder. 
"Thirty years ago, we used baby oil to fry our skin," remembers Lee, who also 
has no semblance of a tan today. "It's not uncommon for (veteran) lifeguards to 
develop skin cancer. Now, because we have more knowledge, the guards check 
unusual skin conditions early, before they become cancerous." 
</P>
<P>
Although the county has no regulations about skin protection for lifeguards, 
Lee distributes advisory information at least twice each summer to notify his 
team of lifeguards about the latest developments in skin cancer research and 
sun protection. He also encourages the men and women to wear protective 
clothing such as hats and Windbreakers. But the decision to take these 
precautions is up to each individual, he explains. "When there's a lot of 
rescue activity going on, it's not always possible to keep a shirt and hat on." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bitler, who has been a lifeguard at Will Rogers State Beach for 17 years, 
says that only the new lifeguards appear to feel invulnerable to the sun and 
still go after a tan. By contrast, he wears an SPF 15 sunscreen and a jacket 
most days and sees a dermatologist for checkups -- just in case there might be 
early signs of the disease. "You start taking precautions as soon as your older 
co-workers start developing skin problems -- or as soon as you see the first 
signs of aging on your own skin," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, Christian Henry has spent six months of the year working as a 
Huntington Beach lifeguard. Bombarded by the media and his supervisors with 
information about the dangers of the sun, he's become extra cautious. Now he 
wears a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses with ultraviolet light protection, and 
he slathers on SPF 30. He also applies moisturizer to keep his skin supple. But 
despite his efforts, Henry's skin is tanned, a sign that it hasn't escaped 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
What is an occupational hazard for lifeguards is, of course, a recreational 
hazard for the general public. So lifeguards also spend time trying to protect 
sunbathers, especially those who coat themselves with baby oil or low-SPF 
tanning products. For Henry, observing sunburned beach-goers is one of the 
job's frustrations. "I see it happening every day, but by the time I warn them, 
it's usually too late -- they're already fried."

Houston uses the buzz words "cop-killer bullets" and "assault rifles," neither 
of which are accurate descriptions -- they are are phrases manufactured by 
anti-gun organizations. The correct terminology is "armor-piercing ammunition," 
designed for use by police and military. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, there is no such thing as an "assault rifle." If a 2x4 were used in 
the attack, would you call it an "assault board"?

As a member of the NRA, I think there ought to be a referee to whom I could 
complain that the magazine published a picture of a NRA member clowning in a 
Darth Vader-ish helmet and then showed gun-controller Sen. Dennis DeConcini 
smiling under a ceiling light that gave the effect of a halo.

What so many anti-gun fanatics fail to realize is why the 2nd Amendment was 
added to the Constitution. It was not added so that citizens could own weapons 
for hunting, target shooting, collecting or even for protecting their lives, 
their families or their property from criminals. It was added for one reason: 
so that the people could protect themselves from the government. 
</P>
<P>
This is such an incredibly easy fact to document and fits so well with the 
liberal philosophy of civil rights and fighting for the little people against 
the mighty forces of the government that it is virtually inconceivable that 
today it is the liberal that is at the forefront of the anti-gun movement.

ALICE KAHN: THE EDUCATION OF A PARENT NEVER ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two ways to deal with an educator. Surrender or deceit. 
</P>
<P>
In my own school days, I opted for surrender. As a result, I got mediocre 
grades, had lousy teachers and never told a lie. 
</P>
<P>
It was a well-known fact in my high school that the way to get an A from a 
certain English teacher was to stand on the window ledge and threaten suicide. 
Never mind that dozens of kids did this every year. Never mind that the 
classroom was on the first floor. It worked every time. While suckers like me 
spent hours on "Julius Caesar: Man or Mouse?"other kids climbed the ledge and 
got A's. 
</P>
<P>
I was reminded of this when a mother I know told me she persuaded her son's 
principal to put him in a better class by threatening suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Like millions of other parents, I face a dilemma. Do I sit idly by and let my 
children get bad teachers while other parents threaten suicide so their kids 
can get into Harvard? 
</P>
<P>
I have tried honest talk with school principals, and it just doesn't work. They 
are protected by entire squadrons of jargon. 
</P>
<P>
"You see, Dr. Nitwit, if my child doesn't learn to read this year," the earnest 
parent says, "I'm afraid she'll go through life with a disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Stupid Middle-Class Selfish Pig," Dr. Nitwit says, "but I have 
an entire program to consider. I have children from dysfunctional homes. I have 
curriculum to develop. I have staff with skill deficiencies. And, of course, I 
have my own career enrichment priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Look, I absolutely don't believe in lying. But with your children, you get a 
chance to relive your life. Do I want to relive it as an underachiever? 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to your kids, you are just a lioness in the jungle defending your 
cubs. You will do all sorts of unimaginable things in the name of protecting 
your young. 
</P>
<P>
Once, I threatened a perfectly innocent camp director who refused to admit my 
daughter to Camp Happy Rainbow. I have never abused the power of the press 
except this one time. I grabbed him by his whistle and said, "Look, bub. You 
leave me no choice but satire. How would you like to see the headline 'Neal the 
Inept Camp Director' sprawled across the morning paper?" 
</P>
<P>
When I felt my child was facing a make-or-break year, I pleaded with the 
principal. I wept. I bared my soul. I tried everything I could short of 
dishonesty or suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Kahn," she said. "But I have to study my charts. I have to be 
sure we maintain the gender and ethnic balance. I have political 
considerations." 
</P>
<P>
"OK, Vicki," I shouted at her, dropping the Dr. Nitwit routine. "I'm going to 
tell you something few people know about my family." 
</P>
<P>
I had her attention. I had to come up with something. 
</P>
<P>
"Vicki, many, many years ago, a Cherokee Indian visited my grandmother's shtetl 
in Poland. As a result of that visit, my child is kind of an ethnic group unto 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
Then I smiled that cute little smile that I felt said, "Ya can't blame a mom 
for trying." 
</P>
<P>
But all Dr. Vicki Nitwit-Savant said was, "Is that true?" 
</P>
<P>
"Vicki," I said, "would I lie to you?" 
</P>
<P>
Already my mind was racing ahead to Plan B: What to do when Plan A fails. 
"Vicki, I'm going to tell you something no one knows -- not even my husband. 
You remember when Sammy Davis played the Coliseum nine years ago -- exactly 
nine months before my daughter was born? As a result of that one-night stand, I 
think we can help you balance the third grade. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
And then I was on to Plan C. The floodgates were open. It wasn't lying. It was 
creative parenting. "You know, Vicki, I'm from Chicago. We had ways of solving 
problems there -- ways that were mutually satisfying for all parties. Now, what 
is this cockamamie school district paying a woman of your talents, your 
abilities, your SAT scores? Would, say, a C-note help you achieve your full 
potential?" 
</P>
<P>
So, if you are a parent trying to lie, cheat, bribe and threaten your child's 
way into a classroom, I'm here to say: It is wrong. W-R-O-N-G. But I 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
As Rambo said, "This time we win."

SHORT TAKES: AN INSPIRED LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK RORABACK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Had penicillin been invented, she might have become a ballerina. Or a pilot, or 
chairperson of General Motors. As it was, Carol Iverson, whose appendix had 
ruptured, was laid up for no fewer than five weeks in a hospital in Minot, 
N.D., "where a nurse sprinkled sulfa powder daily on my raw incision." 
</P>
<P>
Iverson was only 5, but "I remember the nurse clearly. I never forgot her 
dedication, and I decided to follow in her footsteps." 
</P>
<P>
It's many a measle from a two-room schoolhouse "outside of Mohall, N.D." 
(itself barely inside metropolitan America) to election by one's peers as 
"National School Nurse of 1989," but Iverson has managed the passage with wit, 
understanding and an encompassing compassion for today's stressed-out 
schoolchild. 
</P>
<P>
Iverson last week was back in San Diego, in whose school system she nursed for 
11 years (after stints as head Ob-Gyn nurse at Los Angeles' Queen of Angels and 
as colonel in the Air Force Nurse Corps). Sponsored by the Beecham Co., she is 
on a back-to-school U.S. tour, addressing pupils' more common health problems: 
indigestion ("They eat too quickly"), headaches ("Today's children are under 
much more pressure to succeed") and head lice. 
</P>
<P>
Head lice? Schools record some 10 million cases a year, most having little to 
do with cleanliness. "Even in super-clean Omaha (where she now lives) it's a 
yearlong problem," says Iverson. "The student must be sent home immediately -- 
lice are highly contagious. But rather than shave the head and apply kerosene 
as they did in the past, the child simply shampoos with something like A-200; 
the parent does an environmental clean-up (sheets, rugs, etc.), and the child 
can be sent right back." 
</P>
<P>
With so many more mothers working, the school nurse, says Iverson, virtually 
has become a surrogate mother. "They come in with a tummy ache or a headache or 
some other unconscious stress symptom. I usually give them 10 minutes of 
individual attention and rest, and send them back to class. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they just need that person they know and they trust. Often enough, 
these days, it's the school nurse." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catering Pioneers 
</P>
<P>
Somebody comes to your home and cooks your favorite dinner, with ruffles, 
flourishes and a dessert to die for. That's the "Dine" part. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously -- and on the assumption that a laid-back bod animates the 
appetite -- somebody else gives you and your Significant Other a sensual 
Swedish massage, the last stroke timed to the first course. That's the "Pamper" 
part. 
</P>
<P>
Combined, the sybaritic service is called Pamper and Dine. Matthew Sarver is 
the professional chef who'll consult with you beforehand on the meal's elements 
(or surprise you, if you choose); bring his own raw materials, utensils, place 
settings, flowers, and whip up anything from homard to haggis. While Sarver is 
bopping about your kitchen, Amy Tunick, a graduate massage therapist who's 
brought her own table and appropriate music, will tune your torso to the 
precise point of ease (and no further: "She could relax you so much you'd never 
make it to the table," says partner Sarver). 
</P>
<P>
The couple don't come cheap (from $300 for two hours, including two half-hour 
massages, to $500 for "extremely formal, upscale service"), but after a 
February start, they're already busy enough in the L.A. area to be considering 
franchising, if they could only find similar pairs with their expertise, their 
dedication and their professed raison d'etre ("Each in our own way," says 
Sarver, "we love to make people feel good." 
</P>
<P>
"We've put something together that's really in demand," says Sarver. "Bear in 
mind that we're getting into the 'cocooning '90s,' when everyone wants things 
brought into their home. It feels good to be a trailblazer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Sticky Side 
</P>
<P>
A person with a lack of gumption (courage, chutzpah, what have you) often is 
described as a "jellyfish." Sorry, wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually colorless, admittedly spineless and resembling nothing so much as 
James Thurber's amorphous "blob of glup," the jellyfish nevertheless packs a 
powerful punch. Dangling from its central mass, or blobitude, are tentacles 
tipped with stingers, stingers that keep stinging even after the sucker is 
dead. And if you've ever tangled with one, you remember it. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Soppe remembers. 
</P>
<P>
Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water, Soppe, 
family-practice-medicine resident at Long Beach Memorial, has published an 
article, "Marine Envenomations and Aquatic Dermatology," in the current issue 
of American Family Physician. 
</P>
<P>
Soppe, an avid surfer and diver, zeroes in on some of offshore California's 
more pestilential prowlers, in particular the jellyfish, "which can be pretty 
bothersome." 
</P>
<P>
"Around here," says Soppe, "they're usually 4 to 6 inches in diameter with 
sticky little tentacles hanging from their main body. Sometimes they'll sting 
and fall away. Others stick like lace." 
</P>
<P>
Soppe advises caking the stung area with baking soda and water, or even shaving 
cream, which aids in brushing the tentacles off "tangentially, so you don't 
shove them in. Don't rub or you'll release more venom. Scrape 'em off as you do 
a bee sting, with a credit card or something. Then soak in diluted vinegar. Not 
in fresh water -- that'll just disperse the venom." 
</P>
<P>
Other local hazards are stingrays, scorpion fish, sea urchins . . . all of 
which are generally avoidable and eminently treatable, if pesky. "Still," says 
Soppe, "the most common sting at the beach is sunburn." DICK RORABACK

ON AGING: PROGRAMS FOR OLDER JOB-SEEKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By the UCLA/USC Long-Term Care Gerontology Center 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many older job-seekers are professionals who face difficulty in their search. 
Labor Department data from 1988 show that more than 25% of employed workers 
over age 55 hold managerial and professional positions. And nearly one-third of 
the 3,600 older job-seekers who called the Job Hotline of the Los Angeles 
Council on Careers for Older Americans in 1988 were in managerial or 
professional positions. An estimated 600,000 mid-level white-collar positions 
were eliminated in the United States by exit incentives between 1980 and 1986, 
and an additional 400,000 will be eliminated by 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The older professional job-seeker faces three major barriers. First, few 
programs are designed to assist the mature professional, and limited government 
funds are designated to help this population re-enter the work force. Business 
outplacement programs are generally reserved for high-level executives, not 
mid-managers or professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Second, age discrimination can be a greater barrier for the older professional 
than for the lower-skilled job-seeker, because employers view older 
professionals as more expensive human-resource investments. 
</P>
<P>
Third, many people, including older professionals themselves, believe that 
people who have made "career progress," even modestly climbing the corporate 
ladder, should be able to handle the job search alone. However, most 
professionals need help marketing their skills, developing a network of people 
with common interests, and learning the tricks, such as how to summarize 30 
years of employment on a one-page resume. 
</P>
<P>
Some nonprofit and for-profit organizations, particularly in larger urban 
areas, have begun to recognize this need and develop programs to assist older 
professionals. Some are described in responses to the questions that follow. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Six months ago, I took early retirement from my position as vice 
president of public relations with a major bank. I am an energetic, 60-year-old 
woman who wants to work. I have sent out more than 100 resumes but have 
received very few responses -- three interviews and no job offers. What help is 
available? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Eight coordinating councils operate model older-worker programs 
throughout the country. Six of these (in Boston; Chicago; Detroit; Lincoln, 
Neb.; Los Angeles and New York City) have programs designed specifically for 
managers or professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these councils offer intensive three- or four-day job-search seminars 
focusing on skills assessment, interview practice, resume development, 
networking and generating leads. Several programs offer extensive follow-up 
activities, including staff contacts with program participants each week. 
Placement results have been exceptional: Project ABLE of Detroit reports a 75% 
placement rate and Boston ABLE a 60% placement rate. 
</P>
<P>
According to Denise Jessup of the Los Angeles Council on Careers for Older 
Americans, "Older professionals have special needs in the job search. These 
programs have been designed with the recognition that older job-seekers face a 
great deal of rejection. Feeling positive about your skills and what you can 
offer an employer is the first step toward capturing a new job." Write the Los 
Angeles Council on Careers for Older Americans, 5225 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 204, 
Los Angeles 90036, for information about the nearest coordinating council. 
</P>
<P>
Other nonprofit organizations also attempt to meet the needs of older 
professionals. Nationwide, there are 16 independent Forty Plus organizations. 
These groups have a self-help focus; their main function is to help members 
help themselves get jobs. There is usually no paid staff; volunteer work is 
required of members, who generally pay an initial membership and monthly fee. 
Telephones, desks, word processors, support groups, job-search seminars, want 
ads and other publications are available. To locate the Forty Plus nearest you, 
look in your local phone book or call the Los Angeles chapter at (213) 
388-2301.

ERMA BOMBECK: ALL SHE NEEDS IS A SPORTING CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck

<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout the years I have eliminated from my life one sport after another. It 
began with skiing, when I didn't see the wisdom of pursuing any type of 
recreation where an ambulance was parked at the bottom of the hill. 
Synchronized swimming didn't do it for me either, as my best feature is my nose 
and I don't necessarily need a nose plug attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
I discovered tennis to be a sport that attracted people you couldn't trust. One 
minute, they smiled when your serve tipped the net and shouted, "Take two." The 
next, they purposely slammed a ball into the opposite side from where you were 
standing waiting for it. 
</P>
<P>
People who hop on a luge and bounce along out of control at 80 m.p.h. on a 
sheet of ice are just real strange. And besides, my stomach sticks out . . . 
even when I lie on my back. 
</P>
<P>
You may now add rock climbing to my list. I remember the first time I saw a 
rock climber on television. He weighed about 38 pounds and for no reason began 
to scale a perfectly vertical slab of rock. If I had Velcro hands and Robert 
Redford was hosting an Amway party at the top, you couldn't have gotten me to 
do that. 
</P>
<P>
You can imagine my surprise when I read a story the other day that said 
climbers are now using artificial walls to "eliminate environmental damage." 
</P>
<P>
I care about this planet as much as the next person, but how many people do you 
know who go out on Sunday and hang onto a piece of rock with their fingernails? 
Five? Ten? Twenty? Are we talking crowds here? 
</P>
<P>
There couldn't be more than a handful with that kind of guts, and that doesn't 
exactly add up to rock gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
There are fears that go with every sport -- fear of having your bowling ball 
bounce into the next lane . . . fear of knocking your tennis ball into the club 
dining room . . . fear of having a leg cramp playing Goony Golf . . . and fear 
of being the only person ever to ride a chair lift all day without getting off 
once. 
</P>
<P>
But rock climbing! I didn't figure on being afraid I'd destroy the environment. 
I would prefer to wonder what would happen if you reached for a little "bolt" 
to hang onto the rock and it turned out to be a snake's head. I'm sorry, but I 
want a sport where I can show my broken nail to someone without having it be my 
last words. As for adventure -- appearing in aerobics in a yellow leotard is as 
crazy as I want to get.

OUTTAKES: RED ALL OVER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When producer Irwin Winkler asked writer-director Abraham Polonsky to 
collaborate with him on a film about a blacklisted Hollywood director, Winkler 
had the right guy. Polonsky, blacklisted himself in 1951, had plenty to write 
about. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, however, a screenplay is circulating with both their names on 
it -- and Polonsky's notified the Writers Guild that he wants his removed. 
</P>
<P>
"That script was not written by me, not a single word is mine," Polonsky told 
Outtakes. "There is no political basis to it, which is what I intended." 
</P>
<P>
Polonsky, 78, who wrote the classic 1947 John Garfield film "Body and Soul," 
said Winkler rewrote the script without consulting him and, as a sop, offered 
to make him exec producer. Polonsky declined. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler acknowledged rewriting the script: "I wanted a story about how the 
blacklist affects (the director's) life, his family, his friends, his jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Polonsky, feeling that stories about blacklist victims have been done to death, 
said he wanted "a picture about someone who's guilty of being a radical and has 
to face the problem and say, 'Yes, I'm a communist and I don't have to answer 
any questions about my politics . . . That's my right." 
</P>
<P>
Winkler said he'll let the Guild determine credits when the film is finished. 
Polonsky wants action now. 
</P>
<P>
"As it stands," he said, "if the movie is made, I would get sole screen credit, 
and I don't want any credit for it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Polonsky and producer Mike Kaplan plan to adapt "Season of Fear," a 
novel Polonsky wrote during the blacklist period, about a water engineer caught 
up in the paranoia of the Red Scare. Jack Mathews

Talking screenplay credits: Is Phil Alden Robinson -- writer-director of the 
weepy, uplifting "Field of Dreams" -- embarrassed by his script for 
"Relentless"? The potboiler, starring Judd Nelson as a deranged police academy 
reject-turned-serial killer, opened to mixed reviews Sept. 1, managing $3.2 
million in ticket sales its first weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But the name Phil Alden Robinson wasn't in the credits. 
</P>
<P>
A source tells us that Robinson -- who wrote the script several years ago, 
"before his career took another turn" -- won't allow the producing CineTel 
Films or the distributing New Line Cinema to connect his name to the movie. 
</P>
<P>
The credited screenwriter is "Jack T.D. Robinson." Sources tell us that's "Jack 
the Dog" -- Robinson's pooch. 
</P>
<P>
Calls to Robinson weren't returned. Pat H. Broeske

Two factions are battling for long-term lease rights to the 1940-vintage 
Hollywood Palladium. Sources say one group of bidders favors preservation of 
the wood floor ballroom -- known as the largest in the U.S. -- while the other 
-- a group said to include investors from Hong Kong -- intends to transform a 
major portion of the Palladium into a multi-media studio operation. 
</P>
<P>
Palladium management and the bidders are mum about negotiations. But an insider 
tells us that several members of the Palladium's board of directors (a 
consortium of five Hollywood parking lot operators owns the building) became 
upset over proposed plans to alter the landmark -- and are now leaning toward 
the domestic group that would keep the Palladium as is. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agent David Cameron, who represents the partly foreign contingent, 
dismissed the competition's threat: "We have the deal," he insisted. "It's ours 
. . . it's progressed 98% of the way. We already have the liquor license (and) 
are waiting for the rest of the permits." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Larry Worschell, acting in the place of Palladium board chairman 
George Ullman, who died last month, declined to comment on the situation. Stacy

"Ripper" -- about a young man obsessed with vengeance, following the brutal 
rape and murder of his fiancee -- is so violent that it will be sealed in a

NEWS NOTES: The syndicated TV show "Smash Hits" bows Sept. 23 with a 
sweepstakes promotion in which a viewer will win a "rock 'n' roll prize 
package." And they're not just talking about Joan Jett's key chain and Tom 
Petty's cigarette lighter. The package consists of a bass autographed by Paul 
McCartney, keyboards autographed by Elton John, a guitar signed by Jon Bon 
Jovi, and drums inscribed by Phil Collins. The winner will be announced early 
next month. The half-hour show, which will air on KNBC-TV in Los Angeles on 
Saturdays at 2:30 p.m., will be hosted by deejay Scott Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
Michael and Janet Jackson aren't the only members of that famous family with 
albums slated for release before Christmas. Jermaine is expected Oct. 3 with 
"Don't Take It Personal," Randy is due Oct. 17 with "Randy and the Gypsies," 
and Marlon weighs in Nov. 7 with "Marlon Jackson." LaToya Jackson, meanwhile, 
who bared herself earlier this year in the pages of Playboy magazine, is 
seeking to capitalize on the association. Her new album -- which has been 
released only in Europe -- features songs titled "Bad Girl" and "Playboy." 
</P>
<P>
Belinda Carlisle's upcoming album, "Runaway Horses," will contain a flyer 
promoting two charities: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and Earth 
Communication Office, which works to raise awareness of the Greenhouse Effect. 
. . . PolyGram Records obviously expected "Great Balls of Fire," the recent 
film biography of Jerry Lee Lewis, to be a hit. The company is releasing three 
(count 'em) double album sets titled "The Killer," collecting Lewis' work from 
1963 to 1977. Avoid the rush: Eurythmics have already filmed four videos to 
support songs from their upcoming "We Too Are One" album. . . . The upcoming 
feature film "Rising Storm" will be dedicated to Tom Donahue and other pioneers 
of free-form FM radio in the '60s. The film, due in January, concerns a 
futuristic America ruled by a dictatorial televangelist. . . . MTV nixed the 
original version of Aerosmith's "Love in an Elevator" video, which showed side 
and rear views of a topless woman, but is airing a compromise version with 
black "censored" bars over the racier scenes.

ART NEWS: A MURAL THAT'S NOT GONE WITH THE WIND

"It's really a trip through the movie," says painter Stephen Verona of his 
100-foot mural commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the epic "Gone With the 
Wind." "(By viewing the mural) you can walk into this movie and feel all those 
famous moments that we've grown up watching in clips all of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Verona has spent a year making his acrylic-on-masonite mural, which is on view 
this week (Tuesday through Saturday) at the Andrea Ross Gallery, 2110 Broadway, 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"The mural depicts in chronological order the entire movie," said Verona, 
adding that he has included such famous scenes such as Tara, the burning of 
Atlanta, the Civil War and Twelve Oaks. The "modular mural" also contains 
life-size cutouts of the film's stars Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. 
</P>
<P>
Verona, who is also a film maker ("The Lords of Flatbush," "Boardwalk"), said 
creating the mural enabled him to bring his two passions together. 
</P>
<P>
The mural was commissioned by Turner Home Entertainment and is scheduled to go 
on display at Turner Broadcasting Systems headquarters in Atlanta for "Gone 
With the Wind's" 50th anniversary celebrations in December. 
</P>
<P>
GRANTS: The Getty Center for Education in the Arts has awarded $3.75 million in 
grants to six U.S. institutions as part of its continuing effort to restructure 
the way visual arts are taught in the nation's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Each institution will receive $625,000 (which will be provided in five yearly 
increments of $125,000 and must be matched by each institution) to establish 
regional institutes to provide general classroom teachers, art specialists, and 
school administrators with intensive training in the theory and application of 
the Getty's discipline-based art education program. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty program advocates that art should be taught with the same substance 
and rigor as other basic subjects by integrating skills, knowledge and 
understanding from the disciplines of art production, art history, art 
criticism and aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
Those institutions receiving the grants are the Florida Institute for Art 
Education, the Minnesota Discipline-based Art Education Consortium, Nebraska 
Prairie Visions, the North Texas Regional Institute for Educators on the Visual 
Arts, the Southeast Institute for Education in the Visual Arts, and the Ohio 
Partnership for the Visual Arts/Regional Institute for Educators. 
</P>
<P>
FRINGE: The third annual Fringe of the Fringe Arts Festival in Pomona Valley 
begins its month-long festivities on Saturday. Featuring about 500 artists from 
the inland communities, the festival will include exhibitions of art, music,

through Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 of the area's galleries and museums are scheduled to have shows 
coinciding with the festival, and a series of artists' lectures will be held at 
4:30 p.m. on Wednesdays in the Claremont Graduate School Art Building. Opening 
the festival on Saturday is a mask parade, sidewalk arts fair and concert at 
Claremont's Memorial Park.

GETTING DOWN HOME JAMAICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BURUM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago, a super-hot Caribbean food trend flashed through L.A. faster than 
you can say cha cha cha. The era spawned a few good eating spots that still 
serve tropical rum drinks and cruise ship-style fantasy dishes. 
</P>
<P>
But these aren't the restaurants where L.A.'s transplanted Jamaicans typically 
eat. They do their eating in neighborhood sorts of places that serve up 
true-to-its-roots Jamaican comfort food. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these cafes prepare the kind of time-consuming dishes that most urban 
Jamaicans would rather leave to the talent (and patience) of a good cook: 
stewed chicken and fried dumplings, long simmered oxtail stew and the 
inevitable rice-and-bean staple (called "rice and peas" in the Jamaican 
tradition at most of these restaurants) cooked in seasoned coconut milk. 
</P>
<P>
The essence of Jamaica's national slogan -- "out of many, one people" -- also 
suits the island's eclectic cuisine. Waves of European conquerors, millions of 
West African slaves and East Indian indentured servants have all stirred a 
little something into Jamaica's well-seasoned melting pot. It's a place where 
curry dishes and roti (an Indian bread) are as popular as proper British 
afternoon tea. 
</P>
<P>
Swirls of Reggae concert flyers decorate the walls of the dining room at Del 
Rose Act I. Red tablecloths, intense yellow place mats and vivid green napkins, 
along with boxes of fresh plantains for sale near the take-out window, give 
this nondescript storefront the feeling of the sun-drenched Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Each time I've eaten here everything's been expertly prepared -- even the fish 
-- and that's not always the case in Jamaican restaurants. Large red snappers 
are sliced into thick steaks, then lightly dusted with flour and "escoviched" 
(sauteed onions and seasoned vinegar are poured over them just as they finish 
cooking). A mound of rice and peas, fried sweet plantains, and cabbage flecked 
with oregano accompany the fish. And with everything comes two triangles of 
festival bread -- a barely sweetened doughnut-like bun, which here, is 
uncommonly light. 
</P>
<P>
Del Rose serves a meaty curry goat and also ackee and salt cod. Ackee, a 
vegetable that's part of a large tree flower, reminds a lot people of scrambled 
eggs; the salt cod punctuates its mild taste perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
In characteristic Jamaican style, Del Rose's hours are unpredictable. The 
restaurant opens at 11:30 a.m. and closes about 8:30 or as late as 10 p.m. 
depending on the flow of customers and the supply of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Rose Act I, 2921 S. La Cienega Blvd., Culver City, (213) 558-9314. Open 
Tuesday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tastee Bakery and take-out, near the new Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw Shopping 
Center, is one of the latest additions to L.A.'s Jamaican scene. 
</P>
<P>
Like the name says, Tastee Bakery excels in traditional Jamaican baked goods. 
There's toto, a spicy, not-too-sweet cake with a dense, crumbly texture. Hard 
dough bread, a huge compact loaf of white bread makes spectacular toast. Meat 
"patties," the national Jamaican snack, are annatto-flavored pastries. While 
most Jamaican places have them, Tastee's are particularly thin and flaky. Even 
though they're flavored with fresh Scotch bonnet chile peppers, the spiced-beef 
filling is barely hot. Also try plantain tarts; gizada, a crispy coconut tart; 
Tastee's dense, sweet potato pudding; and the brilliantly-spiced Jamaican bread 
called bun. 
</P>
<P>
Hearty slabs of hard dough bread are the foundation of Tastee's Jamaican-style 
marinated roast beef sandwiches. A light, spiced sauce goes over the beef and 
leaves a chile afterglow in your mouth. Tastee also makes home-roasted, cold 
chicken sandwiches drizzled with savory pan juices. 
</P>
<P>
Drinks (non-alcoholic) are another Tastee specialty. Sorrel drink, a juice made 
from hibiscus flowers, is fruity and intense, and fresh ginger beer is deeply 
pungent. Fresh carrot juice is squeezed to order and served plain. (Most places 
blend it with condensed milk and spices into a sweet shake-like drink.) Irish 
moss, a concoction that tastes like a nutmeg milk shake is considered a 
Jamaican health drink. "It's a meal in a drink," says Tastee's owner, Lloyd 
Sinclair. 
</P>
<P>
 Tastee Bakery, 3907 Santa Rosalia Drive (west of Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw Plaza, 
off Stocker St.), (213) 299-9459. Open Monday through Saturday 8 a.m.-7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Universal Restaurant, also known as "Joe's," is a tiny place wedged between 
a fish store and an office building. There really is a Joe and he happens to be 
one of the best Jamaican cooks in town. His cowfoot stew is one of the most 
well-bred treatments of the dish I've ever eaten. A few tiny "boiled" 
dumplings, the size of blueberries, are blended in the stew's rich gravy; then, 
on the side is a large savory fried dumpling. Lima beans garnish the dish which 
comes with rice and peas. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not partial to cowfoot stew or even the peppery and wonderful oxtail 
stew, Joe's also offers stewed chicken, barbecued chicken and the usual 
curries. And he sells homemade Jamaican drinks: tart refreshing sorrel and 
thick creamy sour sop (guanabana fruit and sweetened milk) among them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Universal Restaurant (Joe's), 50 Santa Barbara Plaza (enter corner of 
Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. and Buckingham Rd.), Los Angeles, (213) 299-4511. 
Open seven days 11 a.m.-8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"When Jamaicans first come to town they go to Stone's to get the grapevine," 
one Jamaican told me. The bakery and take-out restaurant next to the 
18-year-old Stone Caribbean Market, has become a veritable institution for 
Jamaicans in Los Angeles. What's more, some of the best Jamaican bun in the 
city comes out of its tiny kitchen. (It's like gingercake and full of ginger, 
nutmeg and molasses.) 
</P>
<P>
Stone's also sells coco bread, meat turnovers and Jamaican-style carrot cake. 
And there's almost always a line of people waiting to pick up or order Stone's 
take-out dinners. These are listed on a blackboard behind the counter and vary 
daily. Usually they include copious servings of stewed chicken, short ribs, 
curry chicken or goat. All come with rice and peas, several strips of fried 
plantains and sometimes a vegetable or a leaden boiled dumpling (Jamaican 
dumplings are always like paperweights). And if ever there was a glorification 
of the lowly bean it is Stone's "stew beans," slowly simmered with cured beef. 
</P>
<P>
One note: Stone's is moving soon to larger quarters. A bright blue awning is in 
place, but the opening date is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone Bakery Co., 6700 Crenshaw Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 753-3847. Open 
Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Sunday until 7 p.m. New location 
scheduled to open at 6437 Crenshaw Blvd. 
</P>

By now Jamaicaphiles and barbecue seekers know all about Janet's Jerk Chicken 
Pit, a tiny restaurant specializing in meats dry-marinated in jerk seasoning. 
Most of the time, Janet's enormous open grill holds slabs of smoldering 
"jerked" flattened chicken halves, or chunks of beef and pork; their aroma 
hovers near the ordering counter ensuring you'll be starved by the time you 
reach your table. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's the chicken that has put Janet's on the foodie map, I am 
particularly partial to the jerked pork dinner. Beneath its spicy (but not 
really hot) seasoning layer, the meat is rich and juicy. You can also try jerk 
burgers, jerk fish, jerk ribs and jerk sausage links. And all the dinners come 
with a rather dense but good festival bread, plantains and two additional side 
dishes. Potato salad, rice and beans and yams are the best choices, and I'd 
definitely avoid the frozen "vegetables du jour." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet's Original Jerk Chicken Pit, 1541 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Los 
Angeles, (213) 296-4621 or (213) 296-4646. Open Monday through Saturday noon to 
9 p.m., 
</P>
<P>
Sunday 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The rum drinks at Jamaica West outshine every rum drink I've ever tasted in a 
neo-Carib restaurant (or, for that matter, any other bar). Fresh juices and 
particularly subtle blending give them an extra edge. 
</P>
<P>
Every Thursday evening the restaurant serves an all-you-can-eat Jamaican buffet 
from 5 to 10 p.m. It's best to come early to get the full effect of the spread: 
A whole poached seabass is decorated with cucumbers and tomatoes -- very plain, 
fresh and moist. Chaffing dishes are filled with curry goat, large plump 
Creole-style shrimp in a mild sauce, and oxtail with beans "cooked down 
tender," as they say on the Island. There's also red pea (bean) soup, vibrant 
with herbs and a little pepper, and jerk chicken -- good and smoky, but on one 
occasion, a little dry from being left out too long. 
</P>
<P>
One caveat: The spicing from this kitchen tends to be a bit played down, 
perhaps in deference to West Side tastes. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends Reggae disco and dancing begin at about 9 p.m., and after 10 p.m. 
there is a $5 cover charge. The charge is waived if you are dining, but 
reservations are required after 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamaica West Restaurant and Bar, 2205 Lincoln Blvd. (1 block north of Venice 
Blvd.), Venice, (213) 578-2926. Open for lunch Tuesday through Saturday 11 a.m. 
to 3 p.m., for dinner Tuesday and Wednesday 4 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., Thursday 5 
p.m. to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday 4 p.m. to midnight. 
</P>

The old Jamaica Royal restaurant has been taken over by new management; it's 
now called Hannah Towne Restaurant and Bakery. There's a small, comfortable 
dining room next door to the bakery take-out room, and the menu is fairly 
standard. There's curry chicken, curry goat, oxtail stew and braised short 
ribs. Although the restaurant's jerk chicken is baked rather than grilled, its 
hot and spicy flavoring and juicy meat was remarkably good. 
</P>
<P>
Hannah Towne is the only Jamaican place I've come across that bakes whole-wheat 
hard-dough bread. The bakery also turns out good gingery bulah cake, cinnamon 
buns, crispy coconut tarts and sweet potato pudding daily. The only problem is 
that the quality of the baking is uneven: Coco bread has been too yeasty at 
times, and the meat and vegetable patties have been too doughy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannah Towne Restaurant and Bakery, 4213 Crenshaw Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 
293-5044. Open 11 a.m.-9 p.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coley's, which has been in the same location for more than seven years, has 
recently been remodeled. Now the Crenshaw storefront is practically genteel, 
with a two-level dining room and pristine peach-colored tablecloths. 
</P>
<P>
Coley's side dishes demonstrate careful cooking in its kitchen. The rice in the 
rice and beans is always fluffy and subtly flavored. Festival bread is like a 
delicious dense little doughnut, and the vegetables are fresh and lightly 
steamed. A generous serving of curry chicken comes mildly spiced and is perfect 
with its fried sweet plantain. 
</P>
<P>
At dinner time, half of the items on the menu are fish or seafood. Coley's 
conch soup (served Fridays only) is superb. But I can't recommend the red 
snapper; the small, whole bony fish could have been fresher on the times I 
tried it. Other items have been carefully done, though. Shrimp patties -- just 
like meat patties only filled with potato and chunks of large shrimp -- are 
excellent. Coley's also makes the traditional beef patties, and patties with 
chicken or vegetable fillings. 
</P>
<P>
 Coley's Kitchen, 4335 Crenshaw Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 293-6930. Open Monday 
through Thursday 10 a.m.-9 p.m.; Friday through Saturday 10 a.m. to about 9:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not all Jamaican restaurant are meat-dominated. Jucy's, for instance, 
specializes in Ital vegetarian dinners (translation: "completely natural"). 
Unfortunately, the dinner I tried turned out to be a fairly mundane dish of 
carrots, potatoes, red beans and other vegetables stewed in coconut milk. A few 
greens, plantains and a rock-hard whole wheat dumpling (Jamaican boiled 
dumplings are almost always rock hard) accompanied it. The creamy peanut punch 
(like a peanut milk shake) was much better. And a small, whole red snapper was 
fresh and meaty. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the old-fashioned, robust soups that Jucy's does best. Thick, beefy 
cowfoot soup (available daily), is stick-to-your-ribs good, Jamaican 
grandmother style. On Tuesdays and Thursdays you can get fish soup; on 
Wednesdays there's chicken soup, and on Fridays beef soup. Jucy's Naturalart 
Jamaican Restaurant, 3426 W. Washington Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 737-9277 or 
732-8865. Open Tuesday through Saturday 11 a.m.-9 p.m.

I was new to Los Angeles when my agent set up my first meeting on the Paramount

I approached the gate. But I was finally sure I was in Hollywood when I 
received directions from the guard: "Drive straight down this road and park 
under the sky."

KFAC was my favorite radio station for 38 years, until Heifetz bought it in 
1986 and the programming became worse and worse. Never had I heard so many dull 
flute compositions.

<P>
Given the fact that she is the daughter-in-law of violinist Jascha Heifetz, I 
do not understand how she could preside over the decline of good music.

I enjoyed Weinstein's article, but, like many other writers, he doesn't seem to 
know what to make of Arsenio Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone seems to agree that Hall is a talented comedian; what no one points 
out is that he is also a very good reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the hosts of other talk shows, where the troublesome ghosts of Merv 
Griffin and Joan Rivers linger and guests are allowed to promote themselves 
endlessly, Hall asks questions. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere else will you hear Lisa Bonet explain her professional relationship 
with Bill Cosby and comment on her dismissal from "A Different World." Nowhere 
else will you see boxing champ Mike Tyson questioned in depth about his 
high-profile divorce and troubled youth.

Quite a brouhaha, what with enraged letters and long features in Calendar about

commercials after every selection?

There is an excellent alternative -- KUSC, which offers 21 hours daily of the

Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid fired Prime Minister Kasdi Merbah, but 
Merbah refused to step down, declaring the move unconstitutional. Merbah, who 
has been in office 10 months, announced his decision hours after Bendjedid 
dismissed him and asked a top aide, Mouloud Hamrouche, to assume the post and 
form a new Cabinet. Merbah had been charged with implementing sweeping reforms 
designed to transform Algeria from a one-party socialist state into a 
multi-party democracy. A political source said Bendjedid was frustrated at the 
slow pace of the implementation of political and economic reforms launched 
after rioting swept the country last October.

AH, WILDERNESS! RESERVATIONS NEEDED EVEN IN REMOTE NORTHWEST

ENCHANTMENT LAKES, Wash. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These sparkling alpine lakes live up to their name. Hikers often say they half 
expect to see an elf behind the next granite boulder or a gnome crouched under 
a lakeside larch. 
</P>
<P>
Wilderness ranger Elizabeth Goulet knows better. There is more likely to be 
another hiker behind that boulder, she says, and pile of trash under the tree. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment she's inspecting one careless camper's jetsam: 10 wrappers from 
freeze-dried meals, a penlight battery, a jar of instant coffee, an empty 
sardine can, a stove burner and a tube of bug repellent. 
</P>
<P>
Usually Goulet would be fuming, but today she's all smiles. The litterer also 
left an envelope with his name on it, so a Mr. Martinez soon will be getting a 
package in the mail -- his own trash, sent C.O.D. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Small Victory 
</P>
<P>
Rangers here in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness of the Cascade Range savor such 
small triumphs as they try to keep visitors from loving the wilderness to 
death. Few are as inconsiderate as Martinez, but sheer numbers take their toll. 
</P>
<P>
"It's becoming almost what we call urban wilderness," Goulet said. "We manage 
it so much for people that we sometimes lose sight of managing it for its 
wilderness value." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Forest Service has resorted to a permit system here to limit the 
number of campers in the Enchantments. 
</P>
<P>
It's part of a trend. National parks, which are managed for the benefit of 
visitors, have struggled for years with the balance between letting sightseers 
in and maintaining a place worth seeing. Wilderness areas, which have less 
human traffic and are managed less intensively, are catching up fast. 
</P>
<P>
A Colorado State University survey found that 28% of the 474 U.S. wilderness 
areas already limit recreational use via entry permits or time limits on 
camping, and others are considering such moves. Recreational use was declining 
at only 3% of the wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the growing Seattle area promises more pressure on the Alpine 
Lakes Wilderness, which already sees more visitors annually than Mt. Rainier 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very high outdoor ethic," Ron DeHart of the Forest Service in 
Seattle said. "People want to do more than look at the mountains. They want to 
get out in them." 
</P>
<P>
Many choose to do it at Enchantment Lakes, a small corner of the 306,000-acre 
Alpine Lakes Wilderness where a dozen crystal-clear lakes adorn a basin of 
glacier-scoured granite, all hemmed in by jagged peaks. In the basin's lower 
reaches are trees gnarled by the elements, meadows of heather and tarns with 
names like Talisman and Leprechaun. The upper basin is a haunting landscape of 
rock and snow. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows the area better than Bill Stark, 78, and his wife, Peggy, 72. They 
named many of the lakes and have come here every year since 1959 from their 
home in nearby Leavenworth. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first went up, it looked like nobody had ever been there," Bill Stark 
said. "Then we started seeing subtle signs of use. Then, not-so-subtle signs." 
</P>
<P>
Hikers tramped out a network of foot trails across the basin. Lush beds of 
heather were flattened and wads of toilet paper blossomed everywhere. "People 
are pigs," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1970s, a summer weekend could bring as many as 300 people into the 
basin, a less-than-enchanting situation for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
The Forest Service tried to minimize damage. Toilets were installed in 1966 and 
use of horses was restricted in 1972. Guided tours were banned in 1976 and 
dogs, which might chase wild animals or disturb other campers, were prohibited 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Booked Solid 
</P>
<P>
A permit system established in 1987 limits the number of campers to about 60 on 
any given day. The season runs from June 15 to Oct. 15, and summer weekends are 
booked solid within a few weeks after permit applications are accepted March 1. 
</P>
<P>
The permits detract from one value of having a wilderness: the opportunity to 
escape the regimentation of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
"Wilderness implies freedom, and you can't get that freedom with the permit 
system," Goulet conceded. "But you couldn't get it here anyway, because without 
the permits, there would be crowds of people." 
</P>
<P>
A few campers each week sneak in without permits, risking $50 citations from 
one of the five rangers who patrol the Enchantments, but most visitors seem to 
respect the aim of the permit system. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a really special place. Whatever it takes to keep it special is worth 
it," said hiker Hal Zimmer, 39, who was on his seventh trip to the 
Enchantments. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Merkel of Philadelphia said his partner waited in line two hours at the 
Leavenworth ranger station to get one of the few permits reserved for "walk-in" 
business. 
</P>
<P>
But Merkel doesn't mind, considering the alternative: "There would be people 
all around the place. You might as well be at the Jersey shore." 
</P>
<P>
The permit system is working, Goulet said. The crowds are gone, so rangers have 
a chance to start replanting some eroded, overused campsites. 
</P>
<P>
It is still not Goulet's idea of true wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate wilderness would be taking an unaffected area and blocking it off 
to everybody," she said. "I wouldn't have to go see it -- just knowing it was 
there would be enough, knowing that there was an area we haven't messed up." 
</P>
<P>
But there is also value to an "urban wilderness" like the Enchanted Lakes, she 
said, "a place where people can sense what the land was like before we got 
here."

 While environmental groups have been fighting government and development 
interests during the 25 years of the Wilderness Act, a little-known private 
group has quietly put aside nearly 4 million acres of ecologically important 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
In its 38 years, the Nature Conservancy has saved threatened lands ranging from 
343 square miles of rare New Mexican desert grassland to a heron feeding ground 
on nine-tenths of an acre of Connecticut marsh. 
</P>
<P>
And, with a well-endowed war chest and a proven track record, the nonprofit 
Arlington, Va.-based group now saves land at an average of 1,000 acres a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Get Into Fights 
</P>
<P>
The Conservancy's success is due in part to an organizational credo. It will 
not fight developers in court or seek a public forum to save private land. It 
remains neutral in skirmishes involving government, environmentalists and 
business interests, using a checkbook and persuasion rather than lawyers and 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to describe ourselves as the real estate arm of the conservation 
movement," Bill Weeks, the Conservancy's chief operating officer, said. "That 
role has been changing, but we still will look to market-based solutions rather 
than regulatory solutions." 
</P>
<P>
The Conservancy's proven techniques and changing role are evident here in the 
Carrizo Plain, 180,000 acres of beautifully empty grasslands 150 miles north of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Carrizo, home to such endangered species as the kit fox and blunt-nosed 
lizard, was purchased after the Conservancy put together such unlikely partners 
as state and federal agencies, the oil industry, ranching interests and 
conservation groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservancy is involved in an ambitious new project to reintroduce native 
grasses, elk and antelope, pushed out in the past by farming and cattle 
grazing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Native Grass Sprouting 
</P>
<P>
"Grazing ended this April, and the native grass is already coming up," preserve 
manager Chuck Warner said, standing in an emerald green island of native rye 
grass surrounded by the dusty brown, lunar landscape. 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy has acquired nearly half of its land through standard 
real estate deals. Although much, including the Carrizo, is turned over to 
state or federal stewardship, the Conservancy owns and manages the world's 
largest private nature preserve system, with nearly 1,000 preserves. 
</P>
<P>
Other land targeted by the Conservancy is protected through conservation 
easements and other agreements with landowners around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"They have done a superb job over the years," said Charles Miller, a National 
Wildlife Federation spokesman. "There is sometimes a lot of controversy within 
the conservation community over which way to proceed in an issue, but the 
Nature Conservancy just goes in its own direction and does something that is a 
fantastic service." 
</P>
<P>
The organization began in 1946, when a special committee of the Ecological 
Society of America split off to form the Ecologist's 
</P>
<P>
Union, renamed the Nature Conservancy in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days, the group's main goal was to take undisturbed lands out of 
circulation. Its first purchases were financed by mortgages on the homes of 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the group has parlayed donations, grants and business acumen into 
an $85-million fund and a national organization with 540,000 members staffed by 
more than 1,000 part- and full-time organizers and naturalists. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservancy finds land to protect through its Natural Heritage Program, a 
joint venture with state governments to inventory and save the habitats of 
endangered plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We look for habitats or ecosystems that are particularly threatened," said 
Steve McCormick, director of the California Nature Conservancy. "If you wait 
until a species is on the endangered list, that usually means its habitat is 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Entire Company 
</P>
<P>
Deals can be complicated. To save a Long Island osprey nesting ground, the New 
York chapter had to purchase an entire real estate company, complete with 
Manhattan brownstones and Florida warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
When the owner of a Virginia barrier island wanted his land developed instead 
of conserved, the Conservancy purchased it through a dummy development company. 
</P>
<P>
"It created some public relations problems with the people here because they 
felt we were sneaky," said Barry Truitt, manager of the Conservancy's Virginia 
Coast Preserve. "We didn't use any tactics that aren't used by developers, but 
I guess, because we're conservationists, they expect our standards to be 
higher." 
</P>
<P>
Some land is donated. Bob Butler, a Kennebunk, Me., furniture store owner, gave 
the Conservancy a 12-acre parcel along the Kennebunk River. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want it ever to be developed, but then someone offered me a deal I 
could barely refuse," he said. "I gave it up so I wouldn't be tempted again." 
</P>
<P>
Butler was so impressed with the Conservancy that he went on to serve as 
chairman of its Maine board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Make Land Swaps 
</P>
<P>
The Conservancy offers other deals. It will take land in exchange for other 
properties and lifetime annuities. It will pay for conservation easements to 
keep land out of development. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it sponsors a program to tell people how to protect endangered 
species on their property. 
</P>
<P>
"Landowners usually are surprised and delighted that they have something rare 
on their land, and they become advocates," McCormick said. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservancy's non-confrontational stance has put it increasingly in the 
role of mediator, as when local officials and developers fought 
conservationists and government agencies over the habitat of the Coachella 
fringe-toed lizard, a tiny reptile that survives only in the special sands of 
the Coachella Valley in the hot real estate market around Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Set Up Lizard Preserve 
</P>
<P>
After months of negotiations and $2 million in Conservancy seed money, the 
parties agreed to a 13,000-acre preserve. Developers will pay a $600 mitigation 
fee for each acre of lizard habitat that is developed outside the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Selzer, a attorney for some developers, said the Conservancy was able to 
show that setting the land aside served everyone's interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Another environmental group in the process could have made it more difficult," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
McCormick said that the bitter controversy was eased when developers saw that 
their holdings would be enhanced by the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
"Attitudes change," he said. "The developers thought of environmentalists as 
people with a weird interest in a strange animal. Now they see it as a question 
of quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Invading Plants Removed 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the role as mediator, the Conservancy has become more involved 
in restoration. At its Blowing Rocks Preserve on Florida's Jupiter Island, 
"exotics," non-native trees like the Australian pine and Brazilian pepper, have 
been cut to halt their encroachment on indigenous species and the fragile dune 
ecology. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become clearer that not only species but whole biological systems are 
threatened," Weeks said. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservancy is taking greater steps to protect those systems through 
agreements that limit the use of adjacent lands. At the Virginia Coast 
Preserve, the Conservancy has negotiated with neighboring landowners to control 
development pressures on the fringes of the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
"We once thought we were going to be establishing nature preserves that would 
exist apart from society," Weeks said. "Now, we've come to feel the integration 
of these nature preserves with the fabric of the society around them is 
critical."

Federal inspectors appointed by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins will visit 
nuclear weapons plants in Tennessee, Texas and Ohio over the next five weeks to 
check for compliance with environmental and safety rules, Watkins said. The 
investigations are part of a broader effort by Watkins to identify 
environmental and safety problems at the 17 major weapons plants owned by the 
department and to attempt to reassure Congress that known flaws are being 
corrected. The plants earmarked by Watkins for special investigations are the 
Pantex weapons assembly plant at Amarillo, Tex.; the Y-12 plant in Oak Ridge, 
Tenn., which processes uranium and other nuclear materials, and the Mound plant 
near Dayton, Ohio, which produces detonators and other components for nuclear 
weapons.

IT'S A BUG-EAT-BUG WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
FIRMS SUPPLY FARMERS WITH 'GOOD' INSECTS TO CHEW UP THE 'BAD' ONES

<P>
For Jack Blehm and son, it's a bug-eat-bug world. 
</P>
<P>
Jack and Jake Blehm breed good insects to eat bad insects at Rincon Vitova, one 
of a group of 15 insect firms nationwide. Every day, Rincon produces more than 
80 million voracious critters from ladybugs to wasps. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers concerned about effects of pesticides are turning to organic 
alternatives, and business at Rincon Vitova has tripled in the last five years. 
In 1988 alone, the Blehms said, they supplied millions of dollars worth of bugs 
to customers on three continents. 
</P>
<P>
The close-knit group of insect firms have sales that total $25 million 
annually, the Blehms estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Most insects are sold to cotton and vegetable growers, as well as to back-yard 
farmers who want to avoid pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
The low-tech bio-pest control is the latest rage in pest eradication. It was 
first used by the Chinese thousands of years ago and was in vogue in the late 
19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
And the idea is catching on again. Some campuses are adding classes on 
integrated pest management. The Assn. of Applied Insect Ecologists, a trade 
group, is producing a video that shows farmers how to work with beneficial 
insects. The state Department of Agriculture approves of the low-tech method. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the future," added Ken Hagen, a professor of entomology at UC 
Berkeley. "There is a great need. The farmers are desperate." 
</P>
<P>
State agriculture officials estimate that less than 10% of California's growers 
use the method. Controlling pests this way takes longer, and because pesticides 
kill good bugs along with bad, farmers are forced to stop chemical spraying 
while waiting for the good bugs to do their job. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing for the farmer is to have enough faith," Jake Blehm said. 
"He's not used to seeing pests in the field; he's used to a quick knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
"With this method, you have to watch for several weeks before you see a 
difference. And at the beginning, all the farmer sees is that his crop is 
contaminated with bugs." 
</P>
<P>
Rincon Vitova began in 1948 and today sells 15 species, including beetles, 
mites and parasitic wasps that help control flies at chicken and livestock 
ranches. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Blehm, a licensed pest-control adviser, provided the business and 
production expertise. His partner, E. J. Dietrick, an entomologist formerly 
with the biological control division at UC Riverside, provided the field 
know-how. 
</P>
<P>
They took their name from Rincon Beach, where they first set up shop, and 
Vitova Insectaries, a Riverside-based firm they bought in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Business has grown steadily for Rincon Vitova, which today sells about 5% of 
its bug crop to universities and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The firm employs about 40 workers during the peak season, from April to 
September, and houses its offices in cottages along railroad tracks. The bugs 
hang out in a series of former ship-cargo containers. 
</P>
<P>
Rincon Vitova even sells bugs to movie makers. Last summer, a studio filming a 
horror movie placed a request for four gallons of maggots. "We shipped them 
Federal Express to their location site in Montana," Jake Blehm said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 600 species of beneficial insects have been introduced into American 
agriculture in the last century to curb pest populations, according to the 
USDA, which must approve the insects for use before the firms breed them.

BUT CRITICS WARN OF A GLUT ON THE MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
IOWANS SAY OSTRICH-FARMING WON'T LAY AN EGG AS THEIR PROFITS SOAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WESTSIDE, Iowa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big Jim the ostrich hunkered down and, in what has become a daily ritual, 
curved his long neck into an S-shape and waved it from side to side. Sally, the 
focus of his attentions, batted her long eyelashes and looked away. 
</P>
<P>
The courtship of these ostriches isn't very private. When Big Jim performs his 
dramatic mating dance, Iowa farmer Dick Hugg watches and smiles. At $3,000 a 
chick, ostrich breeding is serious business. 
</P>
<P>
The birds deliver offspring promptly and punctually. Every other day between 
4:30 p.m. and 5 p.m., Sally lays an egg, and the Huggs -- between growing corn 
and soybeans and feeding hogs -- head out to the ostrich pen to pluck an egg 
and place it in an incubator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taller Than Cornstalks 
</P>
<P>
Ostriches in Iowa? At 8 and 9 feet tall, these 300-pound African birds stretch 
higher than cornstalks and cause double-takes among Hugg's neighbors in this 
conservative German farming community. 
</P>
<P>
But Hugg, along with an estimated 100 farmers in the Midwest and 200 in Texas 
and Oklahoma, see ostriches as the salvation of a distressed agricultural 
economy unable to support the more traditional soybean, grain, beef and pork 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the brightest picture on the agricultural scene today, and it's going to 
stay that way," said Oklahoma rancher Dale Coody, who owns 60 ostriches and 
wrote "Ostriches, Your Great Opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, agriculture is in trouble, and this is the surest way out of 
trouble that I know of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enough Profit for a Pizza 
</P>
<P>
It was 1975 when Dick and Doris Hugg realized that they could not earn a living 
from cattle. After raising 180 head, marketing them and rushing the cash to the 
bank to pay off their note, "we had just enough left over to buy a pizza," Hugg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So the Huggs, and others who survived a farm crisis that left many bankrupt, 
sought ways to diversify. Some got hooked on ostriches, and, according to many 
who invested, are making huge profits. Iowa farmer LeRoy Kaufman said he earned 
more than $100,000 in 1987 by raising and selling the birds. 
</P>
<P>
Ostrich breeders are confident that they can carve a niche in American 
agriculture for the marketing of ostrich feathers, hide and meat. "We foresee 
it eventually being a commercial business, much like turkeys or chickens or 
hogs, where they'll be routinely raised for slaughter," Hugg said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low-Cholesterol Meat 
</P>
<P>
Ostrich meat, popular in Europe, is a red meat one-third lower in fat and 
cholesterol than beef. Ostrich promoters have dubbed it the health meat of the 
'90s. "We'll have ostrich burgers someday," Hugg said. 
</P>
<P>
But ostrich filets and ostrich-skin bucket seats are at least seven years away, 
according to Tom Mantzel, executive director of the Texas-based American 
Ostrich Assn. This country's ostrich population, estimated at 6,000 adults, is 
not big enough to support a slaughterhouse, so the current market is for 
breeders only. 
</P>
<P>
The birds are hard to come by and command a high price. An adult mating pair 
costs $35,000 to $60,000, and an unusually prolific pair can carry a $75,000 
price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Ostriches, particularly attractive to breeders because of their reproductive 
habits, lay 35 to 100 eggs annually for 40 of their 70 years of life. 
</P>
<P>
Even at high prices and with the birds' high reproductive rate, breeders say 
they cannot meet the demand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made Profit in 85 Days 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman said that 85 days after he bought a few birds in 1987, he recouped his 
$15,000 investment and pocketed a $25,000 profit. "I've made more dollars here 
than I ever did in farming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is so optimistic. Fred Thornberry, a poultry specialist at Texas 
A&amp;M University, called the enterprise speculative and warned prospective 
breeders not to jump in hastily. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, like so many once-promising ventures in agriculture, such as the 
failed rabbit-harvesting craze in Texas several years ago, this one could fall 
dead in its tracks. "This is not an industry as yet, and I would be very 
cautious (about) investing money I could not afford to lose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornberry, who has received more than 600 ostrich-related queries from farmers 
across the country, said that profits probably peaked in 1987. The farmers who 
bought birds at low prices in 1986 and earlier will pocket the highest profits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population Explosion Seen 
</P>
<P>
What makes the venture especially risky for incoming breeders is the likelihood 
of an ostrich population explosion this year, which could cause prices to 
plummet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hundreds of chicks hatched in 1986, the year the ostrich movement picked up 
speed, will begin reproducing this year. "I think we're approaching the point 
where it's getting riskier and riskier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Huggs do not expect an imminent population explosion, because 
raising an egg to a full-grown ostrich is a difficult task that most breeders 
have yet to master. 
</P>
<P>
Baby ostriches are frail and die easily. And, because ostriches are a new 
agricultural frontier, farmers do not quite know how to raise birds that can 
run 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Feeding them is not such a problem. Ostriches, said to eat anything, are 
usually raised on prepared alfalfa pellets with some grain and other 
ingredients mixed in. The Huggs feed them lettuce and cabbage also. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Male Turns Dangerous 
</P>
<P>
Sally and Big Jim, which are kept inside a 5-foot wire fence, exhibit distinct 
personalities, the Huggs said. She is always docile. He is, too, unless it's 
mating season, when he turns cantankerous and downright dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
In mating season, males are reputed to be able to kill with a kick, and the 
Huggs stay out of the pen, using a cane to retrieve eggs from the nest. "He 
doesn't like people messing with his eggs or his girl," Hugg said. 
</P>
<P>
Most breeders are able to hatch 60% of their eggs, and the Huggs' hatch rate 
runs about 80%. They attribute their success to a labor-intensive operation and 
a willingness to do whatever it takes to hatch a chick and help it grow. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if a chick has trouble cracking out of its egg, the Huggs help it 
along with pliers. 
</P>
<P>
Breeders expect U.S. ostrich prices to be buoyed should the Department of 
Agriculture permanently ban importation of the birds from Africa. The 
department temporarily embargoed ostriches in June, when ticks not indigenous 
to the United States were found on incoming birds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breeders Back Import Ban 
</P>
<P>
Some breeders prefer an import ban, so they can build the ostrich population 
from birds already here. Once the pool is high enough to support a processing 
plant, breeders see a virtual fail-safe enterprise, because every part of the 
bird is usable: feathers for computer dusters, ceremonial plumes and fashion 
wear; leather for boots, purses, car seats, egg shells for jewelry and meat for 
health-conscious consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Whitaker, a Kansas banker and owner of 40 ostriches, said he has 
received letters from a Swiss company expressing interest in ostrich meat 
produced here, because South Africa controls the industry and does not export 
enough to meet Swiss demand. "They can't get enough of it in Europe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique's restaurant in Washington used to offer ostrich meat but 
discontinued it, because "it was not appreciated."

CLUJ, Romania

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a languid Sunday in this once-glorious European city, a foreign car is the 
center of attention as it pulls into the long evening shadow of the medieval 
cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
People stare from a safe distance, mindful of laws that mandate the reporting 
of any unauthorized conversations with foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
A father leans over to his son, muttering, in English, that the man behind the 
steering wheel is a "driver." 
</P>
<P>
A bolder spirit, a well-dressed woman, approaches the strangers, asking in 
flawless French if they will change some money. She retreats crestfallen back 
into the shadows when they refuse. 
</P>
<P>
In a nearby cafe, a waitress wearily explains to the foreigners that there are 
no snacks, no coffee, no tea and no mineral water, a familiar scenario across 
Romania today. 
</P>
<P>
Just soc (colored water that tastes of chemicals), she says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsmiling Guests 
</P>
<P>
An aging band grinds out slow, almost bluesy versions of Hungarian ballads as 
unsmiling guests drown any sorrow in barely audible chatter and free-flowing 
"cognac." 
</P>
<P>
Romania 1989: a European country where European visitors are an object of 
suspicion for authorities and mute curiosity for friendly but frightened 
citizens, a polyglot nation where European cultures blended for centuries and 
now vanish behind official intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
In Cluj and other towns, stylish but shoddily built apartments sprout in record 
time, while old villages crumble away, depopulating "naturally" as their lone 
stores and schoolhouses are closed. 
</P>
<P>
Across the fertile land, rationing is in force and food stores grow more bare 
with each year of the vaunted "golden era" of President Nicolae Ceausescu. Yet 
officials spouting statistics about Romania's advances on the march to Utopia 
blandly assure foreigners that the meat they cannot see on shelves is 
available, just stored in refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, the fifth in a row of government-imposed energy rationing, six 
Communists who once held senior posts implored Ceausescu to change course. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Move Romania to Africa 
</P>
<P>
"Romania is and remains a European country," they insisted in a letter that 
later reached the West. "You started changing the geography of the countryside, 
but you cannot remove Romania to Africa." 
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old Ceausescu, the visibly healthy and unchallenged ruler since 
1965, swiftly squashed the protest before it had any chance of spreading to 
other party members. 
</P>
<P>
According to Western diplomats in Bucharest, the six were repeatedly 
interrogated. Refusing to recant, three were exiled outside the capital and the 
three others were removed from comfortable homes into rougher quarters in the 
city. Police guards reportedly prevent diplomats from approaching the new 
abodes. 
</P>
<P>
Mircea Raceanu, the adopted son of one of the six and a senior diplomat who 
served six years in the United States, was arrested and charged with treason as 
media articles and rallies rammed home the dangers of contact with foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows where Raceanu is, and a question about him clearly rattled 
officials at a news conference during the Warsaw Pact summit in Bucharest in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Professor Disappeared 
</P>
<P>
Authors of other protests share this anonymous fate, according to Romanian 
emigres and Western diplomats. Former Cluj university professor Doina Cornea 
has not been seen since June 6, following her third protest letter to 
Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
Writers Andrei Plesu and Mircea Dinescu were under virtual house arrest after 
penning protests, while another writer, Dan Desliu, spent two weeks in a 
Bucharest asylum for his dissent. 
</P>
<P>
And the march to Utopia continues, cutting deep into the peasant traditions of 
Romanians, and into the culture and mutual tolerance nurtured for centuries by 
1.7 million ethnic Hungarians and 200,000 Germans in the rolling hills of 
Transylvania. 
</P>
<P>
In German villages, freshly painted lettering over courtyard gates proudly 
proclaims the family of the owner, and the date the house was built. In Cluj, 
Hungarian-language theater and other cultures still thrive, to judge by posters 
advertising the events. 
</P>
<P>
But the city's Hungarian Consulate was closed last year in the escalating war 
of words between Bucharest and Budapest, whose traditional rivalry over 
Transylvania is exacerbated by sharp ideological divisions over the future 
shape of communism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vestiges of Tradition 
</P>
<P>
A Cluj schoolteacher now in Hungary, one of thousands of such refugees from 
Romania, tearfully recalled how efforts to preserve vestiges of Hungarian 
tradition in class were slowly eroded by reprimands and the appearance of more 
and more Romanian-speaking pupils. 
</P>
<P>
Transylvania's ethnic Germans, hard-working farmers who have tilled the fertile 
soil for centuries, are fleeing the country at the rate of 13,000 to 15,000 a 
year -- and would go faster if Romania let them. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of endangering this emigration once muted West German protest at Romania's 
human rights record. Now, Bonn is as outspoken as other capitals. Emigration 
has not suffered, diplomats say, but the wife of the West German consul was 
brutally kicked and beaten by a uniformed policeman on a Bucharest street this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu is isolated, too, from most Eastern bloc nations. To visitors, but 
not in articles, Soviet journalists based in Bucharest make plain their 
distaste for a familiarly Stalinist government. They say they are watched and 
harassed by Romania's KGB, the dreaded Securitate, but insist that open 
hostility would only ruin relations and any chance at helping to shape the 
country's future. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu appears to firm believe that his brand of Stalinism offers more 
social security and Marxist equality than Mikhail S. Gorbachev's topsy-turvy 
reforms in the Soviet Union or Hungary's open dash toward free elections and a 
free market economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surreal Statistics 
</P>
<P>
As proof, his supporters cite surreal statistics -- that living standards are 
135 times higher than in 1945, that 675,000 new apartments are available under 
this Five-Year Plan, that industrial investments will increase 30% and the 
annual harvest surge from 30 million tons to 40 million tons a year by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Failing to mention the cost in shortages caused by food exports from this 
bountiful land, Romanian officials boast of their unique feat of repaying the 
entire foreign debt, $11 billion, from 1980 to last March. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers have noticed no improvement in the stores since. But their diet of 
propaganda proclaims proudly that, for the first time in its turbulent history, 
Romania is beholden to no one. 
</P>
<P>
Credit for all this goes to Ceausescu, who is the object of a strong 
personality cult and has installed several close relatives -- including his 
wife, Elena, son, Nicu, and brother, Ilie -- in powerful positions. 
</P>
<P>
The draft program for a November party congress describes him as the "most 
beloved son of the Romanian people, the man of genius and architect of modern 
Romania." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wonderful Achievements' 
</P>
<P>
"We can and must assert most powerfully that only socialism could make such 
grandiose and wonderful achievements of our nation possible," Ceausescu 
insisted at a Communist Party meeting in June. 
</P>
<P>
Private ownership, small farms and the encouragement of profit-seeking 
entrepreneurs, he emphasizes, are not communism. Neither are "any attempts to 
denigrate socialism." 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats in Bucharest say Ceausescu cites the massacre of 
pro-democracy demonstrators in China or the deaths of protesters in the Soviet 
city of Tbilisi as evidence that his policies are correct -- he does not kill, 
so therefore criticism of Romania over human rights is misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
Given the grip of the Securitate, and the disappearance of the leaders of a 
spontaneous protest by 10,000 workers in November, 1987, it seems unlikely that 
popular unrest will erupt. 
</P>
<P>
Romania has weak democratic traditions -- a favorite proverb has it that "a 
stooped back cannot be broken by a sword" -- and outside influences that might 
stir mass protest are few. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Trips Abroad 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu, once an inveterate traveler courted in the White House and 
Buckingham Palace as a communist maverick, has made no trips abroad this year, 
and receives no top visitors from the West these days. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats report that even Romanian officials and intellectuals once 
permitted carefully reported contacts with foreigners have all but stopped 
attending embassy parties. 
</P>
<P>
There are no Western or even Soviet bloc newspapers broadly on sale, and 
imports -- and hence contact with Western businessmen -- are dwindling now that 
fresh foreign credit has been outlawed. Romanian TV works two hours a night on 
a heavy diet of Ceausescu, and the more interesting offerings from Bulgarian, 
Yugoslav, Soviet or Hungarian television can be received or understood only on 
the nation's fringes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just becoming a dinosaur of a country, if you like," says a Western 
diplomat who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
A Romanian official counters, "We had to cut ourselves off." 
</P>
<P>
"When you're getting beaten from all sides, you withdraw to a place where it's 
safe," he adds, smiling. "We'll see who's right." 
</P>

OFFICIALS SEEK WAYS TO END GENERATIONS OF POVERTY;

<P>
MISSISSIPPI DELTA LABELED 'AMERICA'S ETHIOPIA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The lower Mississippi River region is so poor that one section is called 
"America's Ethiopia," and a federal commission is seeking new ways to help its 
dying towns and end generations of dependence on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
There are counties with more than one-quarter of the work force idled, a lack 
of capital to attract new jobs and waste of human resources, such as teen-age 
mothers with sickly babies and adults who cannot read or write. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a foreign country in need, the region of 214 counties in seven states 
covered by the study gets neither enough sympathy from Washington nor bailouts 
from international financiers, said Wilbur Hawkins Jr., executive director of 
the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice, well and dandy to take care of foreign nations," Hawkins said. "But 
here we are in America -- we can afford to send money to Poland, to the 
Caribbean nations, but not to the Delta." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lack of Care' 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lack of care about the Delta's problems, a lot of unconcern," said 
one commission member, Rep. Ed Jones (D-Tenn.). "I think the Southern people 
are concerned, and now it's time for the nation to be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The commission members represent Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee and are appointed by the states' governors. 
Congress assigned the commission to come up with a 10-year plan for government 
and private action to lift the region out of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Geographically, a river's delta is at its mouth; the Mississippi's is the area 
below New Orleans where it spills into the Gulf of Mexico. But Congress, noting 
common problems of the mostly agrarian poor counties stretching from southern 
Illinois to the tip of Louisiana, grouped the seven states under the common 
heading of "Delta" in creating the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The region has long relied on agriculture, river commerce and industries that 
have suffered because of overseas competition. The river is lined by rich 
farmland and dotted by small waterfront towns, like Helena, and a few 
population centers, like Memphis, Tenn., which have some prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 million people in the region, 40% fall below federal poverty 
guidelines, according to Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Below Poverty Level 
</P>
<P>
More than half the residents of northwestern Mississippi's Tunica County, which 
earned the "America's Ethiopia" nickname, live below the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
Across the Mississippi at Lee County, Ark., the per capita income is $6,542. 
The hospital was closed for lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
At Lakeview, Ark., south of Helena, rampant teen-age pregnancy prompted 
distribution of contraceptives at the school health clinic -- but the program 
was curtailed for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
One stumbling block to national action is a lack of awareness about the Delta, 
Hawkins said. During a recent meeting in Washington, Hawkins said he asked why 
more federal contracts go to Puerto Rico than Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Puerto Rico is just as American as Mississippi,' " Hawkins quoted an 
official as responding, "then in his next breath, he said: 'What can you make? 
What can you do?' " 
</P>
<P>
The swampy land lining the Big Muddy was drained and pioneered by plantation 
owners over the last century. Rich in deep topsoil and natural resources, poor 
in capital, the Delta counts agriculture as its dominant industry. 
</P>
<P>
But wealth never trickled down from the landowners; residents, many of them 
sharecroppers, stayed poor and got poorer with the changing fortunes of 
farming, which has a reverberating effect in the little-diversified economy. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's preliminary proposal for a 10-year improvement plan, to be 
presented to Congress in October, was compiled during the last six months. It 
runs more than 70 pages and is packed with new statistical data, Hawkins said. 
The congressional mandate calls for a final report in May, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins also said the mandate bars any release of details until Congress gets 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
But long-time Delta residents say the region's problems can be boiled down to 
one word: money. Money to attract jobs, train workers and battle conditions 
that smother hope and erode families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scouted Site 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins recently scouted Phillips County for a site for the commission's 
late-summer meeting in Arkansas. At Elaine, as he walked down a gravel road 
toward time-worn houses, he was surrounded by curious youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"What are y'all doing this summer?" Hawkins asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing," replied 12-year-old James Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins hoisted another child, 2-year-old Bryant Hart, into his arms. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make his tomorrow better. That is what this is about," he said. 
"You ask what this boy's life is going to be like -- this is the future 
generation. His future depends on the success of what we do."

LAW LEAVES MANY WORKERS UNPROTECTED; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS TAKES A NEW LOOK AT PENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT P. HEY, Christian Science Monitor 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 76 million working Americans expect that, when they retire, they will 
collect income from the private pension plans to which they now belong. But 
will there be enough money in the pension funds? 
</P>
<P>
Most will collect their money, but some may not. Nobody knows how many, not 
even the government, which is supposed to supervise large pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
Until 15 years ago, only 3% of workers enrolled in pension plans ever received 
benefits. Then a federal law, usually called the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974, was passed to remedy that situation. It was supposed to 
require federal supervision of the majority of private pensions. 
</P>
<P>
But there are questions as to how well the law is working, and Congress is 
investigating the issue. No one wants to risk returning to the days when few 
pension promises were kept. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Law Protects 40 Million 
</P>
<P>
Today, 40 million workers -- slightly more than half of all members of private 
pension plans -- will get their retirement money one way or another. The 
federal government guarantees that through its Pension Guaranty Benefit Corp. 
If the plans do not have enough money, the government will step in to keep 
retirement payments coming. 
</P>
<P>
The government does not guarantee the plans of nearly 36 million other workers. 
These include the plans of firms with fewer than 26 employees, church 
organizations and professionals such as law firms and medical groups. If these 
pension plans lack the resources to meet their obligations, payments to their 
retirees will be reduced or stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Pension experts generally believe that most private pension plans are 
financially sound, well administered and will be able to make all the 
retirement payments promised to current and future retirees. 
</P>
<P>
But some pension plans are questionably administered and on shoddy financial 
footing. Others are looted by the people who are supposed to administer them, 
according to the inspector general of the Department of Labor and individuals' 
complaints to the Pension Rights Center, a private agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missing Assets 
</P>
<P>
No one knows how many plans are endangered by dubious practices, but two years 
ago, the inspector general examined a number of pension funds and discovered 
that 0.3% of their assets was missing. If that figure represented an average 
for all private plans, the total would be "$4 billion in misused assets," Rep. 
Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) said. Lantos is chairman of the House Subcommittee on 
Employment and Housing, which has just opened hearings on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee is trying to figure out how to tighten the supervision of 
pension plans, to make sure that their administrators obey federal law and have 
enough money to meet their obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Maria, acting inspector general of the Labor Department, said there are 
two fundamental problems with the department's system of overseeing the large 
pension plans. One is that the annual audits by independent accountants, 
required by the law, too often fail to turn up problems with the administration 
of a pension plan. Maria recommended that auditors conduct more thorough 
investigations and be required to report any irregularities to both the Labor 
Department and to workers covered by the plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Criminal Cases 
</P>
<P>
The second problem, he said, is that the Labor Department has been reluctant to 
bring criminal charges. He calls this an "institutional resistance to pursue 
criminal sanctions." Maria wants Congress to pass a law that would require the 
Labor Department to return to the inspector general's office the freedom to 
pursue criminal investigations of nonunion pension and welfare plans.

<P>
A Seventh-day Adventist couple was convicted Friday of third-degree murder in 
the starvation death of their 14-year-old son during a six-week religious fast. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member jury deliberated for an hour and 45 minutes over two days before 
finding that Larry Cottam, 39, an unemployed truck driver and former 
Seventh-day Adventist minister, and his 38-year-old wife, Leona, failed in 
their parental duty to provide food for their children. 
</P>
<P>
Luzerne County Judge Gifford Cappellini denied the prosecution's motion to 
increase bail, which is set at $50,000 each. However, the judge stipulated that 
the Cottams' defense lawyers must see them in person at least once a week to 
observe them and make sure they "are maintaining a proper level of existence." 
</P>
<P>
The panel of seven women and five men also found the couple guilty of two 
counts each of recklessly endangering another person and endangering the 
welfare of children for neglecting to feed the son, Eric, and his 12-year-old 
sister, Laura. 
</P>
<P>
The family began its fast in November and Eric died of starvation Jan. 3 at his 
Nuangola home. Laura Cottam has been in the care of foster parents since her 
discharge from the hospital in February. 
</P>
<P>
The Cottams could each be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison on the murder 
charge and up to eight years in prison for the other offenses. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Eric's death, the Cottams had $3,700 in cash and savings, which 
they told authorities they could not use to buy food because it was for God.

FULLERTON FALLS TO USC IN WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Fullerton women's volleyball team lost to USC, 15-3, 15-13, 15-4, 
on Saturday in the Collegiate Premiere tournament at the Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton won its first three games of the tournament but lost Friday to San 
Diego State and Saturday to USC and did not place in the tournament. Fullerton 
now has a 4-3 record for the season. 
</P>
<P>
California defeated UC Santa Barbara 15-5, 13-5, 15-6, 8-15, 15-5, to win the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Outside hitter Rachel Wittliff, a freshman, led Fullerton with eight kills. 
Sabrina Dennis, who was named to the All-tournament team, and and Anne 
Witkowski each had five digs for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>

OCEAN VIEW'S OFFENSE TAKES TO THE AIR, DEFEATS SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
It was hard to imagine Ocean View High School's offense struggling to average 
12.3 points per game last year after watching the Seahawks amass 336 yards in a 
24-7 victory over Saddleback on Saturday night in Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View got offensive in its season opener with junior quarterback Randy 
Karliner passing for 222 yards and two touchdowns. Karliner completed 14 of 24 
passes, including touchdowns of 44 and 76 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback quarterback Paul Delgado also went to the air often, with the teams 
attempting 51 passes combined. Delgado completed six of his opening seven 
passes, including one for a six-yard touchdown to wide receiver Robert Reyes 
that put Saddleback ahead, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
But Saddleback had problems generating much offense after the first quarter, 
turning over the ball four times on two fumbles and a pair of interceptions. 
Ocean View linebacker Mitch Dallas recovered both fumbles, and Scott Caringella 
and Greg Johnson each had an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View tied the score, 7-7, early in the second quarter when Karliner 
teamed with fullback Quincy Bennett on a short screen pass that Bennett turned 
into a 44-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, Ocean View increased its lead to 14-7 when Karliner threw 
another short pass to slotback Ben Cesar that resulted in a 76-yard touchdown 
play. Cesar, the Sunset League's 100-meter sprint champion as a junior, outran 
three defenders to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Karliner had 181 yards passing by halftime but 140 yards came on two plays in 
which he didn't throw the ball more than 10 yards to either Bennett or Cesar. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View put the game out of reach in the third quarter. John Arnold kicked a 
30-yard field goal for a 17-7 lead and then reserve running back Jason Merkel 
scored on a four-yard run after Dallas' second fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback gained only 16 yards rushing and 69 yards passing in the second half 
as the Roadrunners' traditionally strong ground attack never materialized. 
Tailback Tony Colthirst led Saddleback rushers with 36 yards on six carries. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado, making his varsity debut, completed 11 of 27 passes for 120 yards but 
connected on only four passes in the second half. Orange Lutheran 26, Pater 
Noster 12 -- Gil Greene rushed for 263 yards on 18 carries and scored three 
touchdowns to lead host Orange Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, who also had an interception, scored on touchdown runs of nine, 59 and 
60 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran (1-0)) controlled the game from the second quarter, when Roger 
Pagani's four-yard touchdown run capped a nine-play, 76-yard drive. After a 
short punt, Greene quickly made it 13-0 with his nine-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran had 314 yards rushing to 58 for Pater Noster. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 17, Santiago 14 -- Marc Broadbeck's 31-yard field goal with 4:44 
left gave Laguna Hills the victory at Mission Viejo. Darrin Chapman and Mark 
Mitchell scored Laguna Hills' touchdowns. Kevin Gillian scored twice for 
Santiago.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: CRUISING FOR SOME CARIBBEAN GOODS 
</P>

CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bargain-hunting among cruise passengers in Caribbean duty-free ports has become 
so popular that many vacationers are designing their itineraries around 
shopping, with St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands leading the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
St. Thomas, about 1,000 miles southeast of Miami, is easily accessible by 
airplane and cruise ship. The island's capital, Charlotte Amalie, is one of the 
Caribbean's busiest ports and a center of commerce. The town, with hundreds of 
chic and well-stocked shops, is a bargain-hunter's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on liquor, perfume, sweaters, woolens, famous-maker clothing, 
accessories, jewelry, china, crystal, linens and other luxury goods are usually 
at least 20% below mainland retail. 
</P>
<P>
Although prices are standardized throughout the island, some shops have bigger 
selections or different brands, and, since shops are constantly competing 
against each other, they frequently feature unadvertised sales that cut already 
discounted prices by up to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. citizens who have been abroad at least 48 hours may bring home up to $800 
worth of duty-free purchases from the Virgin Islands (including St. Croix and 
St. John, as well as St. Thomas), including one gallon of alcoholic beverage, 
plus one extra fifth of an alcoholic beverage produced in the Virgin Islands. 
That's double the duty-free limit (and more than double the amount of liquor) 
allowed from other foreign destinations. 
</P>
<P>
The Virgin Islands is a U.S. protectorate (bought in 1917 as guard posts for 
protection of the Panama Canal), hence the larger duty-free allowance. The 
islands, discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493 and taken over by Denmark 
in 1666, have had several cultural influences. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Amalie, so named by the Danes in 1691, still has its colonial 
ambience. Warehouses that centuries ago stored the booty of Capt. Kidd, 
Blackbeard and other pirates, now house fashionable shops. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 general stores and specialty boutiques are clustered among Charlotte 
Amalie's historic buildings along Main Street (or Dronnings Gade, which is 
Danish for Queen's Street), Waterfront Highway and Back Street (or Wimmelskaft 
Gade), between the post office and market square. Browsing through town yields 
a pleasant blend of bargains and background. 
</P>
<P>
Brochures about shopping, as well as maps, bulletins on promotions and discount 
cards for some shops, are given free at the airport or by cruise directors. 
</P>
<P>
On Main Street, head first for A.H. Riise, the island's finest general store. 
Top luxury labels include Bing &amp; Grondahl and Wedgwood for porcelain, A.C. 
Bang furs, Hilda Icelandic woolen sweaters, Liberty of London scarfs and ties, 
Crabtree &amp; Evelyn soaps, ilias LALAoUNIS jewelry and many more designer 
giants, all sold at about 20% off mainland retail prices. 
</P>
<P>
Riise's liquor department has everything from expensive imports to cheap 
unknown labels of whiskey (from $2 per fifth), Scotch (from $3 per fifth), 
vodka (from $3 per fifth), brandy (from $4 per fifth) and more. 
</P>
<P>
If you're taking advantage of your full liquor allowance at Riise's or other 
shops, have purchases delivered directly to your ship or flight. Most shops 
offer this service free. Six fifths of liquor are heavy, and you don't want to 
lug them around all day. 
</P>
<P>
A. H. Riise Gift Shop Alley, just off Main Street, features Riise's less 
expensive gift and souvenir items. The alley also has many small specialty 
shops, including Lion in the Sun, a terrific big-name boutique with exceptional 
prices on attire by Yves Saint Laurent, Sonia Rykiel, Kenzo, Yohji Yamamoto and 
other designers, plus superb hand-silkscreened T-shirts. Designer dresses cost 
$50 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Bolero and Sparky's, both well-stocked Main Street general stores, issue 
discount cards (at airports, from cruise directors or by writing to the stores 
with the date you'll be in port) for 10% off all merchandise, including already 
low-priced liquor and special sale items. 
</P>
<P>
Bolero's specializes in inexpensive prepackaged rum selections ($26 for five 
fifths). Sparky's, known for inexpensive liquor, also sells discounted cameras 
and photo equipment, but before buying them, do some comparison shopping at 
Royal Caribbean (the Main Street shop, not the cruise line), which has a bigger 
selection usually priced about $10 less per item. 
</P>
<P>
Little Switzerland, the famous chain of general stores with branches throughout 
the Caribbean, has three outlets on Main Street. Its stock includes a little 
bit of everything made by name designers, including Orrefors and Lalique 
crystal, Aynsley, Villeroy &amp; Boch, Wedgwood and Royal Doulton china, plus 
fine jewelry, watches and other luxuries, all sold for at least 20% less than 
mainland prices. 
</P>
<P>
Main Street boutiques include Riviera with Diane Freis dresses (for about $300, 
40% below mainland retail), Pringle cashmere sweaters, English woolens, Missoni 
and Hermes silk ties, Ted Lapidus shawls and more. 
</P>
<P>
Gucci and Louis Vuitton have Main Street boutiques. The Leather Shop sells 
Bottega Veneta and Fendi leather goods. Prices are 20% to 30% less than 
mainland retail. 
</P>
<P>
Tropicana Perfume Shop's two Main Street outlets have the island's biggest 
selection of fragrances, including American-made scents, at duty-free prices. 
</P>
<P>
Main Street jewelers include Cardow, with appealing discounts on Piaget and 
Swatch watches (the latter from $20) and with lovely three-carat diamond 
bracelets (about $1,900). 
</P>
<P>
H. Stern's two Main Street shops show extensive jewelry selections. The Jewelry 
Vault's styles are similar to those at H. Stern, but lower prices include 
impressive sapphire and diamond rings for as little as $500. 
</P>
<P>
In Palm Passage, an exclusive esplanade that runs between Main Street and 
Waterfront Highway, Cartier sells Les Musts staples at up to 30% less than 
mainland list.

MEETING A DIFFERENT KIND OF CRUISING CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA P. GUSTKE, Gustke is a free-lance writer living in San Jose. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cape Horn may seem like an odd destination choice for a cruise, but for my 
husband and I it was the culmination of a longtime dream. 
</P>
<P>
We'd first talked about it in the halcyon days of our youth, when we labored 
together sailing our Star boat. We made the promise again and again, while 
sailing on San Francisco Bay or in the warm waters of the Caribbean. But 
raising a family, business responsibilities and then a progressive muscular 
disease I contracted delayed the plans. 
</P>
<P>
What fun, then, to find that we could make this voyage by cruise ship, on the 
Royal Viking Sky. For even though years had passed, the desire to "round the 
Horn" had not. 
</P>
<P>
It presents the same challenge to a sailor as Mt. Everest does to a climber. 
And the 20,000 miles we covered getting there and back was a wheelchair saga 
that left me feeling as adventurous as a Magellan or Chichester. 
</P>
<P>
Even on the Sky, with its radar and satellite position finder, there's still no 
promise of seeing this rugged sentinel that marks the boundary between the 
Atlantic and Pacific oceans, just 600 miles from Antarctica. The itinerary 
cautiously says "weather permitting," and we knew that on the previous cruise 
it had been too rough to attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Well, we were lucky. The gods and nature smiled on us, for we did fulfill our 
promise on a dark and forbidding morning. Rising at 5:30, hoping for an early 
glimpse of this rocky island, my husband Bob headed to the deck bundled up like 
a sailor from clipper ship days. 
</P>
<P>
That's the captain in him, and he stayed on deck every cold moment until the 
Horn was far behind us. 
</P>
<P>
I, as the imaginary first mate, was delighted to discover that our promenade 
deck windows looked out at exactly the same vista. So I did my rounding of the 
Horn, snuggled into my warm bunk, sipping hot coffee from my bed tray, happily 
aware that for me, at least, the luxurious ship offered a lot more comfort than 
a 45-foot sloop. 
</P>
<P>
En route to Cape Horn, we first visited friends in Santiago, then flew to Rio 
for a Royal Viking pre-cruise stay. Our two-week cruise was slow-paced, with 
stops in Santos, Montevideo, Puerto Madryn (near a nature preserve on the 
Patagonian coast), a transit of the Strait of Magellan, then on to Ushuaia, the 
most southerly city in the world, Cabo de Hornos and a leisurely four-day sail 
back up to Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
What we did and what we saw in the course of those 20,000 miles would make a 
good itinerary for anyone. We just happened to do it with me sitting in my 
wheelchair. The special difficulties we faced and the special efforts we had to 
make showed our South American neighbors our true desire to learn about their 
countries and their cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-planning: In wheelchair travel it's best to accept the fact that there will 
be problems. But advance planning can minimize them. Our travel agent contacted 
Royal Viking Lines, explaining my medical problems (muscular dystrophy) and the 
fact that I needed full-time use of a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
I followed this with a personal call to again alert the cruise line that I 
could not climb steps; that's important because buses are the normal mode of 
shore transport. Many passengers have lesser mobility problems, using a chair 
just as an aid, so it's necessary to let them know that you're a "permanent 
occupant." 
</P>
<P>
Select the best cabin you can afford -- it means more space, a larger bath, 
wider hallways. I cut corners on my grocery budget for months to splurge on the 
promenade deck because of the scenic view from its big windows. I love to watch 
the constant parade of walkers, joggers and strollers. 
</P>
<P>
Try for mid-ship location, close to an elevator. Make your dining room 
selection well in advance. We prefer a table for two by the window, but you may 
have to beguile the maitre d' once aboard to get one. 
</P>
<P>
Arm yourself with what reading material you can find. There are good general 
books on South America, and Royal Viking provides excellent shore excursion 
descriptions ahead of time, as well as daily sightseeing highlights in their 
on-board newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Airline reservations should be made early. Again, try to budget for business- 
or first-class. Buenos Aires to San Francisco is a long flight, and the comfort 
of reclining chairs and leg room was invaluable. I gave up shopping for gems in 
Rio and furs in Buenos Aires, and it was a good trade-off. 
</P>
<P>
If flying tourist-class, request bulkhead seating. You'll be boarded first and 
deplane last. And the wonderful passenger agents will become instant best 
friends; they know all the elevator secrets and usually whip you through 
customs so fast that agile passengers enviously eye your wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
If you arrive a day or two early to rest up before your cruise, all the better. 
And if you can break a long trip with an overnight, consider that, too. Be 
prepared for any kind of carry-on and carry-off if there's not a jetway. 
</P>
<P>
You're not in the United States, with its super equipment, and loading and 
unloading can vary from traumatic to harrowing, especially when another 
language is involved. We always ask for the special narrow chair that airlines 
are supposed to have, but I've finally learned to close my eyes, pray and hope 
the men who carry me are both strong and sure-footed. 
</P>
<P>
As for toilets, use the terminal bathrooms (or perhaps an employee or 
restaurant bathroom if you're lucky). Bob has to lift me, so we enter a deux in 
any ladies room (occasionally even a men's room) and no one seems to mind. 
Sometimes I use the bathroom on board before takeoff or at landing (no motion 
and safer.) 
</P>
<P>
Since the dimensions of a plane toilet are designed for anorexics, we try to 
avoid our lifting routine there since it leaves both of us face to face with 
barely enough room to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
I limit liquid intake for 24 hours before a trip, drink very sparingly during a 
trip and, on our last trek, I tried atropine, under my doctor's instructions. 
It actually absorbs liquid within your body, and I managed 8- to 10-hour trips 
(aloft and on tours) without needing comfort stops. But use it only under a 
doctor's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Another advance task is packing. All of my clothes go on a metal hanger with a 
plastic bag. Bob has to cope with my unpacking, and I try to keep him happy at 
all costs. It's much easier, too, especially in a 30-inch case. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings me to the last bit of pre-planning advice: a physically able 
traveling companion. That's in the ship's rules, and I'm lucky mine is trained 
as an engineer, a gentleman and a banker. 
</P>
<P>
Once aboard: Yes, there are still things to do aboard. Cruising is a wonderful, 
relaxing way to vacation, far less tiring than land travel, but you won't find 
perfect access, even on the five-star Royal Viking Lines. Of 600 passengers, 
there were three of us in wheelchairs and probably 25 to 30 others who had 
mobility problems. 
</P>
<P>
Learn the floor plan of the ship. With its blueprint in mind, there's literally 
no place that is off-limits to you. The easiest access to the promenade deck 
was through the Finlandia bar, with waiters willing to open the door and assist 
at the two steps. Bob soon discovered a special toggle switch on the elevator 
panel that held open the door for safe loading. 
</P>
<P>
If you're headed for a floor show, arrive early; there's no such thing as a 
subtle entry by wheelchair. Even the beauty shop was designed so I could stay 
seated. Our favorite spot was the Discovery Lounge on the top deck, with its 
stunning view of the sea and beautiful harp music at the tea and cocktail 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Shore excursions: These can be difficult if you can't manage bus steps. Our 
mentor was the director, Sigrid Scatliffe, who always knew what was possible. 
We decided early on that we needed a private car and guide, which she arranged. 
But know in advance that you must be flexible. 
</P>
<P>
Debarking at a wharf is relatively simple, but at anchor it can be difficult. 
My greatest desire was a catamaran ride at the Beagle Channel, and they somehow 
did load me. 
</P>
<P>
It must have looked exciting, too, because when the crew finally deposited me 
and the chair inside, I was greeted by a round of applause. But I really didn't 
know if we could do it until minutes before. 
</P>
<P>
If you plan pre- or post-trip excursions, let them know that you'll need taxis 
rather than buses. And arrange touring with your own car and guide. It costs 
more but you learn more. I always let hotels know my special needs: the 
Sheraton in Rio and the Plaza in Buenos Aires were wonderfully helpful to us. 
</P>
<P>
The personal touch: You may not have time for a Berlitz course, but do at least 
try to learn the words for "wheelchair," "elevator," "help" and "steps." And 
especially "thank you." Fortunately, I am fluent in Spanish, but it was great 
fun learning these words in Portuguese. And my obrigada (thank you), 
accompanied by a gracious smile, made the difficult job of lifting a happier 
experience. It was often more important than the tip. 
</P>
<P>
I consider it the personal responsibility of any "wheelie" traveler to put 
others at ease. Somehow, coping with a wheelchair leaves onlookers tongue-tied. 
I find I often have to initiate conversation to let them know that my 
disability does not extend to my brain, thankfully. 
</P>
<P>
And I find room in my luggage for my best-looking clothes. Somehow, people 
connect wheelchair users with hospital gowns, and I take great delight in 
donning chiffon, sequins, paisley shawls, gold lame -- whatever makes me look 
and feel stylish. 
</P>
<P>
But underneath this finery must be a will of steel, for often it's a fight 
every inch of the way to get where you want to go. So develop a "politely 
aggressive" attitude, never be afraid to ask others for help, remember to be 
flexible and above all, retain your sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
I pack my sense of humor every day, long before I dress, and it solves most of 
the problems of being "physically challenged." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the only flat entry into the very elegant Plaza Hotel in Buenos 
Aires happened to be in a loading area for the legumbres (vegetables). Somehow, 
it gave us a great chuckle to roll in right along with the "tomates, lechuga y 
zanahorias" (tomatoes, lettuce and carrots) that would appear in our dinner 
salad at the famed Grill that evening.

SIMPLE PLEASURES ON THE HOOD CANAL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spend time with transplanted Pacific Northwesterners and, sooner or later, one 
of them will start to rhapsodize about Washington state. You know -- the 
rhododendrons are lush, the houses are cheap, the people are real, the quality 
of life is. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently beyond description, because the phrase usually ends in a wistful 
sigh. 
</P>
<P>
But don't dismiss Washington worship as an utter exaggeration until you've 
visited Hood Canal. Spend a few days there at the foot of the Olympic 
Mountains, eating oysters on the beach to the barking of the harbor seals, and 
you'll know why so many Californians seem ready to trade perpetual sunshine for 
frequent drizzle. 
</P>
<P>
The canal, named for an 18th-Century British admiral, is not a man-made canal 
but a narrow, fiord-like arm of Puget Sound, the enormous body of water that 
shears the Olympic Peninsula from the rest of Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
Hood Canal, 60 miles long and an average of about two miles wide, stretches 
from Port Ludlow on the north to Potlatch on the south, then takes a short 
northeasterly hook toward Belfair. 
</P>
<P>
By California standards the canal is uninhabited, even in summer. Sail or motor 
over the smooth expanse of protected blue water, the glacier-covered peaks of 
the Olympics towering above you, and yours is likely to be the only boat in 
view. 
</P>
<P>
Choose a chunk of waterfront from among dozens of oyster-strewn beaches; you'll 
be the only one there. 
</P>
<P>
For hikers, Olympic National Park is just minutes away by car. Mt. Olympus 
rises 7,965 feet in the center of the park, surrounded by more than a dozen 
slightly lesser peaks. Hundreds of miles of trails meander through remote rain 
forests and along mountain streams: the Quinault, the Dosewallips, the Elwha 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
People with wet suits brave the 45- to 55-degree temperatures and water ski in 
the canal. Because of its isolation from ocean currents, the water is rarely 
choppy. On the warmest days in the summer, children swim -- without wet suits 
-- in some of the shallow, sheltered coves. 
</P>
<P>
Others journey to Hood Canal for skin diving. Some of the largest octopuses in 
the world, weighing as much as 90 pounds and with arm spans of up to 18 feet, 
have been collected in the waters of Puget Sound. Watching a giant Pacific 
octopus emerge from a two-inch crack in a rock is said to be one of the more 
memorable scuba-diving experiences. 
</P>
<P>
But for me, the main reason to visit Hood Canal is to eat. The place is a 
paradise for seafood lovers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oysters Piled Three Deep 
</P>
<P>
The last time we were there, in late June, we took a 12-foot motorboat up the 
canal, about a mile and a half from our resort, and pulled up at a beach where 
the oysters were piled two and three deep. 
</P>
<P>
Turquoise water lapped at the shore. As it receded at low tide we saw obese 
purple and orange sea stars, milky white sea anemones and clumps of bearded 
black mussels. Clams spat at us through holes in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
Our children spent the morning gathering miniature green, red and brown hermit 
crabs. There are said to be 27 species of hermit crabs in the Puget Sound area, 
and the kids must have found all of them. 
</P>
<P>
The four adults present -- my parents, my husband and I -- gathered our legal 
limit of oysters (18 per person) within minutes. We shucked them on the spot 
(it's illegal to remove oyster shells from the beaches), motored back to the 
resort with our oyster catch in plastic bags and pulled up the three crab nets 
we had put down earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Three large orange dungeness crabs and five smaller, red-and-brown rock crabs 
were making a meal of the quartered chickens we'd tied inside the rings as 
bait. 
</P>
<P>
That night we sauteed oysters and boiled crab in the kitchen of our cottage for 
dinner. We made another oyster run the next morning, this time staying long 
enough to dig for clams, too. The crab nets were full again on our return. 
</P>
<P>
Day 2's menu was oyster stew for lunch and steamed clams and pasta with clam 
sauce for dinner. My brother made crab omelets for everyone the following 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
We had cracked crab, fresh from the crab pots, again for dinner on Day 3. 
</P>
<P>
Though others golf, we ate our way around Hood Canal. There are courses at the 
Alderbrook Inn &amp; Resort in Union, where we stayed, and at the Resort at 
Port Ludlow in Port Ludlow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two-Hour Trip 
</P>
<P>
Although Hood Canal is just 20 miles west of Seattle, getting there from the 
Seattle area takes a couple of hours. The Bremerton peninsula and widest part 
of the sound separate the two. 
</P>
<P>
Your choices are to take Interstate 5 south from Seattle, a circuitous and not 
particularly scenic route that winds around the southern end of Puget Sound 
through Tacoma and Olympia -- about a two-hour drive. Or you can drive onto a 
ferry in Seattle and get off in Bremerton. From Bremerton it's a short drive to 
most destinations on the canal. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations on and near Hood Canal range from cheap to reasonable. We've 
stayed at the Sunrise Motel &amp; Resort in Hoodsport, a funky two-story 
building right on Washington 101. What it lacks in architectural distinction it 
makes up for in price, convenience and view. 
</P>
<P>
Two-room suites with kitchens and balconies overlooking the canal start at 
$49.50. Double rooms start at $39.50. There's a pier for tying up boats and 
dropping crab pots. The beach at Potlatch State Park is a couple of miles 
south. A trail entrance to Olympic National Park is a few miles west. 
</P>
<P>
The pricier Alderbrook Inn Resort, just off Washington 106 at the southernmost 
tip of Hood Canal, can more legitimately call itself a resort. Its 18-hole golf 
course and nearby tennis courts offer a stunning view of the Olympics; a 
full-size swimming pool, enclosed in a tropical plant-filled greenhouse, sits 
right on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a sauna, hot tub, Ping-Pong/video game room, restaurant and bar. A 
lawn by the beach has a swing set for kids. There's free moorage at the pier 
for guests. 
</P>
<P>
The motel units at Alderbrook, which start at $72 for a double room in the 
summer, are unexceptional. A better bet are the two-bedroom cottages that sleep 
six or more. These start at $110 in summer. If you can, get one of the two on 
the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
One warning: At all costs, avoid Alderbrook on weekends. On our last trip we 
stayed there Monday through Saturday. Until Friday afternoon we had the place 
practically to ourselves, and it was idyllic. But starting at about 4 p.m. 
Friday, herds of people arrived. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dreadful Band 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward a dreadful live band began playing loud rock 'n' roll on the 
balcony in the main lounge. It continued until 1 a.m. Our quiet Northwest 
retreat turned into a singles bar. 
</P>
<P>
For campers there are sites at Kitsap Memorial State Park, Belfair State Park 
and Twanoh State Park on the eastern shore of the canal, and Potlatch State 
Park and Dosewallips State Park on the western shore. 
</P>
<P>
If you're after oysters, clams, crabs or mussels, choose a campsite on the 
eastern shore. There's less convenient road access to those beaches, and the 
shellfish are therefore less picked over. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative: Camp in the national forest and take day-trips to Hood 
Canal. The Staircase Recreation Area is the campground closest to Hood Canal. 
</P>
<P>
The weather, we've found, is much nicer than Washingtonians would like us 
Californians to think. Along with your favorite shellfish recipes, pack 
sunscreen.

TRIP OF THE WEEK: RUSTIC LODGING AMID THE TOWERING REDWOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE GRIMM and TOM GRIMM, The Grimms are Laguna Beach free-lance 
writers/photographers and authors of the updated Away for a Weekend.

BOULDER CREEK, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you want to sleep out in the woods but don't have a tent, consider spending 
a night or two at Big Basin Redwoods State Park. 
</P>
<P>
That's where 36 tent cabins were erected earlier this year, the first such 
accommodations offered in any California state park. If the rustic lodgings 
prove to be popular, tent cabins may be built in other state recreation areas. 
</P>
<P>
It would be difficult to select a more appealing site for this pilot project. 
The campsites are in the midst of a primeval forest of awe-inspiring trees: 
coast redwoods that soar higher than 30-story buildings. 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, citizens got together to save the age-old trees 
from covetous lumbermen and help establish California's first state park. 
Members of the Sempervirens Club campaigned for funds and a legislative bill 
that created California Redwood Park in 1902. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the 3,800-acre preserve has been expanded to more than four times 
its original size to protect some of the most pristine stands of redwoods on 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
80 Miles of Trails 
</P>
<P>
The park is a haven for nature lovers, who can explore by foot, horseback and 
bicycle. After entering the hilly park via a winding, paved road, visitors can 
roam along 80 miles of scenic trails. 
</P>
<P>
Near the park headquarters is the popular Redwood Trail that circles past some 
of the largest and most interesting coast redwoods in the Big Basin area. Pay 
25 cents for a self-guiding brochure to this flat, half-mile loop trail that 
has numbered sign posts for 11 points of interest. 
</P>
<P>
At No. 6, step inside the Chimney Tree, a living redwood with a burned-out 
center that opens to the sky. Also stop at No. 9 to gaze up at the 329-foot 
Mother of the Forest, the Big Basin's tallest redwood. A neighboring tree, 
Father of the Forest, is estimated to be at least 2,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
During this short walk in the woods you can listen and look for the noisy 
Steller's jay, acorn woodpecker, Oregon junco and other birds. Also keep your 
eyes open for black-tailed deer and chipmunks. Raccoons often are seen between 
dusk and dawn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flora and Fauna 
</P>
<P>
Camp out for a night or two to enjoy more of the park's flora and fauna. Try 
one of the new canvas tent cabins equipped with two double beds and foam-rubber 
mattresses. A lantern and wood-burning stove for heat also are provided. The 
cozy 12x14-foot tents have screen windows with flaps that can be closed privacy 
or on cool nights. 
</P>
<P>
Each campsite includes a picnic table and barbecue grill. Piped-in drinking 
water, hot showers and flush toilets are close by. Tent cabins rent for $29 a 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Bring your own sleeping bags or bed linens, or rent a linen package ($9) that 
has two sets of sheets, pillows, pillow cases and blankets. Deposits are 
required for rental linen and the tent lantern. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve accommodations by calling Mistix toll-free at (800) 444-7275. Tent 
cabins will be available daily until the rainy season begins in mid or late 
October, then on weekends only until March or April. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No RV Hookups 
</P>
<P>
Call the same number for reservations at the park's four campgrounds, where 145 
family camping spots are available all year. The nightly fee is $10; no RV 
hookups. Hikers can bed down in primitive trail camps for $2 per person a 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The day-use fee for picnicking or parking in Big Basin Redwoods State Park is 
$3 per vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers and docents lead walks in the woods almost daily in summer and on 
special occasions during the rest of the year. Inquire at park headquarters for 
tour times. 
</P>
<P>
At the eastern edge of the park you can mount up at Western Explorations' Big 
Basin Stables for a trail ride through the redwoods. The 2 1/2-hour horseback 
excursions leave the corral at 9:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. every day except Monday, 
through October. They resume again in May. 
</P>
<P>
The relaxing outing costs $35 per person. Novice to advanced riders are 
welcome; minimum age is 10 years. Call (408) 438-4226 for reservations. Groups 
of eight or more can arrange dinner or Sunday brunch rides or overnight trail 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
A mountain bike touring company called Dusty Roads also offers guided rides 
through the park. The last tours of the season were on Labor Day, but they will 
begin again next May. Call (408) 973-9299 for a brochure of biking itineraries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nature Lodge Museum 
</P>
<P>
Near park headquarters, be sure to visit the Nature Lodge, a museum featuring 
natural history exhibits. One display explains why redwoods are so resistant to 
fire and disease. You'll also see mounted examples of the birds and animals 
found in the 17,000-acre park. 
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to the museum is a general store with picnic supplies and a gift shop 
with redwood bowls, coasters and other souvenir items. Guests staying in the 
tent cabins register at the gift shop. After closing hours, guests register 
with the host at Huckleberry Campground. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about Big Basin Redwoods State Park, call (408) 338-6132. 
</P>
<P>
Get to the park from Los Angeles by driving north on U.S. 101 to San Jose and 
exit onto California 17 south. Exit west onto California 9, an official State 
Scenic Highway that goes through Saratoga to join California 236. 
</P>
<P>
This is a beautiful but narrow and curvy road that heads southwest into the 
park. (Not recommended for long RVs and vehicles with trailers.) 
</P>
<P>
An alternative route is to exit U.S. 101 and pick up California 1 to Santa 
Cruz, then take California 9 north to Boulder Creek to join California 236, 
which is wider and less winding when it enters the park from the east. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Big Basin Redwoods State Park via the latter 
route is 784 miles.

This is in response to Peter Greenberg's article on frequent flier rewards. 
</P>
<P>
Check the classified ads daily and you will find rewards for sale even though 
the rules state they cannot be sold, transferred or bartered. The government 
should investigate this. It should also tax rewards just like a domestic 
ticket, at 8%. And tickets should be examined at check-in just like a passport 
and the passenger denied boarding if he isn't the person listed on the ticket. 
Maybe it will take a little longer to check in, but the next time Greenberg 
wants to use his 90,000 for a European vacation, the seats will be available.

The Williams River does not flow through Ludlow. At least it didn't flow

After reading the article "Why Frequent Fliers Are Frequently Denied" (Savvy 
Traveler, Aug. 20), it strikes me as strange that you would allow such a poorly 
researched and biased article to be published. 
</P>
<P>
The article naively indicates that (Peter) Greenberg expected to pick up the 
telephone and have a free seat available on the flight and day of his choice, 
apparently on very quick notice, since he indicated that the response he 
received from TWA was that "seats might not be available until October." 
October was less than six weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
I have accumulated in excess of 1 million miles in one airline's frequent-flier 
program and also travel extensively on other airlines. I find all of the 
airlines to be courteous and helpful in assisting me.

LONDON IS TICKET TO AWARD-WINNING THEATRICAL EVENTS 
</P>

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If theater is your hunger, London is your horn of plenty. 
</P>
<P>
No city on Earth approaches its vitality, variety or number of offerings. More 
than 40 major venues show first-rate dramatic comedy and musical productions 
daily. There are almost 50 smaller fringe and pub theaters, many featuring 
celebrated performers keeping their craft honed. 
</P>
<P>
The thespians range from Rex Harrison, Alec Guinness and Maggie Smith to 
striving young beginners. 
</P>
<P>
The theaters run a gamut from the fascinating Royal Haymarket, founded in 1720, 
to the National Theater and Royal Shakespeare Company in their newer homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Haymarket hosts its own ghost, the NT and the RSC are technically state of 
the art. London's Savoy was the first theater in the world to be lighted by 
electricity, in 1881. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the creations of Shaw, Wilde, Gilbert and Sullivan, Coward and other 
vintage standards of the English-speaking stage made their debuts in London 
playhouses. To visit any of these mellow auditoriums is to commune with theater 
history. 
</P>
<P>
At houses such as the Criterion, Her Majesty's and Drury Lane, yesteryear's 
graces glow in the architecture and ambience of plaster scrolls, red plush, 
escutcheons on royal boxes and woodwork of rich patina. 
</P>
<P>
The intervals between acts mean amiable interludes at etched-glass bars. In 
all, a theater experience in London is a thoroughly civilized outing, rooted in 
a deep English tradition and affection for the stage and its people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Piccadilly Circus 
</P>
<P>
No leading theater is far from West End hotels. In the Piccadilly Circus 
environs alone are seven major houses. Six others are only a short walk away. 
The Royal Shakespeare, in the "City" neighborhood, and the National Theater 
across the Thames, are usually just a few minutes away by bus, Tube or taxi. 
</P>
<P>
Most London theaters will accept phone reservations as long as 24 hours ahead, 
with tickets about $25 tops. The client must then appear an hour before the 
performance to pick up the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
At Leicester Square is a special ticket booth at which one may buy 
reduced-price, same-day tickets for many of the shows -- from noon for 
matinees, 2 p.m. for evenings. Word of these bargains has spread, thus the 
queue is long. 
</P>
<P>
Booking in advance is recommended for RSC and NT plays, as most of their 
offerings are heavily subscribed. A few same-day tickets are made available 
before 10 a.m. at both RSC and NT box offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stratford-on-Avon 
</P>
<P>
With scant doubt, the Royal Shakespeare and the National are the world's most 
respected theater companies. The RSC was founded in Stratford-on-Avon more than 
100 years ago, and its showcase at Shakespeare's birthplace is still a mainstay 
of the town. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of people have thrilled to its productions, and noted actors such as 
Olivier, Gielgud, Finney and Burton refined their art on its stages at 
Stratford and London's Old Vic. 
</P>

The RSC's London home is a fine new theater in The Barbican, a massive 
apartment and cultural center in the East End. Some of its international 
successes in recent years (in addition to a continuing repertory of 
Shakespeare) have been "Educating Rita," "Nicholas Nickleby" and "Les 
Miserables." 
</P>
<P>
The National Theater parallels the RSC's popularity with more emphasis on 
venerable works other than The Bard, plus modern classics and experimental 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
The NT operates three theaters at its South Bank complex: the large, open-space 
Olivier, the traditional-proscenium Lyttelton and the smaller, adaptable 
Cottesloe. Its stagings run from "Guys and Dolls" and Chekhov, Shaw and O'Casey 
to Coward, Ayckbourn and contemporary American dramatists such as Neil Simon 
and Sam Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Shows Popular 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most popular shows on the London boards are U.S. musicals such as 
"42nd Street," "Kiss Me Kate" and "South Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
Among the city's best theater bargains are its ubiquitous pub and fringe 
offerings. Typical of these is the Kings Head in the Islington area. The shabby 
Edwardian saloon is a favorite hangout for colorful folks and is host to one of 
London's oldest and most active fringe theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, you see star actors from the RSC and NT in lunchtime or evening 
efforts by new playwrights. Prices are reasonable for tickets, pub grub and 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
For the most dedicated aficionados, London now boasts a Theater Museum in 
Covent Garden. It is a remarkably rich harvest of theater memorabilia from 
Shakespeare to Harold Pinter, displaying costumes, manuscripts, posters, 
playbills, props and other items spanning the prolific centuries of the British 
stage.

HER WORLD: SETTING SAIL FOR POLYNESIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In Tahiti there is a law -- or at least an enforced tradition -- that hotels 
should not be higher than a palm tree. I thought of that when the gleaming 
sails of the Wind Song unfurled silently as we left Papeete harbor. 
</P>
<P>
We were not a hotel, of course, but certainly more than a yacht. And those 
square-rigged sails, on masts reaching 204 feet above the waterline, were not 
only higher than a palm tree but higher than the tops of some cruise vessels 
sometimes sighted in these South Pacific waters. 
</P>
<P>
From the volcanic hills of Huahine to churchyards on Raiatea, the tall masts 
were the landmark I used to find my way back to the dock after a ramble on 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
I had not visited French Polynesia in several years, and always before by air. 
Approaching from the sea stirs up wild visions; lagoons slowly grow more blue, 
reefs more fearsome, mountains more craggy. Natural ridges and ramparts 
resemble the man-made fortresses of medieval Europe -- of Carcassonne or San 
Marino. 
</P>
<P>
Islanders who gather for the Wind Song's weekly call claim that the approaching 
ship creates equally entrancing illusions: its size and a silhouette changing 
under rain showers, or sunsets or a full moon. 
</P>
<P>
I peered from the porthole of my cabin as we tied up on Raiatea. Schoolgirls 
with ponytails were jumping a long rope and chanting the cadence. Barefoot boys 
were pushing hoops along the pier. And, straight ahead, the town square was 
curtained in bright cotton: the blues and greens, the reds and golds of native 
pareus. 
</P>
<P>
The pareu is an eminently useful garment, the boldly printed sarong of 
Polynesia, which also serves as a loincloth for men. It is a piece of cloth 
about four feet by six that can be used as a curtain, a tablecloth, a stole or 
a tied-at-the-waist cover-up for a swimsuit. A pareu also makes a dandy duffel 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
A group of children from Raiatea were coming on board to sing and dance for us 
that evening. They arrived at the gangway with their crowns and costumes 
wrapped in pareus, which were tied at either end like bulging bananas, and 
slung over bare shoulders. Small drums also were carried in the sturdy cotton 
slings. 
</P>
<P>
Before the show we strolled the streets, buying diet sodas and a French 
newspaper at the Magasin Yee Foo. We exchanged dollars at the air-conditioned 
Banque de Polynesie, where the lone teller told us that the rate had improved 
since we left Tahiti and that the spiky pink blossoms we had admired in the 
Papeete marketplace are called opuhi. 
</P>
<P>
 The teller, who had a bouquet of opuhi near her calculator, printed the name 
on a deposit slip. 
</P>
<P>
The whole town smelled of cotton candy. We sniffed at the sweet evening breeze 
and realized that it was the heady scent of vanilla beans, which grow here in 
profusion. 
</P>
<P>
At sea, amid the simple pleasures of these islands, the Wind Song performs as a 
computer-controlled marvel; courses can be altered, sails furled and unfurled 
from a sleek bridge of flashing screens and panels. 
</P>
<P>
But there are officers on that bridge to do what a computer cannot: answer 
passengers' questions. 
</P>
<P>
"How much draft do we need?" a Floridian asked as we pulled up anchor in the 
clear waters of Moorea's Cook's Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"About 13 feet," replied Dag Dvergastein, the Norwegian captain who seems 
taller than a palm tree. 
</P>
<P>
"But it says 42 feet on the side of the ship," protested the Floridian. 
</P>
<P>
The captain smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"That's 4.2 meters," he said. "Only you Americans measure everything in feet." 
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon we left the lagoon of Bora Bora the breeze picked up and the 
captain set a southerly course. We were humming along at nine knots, savoring 
the odd, homey creak of a yacht. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," a woman called as she leaned from the railing. "I wish we could go 
on like this forever." 
</P>
<P>
"But we cannot," said the captain. "Pretty soon we must bring in the sails and 
turn on the engines to go to the east. If we kept on this course we would go to 
Cape Horn." 
</P>
<P>
Having been through the tumultuous waters off Cape Horn, I was content to have 
him turn on the power and continue our glide through the gentle seas of 
Polynesia.

PLANNERS OK BUILDING BAN FOR MID-CITY; 
</P>
<P>
PLEAS FROM HOLDEN, RESIDENTS SUCCEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Planning Commission has approved a temporary moratorium on 
issuing building and demolition permits in two Mid-City neighborhoods, despite 
the commissioners' concern that an emergency had not been shown to justify it 
legally. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should grant any more rights to these people who want to come 
in and raid our neighborhoods," Councilman Nate Holden told the commissioners 
Thursday in his successful effort to get them to pass the temporary ban. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium, which covers the Pico-Fairfax area and part of the 
Wilshire-Crenshaw area, will take effect as soon as the City Council ratifies 
it, most likely at its meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stopgap Measure 
</P>
<P>
Holden was impatient with commission members who said they sympathized but 
questioned the legal validity of the request. "We have to find a way to do what 
is right, for a change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holden introduced the moratorium to the City Council on Tuesday as a stopgap 
measure until an interim control ordinance can be passed to manage development 
for his district. 
</P>
<P>
Because a part of the Pico-Fairfax neighborhood of single-family Spanish-style 
homes is already zoned for apartments, developers have being buying up the 
houses and replacing them. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the middle-class, racially integrated area have formed the 
Pico-Fairfax Good Neighbors Assn. and are trying to change the zoning to 
prohibit the apartments. About 100 of them attended Tuesday's City Council 
session, and several of their leaders were at City Hall again for the 
commission meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The residents' protest was persuasive to Commissioner Fernando Torres-Gil, who 
voted for the moratorium. "It's unusual to have a racially mixed group come in 
to preserve their area," Torres-Gil said. Commissioner Suzette Neiman cast a 
second "yes" vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tie Vote Broken 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the two other commissioners in attendance voted against the 
ordinance, but commission President William Luddy agreed to a request by Holden 
to change his vote to break the tie. The fifth commissioner was absent. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the commission had rejected the measure, it could be enacted by the 
City Council if 12 members vote for it Tuesday, according to Deputy City Atty. 
Claudia Culling. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen council members voted earlier this week to order the city Building and 
Safety Department to stop issuing building and demolition permits in the two 
neighborhoods for one week until the Planning Commission could address the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
It took considerable persistence on Holden's part to get the commission to 
approve the moratorium Thursday. When the commissioners noted that critical 
documents to justify the emergency measure were missing, Holden demanded that 
city Planning Department workers draft the documents on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permits Still Issued 
</P>
<P>
Holden said he was misled into believing that once the interim control 
ordinance was proposed in June, apartment building permits would be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he said, four such permits were issued in July and August. One 
house was demolished in late August, and five other demolition permits have 
been issued, all of them on Hi Point Street. 
</P>
<P>
If developers have their projects substantially under way when an interim 
control ordinance is passed, they can finish construction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a race against time," Holden said.

TENTATIVE PACT REACHED IN BANK OF AMERICA SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency have tentatively 
settled a lawsuit seeking to force the Bank of America to move from a 
28-year-old branch office on a prime corner near the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The agency filed the lawsuit last year after the bank refused to take a 
$556,000 cash settlement and an offer to relocate the branch to another section 
of the plaza grounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Win-Win Situation' 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America officials said they opposed the move because it forced them to 
trade their high-visibility location for one of several locations offered off 
the beaten path. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will allow the bank to stay at the corner of 39th Street and 
Crenshaw Boulevard. However, the branch will have to undergo a major remodeling 
to make way for a street-widening project that the agency was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a win-win situation," said Bill Price, the CRA's assistant project 
manager for the plaza. "They wanted to stay there. We had offered them a number 
of different locations elsewhere, but they wanted to stay on the corner. Our 
position is that we needed to widen 39th Street." 
</P>
<P>
Agency officials say the agreement also saves years of litigation that would 
have also delayed the construction of a drug store and supermarket near the 
800,000-square-foot indoor mall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pay for Alterations 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the supermarket and drug store has been a major concern in the 
Crenshaw community, where residents complain of being inadequately served by 
major food and drug retailing chains. 
</P>
<P>
The Alexander Haagen Co., which developed the plaza with the CRA, had hoped to 
locate the stores on the present site of the Bank of America branch. Those 
plans will have to be changed now that the bank will remain. 
</P>
<P>
The bank will give up the northern 15 feet of its parcel, including a portion 
of its 9,500-square-foot branch for the street widening between Marlton Avenue 
and Crenshaw Boulevard. In return, the agency will pay Bank of America for the 
alterations needed to its branch, up to $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
The bank, which has 17 years remaining on its lease, will also be given a 
"reasonable opportunity" to review the plans of a proposed community drug store 
and supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's board is expected to act on the tentative agreement when it takes 
up the matter in about two weeks. The agency's staff is recommending approval 
of the pact.

COUNTY PLAN FOR MALIBU SEWER FACES TOUGHEST TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite its status as a world-renowned celebrity haven, Malibu has been mired 
in a most unglamorous debate for the past two years over how to get rid of its 
sludge. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue may be partially resolved this week when a $43-million sewer 
system for Malibu, approved by Los Angeles County supervisors against the 
wishes of thousands of residents, faces its toughest test. 
</P>
<P>
Staff planners for the California Coastal Commission, which must approve the 
system, have recommended that the state panel reject the sewer assessment 
district proposed by the county. Commission planners contend that the sewer 
system's capacity could trigger development in Malibu beyond the limits set in 
the area's Land Use Plan. The commission will hold a public hearing on the 
sewer proposal in Marina del Rey on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission follows the recommendation, it will be a setback for county 
officials, who have sided with development interests and sought to place a 
regional sewer in Malibu for more than two decades. When supervisors approved 
the system in January over the outcry of hundreds of residents who predicted 
that it would lead to widespread development, the Coastal Commission and the 
Malibu Township Council filed lawsuits. The suits forced the county supervisors 
to agree to give the Coastal Commission final say over the plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Don't Agree' 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're disappointed with the commission's findings and we don't 
agree with it," said Harry Stone, deputy director of the county Public Works 
Department. "But at this point we're still trying to digest the information. I 
don't know what we'll do if the commission accepts the recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
Stone said that county officials are scheduled to meet with the commission's 
planning staff before Wednesday's hearing "to go over their figures." The 
planning staff has suggested that the county resubmit a revised plan for the 
sewer assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Land Use Plan adopted by the commission and the county in 1986, a 
limit of 2,110 residential units can be built in the coastal area stretching 
from Topanga Canyon to the Ventura County line and about five miles inland. In 
the three years since the plan was adopted, more than 1,000 new residential 
units have been built. 
</P>
<P>
The plan allows the cap to be raised to 6,582 residential units if another lane 
is added to Pacific Coast Highway, but Caltrans has no plans to expand the 
two-lane road, and no studies are under way to see if it is even feasible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Based on Acreage 
</P>
<P>
Commission planners say that since the sewer assessment district set up by the 
county is based on total acreage rather than the number of parcels that could 
be developed in Malibu, the county's sewer plan might exceed the development 
limits outlined in the Land Use Plan. The staff report also said the county 
sewer plan would allow commercial development in Malibu's Civic Center "far in 
excess" of that allowed in the Land Use Plan. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the staff report said the county failed to determine how many 
residential units could be built in geologically unstable areas such as 
landslide-plagued Big Rock Mesa, which includes hundreds of parcels. 
</P>
<P>
Because the county left out such critical information in its sewer proposal, 
"commission staff was unable to determine the ultimate level of (development) 
allowed by the Land Use Plan within the assessment district," and suggested 
that the missing figures be included in a revised plan. 
</P>
<P>
The sewer hearing is particularly significant to the future of Malibu because 
its outcome could affect the cityhood drive that residents launched in 1987 in 
response to the county's insistence that the community needs a regional sewer 
system. The supervisors have scheduled an Oct. 19 hearing to set an election 
date in Malibu, but if county officials are sent scrambling back to the drawing 
board to revise the sewer plan, it could delay the election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Retain Control 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of trying, county officials this summer were able to 
convince the Local Agency Formation Commission -- the panel that decides 
incorporation matters -- that the county should retain control over sewers in 
Malibu for up 10 years after it incorporates. 
</P>
<P>
Still, community leaders, who have fought the the sewer plan and who want to 
incorporate to wrest control of Malibu from the county, said they are pleased 
with the commission staff's findings. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that anything that would induce buildup would severely 
compromise the Land Use Plan and harm the natural resources that Malibu 
represents," said Larry Wan, president of the Malibu Township Council. "And we 
believe that the county's (sewer) would be greatly growth-inducing." 
</P>
<P>
The county's sewer plan calls for construction of a sewer treatment plant and a 
pumping system to carry waste water up to seven miles along Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Health Hazard Cited 
</P>
<P>
County officials have insisted that a sewer is required, based on staff studies 
that they say documents a "significant public health hazard" because of 
discharges from malfunctioning septic tanks, particularly in the million-dollar 
beachfront properties. The findings by the Department of Health Services 
allowed the county to impose a sewer system -- with typical hookup fees of 
$10,000 per home -- without a vote of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Sewer opponents, several hundred of whom are expected to show up for the 
Coastal Commission hearing, say the biggest flaw of the county system is that 
it forces homeowners to pay for a system that mostly benefits commercial 
interests. They contend that about 70% of the $43-million system will be paid 
for by property owners outside the Civic Center area, a vast majority of whom 
are single-family homeowners.

SANTA MONICA'S THIRD STREET MALL SET TO PROMENADE; 
</P>
<P>
REOPENS SATURDAY WITH HIGH HOPES AFTER AN ELABORATE FACE LIFT BY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica's Third Street Mall, an aging and tattered outdoor retail center, 
is ready to promenade into the 1990s as a place where people will still shop, 
but where city officials and merchants hope they will also go for dining and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-year, $10-million renovation project and a name change, the 
three-block-long, 25-year-old mall will reopen next weekend as the Third Street 
Promenade, complete with life-size shrubs trimmed in the shape of dinosaurs, 
fountains and other landscaping embellishments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cafes, Theaters 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the promenade will be celebrated Saturday from noon to 7 p.m. 
with a parade and dance concert. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 25 years, pedestrians will share 3rd Street with cars. 
The new promenade will accommodate one lane of vehicle traffic in each 
direction, although the city will probably restrict such traffic to the late 
afternoon and evening. 
</P>
<P>
The Third Street Promenade will still have many of the same retail shops, 
including the J.C. Penney department store, but it will eventually have new 
outdoor cafes, movie theaters, classy restaurants, nightclubs with dancing and 
live entertainment, office buildings and some residential units. 
</P>
<P>
"The character will be one of a place where people will walk around from place 
to place," said Thomas H. Carroll, executive director of the Bayside District 
Corp., the nonprofit group that will manage the promenade. "It's exactly what 
we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the design of the public space is lovely," said Mayor Dennis Zane, a 
major force in the mall's renovation. "It was on a slow death march, and we 
have saved it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Businesses Killed 
</P>
<P>
The mall's decline was substantially aided by a succession of planning 
decisions by the city. Built in the mid-1960s, when outdoor pedestrian malls 
were the rage, Third Street met with modest initial success despite a serious 
shortage of convenient parking. 
</P>
<P>
The city tried to solve that problem by building parking garages along 2nd and 
4th streets -- killing most business along those streets in the process and 
putting the entire neighborhood into a tailspin. The final blow to the mall was 
when Santa Monica Place, an enclosed shopping center with two department stores 
as anchors, opened across from the mall in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to renovate the run-down shops and offices along 3rd Street between 
Broadway and Wilshire Boulevard began in 1983. A final plan was adopted in 
1987, and construction began in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
City officials actually began their effort to create a new shopping and 
entertainment district a few years ago by persuading two comedy clubs, Second 
City and The Improv, to open on Santa Monica Boulevard between 2nd and 4th 
streets. City officials also encouraged new restaurants, such as the Broadway 
Bar and Grill, to open. 
</P>
<P>
New construction focused on public improvements along the street, since the 
buildings are all privately owned. The city issued $13 million in bonds, with 
$3 million to pay existing debt, $4 million for new parking spaces and $6 
million for the street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Parking 
</P>
<P>
Property owners will repay the bonds over 30 years through an assessment 
district. 
</P>
<P>
For their money, property owners are getting 300 new parking spaces to bring 
the total in six garages along 2nd and 4th streets to 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
In planning the revival, city officials and private developers included the 
entire neighborhood, not just 3rd Street. To restore some life to 2nd and 4th 
streets, retail space has been constructed on the street level of the garages, 
and the city will subsidize some rents there to bring in desirable tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Along 3rd Street, the city has planted palm and jacaranda trees, improved 
lighting, placed wrought-iron benches and trash receptacles and built plazas at 
each end of the three blocks, containing fountains and the topiary dinosaurs. 
Sidewalks have been widened to 30 feet and the street narrowed to 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will decide Tuesday what hours traffic will be allowed on the 
promenade, although it is likely to be limited to after 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Though the improvements along the street have been all cosmetic, they have 
created excitement among developers and merchants who are moving into the 
promenade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going to Be Wonderful' 
</P>
<P>
"In 1984 it was a very tough sell, but now everybody wants to be there," said 
Barbara Tenzer, a commercial real estate broker for Sommer Broida Commercial 
Brokerage Co. who has been involved in the project for six years. "I think it's 
going to be wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
The Janss Corp. is building three commercial projects along the promenade: 
</P>
<P>
* A seven-story, 58,000-square-foot building at 3rd and Broadway with office 
space, a four-screen Cineplex Odeon theater, 32 apartments and a restaurant 
operated by Bruce Marder, whose other restaurants include DC3 and Rebecca's. 
</P>
<P>
* A four-story, 56,000-square-foot office and retail building at Santa Monica 
Boulevard and 3rd Street, scheduled to open in the summer of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
* A six-story, 80,000-square-foot office building on 2nd Street in conjunction 
with Century West Development Co., also scheduled for completion in summer, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Janss, president of Janss Corp., said he probably would not have built 
along the promenade if the city had not made the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that improvements were being made was instrumental in our decision to 
build there," Janss said. "But it's not just the improvements themselves, but 
the excitement when you get a district that has a lot of development." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Viewed as Extension 
</P>
<P>
Although the 8-year-old Santa Monica Place shopping center is on the south end 
of the promenade, it is being viewed as a complement rather than a competitor 
to the promenade. 
</P>
<P>
"I see (the promenade) as a tremendous boost for the 160 businesses in the 
center," said Tom Gilmore, group marketing manager for Rouse Co., the Columbia, 
Md.-based owner of the shopping center. "It will increase the critical mass 
necessary to get people to Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore said Santa Monica Place will make some improvements of its own early 
next year, particularly in its food court and entrances. 
</P>
<P>
But with the new shops and restaurants coming into the promenade, many older 
businesses have left. Some have moved to the rent-subsidized street-level 
spaces along 2nd and 4th streets, but other merchants have gone out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Bayside District Corp. director Carroll said there is about a 30% vacancy rate 
in the 500,000 square feet of retail space along the promenade and 2nd and 4th 
streets. He said he hopes to have a mix of shops on the promenade, but 
acknowledged that when leases are up in a few years, many older shops may be 
priced out or find that the promenade's new clientele is not interested in 
their merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's regrettable," said Mayor Zane of the expected exodus, "but I'm not sure 
it's avoidable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THIRD STREET PROMENADE 
</P>
<P>
Location: a three-block stretch of 3rd Street, from Broadway to Wilshire 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Size: 500,000 square feet of retail space in six square blocks, including shops 
along 2nd and 4th streets. 
</P>
<P>
Parking: 3,000 spaces in six garages along 2nd and 4th streets. 
</P>
<P>
Cost: $10 million.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE FOR ZONING CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was surprised to read your coverage of the hearing concerning the zone change 
on the block east of La Cienega Boulevard, between Beverly Boulevard and 3rd 
Street, otherwise known as the Beverly Connection (Times, Sept. 3). 
</P>
<P>
My proposed ordinance strictly limits development on this property to what 
exists there today, and only what exists there today -- 291,000 square feet. 
Your coverage suggests that the zone change, if approved, would bestow more 
development rights to the property owner than he currently has. This is simply 
not the case. 
</P>
<P>
Your article also suggested that there was broad opposition to my proposal. In 
fact, proponents of the new ordinance outnumbered the opponents at the public 
hearing, a fact The Times failed to mention. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for this is simple: The city, at my behest, placed extraordinary 
conditions limiting development on that property. The Dart Square (Beverly 
Connection) property has been a two-story commercial building since the late 
1940s. Some years ago, when Dart Industries sold the property, the new owners 
sought to build 1.1 million square feet of high-rise commercial, retail and 
hotel space on that eight-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
After years of toughing it out with the new owners, I succeeded in winning city 
approval for conditions which: (a) keep the building low-rise (two stories); 
(b) provide adequate parking (1,500 parking spaces), and (c) keep the building 
in scale with what has been there for the last 40 years. In addition, streets 
have been widened and new traffic signals installed to facilitate the traffic 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic and overdevelopment is a problem that is affecting the entire city, not 
just our neighborhood. That's why I and Councilman Marvin Braude authored 
Proposition U, which cut commercial development by half in this and most other 
parts of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the Beverly Connection is approximately half the size it could 
be under Proposition U and one-quarter the size it could have been just 2 1/2 
years ago before Proposition U was approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
That's why, with very few exceptions, area residents have embraced my proposal. 
They, like I, want these hard-won concessions written into law, and that's the 
only thing the zone change will do.

WHERE CANCER PATIENTS' HOPES FOR WELLNESS THRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I couldn't get inside fast enough to be nourished by other cancer patients, 
and to know I was not alone.... I could never buy what I got there, not ever." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gilda Radner 
</P>
<P>
What the late comedian got at the Wellness Community in Santa Monica may soon 
be available to cancer patients and their families in Ventura County, say 
organizers of a move to establish the nationally recognized program here. 
</P>
<P>
Radner, whose tag line, "It's always something," provided an ironic title for 
her book about her struggle with cancer, wrote of a deep-rooted support 
provided by other patients and staff members at the Wellness Community, a 
nonprofit organization offering an array of free seminars, counseling sessions 
and social activities. 
</P>
<P>
Radner, who died in May, earmarked part of the proceeds of her book for the 
7-year-old group. 
</P>
<P>
But even before her death focused public attention on the Wellness Community, a 
group of doctors, nurses, cancer patients and others in the Conejo Valley were 
planning to set up a branch in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Similar campaigns are under way at five other locations in California, as well 
as in Knoxville, Tenn., and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County group, which consists of about 130 residents, has raised 
more than $50,000 of the $200,000 anticipated for first-year operating costs, 
said Marty Nason, a registered nurse and mental health counselor who is helping 
spearhead the drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staging Fund-Raisers 
</P>
<P>
Organizers are staging fund-raisers, including a classical music recital today 
at North Ranch Country Club, scouring the state for grants and putting together 
a campaign to woo corporate donations. 
</P>
<P>
The activity is all aimed at replicating the Santa Monica program. The Wellness 
Community offers workshops about such suddenly important matters as health 
insurance and nutrition. It teaches patients techniques for relaxation. And it 
provides groups where patients draw each other out of a twilight of anguish and 
even learn to crack jokes about their disease. 
</P>
<P>
But the program is not intended to replace medical treatments. "It's always 
stressed that if you had to choose one or the other, it would be most important 
to choose traditional medicine," said Nason, who has counseled cancer patients 
for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Even as established an organization as the American Cancer Society refers 
patients to the Wellness Community. Barbara Broide, director of the society's 
L.A. Coastal Cities Unit, said her volunteers frequently drive them to the 
Santa Monica headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen Ventura County residents commute to the Wellness Community in 
Santa Monica each week, but Nason said the hour's drive is too much for many 
patients. The only other operating Wellness Community is even farther away, in 
Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, more than 8,000 people have received help since the program's 
start, and 500 patients and family members attend self-help groups and seminars 
every week, group leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
Participants fight for their recovery in an atmosphere of hope, support and 
learning, said Harold Benjamin, the organization's founder and unpaid national 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who come here come here because they are fighters. They're not 
giving up on themselves," said Benjamin, an attorney and social psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the modest yellow house that serves as the Wellness Community's 
headquarters, sofas and chairs line the muted peach walls, which are decorated 
with photographs of smiling and laughing participants. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent group discussion meeting, about 25 newcomers heard facilitators Flo 
Porter and Betty Boltuch, both cancer survivors, describe how the Wellness 
Community operates. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, the conversation grew animated, alternately punctuated with 
laughter and tears. 
</P>
<P>
Eddye, a colon cancer patient, told the group how she pictures her chemotherapy 
as miniature Pac Men gobbling cancer cells. Tina, a tall, tanned breast cancer 
patient, drew roars of laughter by telling how her 3-year-old nephew believes 
that her cancer is a severe case of flea infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney, 85, a tall man with a booming voice, talks of his struggle with despair 
over his terminal prognosis. His downy white hair is just starting to grow back 
after falling out from chemotherapy. He strokes his sprouting pate 
affectionately. 
</P>
<P>
As the meeting unfolded, there was laughter, pain, sorrow and joy. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt terribly isolated, terribly alone -- nobody understood what I was going 
through," said Henia, a former breast cancer patient. "But here I found people 
who didn't really know me, yet cared so much for me." 
</P>
<P>
Other Wellness Community veterans echo those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
Liver cancer patient Beverly Ginsberg, 40, of Woodland Hills said she might not 
be alive today were it not for the support of fellow cancer patients who talked 
her into undergoing lifesaving chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hair Loss 
</P>
<P>
"When we first went to the Wellness Community, I said I wasn't going to take 
the chemo and they got crazy on me. They said, 'Well, do you want to live or do 
you want to die?' And I said, 'I don't want to lose my hair.' And they said, 
'Oh, get off of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ginsberg did lose her hair, but it has grown back. To see her now, one might 
never guess that she continues to battle cancer. As with many cancer patients, 
she doesn't have the gaunt look often associated with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors told Ginsberg in 1987 that she only had four months to live. Although 
she has survived, the cancer has spread throughout her body and she has more 
recently been told that she must take weekly chemotherapy as long as she lives. 
</P>
<P>
Facing such a proposition, especially when many other cancer patients are 
counting down to the end of their treatments, makes for a lot of anger, 
Ginsberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the Wellness Community, I'm able to vent it and get it out there and be 
angry," she said. "If you can't take some anger, and some prodding, and some 
laughing about cancer, it's not a place for you. It's not a place for people 
who feel sorry for themselves. They may start out that way, but they sure don't 
finish that way."

JEWELRY CHAIN PLANS MOVE TO MONROVIA

MONROVIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to boost the image of the downtown commercial strip, city 
officials will provide a $200,000 low-interest loan to a major jewelry chain 
that is moving its corporate offices to Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, serving in its role as the Monrovia Redevelopment Agency, has 
authorized the loan to Barry's Jewelers to move its offices to the northwest 
corner of Lemon and Myrtle avenues. The firm's current offices are in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's will invest about $3.8 million to rehabilitate a portion of an existing 
building and build a 50,000-square-foot structure with office and parking 
space. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operates Hatfield, Ringmaker 
</P>
<P>
The firm, which has 226 stores in 19 states -- including Hatfield Jewelers and 
The Ringmaker in this area -- acquired the properties in the last year. The 
loan was an inducement for the company to expand the scope of its original plan 
for the property. 
</P>
<P>
The loan is one of the largest offered by the agency for a downtown project 
since the Foothill Park Plaza Shopping Center was built in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In an Aug. 30 report, Don Hopper, director of community development, said 
Barry's 200 employees will increase the daytime population and customer base of 
the business area, a longtime goal of the Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3% Interest Rate 
</P>
<P>
"The quality and magnitude of the project and its impact on the central 
business district support such a large commitment," Hopper said. 
</P>
<P>
The loan, which will go toward remodeling the 1924 building on Myrtle Avenue, 
carries an interest rate of 3% and must be repaid within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's will lease the 13,000 square feet in that building to retail tenants 
once the renovations are finished in November. That phase, which will cost 
about $250,000, will include installation of new store fronts, canvas awnings 
and electrical upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the new office complex is scheduled to be completed by the end 
of April. The building will have an exterior of vintage brick and feature 
canopies and black brick columns. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's decided to move its administrative offices because it needed more 
space, said Jay Johnson, a company vice president.

7% UTILITY TAX UP TO VOTERS TUESDAY IN CASH-STRAPPED HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's voters on Tuesday will decide the fate of a 7% utility tax that 
would raise an estimated $2.74 million a year in additional revenue for this 
financially strapped city. 
</P>
<P>
The city's five councilmen are strong proponents of the measure. They say the 
tax is essential if the city is to hire more police officers to keep pace with 
a growing population and gain stable financial footing. 
</P>
<P>
"The future of the city will be determined on the 12th of September," said 
Councilman Jim Roberts, who heads a political action committee in support of 
the measure. "If we don't get this passed, we're going to go back to some major 
cuts." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents contend that the council has made some poor financial decisions, 
which include tying up million of dollars in the city's redevelopment program. 
That money could have been used for police salaries, among other things, 
opponents argue. They also say residents of Huntington Park, which was recently 
rated one of the poorest communities in the nation, should not have to pay for 
those decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a police issue. . . . It's a money issue," said Louis Hernandez, 
chairman of a group called Huntington Park Citizens for Responsible Government. 
"The City Council stresses (the need for more police) to cover up their 
mistakes in redevelopment." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' Committee for Utility Users Tax is sending out several flyers and 
campaigning door-to-door in support of the measure, the councilman said. The 
Huntington Park Police Officers Assn. has been campaigning for the utility tax. 
Signs urging "Yes" votes on the measure are in the windows of some businesses 
near City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Utility Users Tax raised $4,548 and spent $2,385 as of Aug. 
27, according to campaign disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts donated $100 to the effort. Curtis Fresch, listed as president of Poker 
Club Management, which controls the Huntington Park Casino, donated $500, as 
did his brother, Eric Fresch, agent for H. P. Disposal, a garbage company that 
holds the city's commercial trash collection franchise. 
</P>
<P>
The joint reelection committee for councilmen Thomas E. Jackson and Jack Parks 
donated $479.99, and the reelection committee for City Clerk Marilyn Boyette 
and City Treasurer Eileen F. Gerardi provided $995.12, according to the 
statements. The Huntington Park Police Officers Assn. donated $1,472. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez's group, Huntington Park Citizens for Responsible Government, is 
working to defeat the measure by telephoning voters, going door-to-door and 
sending out a mailer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The group raised $800 as of last week to oppose the ballot measure, Hernandez 
said. The contributions include $100 from Hernandez and $200 from Morrison 
Escrow Co., which is owned by the wife of former Huntington Park Police Chief 
Geano Contessotto, Hernandez said. The committee is not required to file a 
campaign disclosure statement unless it raises or spends $1,000, Boyette said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials thought their financial problems were solved and that they would 
be able to hire more police last May 15, when the council approved a 7% tax on 
electricity, gas, water and telephone usage. The tax was to have taken effect 
when the fiscal year started on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
But a recent state Supreme Court decision undercut the council's authority to 
impose the tax without voter approval. The council decided against collecting 
the tax and scheduled Tuesday's special election. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by voters, the tax will raise about $2.74 million for the city's 
anemic general fund, which pays for most city services, including police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they want to use about $1 million of the tax money to hire 
22 new Police Department employees, including two sergeants and 13 officers. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the money would probably go toward employee raises and to restore 
some positions that have been cut to reduce city spending over the past two 
years, Chief Administrative Officer Donald L. Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this summer, the council approved an austerity budget that had more 
than $150,000 in cuts from last year's spending plan. Those cuts included the 
elimination of three maintenance and painting positions that were vacant or 
filled with temporary employees, Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
No raises were budgeted for city employees. The city's three employee 
associations have agreed that their members will continue working at current 
pay levels, pending the outcome of the election. Huntington Park employees 
received a 4.2% raise last year, which costs the city about $300,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
The budget projects spending of about $10.2 million from the general fund, 
leaving a scant reserve of $11,400 for the year. The city finished the last 
year with a $475,000 general fund reserve. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say Huntington Park's financial problems are the result of 
various factors. Federal and state subsidies have been reduced or eliminated, 
depriving the city of more than $1 million annually for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
The city also has lost three truck and car dealerships in the past year that 
generated about $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has picked up new businesses and sales tax money, which has kept 
general fund revenues relatively stable, but labor and other costs have 
increased, Jeffers noted. 
</P>
<P>
Those financial difficulties have been complicated by the city's Redevelopment 
Agency, which has borrowed about $14 million from the city in the past several 
years to pay its debts. 
</P>
<P>
The city loaned the Redevelopment Agency about $1.5 million in sales tax 
revenue during 1987-88 and about $750,000 last year, Jeffers said. He estimates 
that the city will have to loan the agency as much as $500,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
Tax opponent Hernandez said city residents and businesses should not have to 
pay for the "mismanaged, debt-ridden and overly aggressive redevelopment 
agency." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Roberts admitted that the council should not have let the 
Redevelopment Agency get into debt it could not repay without draining city 
resources. The council doubles as the board of directors for the Redevelopment 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts argued that most of the $14 million should have been held in 
reserve, anyway, for unforeseen costs, such as rebuilding after an earthquake. 
He said the utility tax revenue is still needed to pay for additional police 
and other services. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts also said city residents and businesses could afford the tax. He 
estimates the tax for the average residential customer will be about $10 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill is not an unreasonable price to pay for a community when you're going 
to have improved law enforcement, improved protection," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's call for more officers is supported by a recent study by the 
Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. 
The study indicated the city's ratio of officers to residents is lower than the 
state average. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department is authorized to have 59 sworn officers. With a 
population of about 52,000, Huntington Park has 1.13 officers per 1,000 
residents. The average city police department in the state has a 1.51 officers 
per 1,000 residents, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez and other tax opponents said they agree there is a need for more 
police, but they said many residents, especially senior citizens on fixed 
incomes, would unfairly feel the bite. 
</P>
<P>
"I have $90 to live for the month," said senior citizen Ann Tribolet, who is 
opposed to the levy. "With the tax I'd have $80." 
</P>
<P>
A recently released study by Chicago-based urbanologist Pierre deVise listed 
Huntington Park as the seventh poorest community in the country with a 
per-capita income of $6,298. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also have contended that there is no guarantee the money will be used 
for police enforcement. In an attempt to neutralize that argument, the City 
Council voted last week to authorize the hiring of 15 policemen, if the tax 
measure passes. Police Chief Patrick M. Connolly said it would take a minimum 
of six months to fill the positions. 
</P>
<P>
If the measure is unsuccessful, city officials will review the budget to 
identify cuts to free money for employee raises, Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park Police Officers Assn. President William Diers said failure of 
the measure would be a "major disappointment" to the department's overworked 
officers. But he said there is no threat of a police strike.

MOSQUITO 'SWAT' TEAM LESSENS SUMMER'S STING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
They thrive beneath dead bouquets in cemetery flower vases. They lurk in 
discarded tin cans and abandoned tires. 
</P>
<P>
Summer is their season and, left to their own small devices, they multiply in 
staggering numbers. A single unkempt swimming pool can become an Olympic-sized 
nursery for a million or more. 
</P>
<P>
The creatures are mosquitoes, unlovable little insects that can make summer a 
misery with their bites and can transmit such genuinely dreadful diseases as 
encephalitis and malaria. 
</P>
<P>
There are remarkably few mosquitoes in much of Los Angeles because of men like 
Mark Brooks, one of the exterminating angels of the Los Angeles County West 
Mosquito Abatement District, headquartered in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mosquito Zappers 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, 33, who lives in Mar Vista, is one of the district's dozen full-time 
employees, a deadly cadre of mosquito zappers who seek and destroy the insects 
from the gurgling creeks of Malibu to the horse troughs of Rolling Hills 
Estates, from the sumptuous back yards of Beverly Hills to the littered 
concrete floor of Ballona Creek. 
</P>
<P>
In summer, the full timers are joined by nine seasonal employees. They chase 
their prey with specialized equipment that includes trucks with the steering 
wheel and a door-mounted tank of pesticide on the right, so the driver can 
spray a curb-side infestation and drive at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Like his counterparts in the three other mosquito abatement districts in Los 
Angeles County, Brooks is used to people laughing when they hear what he does. 
But Brooks knows his job is important. "Without the mosquito abatement 
district, there would be encephalitis, there would be malaria, and it would be 
no joke." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Worldwide, mosquitoes are the insects most dangerous to human health. 
They are carriers -- or vectors, as public health officials call them -- of a 
host of diseases, including yellow fever and dengue fever. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tar Pits Still Tricky 
</P>
<P>
Of the 600 square miles that Brooks and his colleagues patrol, perhaps the 
hottest single spot is the La Brea tar pits in Hancock Park. The tar pits, 
which once doomed mastodons and saber-toothed cats, are now odoriferous pools 
of asphalt and water that attract Culex tarsalis, a mosquito that can transmit 
encephalitis, a sometimes deadly inflammation of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
"Millions would hatch out every night if we didn't spray," Brooks said. Every 
Monday, when the museums are closed and few visitors are in the park, a 
mosquito abatement crew blankets the tar pits with a petroleum product called 
Golden Bear that floats on the surface of the water and suffocates any mosquito 
larvae present. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a guaranteed kill," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
Hancock Park is also the home of the district's flock of "sentinel" chickens. 
As Brooks explained, the district keeps two dozen laying hens in a coop in the 
park to serve as an early warning system for encephalitis. 
</P>
<P>
Blood is drawn from the chickens each month and sent to a laboratory at UC 
Berkeley, where it is examined for evidence of the virus that causes 
encephalitis. Although an occasional chicken tests positive, there have been no 
reported cases of human mosquito-borne encephalitis locally since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diversified Methods 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, DDT and other dangerous chemicals were used to kill adult 
mosquitoes. Today the abatement crews work at destroying the larvae with 
relatively benign agents, including mosquito fish. Brooks said the Westside 
district distributes about 25,000 of the gray, guppy-like fish each year. Many 
are given free to homeowners to put in their fishponds. The fish also work in 
horse troughs, Brooks noted. "When the horse goes to drink, the fish will just 
dive." 
</P>
<P>
The computers that are now a feature of mosquito abatement in Los Angeles keep 
track of thousands of spots where mosquitoes are known to multiply, including 
the holes left in the ground when oil derricks are dismantled. New construction 
often creates breeding grounds, and a major fire can turn a neighborhood's 
swimming pools into entomological time bombs. After the Baldwin Hills fire, 
dozens of back-yard pools were added to the district's route books for regular 
inspection and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
To help pinpoint problematic pools, a mosquito-abatement technician often flies 
along when County Sheriff's Department helicopters are out on surveillance or 
pursuing suspects. The film is turned over to the county Health Department, 
which scrutinizes it for murky pools and alerts the relevant abatement 
districts.

<P>
City Clerk/Treasurer Jenny Young-Felty has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Young-Felty, 47, last week sent a brief letter of resignation to city 
officials, and removed her belongings from City Hall Wednesday afternoon. She 
did not give a reason for the resignation, Acting City Manager Lee Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Young-Felty, who had held the position since February, 1987, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Downey Mayor Randall R. Barb also declined to comment other than to say: "We 
have a resignation from Jenny. That's really the whole story." 
</P>
<P>
Young-Felty, a former Whittier city clerk, was appointed to the Downey position 
by the City Council after the retirement of City Clerk/Treasurer Robert L. 
Shand. The position paid $4,129 a month, a city spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Barb said the City Council is scheduled to appoint Shand as interim city 
clerk/treasurer at its meeting Tuesday night.

COMPTON'S NEW, HIGHER WATER RATES TO APPEAR IN BILLS RECEIVED IN OCTOBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The price of water in Compton goes up this month. 
</P>
<P>
Water rates were raised with City Council approval to 81 cents for every 100 
cubic feet, up from 62 cents. The meter charge of $6.20 a month remains the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
Regina Turney-Murph, general manager of the Compton Municipal Water Department, 
said that the increase means that a residential customer who uses 1,000 cubic 
feet of water a month will see the bill rise to $14.26 a month, up from $12.26. 
</P>
<P>
The fee charged for turning off a water meter will climb to $35, from $15.50, 
and removal of the meter now costs $50, instead of $35, under the rate 
increases that took effect Sept. 1. The department serves about 75,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of living, everything has gone up since 1984," when the department 
had its last rate increase, Turney-Murph said. The rate increases were included 
as recommendations in a management study and will allow the department to 
finance major repairs of the water system. 
</P>
<P>
She said the rate increases will show up on the bills received by customers in 
October.

BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE GETTYIT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR THE LARGELY INVISIBLE 
STAFF OF 235 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even more than most museums, the J. Paul Getty Museum remains a mystery to the 
public. Beyond the immaculate facade of its pastel Roman villa and plush 
galleries, little is known of the museum's inner workings or the people who 
keep it running. 
</P>
<P>
 An occasional controversy or big-ticket purchase puts the museum under a hot 
media spotlight and slaps its name on the front pages of major newspapers. On 
such occasions, museum director John Walsh appears, in print, explaining museum 
policies or commenting on art historical and ethical issues. Marion True, 
curator of antiquities, is often quoted on spectacular new acquisitions and 
issues of cultural patrimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservator Jerry Podany sometimes explains his highly technical procedures as 
he studies and authenticates ancient artworks. George Goldner, curator of 
drawings and acting curator of paintings, is cited as architect of the museum's 
collection of drawings and more recently for spearheading the purchases of 
expensive paintings at auction. Paintings conservator Andrea Rothe has been an 
eloquent defender of a non-Getty project -- the restoration of the Sistine 
Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 But this handful of high-profile people are only part of what goes on at the 
Getty. Behind the scenes about 235 other members of the staff conduct business 
as usual. And, according to Walsh, they are some of the museum's best keep 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's major resource has never been the ability to buy a $35-million 
painting, Walsh says, but "intensely involved, excellent people who are highly 
motivated" by opportunities at the Getty. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at some of those people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The first human contact most people have with the J. Paul Getty Museum is a 
voice answering the telephone when they dial (213) 458-2003. The voice belongs 
to one of 11 reservations agents -- typically bright college students with an 
interest in art -- lodged on the 10th floor of a Santa Monica office building. 
Working four at a time on part-time shifts with supervisor Eloise Kong, the 
agents field up to 1,000 calls a day. Most are requests for parking 
reservations (required because of museum's residential location); others are 
for lectures and concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The agents are trained to impart a lot of information in a little time, usually 
no more than a minute, and to log reservations on a computerized system. They 
also deliver the bad news when the museum is booked up -- and listen to reasons 
that the Getty should make an exception, just this once: "My in-laws just came 
into town." "We have visitors from Siberia who will only be here for one day." 
"My term paper is due tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Some callers affect a snooty voice, in keeping with their idea of the museum's 
image, while others are so happy to get a reservation that they send flowers or 
snapshots of their families. 
</P>
<P>
Repetitive work inevitably leads to boredom, but the reservations staff combats 
frustration with camaraderie, an occasional pig-out on spaghetti, and recorded 
Beatles music on Sunday mornings. During slow times, agents read or do their 
homework. "It's a little like a dormitory," Kong said, noting that a recent 
addition to the office is a couch where telephone-weary agents can relax. 
</P>
<P>
An agent's job isn't a dead-end career; it's a temporary way to make a living 
while pursuing more exalted goals. Claudia Montero, for example, is an art 
history student; Loreen Matsushima is an artist who also teaches at the museum; 
Jill Hamilton is a student of French and international relations who may move 
into art conservation. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'd like to be doing isn't very realistic at this point," said artist and 
assistant supervisor Annabelle Port. 
</P>
<P>
"This is reality," agreed Kong, herself a fine arts major. 
</P>
<P>
Some visitors are so smitten with the Getty's ocean-side environs that they 
linger in the gardens, barely setting foot in the galleries. The most 
botanically aware know that they are seeing something more than a smashing 
array of healthy plants in an extraordinary setting. The Getty gardens adhere 
as strictly as possible to an ancient Roman theme. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is patterned after the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum (destroyed in 
AD 79 by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius), and the gardens were designed by Denis 
Kurtitz with equal attention to authenticity. He created two peristyle gardens 
in central courtyards, smaller gardens on opposite sides of the museum and a 
long, rambling herb garden containing fragrant plants that the Romans used for 
cooking and medicinal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't just run out to the nursery and buy the plants we need. We have to 
comb through catalogues from all over the world, collect seeds and propagate 
plants," gardener Steve Cutting said. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult enough to find a single example of a desired plant, much less an 
entire flat, so propagation specialist Daphne Heath spends most of her time 
turning one precious plant into several dozen or restoring modern versions of 
plants to their original forms. How do Getty gardeners know what grew in 
Herculaneum? By consulting ancient literature, Italian frescoes and other 
artworks of the period, Cutting said. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling out reference books in his office, Cutting pointed out herbs, flowers, 
laurels and garlands in reproductions of ancient artworks. Strolling through 
the gardens, he matched up pictures with real plants. 
</P>
<P>
Developing and maintaining authentic Roman gardens is not the only challenge 
for gardeners at the Getty, Cutting said. Both peristyle gardens are planted 
directly above the parking garage -- in about a foot of soil. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors who think that installing a work of art involves little more than 
plopping it down in an appropriate gallery won't believe what George Johnson 
and Mark Mitton do for a living. On their own time, both men are artists, but 
they work full time designing and fabricating earthquake-proof mounts for the 
Getty's artworks. 
</P>
<P>
Helping the museum's collection to survive The Big One, they put steel rods 
through marble sculpture and build metal armatures and foam cores that fit 
inside hollow bronzes. They fashion wire and plexiglass clamps for ceramics and 
glassware, make beds of compressed fibers to support sculptural furniture, 
faux-marble pedestals for decorative arts and metal mounts that attach tall 
clocks to walls but disconnect so that they can be wound each week. Once a 
mount is built, they connect it to a hidden device inside a pedestal or to a 
wall -- most likely one that is covered with expensive, easily damaged fabric 
and doesn't have conveniently located supports behind it. Every piece of art 
presents a unique problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we've ever repeated a mount," Johnson said, noting that it can 
take thousands of hours to come up with a design that can be reproduced for $5 
or $10. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the idea is to design an apparatus that allows the art to float free 
of its support, according to its own rhythm. In other situations, artworks are 
firmly fixed to heavily weighted supports. A 16th-Century bronze mortar, for 
example, requires a 600-lb. ballast hidden inside a wooden pedestal. One 
constant principle for securing three-dimensional pieces is to lower their 
centers of gravity, often by putting lead bricks inside pedestals. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Mitton have been on the job for about five years, working closely 
with curators and conservators. At first they plied their highly technical 
trade quite intuitively, but now a recent research project done with USC has 
validated their guesses and provided some guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Showing off their work in the galleries to a reporter, Johnson and Mitton soon 
attracted a crowd. Awestruck visitors watched as the pair lifted a massive 
Italian ceramic head of Christ off its pedestal. They uncovered an armature 
attached by cables to a mechanism inside the pedestal that allows the sculpture 
a safe range of movement. Moving on to another gallery, Johnson gave a push to 
a bronze Venus on an inlaid marble table and the figure whirled around like a 
graceful roller skater. Then the two men picked up the sculpture and revealed a 
foam core with embedded casters that is tethered to the wall by a transparent 
plastic cord. 
</P>
<P>
"A successful mount is the one you don't see," Mitton said. 
</P>
<P>
Stunned by what they had seen, the crowd went off in search of other invisible 
successes. 
</P>
<P>
"Ooooo, what shall I show you?" Catherine Hess asked, as if she were a sweet 
freak ordered to choose a few treats from a well-stocked Parisian patisserie. 
In fact she was trotting out her favorites among the Getty's distinguished 
collection of maiolica, the colorful tin-glazed earthenware from the 
Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
Surveying objects in storage, Hess presented a 15th-Century Tuscan jug that she 
fondly called "a wow object" because it's the oldest piece in the collection 
and notably elegant, then offered an intricately painted 16th-Century plate 
done after Marcantonio Raimondi's engraving, "The Abduction of Helen." Upstairs 
in the maiolica gallery, a jewel-like room that opens onto a balcony 
overlooking the museum's west garden, Hess pointed out a 16th-Century dish, 
long thought to depict a betrothal. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked at it, I said, 'No, this isn't marriage. This is divorce court,' 
" she recalled. Research eventually revealed that the painting portrays a scene 
in Virgil's Aeneid in which Queen Amata pleads with her daughter's intended 
husband to stop fighting the Trojans. Hess is an assistant curator of sculpture 
and works of art who came to the museum in 1984 as an intern and joined the 
staff later that year. She innocently expressed an interest in maiolica at the 
moment when Peter Fusco, curator of sculpture, was contemplating the purchase 
of an English collection of maiolica that now forms the core of the museum's 
collection. On a fast track to scholarly maturity, she took over the Getty's 
maiolica and became an expert while writing the museum's handsome catalogue on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Hess had studied Italian Renaissance painting and Italian literature at UCLA 
and spent three years in Italy, not knowing that her experience would coalesce 
in the rather coarse, colored pots that first caught her eye at the Huntington 
art galleries. "Little did I know that I would be riding the crest of the 
maiolica wave," she said, noting that several books on the subject are now in 
the works and that contemporary versions of maiolica are popular items in 
decorator shops. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a different aesthetic," Hess said, looking around the gallery of brightly 
glazed ceramics. "If you are used to Sevres porcelain, this can look pretty 
sloppy, but that's why I like it." 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of our star boxes," said Lee Hendrix, lifting a big black case of 
Rembrandt drawings from storage and presenting a few impressive examples. As 
associate curator of drawings, Hendrix specializes in northern European works 
-- German, Dutch, Flemish -- while chief curator George Goldner focuses on 
Italian, French and Spanish material. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix spends about 60% of her time looking for new acquisitions, narrowing 
them down to the best prospects and intensely researching those that the museum 
actually buys -- about 30 a year. Her secondary commitment is to a series of 
changing exhibitions, each featuring a group of about 25 drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Though the museum's drawing collection has won high praise for its quality, it 
consists of only about 300 pieces. "We are looking for really superb examples 
by major artists and their circles of followers. We're not trying to build a 
study collection -- an extensive history of art fully representing each artist. 
We'll never have a huge collection, but on the other hand we hope it will be 
representative of the major figures. In the case of Rembrandt our drawings 
illustrate the range of his draftsmanship," Hendrix said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike widely published paintings by major artists, unknown drawings by masters 
are often squirreled away in private collections. "Each year we bring in three 
or four surprises" such as the recent purchase of unpublished drawings by 
Parmigianino, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix came to the Getty in 1985 directly after completing her Ph.D at 
Princeton University. She did her dissertation on Georg Hoefnagel's 
16th-Century "Model Book of Calligraphy," a beautifully illustrated manuscript 
on natural history in the collection of the National Gallery in Washington. At 
the time, it was the only copy in an American museum. 
</P>
<P>
"There was another copy in a private collection, but no one had seen it and we 
only knew it from photographs published in 1927," she said. "But the year I 
came to the Getty, the owner decided to sell it and, lo and behold, we bought 
it. It's an art historian's dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think that we're always planning the next grand acquisition or 
having lunch with dealers," said Kenneth Hamma, who has little time for either. 
The associate curator of antiquities had just returned from a dig in Cypress 
that he started seven years ago while he was a graduate student at Princeton 
University. The goal of the excavation, which Hamma expects to be realized in 
two more years, is to reconstruct an archeological chronology of Cyprus from 
the 6th Century BC and gain a clearer picture of how the island's civilization 
corresponds to those of surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Princeton, Hamma taught Greek and Roman art history at USC for 
five years and joined the Getty staff two years ago, but he has journeyed to 
Cypress every summer as assistant director of the Princeton excavation. The 
popular image of archeologists falls somewhere between "a grand 19th-Century 
romantic vision and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'," Hamma said. "People don't think 
about the dust, the sun or the sweat." The trade-off for grubby labor and 
"ungodly hours" is the joy of learning, the excitement of local citizens and 
the peace of having a summer without telephones, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the Getty, Hamma is conducting a study of the museum's terra cotta 
sculptures from Southern Italy, measuring a group of beautifully modeled heads 
and logging information into a computer. As the department of antiquities' 
resident computer whiz, he has written a program for cataloguing the collection 
of 10,000 objects. Many of them will come out of storage in 1992, when the 
museum's paintings and decorative arts move to the J. Paul Getty Center now 
under construction in Brentwood and the Malibu villa becomes the only museum in 
the country devoted exclusively to Greek and Roman antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
As associate director for curatorial affairs, Deborah Gribbon coordinates 
activities involving the museum's collections. She has taken on such challenges 
as earthquake preparedness at the Malibu museum and is planning the new 
galleries for the hilltop center in Brentwood. Tucked away in a cozy office at 
the museum, Gribbon claims no credit for what she calls the "truly departmental 
efforts" that she coordinates. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best examples, and one that is close to Walsh's heart, is an ongoing 
series of international scholarly symposia. Past programs on bronze sculpture 
and marble and an upcoming symposium on illuminated manuscripts bring together 
art historians, archeologists, conservators, geologists and other groups that 
generally "don't talk to each other," Walsh said. Their deliberations are 
disseminated to the field in Getty publications. 
</P>
<P>
Gribbon is looking forward to a symposium on Stone Age Cypriot art, planned for 
1990 in cooperation with Cyprus. The meeting, which will be held in conjunction 
with a small exhibition of Cypriot art and take advantage of Hamma's expertise, 
will address religion, geology, economics, conservation as well as matters of 
artistic style and subject matter. "These are very intensive meetings, 
organized around critical issues of current research and geared to a scholarly 
audience. It's a vital way of promoting scholarship," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to make connections between the collection and the public," said 
Schroeder Cherry, a museum educator who arrived at the Getty last October. "We 
want people to have an art experience in the galleries and to get away from the 
museum-as-field-trip concept." 
</P>
<P>
An artist and puppeteer, Cherry has completed his Ph.D in museum education at 
Columbia University and worked at the Studio Museum in Harlem and the New York 
City Transit, a community gallery in an old subway station. At the Getty he is 
in charge of special audiences -- the hearing impaired, the disabled, family 
groups and people with limited understanding of English. 
</P>
<P>
Engaging visitors in an impromptu talk in one gallery, Cherry pointed out 
differences between two Roman marbles, one depicting a "deliciously" carved 
little girl, the other a draped lady whose portrait head is attached to a stock 
body. His rapt audience stayed with him well beyond the typical "10-second 
look" that Cherry would like to abolish. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of getting to know your audience as well as the material," 
Cherry said. That can be a challenge in a community as diverse as Los Angeles 
and in a museum that requires its educators to impart information about its 
unusual building as well as its collections. But Cherry is undaunted, and he 
discounts the notion that the museum only attracts the elite. "We're always 
booked," he said with satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We publish 10 or 11 books a year, ranging from the popular to the highly 
obscure," said Christopher Hudson, head of publications, as he flipped through 
a table full of illustrated materials. "They are permanent, portable records of 
what the museum does." At one end of the spectrum is a handbook to the museum's 
collections that visitors buy as an aide and a souvenir; at the other are 
detailed scholarly catalogues of antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike museums that spend most of their publications budgets on catalogues of 
temporary exhibitions, the Getty concentrates on its collection. A new 
paperback series, "Getty Museum Studies in Art," takes on one work at time and 
supplies a rich literary, historical and aesthetic context. A book by curator 
Louise Lippincott on Edvard Munch's dark landscape, "Starry Night," has 
launched the series. 
</P>
<P>
"We started with one of the museum's great enigmas. Before I die I hope there 
will be a dozen of these books," Walsh said, adding that the series will deal 
with works in the collection that are "richest in associations," such as James 
Ensor's "Christ's Entry into Brussels in 1889." 
</P>
<P>
Museum publishing differs from the corporate publishing world in that about 50% 
of the publications are not books at all, Hudson said. They are posters, 
graphic designs and brochures handed out free of charge in the galleries. "But 
we do less than other museums in terms of book store merchandise -- posters, 
greeting cards, address books -- and we only do them to publicize the 
collection." 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's vast book and gift shop operation 
in New York, the Getty's bookstore is tiny -- only 300 square feet -- but it is 
very successful. "It has the highest turnover per square foot of any museum 
book store in the country," Hudson said.

Fact: Several years ago, director Lynne Littman sat in a meeting discussing 
whether her Oscar-winning documentary about old Jews in Venice could be turned 
into a fictional TV project. The network executive had only one question: "Do 
they have to be Jewish?" 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Early last year, "Anything But Love" creator Wendy Kout told one network 
programming head that she wanted Richard Lewis for the male lead opposite Jamie 
Lee Curtis. "Too Jewish," she was warned by the (Jewish) programmer. "They 
don't like us out there." 
</P>
<P>
Fact: A few seasons back, the most prominent Jewish actor in prime time was 
Michael Landon. He played an angel. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Times are changing. Today, Littman probably wouldn't be asked that 
question. Wendy Kout got Richard Lewis approved by another network, ABC, and 
"they" apparently do like him "out there." And while prime time is Anything But 
Kosher, it is featuring an increasing number of Jewish characters in new and 
interesting ways. 
</P>
<P>
No longer are they either silently Jewish ("Barney Miller") or simply fodder 
for Archie Bunker's intolerance. Now they are attractive and complex people, 
and their Jewishness is a viable and visible component. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 13 years since I've been in television, this is the first time I've 
even heard discussed having Jewish characters in series," says Lyttle, a 
producer who formerly was senior vice president of creative affairs at Warner 
Bros. Television. "Before now, if it came up, it was usually dismissed with, 
'That's just not a "relatable" character.' " 
</P>
<P>
There are some key reasons for the emergence of the prime-time Jew. First, 
Jews' assimilation into mainstream life has lessened the antipathy to, and lack 
of understanding of, things Jewish. "For a long time, there was the feeling 
that Jews represented too urban a segment of the population," says Paul Witt, 
co-executive producer of "The Golden Girls" and "Empty Nest." "There was a 
general avoidance of any real ethnicity. Now old stereotypes seem to be 
disappearing." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is the Cosby Factor. Once programmers and advertisers saw 
viewers embrace the Huxtables as America's prototypical family, "it seemed to 
make everyone in television ethnic-blind," says Larry Lyttle. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, there are now a substantial number of young Jewish men and 
women in the decision-making and top creative positions in television. 
</P>
<P>
"People of this generation approach our work differently," says Peter Noah, 
formerly co-executive producer of NBC's "Dear John" and now co-executive 
producer of "Anything But Love." "I think there was hypersensitivity among 
older Jewish writers and creators. They were afraid Jewish characters wouldn't 
be related to, so they either didn't write them or kept them bland. My 
generation feels it's more important to be true to life and our characters than 
to get 100% of the audience." 
</P>
<P>
And so we have: Richard Lewis, whose Marty Gold character is as openly Jewish 
as the actor is; Ken Olin and Melanie Mayron of "thirtysomething"; Josh 
Saviano, who plays the close young friend on "The Wonder Years"; Michael Tucker 
as Stuart Markowitz on "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
And now comes Jackie Mason starring in his own sitcom, "Chicken Soup," which 
premieres Tuesday on ABC. No one is hiding anything here -- as evidenced when 
the title was changed from the wildly innocuous "From This Moment On." 
</P>
<P>
Mason's appearance in a prime-time series is probably the key test of Will They 
or Won't They Accept Them "out there." This is the most overtly Jewish show 
since Molly Goldberg and her clan of the '50s. Since Jews comprise less than 3% 
of the total population, "Chicken Soup" may seem more daring than soothing. But 
its creators, whose instincts paid off with "Cosby" and "Roseanne," are 
confident that Mason's humor transcends his religion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's risky whenever you have a show focused on one person who speaks with a 
different voice, who has a strong point of view," says Stu Bloomberg, executive 
vice president of prime time at ABC. "But I don't think everyone who went to 
see his show on Broadway was Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
So far such confidence seems warranted. "Chicken Soup" is already being talked 
about as a likely hit, thanks in part to its berth behind "Roseanne." "We 
certainly have jumped in to buy time for our clients," says John Sisk, a senior 
vice president at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency. "Aside from its 
great time slot, we believe the show will appeal to more than a narrow 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
Prime-time series have sporadically featured Jewish characters, starting with 
"The Goldbergs," which ran from 1949 to 1954. But they have been few and far 
between and often cloaked in Gentile-alia. There was CBS' Rhoda, of course, 
played throughout the 1970s by (non-Jew) Valerie Harper. She was most 
successful as a sidekick, but she was never an easy sell, recalls co-creator 
Allan Burns: 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a meeting with a bunch of network guys where one said, 'There are 
four things people don't want to see: divorcees, people from New York, Jews and 
men with mustaches.' I guess that explains why 'Rhoda' and Tom Selleck didn't 
succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Burns also remembers one episode in which Rhoda refused to see her mother 
because she resented growing up with a family that didn't look like TV's 
Andersons and Nelsons. "The network forbade us to do the show, saying it 
emphasized the ethnicity too much. We shot it anyway and Jim Brooks and I won 
an Emmy." 
</P>
<P>
"Bridget Loves Bernie" tried to tackle the inter-marriage issue in 1972 but 
failed dismally. There were occasional Jewish characters in other series but 
the Jewishness was left ambiguous at best. Judd Hirsch says it took a few 
seasons of "Taxi" before "they eventually -- finally -- let me refer to being 
Jewish, which everyone assumed anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Writer-producer Danny Arnold says he had a tough time selling Hal Linden to the 
network for "Barney Miller." "They were very resistant to him as a leading man. 
There was supersensitivity at the time (1974) to anything ethnic. So we kept it 
very quiet once the show started. When people asked me if he was Jewish, I'd 
say, 'You don't have to think he is but don't tell me he isn't.' " 
</P>
<P>
For a period, viewers could legitimately play "Saturday Night Live's" game of 
"Jew or Not a Jew." Peter Falk was Columbo, Jack Klugman was Quincy, Judd 
Hirsch was Delvecchio, Bea Arthur was Maude Findlay. 
</P>
<P>
"When we wrote 'Maude,' we were told to write Jewish but think Gentile," says 
Bob Schiller. Schiller was once asked to go to Israel to speak on "Jews in 
Sitcoms." "I told them, 'Forget it -- that would take about two minutes,' " 
says Schiller. " 'If you want to talk about Jews running sitcoms, that could 
take two days.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are those for whom even today's promising land of prime time 
is not enough: "Jewish representation on series is still tangential," claims 
Harvey Schechter, western director of the Anti-Defamation League. "I still hear 
that Jews only play well over the Coasts. And even though Jews supposedly run 
the business, I think in some ways they are a throwback to the Goldwyns and 
Warners of the movie business. Those guys ran away from their heritage by 
changing their names. These people change their characters' names." 
</P>
<P>
They might better be called The New Assimilationists: those Jewish men and 
women who have made it up the ladder of network television. They must balance 
wanting to do stories that reflect their own identities and cultural influences 
with trying to reach the largest possible audience. "I'd like to think it's 
been a marketing decision rather than any self-loathing or perception of 
anti-Semitism that has kept Jews off prime time for so long," says Richard 
Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a majority of the top programming positions at each network are held by 
Jews. Those executives claim their religious background has nothing to do with 
whether they choose, or support, the idea of Jewish characters in series. "I 
think we all start with what's a good story and go from there," says Stu 
Bloomberg. His network, ABC, has dealt most often with the issue in prime time 
recently. Ironically, CBS, the plaything of ardent Israel supporter Lawrence 
Tisch, has no major Jewish characters on prime time. ("It's certainly not 
intentional," says a CBS spokeswoman, who offered only Candy Bergen's boss, 
Miles Silverberg, as their prime-time Jew.) 
</P>
<P>
Even those who applaud the improving situation for Jews on prime-time series 
worry somewhat about the heavily assimilationist message coming through: 
"Virtually every Jew on prime time has a non-Jewish wife," says Joseph Turow, 
associate professor at the Annenberg School of Communications. "The networks 
are still a bit wary and feel they have to make it palatable and 
non-threatening. So the higher numbers come at the cost of reinforcing the 
theme of assimilation, which is happening in our country, to be sure, but it's 
not all that's happening." 
</P>
<P>
Turow says the hope is not that all Jews on prime-time series wear yarmulkes, 
but that they at least occasionally partake in traditional Jewish habits or are 
allowed to question how much assimilation is too much. "The good news is that 
networks are allowing some producers, who have a track record of bringing in 
desirable audiences, to do pretty much what they want." 
</P>
<P>
One such innovative series is ABC's "The Wonder Years," which last season did a 
memorable episode wherein the main character, Kevin, is upset when his birthday 
coincides with the bar mitzvah of his best friend, Paul. Throughout the show, 
Paul's religion is mocked by other kids but in the end, the two friends are 
closer than ever and Kevin admits that the bar mitzvah was a lot more fun than 
his party. 
</P>
<P>
The show's executive producer, Bob Brush, insists that "The Wonder Years" is in 
no way about issues, but admits that the bar mitzvah episode generated great 
response. "I hope what we did provided something true and meaningful without 
being didactic," Brush says. "This is a coming of age show and that was a small 
part of Kevin's coming of age. I think the fact we even did such a show proves 
TV has grown up over the last few years." 
</P>
<P>
Christmas and the holidays have proved a convenient way for some programs to 
try a little Jewishness. Even on "Murphy Brown" last season, Miles insisted, "I 
don't have to feel Christmas spirit -- I'm Jewish." And he didn't stop there. 
When he decorated for a party, a menorah made a very visible appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirtysomething" has done two Christmas shows in a row that have focused on 
Michael (Ken Olin) and his non-Jewish wife Hope (Mel Harris) coming to terms 
with their differences. More importantly, they have forced Michael to explore 
his own mixed feelings about his Judaism. Last season's was the far more 
penetrating episode, ending with Michael in a synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized when we looked at the second one, that it was an intensely Jewish 
episode," says co-creator Marshall Herskovitz. "It really had to do with 
Michael's feelings about growing up Jewish. It was an inconvenient time for him 
to be so overcome with religious feelings, but he was." 
</P>
<P>
Herskovitz and partner Ed Zwick very consciously created two Jewish characters 
in their cast: Michael and his cousin Melissa, portrayed by Melanie Mayron. "It 
came out of the fact that the impetus for the show was to deal with issues 
crucial in our lives," says Herskovitz. "Hollywood has a long tradition of 
creating Jewish characters and then giving them non-Jewish names. But for 
people of this generation, the notion of hiding behind a cloak of WASPness 
makes no sense." 
</P>
<P>
"Thirtysomething" has taken some heat from Jewish groups but it makes no 
apologies. "These are highly assimilated Jews," says Herskovitz. "They're 
Americans first and their religion is not a matter of daily concern. But we 
feel we are contributing to the dialogue about how to deal with a very real 
issue today -- intermarriage." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Olin feels his character is richer for his questioning his religious 
origins: "The self-exploration into his commitment to Judaism is what makes him 
complex," Olin says. "Not just the fact that he's Jewish. He struggles with a 
lot of other self-doubts too, but it does seem unique and dramatic to see a 
leading man wearing a yarmulke (which he did at the end of the holiday 
episode). Likewise, the difference in religion is just one source of conflict 
in our marriage but it's one a lot of people can relate to." 
</P>
<P>
Like Michael, Stuart Markowitz of "L.A. Law" has gone through self-exploration 
about being Jewish. The issue came up most prominently when he had to deal with 
his wife's mother. Her not-so-subtle anti-Semitism ("I love Jewish men because 
they put their women on pedestals") prompted Markowitz to take some external 
and internal action. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of that episode, Markowitz finally asked the woman, "What has a 
Jew ever done to you?" When she said nothing, he knocked over a large piece of 
her furniture and replied, "Well, now one has." The episode closed with him 
telling his wife, "This is who I am." She basically said she wouldn't be seeing 
her mother much anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker says he received more mail from the mother-in-law episode than for any 
other. And not all positive. "One rabbi said while he applauded my emotions, he 
deplored violence," laughs Tucker. He's proud of who he is and whom he plays: 
"Markowitz's message is one of assimilation, which is pretty much my message. 
But neither does he hide from who he is, and we both become more religious than 
we thought we were when confronted by the other side." 
</P>
<P>
The creators of "L.A. Law" had Tucker in mind for his role from the outset, and 
Markowitz was a way of bringing all of the actor's qualities to a prime-time 
audience. When Wendy Kout was given her first opportunity at a prime-time 
series, "Anything But Love," she created the role of Marty and the actor came 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to create a fresh character I hadn't grown up watching on TV," says 
Kout. 
</P>
<P>
Once Richard Lewis was cast as Marty, there was certainly no hiding the Jewish 
side of him. In the very first scene of the first episode, in fact, Marty told 
Jamie Lee Curtis that he could read upside down. "That's how I learned Hebrew," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't make any attempt to hide who I am or to sound like Robert Merrill," 
says Lewis. "But neither do I wake up, roll out of bed and do the hora. It's 
part of who I am, and if it will sneak into people's consciousness, great." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, also a stand-up comic, comes from a long line of those who tried to 
preempt the pain with laughter. "We had to perform to express our Angst," he 
says. He shies away from seeing himself as a role model but admits, "I'm real 
proud to be Jewish in prime time. I feel I'm spreading some of the joys of 
being Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis may seem very Jewish for prime time but even he says, "I'm Bishop Fulton 
Sheen Lewis next to Jackie Mason." And so here comes "Chicken Soup," which its 
principals insist will appeal to a wide audience because it works and it's 
real. "The bottom line is it's funny," says Caryn Mandabach, president of 
Carsey-Werner Co., which makes the show for ABC. "But it's also about depicting 
similarities between us even while it appears to be about differences. People 
feel ennobled watching stories like that." 
</P>
<P>
The differences are played out between Mason's character and that of Lynn 
Redgrave in the ultimate "opposites attract" story. "Redgrave is there for the 
audience to respond through," says Stu Bloomberg of ABC. 
</P>
<P>
As for Mason, he's already filmed three episodes and basically is tired but 
happy. "At first I resisted the idea because I didn't want to work that hard," 
he says. "Especially since I finally felt like a vindicated hero after making 
it on Broadway. A sitcom is like prison. They told me I'd only have to work 
four days. I said no, they came back with 3 1/2, and that's what we got. It's 
far from fun." 
</P>
<P>
But Mason says they are letting him be himself and that the understanding of 
who he is is uncanny. "I don't have artistic control but they respect my 
opinions. But I don't have that much to disagree about. I feel like these 
people were in my bedroom all these years, they know me so well." 
</P>
<P>
As for his Jewishness, it is not being diluted in the least. "If anything, 
they're accentuating it," says Mason. "Ninety nine percent of people in this 
business would have tried to tone me down but not here. The theme is universal 
because it is about conflicts between people of different worlds. I've got a 
Jewish mother; (Redgrave's character) has got a brother who hates Jews. I'm an 
old-style, unsophisticated New York Jew and she's a cultured Gentile. It's 
about trying to find a common ground." 
</P>
<P>
It's still not a time of perfect clarity on prime time when it comes to Jews, 
however. Take "Dear John." Its star, Judd Hirsch, who has never hidden his 
religion, says he presumes his character is Christian because one episode dealt 
with him and his ex-wife trying to get their child into a church school. 
</P>
<P>
But that comes to a surprise to some of the writers of the show. "It's odd Judd 
would say that," says Peter Noah. "Around the writers' tables, we always 
figured you can't hide Judd's Jewishness, so we made the wife the more emphatic 
one on that episode. That way we figured people would see it as a mixed 
marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch says he goes out of his way to mix things up in his career: "Like most 
actors, I don't want to be typecast. And I have this second thing. I don't want 
to be typecast as a Jew. On this show, it doesn't matter. Would people watch if 
it were 'Dear Yissel'? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Such a show may very well happen if "Chicken Soup" clicks. After all, the 
bottom line in network television is the bottom line, and the industry rarely 
shies away from imitation. So stay tuned: You may soon be hearing, "Tonight . . 
. Shecky Greene joins the cast of 'Dallas.' "

TV &amp; REALITY AS THE LINE BLURS

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This is war. 
</P>
<P>
British troops -- from the Scots Guards, Gurkhas, King's Own Borderers, Royal 
Irish Rangers, Queen's Regiment, Parachute Regiment and other units -- are in a 
battle. Faces blackened and wearing camouflage gear, they slither along the 
ground to avoid lethal booby traps and use light machine guns, mortars and 
antitank guns to hit the enemy and knock out military targets. 
</P>
<P>
These are real troops using real ammunition in such real locales as England, 
Wales and Scotland. This is war, all right, but not real war. 
</P>
<P>
This is television. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a much broader sense, perhaps the future of television in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The troops are fighting it out in "Combat," a British series (no relation to 
ABC's "Combat" series of the 1960s) that has turned an actual military training 
exercise into entertainment, tailoring it to TV and carving it into seven 
programs with the blessing of the Ministry of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
A sort of "Battle of the Network Stars" with live ammunition? No. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers were "adapted slightly for the needs of television," said a 
spokesman for Central Television, the production company behind "Combat," which 
aired on England's Independent Television earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is very real," Phil Pilley, the show's creator, said from London. "We 
didn't organize this. This is a legitimate Army exercise in which an element of 
competition is introduced." 
</P>
<P>
Although there is a spirited rivalry among British military units, the opposing 
troops don't attack or fire at each other. Instead, this is a sort of war game 
show, with soldier teams from the various units competing to see which is best 
at executing the maneuvers, with the winning team receiving $7,800 from 
"Combat." 
</P>
<P>
There are male and female co-hosts to narrate the conflict and conduct postwar 
interviews, and a sound track of military music is inserted to keep viewers' 
adrenalin flowing. 
</P>
<P>
If "Combat" is renewed, Pilley would like to extend it at least to the Royal 
Navy and Air Force and perhaps even foreign troops. The mind boggles at the 
possibilities. NATO vs. the Warsaw Pact? It could outdraw even soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to end it with something worldwide," said Pilley, sounding a little 
like Dr. Strangelove. 
</P>
<P>
It beats actual war. But is this -- the meshing of reality and entertainment to 
a point where the two may become indistinguishable -- where television is 
headed in the '90s? It seems so in America, at least, as the evidence mounts. 
</P>
<P>
Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds" broadcast made radio history in 1938 by using 
news-reporting techniques that inadvertently persuaded many listeners that the 
United States was actually being invaded by Mars. As one frightened man 
recalled: "We just sat there holding hands, expecting any minute to see those 
Martian monsters appear over the tops of the trees." 
</P>
<P>
The process is not new to TV, either. Flash back to 1953-57 and "You Are 
There": 
</P>
<P>
Walter Cronkite anchors a CBS News series on Sunday nights that re-creates 
events in history through scripted interviews and reports from actual 
correspondents in the field. Cronkite signs off each program the same way: 
"What sort of a day was it? A day like all days, filled with those events that 
alter and illuminate our times . . . and you were there." 
</P>
<P>
An entertainment program that looked and sounded like a news program, "You Are 
There" was an early forerunner of a mixed-format genre that, ignited a decade 
ago by NBC's "Real People," was to explode in popularity through the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The momentum continues today as, increasingly, "you are there" again and again 
and again, confronted by TV's disorienting never-never land of quasi-reality 
and quasi-fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
This time the Martian monsters are dressed like program executives. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the 1989-90 season, the list of TV's so-called nationally distributed 
"infotainment" programs is long and getting longer. Take this: 
</P>
<P>
"PM Magazine," "Entertainment Tonight," "A Current Affair," "USA Today on 
Television," "Inside Edition," "America's Most Wanted," "Unsolved Mysteries" 
and the new "Rescue 911," "Hard Copy," "Inside Report" and" Crimewatch 
Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Add to these programs the network news division productions: "60 Minutes," 
"20/20," "48 Hours," the new "PrimeTime Live" and "Yesterday, Today &amp; 
Tomorrow" and the coming "Saturday Night With Connie Chung" (formerly "West 
57th"). 
</P>
<P>
The enormous cumulative impact of these programs cannot be lightly dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent Gallup poll conducted for Times Mirror, TV's 
magazine-format shows are confusing the public about what is news and what is 
entertainment. For example, 39% of those polled believed "A Current Affair" to 
be news, while 28% considered it entertainment. The figures were 36% news and 
14% entertainment for the syndicated "Inside Edition" and 50% news and 28% 
entertainment for Fox Broadcasting's "America's Most Wanted," which uses 
dramatic re-creations to depict crimes. 
</P>
<P>
This is frightening, for when viewers become seduced by TV's aura of 
authenticity, the potential exists for the medium's distorted reality to become 
society's reality. The unknown is whether TV-influenced perceptions are offset 
by family, peers, school, religion and other influences. 
</P>
<P>
Less and less, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
"Younger people, who are lighter consumers of news and who were weaned on 
television rather than newspapers, were much more apt to perceive . . . 
'America's Most Wanted' as news and not entertainment," the Times Mirror study 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 49% of those polled approved the use of re-enactments in news 
programs if properly labeled, compared to 44% holding the opposite view. 
Interestingly, 64% of the respondents under 30 favored re-enactments, compared 
with only 35% of those in the 50-plus age group. 
</P>
<P>
The inevitable conclusion from the poll is that viewers born after TV emerged 
as a popular medium in the late 1940s are the most receptive to its arsenal of 
disorienting devices, which punctuate the entire broadcast day. 
</P>
<P>
In daytime, for example, six law series with varying levels of reality are 
available to Los Angeles-area viewers, together becoming a numbing blur. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "On Trial": Footage of actual criminal-court proceedings, shrunk to 22 
minutes for TV and introduced by an anchor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "People's Court": Real judge, real plaintiffs and real cases, but argued in 
a TV studio and limited to 11 minutes each to accommodate TV. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Divorce Court": Real judge and real attorneys, but clients are actors and 
cases scripted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Superior Court": Real judge, but attorneys and other principals are 
actors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Judge" and the new "Trial by Jury": All actors. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, aren't they all? There are times when you have the feeling that, no 
matter their profession, everyone on TV is an actor and the gap separating 
reality and fantasy has narrowed to a barely discernible fissure. Examples 
abound: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In his 1988 syndicated documentary "American Expose: Who Killed JFK?," 
muckraking columnist Jack Anderson used a dramatic re-creation to depict 
conversations he said he had years ago with a prominent mobster. The mobster 
was played by an actor. Anderson was played by . . . Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only recently, ABC News used actors on "World News Tonight" to depict 
suspected spy Felix S. Bloch secretly handing over information to a Soviet 
agent at a meeting in Paris that ABC was told occurred but didn't witness. 
</P>
<P>
 -- TV-wise, the Reagan White House years were typified by multitudes of photo 
opportunities showing the Chief Executive greeting visiting dignitaries (with a 
ban on questions from reporters) and looking Presidential in the Oval Office, 
creating the carefully orchestrated "reality" of Reagan being firmly in 
command. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Typically, last year's presidential campaign trail was a continuous stage 
on which candidates from both parties performed TV-tailored stunts designed by 
their professional image-makers and media manipulators. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some news documentaries are sprinkled with excerpts from movies and TV 
series, creating nice production values, but also more confusion by using 
fictional scenes to underpin and substantiate factual news reporting. 
</P>
<P>
One could argue that regardless of intent, topic or material, TV makes its own 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly TV news does, by virtue of its philosophy and self-imposed time 
limitations. That philosophy calls for presenting news mostly as a series of 
hiccups -- thereby distorting reality through shrinkage. It also calls, locally 
at least, for a panorama of crime stories that wind up fueling paranoia far out 
of proportion to the actual community threat. 
</P>
<P>
With a news hole of only 22 minutes remaining after commercials, moreover, no 
network newscast can begin to adequately cover everything that should be 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
Like the tree that falls in the forest unnoticed, therefore, news uncovered by 
television doesn't exist for the multitudes who learn about the world primarily 
from the small screen. 
</P>
<P>
Some important stories go uncovered not because of the time factor, however, 
but because they are not accessible to the camera and can't be supported by 
pictures. Hence, TV's reality excludes them, too. 
</P>
<P>
The anchors themselves become prime players in this skewed truth. On a network 
level, they're news stars whose presence on a story -- or absence from one -- 
conveys to viewers that story's alleged importance or unimportance. If Dan 
Rather or Peter Jennings or Tom Brokaw are there, it has to be big. If they're 
not there, it has to be small. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the message conveyed to viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Anchors are theater in quite another way as well. As chief reporter for the 
recent NBC documentary "Gangs, Cops and Drugs," set mostly in Los Angeles, 
Brokaw was shown on the city's mean streets, getting the real scoop from gang 
members. It was impressive and may have gotten Brokaw some new viewers for "NBC 
Nightly News." But wasn't this, too, a form of artificiality, a pretense that 
meaningful dialogue was possible, with a famous anchorman interviewing gang 
members out in the open in front of a TV camera? 
</P>
<P>
The reality of the moment was shaped not only by the presence of Brokaw, but 
also by the presence of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of the camera, what of "Cops," the documentary-style Fox series 
that purports to show truth by recording police in the line of duty? Turn on 
the camera and voila, a series that feeds TV's ravenous appetite for action and 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
It's riveting TV. Are we to believe, however, that the police are oblivious to 
the camera and not influenced by its presence? Do they always slap hands when 
making a big bust, as Broward County, Fla. sheriff's deputies did in the 
presence of the "Cops" camera? Did the camera just happen to be present -- out 
on a boat -- when a male cop proposed to a female cop? 
</P>
<P>
Information and entertainment merge not only on the small screen but also in 
the backgrounds of many of the key production people behind "infotainment" 
programs, as if these people had become living embodiments of their 
contributions to TV. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the syndicated series "Hard Copy," which debuts locally 
Sept. 18 on KCBS-TV Channel 2 and which co-anchor Alan Frio says is designed to 
"complement local and national news": 
</P>
<P>
On one producer's resume, productions with Bob Hope and Della Reese surface 
alongside news specials and documentaries. Another person's credits range from 
specialty videos to Cable News Network. And another worked on rock music videos 
and "Soul Train" before becoming a local news producer/director. 
</P>
<P>
Although surely impressive for career purposes, such pedigrees are a metaphor 
for the perilous route television seems to be following into the age of the 
'90s, where viewer confusion will prevail and reality will be what you make of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
That too is the message of "Combat," where soldiers are not only soldiers, but 
now also are beamed coast to coast in England as stars of their own action 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Would "Combat" work in the United States? Why not? 
</P>
<P>
All's fair in war and television.

THE STONES: JUST ROLLING ON NOSTALGIA?; 
</P>
<P>
ALREADY A HIT, THE TOUR NOW AIMS AT PROVING BAND'S RELEVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even after all these years, nothing shakes the rock world like a Rolling Stones 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
The Who may be as prized by hard-core rock fans, and it may have sold out as 
many concerts (two) at 56,000-seat Veterans Stadium here this year, but the 
Stones generate more heat, especially outside the rock world. 
</P>
<P>
Both bands landed on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine with their tours, but 
only the Stones made the cover of Time. 
</P>
<P>
And there was no contest in terms of how many people were willing to shell out 
big bucks, according to Philadelphia ticket brokers. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand for Stones tickets was so much greater. It was like the Who never 
happened," said a spokesman for Entertainment Plus, a local broker. Chris 
Lipton, owner of Good Time Tickets, agreed. "The most brokers around town were 
getting for top Who tickets was around $200. With the Stones, you could double 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Similar excitement is expected on most of the stops on a 36-city stadium tour 
that will be seen by an estimated 3 million people before it ends in 
mid-December. That figure includes nearly 150,000 for Oct. 21 and 22 shows at 
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating this demand, the tour's promoter, Michael Cohl, president of BCL 
Entertainment Corp., reportedly guaranteed the Stones more than $65 million to 
do the tour. At an average ticket price of $28.50, the concerts will gross 
approximately $85.5 million at the box office alone. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just the beginning. T-shirt and merchandising income from the tour 
(applying the industry norm of $12 per person for a stadium tour) could bring 
in another $36 million. There will be additional millions from a pay-per-view 
TV special at the end of the tour and a "fashion clothing collection" due this 
fall from the Brockum Group, a division of BCL. The Stones line will include 
jackets, shorts, sneakers, sweat shirts and various accessories -- all designed 
under the direction of Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts. 
</P>
<P>
As Keith Richards asked in a pre-tour interview, "Why is everyone making such a 
fuss about a bunch of middle-aged madmen on tour?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer, in large part, can be traced to the appeal of the Stones' body of 
work -- a history of great singles that stretches from "Satisfaction" and "Get 
Off My Cloud" to "Tumbling Dice" and "Start Me Up," as well as less consistent, 
but occasionally magnificent albums. "Exile on Main Street," the band's 1972 
two-record set, has frequently been hailed as the all-time rock album. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another reason for all the interest in the Stones, and it's an 
issue that faces a lot of veteran bands these days: the nostalgia factor. 
</P>
<P>
You can almost see Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, both of whom will be 46 by 
the end of the year, wincing at the term. 
</P>
<P>
Nostalgia is a quaint enough concept under most circumstances. No one objects 
to the nostalgic overtones at an old-timers' baseball game. Fans love the 
chance to cheer once more for Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax and the 
other great names from sport's past. 
</P>
<P>
But nostalgia is an unsettling term in rock 'n' roll -- the idea that music, 
rather than speaking to you in a new way, simply encourages you to reminisce 
about what the songs once meant to you. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the real test of this tour isn't how many tickets the Stones will sell 
-- that issue was largely a foregone conclusion before the shows were put on 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge of this tour is whether the Stones, after a quarter-century, can 
be more than nostalgia. If they can, the Stones will accomplish something that 
has eluded virtually all the band's own earlier rock heroes. 
</P>
<P>
The great fear connected to aging in rock hasn't turned out to be expanding 
waistlines or receding hairlines, but being viewed as nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
That term has long been a buzz word, like "Las Vegas" or "lounge act," to the 
revolutionary young rockers of the '60s -- the symbol of show-biz hacks, or at 
least the end of the creative line. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Mick Jagger insisted on a new album to accompany the Stones' first 
U.S. tour in eight years was to combat the nostalgia inherent in doing just 
your oldies, a la the Who shows. 
</P>
<P>
While the Stones performed only three songs from the new album, "Steel Wheels," 
in the tour's opening shows here, more songs from the album will be added to 
the set as the tour proceeds around North America. Meanwhile, the band has 
carefully designed the show to make sure all aspects of the Stones' past are 
represented in the song selection -- not just the most nostalgia-rich mid-'60s. 
</P>
<P>
The 28 songs performed by the Stones on opening night Aug. 31 included seven 
from the mid-'60s (including "Satisfaction" and "Paint It Black"), five from 
the especially creative late-'60s period ("Honky Tonk Women," "You Can't Always 
Get What You Want"), nine from the '70s ("Brown Sugar," "Dead Flowers") and 
seven from the '80s. Six of the latter, including "Undercover of the Night" and 
"Harlem Shuffle," were recorded after the 1981 tour, and thus hadn't been 
performed before in concert. 
</P>
<P>
Richards acknowledged the nostalgia issue in interviews when he outlined the 
challenges facing the Stones at this point in the band's career. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock 'n' roll is still only about 32 years old and it is still getting over 
its (preoccupation) with teen-age themes. The Stones are in a good position to 
help it grow up." 
</P>
<P>
Inherent in Richards' statement is an anti-nostalgia provision. To "grow up," 
the Stones have to find a way to avoid the nostalgia tendencies of so many of 
their '60s counterparts and virtually all of their '50s predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
As great as they once were, almost every important '50s rock act has been 
reduced to nostalgia. It's true of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Fats Domino, Carl 
Perkins. The artists haven't progressed. They simply go on stage night after 
night and do the old songs pretty much the same way they always have done them. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a lot of '60s acts, including the Beach Boys and the Four Seasons, 
have become extensions of this nostalgia mentality. They both tend to treat the 
music as hits rather than art. 
</P>
<P>
The revolutionary thing about post-'50s rock is that the best artists -- from 
Bob Dylan and the Who's Pete Townshend to the Beatles and the Stones, from 
David Bowie and Bruce Springsteen to Prince and U2 -- approach rock as a medium 
as capable as literature or film of exploring social and personal issues in an 
artful way. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Dylan's shows have suggested that material, even though in 
rock it has often seemed tied to the pulse of a specific generation, can live 
on and touch new generations. Dylan has also combatted nostalgia by dressing 
songs up with new arrangements, a move that has frequently led to cries of foul 
from his more tradition-minded fans. 
</P>
<P>
The recent Who tour was another encouraging sign that veteran rock artists can 
sidestep nostalgia. As the band demonstrated, quality material can resist the 
nostalgia tendencies, especially if presented with a sense of continued passion 
and if the artist feels free to reinterpret the material. But the Who tour, for 
all the majesty of the Townshend songs, was a limited victory, a holding action 
of sorts, because it didn't deal with the issue of new material. 
</P>
<P>
That's what adds an extra dimension to the Stones tour. There's not only new 
material, but a different attitude. Where the Who all but came on stage with 
their hands in the air saying don't be too hard on us because we aren't, after 
all, pretending to be a competitive band anymore, the Stones came out here with 
guns blazing. 
</P>
<P>
They demanded to be judged by the same standards that would be applied to any 
new band. They wanted to show that musicians over 40 could compete and the 
songs could still connect. 
</P>
<P>
The point wasn't lost on critics here, and the notices were uniformly positive. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times' Jon Pareles noted: "In a summer of reunion tours, the 
Stones can't rest on their fans' nostalgia -- and they don't have to. Under the 
stadium trappings is a band that still kicks, hard." 
</P>
<P>
Agreed Edna Gundersen in USA Today: "There's no rust gathering under these 
wheels. . . . No mere 'retrospective,' the Stones have geared this boisterous 
and bludgeoning show for the present tense." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Takiff, writing in the Philadelphia Daily News, concluded: "The 
Rolling Stones set out to make a grand statement with this show: that they're 
alive and relevant to today's audience and today's music. Last night, they 
proved the point." 
</P>
<P>
The Stones can do even more on the rest of the tour to combat nostalgia 
tendencies than the band did in the two shows here. Some songs in the set don't 
hold up, so they tend to connect only on a nostalgia level. Some songs are no 
longer relevant because they are tied to images (the sinister Stones of the 
"Midnight Rambler" period) or because the songs are simply too slight ("Play 
With Fire"). 
</P>
<P>
In their place, the Stones could offer some of the more wistful and 
introspective songs that reflect the changes in the band members' lives and 
attitudes since the bad-boy days -- songs such as "Black Limousine" from the 
"Tattoo You" album or "Slipping Away" from the new album. 
</P>
<P>
But the band ultimately can do only so much to control the nostalgia issue. The 
fans, too, play a part. One reason the '50s acts have kept doing the old hits 
the old way is that the fans don't demand more. 
</P>
<P>
At most '50s oldies shows, in fact, fans seem more intent on celebrating an era 
than saluting a particular artist. It doesn't seem to matter all that much 
which of the stars are on a given bill, or even if the original members of a 
group are singing the tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the older fans in the Veterans Stadium audience, too, seemed to look at 
music chiefly as a way to reminisce about the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Perry, 41, said she paid a broker $75 each for two Stones tickets just to 
hear the old songs. "It was great," she said after the opening-night concert. 
"I just wish they would have done more of the older songs, like 'Let's Spend 
the Night Together.' To tell the truth, I didn't even know they were still 
making new albums. I don't follow rock much anymore. The last concert I went to 
see was the Moody Blues." 
</P>
<P>
But Perry seemed the exception. For one thing, the over-30 segment was 
outnumbered. As much as 75% of the two crowds at Veterans Stadium appeared to 
consist of teen-agers, and the theme that emerged from interviews with more 
than two dozen of them each day was that they view the Stones as still 
contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a Stones fan since I started listening to my brother's Stones 
records five or six years ago," said Tony DeFazio, 17. "But it's not like I'm 
coming to see a 'golden oldies' act. I like their new stuff, too." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Pollinas, 14, added: "A lot of today's bands were recorded before I was 
listening to records. . . . Van Halen, Aerosmith, Def Leppard, maybe even 
Motley Crue, and no one calls them nostalgia acts. You could put 'Start Me Up' 
or any of the Stones records on the radio today and they'd still sound great. 
It's the music I'm interested in, not the age of the band." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Morrison, 17, said he likes a lot of '60s music, including the Beatles, 
Led Zeppelin and the Doors. But he said he puts the Stones in a different 
category because the group is still active. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, it's not just their '60s songs that I like," he added as he put on a 
tour T-shirt, the one with the bright red tongue logo on the front. "I didn't 
like the last album much, but I liked Keith Richards' solo album a lot." 
</P>
<P>
But are the older Stones songs at all relevant to today's teens? 
</P>
<P>
Chris Barden, 17, nodded vigorously when asked that question. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," he said, sitting at the end of the stadium opposite from the 
stage. "Lots of Stones songs express how I feel at different times. Take here 
tonight," he said, smiling. "The song that I think of is 'You Can't Always Get 
What You Want' because what I want is a ticket up near the stage, and here I am 
in the back of the stadium."

JAZZ: IS HE BLUE? LOU RAWLS BACK TO HIS ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lou Rawls has nothing to sing the blues about -- precisely because that is what 
he did on his new album. 
</P>
<P>
His album "At Last" (Blue Note 91937), liberally sprinkled with the blues and 
jazz elements that marked his entry into the record world almost 30 years ago, 
is riding high. Last week it was No. 5 with a bullet on the contemporary jazz 
chart. On Wednesday he will be one-third of the "Hollywood Bowl Full of Blues" 
concert along with Joe Williams and Etta James. 
</P>
<P>
Back home in Los Angeles last week after his second Japanese tour in two 
months, he explained how the apparent change of direction came about. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Bruce Lundvall when he was the head of Epic and I was with an 
affiliated label, Philly International. Later on Bruce went with Manhattan 
Records. He told me, 'I'm taking over Blue Note, which is part of the Manhattan 
group. Would you have eyes to do something there?' I said sure, so he put me 
together with the producers, Michael Cuscuna and Billy Vera, and we started 
picking out material." 
</P>
<P>
The change was not made casually; Rawls had been studying the market and felt 
the time was right. "There is a real resurgence as far as jazz and blues and 
good music are concerned. The jazz market hit the dust when they went 
avant-garde in the '70s. A guy would get up and play for 20 minutes and he'd 
say, 'That was "Blue Moon," ' and you didn't even know it! But now you've got 
your Wynton Marsalises and people like that who are bringing it back to basics. 
</P>
<P>
"As for the blues, it's never been away. The B. B. Kings and Albert Kings and 
Bobby Blands will always be around. And lately I've noticed that when I would 
reach back and sing some of the things out of my old Capitol Records days like 
'Tobacco Road' and 'Black and Blue,' the crowd would go wild. In fact, at 
Capitol, which is now part of the same family as Blue Note, they're repackaging 
my old 'Stormy Monday' album with Les McCann." 
</P>
<P>
Rawls makes a valid point that the teen-agers of the 1960s, when these albums 
were current, are now adults with children of their own who grew up around 
those sounds. "The kids have gotten to the point where the electronic 
bombardment has reached its peak. Of course, your teeny-boppers are still into 
that wild, frenzied heavy-metal stuff, but the older ones from 17 or 18 up are 
ready for a difference, a release and they're finding it in some of these 
sounds they used to hear their parents play." 
</P>
<P>
This is Rawls' second step back into the area that first nurtured him, but the 
first to be released. "I made a blues album, with a small jazz group backing, 
for MGM Records in 1973, but Mike Curb was in charge there, and after I'd done 
it, he decided that wasn't the direction they wanted to take. It was never 
issued, and I guess it's still in the can. After that I left MGM -- and Mike 
Curb left to become a politician." (The MGM catalogue now belongs to Polygram.) 
</P>
<P>
Beefing up the potential for the new album was a galaxy of guest artists. Rawls 
had no trouble securing Ray Charles for their duet cut ("That's Where It's 
At"), since this was a quid pro quo. "I did a number on Ray's last album, 
called 'Save the Bones for Henry Jones,' so he was happy to do this for me. As 
for George Benson, we'd been talking for years about doing something together, 
so it was a kick for both of us to have him singing and playing on 'You Can't 
Go Home.' 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, most of the people I have as special soloists, like the saxophonist 
-- Stanley Turientine, David Fathead Newman and Bobby Watson -- as well as the 
vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson -- really jumped at the idea of being part of 
this. If I'd told them it was going to be a Philly International commercial 
thing, they might not have gone for it." 
</P>
<P>
Along with all these soloists, Rawls had a fellow Blue Note artist, Dianne 
Reeves, who was in rare form joining forces with him on the title tune, as well 
as on the old Nellie Lutcher novelty song "Fine Brown Frame." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Japanese tours (which included a nostalgic reunion with his 
old Capitol compadre, the pianist Les McCann), Rawls has played European jazz 
festivals -- the kinds of dates where he might have seemed out of place during 
his "commercial" days: Montreux, the North Sea Festival, the Grande Parade de 
Jazz at Nice. 
</P>
<P>
The public response has been so strong that next year Rawls expects to work the 
full jazz festival circuit. His only problem has been resistance from some 
American radio stations. "We've had people saying, 'Oh, that's jazz, we can't 
use it' -- and they haven't even listened to it. 
</P>
<P>
"When you come right down to reality, I've tried to maintain my identity 
through everything I've done. Sure, I've had strings and full orchestrations on 
a lot of things, but my style of delivery hasn't altered. 
</P>
<P>
"The stories that songs tell are pretty much alike -- about your heart being 
broken or you can't pay the rent or whatever. You think country and Western is 
gonna change? No! Blues ain't gonna change, jazz ain't gonna change -- well, 
they tried to change it with that avant-garde and you see what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"It's weird, man, but it's fun. I'm having a good time. I've been called a jazz 
singer, blues singer, folk singer, rock singer, pop singer, message singer, 
soul singer, fusion singer, and now I'm a jazz singer again. Full circle!"

THE NEW VIEW FROM THE TOP AT MCA RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Teller, who took over last week from Irving Azoff as the chairman of the MCA 
Music Entertainment Group, sat in his Universal City office after his 
appointment and spoke wistfully about the coming of the 1990s and the possible 
effect on some of pop's legendary figures. 
</P>
<P>
 He reminisced about loving such artists as Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones and 
the Beatles so much two decades ago that he charged scores of albums at the 
student store while attending the Harvard School of Business. But Teller (shown 
in the MCA Records offices at right) wonders now if the return this year of 
many of these artists isn't a last hurrah -- at least as major record sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (this return) is great for all of us who grew up with them, but when 
1990 finally comes, it (may be) the final nail in the '60s," the bearded Teller 
said, sitting at his desk in a corner office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not for a moment denigrating their talent or their ability to continue to 
make great music. I'm talking about their role in the industry as sellers of 
huge numbers of albums. Every generation wants to discover its own heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 In his new position, Teller, 45, stands as one of the industry's key players 
in the search for those new heroes. A New York native who is married with a 
15-year-old son, Teller started in the record business 20 years ago as 
assistant to the president of CBS Records Division. He later served briefly as 
president of United Artists Records and Windsong Records before returning in 
1981 to long-time industry leader CBS Records, where he was eventually named 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving CBS early last year in what he describes only as a "difference of 
opinion" with CBS Records head Walter Yetnikoff, Teller was named president and 
chief operating officer of the MCA record group which had become an industry 
force once more under Azoff's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Teller's arrival, the record division -- which grossed $661 million in 
1988 -- has had an especially impressive year, registering at one point last 
summer, the top three positions on Billboard magazine's album sales chart. 
While Azoff was still at MCA, it was difficult for outsiders to know who was 
running the show. But now that Azoff has resigned to form his own music-related 
company, it's clearly Teller's operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview about his plans for MCA Records, Teller spoke in a rapid, 
forceful, confident manner: 
</P>
<P>
Question: What did you bring philosophically from CBS to MCA? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I think there was a sense of tradition at CBS . . . that it was the 
Tiffany of the record business, totally committed to great talent. Everything 
we did was in service of and for our artists. I think that is still the only 
way to run a record company. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But what about the reality of making a profit? 
</P>
<P>
A: Part of the trick of running one of these companies is to strike the 
appropriate balance. . . . I still, however, subscribe completely to the idea 
of pursuing the best, most unique talent you can find and not worrying about 
how you are going to get the records on the radio. You can deal with radio (and 
marketing) later. Don't let the business mechanisms dictate what your artistic 
vision should be. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In coming to MCA, were you concerned about working for such a strong, 
high-profiled individual as Azoff? 
</P>
<P>
A: I've worked for a lot of high profile people . . . Clive Davis, Walter 
Yetnikoff, Jerry Weintraub. This is a high profile business. I thought the idea 
of coming here and helping build the company to the next level was exciting and 
offered me a chance to get closer to the street. A big part of running CBS was 
administrative, and frankly, I didn't go into the music business to be an 
administrator. I'm pleased at the way things have gone. We've had tremendous 
success over the last 12 months, highlighted, I guess, by the weeks we had 
albums one, two and three in Billboard. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You're referring to the Bobby Brown, Fine Young Cannibals and Tom Petty 
albums. Could you use the Brown album as an example to show us your role in 
motivating the company? 
</P>
<P>
A: After we worked out a deal last year, I asked Irving to send me all the 
albums and all the videos so I could get a sense of what was going on at the 
company. The Brown album completely floored me. It was already up to about 
300,000 or 400,000 units at the time, but I thought we could go a lot further. 
</P>
<P>
When I came out here from New York and had my first marketing meeting, I said, 
"I believe we can sell 5 million copies of the album. Let's figure out how to 
do it." We had numerous meetings and laid out a solid, one-year campaign. 
</P>
<P>
When we had the opportunity of doing the "Ghostbusters II" sound track, the 
first person we thought of (for the album) was Bobby. The idea was to take time 
out from releasing singles from his own album to release a Bobby single from 
the film. This would give him a chance to reach a whole different audience. His 
album is about 5 1/2 million now. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what I am supposed to do is stimulate (the staff's) thinking -- try to 
give everyone a general sense of direction. I don't mean taking an album that 
you think will sell only 12 copies and say, 'We are going to sell 10 million of 
it.' But it is important to set an (ambitious) vision because everybody gets 
excited and (the project) becomes a mission. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you feel MCA's standing in the industry is strong enough for you to 
compete with any label for new talent? Have MCA's legal problems had any 
(adverse) effect on signing new acts? 
</P>
<P>
A: (In an interview after resigning, Azoff complained about having spent months 
embroiled in a federal investigation and legal actions that grew out of the 
record company's involvement with Salvatore Pisello, who represented MCA in the 
sale of discount records early during Azoff's tenure. Pisello was subsequently 
convicted of income tax evasion and was identified in a government prosecutor's 
sentencing memorandum as having long-standing ties to organized crime groups. 
No MCA executive was ever charged in the probe, and Pisello has denied the 
claims of organized crime ties.) 
</P>
<P>
I absolutely feel we are competitive with anybody because any astute manager is 
going to be looking for enthusiasm and commitment. This company has all the 
resources, financial and otherwise, necessary. I'm very optimistic about our 
future. We are already a premier label for black music and for country music, 
and we are being very aggressive in bringing the rest of our line up to that 
level. Our A &amp; R people are being very aggressive, signing a lot of good, 
young rock bands. (Regarding the legal matters) It's a total non-issue. All we 
have been talking to our artists and managers about is making music . . . and 
making careers. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does it make more sense for MCA Records to sign established, big-name acts 
at high prices or concentrate on building new talent? 
</P>
<P>
A: There was a time when it was considered a badge of courage if you could 
steal a superstar from another label, but to me, that was more a macho exercise 
</P>
<P>
than a practical (business) move. You can probably come up with some reasons 
why it would be appropriate at a particular place and time to go after a 
veteran act -- maybe you are a new label and you want to make a splash and show 
you are a major player. But ultimately the success or failure of a record 
company is going to be its ability to find and break new talent. Overpaying for 
a veteran artist is a major mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you go about finding the "next great thing?" 
</P>
<P>
A: At the risk of making a generalization in a business where generalizations 
tend to become disastrous traps, the "next great thing" is usually something 
that is very different from the current great thing. That's because it has got 
to be a radical shift -- a left turn or a right turn -- and not just another 
notch in (the same) direction. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you think the '80s produced as many lasting superstars as the '60s and 
'70s? 
</P>
<P>
A: My guess is there will be fewer true superstars to emerge from the '80s. One 
reason is video. I don't want to denigrate music video. I'm still a fan of them 
if they are used properly, but there is no free lunch with any of this and 
perhaps one of the handicaps of music videos is they have lessened the 
(motivation for young bands to be great live acts). 
</P>
<P>
If you go back to the covered wagon days of the '60s and '70s, part of breaking 
an artist was touring that artist, club to club, city to city, so people could 
see the artist and spread the word. Now that (exposure) is done primarily 
through videos and that is a highly controlled environment. With videos, you 
can redo the song and edit it, etc. That's why artists have been able to come 
from being unknown to selling 2, 3 million copies without having to go through 
the important step of playing and winning fans live. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about musical trends in the '90s? Think rap will continue to grow as an 
influence? 
</P>
<P>
A: Rap is the only new pop musical form to emerge in the '80s and it will 
continue to be important in the '90s and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did you think it was just a fad at first? 
</P>
<P>
A: Quite the opposite. It was my belief in the importance of rap that led to 
the signing in 1983 of the Def Jam (distribution deal which gave CBS a major 
foothold in the rap scene, including such acts the Beastie Boys and LL Cool J). 
It was considered a shocking signing at the time because rap was still 
considered an inner-city, ghetto phenomenon, with no crossover potential 
whatsoever. But if you happened to be in New York and walking down the street, 
you heard rap everywhere and kids were getting off on it. It didn't make sense 
to assume that it was going to somehow stay bottled up in the black, inner-city 
community forever. So I was determined to get into that . . . even though I 
heard people talking about the deal as "Teller's Folly." 
</P>
<P>
This is a business of judgments and if you can't step up to the plate and take 
a whack at something you believe in, then you shouldn't be in this game. . . . 
you're not a player.

KADAFI, BESET AT HOME AND ABROAD, TURNS TO CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TRIPOLI, Libya 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chunks of twisted ceiling panels litter the entrance hall in what was once 
Libya's grandest villa. Paintings tilt crazily above overturned sofas. 
Upstairs, a child's bloodstained mattress is encased in a glass shroud. 
</P>
<P>
This is at once Moammar Kadafi's former residence and a shrine to Libya's 
enduring rage -- a site where young Libyan soldiers and foreign dignitaries are 
shuttled through by the busload to ensure that they will not forget the night 
of April 14, 1986, when American bombs rained down on Tripoli and Benghazi four 
hours before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
In the months that followed the raid -- which, according to Kadafi, killed his 
adopted daughter and injured his son -- the contentious, obsessive, 
vision-struck Libyan leader, who had plowed like a solitary tank across the 
world stage for a decade and a half, was left shellshocked. 
</P>
<P>
Economic sanctions by the United States and severe travel restrictions by 
Western Europe were bottling up the Libyan economy. A difficult war in 
neighboring Chad was eating up a reported $1 billion a year and spurring 
growing unease at home. Borders on two sides were shut from years of feuding 
with Arab neighbors. Opposition abroad was mounting, and even loyal Libyans at 
home were growing increasingly restless over boarded-up shop windows and long 
lines for staples such as meat and bread. The longtime proponent of Arab unity, 
for once, found himself almost utterly alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in '86 he must have realized that if he continued on in this way, he 
was bound for disaster," said one Western diplomat posted in Tripoli. "Quite 
simply, he realized he couldn't go on like this." 
</P>
<P>
Now, concluding a week of celebrations marking the 20th anniversary of his 
revolution, Kadafi is riding an unparalleled charm offensive that has 
restabilized his regime and forged Libya's best relationships abroad since his 
growing support of international terrorism first rendered the North African 
nation an international renegade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$300-Million Extravaganza 
</P>
<P>
In a $300-million extravaganza this month hosting 17 heads of state from much 
of the Arab world and black Africa, mid-level delegations from dozens of other 
countries and more than 700 foreign journalists, Kadafi has worked hard to show 
off both the successes of his tenure and his new-found amiability -- while 
still pledging to export his odd brand of Islamic socialism around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews last week, diplomats and business people say there are signs that 
Kadafi has moved to distance himself from radical Palestinian terrorist groups 
and the Irish Republican Army, reportedly refusing an audience recently with 
two Damascus-based Palestinian guerrilla leaders and signaling up to 70 
terrorist organizations and national liberation movements around the world that 
Libyan financial aid may no longer be so readily forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Western officials, used to the mercurial leader's swings of will and whim, say 
the new overtures are a practical move, aimed at winning back U.S. technology 
for Libya's aging oil fields and potential markets for Libyan agricultural 
exports, should they materialize as hoped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has a Practical Side 
</P>
<P>
But Kadafi the impatient revolutionary has always had a practical side. In 20 
years, his pariah regime has transformed Libya from a land of devastating 
poverty to a country with the second-highest per capita income in Africa, a 
nearly 90% literacy rate -- and, for a desert-bound nation of just 4.3 million 
people, an astonishing presence in the global consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps some people may think that such a revolution that may change the way 
of living all over the world could not come from such a small nation as the 
Libyan people," Ibrahim abu Kzam, deputy secretary general of Libya's People's 
Congress, said late last month. "The most important and significant changes in 
history were done by people who were not expected to be important people." 
</P>
<P>
When Kadafi and his military colleagues seized power in a coup on Sept. 1, 
1969, while King Idris was away in Turkey seeking medical treatment, Libya was 
already riding the upward crest of the oil wave, but only a very few of the 
rich were realizing the profits. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Kadafi has or has not done in the years since, analysts agree that his 
revolution has succeeded in redistributing the country's wealth to a 
significant degree, ensuring that most Libyans -- unlike many of their Arab 
neighbors -- own their own homes and cars and have access to decent medical 
care, schools and telephones. 
</P>
<P>
Before the revolution, all of Libya contained only 300,000 units of livable 
housing for the country's 365,000 families, and much of the countryside was 
peppered with tin shacks. Government leaders say the last hut was burned down 
in a celebration in 1976, and while some substandard houses remain in rural 
Libya, Tripoli has been rebuilt with modern high-rise apartments and hotels, 
most of which are owned by their tenants, either outright or on 
government-subsidized loans. 
</P>
<P>
Asphalt roads now stretch into the remotest regions of the southern desert. 
Sand airstrips have been replaced with three international airports at Tripoli, 
Baninah and Sabha. 
</P>
<P>
Jana, the official news agency, said the regime has increased total hospital 
beds from 7,589 to 19,661, established fundamental education for nearly every 
child born after the revolution and reclaimed 267 million acres of land to 
agricultural use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Was Nothing Before' 
</P>
<P>
"Libya was nothing before Kadafi," said 26-year-old Mohammed Salem Rheibi, a 
mechanical engineer who has a 1988 Mazda and lives with his family in a 
six-bedroom, three-story house in Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
The satisfaction is not universal, however. Despite Kadafi's show last year of 
demolishing prisons and freeing political prisoners, outside opposition groups 
estimate there are still 200 dissidents behind bars -- victims of Kadafi's 
hated but now much less powerful Revolutionary Guards -- and no immediate 
prospects for their release. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Libya is only now beginning to come out of a devastating economic 
downturn occasioned by Kadafi's enormous war expenditures, a decline in oil 
revenues and the regime's long discouragement of private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
In the Green Book that serves as the political Koran of the Libyan regime -- 
full of Kadafi's pronouncements on Islam, popular socialism, life and Arab 
unity that are intended to provide a road map for attainment of a true Libyan 
jamahiriya, or "state of the masses," Kadafi had proclaimed that profit making 
was one of the ills of capitalism that must be wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Businessmen Arrested 
</P>
<P>
All over Libya, shops closed. Business people suspected of hoarding profits 
were arrested. Lines began forming at grocery stores for even basic supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last year, in one of the first moves of his "green perestroika," Kadafi 
declared that profit making wasn't necessarily evil if it was intended to 
benefit the revolution. Thus was launched a major privatization program in the 
retail and small-service sector that has led to new shops, restaurants, 
vegetable stands, shoe stores and clothing outlets all over the capital. 
</P>
<P>
In the old souk, or marketplace, behind Tripoli's Revolution Square, 
storefronts and market stalls that a year ago were closed and shuttered are 
open again, repainted in the mint green that is the color of Kadafi's 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bedouins Wander Streets 
</P>
<P>
Strolling up the hot, rank, dusty alleyways are blank-faced Bedouins, the lines 
in their faces caked with desert silt, women in white scarfs impatiently 
pushing children ahead and teeming dozens of young men making their way 
aimlessly from stall to stall, pausing to stare at silver lame shoes and blow 
dryers. 
</P>
<P>
Since Kadafi declared that Libyans should not have to perform menial labor, 
Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians -- depending on Libya's mercurial 
international relations at any one time -- have been imported to wait on 
tables, clean hotel rooms and drive cabs. Foreign labor also performs most of 
the skilled duties required at factories and in the oil fields, Western 
diplomats say, because Libya remains drastically short of skilled labor despite 
all the new universities. 
</P>
<P>
Spending a week in Libya, a country that is governed by an estimated 700 
revolutionary "people's committees" that are intended to embody real democracy 
at work, one has the sense that it is a nation run by committee. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a foreign diplomats' tour of a major new public works site was 
abruptly canceled "for the moment" -- apparently because no one could agree on 
how or when it should be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Tripoli last week, during what would normally be working hours, 
dozens of young men could be seen in hotel lobbies, restaurants and cafes 
clustered around television sets, silently staring at rerun after rerun of the 
week's revolutionary parades and speeches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Libyans Do Not Work' 
</P>
<P>
"The Libyans do not work," explained one Western diplomat. "It's a society 
that's based on sitting in front of your shop and looking into the air. Their 
officials drink tea and sign papers, but they have no engineers, no scientists, 
no technicians." 
</P>
<P>
That is true, said another diplomat who has been based in Tripoli for several 
years, because many Libyans have never had to work, and they are both the 
beneficiaries and the victims of that state of affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Libyans are the most apathetic people that I have ever met. They take the 
same approach to political events as we do to meteorological phenomena," he 
said. "Even when they come to the point where the government says, 'Close your 
shop,' they don't say, 'That is enough.' They say, 'Well, maybe I can find a 
way to sell my goods elsewhere.' 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, their lives have changed too fast. In 1956, they were among 
the poorest countries in Africa, and that means in the world. Now, they have a 
nominal per capita income higher than most countries of Europe . . . and all 
this without them really having to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
It was the vast pools of petroleum beneath the Libyan desert that made all the 
difference. At their peak in the early '80s, Libyan oil wells were bringing in 
$20 billion a year. Then, with the worldwide drop in oil prices and the U.S. 
embargo, revenues slipped to a low in 1986 of $4.7 billion. This year, they are 
expected to ease back up to $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that Kadafi's new conciliatory mood may indeed be pragmatic. 
Western economic analysts say Libya badly needs new American equipment and 
technology in its oil fields, and it also needs to build economic solidarity 
with its Maghreb neighbors in North Africa if it hopes to develop new 
industries that will outlive the oil bonanza in the decades to come. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Libya expects to complete the first phase of a massive engineering 
project dubbed "The Great Man-Made River" that Libyans hope could be one key to 
developing a new, exportable agricultural industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mammoth Water Project 
</P>
<P>
Reversing the route of traditional water projects, the Great Man-Made River 
will import water from desert aquifers to the coast -- via a $25-billion, 
2,000-kilometer network of enormous concrete pipes carrying 5.68 million cubic 
meters of water a day. 
</P>
<P>
Libya is putting the finishing touches on a $6-billion steel complex at 
Misurata, which will be one of the largest industrial sites in the region and 
one of the four or five largest steel mills in the world, with an ultimate 
annual capacity of 1.32 million tons of liquid steel, one analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Galvanized 
</P>
<P>
If the American government hoped that the 1986 bombing raid would destabilize 
Kadafi's regime, it hoped wrong. If anything, the image of Kadafi's shattered 
home, preserved within the walls of a military compound in Tripoli, has helped 
to galvanize support for the man Libyans call simply "The Leader" and his 
tireless fury at the West. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more significantly, many of Libya's most influential citizens have 
become comfortable even with the discomforts of a nation run by a white-robed 
desert visionary. 
</P>
<P>
"Some young people here are frustrated," said one successful businessman. "They 
see American movies and Egyptian movies, and they say, 'Why are there no discos 
here? Why can't I drink?' You know, I studied in London when I was young -- it 
was 1968, the time of hippies and miniskirts -- and I had seen all that on TV 
in Libya, and I said, 'I want that.' Then, when I got there, I had money only 
to go to the movies once a week. My girlfriend and I would say, 'Oh, if we 
could go to the movies Tuesday night, and Wednesday night, and Thursday night.' 
But we could not. 
</P>
<P>
"Now," he said, "I have a three-bedroom house, a wife. I have money to go to 
the movies -- but here there are no movies. You see? It all passes. It is just 
the face of our lives."

FAST GROWTH: NEW TROUBLE IN STEEL TOWN 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BETHLEHEM, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Environmental change -- from polluted streams to congested highways and 
overdeveloped land -- is affecting the quality of life across the nation. Such 
change is gradual and often goes unnoticed while it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 To measure how various areas have been affected over the decades, The Times 
dispatched reporters to the places they grew up. This occasional series of 
articles examines how our hometown environments have been altered -- for better 
or for worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year at Christmastime, a star 81 feet high shines from its perch high on 
South Mountain, the southern anchor of this steel town founded by German 
immigrants on Christmas Eve nearly 250 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For tourists, the star symbolizes the religious Bethlehem, the nation's 
self-proclaimed Christmas City. But wooded South Mountain, rising from gritty 
neighborhoods near the rusty steel plant, has come to represent a less renowned 
Bethlehem -- the one that survived a brush with economic ruin and now is 
grappling with the consequences of its recovery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Freeway Access 
</P>
<P>
This fall, as the area marks five years of economic good times since the steel 
industry's near-collapse, a four-lane freeway that slices south of the city is 
to open. For the first time, South Mountain and its quiet foothills will be 
exposed to development. 
</P>
<P>
Builders are clearing patches of the mountainside and nearby flatlands for 
houses and condominiums as they rush to cash in on an anticipated surge in 
commuters to neighboring New Jersey and New York City. One proposal calls for 
felling 500 trees to make way for luxury houses. Another ambitious plan 
envisions a suburban mini-city that would cover 1,700 acres and employ 25,000 
people over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental fallout of rapid growth -- well known in Southern California 
-- is new and troubling to residents of Bethlehem and the surrounding Lehigh 
Valley. For decades, environmental problems here meant having to rewash laundry 
soiled on the clothesline by dust from blast furnaces, or avoiding the Lehigh 
River because of waste water from the mills. 
</P>
<P>
For many residents, pollution was never a serious concern. Indeed, it was 
customary to look the other way, since the primary source of dirty air and 
water was also the primary source of employment.

"When I was a kid, my mother took her clothes (from the clothesline) three 
times a day and washed them because of the dust -- red dust . . ." said E. 
(Chico) Curzi, a 57-year-old union leader who followed his father, uncles and 
grandfather to work in the Bethlehem Steel mills. "But she didn't complain, 
because her husband worked. It provided food on the table for her children." 
</P>
<P>
Today, bulldozers and cement trucks have displaced smokestacks and discharge 
pipes as the tools of environmental damage -- and residents are taking notice. 
With the federal government on its heels, Bethlehem Steel has spent more than 
$100 million on pollution-control equipment over the last 30 years. Scrubbers, 
massive cooling towers and bag houses -- the equivalent of huge vacuum cleaners 
-- have made air pollution from the steel plant a "non-issue," in the words of 
one local environmentalist. 
</P>
<P>
Attention has turned to the building frenzy that extends far beyond South 
Mountain and the path of the new freeway, in the works for 20 years as an 
alternative to the antiquated and hazardous Lehigh Valley Thruway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lessons of Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that we would learn from L.A.'s mistakes," said Alfred Siess Jr., 
a former Bethlehem Steel engineer once assigned to the company's Torrance 
office, who fought to block the new I-78 highway. "Freeways proliferate 
development. They are a losing proposition for those of us who want to stay 
here because of (the area's) rural character, clean air and clean water." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter to a local newspaper, Elizabeth Winters, who lives in a 
small town south of the mountain, wrote: "Who wants to see the bare or 
developed hillsides of California here? Hasn't tearing up the landscape for 
I-78 been enough?" 
</P>
<P>
Local experts attribute the boom in part to a realignment of the region's 
economy away from smokestack industries such as Bethlehem Steel and Mack Trucks 
in nearby Allentown. The steel company, for example, employed 20,000 people at 
the start of this decade but now provides only about 5,300 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
New employment has emerged in light manufacturing, data processing, insurance 
and medical services as industrial parks and suburban offices have become the 
"clean factories" of the 1980s and 1990s. Taken as a single entity, Lehigh 
Valley Industrial Park Inc., a nonprofit group that operates four industrial 
parks, would be the region's largest employer, with 210 businesses providing 
9,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Employment Rate 
</P>
<P>
"In 1983, the pot just started to get warm, and the high burner has been on 
ever since," said Grover H. Stainbrook Jr., the company's executive vice 
president. "Five years ago, we had unemployment of 13%. We now have 3.9%." 
</P>
<P>
Stainbrook and others attribute much of the growth -- both commercial and 
residential -- to a steady migration of businesses and residents out of New 
Jersey, which lies across the Delaware River about 10 miles from downtown 
Bethlehem. Local real estate agents say the newcomers -- some of whom drive 100 
miles to work in New York City -- are attracted by relatively affordable 
housing, lower taxes, good schools and a low crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
"They pop on the bus at 5 in the morning and come back home at 7 in the 
evening," said Kenard O. Natter, a Bethlehem real estate agent who has sold 
houses to Wall Street stockbrokers, bank executives and corporate officials. 
"Our buses have gotten very sophisticated. They are nicer than most of the 
aircraft. You get on there and read your paper, and by (the) time you are 
finished . . . you are in New York City." 
</P>
<P>
One local government study estimated that 20% of property transactions in the 
eastern half of the Lehigh Valley involved buyers moving from New Jersey. A 
private survey conducted by Bethlehem economist Kamran Afshar concluded that 
37% of new homeowners in the region were from outside the area. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we drove here, we basically fell in love with it," said John 
Francis, a helicopter pilot who moved to Bethlehem from Princeton, N.J., and 
for two years commuted more than 90 minutes to work in New York City before 
taking a local job. 
</P>
<P>
"I had this preconceived idea of a 1930s steel town, but it wasn't anything 
like that," he said. "It was well taken care of, orderly and clean. And it was 
a much better deal for your money. Taxes are cheaper and automobile insurance 
is about half of what you pay in New Jersey." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to immigrants such as Francis and his family, population in the Lehigh 
Valley has grown almost 4% since 1980. It is a two-county region of about 
500,000 people that includes the cities of Bethlehem, Allentown and Easton as 
well as several dozen townships and boroughs. Overall population in 
Pennsylvania, meanwhile, has risen just 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taking Toll on Environment 
</P>
<P>
The area's new popularity, while providing jobs and economic vitality, has 
taken its toll on the environment: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Deforestation on South Mountain has led to calls for limits on tree 
removal, and some residents are beginning to worry about environmental damage 
from new and proposed access roads on the south slope and nearby flatlands. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Development has pushed some local roads to their limit and brought traffic 
problems to previously uncongested areas. Developers are being asked to pay for 
traffic studies, and some local governments are considering charging them for 
road improvements. In a recent public opinion survey, respondents listed 
worsening traffic congestion as the No. 1 drawback of economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bethlehem has refused to extend water mains to new housing in its 
fastest-growing suburb because the city's system is so overextended that it 
cannot deliver enough water during hours of peak demand. A college that hoped 
to build a dormitory was told it must provide its own water or wait until a new 
municipal water tank can be constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dwindling landfill space and soaring trash-disposal costs led several years 
ago to establishment of a local waste authority, which sought to build a 
$180-million incinerator. The proposal, opposed by environmental groups because 
of pollution concerns, collapsed early this year, leaving each city to deal 
with its own trash crisis. Bethlehem has a landfill it recently expanded, but 
Allentown must haul its garbage hundreds of miles out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four of the 13 public sewage systems in the Lehigh Valley have average 
daily flows that exceed design capacity, and three others are approaching their 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Concerned about water shortages, the Delaware River Basin Commission has 
proposed that low-flush toilets be required in all new buildings and renovation 
projects, beginning in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We are benefiting economically from the tremendous influx of people from New 
Jersey and New York, but it is also a challenge to provide the infrastructure 
for them," Bethlehem Mayor Kenneth Smith said. "Probably the greatest challenge 
in government today is to continue to grow economically yet preserve the 
quality of life, the green space and the quality of our water and air." 
</P>
<P>
If the development trend continues, most of rural Lehigh Valley will be urban 
or suburban by 2011, a recent government study predicted. Between 1982 and 
1986, about 6,800 acres of vacant or agricultural land was developed, 
two-thirds of it for housing. In 1987, 2,625 housing units were built and 4,103 
lots were approved for subdivision, a record high. 
</P>
<P>
The demand has pushed land prices so high that about half a dozen rural 
townships have established "security areas" to protect farms from the 
residential invasion. At the county level, farmers get a tax break if they 
agree not to develop their land. Statewide, voters recently approved a 
$100-million bond issue to purchase development rights from farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere you go, you'll see a flag or a stake in the field," said Roslyn 
Kahler, who farms about 400 acres with his two sons and also heads the 
Northampton County Conservation Service, which reviews subdivisions for erosion 
control. "In the past few years, farm values north of Bethlehem have gone from 
$2,000 an acre up to $10,000 and $15,000 an acre. . . . When the time is ripe, 
it is being sold." 
</P>
<P>
A public opinion survey conducted last year by the Joint Planning Commission, a 
regional agency for the Lehigh Valley, found widespread concern about 
disappearing farmland. Agricultural land being developed should be kept as 
farms, 72% of the respondents said. About half of those people said the most 
important reason for preserving the land was to retain open space. 
</P>
<P>
In outlying parts of the Lehigh Valley, where the suburbs meet the country, 
farmers and their neighbors in new housing tracts have at times found 
coexistence difficult. Urban escapees seeking the peaceful life complain about 
manure odors, flies, dead animals and wild plants that aggravate their 
allergies. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, meanwhile, become enraged when teen-agers use their fields as race 
tracks for all-terrain vehicles and dirt bikes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newcomers' Complaints 
</P>
<P>
"These Jersey people come in here and they try to tell the people who have 
lived here for a long time what to do," said Kahler, the farmer and 
conservationist. "They want open space, but they don't want you to spray (for 
pests). They don't want you to spread manure. You know, it smells. . . . Hey, 
if you want to live out here, put up with it!" 
</P>
<P>
Farmers have also had run-ins with local government. School officials in a 
rural township southwest of Bethlehem, anticipating rising enrollment, want to 
build a high school on a 108-acre farm, but the family doesn't want to sell the 
property. The district has condemned the farm and now is fighting for the land 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Schools 
</P>
<P>
"Our community is preparing schools for people who don't even live here," said 
Ollie Orth, president and founder of the Lehigh-South Mountain Woodlands Assn. 
and a slow-growth candidate for county commissioner. "It is a self-fulfilling 
prophecy. If you provide more school capacity than you need right now, you will 
fill it by attracting people, especially from New Jersey." 
</P>
<P>
Even within the city limits of Bethlehem, small family farms that survived past 
building booms are being devoured by residential neighborhoods. A horse farm on 
Butztown Road on the north side of town has been replaced by luxury 
condominiums. Less than a mile away, a cornfield hidden behind a convenience 
store and gas station has met the same fate. 
</P>
<P>
The alarming loss of farmland inspired one group of determined historians and 
environmentalists to rally the community to save six acres of one of 
Bethlehem's earliest farms as a memorial to the city's agrarian past. Lehigh 
County purchased the farm and turned it over to a nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historic Plantation Saved 
</P>
<P>
The Burnside Plantation, now sandwiched between a rusty paint mill and a 
21-story office tower, was the Colonial homestead of James Burnside, who was 
elected the area's first legislator in 1752. It once spanned 500 acres and was 
tilled by Bethlehem's original religious settlers. The original stone 
farmhouse, built in 1748, is still standing, and the preservationists plan to 
move a 150-year-old barn nearby. The barn was donated by AT&amp;T, which 
disassembled it to make way for a 450,000-square-foot research facility west of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids nowadays don't know where chickens come from," said Gertrude Fox, a 
73-year-old environmental activist who three years ago came up with the idea of 
saving the plantation. "They think they come from the freezer. So we will have 
teaching facilities here. This will be our last chance. It will be the last 
farm left in the three cities." 
</P>
<P>
There have been other environmental success stories here. Residents near 
Monocacy Creek, in north Bethlehem, have monitored development to protect the 
stream from runoff. Their efforts paid off when the state fish commission 
designated it as a trophy trout stream. Several Lehigh Valley communities are 
moving forward with curb-side trash-recycling programs in response to a state 
recycling law that goes into effect in two years. And, last year, the Delaware 
and Lehigh canals were designated a National Heritage Corridor so that they 
will be preserved for recreational use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valley Has Awakened 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the face and character of Bethlehem and its neighbors are changing 
swiftly, and longtime residents recognize that the once-sleepy Lehigh Valley, 
for better or worse, has awakened for good. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't hardly find a place any more that isn't built up," said Ethel 
Hunsicker, who has worked for 36 years at Yeager's Pharmacy on Main Street in 
Hellertown, a tiny suburb of Bethlehem where the new freeway is expected to 
dump much of its traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it just isn't as friendly any more, but I don't think I would ever 
want to move out. I don't think I could get used to another place."

CUT THE LEGALESE, SAY IT STRAIGHT IN PLAIN ENGLISH, BAR TELLS LAWYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1596, an English chancellor decided he had had it with lawyers' wordiness. 
</P>
<P>
Gazing at a document filed in his court, the chancellor ordered a hole cut 
through the center of the thing, all 120 pages of it. 
</P>
<P>
Next, he directed that the lawyer who wrote it have his head stuffed through 
the hole. The offender was then led around, to be exhibited to all those 
attending court. 
</P>
<P>
Four centuries later, the State Bar of California is trying a different 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
Led by a San Diego attorney, the Bar's Board of Governors recently passed a 
resolution urging its 117,000 members to "promote and foster" the use of plain 
English. The resolution was prompted by a 1987 Bar survey in which 90% of the 
public and 91% of the lawyers responding said there was a need for simpler 
legal documents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guidelines Ordered 
</P>
<P>
The board voted to urge lawyers to simplify forms and language used in the 
practice of law. It also directed the Bar staff to develop "simple-language 
guidelines" for communicating with the public and for helping lawyers 
communicate with clients. 
</P>
<P>
"What I've discovered since we passed the thing is that there's a ton of 
interest," said San Diego lawyer John Seitman, a member of the Bar board who 
led the drive to pass the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"That tells me there's a problem we're addressing," Seitman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented Interest 
</P>
<P>
The Bar's action -- the governors took a first step by dropping the word hereby 
from the resolution -- comes as lawyers across the nation are demonstrating an 
unprecedented interest in learning to write clearly and concisely. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers are being turned away at the doors of special writing workshops and 
lectures. Legal journals regularly offer articles sharing writing tips. Books 
on the topic abound. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the topic is hot," said Steven Stark, who teaches writing at Harvard 
Law School. "If you go into any legal bookstore, there's a dozen books on the 
thing. 'Better Writing in 30 Days,' that sort of idea." 
</P>
<P>
Stark teaches occasional courses through the Practicing Law Institute in 
Manhattan, a leading continuing-education clearinghouse for lawyers. At a 
seminar last month in New York, the room held 60 people. "We filled it up with 
60 and we had to turn people away," said Eileen Shapiro, an institute staff 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Joel F. Henning is a Chicago lawyer whose firm, Hildebrandt Inc., offers 
writing courses to lawyers at private firms and at government offices. 
"Business in the legal-writing field is booming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The seminars put on by Henning's firm run for three or six weeks at $2,500 per 
session, so a six-week seminar costs $15,000. Among Henning's clients are the 
Bank of America's legal departments in Los Angeles and San Francisco, IBM's 
legal department and the Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that the seminars and the books try to get across is that lawyers 
should write in a simple and straightforward manner. 
</P>
<P>
After all, not even a lawyer says at dinner-table conversation:"Please pass the 
green beans. Said green beans are excellent." But many lawyers feel compelled 
to write their briefs with extra words they think lend precision, said Richard 
C. Wydick, a law professor at UC Davis. Wydick's book, "Plain English for 
Lawyers," includes that example and the story of the hapless English lawyer of 
four centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
That hoped-for precision, however, is usually illusory, said David Mellinkoff, 
professor emeritus at UCLA Law School and the dean of legal-writing 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask most lawyers or judges why they write the way they do, they'll tell 
you it's because ordinary English is imprecise," Mellinkoff said. " 'If you 
write it . . . according to the language of the law, it might not look pretty, 
but it is precise and will be understood by lawyers and judges years from now 
and so forth.' Most of that is hogwash." 
</P>
<P>
A "small core" of legal terms -- such as hearsay or plaintiff -- assuredly have 
their place because they are precise, Mellinkoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"But most of the language of the law is not precise and most of the language of 
the law does not have to be repeated and repeated and repeated in order to make 
legal documents and legal writing precise and clear," Mellinkoff said. 
</P>
<P>
The trend toward the use of "plain English" in lawyers' private practice is 
about 10 years behind the movement toward simple language in other areas of the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
The broader movement itself perhaps can be traced back to 1963, when Mellinkoff 
published his first book on the subject, "The Language of the Law." 
</P>
<P>
Previously, there had been occasional attention paid to the topic -- in 1939, 
for instance, a Yale law professor put out a book called "Woe Unto You, 
Lawyers!" complaining of lawyers' "dreary double-talk" -- but Mellinkoff 
contends that his book "gave courage to lawyers who wanted to make a change." 
</P>
<P>
Wydick published his work in 1978. It since has "outsold any law book ever 
published in the United States," more than 230,000 copies, said Keith Sipe, 
president of the Carolina Academic Press, the Durham, N.C., publisher. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time Wydick's book hit print, many federal regulations, at 
then-President Jimmy Carter's urging, were simplified. And many states adopted 
laws requiring clarity in consumer documents. 
</P>
<P>
California did not go that far. The Legislature did, however, pass a law 
ordering state agencies producing regulations to write those after Jan. 1, 
1983, in "plain, straightforward language." 
</P>
<P>
Many law schools also began offering legal-writing courses. Most "good law 
schools" now offer a course "designed to teach, among other things, the plain 
English style," Wydick said. 
</P>
<P>
But seeing practical results is a long process, Mellinkoff said. And there's a 
vicious cycle at work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, school administrators don't accord writing courses the importance 
given to core courses, Mellinkoff said. Younger instructors, instead of a 
tenured professor, often teach the course, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the materials that students must read in those core courses, 
primarily old appellate cases, riddled with legalisms, Mellinkoff said. 
</P>
<P>
After reading all those cases, students during exams "don't get graded for bad 
writing," said Tom Goldstein, a lawyer and the dean of the graduate journalism 
school at UC Berkeley. They "get graded for thinking. There's no incentive." 
</P>
<P>
Simplicity is "the message that has to be gotten across," Goldstein said. "So 
the State Bar saying this, fine. They should say it, they should repeat it." 
But real change will only come from the schools and firms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That change is inevitable, said Robert Benson, a professor at Loyola Law School 
in Los Angeles. But he conceded that he is an optimist. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Benson surveyed appellate judges in Los Angeles, as well as their 
clerks, showing them briefs written in plain English and in "gobbledygook." 
</P>
<P>
The judges and clerks far preferred the simpler briefs, Benson said, saying it 
was much more persuasive and "must have been written by lawyers from 
prestigious law firms. On the other hand, the gobbledygook must have been 
written by lawyers with low prestige. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what's going to get them," Benson said. "These people don't want to be 
thought of as shlocky. And that's what legalese is: shlocky."

WILSON FIRES UP GOP FAITHFUL BUT ALL IS NOT PEACEFUL IN STATE PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE and JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two sides to the California Republican Party at this juncture and 
both were evident Saturday at its semi-annual convention in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The pragmatic side is represented by U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who is now a 
candidate for governor in 1990. His crowd-pleasing speech left GOP mouths 
watering for winning not just the governorship but also for taking control of 
the Legislature and sending 12 new GOP congressmen to Washington before the 
turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson delighted the activists with his prediction that the initiative process 
will, in 1990, reform the heavily politicized drawing of legislative and 
congressional districts. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans believe that more of their number would be elected to the 
Legislature and Congress if the districts were drawn to reflect their 
increasing share of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
If he is to tackle California's problems as its next governor, Wilson told the 
partisans here, "I intend to have the help in Sacramento that Gov. (George) 
Deukmejian deserves but does not have." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he is likely to support not just one, but several competing ballot 
measures to strip the Democratic-controlled Legislature of its current power to 
draw district lines. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson listed his accomplishments as legislator, San Diego mayor and U.S. 
senator going back two decades and predicted that the Democrats will not be 
able to nominate a gubernatorial candidate next year who can match his record. 
</P>
<P>
The other side of the state GOP is inward looking and ideological. Here, in the 
Hilton Hotel foyers and suites, party activists bickered and argued and called 
for purges. 
</P>
<P>
One group of activists, led by Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), 
demanded that homosexuals be purged from the party. This is part of what has 
now become a years-long and almost wholely unsuccessful crusade by the 
conservative congressman against anything having to do with gays. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest crowds of the weekend, outside of the formal mealtime 
speeches, gathered to hear Dannemeyer in a finger-pointing, full-decibel 
hallway debate with interloper Gloria Allred, the liberal activist, who 
surfaced at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll put my hand down if you'll put your's down," Dannemeyer said as fingers 
went wagging. "You put your's down first," Allred snapped. And so it went. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dramatic Blowups 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Angela (Bay) Buchanan, a candidate for state treasurer, dramatically 
produced blowups of notarized documents showing that incumbent Treasurer Thomas 
W. Hayes, also a Republican, had throughout most of his life registered to vote 
as a nonpartisan. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan bills herself as "the real Republican," but the use of the documents 
left onlookers puzzled because Hayes has the backing of GOP Gov. Deukmejian, 
who appointed him and who apparently was satisfied when Hayes registered as a 
Republican upon his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Puzzled about another matter here were state GOP leaders, who admitted that 
they could not explain why the party still has no credible candidates for state 
controller and secretary of state, two of seven statewide constitutional 
offices at stake next year. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, said former state party Chairman Robert W. Naylor, "you'd 
think we would have somebody operating on the 'bus theory.' You know, the 
incumbent Democrat may get hit by a bus." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wilson Disappointed 
</P>
<P>
Wilson expressed his disappointment at his failure so far to recruit candidates 
to take on Democratic incumbents in the two offices. But he said he will 
continue to seek Republicans to take a dare. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not an easy decision. It can change your life. I know," said Wilson.

MINOR CLASHES MARK FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY'S FIRST GAY-PRIDE EVENT IS MARRED 
</P>

<P>
Gay rights advocates and fundamentalist Christians shoved and taunted each 
other Saturday at Orange County's first gay-pride festival, where small clashes 
erupted. 
</P>
<P>
But organizers, who had battled for months to see the festival realized, 
declared it a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this is Orange County," exclaimed Marcy Aguirre, a lesbian 
attending the festival. "It looks like we finally made it here. This is so 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of uniformed police and mounted officers patroled the festival grounds 
at Centennial Regional Park in Santa Ana, where someone had sprinkled tacks in 
the parking lots to puncture tires. But despite the shouting and shoving, no 
violence occurred and no one was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the park's chain-link fence, the festival itself was a peaceful scene of 
strolling couples, barbecues, bright balloons and musicians. Police estimated 
that about 1,000 people had arrived by mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Nolan, a gay county supervisor from San Mateo, said both gay activists and 
opponents of gay rights throughout the state are watching Orange County as the 
festival continues today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle that this is happening in Orange County," Nolan said. "When 
people think of Orange County, they think of anti-gay conservatives. This is 
going to give other smaller communities the strength to carry on and have their 
own festivals." 
</P>
<P>
Janet Avery, president of Orange County Cultural Pride, the festival's 
organizer, said: "I'm exhilarated. It's here and it's happening. Nobody can 
ever take this day away from us." 
</P>
<P>
John J. Duran, an attorney for Orange County Cultural Pride, said the 
festival's success was a victory for gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be on pins and needles until this is over," Duran said. "But 
right now, we're the victors. We've been the winners in this battle since the 
gates opened this morning and the festival came alive." 
</P>
<P>
But the clashes also began soon after the gates opened. Outside the 87-acre 
park, picketers circled the sidewalks of Edinger Avenue and Fairview Street, 
waving signs and shouting at arriving cars. One sign read, "Sodomy, Drugs, AIDS 
And Abortion All End In Death." 
</P>
<P>
The continued magnet for the controversy was the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, head of 
the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition and the leader for the last 
several months of the unsuccessful effort to prevent the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon and his supporters have filed recall notices against six of the seven 
Santa Ana City Council members who refused to sign a "pro-family" resolution, 
drafted by Sheldon, that would have banned the festival from the park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade Epithets 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon's plan for a noon press conference at a park entrance instead became a 
verbal battle between the two sides. Fundamentalists shouted, "sinners!" and 
"sodomites!" and gay activists countered with, "you bigots! and liars!" 
</P>
<P>
Instead of holding a press conference, Sheldon spoke with individual reporters. 
The tense atmosphere led to occasional pushing matches as gays sought access to 
Sheldon's mini-press conferences. 
</P>
<P>
"They're violating our civil rights," Sheldon said of the gay protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to win or lose," Sheldon said. "We just want to show these 
people their sins and lead them down the right path."

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
None of the diners even looked up from their rigatoni and blackened thresher 
shark when the first choppers rumbled over the Columbus Street Restaurant and 
Bar. On their second pass, Philip Genz stopped on the sidewalk outside and 
looked up. 
</P>
<P>
"Hope it works better this time," said Genz with an ironic little smile. Then 
he continued his casual Friday night stroll toward a nearby gelato emporium, 
scarcely acknowledging the droplets of malathion-laced corn syrup falling 
around him. 
</P>
<P>
If this were a Hollywood movie, some blurb writer might put it this way: 
"Theyyyy're baaaack!" They are Medflies, the treacherous little bugs that 
turned up again last week in the same area where a tumultuous episode in the 
history of California politics and agriculture broke out in 1980 and raged for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
The flies were finally wiped out that time, but not before costing taxpayers 
$100 million and farmers another $100 million. Some residents had their yards 
sprayed from the air half a dozen times, and the uproar caused the political 
hopes of Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. to crash in a whir of rotor blades. 
</P>
<P>
When the helicopters returned to spray Mountain View again Friday night, Brown 
was in a tuxedo at the opening night of the San Francisco Opera -- where a 
protest by AIDS activists during the overture caused more controversy than the 
dousing of cars and gardens by malathion here, about 35 miles south. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Resistance 
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago the helicopters were greeted with gunshots and telephoned 
threats. Red Cross evacuation centers were set up, and there was public sobbing 
by residents afraid of what the chemical might do to their organic radishes and 
their dogs' lungs. San Jose officials denied use of the city's airport, forcing 
the choppers to fly from a Catholic cemetery kept dark for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday there was nothing of the sort. Only about 10 people showed up at 
a special meeting of the Mountain View City Council on Friday morning to 
discuss the spraying, and the council took no steps to stop the night's 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not as scared and fearful as when it first happened," council member Bob 
Schatz said. 
</P>
<P>
The council itself planned to be outside the spray area Friday night at a 
social meeting with the City Council of neighboring Los Altos. "I am going to 
move my other car out of the area too," said Councilman Art Takahara. 
</P>
<P>
By 9 p.m., when the two leased Huey helicopters rose from a corner of Moffett 
Field naval station and made their first pass over Mountain View, the only 
visible sign of concern was the plastic tarps thrown over cars to protect 
finishes from the gummy droplets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
North-South Pattern 
</P>
<P>
The choppers flew a north-south pattern over this city and parts of Los Altos 
and Sunnyvale, tailed at times by three choppers carrying news crews from Bay 
Area TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest upset from the spraying was probably at the Farm Fresh Produce 
stand on Grant Road. Federal agricultural agents Friday ordered that a season's 
worth of tomatoes be stripped off vines behind the stand and that any not sold 
this weekend be destroyed. Owners Dave and Diane Schmitz said they would take 
"an incredible loss," and customers jammed the stand Friday evening buying up 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years before, the find of Mediterranean fruit flies in a San Jose tree 
turned into a running debacle for Gov. Brown. It was the first outbreak ever in 
California, and for a year Brown heeded the advice of environmentalists and a 
few scientists and withheld permission for aerial malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
It was a risky gamble. Medflies -- the most potentially damaging of all fruit 
flies -- could ravage the state's fruit and vegetable industry if the few flies 
that were found took hold. In 1980 and '81 they kept spreading, despite ground 
spraying and the release of sterilized flies imported from Peru and elsewhere. 
State officials said some of the supposedly sterile flies had come through the 
radiation treatment with their reproductive abilities intact. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was finally forced to allow aerial spraying in July, 1981, after federal 
officials threatened a quarantine of all California crops. The Medflies had 
made an ominous move out of the San Jose area toward the farms of the San 
Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Before it was over, aerial malathion spraying had to be extended into eight Bay 
Area counties, covering about 2 million homes. Roadblocks set up to guard 
against infested fruit being moved into the San Joaquin Valley stopped about 5 
million cars and trucks. Brown's support plummeted, and polls found that he was 
seen as a bumbler for his handling of the Medfly crisis. He was trounced by 
Pete Wilson when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
This time, state officials suggested, the lack of controversy is due to the 
more precise tactics used to quash infestations. Aerial spraying will only be 
needed once as part of a multipronged attack on the flies, thus people don't 
object as much, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The helicopters fly low and they're noisy," said Gera Curry, spokeswoman for 
the state Department of Food and Agriculture. "The fact that people's sleep was 
disrupted week after week was a big factor. We could have been dropping water 
and people would have objected." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fruit Trees Sprayed 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday ground crews walked through the center of Mountain View where the 
live flies were found and sprayed fruit trees. Then, 10 days from now, the 
state will begin releasing 30 million to 40 million sterile Medflies a week 
until the colony dies out from lack of reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
This approach has been used successfully three times in Los Angeles since the 
1980-82 outbreak in Northern California, Curry said. A fourth eradication 
effort is being carried out in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the first devastating outbreak, the state has obtained a guaranteed 
source of sterile fruit flies through a lab it sponsors in Hawaii, where the 
Medflies are a recurring threat to agriculture.

Vice President Dan Quayle said Saturday that the United States supports the 
nationalist independence movements in the Soviet Union and suggested Washington 
may react if Moscow tries to block them. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's hope that the Baltic states continue in the direction they want to go . 
. . toward asserting their independence," Quayle said on Cable News Network's 
"Evans and Novak" program. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Washington would respond if the Soviet Union refused to grant 
independence to the Baltic republics of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, Quayle 
said it might. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, clearly every event triggers a response," he said. "And if there's a 
negative event toward the Baltic states, I would imagine there would be a 
negative response."

ACTIVISTS IN UKRAINE CALL FOR SECESSION, OUSTER OF PARTY BOSS

<P>
Speakers at a founding conference for the country's newest independent 
political movement, this one in the Ukraine, called Saturday for separating 
from the Soviet Union and for ousting the republic's longtime Communist Party 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a leading Kremlin conservative warned that this country's 
existence is threatened by its ethnic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, a statement reaching Moscow from Armenians living in the 
troubled enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh appealed for help from the United Nations 
to fend off attacks from Azerbaijanis and said that the Kremlin is unable to 
protect them despite the presence of 4,000 Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
These latest developments came amid growing signs that the conflicts among many 
of the more than 100 ethnic groups in the Soviet Union is perceived by 
officials here to have reached a crisis point during the last month, while 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was vacationing at the Black Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev ended his vacation Saturday night with a previously unannounced 
address on Soviet television, but he made direct reference only briefly to the 
nationalities problem, saying it will be dealt with at a Central Committee 
plenum soon. The long-awaited plenum is likely to be held sometime this month, 
according to both Soviet and Western sources. 
</P>
<P>
While Gorbachev was away from Moscow, the Central Committee released a tough 
statement last month calling for an end to "nationalist hysteria," and the 
Communist Party media began a campaign against mass movements that have called 
for independence from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kremlin's efforts to deal with the growing unrest have so far been 
limited to "just jawboning," a senior Western diplomat observed last week at a 
briefing with American journalists. 
</P>
<P>
What steps the Central Committee can take to cool ethnic hostility is very 
unclear. Western analysts have speculated that a shake-up is likely of some 
local Communist Party officials, who have been widely criticized for failing to 
rein in local nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call for Leader's Ouster 
</P>
<P>
In the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, members of the Ukrainian Popular Movement for 
Perestroika, meeting on the second of a three-day founding session, called for 
dismissing Ukrainian Communist Party chief Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky and 
bringing him to trial for his handling of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be no talk of perestroika (reform) in the Ukraine when the criminals 
responsible for Chernobyl are still in power," said Sergei Konyev, a member of 
the Soviet Parliament. He also called for an end to the "reign of political 
dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
Shcherbitsky, a Ukrainian party official since 1952, was a crony of former 
Communist Party boss Leonid I. Brezhnev and has been a full member of the 
Politburo since 1971. At 71, he is the oldest Politburo member and is 
considered among the most conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Also at Saturday's meeting, Levko Lukyanenko, a former political prisoner, 
called for Ukrainian independence. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole history is a history of occupation, but we have suffered most under 
the Russians," he said. "For this reason, the principal goal of our movement 
must be to leave the Soviet Union. International law and the Soviet 
constitution give us the right to independence." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, speaking in the Central Asian 
republic of Kirgizia, "warned of the possibility of the Soviet Union 
disintegrating over the nationalities issue," Radio Moscow reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev, considered the Politburo's leading conservative, said that 
strengthening party unity should be the country's top priority. He added that 
Communist members should not take part in "meetings with anti-socialist 
tendencies," a reference to the popular movements in the Baltic republics of 
Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, as well as the Ukraine and several other 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, word reached Moscow of an appeal published four days ago in a 
Nagorno-Karabakh newspaper, Sovetakan Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
The statement by a council of Armenians, who make up the majority in the 
Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, said that armed Azerbaijanis were massing in the 
region and were believed to be preparing for attacks on Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people have been killed in ethnic clashes in the area in the last 
18 months. Armenians are demanding autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh, which 
officially is part of Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
The bleakness of the situation in the area was underscored by a report Friday 
night on Soviet television that showed buses with bullet holes and broken 
windows. The buses had been traveling through Armenian populated areas of 
Nagorno-Karabakh when they were attacked by Azerbaijanis, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian statement, addressed to the United Nations, said that Moscow had 
failed to protect the Armenians and added, "We appeal to you to do everything 
possible for the security of the Armenian population of Karabakh, even 
including dispatching a contingent of U.N. soldiers, should this become 
necessary."

ARAB GUNMEN SLAY ACTING MAYOR IN WEST BANK TOWN

Masked Palestinians shot and killed the Israeli-appointed deputy mayor of a 
West Bank town Saturday evening because he had defied activists' orders to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
The masked assailants burst into the home of Deputy Mayor Yusuf Mohammed Milhem 
of Qalqiliya and shot him at least six times in the chest, Arab reports said. 
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman said Milhem, 46, was rushed to an Israeli hospital, where he 
died of his wounds. An Israeli army spokesman said police have begun an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Milhem and his house had been attacked several times by activists demanding 
that he resign. In January, 1989, while he was being treated at Qalqiliya 
Hospital, masked men entered his room and stabbed him. 
</P>
<P>
Milhem's superior, the mayor of Qalqiliya, moved to a nearby Israeli town after 
he was threatened for refusing to resign. The underground leadership of the 
Palestinian uprising has repeatedly called on Israeli-appointed officials to 
leave their posts. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, the army ordered all the people in the area into a nearby 
field for questioning, Palestinian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a knife-wielding Arab passenger stabbed the Israeli driver of a bus 
and tried to force the vehicle off the road at the same site where 16 people 
were killed in a similar attack last June. 
</P>
<P>
Other passengers grabbed the attacker and the bus remained on the road, 
according to news reports. 
</P>
<P>
In the occupied territories, Palestinians brought business and transportation 
to a standstill Saturday in a general strike to mark the beginning of the 22nd 
month of the uprising against Israeli occupation. The army said Nablus, the 
West Bank's largest town, was under curfew for the eighth consecutive day as 
troops and security agents searched for uprising activists. 
</P>
<P>
An off-duty Israeli police dog handler was burned badly when a Molotov cocktail 
was thrown at his car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Reuven Perlmutter, 28, who was driving alone, received burns over 25% of his 
body and was in serious but stable condition in an Israeli hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said four suspects had been detained.

JAMES FLANIGAN: IN AUTOS, IT'S SURVIVAL OF THE BIGGEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
News reports on the automobile business contain hints of things to come -- of 
which companies will survive the winnowing down to half a dozen global car 
makers, and which will not. 
</P>
<P>
The news is that Saab, the Swedish auto maker, is reaching out to Ford for an 
alliance that will help it stay in the game. And that the West German 
government approves of a merger that could strengthen Mercedes-Benz by making 
it part of a giant company. 
</P>
<P>
It may come as a surprise that even Mercedes, known around the world for its 
luxury cars, would have trouble making it unassisted in the competitive 1990s 
-- but that's the way it looks. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidation in the auto industry has long been predicted -- most notably by 
Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman of Italy's Fiat, who said in the 1970s that 
ultimately there would be only five global car producers. Yet for a long time 
that prediction has looked foolish as more brands flooded the market. Today, 
according to the industry consultants J. D. Power &amp; Associates, 16.5 
million cars, light trucks and vans -- in an incredible 350 different models -- 
are produced or imported to supply the U.S. market. But only 14.6 million are 
being purchased, leaving an oversupply of roughly 2 million vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Be Too Big 
</P>
<P>
That's a competitive environment in which even haughty Mercedes and once-aloof 
Honda must give discounts to sell cars. It's an environment in which some 
companies are losing money and a shakeout is inevitable, says analyst Charles 
Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co., an investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
What does that mean to you as a car buyer? It could mean "better cars at the 
same or lower prices," says Brady, because what lies ahead is not a merger 
frenzy with big firms gobbling small, but a sharing of production and design 
costs in an attempt to appeal to customers of every taste, pocketbook and 
country. 
</P>
<P>
What it means if you're an investor is that an automobile company can't be too 
big or too rich. 
</P>
<P>
Because the cost of developing new products is enormous. Ford spent roughly 
$3.5 billion to design and develop its Taurus line. But Ford can do that 
because it spreads development costs over worldwide sales of 3.3 million 
vehicles and uses that basic design not only for the 350,000 Tauruses that it 
makes each year but also for Probes and Thunderbirds and Escorts, and Mercurys 
and Lincolns, too. 
</P>
<P>
A producer such as Saab -- making only 116,000 cars a year -- has no similar 
opportunity to spread its costs and so can't afford $3 billion to develop a new 
car. Thus, it is seeking an alliance in which it can share some costs with the 
big U.S. company and yet go on producing its cars in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well-Known Names 
</P>
<P>
Ford already has several such alliances. It owns 25% of Japan's Mazda and 
produces cars with Mazda in Michigan; it has a joint venture with Volkswagen in 
Brazil. In Europe, where Ford manufactures in seven countries, Saab may fit 
into its plans for a global car in which design work can be done on one 
continent and applied to automobiles produced on many continents. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, such an operation demands a global network for production, sales and 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, too, a company without such a network will have higher costs and 
need help. 
</P>
<P>
Car makers seeking alliances will include some well-known names. BMW -- fewer 
than 500,000 cars a year -- will need a partner; Saab's Swedish neighbor Volvo, 
at roughly 300,000 cars, will need one, too. Such specialty producers as Jaguar 
and Porsche will need help. And Mercedes, which produces fewer than 600,000 
vehicles a year, will need help in cars -- notwithstanding whatever aid the big 
aerospace merger of Messerschmitt with its parent company Daimler-Benz can give 
the luxury auto producer. 
</P>
<P>
Heading up alliances will be the industry's giants: General Motors -- still the 
world's largest car maker at 5 million vehicles a year -- and Toyota, now 
second with almost 4 million vehicles a year. Ford will be a leader, and 
probably so will Nissan, producer of more than 2 million cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Then come question marks, including Chrysler, which at 1.7 million vehicles -- 
but with slender finances and few operations outside North America -- may not 
be big enough to go it alone. And Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca may already 
recognize that. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps significantly, in the years since he brought Chrysler back from the 
dead, Iacocca has formed joint production ventures with Mitsubishi of Japan -- 
which makes 1.2 million cars and trucks -- and recently took on U.S. 
distribution of Fiat's Alfa Romeo cars. His actions have led to speculation 
that ultimately, before his retirement in 1991, Iacocca will close the circle 
by placing Chrysler in a global alliance with Fiat and Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
That's speculation, of course, but not so farfetched, given the demands of 
today's car business. "The time will come," says one car expert, "when the 
customer won't know how many companies made the car he's driving." Nothing 
wrong with that so long as it gets good mileage and doesn't break down on the 
road.

SPECULATING IN WATER; 
</P>
<P>
A NEW GENERATION OF ENTREPRENEURS IS SELLING A PRECIOUS RESOURCE TO THE HIGHEST 
BIDDER, WITH POTENTIALLY PROFOUND EFFECTS ON DEVELOPMENT IN THE WEST.

<P>
Tim Griffin, vice principal of Sparks High School in Nevada, could teach a 
course in a venerable American tradition: how to make a quick buck. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin saw the gleam of profit in a letter from the city of Sparks. The city 
wanted to buy an old legal right that Griffin had acquired unwittingly years 
before, along with a four-bedroom tract house. It allowed him to remove 
hundreds of thousands of gallons of agricultural water annually from the 
Truckee River, had the irrigation ditches to transport it still existed. 
</P>
<P>
The city offered him less than $300 for the water right. To Griffin, that 
seemed low. And a Reno lawyer agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin asked whether the law allowed him to compete with the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" shrugged the attorney. 
</P>
<P>
And so Griffin launched a project that just years before would have been no 
more lucrative than corraling roadside beer bottles. 
</P>
<P>
He spent evenings and weekends marching door-to-door through tree-lined 
neighborhoods, offering fellow residents 25% more than Sparks or Reno would pay 
for these small allocations of water. Then he resold bundles of these rights to 
local developers who, as in some other booming Western cities, must now find 
their own supply of water for each new building project. 
</P>
<P>
He is still in the market. For in the past 10 years, the price of water rights 
around Reno has gone from as little as $100 an acre-foot -- roughly the water 
used in two years by a family of four -- to as much as $3,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
In the twilight years of the big Western dam-building projects, with virtually 
every gallon of every river parceled out to cities and farms, water is becoming 
a high-priced commodity, attracting a new generation of speculators and 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs are buying water ranches -- land where water, not hay, is 
harvested. Or, like Griffin, they ferret out old, unused water rights to 
resell. Some farmers raise capital by selling excess water to city water 
districts. Environmental groups are beginning to arrange deals for water that 
preserve wild rivers by essentially buying them up. 
</P>
<P>
And for more sophisticated private investors, there have even been some 
packaged investment deals. 
</P>
<P>
By 1979, water rights began to move briskly in a new market in Colorado. More 
than $100 million has been invested in water there in the years since, 
according to Walraven Ketellapper, a Denver water rights investment manager. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado has also been the scene of the first managed partnership investments 
in water. In 1985, Prudential-Bache Capital Funding and a Denver-based firm 
raised $35 million from various insurance companies to invest in Colorado 
water. The partners will sit on their investment for as long as 15 years, as 
Denver water prices inevitably rise. 
</P>
<P>
Ketellapper himself is one of the managing partners of a second investment 
portfolio project, called Aqueduct I, put together with Prudential-Bache 
Properties. That $7-million limited partnership, the first to be aimed at 
individual investors, wasn't as easy a sell. Set up to accept $30 million, the 
fund stopped signing up new investors last December. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado has also been the scene of environmental deals in the water market. 
For instance, the Nature Conservancy, known as the real estate arm of the 
environmental movement, has taken the first steps to preserve the Black Canyon 
of Colorado's Gunnison River by acquiring water rights. It hopes to apply the 
same technique to the Yampa River in northwest Colorado, the Little Snake River 
along the Wyoming-Colorado border, the San Miguel River in southwest Colorado, 
the Hassayampa River in central Arizona and Aravaipa Creek, just north of 
Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Although the market in Colorado has begun to cool somewhat, Ketellapper sees a 
continuing business in water there as long as the state continues to grow. 
Investors are now prowling Arizona and Nevada, and many observers predict that 
a private market could even develop in the heavily regulated California water 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shortages Stirred Interest 
</P>
<P>
"Investors really want to find a way to get into California," says water policy 
consultant Steven Shupe. 
</P>
<P>
The largest players in the water trade are still likely to be such massive 
public agencies as the Metropolitan Water District in Southern California. But 
interest in private profit got a big boost when water shortages in the West 
became a fixture of the nightly news just as investors reeling from the 
October, 1987, stock market collapse went searching for someplace else to put 
their money. 
</P>
<P>
"When the stock market crashed, and with a big national drought in the national 
magazines," recalls Shupe, "that was a turning point. . . . A lot of folks who 
didn't even know what Western water was were calling me up." 
</P>
<P>
This small but growing business has helped to crystallize a new attitude toward 
the use and price of water: As the West enters an era in which additional water 
supplies are no longer being discovered, captured and divvied up, existing 
supplies must be redistributed from so-called lower-value to higher-value use. 
Water that was once looked upon as a kind of shared human right, like the air, 
is becoming a commodity to be traded like coal or oil, sold to the highest 
bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Such dramatic change doesn't come without casualties, or worry. Rural towns 
remain suspicious of any water sales that could turn their agricultural areas 
into a modern-day version of California's Owens Valley, still shorthand in 
Western water circles for economic rape and pillage. Water in the Owens Valley, 
a once-green agricultural area north of Los Angeles, was secretly bought up and 
then shunted south decades ago, leaving a decimated community behind. 
</P>
<P>
To a surprising extent, however, the new world of Western water often looks 
like a good deal to all concerned -- environmentalists, investors, developers 
and in recent years even many of the "water buffaloes," as the new 
entrepreneurs genially call the large farm interests and the old-guard public 
water administrators. 
</P>
<P>
* Investors see money-making opportunities in a West with finite water sources 
and projected population growth of 45% between 1980 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
* Developers and traditional water administrators see a more open water market 
as the only way for urban growth to continue in many cases. Or as Shupe 
observes: "The alternative to developing a new supply is buying out an existing 
supply." 
</P>
<P>
* Some farmers are quite willing to sell water rights that are now worth more 
than the crops that they would nourish. Some are also coming to accept 
environmentalist arguments that such relatively low-value crops as alfalfa 
won't make sense in a West where water is much more expensive. Meanwhile, 
Congress has little enthusiasm for building more expensive dams. 
Environmentally sound sites are rare now, for one thing. So many farm owners 
are increasingly concerned about the future of federally subsidized irrigation 
water -- particularly "double-dippers," farmers raising subsidized crops with 
subsidized water. 
</P>
<P>
* Although some environmental groups object strongly to an unrestrained water 
market -- in which they might find themselves bidding against private investors 
to keep water in a wild river -- others have long argued for freer transfer of 
water, for having water traded at its true, higher value. They see this as 
encouraging city residents to use water more sparingly and farmers to conserve 
and plant crops that are less water-thirsty. 
</P>
<P>
"When you move price up closer to its actual cost, or beyond that, up to the 
market rate, the users of that water use it more conservatively," says Hal 
Candee, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental group. "And there's a huge capacity for conservation in 
agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand Tops Supply 
</P>
<P>
Marc Reisner, environmental writer and author of "Cadillac Desert," the most 
provocative history of Western water to be discussed among water managers in 
recent years, accuses the traditional water management system of ignoring the 
unrelenting fact that the West is a desert. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is that despite heroic efforts and many billions of dollars," 
Reisner contends, "all we have managed to do in the arid West is turn a 
Missouri-sized section green." And now, with the rights to virtually all rivers 
and lakes owned by someone, underground water is in many cases being sucked out 
faster than it is naturally replenished -- a practice termed ground water 
mining, and "one of the things," Reisner recently predicted, "our grandchildren 
aren't going to like about us." 
</P>
<P>
Yet any grand shift in the use of water faces a tangle of traditional legal 
rights and protections. 
</P>
<P>
"Water law still has one foot mired in the 19th Century," says Shupe. "And here 
we're moving into the 21st, with all sorts of new forces." 
</P>
<P>
Shupe, a New Mexico-based engineer and attorney, has been called the strolling 
minstrel of Western water law. Steering a delicate course aimed at finding 
common, fair solutions among entrepreneurs, environmentalists, public water 
managers, farmers and Indian tribes, Shupe is one of the prominent forces for 
peaceful evolution in Western water policies, often simply by setting up 
workshops that get all factions into the same room. 
</P>
<P>
Still, for the moment, as Mark Twain reportedly put it: "Whiskey is for 
drinking -- water is for fighting over." Century-old webs of legal barriers and 
mutual suspicion often make investment in the water trade a difficult and 
limited business. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, speculation in water has been a hateful thing in the West. And 
this will likely be on state lawmakers' minds as they forge future water laws. 
Many of these new laws and policies will be conceived to control the transfer 
of water for urban growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Risk in Deals 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't going to be a lot of sympathy for developers," predicts Shupe, 
"especially for out-of-state developers." 
</P>
<P>
The largest risk to investors in water may be that city planners' predictions 
of Western urban growth turn out to be far too high, and that water doesn't 
consequently jump in price as much as expected. 
</P>
<P>
Other cautionary notes for investors concern time and the special problems of 
supply. Unlike Griffin's quick killing in Sparks, Nev., most water deals are 
long-term investments. But while investors wait it out, many important issues 
have yet to be decided by state Legislatures and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, a group of investors bought the Lincoln Ranch in Arizona with 
plans to sell its plentiful water well before now. The site seemed auspicious, 
if only because it is next door to Planet Ranch, a successful water ranch owned 
by the city of Scottsdale. But in the "gray area" of Arizona water law, as 
ranch operator Roy Ross puts it, the deal has soured because the partners 
weren't able to make an acceptable sale fast enough. According to Derek L. 
Sorenson, attorney for the bank that holds the mortgage, the partners now face 
foreclosure. The investors hope to form a new partnership structured to hold 
out for the longer haul -- as long as 10 more years. 
</P>
<P>
Drought can also be disastrous to investors. When water supplies are low, those 
who own senior rights -- rights that trace from their first use, often in the 
mid-19th Century -- get water before more junior owners. Investors with these 
"younger" rights could find themselves with a right, but no actual water. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most cheerful, risk-free transactions so far have involved unused 
rights, with no one losing water to which they have become accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Griffin's water right was a forgotten legacy of the land's 
earlier use as an irrigated farm. Water was so cheap when that housing tract 
was built, and city water lines went in, that the developer didn't bother to 
strip off the old right and sell it himself, as would be done today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Griffin says his neighbors thought that the cash that he offered was 
"like Christmas." He and his partner, as the Water Rights Group, didn't do 
badly either, though they decline to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a lot of money," Griffin allows, "but not enough to retire on."

FED BASHING RAISES RISKS OF INFLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM REDBURN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1980s have been a vintage decade for the Federal Reserve, the nation's 
chief inflation fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Only 10 years ago, with prices rising at alarming double-digit rates and the 
value of the dollar collapsing, the central bank had lost all credibility and 
was forced to engineer the worst recession since the end of World War II to 
bring the inflationary spiral to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the downturn in late 1982, though, the U.S. economy has 
behaved like a fine wine that just keeps getting better with age. The nation 
has enjoyed almost seven years of uninterrupted economic growth, largely 
without the customary run-up in inflation. Much of the credit has landed on the 
Fed. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a wine that could quickly turn to vinegar. As the economy moves 
toward fuller use of its labor, factories and other resources, the Fed no 
longer enjoys much room for error. At the same time, the Bush Administration 
appears to be setting up the central bank for blame in any future recession, 
suggesting that the strong political support that the Fed has received for its 
anti-inflation stance is on the wane. 
</P>
<P>
"The road ahead may turn out to be a virtual mine field," Lyle Gramley, a 
former Fed governor, told a recent gathering here of academic experts and 
central bankers from around the world. Although Fed officials know from the 
bitter experience of the 1970s that very low inflation is necessary to ensure 
sustained economic growth, "the politicians may not have learned the same 
lessons," Gramley said. 
</P>
<P>
Fed officials still hope to bring inflation down close to zero, but politicians 
happily tolerate today's rate of inflation -- about 5% a year -- if the only 
cure is a recession. For the present, the Fed tacitly acknowledges that it is 
unlikely to improve on today's inflation rate, a posture that will avert a 
confrontation only as long as price pressures do not mount. 
</P>
<P>
"The best you can expect is a capping of inflation at current levels," 
acknowledged Roger Guffey, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, 
which sponsored the Jackson Hole conference on monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
To Guffey, that means that the Fed should probably aim at keeping interest 
rates high enough to slow the economy to a very modest growth rate of less than 
2% through at least the end of next year. Under such a scenario, inflationary 
pressures might ease, but slow growth and rising unemployment could set off a 
political backlash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fed Officials Baffled 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid we may be expecting too much," Guffey acknowledged. "Political 
pressures could build to the boiling point." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed is already feeling the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, White House budget director Richard G. Darman set off a new 
campaign of public Fed bashing by the Bush Administration. "If we do have a 
recession," he argued in a television interview, "I think it will be because 
they erred on the side of caution." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush later endorsed Darman's statement, calling it "very balanced." 
</P>
<P>
The White House's chief economist, however, was more modest in his comments on 
the Fed last Thursday. While not attacking the Fed directly, Michael J. Boskin 
urged monetary officials to aim for stronger growth. "We would not be satisfied 
with a definition of soft landing that merely avoids a recession," Boskin said. 
</P>
<P>
Fed officials, accustomed as they are to taking the political blame for 
economic downturns, are baffled by the recent wave of Administration attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed managed to nip in the bud a flowering inflation in 1988 and turn the 
corner to an easier monetary policy early enough in 1989 to avoid a recession," 
Gramley said. "That is a remarkably good performance. But it's not good enough 
for the Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Many economists see a danger that the brewing conflict may backfire on the 
White House, pushing up interest rates in the bond market by raising doubts 
among investors about the ability of the Fed to resist political pressures for 
easier money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong-Arming Criticized 
</P>
<P>
In this view, investors realize that easy money will breed inflation -- and 
therefore higher interest rates -- later. Anticipating those higher rates in 
the future, investors bid up rates in the present. 
</P>
<P>
David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services of Chicago, is 
particularly critical of Darman for strong-arming the Fed. In a recent 
newsletter, Hale turned a widely publicized Darman speech against him. 
</P>
<P>
In a July speech, Darman complained that Americans consume too much and save 
too little. He likened Americans to the child in the 1950s commercial who 
screamed: "I want my Maypo! I want it NOW!" 
</P>
<P>
Hale wrote: "In an unintended self-parody. . ., Darman made it clear that he 
wants lower interest rates and, like the child in the Maypo ad of the 1950s, he 
wants them NOWWWW! In fact, a Maypo-style Federal Reserve policy geared to 
instant monetary gratification could be counterproductive for the 
Administration by triggering a resurgence of bond market vigilantism." 
</P>
<P>
Pressure from the White House to avoid an economic slowdown even at the risk of 
higher inflation is only one of the problems facing the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
For all their success in reducing inflation in the 1980s, central bankers at 
the conference here confessed that they depended more on the brute force of 
Draconian interest rates than on any reliable guide to conducting monetary 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Simply trying to engineer a stable money supply, as advocated by "monetarist" 
economists, turned out to be a widespread failure when it was attempted in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s by a number of central banks, including those in the 
United States and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
M-1 De-Emphasized 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, deregulation of banking interest rates led to huge swings 
in the amount of money in checking accounts. That made it impossible for the 
Fed to measure the relationship between the money supply and the output of the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Fed informally dropped its focus on M-1, the measure of money 
held in checking accounts and cash, as early as the summer of 1982 and publicly 
abandoned its use a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Kohn, the Fed's monetary policy staff chief, said measures of the money 
supply will still play a role in conducting policy in the 1990s. But "it is 
more likely to resemble the key supporting part of the late 1980s than the 
romantic lead of the late 1970s and early 1980s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But even with bank deregulation largely over, central bankers see little reason 
to believe that the money supply will become any more useful as a monetary 
policy lodestar. Canada, for example, quit regulating interest rates long 
before the United States did but still experienced the same problems because of 
ongoing changes in financial practices. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect innovation to continue to play an important role in financial 
markets," said Charles Freedman, deputy governor of the Bank of Canada. 
"Periodic unpredictable shifts in monetary and credit aggregates are therefore 
likely to occur in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Central bankers are also facing greater demands to open their deliberations to 
wider public scrutiny. While Fed officials have been far more willing to 
discuss their positions in recent years than in the past, their power to 
operate independently and largely in secret remains far beyond that of most 
other Washington institutions. The only comparable body is probably the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Monetary Risks 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), a widely respected lawmaker who is chairman of 
Congress' Joint Economic Committee, recently introduced a bill with Rep. Byron 
L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) that would force the Fed to include the secretary of the 
Treasury in its decision-making meetings and disclose its minutes immediately, 
rather than about six weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
While the bill has almost no chance of becoming law, hearings on Hamilton's 
proposal are likely to serve as a forum for wide-ranging challenges to the 
Fed's independence. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the challenges for monetary policy are getting tougher rather 
than easier. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told the conference that fast-moving 
changes in global markets and financial systems are "posing new risks. . . . 
Monetary policy will not be functioning in a vacuum in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is why central bankers are worried that the economic shocks of the 
1990s will be a lot different from those of the 1980s. The favorite joke at the 
Jackson Hole conference summed that up best. 
</P>
<P>
Several participants noted that the economy can usually be counted on to 
perform something like Mae West, the famous vaudeville and movie vamp of the 
1920s and '30s. "Whenever I am faced with the choice of two evils," she once 
said, "I choose the one I haven't tried before."

<TEXT>
<P>
Some of those Hank Greenspun afflicted during his life have a joke that they 
tell even now. 
</P>
<P>
At his funeral in July, a crowd of more than 1,200 -- gamblers, politicians, 
friends and employees -- came to stand in the 100-degree desert sun. Some were 
there to say farewell, the joke goes, others to make sure he was really dead. 
</P>
<P>
But a month later, Greenspun had the last laugh. The one-time gun smuggler for 
Israel who ran a newspaper here, called Joe McCarthy a homosexual in print 
without any proof, sued the state's most powerful politician for conspiracy and 
won, and ran a sting operation on the sheriff, showed them he wasn't quite as 
dead as they thought. 
</P>
<P>
Hours before he died, it was announced on Aug. 8, Greenspun's family had signed 
a deal to keep his flagrant but failing newspaper, the Las Vegas Sun, alive for 
another 50 years. The Sun would merge business operations with the town's other 
paper, the profitable Las Vegas Review Journal, but maintain separate news and 
editorial staffs. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun was gone, but his irascible or damnable, crusading or abusive, 
anything-but-timid newspaper was not. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement still must win federal exemption from antitrust laws. And many 
believe, if the two papers become partners, that the furious Sun will change 
its ways, in part because Hank's son, Brian, a gentler soul than his father, is 
running it. Brian had to sign over $20 million worth of family stock in the 
local cable franchise to make the deal and gets just 10% of the papers' 
combined profit in return. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the Sun changes, the merger will preserve a competition that once 
was among the meanest, weirdest, most raucous and -- by modern standards -- 
most unethical newspaper wars ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
It was a war, really, of two men, the two papers' owners, and their two 
different philosophies of life. 
</P>
<P>
One was Herman "Hank" Greenspun, the Brooklyn-born lawyer who came to Las Vegas 
in 1946 fresh from the Army hoping to start a race track and who became a 
celebrated crusader instead. 
</P>
<P>
The other is Donald W. Reynolds, an Oklahoma-bred son of a poor grocery peddler 
who parlayed $300 into a media company so private that few have heard of it. 
Yet Donrey (for Don Reynolds) Media Group owns more daily and weekly newspapers 
around the country than giant Gannett Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carried Gold Cards 
</P>
<P>
And as the owner of every dime's worth of stock, the reclusive 82-year-old 
Reynolds, who moves constantly among his seven homes, is one of America's 55 
billionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Between them there was real dislike, honestly felt. In print, Greenspun usually 
referred to Reynolds as "Uncle Piggy." Friends say that in private, Reynolds 
described Greenspun with expletives. In public, he cleaned it up and just 
called him "Vermin Greenscum." 
</P>
<P>
Nor was either man accused of running a great newspaper. For years, reporters 
here carried gold cards that entitled them to free meals and drinks at local 
hotels, and the papers let their advertising departments influence news 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
It was in 1949 that Reynolds bought the Review Journal, then just his third 
newspaper, and promptly tried to break the unions. The paper that Greenspun 
would buy a year later and call the Sun was actually a strike paper started by 
Review Journal printers. 
</P>
<P>
The town was small and wide open, a collection of low-slung stucco buildings, a 
few casinos and, among the new residents, a mobster named Bugsy Siegel with a 
vision about a city built on the fantasy of greed. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds ran his newspaper for the same reason -- money. He is "strictly a 
bottom-line operator," said former Review Journal General Manager Bill Wright, 
the top executive at the paper from 1966 to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In Reynolds' strategy, the editorial quality of the paper was not a primary 
concern, and the Review Journal was bland at best, though he always spent money 
on equipment to get the paper out fast and with a modern look. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extraordinarily Profitable 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, who would come to own most of the major media in Nevada and most of 
the billboards in Las Vegas, is so frugal, employees said, that he has located 
Donrey's executive offices in a compound with his home so that he can partly 
deduct his house as a business expense. 
</P>
<P>
As Las Vegas grew, Wright said Reynolds used the paper as "the cow that has 
financed his empire," acquiring tiny papers in places like Arkadelphia, Ark., 
and Oskaloosa, Iowa. Today, the 135,000-circulation Review Journal is as big as 
almost all the other Donrey papers combined. 
</P>
<P>
And it is extraordinarily profitable. With revenue of more than $70 million and 
operating profit of more than $20 million a year, according to insiders, the 
Review Journal is more successful financially than all but a couple of Las 
Vegas casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Donrey President Fred Smith denies that the company has little concern for news 
quality. "We are bottom-line oriented," he said. "But we know to have a bottom 
line you have to have a good product." 
</P>
<P>
In Reynolds, Donrey also had a boss who employees say can be could be brutally 
abrupt and explosive. He fired his own son from the company, and his general 
managers call their annual meeting in Lake Tahoe "The Reaming in the Pines." 
</P>
<P>
If Reynolds owned his paper to make a profit, Greenspun owned his to make 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"For Hank, the idea of the Sun was kicking the hell out of everyone who 
deserved it," but "he didn't have the slightest concept of how a newspaper was 
produced on a daily basis," said Bryn Armstrong, executive editor of the Sun 
from 1963 to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
When the race track plan that brought him to Vegas failed, he tried to start a 
magazine and then went to work as a publicist for Siegel's Flamingo hotel. 
After Siegel was murdered in Los Angeles, Greenspun ran into other unsavory 
business partners and finally decided to buy the local strike paper from the 
printers union for $1,000 down. 
</P>
<P>
Before he could start in earnest, he was convicted of smuggling guns to Israel. 
Greenspun had been recruited by the fledgling nation to run guns through Mexico 
three years earlier -- in violation of American neutrality in the Middle East. 
The sentence didn't include jail, however, and Greenspun returned to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lived Up to Promise 
</P>
<P>
At the Review Journal, the publisher's column was called "From Where I Sit." 
With characteristic delicacy, Greenspun called his "Where I Stand," slapped it 
on Page 1 and promised on day one that he would never be impartial. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
His first target was Nevada's most powerful man, Democratic Sen. Patrick 
McCarran, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, boss of the state political 
machine, close ally of Joe McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
"The old buzzard," Greenspun called him in print, leading a pack of "crawling 
sniveling jackals." He warmed up from there, combing the Kefauver hearings for 
links between McCarran and organized crime, writing column after column for 
nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, McCarran retaliated by ordering the casino owners to pull their 
advertising from the Sun. Twelve of the 13 casinos complied within two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun sued the senator and the hotels for conspiracy. Town bookies gave him 
only 20-to-1 odds. But after Greenspun found a casino secretary who took the 
call from Washington with the boycott order, the casinos settled. And 
Greenspun's career was launched. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, McCarran, giving a speech in Hawthorne, Nev., uttered the 
words "Greenspunism must be defeated," and dropped dead. 
</P>
<P>
By then, however, the Sun had gone on to be one of the first papers to publicly 
take on Sen. Joseph McCarthy, who at one point accused Greenspun of being an 
"ex-communist." 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun wrote in a style he called "fighting the devil with his own fire." 
</P>
<P>
It is "common talk," one Greenspun column read, "that Sen. Joe McCarthy has 
often engaged in homosexual activities." Whether Greenspun had any proof was in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Darling of Liberals 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a Greenspun column even predicted that McCarthy would be killed. 
"Huey Long's death will be serene and peaceful compared with the demise of the 
sadistic bum from Wisconsin." 
</P>
<P>
Provoked, McCarthy persuaded the Postmaster General to try to revoke the Sun's 
second-class postage rights, alleging that Greenspun was inciting violence. The 
effort failed, and Greenspun had become a darling of liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, there were other crusades -- helping elect Michael 
O'Callaghan governor, fighting against atomic waste dumping and against the 
Internal Revenue Service -- all of them, in Greenspun's mind, in defense of the 
little guy. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best, though, was the case of Clark County Sheriff Glen Jones and 
"Roxie's" motel brothel, an establishment that had operated for years without 
interference from the law. 
</P>
<P>
When Greenspun accused Jones of being a secret partner in Roxie's, the sheriff 
sued for libel. And Greenspun countered with a bit of journalism not taught in 
any college. 
</P>
<P>
He hired a private investigator to pose as a Mafioso, wired him for sound and 
sent him off to offer to buy Roxie's from its legally entangled owner, Roxie 
Clippinger. 
</P>
<P>
When the fake mobster inquired about "protection" for his investment, Roxie 
assured him that the good sheriff was on the payroll, a claim verified in other 
tape-recorded meetings as well. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-part series in the Sun followed, and Jones dropped his libel suit. 
</P>
<P>
As often as not, Greenspun shot from the hip, writing first, gathering his 
evidence later. Sometimes he was right, and sometimes, even his own editors 
said, he was not. 
</P>
<P>
But he always believed his cause, said O'Callaghan, now a Sun executive, even 
if his many enemies say he never did a thing that wasn't for his own profit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gaming Ignored 
</P>
<P>
At every opportunity, he railed against "Uncle Piggy," and the "knuckleheads" 
who ran "the little paper down the street," always in sarcastic prose. When the 
Reynolds' paper criticized his business dealings, he called it "a eunuch 
judging a man's lovemaking." 
</P>
<P>
With all this crusading, and with Reynolds' penny pinching, why did Reynolds 
ultimately win the war? 
</P>
<P>
First, neither paper was a model of journalistic prestige. 
</P>
<P>
Neither assigned reporters to cover the town's biggest industry -- gaming -- or 
the gaming commission full time until an upstart third paper, the Valley Times, 
began doing so in the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did they cover the mob. It was the Chicago Sun-Times that exposed how Jimmy 
Hoffa used the Teamsters pension fund to bankroll the expansion of Las Vegas in 
the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
And in a practice most newspapers would consider dishonest, for years the 
advertising sections ran the entertainment coverage of the papers -- and only 
those hotels that advertised got stories written about them. 
</P>
<P>
The Review Journal ad department even had a rubber stamp, which it used to mark 
"OK" those press releases that the news staff could put in the paper, usually 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Review Journal General Manager David Osborne says the hotels might have "taken 
advantage" and withheld advertising if the paper hadn't employed such policies. 
He says the policy has since been changed, though advertising experts in town 
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sun, Brian Greenspun freely admits there is a category of story in his 
paper called "puff" -- which means stories written by the hotels themselves -- 
"if they aren't advertisers, they have to wait in line for the space for puff." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, for a time in the 1950s and early 1960s, during Greenspun's 
greatest crusades, the Sun was gaining on the Review Journal. By September, 
1963, only 7,500 in circulation separated them (the Review Journal led with 
35,441 copies). 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the morning of the Nov. 20, fire destroyed the Sun building and 
presses. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun managed to continue publishing, for months flying the paper in from 
California. But delivery was sporadic, often late, and the paper was thin. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Sun rebuilt, the Review Journal had gained a circulation lead 
of more than 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helped Howard Hughes 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun's shortcomings as a manager were another problem. The Sun payroll was 
stocked with relatives, any one of whom -- including the telephone operator -- 
could order stories into the paper. Nor did Hank cover the city in any coherent 
way. He liked to focus on one crusade at a time, didn't like the idea of 
regular beats and disdained covering public meetings. 
</P>
<P>
In his later years, many think even Greenspun's personality and reputation as a 
crusader waned. Some believe that it began to tarnish when, following a 
presidential pardon by John F. Kennedy on the smuggling charges, Greenspun ran 
for governor in 1962 and was soundly beaten in the Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
Others think the decline started when he met Howard Hughes, who Greenspun 
helped to buy the Desert Inn upon Hughes' arrival in Las Vegas in 1966. Over 
the course of the next four years, Hughes and Greenspun would have complex 
business dealings, including a $4-million loan to Greenspun at 3% interest and 
the sale of Greenspun's TV station to Hughes for another $3.6 million, mostly 
so Hughes could program the all-night movies he would watch. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Hughes fled Las Vegas for Nassau in 1970, Greenspun had become 
wealthy, and thereafter, some say, his role as defender of the little guy 
seemed less credible. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics, such as University of Nevada at Reno journalism Prof. Jake 
Highton, contend that the Sun might have beaten the Review Journal had Hank not 
diverted his money into other enterprises. His son counters that it was these 
outside business that have kept the Sun alive, paying for more than $13 million 
in losses since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it is doubtful that Greenspun's paper and personality were suited 
to the battle, even if he had had the money. And by the early 1980s, the Sun 
had entered a downward spiral. Its readers, Review Journal surveys showed, were 
mostly older Las Vegans who were dying out. The growing number of new residents 
read the Review Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the Sun's share of advertising lineage has dropped to less than 30% 
from 40% of the market. Daily circulation has dropped to 29% from 37%. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Greenspuns ever consider selling the paper to preserve it? No, says 
Brian Greenspun. And the two most common rumors in town, that Gannett and Times 
Mirror Co. were interested in buying, are both false, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
But Brian Greenspun claims that as early as 1979, his family approached Donrey 
about a merger. Discussions went nowhere, and in 1985, the Greenspuns tried 
again, this time ready to offer part of the family cable franchise. Again, 
Donrey said no. 
</P>
<P>
The last negotiations began in the summer of 1988, after doctors found that 
Hank had cancer, and by December many of the details were hammered out. 
</P>
<P>
Donrey would get 10% of the local cable company that the Greenspuns owned and 
an option to buy 35% more, if the Greenspuns could maintain majority share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wasn't as Fun 
</P>
<P>
Even this must have tasted bitter. Years earlier, the Greenspuns had gone to 
court to keep Donrey out of the cable business on the basis that it already 
owned one of the local TV stations. Since then, Donrey lost its license for the 
station after the government found that it had cheated advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
Why accept the offer now? Donrey President Smith adamantly denies that it was 
because Hank would no longer be on the scene. Rather, he said, the Greenspuns 
offered more. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Don Reynolds is nearly 83, enfeebled by arthritis and no longer running 
his company day to day. And Hank is gone, like others who carved Las Vegas from 
the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations own most of the casinos now, making their big money on slot 
machines, not high rollers. It isn't the scent of sin and gangsters that brings 
the tourists to town anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Greenspun used to curse the changes, his assistant, Ruthe Deskin, said. 
Running the newspaper wasn't as fun anymore. He didn't always like it that his 
town was growing up.

TIME SLIPS BY SHAREHOLDERS WITH SOME FANCY FOOTWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It takes a rare and special talent to avoid two separate shareholder votes on a 
single deal. But the managers of Time Inc. have managed to rise to the 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction, of course, is the so-called merger with Warner Communications. 
The first end run took place this summer when Time management canceled a 
shareholder vote on the Warner deal and reformulated the deal so that it could 
be done without shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
Although Time denies it, a major reason -- if not the reason -- for changing 
the deal's structure was that Time's shareholders were almost certain to vote 
the deal down. Paramount Communications was offering $200 a share for Time in a 
hostile takeover at the time, and most of Time's holders, if left to their own 
devices, would have taken the $200 and nixed the Warner deal. So Time's 
managers didn't leave the shareholders to their own devices. 
</P>
<P>
The second end run around Time's holders is taking place even as you read this. 
But unlike the canceling of the shareholder vote, which was an obvious and 
crude maneuver, this maneuvering is subtle. So subtle, in fact, that it takes a 
while to explain. 
</P>
<P>
To understand what's going on here, you have to remember that even though Time 
now calls itself Time Warner Inc., it hasn't actually combined with Warner and 
won't do so until later this year. Time, which bought 100 million Warner shares 
for $7 billion cash in July, is finishing the deal by buying Warner's 86.8 
million remaining shares for securities valued at $70 a share. And of those 
securities, $61 consists of two new issues of Time Warner convertible preferred 
stock -- which is where the trick comes in. 
</P>
<P>
In the investment world, "convertible" almost always means "convertible into 
common stock," and that's the way Time Warner has described this deal to the 
world. One of the preferreds is convertible at $200 a share, the company says, 
and the other is convertible at $225. 
</P>
<P>
Watch closely, now. Between them, the two preferreds will have a face value of 
about $5.35 billion, and will be convertible into more than 25 million shares 
of Time Warner common stock. Since Time Warner has about 60 million shares of 
common stock outstanding, issuing the new convertible preferreds is the same as 
increasing the number of Time Warner common shares by more than 40%. 
</P>
<P>
It so happens that New York Stock Exchange rules require that in a case like 
this, an exchange-listed company must get its shareholders' approval to 
increase the number of outstanding shares by more than 20%. In this case, the 
20% threshold is about 12 million new shares. Issuing more than 12 million new 
shares without stockholder authorization would force the NYSE to throw Time 
Warner off the exchange: a major embarrassment to the company. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the New Math, a 25-million share increase is more than a 12-million 
share increase. So how can Time Warner issue its $5.35 billion of convertible 
stock without getting thrown off the New York Stock Exchange? Because, it turns 
out, the new preferred stock isn't really convertible into common stock -- 
unless Time Warner shareholders first approve the issuance of the new common 
shares and at this point, no such vote is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the preferred stocks are convertible into something called 
"participating preferred stock" at $190 and $213.75 a share, respectively, 
rather than at the $200 and $225 conversion prices that Time has told people 
about. (Don't even ask what the "participating preferred stock" is. Just accept 
that it's not a security that Time Warner wants to issue and it isn't a 
security you want to own.) 
</P>
<P>
This fascinating "participating preferred" makes a fleeting appearance in the 
part of Time Warner's press release that's designed not to be read or 
understood: three dense, single-spaced paragraphs tucked in the middle of an 
otherwise lucid, double-spaced release. You have to read these so-called 
technicals and then plow through Time Warner's formal filing at the Securities 
and Exchange Commission to figure this out. 
</P>
<P>
The Time Warner public relations people -- who, as far as I can tell, didn't 
intentionally mislead anyone, but were as confused as anyone by the 
technicalities -- say the company isn't free to discuss any aspect of this 
deal, other than what's written in the press release. 
</P>
<P>
But Time Warner has apparently explained its "participating preferred" move to 
some securities analysts and to the New York Stock Exchange the same way that a 
football team about to execute a trick play usually alerts the referee and 
linemen. You don't want to be called for a penalty when you are technically 
within the rules. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, presumably, Time Warner will get around to asking its 
shareholders to approve issuing the new shares that its managers have already 
publicly committed the company to issuing -- and the whole thing will probably 
sail right through. 
</P>
<P>
That couldn't have been said a few months ago when many large Time shareholders 
were upset that the company end ran them and did the Warner deal without a 
shareholder vote. Given that history, the company could have had a fight on its 
hands had it asked the shareholders for permission to issue a huge number of 
new shares to consummate a transaction that many were opposed to in the first 
place. Failing to get approval wouldn't have queered the deal, but it would 
have limited Time Warner's financial flexibility and greatly increased the cost 
of the transaction, which is already hellishly expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner obviously made all the disclosures legally required: I had access 
only to publicly available documents and figured out what was going on. But a 
corporation that still fancies itself a journalism company with a duty to truth 
should live up to the spirit of the securities laws, as well as to their 
letter. Don't hold your breath waiting for that to happen.

ARCO SOLAR SALE TO SIEMENS WILL NOT BE AN ENERGY DRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two letters published Aug. 27 completely missed the mark in describing the 
proposed sale of Atlantic Richfield Co.'s solar subsidiary to Siemens AG. 
</P>
<P>
One writer raised the fear that Arco Solar's advanced photovoltaic (PV) 
technology would "slip away" from the United States, presumably never to 
return. Echoing this theme, the second writer said the sale would prevent 
America from "contributing to the final solution of the triple crises of our 
time: energy, air pollution and the greenhouse effect." 
</P>
<P>
To both statements, Arco's response: not true. Upon completion of the sale, 
Arco Solar will become part of Siemens' U.S. group of companies, which employ 
30,000 people in 46 states. It is Siemens' intention to retain Arco Solar's 
management, staff and manufacturing facility in Camarillo and to continue the 
outstanding research and development work done there over the years. 
</P>
<P>
PV technology does not "slip away" from one country to another. Whatever 
scientific advances that Arco Solar will make under Siemens' management will 
find application in the United States, one of the world's largest PV markets. 
The truth is that the most efficient photovoltaic technology in the world today 
-- single crystal technology -- is already in the public domain. Should the 
technology ever reach a point where it can help solve the world's environmental 
problems, the application will be universal, just as it is now. 
</P>
<P>
Arco has invested over $200 million in Arco Solar over the past 12 years. By 
contrast, government technology funding for Arco Solar has totaled about $3 
million. Arco Solar has never been profitable, and the sale price will not come 
close to covering Arco's 12-year investment. 
</P>
<P>
Arco's management chose Siemens because Siemens made the commitment to maintain 
Arco Solar's leadership in photovoltaics and because Siemens has the expertise 
and financial resources to do so. Arco is proud of Arco Solar's achievements, 
and we look forward to its continued success under Siemens' management.

ENTREPRENEURS CHART PLANS TO SELL THEIR GROUND WATER TO THIRSTY CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The playing field of the new water market is still being laid out. In two of 
the largest water deals by private entrepreneurs so far, eventual profits are 
likely to be affected by decisions still to be made by politicians and the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
Franklyn Jeans, for instance, is betting that his Nevada water basin won't be 
too well-connected to the water basins of his California neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Jeans, a former newspaper reporter and Oakland attorney, bought a $2-million 
ranch in the Honey Lake Valley, north of Reno, to raise alfalfa and cattle. He 
found an unexpected bonanza of underground water, lost his interest in cows and 
is now planning an $86-million water pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The idea struck him on a train ride back to Oakland one Sunday in November, 
1985. Jeans, a self-confident Westerner, was commuting regularly then, spending 
one week at work on the new ranch and the next at his law business in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
On the train with his wife, Susan, now a vice president of one of his 
companies, Jeans read a report by Bob Firth, manager of water resources for 
Westpac Utilities, the Reno water company. The report warned that the city was 
running out of municipal water. 
</P>
<P>
The next time that he was in Reno, Jeans arranged to meet Firth. 
</P>
<P>
"If I told you there was maybe 12,000 acre feet of available (water) supply in 
the Honey Lake Valley," Jeans remembers asking him, "what would you do?" 
</P>
<P>
"He said," recalls Jeans, smiling at the memory of the normally taciturn Firth, 
' "I'd kiss you.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taking Most of Risk 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, the deal with Westpac fell through. Jeans has since become 
partners with Washoe County in an arrangement that leaves him risking $4 
million in start-up costs for a possible $12-million return -- his share of the 
$120-million sale of permanent water rights at an expected $6,000 per 
acre-foot. 
</P>
<P>
He admits that this is a "premium" return, but points out that his company is 
taking the biggest share of risk in a private-sector structure that he predicts 
will become more common around the West. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be if the government wanted to build a water infrastructure 
project, build Hoover Dam," says Jeans, "it went out and took taxpayer's money 
and it spent $5 million to do a study so that all the government types would be 
protected if it went bad. And then they'd hire a contractor for $40 million and 
they'd build a facility. And then they'd use tax revenues to pay the bonds 
off." 
</P>
<P>
The Honey Lake pipeline project, Jeans notes, is financed not by current 
taxpayers but by fees that ultimately will be passed on to new homeowners. 
"It's the incoming people," he says, "who get to pay for the right to move 
here. . . . In effect, what we're doing is we're putting a cost on moving here 
that will help us keep the quality of life up." 
</P>
<P>
Jeans takes pains to point out that his scheme will not end up as a repeat of 
the ecological disaster that befell Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Jeans says, only the amount of underground water that is 
naturally replaced each year in the Honey Lake basin will be piped south. There 
will be no ground water mining. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Honey Lake Valley, at least on the Nevada side, is almost uninhabited, he 
points out. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't develop ground water basins," says Jeans, "in areas where there's 
substantial population, because it just screws it up for the people who are 
there. You've got to go find essentially isolated agricultural areas." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans Water Ranch 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly the point made by the 4,000 Honey Lake Valley residents on the 
California side, who apparently share a set of interconnected water basins. 
Their concern is that their water table will drop when Jeans starts pumping. A 
U.S. Geological Survey team has been studying the basins and both sides hope 
that modern hydrology will help produce a fair plan for dividing the water. 
</P>
<P>
A far larger ruckus has been raised over the project of Ron Ober, a Phoenix 
developer. Ober is piecing together a 30,000-acre water ranch in rural western 
Arizona. He plans to sell water to the cities, when the price is right. 
</P>
<P>
At the current price that Phoenix is paying, Ober's water would be worth about 
$85 million, and that's not counting the cost of pumping it out of the ground 
and transporting it to the cities. Ober thinks that the $85 million could be as 
little as 5% of the total price that cities will ultimately pay. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's urban areas are in a squeeze. When former presidential candidate 
Bruce Babbitt was governor, he promoted and signed a water law that bans ground 
water mining around the cities. But the law also requires cities to demonstrate 
that they have additional water supplies, enough to last 100 years, for any new 
development. 
</P>
<P>
An unforeseen consequence has been to force the politically powerful cities to 
cast a covetous eye on rural water basins, where legally almost any amount can 
be taken. The state Legislature has lately been trying to develop yet another 
water bill, to both meet the cities' needs and treat rural residents decently. 
</P>
<P>
But this year's bill foundered when the site of Ober's ranch, La Paz County's 
water basin, became what Babbitt, now an attorney representing the county, 
termed "the designated victim," the only rural area that would be left open to 
big-time ground water mining. La Paz politicians stopped the bill by 
complaining loudly in the Arizona press that they were about to become "another 
Owens Valley." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rules Could Change 
</P>
<P>
But water for Arizona's cities, where most voters live, must come from 
somewhere, and the biggest water ranch scheme in La Paz County, not to mention 
the state, is Ober's. This gives him a lot of clout in the Legislature, and in 
the fight over the latest water bill, many environmentalists and rural 
Arizonans considered Ober to be wearing a gray if not black hat. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are concerned, for one thing, that he plans to mine the 
ground water, not treat it as a renewable resource. 
</P>
<P>
Ober has already committed himself financially. Some water-policy observers see 
considerable risk in this, since the Legislature can come along later and set 
new rules for Arizona ground water. 
</P>
<P>
Ober doesn't agree, especially in light of the powerful need for water in the 
state. "The bottom line," he says, citing the simple economic engine that still 
drives the West, "is that it's probably all going to get sold, because there is 
more demand than there is supply." 
</P>
<P>
Ober doesn't necessarily mean this literally. For instance, in the failed 
Arizona water bill of this spring, La Paz County's water would have been 
divided, with 65% being open to sale, and 35% being kept in the ground, for the 
locals' future use. 
</P>
<P>
Ober could even hear less environmental concern over his proposed ground water 
mining -- or in water parlance, an overdraft, when underground water is taken 
out faster than nature replaces it. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to just say, 'ground water overdraft is bad,' " Thomas Graff, a senior 
attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund, notes. "We now say, 'It's 
something to worry about, because you want to husband resources over the long 
haul.' On the other hand, we mine everything else. We mine coal. We mine oil." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Graff isn't about to encourage ground water mining. 
</P>
<P>
"You build up an economy based on water that you eventually exhaust, and then 
what?" he asks. "You have to go somewhere else, and usually that means 
environmental degradation in some distant locale."

LAS VEGAS IS BLASE ABOUT PLAN TO MERGE NEWSPAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Usually, a proposal to merge two newspapers into a monopoly evokes all kinds of 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
But so far in this desert city, the plan to merge the Las Vegas Sun and Review 
Journal, while keeping separate news and editorial staffs, has barely generated 
so much as a spark amid the local neon. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Lalli, managing editor of the Nevada Casino Journal, a trade magazine 
covering the gaming industry, has taken out small ads in both papers trying to 
raise a protest. 
</P>
<P>
After some trepidation, the local chapter of the Society of Professional 
Journalists is meeting to discuss the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The affected unions have complained about the jobs that will be lost in the 
consolidation of the business and printing side, but other unions have remained 
silent. And one state senator has offered criticism, though the congressional 
delegation is in favor. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, in such cities as Seattle or Detroit, citizens' groups have 
demanded and won public hearings and have sued when the local papers proposed 
similar so-called newspaper joint operating agreements, which grant special 
exemptions to federal antitrust laws under the Newspaper Preservation Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enormous Sway 
</P>
<P>
Still, the concerns raised quietly here are the usual ones: that one newspaper 
agency will have the power to dictate advertising rates; that it will smother 
potential competition, and that, despite assurances to the contrary, two 
newspapers that are business partners cannot truly be editorial rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Some evidence suggests that the papers already have enormous sway over 
advertisers, particularly in the absence of much suburban competition. For 
instance, both papers already have enough clout to charge hotels a higher rate 
for ads than other businesses. And Donrey Media Group owns so much in Nevada -- 
from the papers in Carson City, Las Vegas and Ely, to one of the country's 
biggest outdoor billboard companies, to radio stations and a Reno TV station -- 
that it already is a force with advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
Smothering competition may be less of a concern. At present, neither paper does 
much specialized coverage of suburban areas and thus may be vulnerable to 
suburban upstarts. Already since the merger was announced, one suburban weekly 
has started up. 
</P>
<P>
As for preserving the editorial spunk of the Sun, some evidence suggests things 
could be different from now on. Even Sun President Brian Greenspun admits that 
he no longer feels the same animus toward his newspaper rival, nor does he 
expect to refer in print to Donrey Chairman Donald Reynolds as "Uncle Piggy," 
as his father did. 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, that's changed," Greenspun said. "He's saving this newspaper for 
whatever his motives." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Studying Plan 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the quiet here is that the Sun is not owned by a large chain, as 
the so-called failing paper is in Detroit. Chains, with their great wealth, 
usually have a hard time persuading the public that one of their newspapers is 
failing, which is what is legally required under the Newspaper Preservation 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
Readers in Las Vegas may also be more likely to believe that the Sun is really 
in trouble. In a wrinkle that analysts say is unprecedented in the history of 
such mergers, the Sun is giving Donrey Media Group $20 million worth of cable 
company stock and is taking only 10% of the combined newspaper profits. 
Usually, the profit sharing is more equitable. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department's antitrust division is now studying the merger plan.

COSTLY SUBSTITUTES FOR REPLACING LOVE OF A HUMAN BEING

Things aren't going too well for Luton and Patina Mears. Their grown daughter 
has moved home to the family trailer and is on her way to establishing a bad 
reputation. You see, Patina is submerged in religion. And Luton is into his pet 
turtles, which he frequently brings inside to watch "Bonanza" with him. He used 
to have dogs until Patina "accidentally" poisoned them. Now she's on a campaign 
to set the turtles free. 
</P>
<P>
That's the sorry situation in Boron, Calif., in Thomas Strelich's "Neon 
Psalms," opening this weekend at Theatre West in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
"The premise I wanted to explore was: Is there a substitute for the love of 
another human being?" said Strelich, a Santa Barbara playwright. "Can pets, can 
memories, can religion -- can any of those things -- serve as a substitute? And 
if they are used as substitutes, what is the price exacted?" 
</P>
<P>
In this case, it's a high one. 
</P>
<P>
During the Vietnam War, Patina had persuaded their only son to enlist in the 
Army, saying his father wouldn't respect him if he didn't serve his country. 
"She didn't want him killed," Strelich noted, "but that was the result." Now 
she turns on her daughter, probably driving her away for good. "She tells 
Luton, 'He keeps taking things away from us, till all we have is Him.' But what 
she's really doing is stripping things away so that -- even by default -- he'll 
pay some attention to her." 
</P>
<P>
Strelich, 36, who supervised the play's staging at San Francisco's Magic 
Theatre in 1985 and New York City's American Place in 1987, has since rewritten 
its ending, which he described as "very bleak, a stalemate: the battle's over 
and no one's a winner." In the new ending, Patina has a physical breakdown: "I 
wanted a feeling that the last thing she could take away from Luton was herself 
and that when she did, he finally comes to her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very much a playwright's conceit to have it be dark and mean," he added. 
"But I wanted a sense of resolution, a sense of conclusion. I always think, 'If 
I was sitting in the audience, would I be satisfied? Would I feel good about 
that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Strelich, whose last play, "Dog Logic" (about a nonconformist pet cemetery 
owner doing battle with land developers), played at South Coast Repertory in 
1988, says that characters, rather than plot, are often his motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"Psalms" also benefitted from some real-life observations. When Strelich was a 
graduate student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, he too lived in a ramshackle 
trailer. His girlfriend was from Boron and her father, like Luton, had driven a 
truck in a Borax mine. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd go back to visit her mother. I'd go on walks around Boron," Strelich 
said. "One time I was in an alley and passed a back yard with maybe 10 turtles 
in it, each with a number painted on its back. So when I was writing this, a 
couple of images from back then clicked." 
</P>
<P>
With his third play ready to open (he also got a grant from the National 
Endowment for the Arts last year, plus a commission for a new work for South 
Coast), Strelich admits that this wasn't a career he'd counted on. 
</P>
<P>
"I love play writing," he said. "But when I was in college, I had to take 
bonehead English -- like 'This is a sentence.' Well, I was good at science. 
Still, I always knew I wanted to write. But you've got to eat first, then 
philosophize. So I majored in biology." 
</P>
<P>
Nearing graduation, Strelich realized that there weren't many high-paying jobs 
for marine biologists and got a double major in computers. He's been working as 
a systems analyst ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"It works out really well," he said of his job at General Research Corp. in 
Santa Barbara. "I come and go as I please. As long as I get the job done, I 
earn my keep. When we were with this play in New York for two months, I just 
took my modem along." 
</P>
<P>
Strelich lived in Los Angeles from 1984 through 1988, but commuted at least 
once a week to Santa Barbara. Now he's doing the commute in the other 
direction, regularly driving in to check on rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was acting in college and I had a habit of changing lines," he said of his 
theater beginnings. "There was this grizzled old director named Murray, an 
ex-Marine, 5 feet tall, 300 pounds. He'd say, 'Strelich, if you can write a 
better play, write it. Otherwise, leave it alone.' So I wrote a one-act, and 
arranged to produce and direct it. I wanted to be sure if it stunk, I'd have 
nobody to blame but myself. It ran for one night. People laughed when they were 
supposed to laugh. And I thought, 'OK, I can do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Becoming a published playwright, though, was far from easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no connections in the theater world -- nothing," said Strelich, who was 
born in Bakersfield. "So I had to do it all on my own. But I've been very 
fortunate: In the last six years, I've always had something in production. I've 
also been lucky in working with really good theaters. I've even gotten good 
rejection letters, hand-signed letters like, 'We really like your work; if you 
have anything else, we'd like to see it.' 
</P>
<P>
"A good rejection letter can keep you going for a couple of years."

Nicholas, one of the two rarely seen beaked whales that washed up on a San 
Francisco area beach two weeks ago has died of pneumonia, officials said. The 
second whale, nicknamed Alexander, remained in stable but guarded condition. 
Officials at Marine World Africa USA animal park in Vallejo said the prospects 
for Alexander's survival remained very poor, only about 5%. The species has 
never been known to survive in captivity. Both ailing whales had been force-fed 
a liquid mixture of seafood.

The Navy launched its newest Trident nuclear submarine, the $1.2-billion 
Pennsylvania, at New London, Conn., while about 100 anti-nuclear activists 
protested. Six of them were arrested and charged with criminal trespass and 
reckless operation of a motor vessel after they crossed Coast Guard barriers 
and tried to affix an anti-nuclear flag to the submarine. They were released 
after posting bond. Demonstrators organized by Greenpeace, an environmental and 
anti-nuclear group, fired mock missiles from a 40-foot boat made up to look 
like a submarine and dubbed the "Expennsylvania" in an attempt to ridicule the 
Navy's Trident program. The 560-foot-long Pennsylvania is the second ballistic 
missile submarine equipped to carry the Trident 2, which has a range of up to 
4,000 miles and an accuracy of within 200 yards.

West Virginia voters handed Gov. Gaston Caperton an overwhelming defeat on 
three constitutional amendments he had said were necessary to complete his 
reorganization of state government. With 99% of the vote counted, only one of 
the proposals garnered as much as 19% support. One of the amendments would have 
eliminated three statewide elected offices -- secretary of state, treasurer and 
agriculture commissioner -- and placed their duties under the governor's 
control. The second amendment would have given the governor greater authority 
over the state primary and secondary education system. The third would have 
given cities and counties the ability to merge or choose new forms of 
government. Caperton, a Democrat who took office in January, said his 
Administration failed to fully explain the proposals.

The United States and South Korea reached tentative agreement on a treaty to 
end South Korean harvesting of U.S.-origin salmon off the Northwest and Alaskan 
coasts. Similar drift-net treaties were negotiated earlier this year with Japan 
and Taiwan, whose fleets also fish in international waters in the North 
Pacific. A U.S. official said the treaties provide for a cooperative program to 
minimize catching of salmon spawned in the United States.

The Little Red Riding Hood of today is a "real wimp" compared to the original 
heroine of ancient folk tales on which the character is based, according to UC 
Berkeley anthropologist Alan Dundes. "Male writers completely ruined the tale . 
. .," said Dundes. "They made the girl a weak little thing who had to be 
rescued. The original folk tale is a female story in which the mother sends the 
daughter out and the little girl is triumphant." What's more, he said, she 
didn't wear a hood, red or otherwise. He said the culprits who rearranged the 
tale were 17th-Century French writer Charles Perrault and, later, the Grimm 
brothers -- Jacob and Wilhelm.

South Lake Tahoe Mayor Neva Roberts is proposing that all of her city's 
employees be required to submit to drug testing. Roberts said "Operation Deep 
Snow," a 20-month federal investigation that led to the arrests of former Mayor 
Terry Trupp and 24 others on drug charges, showed the need for the action. "It 
(the community) may never be 100% (drug free), but the best place to start is 
by example," she said.

A parliamentary commission unexpectedly rejected two Cabinet members proposed 
by Poland's new prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki. The agriculture commission 
turned down Czeslaw Janicki, of the United Peasants' Party, as a deputy prime 
minister and minister for agriculture, and Rural Solidarity activist Artur 
Balazs as minister without portfolio for agricultural development. Sources said 
the commission saw no reason to create what is a new post for Balazs to work 
alongside the Agriculture Ministry. Concerning the rejection of Janicki, the 
PAP news agency said that at least one commission member found Janicki's 
answers to questions too general. The commission's decision is not binding.

NASSCO SHOWS DAMAGED PART OF VALDEZ HULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Butterfield, a National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding employee who helped 
build the Exxon Valdez during the mid-1980s, summed up the feeling when he 
first saw the hull of the ill-fated tanker. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you feel strange," said Butterfield, who is acting as ship's manager 
for repair work that will begin next week in a Nassco graving dock on San Diego 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the company gave the public its first glimpse at the severely 
damaged tanker when it opened the dock to news media. 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez's left side was largely undamaged in March when the tanker ran 
aground on a submerged reef in Alaska, causing the nation's worst oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eerie Scene 
</P>
<P>
But the right side of the tanker, which sits on concrete and wooden blocks, 
presents an eerie spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
When the tanker ran aground, whole sheets of three-quarter-inch steel that form 
the Exxon Valdez's hull were twisted and bent -- or completely torn away. Other 
metal sheets were cut off by divers earlier this summer as the ship waited to 
enter the repair yard. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the steel "stiffeners" that formed the ill-fated tanker's skeleton are 
missing or crumpled beyond recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Two huge boulders -- one the size of a Volkswagen Bug -- that were scooped from 
the ocean's bottom and carried from Alaska to San Diego remain wedged in the 
hull. A 
</P>
<P>
nearby sign alerts visitors to "rocks and falling debris." 
</P>
<P>
Ballast tanks and oil tanks, all of which have been emptied and cleaned, are 
visible where the hull has been peeled away. The hull has been marked up by a 
National Transportation Safety Board crew that is surveying the ship as part of 
the federal government's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The most damage occurred toward the middle of the right side, where there is a 
gaping hole about 300 feet by 80 feet. An observer standing below the ship can 
easily see the massive oil tanks -- as well as the deck that towers nearly 100 
feet above. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Humbling Experience' 
</P>
<P>
"We build ships, we don't sail them," Nassco President Richard Vortmann said 
Saturday. "But it's a humbling experience to see what Mother Nature can do to 
three-quarter-inch steel. The damage is extensive." 
</P>
<P>
Vortmann knows of no other tanker to have been repaired after absorbing so much 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Vortmann compared the repair job to a "child playing with blocks . . . you have 
to remove the damaged blocks before you replace them with new blocks." 
</P>
<P>
Crews will first cut away the bulbous bow section, which, although undamaged, 
must be removed so crews can get at the 12 compartments that were damaged. Once 
all the damaged sections have been removed, Nassco will rebuild the ship to its 
original specifications. 
</P>
<P>
The $25-million repair job is expected to take about nine months. It's 
expensive, but the cost of repairing the ship falls far below the $130 million 
to $150 million it would cost to build a new one, Vortmann said.

FOR MANY PUPILS, SCHOOL HEALTH EXAMS CAN SPELL BIG DIFFERENCE FOR FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first-grader smiled shyly as school nurse-practitioner Sue Horn measured 
his height and weight, then asked him to walk and hop along a straight line of 
masking tape on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego city schools nurse measured his difficulty in hopping with one 
foot along the line, in drawing a circle and square, choosing the colors green 
and yellow, and in following directions for "above" and "behind." 
</P>
<P>
Horn completed the hourlong physical exam with an extensive check of his eyes, 
spine, heart and lungs and the taking of urine and blood samples, at the same 
time noting the child's limited vocabulary for his age in responding to simple 
questions. And all the while, she both tried to reassure the boy's mother about 
the problems showing up and to assimilate information the mother was pouring 
forth, including the fact she was on drugs during the boy's pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rush to Meet Requirements 
</P>
<P>
Horn and the elementary school's regular nurse subsequently have scheduled 
appointments between the boy and school specialists in speech and language, and 
in special physical education, to draw up plans for helping improve his motor 
skills and spur overall development. So far, however, they have had less luck 
in persuading the parents to visit a nearby pediatric clinic for additional 
medical checks, even 
</P>
<P>
though it would be covered free through their Medi-Cal health eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Horn, along with colleagues throughout San Diego County and the state, will be 
extremely busy during the next three months as they scramble to meet 
requirements of a California state law for all first-graders to receive 
physical examinations. Countywide, there are more than 37,000 eligible 
students, with 483,000 across California. 
</P>
<P>
In a majority of cases, parents have already arranged for the exams themselves 
with their regular pediatricians, who send the results to school nurses and 
note areas where school specialists can follow up. 
</P>
<P>
But to cover the growing number of cases of families on limited incomes with no 
medical care -- such as the boy examined by Horn the other day -- the state 
provides funds to all county health departments. For smaller school districts 
such as Oceanside, county health administrators make arrangements with 240 area 
doctors to perform the physicals. In cases such as the San Diego Unified 
district, the nation's eighth largest, the health department contracts with the 
district's nursing division. The state spends $86 million annually for its 
Child Health and Disability Prevention Program. 
</P>
<P>
"Schools try to be forceful on compliance," but there are no penalties for 
districts not able to persuade parents to schedule exams, even at no cost, said 
Phyllis Elkind, who monitors the program in San Diego County. "It depends on 
both the nature of the student population as well as district commitment . . . 
the lower figures are generally but not always in areas with higher turnover of 
kids, with language barriers, and where they are close to the border." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unknown Health Problems 
</P>
<P>
Statewide compliance last year was 82.5% of all first-graders, with the county 
figure slightly below. For individual county districts, percentages ranged from 
55.4% in National City, 56.1% in San Ysidro, 61% in San Marcos, 72.7% in 
Oceanside, 78.6% in San Diego Unified, 86% in Poway, to 100% in Lemon Grove, 
Rancho Santa Fe and Valley Center. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the health screenings find that one in 10 children has an unknown 
health problem, with the figure 15% in San Diego County, Elkind said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 20% of students countywide annually whose parents ignore requests for 
screening, Elkind said they present little if any health risk to the general 
school population, in large part because the parents must nevertheless have 
presented proof of required immunizations for acute contagious diseases before 
enrollment is permitted. 
</P>
<P>
"The (lack of a screening) creates more of an individual problem, in that we 
might miss problems in vision, or hearing, or not notice developmental delays 
or congenital type of problems that will become more serious in later years," 
Elkind said. 
</P>
<P>
Horn's examination of the first-grader touched on the many issues that urban 
schools face in trying to improve the health of children from lower 
socioeconomic areas. The exam was the first that the boy had received since 
being treated in an emergency room for epilepsy several years earlier, the 
mother told Horn. Despite Medi-Cal eligibility, neither the boy nor his little 
sister has a pediatrician. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wondered how much things would cost," she said. Not until the 
mother received one of many fliers sent out by the school beginning nine months 
ago did she learn that the screening could be done free. The mother's concern 
was evident, as she asked Horn questions during the exam and even asked to have 
the wall poster warning against drugs to show her husband, whom she said is 
still hooked on them as well as on alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
But Horn said that, although many parents are genuinely interested in their 
children's health, they have little understanding of how to use the school 
system or the health establishment to their benefit. Even for those who agree 
to the screenings, only about half accompany their children, school district 
figures show. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so frustrating, especially in arranging follow-ups," Horn said later. In 
the case of the boy's exam, "all the parents have to do is make one call to the 
nearby clinic, but so far, nothing has been done . . . when I called the father 
the other day, he told me that his child is fine, no need to see a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Horn said she and other nurses have the responsibility to talk with parents 
over and over, letting them know that the nurses and the system "are there to 
help" and somehow get the parents involved. 
</P>
<P>
But the schools can juggle classroom placement, arrange special tutoring for 
language development, and monitor improvements even without full parent 
participation, Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
Adds colleague Steve Martin, a nurse-practitioner at Sherman Elementary School: 
"With these screenings, at least the school can find out early about chronic 
conditions that will affect a student's education. . . . Otherwise, they might 
not be picked up until the third or fourth grade" when the student is so far 
behind developmentally that problems become major." 
</P>
<P>
Were the state program not available, Horn said, many more children would fall 
through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
"And among those kids, we'd miss (developmental problems) that later could show 
up as poor attendance, discipline problems, not doing homework, and even 
eventually dropping out," she said.

PLANTING TREES IN THE DATABANK; 
</P>
<P>
URBAN FORESTS ARE LOGGED -- IN THE COMPUTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pity the poor Schinus terebinthifolius. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing gracefully and uncomplainingly under the alias "Brazilian pepper 
tree," 2,857 of this particular species of Schinus provide shade and oxygen for 
Santa Ana residents each day. 
</P>
<P>
And what do they get for their troubles? A recommendation in a recently 
completed, $82,000 Street Tree Management Report that "high-maintenance trees 
such as Brazilian pepper" be removed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're phasing them out," said Larry Christian, the city's maintenance manager. 
"They have a small red fruit that causes a lot of problems throughout the year. 
And as soon you get through trimming them, they look like they need it again. 
Plus, they have a root mass that causes a lot of sidewalk, curb and gutter 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
Tree lovers rest assured: Santa Ana has no intention of denuding its urban 
forest. The peppers, and other trees slated for removal, will be replaced by 
species that cause less damage and are easier to maintain: London plane, 
Bradford pear or Brisbane box, for example. 
</P>
<P>
The tree report is the result of an exhaustive, computerized inventory of every 
city-owned tree in Santa Ana performed by Irvine-based Golden Coast 
Environmental Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities are putting nature on a database, too. Golden Coast is nearly 
finished with a $48,000 inventory for the city of Costa Mesa, and it will soon 
start a project for Irvine. In the last few years, it has computerized the 
urban forests of downtown Orange, Redondo Beach, Santa Monica, Santa Barbara 
County, Encinitas and the city of Riverside -- a 2 1/2-year, $160,000 
accounting of 106,000 trees -- among others. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, Golden Coast's arborists spent eight months walking the streets 
and carefully punching into computers the exact location, species, diameter, 
height and condition of every city-owned tree. The city's maintenance 
department now has that information on a computer database and can call up a 
particular tree's record, or the location of all trees of a given species, or 
height, or condition, at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
For instance: A quick check of the data shows that Mayor Pro Tem John Acosta 
has one city-owned tree in front of his house on West Orange Avenue -- a 
healthy Cinnamomum camphora, or camphor tree, about two feet in diameter and 
between 15 and 40 feet tall (the trees are not measured exactly but instead 
</P>
<P>
placed in one of five height classifications for easier maintenance). 
</P>
<P>
Other information included in the report: 
</P>
<P>
* Santa Ana owns 41,259 trees worth an estimated $120 million and has room to 
plant another 8,386 trees. 
</P>
<P>
* There are 182 species in the city, but eight make up 64% of the total. Oaks 
(10.7%) predominate, followed by jacarandas (10.2%) -- the lavender-blossoming 
trees that distinguish many of the city's neighborhoods -- queen palms, 
peppers, carrotwood, Brisbane box, ashes, sweet gums and sycamores. 
</P>
<P>
* Overall, Santa Ana's trees are healthy. But many of its trees are beginning 
to show signs of "nonspecific tree decline," a mysterious malady untraceable to 
any specific cause. Also, Santa Ana, being an older city, has trees that are 
advanced in age. "This type of population can potentially cause problems," the 
report warns. 
</P>
<P>
* Several species cause too much damage to sidewalks and streets or require too 
much maintenance, and should be phased out. Besides the Brazilian peppers, the 
report recommends the gradual removal of Indian laurel figs, sweet gums and 
date palms. 
</P>
<P>
Some might question the value of all this information, but Clint Jones, Santa 
Ana's maintenance supervisor, has no doubt that the new system is a wise 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really going to tell the truth, the whole picture," Jones predicted. 
</P>
<P>
When Jones came to Santa Ana in 1974, he was told that the city owned about 
150,000 trees. But Jones, who had previously supervised tree maintenance in 
Anaheim -- a city of just 50,000 trees -- knew better. 
</P>
<P>
"I wondered where they hid them all," Jones said. "I started a card file on all 
of them and came up with about 43,000." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Jones has come to know most of his trees "by character," he 
said. "You get to know the trees even before you know the streets." 
</P>
<P>
The index card file, which Jones put together with the help of his wife and 
city work crews, and which has served the city well for almost 15 years, is 
simply no match for the new, computerized system. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to know how many Brazilian pepper trees we have, and where they 
are, we just bring it right up," Jones said. "It's going to save a heck of a 
lot of legwork." 
</P>
<P>
The computer system will also save the city money over the long run by allowing 
it to schedule tree maintenance on a regular basis and keep accurate records of 
work performed, rather than just reacting to residents' complaints about 
unkempt limbs, maintenance manager Christian said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know exactly where the vacancies are now, so we can schedule planting and 
replacement projects," Christian said. "And we can pick out the faster-growing 
species . . . and trim the trees when they need trimming." 
</P>
<P>
Besides helping cities plan tree maintenance, the database could be useful if a 
resident complains or sues over a city-owned tree, according to Terry Nielsen, 
Riverside parks superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
In one recent case, the city was sued over an injury caused by a California 
pepper tree that broke in a storm. The plaintiff claimed that the tree had not 
been properly maintained, but computer records showed that it was in good shape 
at the time of the accident. "The judge ruled that it was an act of God and 
that we weren't negligent," Nielsen recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Coast project analyst Clay Martin was helping nature and technology 
interface one recent afternoon in Costa Mesa. Walking along Westminster Avenue, 
Martin quickly entered the address and species code for a Shamel ash in his 
portable computer, then measured the tree's diameter, estimated its height and 
noted its condition, and entered that information as well. Time elapsed: Less 
than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
"I can probably identify about 200 trees," said Martin, who received a master's 
degree in forestry from Texas A &amp; M. "I'm not the best, though -- there are 
some who can identify a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Golden Coast systems manager Robert Carroll says he expects the company's 
business to grow as cities realize that a tree-keeping record on index cards -- 
or none at all -- just won't do anymore. The company sends out a quarterly 
newsletter (The Link to Better Urban Forestry) to its clients; a recent issue 
included articles about an updated version of the company's "TreeKeeper" 
software and on the economic value of municipal trees. 
</P>
<P>
"People and trees have got along real well for a long time," Carroll said. 
"We're trying to add computers to automate things." 
</P>
<P>
While resident Santa Ana tree expert Jones welcomes the advent of the computer 
in his job, he has no plans to throw away his card files just yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to hang on to it until this thing really progresses on the computer 
. . . in a year or two," he said. "But I really think this is the way to go. . 
. . If I retire in five or six years, they won't be able to pick my brain, and 
this will really help the next guy to come along."

'LORD' OF THE FLIES FINDS INSIGHT WITH INSECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fruit Fly is a tiny brown creature with bulging polyhedral eyes. He doesn't 
like dirt. If a microscopic piece of mold clings to his back, a pair of bristly 
legs swivel around and push it off. 
</P>
<P>
There is a pristine simplicity to Fruit Fly, Edward Lewis says. The insect is 
clean, disease-free and, in its normal form, an exact replica of all of its 
relatives. "There isn't that crazy variability that you see in some creatures," 
the Caltech biology professor says. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 71, has been studying common fruit flies, mainstays of genetics 
laboratories, precisely because of that consistency in form, for more than 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A short, unassuming man with neatly clipped white hair, Lewis is one of perhaps 
100 microbiologists and geneticists around the world -- popularly known as the 
"Lords of the Flies" -- who have made Drosophila melanogaster their life's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Sound ridiculously esoteric? Hardly. The tiny flies, about an eighth of an inch 
long when they're fully developed, are providing answers to some of the big 
questions about organic development: How does a blip-like aggregation of cells 
develop into a complicated organism, with eyes, gonads, a nervous system and 
the rest? What can go wrong? What causes cancer or birth defects? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preeminent 'Lord' 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' little flies (you've seen them swarming around overripe bananas) have 
been providing the stuff with which to delve deep into the peculiar chemistry 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who is widely acknowledged as one of the preeminent "Lords," was 
recently elected to the Royal Society of London (Isaac Newton was an early 
president). His speculations 30 years ago about the existence of clusters of 
developmental genes, forming a kind of "command center" to direct other genes, 
helped set the agenda for recent genetics research, some of his colleagues say. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis usually speaks in the sober, measured tones befitting an internationally 
recognized scientist, with digressions about the "ultrabithorax gene" or the 
roentgens produced by background radiation. (A roentgen is a measurement of 
radiation named for the discoverer of X-rays, Wilhelm K. Roentgen.) Even his 
colleagues can stumble trying to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis can be downright rhapsodic when he talks about his flies. 
</P>
<P>
On the third floor of Caltech's Kerckhoff Hall is a refrigerated room, 
maintained at 68 degrees Fahrenheit, with shelves brimming with jars, like 
small milk bottles. There are about 8,000 of them in the "Cold Room," and they 
hold a revolving population of about 2 million flies. 
</P>
<P>
Drosophila is a perfect laboratory specimen, says Lewis. "They keep themselves 
scrupulously clean," he said. "They acquire no known diseases. All of your 
(fruit flies) can't get wiped out at once by some sickness. That's happened 
with mice, you know." 
</P>
<P>
Even more important for the geneticist is the flies' lack of individual 
differentiation. "There is a real 'normal animal,' " said Lewis. With more 
complicated laboratory specimens, individual differentiation makes it difficult 
to say what is really normal. The point is that geneticists and microbiologists 
learn about the normal by studying the abnormal. 
</P>
<P>
A weekly event in the basement of Kerckhoff Hall is the mutating of male flies 
with X-rays. About 30 of them at a time are etherized and packed into a 
gelatinous container, like a big vitamin capsule, and zapped with X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
"We give them a dose which would kill a human being outright," said Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
The resilient fruit flies' bodies come through almost unscathed. But their 
chromosomes, the coded genetic material that dictates the form of their 
offspring, are often disrupted by errant electrons. Chances are that the sons 
and daughters of those irradiated male flies (which are bred with virgin 
females) will be mutants. 
</P>
<P>
In the Cold Room, there are jars full of flies with legs growing out of their 
heads where antennae should be, eyes without pigment or extra sets of wings. 
These are the freaks that provide signposts to the essence of the normal. 
</P>
<P>
"What the geneticist has to do is use mutation to figure out the normal," said 
Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Techniques 
</P>
<P>
Comparing normal and abnormal specimens, Lewis and his post doctoral fellow Sue 
Celniker have mapped specific genes on oversized chromosomes from the flies' 
salivary glands. Using new chemical techniques, they have begun to identify the 
specific proteins that carry developmental messages to embryonic cells. 
</P>
<P>
The pristine simplicity of Fruit Fly has yielded some intriguingly simple 
truths about the development of an organism, Lewis says. 
</P>
<P>
"There are clusters of genes on the chromosomes lined up in the same order as 
the flies themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, if you could "read" particular clusters of genes strung out 
along a chromosome, they would spell out the body of Fruit Fly, in the sequence 
in which it normally develops: head, abdomen, thorax. After one segment 
develops in its embryonic state, the associated developmental cluster turns 
itself off (or switches modes) and flips on the next one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeated Developments 
</P>
<P>
Disrupt the process, however, as with an X-ray-induced mutation, and a peculiar 
thing happens. Development gets stuck in a particular mode. Thus, the wing 
segment, for example, repeats itself, giving Fruit Fly multiple sets of wings 
instead of the normal pair. 
</P>
<P>
The wider significance of the odd behavior of fly chromosomes is the possible 
link between cancer (in which cells replicate themselves irrationally) and 
genetic defects. "Cancer is really a return to the embryonic cell state," said 
Lewis, "with cells that aren't under master regulatory control." 
</P>
<P>
Other geneticists have actually isolated a cluster of cells that appear to 
serve as the developing organism's command center, turning developmental genes 
on and off at precisely the right moments. The same cluster, called the "homeo 
box" (from the Greek homeotic, meaning similar) has been found in fruit flies, 
frogs, mice and humans. 
</P>
<P>
An amazing discovery, says Lewis. "It shows (humans and lower life forms) have 
a common ancestor, going back more than 500 million years." Twenty-nine years 
ago Lewis predicted the eventual discovery of the master regulatory genes, 
which dictate the course of development from embryo to mature organism. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis compares the homeo box to a computer on a modern fighter plane, keeping 
the speeding machine stable and flying in a straight line. "The master control 
regulates all the parts," he said. "There's a core of information sitting 
there, like the genes in the homeo box." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Homeo Madness' 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, the homeo box has been the hottest thing in genetics. 
Its discovery has started a wave of "homeo madness," as one journal put it, 
with one scientist after another weighing in with new findings. 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure yet what happens when there are disruptions of the homeo box. 
"But there are all sorts of problems due to slight losses (in genetic 
material)," said Lewis, citing the recent discovery that cystic fibrosis occurs 
because of the absence of just three of 250,000 chemicals composing one human 
gene. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' obsession with Fruit Fly began when he was a teen-ager in Wilkes Barre, 
Pa. "There was an advertisement in Science magazine saying that you could buy 
fly cultures," he said. By the time he and a fellow student began growing their 
own flies in the high school biology lab, they had both read "The Biological 
Basis of Human Nature," by Herbert Spencer Jennings, and they were brimming 
with new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Why the passionate interest? "I think it was that you could, with a few 
symbols, express how things are inherited," said Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work of Predecessors 
</P>
<P>
He went to the University of Minnesota -- "It was a big university that didn't 
charge much money for out-of-state students" -- and got his doctorate from 
Caltech in 1942. He has been a fixture at the institute ever since, carrying on 
the Drosophila work of his predecessors at Caltech, Thomas Hunt Morgan and 
Alfred H. Sturtevant. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis retired from teaching last year. But he's not about to stop his research, 
he says. When he talks about recent developments in genetics, there's still a 
whiff of youthful enthusiasm, reminiscent of the high school student from 
Pennsylvania. "Amazing," he says frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Someone wrote that the newly discovered developmental genes that Lewis and 
colleagues are studying represent the Rosetta Stone of organic development. 
True? "A nice expression," Lewis said cautiously, switching from artist to 
scientist. "It sort of gives you the idea."

WALL OF NAYSAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It should cause little wonder that Sacramento balked at the Oceanside Community 
Development Department's proposal for using migrant housing funds 
("Restrictions Keep Migrant Housing in Limbo," Sept. 4). As originally 
conceived, that proposal was virtually a "grower giveaway." City Housing 
Director Richard Goodman, who loudly decries everyone else's naivete, is 
seemingly oblivious of the very sad history of privately run farm-labor camps 
in this county. Almost without exception, those camps are badly substandard and 
badly overcrowded. Not infrequently, workers are overcharged -- if not gouged. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Mr. Goodman apparently rejects the fact that such arrangements are 
fraught with potential for exploitation. Time and again, we have encountered 
farm-worker families afraid to complain about even serious habitability 
problems (for example, raw sewage seepage outside their front doors) because 
they stand to lose not only roofs over their heads but their livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, they are all too often reluctant to complain about labor abuses 
(for example, failure to pay minimum wage) because retaliation is likely to 
take the form of discharge and eviction. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Bill 617, as amended, does allow for mobile homes on grower 
owned/leased land, and for single men. However, it does not compromise the need 
to ensure that farm-worker housing underwritten with taxpayers' funds is safe, 
decent and affordable, and that applicant families aren't discriminated 
against. 
</P>
<P>
Neither does it compromise the need to ensure that the landlord-tenant 
relationship is not characterized by intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural employers do have a significant role to play in efforts to shelter 
their workers, but Oceanside should consider providing other incentives for 
agribusiness to house its workers, such as permit fee waivers. 
</P>
<P>
The almost solid wall of naysayers encountered in this county is unprecedented 
in our long (nearly 25 years) and wide (from El Centro to Marysville) 
experience trying to promote the development of farm-worker housing. 
</P>
<P>
First, housing officials from the county on down said that San Diego was not 
sufficiently agricultural to be considered favorably by federal and state 
farm-worker housing programs. That straw man was knocked down, but now the 
inability to find even scattered, publicly owned sites has been interposed. 
</P>
<P>
Would that the energy expended on finding 10 reasons why such shelter can't be 
provided here were used to devise five ways of "making it happen" -- as it has 
in 14 other farm counties. If farm-worker housing can be provided in Palm 
Springs (on city-donated land), surely it could in, say, the San Pasqual Valley 
(90% owned by the city of San Diego) or Fallbrook (a hard-core agricultural 
area).

BRAVO FOR JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo to L.A. Judge Tashima for holding Operation Rescue terrorists in contempt 
of court, and for fining them $111,000 for illegally blockading clinics 
("Abortion Protesters Fined, Held in Contempt by Judge," Aug. 30). 
</P>
<P>
He has sent a clear message to those who would disregard laws, special 
injunctions, and the rights of others and then expect special treatment. San 
Diego judges should continue to act in a similar manner against local 
blockaders. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego woman who testified about her April 29 experience of having a 
miscarriage sat in my car for over an hour while anti-choice Operation Rescue 
demonstrators blocked her access to her doctor. She wasn't having an abortion 
-- she was bleeding and fighting for her life. 
</P>
<P>
Herein lies the hypocrisy of the anti-choice movement's tactics of blockading 
clinics. They threaten the lives of patients not going to have abortions, as 
well as those women who have made a decision to legally end their pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
In America, no group has the right to harass and terrify innocent people 
engaged in legal activities. If these anti-abortion zealots want to live in a 
religious dictatorship, they should leave the U. S. immediately.

PROBLEMS OF GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Tom Gorman's story on the school shortage ("Students, Students 
Everywhere and Nary a Place to Sit," Sept. 5). 
</P>
<P>
Amen, Amen and Amen again -- there are not enough schools available for all the 
new homes being built in San Diego. Builders march merrily over hill and dale, 
constructing houses cheek-by-jowl, selling them for astronomical sums, and 
leaving behind shortages not only of schools, but of libraries, parks and other 
public amenities, not to mention increases in traffic on our already distressed 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Prevent Los Angelization Now, a group (formerly known as Citizens for 
Limited Growth) which is sponsoring an initiative to ensure that new 
development pays for itself. 
</P>
<P>
PLAN! stands for more than merely growth management. One of our aims is to 
focus the efforts of many disparate groups who see the deterioration of their 
neighborhoods, the raping of the environment and the lack of concern for 
current residents which growth impinges upon their quality of life. Unpaid-for 
development costs current residents not only peace and contentment, but money. 
</P>
<P>
However, any such ordinance requires understanding by all San Diegans. It needs 
to be discussed, argued, modified and accepted by a majority if it is to 
achieve its goals. PLAN! wishes to join with other community organizations in a 
grass-roots effort to solve these problems and others.

ROSECRANS CORRIDOR VICE SPURS ANNEXATION PLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the height of the dinner hour, it is eerily still inside the restaurant on 
Western Avenue near Rosecrans Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Each table is meticulously set: Place mats, paper napkins and silverware are 
precisely in place. Cardboard placards advertise dinner specials. Menus are at 
the ready. 
</P>
<P>
But not a customer is in sight. Until closing, at around 11 p.m., not one 
patron walks in for a sit-down dinner, although a few stop by to pick up orders 
or phone them in for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, at the brightly lit bars and motels nearby, the parking lots are full 
and the ebb and flow of customers continues until the early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the restaurant, who asked that his name not be used, says 
prostitution in the neighborhood is driving his customers away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not good for business," he said. "Sometimes customers come in, they see 
the girls and they leave. They never come back." 
</P>
<P>
Other merchants in the area, especially those whose businesses are open only 
during the day, say they have reached a peaceful but uneasy coexistence with 
the activities on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, many report that prostitutes sometimes aggressively proposition 
customers attempting to enter the small shops along the street, said Gardena 
Police Lt. Gary Cherry. The prostitution problem on Western Avenue is centered 
around an area known as the Rosecrans Corridor, a jagged, milelong finger of 
unincorporated county land that extends along Rosecrans Avenue into the city of 
Gardena, from Crenshaw Boulevard to just east of Western. 
</P>
<P>
One merchant, who requested anonymity, said he has survived by building a loyal 
clientele that has kept his business afloat for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
'We get along in this neighborhood," he said. "(Prostitution) is a part of life 
here." 
</P>
<P>
But law enforcement officials hope to curtail it. 
</P>
<P>
The Gardena Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
separately conducted raids on Western Avenue during a single week in August, 
making a combined total of 125 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
In an Aug. 19 sweep by the Sheriff's Department, 59 men were arrested and 
charged with soliciting, two women were arrested on prostitution charges, and a 
man and woman were charged with interfering with police operations, said Lt. 
Dennis Slocumb. The sheriff's sweep was conducted around 146th Street and 
Western Avenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Five days later, on Aug. 24, Gardena police conducted a sweep at 148th Street 
and Western. Sixty-two men were arrested and charged with soliciting 
prostitution, said Gardena Sgt. Robert Watts. In a separate sweep on Vermont 
Avenue on Aug. 25, Gardena police arrested 21 more men who were charged with 
soliciting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In both the police and sheriff's operations, undercover female officers posing 
as prostitutes stood along Western Avenue, where potential customers driving by 
pulled over to the curb to solicit sex, law enforcement officials said. The men 
were later cited on suspicion of soliciting prostitution, booked and released. 
</P>
<P>
Both stings began during broad daylight, around noon, police and sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the number of prostitutes on the street has decreased somewhat, 
said merchants whose complaints helped trigger the sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
Still, law enforcement officials and business owners predict that the lull will 
be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen them take women and drug dealers off the street, but they come right 
back," said a longtime merchant who asked to be identified only as Brian. "You 
turn into a cynic." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Kitahama, whose family has owned the Wayside Nursery near Rosecrans 
Avenue since 1934, said police efforts have helped to lessen the problem in 
recent years, but he is pessimistic that it will be eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what they do, they'll never get rid of it," said Kitahama, whose 
nursery falls within Gardena city limits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Losing Battle' 
</P>
<P>
Gardena Sgt. Watts concurs. "The problem is, in my opinion, it's a losing 
battle," Watts said. "It doesn't have a long-term effect, primarily because 
there are a whole lot of customers out there." 
</P>
<P>
Geography also plays a part in Western Avenue's prostitution problem, according 
to city officials, police and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
Some business owners in the unincorporated county area complained that they 
rarely see sheriff's deputies on patrol. In addition, some said, response to 
emergencies might be swifter from the Gardena police, headquartered at the 
Gardena Civic Center less than two miles away, than from the Lennox Sheriff's 
Station, about four miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ron Herbst of the Lennox Sheriff's Station said at least one car patrols 
the unincorporated county area west of Gardena, including the Rosecrans 
Corridor, in the early morning hours. During the evenings, two or three cars 
patrol the area, he said. In addition, there may be unmarked vice or gang-unit 
cars in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, unless there's a specific call, it may appear no one's around," 
Herbst said. "But they're definitely there, and they're busy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Annexation Sought 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Gardena city officials submitted an application to the Local 
Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to annex the 198-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report prepared last year by city officials, about 1,700 people 
live in the area, which is 32.6% residential, 21% industrial, 18.6% commercial, 
and the rest a mix of public property and other uses. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Kenneth Landau said the city is negotiating over the transfer of 
property tax revenues from the county to the city. Those negotiations should be 
complete in 60 to 90 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the City Council must approve a resolution of the property tax transfer 
agreement with the county, according to the city's report. If approved, the 
annexation proposal will go before LAFCO for a public hearing. If LAFCO 
approves and fewer than 25% of property owners in the unincorporated area 
oppose the annexation, the proposal will return to the City Council for another 
public hearing. If there is still no public opposition and if the council then 
approves it, the annexation would go into effect the following day. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have argued that annexation would give residents better fire and 
police protection and increased access to local government because they could 
take complaints to nearby Gardena City Hall rather than to the Board of 
Supervisors in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants hope that if the annexation goes through, Gardena police will 
step up patrols and prostitution will decrease even further. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that would help us is if the Gardena Police Department would 
take over this area," one merchant said. "That'd be nice."

THERE'LL BE TROUBLE AT HAWTHORNE HIGH, POOL HALL FOES CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Battle lines have been drawn between the Centinela Valley Union High School 
District and a developer who plans to build the nation's largest 24-hour pool 
hall next to Hawthorne High School. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Jerry Jamgotchian, president of Equity West Development of 
Torrance, has the permits needed to open a pool hall in a vacant building in 
the 5100 block of El Segundo Boulevard. But now, Jamgotchian is seeking a 
liquor license, and some school officials and residents say that spells trouble 
with a capital T. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bad Influence Feared 
</P>
<P>
They say the sale of liquor at the pool hall will promote gambling, loitering, 
gangs and the sale of liquor to minors. 
</P>
<P>
"I oppose the whole situation," board member Ann Birdsall said. "We just don't 
want it there to be tempting for a child." 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. McKinley M. Nash said: "I personally feel it is (going to 
establish) an undesirable educational climate." 
</P>
<P>
Jamgotchian defends his project, saying the 25,000-square-foot pool hall will 
be well-maintained, will attract only upscale young professionals and will not 
affect the nearby school. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told them maybe 600 times that I have no interest in serving minors," 
Jamgotchian said. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5-million pool hall -- the owner prefers the term billiard center -- 
will include 56 pool tables, a bar, several large-screen televisions and a food 
court with five food booths, he said. Remodeling will begin in three weeks, and 
the opening of the pool hall is scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
"I have too much invested for there to be any problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the National Pocket Billiard Assn. in Milwaukee, 
Jamgotchian's pool hall would be the largest in the country. The 
second-largest, with 50 billiard tables, is in Florida, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jamgotchian went before the city Planning Commission in July to request a 
permit to sell liquor, which was met with vehement opposition from residents 
and representatives of the school district and a local church. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted unanimously to reject his request. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Jamgotchian has sought to appease his opponents by offering to make 
the pool hall a private club for members only. He has also told the school 
board that he will limit the hours liquor is served and has offered to give the 
school board the right to revoke his liquor permit if the pool hall is found 
serving liquor to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jim Mitsch, Hawthorne's director of general services, said that 
regardless of Jamgotchian's offer, only the city has the right to revoke a 
liquor permit. 
</P>
<P>
Jamgotchian has also offered the district a one-time "impact fee" of $250,000, 
which he suggested could be used for teachers' salaries or the purchase of new 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreed to Reconsider 
</P>
<P>
In light of these new conditions, Planning Director Michael Goodson said the 
Planning Commission has agreed to reconsider Jamgotchian's request for a liquor 
permit. The hearing will be held within the next four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
If Jamgotchian receives a permit he can apply for a liquor license with the 
state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, Goodson said. 
</P>
<P>
Jamgotchian said that if he gets a liquor license, the pool hall will be open 
only to customers 21 and older. If he does not get a license, he said that he 
will open the food court area to all ages but that the pool table area would be 
off limits to those under 21. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jamgotchian's peace offerings have been rejected by many opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is going to be anyone in the community that would approve 
of a pool hall sitting right next to the high school," board President Aleta 
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said she was insulted by Jamgotchian's offer of $250,000. "No way would 
we take $250,000 or any amount of money to allow this to happen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called a Bribe 
</P>
<P>
Birdsall agreed and called the $250,000 offer a bribe. "You can't put a figure 
of money on a child's life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jamgotchian said the money is intended to help the district improve its 
educational programs and insists that it is not a bribe. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Earl Thornton of the Delaire Assembly of God Church in Hawthorne said 
he opposes the sale of liquor at the pool hall. "Those types of establishments 
attract the less-than-best type of people," Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also fears that when the pool hall opens, students from the high 
school will skip class to loiter there. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jamgotchian said he will enforce strict dress and behavior codes to 
prohibit loitering, Stennis Floyd, a longtime resident whose son graduated from 
Hawthorne High School last year, said the pool hall will be a "drug haven" for 
gangs and prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need a pool hall in Hawthorne," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd said he thinks the young professionals Jamgotchian intends to attract 
will not drive into Hawthorne to play pool. 
</P>
<P>
"The yuppies won't come here," he said. "Why doesn't he take his idea to 
Hermosa Beach where the yuppies live?" 
</P>
<P>
Jamgotchian, who owns a 6,000-square-foot pool hall in Montclair, said pool 
halls are becoming very popular on the East Coast and said he is trying to 
encourage a similar trend here. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on the leading edge and that is why I'm taking all the flak," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Clark, director of community development in Montclair, said he has heard 
of no complaints involving Jamgotchian's pool hall in that city. 
</P>
<P>
Jamgotchian said there are thousands of pool players in the South Bay but very 
few places to play. Jamgotchian said he thinks his pool hall in Hawthorne will 
attract customers from as far north as Marina del Rey and as far south as Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He said the customers at his pool hall will "not be there to gamble, they are 
just going to try to improve their skills." 
</P>
<P>
Although residents and school officials have said they will continue to oppose 
his request for a liquor permit, Jamgotchian said he is not concerned. He said 
that once the pool hall begins operating, his opponents will realize that their 
fears were unfounded and will reconsider their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the place is built and operating they will be convinced there is no 
problem," he said.

STATE WON'T ALLOW VOTE ON SPLIT DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
EASTSIDERS DENIED CHANCE TO BREAK UP PALOS VERDES SCHOOLS 
</P>

Palos Verdes school board members Jeffrey Younggren and Jack Bagdasar shared a 
jubilant victory hug Friday after the State Board of Education announced its 
long-awaited decision: Voters on the east side of the school district will not 
be allowed to decide if they want to secede. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after the board's 6-3 vote, an elated Younggren declared that the 
action ends "two years of warfare" with a parents group that has sought to 
split the Palos Verdes Peninsula School District since 1987, when the local 
board proposed closing Miraleste High School. 
</P>
<P>
Younggren said the district can make plans to close the school as soon as the 
district issues a court-ordered environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to vote and go ahead," said Younggren, president of the board. 
"The environmental impact report is coming soon. As soon as we have that we'll 
(prepare to) close the school next fall." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Friday's action, the bitter dispute seems far from settled as both 
sides gear up for new skirmishes. 
</P>
<P>
"It really doesn't bring the matter to an end," said Ted Gibbs, a spokesman for 
the parents group, the East Peninsula Education Council. "It brings this 
portion of the matter to an end." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs said his group could petition the state board for a new hearing once the 
Palos Verdes school board completes the court-ordered environmental review of 
the proposed Miraleste closure and past school closings throughout the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs said he would have preferred that the state board postpone any action 
until after the November election. Three former EPEC leaders are among seven 
candidates running for three seats. 
</P>
<P>
One of those candidates, Peter Gardiner, said in an interview that the state 
panel's action makes the election "that much more important." He conceded that 
if he and the other two former leaders of the group who are running are 
perceived by voters as one-issue candidates interested primarily in keeping 
Miraleste open, it will be tough for them to win as a slate. 
</P>
<P>
Although all three have said they would not favor splitting the district if 
elected, they would vote to keep Miraleste open and to shake up the district's 
present management, including firing Supt. Jack Price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
East Side Voters Outnumbered 
</P>
<P>
Only about 25% of the peninsula's voters live on the east side, a factor that 
could work against the three candidates. Only 15% to 20% of the people residing 
on the peninsula have school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District encompasses Rolling Hills, 
Rolling Hills Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes and Palos Verdes Estates. Enrollment 
has declined from a peak of 17,742 students to about 9,300. As a result, the 
district in recent years has closed seven schools and has sold six parcels of 
land that had been earmarked for future school construction. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed eastern district would have included 1,700 students from Rolling 
Hills, the eastern side of Rancho Palos Verdes and a portion of Rolling Hills 
Estates. 
</P>
<P>
According to a staff report to the state board in July, the proposed district 
"would not significantly disrupt the quality of education being provided to the 
children in either school district." 
</P>
<P>
But a majority of the state board, which had delayed action on the issue 
earlier this year and failed to reach a final decision in July, viewed the 
secession in a different light. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, board member Kenneth Peters said that if the panel had delayed 
the decision again, "all we would do is keep the pot boiling even more so." 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the proposed new district could not conduct "a comprehensive 
program that all secondary students need." Peters, former superintendent of the 
Beverly Hills schools, also said he needed to have a compelling reason to break 
up the existing Palos Verdes district. 
</P>
<P>
Also siding with the majority was the board's student member, Paras Mehta, a 
senior at Cerritos High School, who recently joined the panel. Both sides had 
suggested that Mehta was a swing vote on the board, but Mehta said he rejected 
the election petition because breaking up the district "could impact 
educational programs." 
</P>
<P>
Several state board members said they had received a letter from Assemblyman 
Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) asking them to delay action until January. 
Felando could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph D. Carrabino, a board member from Encino, said he favored putting off 
the vote until after the election because he didn't want to influence the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
EPEC spokesman Gibbs said he believes that, no matter what the result of the 
election, "we should maintain K-12 education on the east side of the hill." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs asserted that the Palos Verdes district, by closing east side schools, 
has "created a de facto west side school district which in a sense isolates and 
ignores the rights and needs of a substantial portion of the community." 
</P>
<P>
But Younggren expressed the hope that the state board action will put a halt to 
"this nonsense" and allow the Palos Verdes officials to focus on the 
educational needs of their students. 
</P>
<P>
He said after Miraleste is closed as a high school, he would support converting 
it into an intermediate school and community center. He said he would not 
support the sale of the Miraleste property. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he asserted, the east side dissidents "will have a lot of what 
they're asking for. They won't have everything, but I don't have everything."

OWNING ONE'S HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This past week there have been two excellent articles regarding families trying 
to protect themselves from problems our society has bestowed upon us. 
</P>
<P>
One was on the lady in Long Beach who has been reduced to sleeping on a vacant 
lot and sifting through the rubble to find her keepsakes because her home of 
many years was bulldozed by the city because it didn't meet the neighborhood 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
The other article reported on the family in Fountain Valley with eight children 
who built a safe batting cage in their own yard so their children would have a 
safe place to practice baseball, and not have their equipment going into the 
road, or worse, into the neighbor's window. A petition was presented stating 35 
neighbors were for the practice area and six were against it so it must be torn 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Both of these families are homeowners. Just what does that mean? You get the 
privilege of paying taxes, insurance, being responsible for all the upkeep, and 
still don't have the freedom to enjoy your own property that you have worked so 
hard to own? 
</P>
<P>
It's a sad day when a handful of "do-gooders" who are afraid their image might 
be injured can govern our every effort to live in and realize the freedom that 
is supposed to have been bestowed on all the people in this country.

PROVIDING LAND FOR CHURCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(Mandatory) church zoning? What will be proposed next, requirements to mandate 
the construction of government buildings by developers? The whole concept is 
ridiculous and deserves little consideration. 
</P>
<P>
There are far more pressing issues that affect people's lives in Orange County 
that should be addressed by churches and local government. For example, 
affordable housing is still a dream for many families who must pay high rents, 
live in substandard conditions, or commute to their jobs from Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties. Local developers, with few exceptions, have not had to 
provide housing for low-income families in this county -- that responsibility 
has been passed on to the government. 
</P>
<P>
The free exercise of religion does not mean that we must provide land for new 
churches with spacious meetings rooms, offices, and kitchens. Worship can take 
place anywhere. Further, it is unreasonable to expect others to subsidize the 
cost of the church land. Certainly, the developer is not going to absorb the 
expense of valuable property in Orange County. It will be passed on to home 
buyers who already pay inflated prices. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, there are other more immediate land-use concerns. Churches and local 
government should spend more time and effort on alleviating human suffering and 
less on trying to build the grandest religious palace to attract the largest 
congregation.

CAR-POOL LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First-day results of the car-pool lane on the 405 (San Diego Freeway) showed 
significant improvement in all lanes. Caltrans expresses "amazement" and 
"excitement" at the results and offers this as further proof that the car-pool 
lanes really do work. Our perspective on this is a lot different. 
</P>
<P>
Of course adding a lane to the freeway improves things. Even if it's a car-pool 
lane. But this has nothing to do with car-pool lane effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of all the excitement, (it) seems like everyone has neglected to 
ask the real question, which should be: 
</P>
<P>
"How much better (or worse) is the freeway as a whole working now, as compared 
to what it would if that new pavement were operated as a mixed-flow lane?" 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans doesn't want that question asked nor answered. That's why they have 
vowed, since the disastrous Santa Monica Diamond lane experience, "Never again 
to take a lane away from the people" (that is, never again to permit a direct 
test of the car-pool lane vs. mixed-flow alternatives). Rather, they smuggle 
the car-pool lane in as a new lane and then in a burst of publicity, attribute 
the inevitable improvement to the car-pool lane operation. 
</P>
<P>
But on the 405, the car-pool lane takes between two and three normal lane 
widths of pavement. If that pavement were used for mixed-flow, it would provide 
at least a two-lane increase of capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The perception of car-pool lane effectiveness is a delusion based on 
superficial analysis, wishful thinking, and misleading hype.

COUNTY TO HOLD WORKSHOPS ON REVISED PLAN FOR LENNOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When county planning officials presented their ideas for a revitalization plan 
for Lennox in April, hundreds of residents packed into a public hearing and 
accused the county of attempting to wipe out housing and turn the 
unincorporated area east of Los Angeles International Airport into a commercial 
wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
County officials are now working on a revised plan, and a series of workshops 
is being held to gain public comment before a draft is released. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Thursday night, members of the Lennox Coordinating Council 
discussed proposals that their community group plans to make to county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Proposals 
</P>
<P>
Harry Lenczyk said proposals from the group may include invigorating the 
struggling business districts along Hawthorne Boulevard, Inglewood Avenue and 
Lennox Boulevard; renovating run-down areas under the airport's flight path, 
and even turning Inglewood Avenue, a main thoroughfare that residents say is 
overrun by drug dealers, into two one-way streets with houses in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're through, Lennox will be one of the nicest areas around," Lenczyk 
said. "That is the goal of the future." 
</P>
<P>
The county workshops, which began Saturday, will continue Wednesday at 3 p.m. 
at Jefferson School, Sept. 18 at 5 p.m. at Whelan School and Sept. 23 at noon 
at Lennox Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
After a draft plan is produced in the coming months, it must win approval from 
the Regional Planning Commission and the county Board of Supervisors before it 
becomes the official policy guideline for Lennox's future, said Sorin 
Alexanian, a county planning official. 
</P>
<P>
"We are starting from scratch," Alexanian said. "We have nothing set in 
concrete. All we have are ideas, some broad general goals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County's Proposals 
</P>
<P>
Alexanian said the county's proposals will include renovating businesses along 
Inglewood Avenue, stabilizing the area's residential character, and creating a 
commercial district and high-density area where apartments would be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The first county proposal outlined a $121-million effort to convert some 
residential areas under LAX flight paths to light industrial and commercial 
use; construct replacement housing and schools for residents displaced as a 
result; soundproof homes, and make other physical improvements such as 
expanding parks and widening streets. 
</P>
<P>
Residents complained that the plan was an attempt by the county to move 
industry in and people out to take advantage of the area's proximity to the 
airport.

CABRILLO BRIDGE CLOSED TO VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Balboa Park's Cabrillo Bridge will be closed to traffic until Oct. 15 while 
work is done on two bridge projects. As a result, access to the park will be 
limited to Park Boulevard and Presidents Way on the park's eastern side. 
</P>
<P>
The park's entrance at Balboa Drive and El Prado is undergoing a $150,000 face 
lift that will include repaving and landscaping improvements, according to Gary 
Stromberg, district manager of Balboa Park for the city's Park and Recreation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Interlocking brick-and-dirt beds will be added to the bridge's western side, 
Stromberg said. San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank is paying for the project as 
part of its 100th anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, storm drain reconstruction on the bridge's eastern side will 
be funded by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Construction work at both ends is expected to be completed before Oct. 15, 
Stromberg said.

FERGUSON RESOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) showed his ugly racist 
character by vehemently objecting to "a resolution calling for California 
schoolchildren to be taught that the Japanese internment during World War II 
was a violation of human rights. . . ." (The Times, Aug. 25). Ferguson is a 
self-styled anti-communist, yet he finds comfort in emulating Soviet Russia's 
rewriting of history to eliminate unsavory events. A veteran of three wars, 
Ferguson asked the 80-member Assembly for "one-week postponement so he could 
rally veterans groups against the resolution." 
</P>
<P>
As a veteran, I urge my fellow veterans to ask Ferguson, in turn, why it is Tom 
Hayden, whom he wants ousted from the Assembly, and not him, who is fighting 
for the welfare of the veterans as shown by Hayden's bill signed by the 
governor in 1984 to aid victims of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans groups should stop supporting Ferguson's contemptible ideas -- 
this time, to lie outright to our children and future generations about 
history.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THE SEARCH GOES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've been reading with interest about the scandals at the Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) Department, and about local communities that are taking 
initiatives to provide decent housing for low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
Mismanagement aside, the federal government and HUD have clearly contributed to 
the affordable housing crisis. The federal housing budget was substantially 
reduced from $32 billion in 1980 to under $8 billion in 1988. There was (not 
surprisingly) a corresponding decrease in the number of new families assisted 
by HUD, from 316,000 families a year during 1977-1980 to 82,000 families during 
1981-1988. 
</P>
<P>
A large crisis looms as (we run out of) federally subsidized low-income 
housing: 800,000 HUD subsidized units, built 20 years ago, can be sold by their 
developers in 1990; 5,000 units are in Orange County. Rental subsidies, under 
Section 8, expire on another 465,000 rental units (nationwide). 
</P>
<P>
This translates into 1,265,000 families who have no place else to go. There are 
currently twice as many renters as there are affordable places to live. Half of 
those people with incomes under the poverty level already pay more than 70% of 
their income on housing. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder that people are planning to march on Washington, D.C., this Oct. 
7 to demand housing now! Funding must be restored to provide permanent 
affordable housing for low-income families. This will match the goal set by 
Congress 40 years ago to provide "a decent home in a suitable living 
environment" for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
If HUD cannot administer the funds properly, then I say let's give the funds to 
those communities that have demonstrated successful local initiatives to 
provide affordable housing solutions.

LA JOLLAN INDICTED IN METH LAB CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unemployed 45-year-old La Jolla man has been indicted in U.S. District Court 
in San Diego on charges that he ran a methamphetamine lab in his home and sold 
the drug to an undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
After selling a quarter-pound of methamphetamine to an undercover agent Aug. 
25, John Louis Blonski was arrested Aug. 29 in Pacific Beach after trying to 
sell a half-pound of the drug to the same agent, Assistant U.S. Atty. Amalia L. 
Meza said. 
</P>
<P>
After Blonski's arrest, police searched his La Jolla house and discovered a 
disassembled methamphetamine lab, Meza said. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-count indictment charges Blonski with making and distributing 
methamphetamine and using a telephone to commit a drug offense. 
</P>
<P>
Conviction could mean life in federal prison, Meza said, adding that Blonski is 
due to be arraigned Tuesday before federal Magistrate Roger C. McKee.

<TEXT>
<P>
A dump in Gypsum Canyon would cover 500 acres, or one-half, of Orange County's 
rare Tecate cypress forest. Plans shown on county conceptual landfill maps 
would cause Tecate cypress to diminish by a significant amount as a species. 
</P>
<P>
Additional rare plants and animals, some of them candidates for federal 
endangered-species listing, would also dwindle considerably if this plan were 
put into effect.

If the Orange County supervisors are serious about preserving the Tecate 
cypress forest, they will reject the proposed Gypsum Canyon landfill in its 
entirety.

LENDL ELIMINATES AGASSI, WILL FACE BECKER IN FINAL

Perennial finalist Ivan Lendl joined Boris Becker in the championship round of 
the U.S. Open Saturday, defeating Andre Agassi, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1, 3-6, 6-1, and 
tying a tournament record held by the Bill Tilden. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Lendl plays in his eighth consecutive Open final, matching the mark 
Tilden established from 1918-25. He goes for his fourth crown against Becker, 
the first German in more than half a century to play for the U.S. men's 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Lendl struggled early against Agassi, trailing in the first set 
and battling back to force a tiebreaker, which he won, 7-4. The set took 1 hour 
15 minutes as both players stayed at the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi went quickly in the second set, but won the third before Lendl put him 
away in the fourth, setting up the match with Becker for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl has a 7-6 career edge over Becker, but has lost their last three 
meetings, including the semifinals at Wimbledon in July when the German was on 
the way to his third All-England title. 
</P>
<P>
Becker reached the final by beating Aaron Krickstein, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4, and then 
decided that he has finally figured out the puzzle of the Open, where his 
grass-court success at Wimbledon has never counted for much on the punishing 
hard courts of Flushing Meadow. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned my lesson here," Becker said after advancing to the final. "You 
almost have to love it here. You have to forget the distractions here: the 
planes, the heat, the noise of the spectators. It's difficult to play, but you 
just have to go out and have fun, like (Jimmy) Connors has done for the past 18 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Fun for Becker was becoming the first German since 1937 to reach the men's 
final here. The only other time that happened, Baron Gottfried von Cramm lost 
the U.S. National championship to Don Budge. The Nationals changed to the Open 
in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his success at Wimbledon, Becker had never made it to the final of any 
other Grand Slam event until Saturday. "This is definitely a big moment for 
me," he said. "I guess that's why the match was difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Becker seemed headed out of this tournament early when he twice faced match 
points against unseeded Derrick Rostagno in the second round. But he survived 
that crisis and has cruised since then, winning each of his last two matches in 
straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein came in with a reputation for doing well in longer matches. He had a 
17-7 career record in five-set matches, including a 7-1 log for them at the 
Open. So his strategy was to stretch Becker out. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel I hit the ball badly," Krickstein said. "I feel I missed some 
key shots. If I had won one of those early sets, we could have had a 3 1/2- 
(or) four-hour match and anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
With courtside temperatures near 100 degrees, Becker was hardly in the comfort 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
"The heat was the most difficult thing," he said. "It was probably the hottest 
I've ever played in. That's why I didn't attack as much. It's easier from the 
baseline. To rush all the time can be exhausting." 
</P>
<P>
So he stayed back and eventually won the battle of attrition, maintaining his 
record of never having dropped a set in four career meetings with Krickstein.

RBV STICKS TO BASICS, BEATS MORSE, 35-20,

<TEXT>
<P>
Let it be recorded that the first offensive play Rancho Buena Vista High School 
executed to begin its first San Diego Section 3-A football game was a pass. 
</P>
<P>
Hey. When you're the defending section 2-A champion, and you've been upgraded 
to 3-A status, and when you're opening against the defending section 3-A 
champion, you put in a few new wrinkles. Especially when you're opening against 
the defending 3-A champion. Right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
That was the last pass RBV threw. The Longhorns picked up their dominating 
rushing game right where they left it off in 1988, and it was every bit as 
impressive. By the time it was finished, RBV had produced a 35-20 victory and 
left quite an impression on Morse. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a good football team," Morse Coach John Shacklett said. "Our defense 
just got overpowered, especially the outside kids. They hit the off-tackle so 
strongly." 
</P>
<P>
RBV collected 442 yards on 50 rushes. Junior Markeith Ross ran 24 times for 247 
yards. Senior O.J. Hall didn't have a bad night either, adding 117 yards on 22 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied at halftime, 14-14, but RBV wore down Morse in the second 
half. The Longhorns scored three touchdowns on four possessions after halftime, 
Ross going in on 32- and 74-yard runs, and Hall scoring from the one. 
</P>
<P>
The longer the second half went, the more dominant RBV became. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just what we try to do," Coach Craig Bell said. "We're not arrogant, 
but we believe that conditioning and attitude eventually pay off." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was RBV's 15th in a row, moving it to fifth on the all-time section 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Still Bell, who has 12 starters returning, played it down. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're trying to mesh a team together, any win is a big win -- whether 
it's over Morse or Julian," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Morse, meanwhile, opened two weeks ago, losing to St. Louis of Hawaii, 24-17. 
The Tigers, too, have 12 starters returning and are trying to find their 
identity. Quarterback Teddy Lawrence passed for three touchdowns, all to David 
Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
But two of those came in the first half. Morse scored just once in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence completed six of 11 passes for 157 yards. But he attempted just three 
passes in the second half, completing it to Dunn for an eight-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to win the game, but I have to get the offense going," Shacklett 
said, explaining why Morse didn't throw more in the second half. "In Hawaii, we 
couldn't get (Jessie Campbell) into the game. So we put the option in last 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Morse used the option plenty. Campbell, a senior who rushed for more than 1,000 
yards last year, gained 66 yards on 14 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Morse scored both of its first-half touchdowns on passes, and Rancho Buena 
Vista scored twice on the ground. But one of RBV's scores came on a double 
reverse. 
</P>
<P>
Morse struck first, on its eighth offensive play (second possession). Lawrence 
passed 54 yards to Dunn with 6:38 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
RBV answered on its next possession, going 75 yards in nine plays. James Lewis 
took the ball in from the 43 on a double reverse, taking the handoff from 
running back Markeith Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later -- on the first play of the second quarter -- Morse regained 
the lead. Lawrence found Dunn again, this time from 32 yards out after faking a 
handoff up the middle to fullback Ututofo Fiame. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho tied the game with 5:03 left before halftime when Hall plunged up the 
middle from the one.

EVERT FACES FACTS, SEES THAT HER TIME HAS COME 
</P>

<P>
The stadium court crowd was standing and applauding her for what she had been, 
not for what she was Tuesday. Ted Williams hit a home run in his last at-bat. 
Chris Evert grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
Her No. 4 world ranking doesn't begin to show how the thing that made Evert 
great -- her intensity -- had plummeted. That she called Sunday's 6-0, 6-2 
victory over 15-year-old Monica Seles one of the two greatest of her U.S. Open 
career speaks volumes about Evert's lost lust for victory. 
</P>
<P>
The day that six-time Open champion Evert no longer expects to win tournaments 
and is thrilled to beat a 99-pound, 15-year-old is the day she should retire. 
</P>
<P>
And nobody knows it better than Evert. Which is why she decided this summer 
that this, her 19th Open, would be her last, and the end of her Grand Slam 
career. Which is why when Evert, serving for the first set, blew a 5-2 lead to 
Zina Garrison Tuesday and left the Open stage forever after an uninspired 7-6 
(7-1), 6-2 quarterfinal defeat, nobody was less surprised than she. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the reasons I'm retiring," a red-eyed Evert said. "I squandered 
that lead. I shouldn't have let it get away. I played a great match the other 
day, and I was kind of flat today. That's how it's been all year." 
</P>
<P>
It's been the first year of Evert's career in which she realized she was past 
her prime. By all accounts, she is happy in her marriage to former U.S. Olympic 
skier Andy Mill. They have a 6,000-square foot house outside of Aspen, Colo., 
that she truly longs to live in. She will be 35 in December. Her priorities 
have drastically changed. 
</P>
<P>
And as they have, her legendary intensity has vanished. Never a great athlete 
but always one of sports' fiercest competitors, Evert began losing to women -- 
and girls -- who never could have beaten her former ultra-intense self. Evert 
pulled out of this year's French Open, a tournament she'd won seven times, 
after losing at Geneva to Barbara Paulus. She watched it on TV in Florida. Did 
she yearn to be in Paris? No way. 
</P>
<P>
She yearned to make a big splash in her Open farewell. She had made the Open 
semifinals 17 of 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
Make it 17 of 19. 
</P>
<P>
"That (intensity) is what makes you a champion," Evert said. "There are a lot 
of players who can cause upsets and then, two days later, lose to someone 
ranked (No.) 100 in the world. That's why players like Steffi (Graf) and myself 
in the past, Martina (Navratilova), that's why we have been great because we 
have been able to take each match and isolate it and never have a letdown in a 
two-week tournament. This year, I have had letdowns after big matches, and that 
puts me right in with the average player." 
</P>
<P>
History will regard her far differently. Has any athlete in a major sport 
performed at a higher level longer than Evert? Since she began playing the 
women's tour regularly in 1975, Evert has been ranked No. 1 in the world five 
times and No. 2 seven times. In the last two years, at her nadir, she was 
ranked No. 3. Some nadir. 
</P>
<P>
Evert has won more singles titles (157) than anyone, and even with Tuesday's 
defeat, Evert reached the semifinals or better an unprecedented 52 of 56 times 
in Grand Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
Add she was president of the Women's Tennis Association for five years, has 
been a model of grace and good sportsmanship on the court and a friend to 
lesser players off it, and she bows out with a reputation as good as her 
record. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday, she was the indifferent and inconsistent player she is now 
resigned to being. Admittedly, she is no longer willing to pay the price. But 
that didn't mean she felt relieved when it was over. Chris Evert's greatness 
may be history, but it is hardly ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking I'd be relieved when the tournament was over for me," she said. 
"But the way I lost, I'm not relieved." 
</P>
<P>
Garrison was. Although she is the tournament's No. 5 seed, Garrison, 26, had 
beaten Evert only once in 10 tries before Tuesday. Such is the gap in women's 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as big as the gap between the 21,000 stadium court patrons who were 
rooting for Evert, and the two or three who were rooting for the otherwise 
likable Garrison. Like nearly every woman on the tour, Garrison grew up 
admiring Evert. After her landmark victory, Garrison recalled being 15 or 16 
and going with fellow future pro Lori McNeil -- the only other person to knock 
Evert out of the Open (1987) before the semifinals -- to see Evert when Evert 
came to Houston, their hometown. Their biggest kick was getting Evert's 
autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, to the displeasure of nearly everyone in attendance, Garrison wrote 
Evert's Grand Slam epitaph. And afterward, she delivered a eulogy of her own. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the hardest match I ever played in my life," Garrison said, "because 
it was such an emotional match. She's meant so much to the game. She's such a 
lady. To be the villain, to have to take her out of this tournament, it's good 
for me, but it wasn't good for me. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I can take over where she left off." 
</P>
<P>
Zina Garrison said that last thing because there were more than a hundred media 
people sitting there and there was empty air to fill. But deep down, she and 
everyone else in the room knew better than that. 
</P>
<P>
You don't replace Christine Marie Evert.

FIRST LOSING SEASON HAS PUSHED JOE PATERNO TO A RENEWED FOCUS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Penn State beat Virginia by 28 points in its season opener last year, 
Nittany Lions Coach Joe Paterno tried to console Cavaliers Coach George Welsh 
with some rare honesty: "Hey, I've got a pretty good group of people." 
</P>
<P>
What followed was Penn State's first losing season in 50 years. The whys for 
that 5-6 embarrassment included losing some of those pretty good people to 
injuries and Paterno thinking he could build teams and libraries at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I hurt my staff last year," he admitted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Paterno has been a major factor the last couple of years in Penn State's 
raising about $300 million for non-athletic purposes, his own special interests 
being libraries and minority scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many times I left (football) meetings with some things up in the air," he 
said. "I just did not get down to detail. And what happened, I think, is what 
usually happens -- you put just enough in to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"You stick your two cents in there, but you don't follow up. Or follow through. 
And you get people uneasy, confused. (Offensive coordinator) Fran Ganter had 
the toughest job in the country last year, because I was not that much (help). 
</P>
<P>
"I think that (inattention) probably filtered down to the football team. ... I 
deserved the kind of season we had." 
</P>
<P>
Among other changes this season, Paterno has tried to will 10 years off his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my wife (Sue) I'm not 62, I'm 52," he said. "I can't do what I want to 
do if I'm 62. I can only do what I want if I'm 52. If I could make some things 
happen (in his mid-60s) that I did (in his late 50s), I'd be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Penn State won the national championship in 1982 and 1986. At 62-going-on-52, 
Paterno dearly wants to follow last season's problems with another surge toward 
No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
For Virginia this week, Paterno has regained the services of the quarterback 
who played so well during that 42-14 victory last year and the tailback who was 
supposed to be running through the National Football League by now. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bill completed 15 of 22 passes for 179 yards and two touchdowns in his 
debut as Penn State's regular quarterback. Two games later, during a 21-16 loss 
here to Rutgers, he suffered a dislocated kneecap and missed the rest of the 
season. Previous injuries to other quarterbacks forced Paterno to use freshman 
Tony Sacca, who learned enough from adversity to challenge Bill for the job 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Paterno in prior years has preferred to choose a starter and go with him as 
long as possible. Against the Cavaliers, the coach said, Sacca also will play. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony's not as far along on some of the cute stuff," Paterno said, "some things 
we do on the line of scrimmage." 
</P>
<P>
Keenest anticipation for the offense is the return of tailback Blair Thomas, 
about whom Paterno has said: "We have not had a player in my 40 years on campus 
who works any harder, practices any harder, is more committed, more loyal and 
better liked." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, by the end of the 1987 regular season, had run for 1,414 yards and 
gained another 358 catching passes and returning kicks. Preparing for the 
Florida Citrus Bowl against Clemson in early December, he suffered a knee 
injury that required reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
His run for the Heisman Trophy delayed a year, Thomas four days before the 
opener is sound enough -- and his backups skilled enough -- so that last 
season's leading rusher, Gary Brown, has been moved to defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The first day back (for fall practice)," Thomas said, "I started running and 
cutting and I knew I was back (in top form). Right then and there. The second 
scrimmage, I got a hit on the knee, got it twisted in a strange way, and 
bounced right back up." 
</P>
<P>
During the final all-out scrimmage, nine days ago, Thomas lost to a foot injury 
the large fellow slated to escort him through Virginia and other defenses, 
fullback Sam Gash. Moving up will be an even larger blocker-runner, 6-foot-5, 
238-pound sophomore John Gerak. 
</P>
<P>
This has not caused Thomas to lower personal and team goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to have a better year than two years ago (which would put him in 
contention to pass Curt Warner and become State's all-time career rusher)," he 
said. "You don't ever stand still. You either get better or don't do as well." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was here when Penn State went 23-1 during a stretch that began with the 
start of the 1985 regular season and ended with a victory over Miami in the 
1987 Fiesta Bowl for the national championship. The only loss was the 1986 
Orange Bowl battle to Oklahoma for the national title. The Lions were 6-5 in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
"This pre-season has been different from the one last year," Thomas said. "Last 
year, the two-a-day practices each lasted an hour and a half, maybe an hour and 
45 minutes. This year, they've been 2 1/2 hours." 
</P>
<P>
That's why one of Paterno's concerns is fatigue. Perhaps he's pushed too hard 
too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping after (Tuesday) they'll start to feel good about themselves," he 
said. "I hope they'll start enjoying the game. Up to now, it's been work, work, 
work. ... This is a stoic team that works extremely hard, a very committed 
football team right now." 
</P>
<P>
Added offensive tackle Tim Freeman: "What I see is a lot of people ready to hit 
somebody."

REDSKINS ARE REALLY COUNTING ON GERALD RIGGS TO CARRY LOAD

<P>
A couple of assistant coaches walked up to Gerald Riggs in the Washington 
Redskins' locker room during training camp. They wore concerned looks on their 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy wants your insurance number," one of them told Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
"Huh," Riggs said. "What guy?" 
</P>
<P>
"The guy who owns the truck," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't my fault," Riggs said. 
</P>
<P>
"You caved in the whole side of his truck. He wants your insurance policy," the 
coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Riggs was getting worried. He then went up to Don Breaux, the backfield coach, 
to ask him if the guy was really looking for him. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Joe Gibbs, who was telling the story with a twinkle in his eye, said, 
"Breaux didn't have guts enough to continue it." 
</P>
<P>
He admitted the other coaches were pulling Riggs' leg. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been the highlight of my training," Riggs said with a smile of the 
night he banged into the truck. 
</P>
<P>
The tape of Riggs banging into the door of a television truck parked near the 
sidelines during a scrimmage in Carlisle, Pa., has made all the highlight 
shows. The truck door was the loser. It suffered $1,300 worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
Riggs came out of it none the worse for wear, but he didn't seem to think it 
was very funny at the time. His first reaction was that it was dangerous to 
have the truck parked so close to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, though, that collision was his real introduction to life with the 
Redskins. He's received more attention for hitting that truck than he did 
rushing for 6,631 yards in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he can joke about it. 
</P>
<P>
"If they start putting that on ESPN on bloopers or blunders or whatever, maybe 
I can get a little cut of that," Riggs said. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, nobody cared whether he hit a truck or an opposing player. Riggs 
was a great back, but the team still lost. It was almost as if a Picasso were 
hanging in a coal bin. 
</P>
<P>
"You just didn't get recognized," he said. "You go to the game on Sunday, and 
no matter what you do (you lose). People may say, 'Gerald had a big game.' 
That's about it. Gerald shows up the next week and does the same thing. It was 
just monotonous to do that every week. It was getting to be no fun." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, Riggs finally will start having fun. 
</P>
<P>
He'll be the trigger man for the Redskins' offense when they play the New York 
Giants in the first Monday night game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, the Falcons haven't played in a Monday night game since 1984. Riggs 
said he doesn't even remember it. It just happened to be against the Redskins 
-- a 27-14 loss in a 4-12 season. 
</P>
<P>
It was those kinds of numbers that made him eager to get out of Atlanta. Not 
that he takes any parting shots at the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed working with the guys in Atlanta and I love them to death and I'm 
always going to be friends with those guys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was nothing personal. He just wanted a chance to play with a winning team. 
He's got it. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it's like if I'm doing well and everybody else is doing well, it's almost 
guaranteed it's going to be a win," he said. "You feel like you can't lose." 
</P>
<P>
Don't tell that to Gibbs, who never says victories are guaranteed. But the 
Redskins are almost as excited about having Riggs as he is excited about 
wearing a Redskins uniform. 
</P>
<P>
They look at Riggs and they see John Riggins. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably unfair to compare the two, but Riggins set the standard for 
Redskins running backs, and Riggs has to live with it. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a great job for this team, but I don't worry about what he did," Riggs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim) 
</P>
<P>
Noting he replaced William Andrews in Atlanta, Riggs said, "Everybody has their 
heroes. I'm not on the list, apparently." 
</P>
<P>
He may be added to the list if he takes Washington to the Super Bowl. Meawhile, 
the Redskins often compare him to Riggins. 
</P>
<P>
"John was very aloof and didn't say a whole lot, but when he got in the huddle, 
he could get the line to perform a little better than they thought they could," 
offensive line coach Joe Bugel said. "Riggs is like Riggins in that sense. He 
says very little, but when he talks, they listen. 
</P>
<P>
"He commands a lot of respect in the huddle. We didn't have that last year. We 
didn't have charisma guys. The only guy who had a lot of charisma was Kelvin 
Bryant. Other than that, we were null and void." 
</P>
<P>
When the Redskins opened the season a year ago, their running back was Timmy 
Smith, who, it turned out, was a one-game, Super Bowl wonder. 
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim) 
</P>
<P>
Riggs is a proven commodity, already ranking No. 22 on the all-time NFL rushing 
list. Only Eric Dickerson has gained more yards than Riggs has the last five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
That he's compiled those numbers is one of the best-kept secrets in the game. 
The Falcons simply don't get noticed. Now, it's almost as if he's moving from 
off-Broadway to Broadway. His name will be in lights. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it's easy to think the Redskins will suit him up and ride him to 
another Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not exactly. There is a nagging question or two. 
</P>
<P>
The first one is his age. He turns 29 Nov. 6. Running backs are often an 
endangered species as they near 30. 
</P>
<P>
Riggs, though, scoffs at concerns about his age, although he said with a smile 
that he shaved his beard so the gray wouldn't show. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still young," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious coming to Washington has been akin to finding the fountain of 
youth for Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't appear concerned that George Rogers, the last man to try to replace 
Riggins, was finished at 29. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is different," Riggs said. "George was kind of burned out when he 
got here." 
</P>
<P>
Riggs said he's far from burned out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an inside guy," he said. "I don't mind the hits. It's not a big deal to me 
to run inside. Not many guys like to do it 20 times a game out of 30 carries. I 
think I've shown that. We'll see as the season goes." 
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end) 
</P>
<P>
He may feel a bit older after taking the pounding of a 16-game season. During 
the exhibition season, he didn't hit much besides the truck. He carried only 28 
times for 128 yards and sat out one game with a tight hamstring. It was just a 
test drive for Riggs. The Redskins now will see what he can do. 
</P>
<P>
They paid a steep price for him -- a second-round pick this year and a 
first-round choice next year. Gibbs said he had no second thoughts about that 
price. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins' whole season revolves around him. If he can be a consistent 
1,000-yard rusher, he'll take the burden off young quarterback Mark Rypien. 
</P>
<P>
Rypien is counting on 5- and 6-yard gains on first downs from Riggs so the 
defense doesn't know whether to expect run or pass on second down. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's second-and-4, the ball's in your court," Rypien said. "He's the type 
of guy who can carry the ball 30 to 35 times a game and still be as fresh as he 
was in the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
It won't take long for the Redskins to find out if they're going to get big 
dividends on the Riggs trade. They've had trouble beating the Giants in recent 
years because they haven't been able to run against them since Riggins' heyday.

MAJOR HARRIS KNOWS HOW TO RUN SHOW 
</P>

<P>
Sometimes, West Virginia quarterback Major Harris seems too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
Little kids come up to him after practice, after games, when he's walking down 
the street, and ask for autographs. Major Harris stops. He smiles. He signs 
until the last one is satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe his patience," says West Virginia Athletic Director Ed 
Pastilong. "He is like that all the time. The kids love him because he gives 
them what they want and his teammates love him because he is a team player. 
There is an esprit de corps among them. I think Major vying for the Heisman 
will have a positive effect on the overall team performance. Because of the 
love they have for him, they'll give a little extra for him." 
</P>
<P>
There are those who believe the West Virginia Mountaineers will have to give a 
lot extra, not only for Harris to win the Heisman, but also for the team to 
finish above .500. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, WVU opened the season by defeating Ball State, 35-10. This 
Saturday, the team travels to Byrd Stadium to take on Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
The Mountaineers are coming off the most amazing season in their history: 11-0 
in the regular season and a shot at the national championship in the Fiesta 
Bowl, which they lost to Notre Dame, 34-21. They finished fifth in the national 
polls, and Harris was fifth in the Heisman voting. 
</P>
<P>
Harris returns as one of the top Heisman contenders, but he is one of few West 
Virginia players returning from last season. Head coach Don Nehlen says the 
Mountaineers have lost 13 of their top 15 offensive players and six of the best 
11 on defense. Also gone are their punter and place-kicker. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a handful," says Nehlen. "But we ain't gonna forfeit and roll over. 
We've done a good job around here for nine years. ... We will get a TD or two. 
I don't know how just yet, but we will." 
</P>
<P>
Well, he does know how. Major Harris will see to it. The 6-foot-1, 207 pound 
Harris is the solder that binds. But he's not the entire machine. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever want him to think he has to do it all," says Nehlen. "But we'll 
ask him to do a lot, probably a lot more than last season. The fact is, every 
play starts with him having the ball. Sometimes he'll give it away, sometimes 
he won't. Major treats the whole thing like it's a game, and that's right." 
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim) 
</P>
<P>
Nehlen would love to see Harris win the Heisman. But he also says he 
understands what it will take for him to get it. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-one other guys have to help," says the WVU coach. "If the other 21 fall 
flat on their faces, he hasn't got a chance. But I tell you, if I was the right 
guard, and my quarterback was going for the Heisman, a little of that trophy 
would be mine." 
</P>
<P>
Harris is what his coaches call a "Now player." That means that whatever he is 
doing at the moment is the most important thing in the world: If he's at 
practice, it's practice. If he's in English class, it's English. If he's doing 
an interview, it's the interview. 
</P>
<P>
"With Major there is an image and then underneath there is a humble but complex 
kid," says WVU quarterback coach Dwight Wallace. "He's aware of our situation. 
He's aware of issues. He's a bright young guy who doesn't want it known. People 
take care of him -- and he let's them do it." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, the day he showed up at West Virginia, everyone realized he was a 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just his presence," says Wallace. "He's not demanding. He's, well, 
there's just something magical about him. And he's a great competitor. When 
he's playing pingpong, you'd think pingpong was his life. And if he falls 
behind, 17-3, he can literally talk his way back into the game and win." 
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim) 
</P>
<P>
Major Harris sits quietly on a sofa in the Mountaineers football building. He 
is almost demure. Can this be the quarterback? Is this No. 9, the guy with the 
rifle arm and the dancing feet? 
</P>
<P>
Where's the ego? Where's the self-important swagger? Where's the "I am the 
greatest" hyperbole? 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a game," says Harris. "A lot of people get caught up in it. All of 
West Virginia got caught up in it last year. But I'm just playing quarterback. 
I'm not carrying everyone on my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
But he adds, almost under his breath, "I'm not carrying them, but they can come 
along if they want to." 
</P>
<P>
He'd rather talk about his all-new offensive line than about himself. This 
year's line has fifth-year senior center Jeff Price (6-0, 257), fifth-year 
senior left guard Scottie Parker (6-5, 245), senior right guard Dale Wolfley 
(6-1, 260), fifth-year senior right tackle Matt Wracher (6-5, 265), fifth-year 
senior left tackle Jack Linn (6-4, 273) and fifth-year senior tight end Adrian 
Moss (6-5, 250). 
</P>
<P>
Last season, his veteran offensive line took very good care of him. This 
season, he says, the new model will too, even though forecasters are knocking 
the Mountaineers' chances. 
</P>
<P>
"The season has barely started," says Harris. "We've all got an equal shot. 
This team feels like it can beat anybody -- like Penn State in the past. It's 
an attitude. To stay in the top 20 or the top 10, you have to have an attitude 
when you go on the field. We were up last year. We're going to stay up." 
</P>
<P>
Price, who played in every game last season, echoes Harris' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of experienced guys on this line," he says. "We know Maj is a 
candidate for the Heisman, and we're going to be blocking to win each game to 
enhance his chances. We're going to give him time and space, then we'll see 
what happens." 
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end) 
</P>
<P>
Wallace says Harris may not do things on the field "the way you want it done," 
but adds, "he always gets it done. You've got to coach Major with results in 
mind. He shoots from the hip within the structure of the offense. That's what 
makes him different. Others lack discipline, but Major stays within the 
structure." 
</P>
<P>
Given last season's performance -- he completed 105 of 186 passes for 1,915 
yards and 14 touchdowns and rushed 134 times for six touchdowns and 610 yards, 
a 4.6 yards per carry average -- it is difficult to believe Harris is still 
developing. But his knowledge of the multiple set is improving and so is his 
recognition of defensive coverages. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about Major is he's still just having fun playing a game," says 
Wallace. "The pressure has always been on him. I think he has run the whole 
show ever since junior high school. He expects to. There isn't anything new 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
For the Mountaineers, Harris is special. And yet, as Pastilong, the athletic 
director, puts it, WVU has been getting ready for a Major Harris for some time 
now. 
</P>
<P>
First there was quarterback Oliver Luck, a Rhodes Scholar who went on to play 
for the Houston Oilers and who is now in a Washington, D.C., law firm. Then 
came Jeff Hostetler, an NCAA Academic All-American who is now with the New York 
Giants. And now there is Major Harris, a prime candidate for the Heisman 
Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite a string," says Pastilong. "Quite a string." 
</P>
<P>
And at West Virginia, the feeling is that the best is yet to come.

WEST VIRGINIA HOPES FOR ENCORE TO ITS SURPRISING 1988 SEASON

<P>
The college football world awaits an encore. 
</P>
<P>
Without one, West Virginia University's miraculous season of a year ago will 
become just a memory, and its chance to be mentioned in the same breath as such 
Eastern football powers as Penn State and Pittsburgh will fade with it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's show time again," said starting senior tailback Eugene Napoleon. 
"Everybody thought last year was a fluke. We know that. Now, if we do it again 
in 1989, then the Beast of the East has declared a permanent residence in the 
state of West Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
It will be tough. The 17th-ranked Mountaineers (1-0), who play the University 
of Maryland (0-1) Saturday at Byrd Stadium, have lost 13 starters from last 
year's team -- nine on offense, including the entire offensive line, and four 
on defense. The 1988 Mountaineers went 11-1 and lost to Notre Dame in the 
Sunkist Fiesta Bowl, 34-21, in a game that decided the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule also has improved this season. Gone are Bowling Green and 
California State Fullerton. Added are South Carolina and Louisville to 
traditional Eastern powers Penn State, Pittsburgh and Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Problems? 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, we knew we were going to have a good football team because of 
that recruiting class," said West Virginia Coach Don Nehlen, entering his 10th 
season. "We also knew that some day, all those seniors were going to leave. We 
have prepared for that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm anxious to see if our program can handle it. We've worked hard in 
recruiting every year. I'm anxious to see if we can reload. I think we'll be 
all right. We'll show up for some games even if I have to shave my head and go 
out there and catch some passes myself. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, I think we have a pretty darn good quarterback, you know." 
</P>
<P>
The entire nation knows. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, quarterback Major Harris finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting 
and is the top returning vote-getter. Now a junior, he is one of the top 
contenders at his position, along with Notre Dame's Tony Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Mountaineers players say Harris, 6-foot-1, 207 pounds, is the great equalizer. 
Last year he had to play with other superstars. 
</P>
<P>
This year it's Harris' show. 
</P>
<P>
And you haven't seen anything yet, his teammates say. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes everybody play better," said Mountaineers junior offensive guard Dale 
Wolfley. "It's his attitude, his desire and hustle. As an offensive lineman, I 
would love to see him win the Heisman, because a piece of that would belong to 
all of us." 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to get better, believe me," said Nehlen. "I don't want Major to 
think he has to do it all, but we're going to ask more from him this year than 
last season." 
</P>
<P>
Again, an encore is demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Harris piled up 2,525 yards in total offense. He carried 134 times 
for 610 years and completed 105 of 186 passes for 1,915 yards and 14 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
A versatile performer, he can run the option or throw on the run. Or pass from 
the pocket. Or turn a broken play into a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Major Harris is the most explosive player in the country," said Maryland Coach 
Joe Krivak. "And it's not just because we're playing them. He can make 
something out of nothing faster than you can blink an eye. He can do it going 
to his right, left or falling while on one foot." 
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end) 
</P>
<P>
Still, a national championship seems a remote possibility for West Virginia, 
but make no mistake, this team still has a lot of talent. 
</P>
<P>
Junior backup quarterback Greg Jones, a transfer from the University of Miami, 
could start for most other Division I schools. Junior Reggie Rembert, at 6-6, 
200, is one of the premier wideouts in the country, and fellow receiver James 
"The" Jett is one of the best-looking freshmen in the East. Nehlen says the 
tight-end position, with 6-5, 250-pound senior Adrian Moss the starter, is the 
strongest it ever has been. 
</P>
<P>
Tailbacks Anthony Brown and Undra Johnson are gone, but Napoleon gained 241 
yards on 44 carries last season as the No. 3 rusher. And while the offensive 
line is new, the unit played on every third series in every game a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, the Mountaineers are just as strong as last season, with six 
starters back. The linebacking should be the strength of the unit with Renaldo 
Turnbull and Lonnie Brockman on the outside and Chris Haering and Theron Ellis 
on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia will have three games televised on the Jefferson-Pilot network 
this season and another on ESPN. The Mountaineers, said Athletic Director Ed 
Pastilong, also will add Purdue, Ohio State and Florida State to its schedule 
in the next three years.

"That season brought us to the front of a lot of people's attention," said 
Pastilong. "The fact that we got to play Notre Dame for the national 
championship did that. We've been a well-established program for a long time. 
Now people know we have the ability to compete for the national championship." 
</P>
<P>
Or do they?

"We have to prove it one more time," said Napoleon. "One more time."

'WORLD' IS TURNING A LOT OF HEADS AT GRAMBLING

It is not every college football player who could walk up to Howard 
University's 360-pound Willie Felder and ask, "What's up, Tiny?" 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday night at the New Jersey Meadowlands, when Howard meets Grambling 
in the Urban League's Whitney Young Classic, Felder will be just another little 
guy next to Grambling's Raymond "World" Smith III. 
</P>
<P>
Few gave the 6-foot-6 Smith a chance of making it in college football, 
especially at the Division I-AA level, after he graduated from H.D. Woodson 
High School here tipping the scales at 465 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
He went to Grambling in Louisiana, and even Eddie Robinson, the coach who has 
won more college games than anyone else, found something he could not believe. 
</P>
<P>
"He was surprised I was this big, and he was surprised I could move," said 
Smith, a junior who has earned the starting job at left offensive tackle. "Most 
people are surprised at my quickness. They think I am like the average big 
person who can't move." 
</P>
<P>
Grambling was unprepared to take on the World. As a freshman, Smith couldn't 
play in the first two games because the school could not obtain uniform pants 
big enough. 
</P>
<P>
This was not a novel problem, however. At H.D. Woodson, his uniform pants 
consisted of two extra large pairs sewn together. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Grambling opened in Los Angeles with a 35-30 victory over Alcorn 
State. The trip gave Smith an opportunity commonplace for most people, but rare 
for him: he could weigh himself. The extra-capacity scale at the Los Angeles 
Raiders training facility said Smith's size 58 pants helped clothe 428 pounds 
-- before dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is playing on what is expected to be a top 20 Division I-AA team, and for 
a coach who has sent more players on to professional football than any other. 
All of which tells of Smith's development. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a great pass blocker," Robinson said. "And when he traps them, they stay 
trapped. When he leads a sweep, they get swept." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he has worked hard to improve on blocking techniques since entering 
Grambling. His size leads most teams to test him quickly, usually with a 
variety of tricks. 
</P>
<P>
"I am already used to all of the stunts," said Smith, who in sixth grade was 
6-1, 365 and bigger than his father, himself a football player. "They usually 
line up a man over my head and try to get a speed rusher around me from the 
outside. But when they load up on my side, we just start running plays to the 
strong (right) side." 
</P>
<P>
Howard, which upset Grambling in Giants Stadium last year, 35-20, is looking 
forward not only to the rematch but also a chance to go against a most unusual 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"I am looking at it as a challenge," said David Westbrooks, Howard's 6-4, 
253-pound right defensive end who will go at Smith most of the night. "One 
thing I know is that I will not try to bowl him over. It only took one time 
going head-to-head against Big Willie (an offensive tackle) in practice to 
learn that you have to get real low against someone that size." 
</P>
<P>
Howard defensive coordinator Charlie West, who spent 12 years in the NFL with 
the Vikings, Lions and Broncos, said the Bison are likely to aggressively test 
Smith early. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a guy who weighs 420 pounds, it is hard to move him," West said. 
"But size never concerns me. It is effectiveness I am concerned with. I think I 
have seen every big man that has ever played the game. Most of my time with 
Denver, we were smaller than most other teams, but we were quick and found a 
way to beat a lot of those teams."

CAL LUTHERAN FALLS SHORT AGAINST SONOMA STATE, 17-9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was a sparkling afternoon in wine country, but Cal Lutheran died on the vine 
Saturday in a nonconference football opener at Sonoma State. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen lost, 17-9, after failing on a fourth-quarter two-point conversion 
and then coming up short on two last-ditch attempts to score. 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma State overcame seven turnovers and 16 penalties in front of a Campus 
Field gathering of 1,374 fans. It was Sonoma State's first victory in the 
schools' eight-game series. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt when we lost the conversion," Cal Lutheran Coach Bob Shoup said. "Then 
you're playing for the tie instead of the win." 
</P>
<P>
With 4:54 remaining, Cal Lutheran scored on a 15-yard pass from Dan Nagelmann 
to Tony Leogrande on fourth and 10. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen lined up to kick the extra point but a Sonoma State defender 
rushed offside so quickly that he, and not Cal Lutheran kicker Greg Maw, kicked 
the ball. The resultant penalty cut the distance to the goal line in half, so 
Cal Lutheran opted to go for two points. 
</P>
<P>
But Nagelmann's pass for Shane Hawkins was intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
"I just read it wrong," said Nagelmann, who relieved starter Tim Zeddies late 
in the third quarter. "He was going straight for the corner and I thought he 
was going to go inside." 
</P>
<P>
With CLU trailing, 17-9, the defense held, and the Kingsmen got the ball on 
their 20 with more than two minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Another Nagelmann-to-Leogrande pass moved the Kingsmen to their 41, but Cal 
Lutheran surrendered the ball on downs. 
</P>
<P>
Again the defense held, but Nagelmann was sacked as the last seconds ticked off 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Cal Lutheran had many scoring opportunities but the Kingsmen 
could generate only three points on five Sonoma State turnovers -- three 
interceptions and two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the second quarter, Cal Lutheran safety Nicko Rising made a 
diving interception at the Kingsmen 14. The offense capitalized with its only 
sustained drive of the first half, a 16-play march that culminated in a 25-yard 
field goal by Maw. 
</P>
<P>
"We played pretty good defense in the first half," Shoup said. "I felt our 
defense was very opportunistic, but the offense didn't take advantage. Then we 
let them slip away in the third quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma State's leading returning rusher, Chris Vogler, strained his left 
quadriceps in the first quarter and the Cossack offense struggled. 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma State switched quarterbacks to begin the second half, Danny Calcagno 
replacing starter Steve Mytinger. 
</P>
<P>
Mytinger, a drop-back passer, had been largely ineffective, but Calcagno 
(5-feet-10, 175 pounds) sparked a 17-point third-quarter rally. 
</P>
<P>
"They just rolled out and were dragging the tight end, and we didn't do the 
job," said inside linebacker Cary Caulfield, who intercepted a pass and 
recovered a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Caulfield also punted, and he kicked more often than the Radio City Rockettes, 
although he didn't look quite as good doing it. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 22 yards on eight punts, had two blocked and saw another returned 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we want to improve this year is special teams," said Tim 
Walsh, who is in his first season as Sonoma State's coach. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup began his 28th season at Cal Lutheran on a down note and will now point 
his team toward a 2 p.m. home game Saturday against St. Mary's.

PIERCE PREVAILS, 40-39, DESPITE BEING OUTGAINED, 554-243 
</P>

<P>
In a wild offensive show in which Pierce College was outgained, 554-243, in 
total offense, the Brahmas still managed to pull the rug out from under East 
Los Angeles on the Huskies' synthetic turf Saturday night in the teams' 
nonconference opener. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, which a year ago finished last in defense in the Western State 
Conference, salvaged a 40-39 victory when Danny Dolan misfired on a 39-yard 
field goal attempt as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahmas, who had forced just one punt all night, earned a reprieve less 
than two minutes earlier when Scott Schaeffer intercepted Larry Razo's pass at 
the Pierce six-yard line with 1:51 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen an interception that was any better. I'm not sure he trapped 
it or what," Pierce Coach Bob Enger said. "I guess I've got to fire my 
defensive coordinator." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's Louis Vann scored on three two-yard touchdown runs and rushed for 122 
yards in 28 carries. 
</P>
<P>
There were four lead changes in the second half and the Brahmas took the lead 
for good on Jamie Grossman's 13-yard touchdown pass to Shannon Culver with 4:55 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce led, 21-14, at halftime and built the lead to 28-14 when Ronnie Harrison 
returned the second-half kickoff 75 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams moved the ball virtually at will in a penalty-filled first half. 
East Los Angeles was flagged seven times for 70 yards and Pierce was penalized 
six times for 52. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies scored on the game's opening possession, marching 64 yards in eight 
plays. Adan Avina, who rushed for 95 yards in the first half and finished with 
259 in 27 carries, scored on a 17-yard sideline run and Dolan's kick put East 
L.A. ahead, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce countered on its first possession, driving 68 yards in 13 plays and 
scoring on Vann's two-yard run. Andrew Munoz's extra point tied the score, 7-7, 
with 3:45 left in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
East L.A. went ahead on its next possession as quarterback Razo scored on a 
six-yard bootleg. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce answered on its second possession as Vann scored again on a two-yard run 
to cap a 57-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman's 28-yard pass to wide receiver Chad Zeigler with 44 seconds left 
rounded out the first-half scoring.

PRESS ADDS TO NASCAR LEAD WITH SAUGUS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

How is Dan Press driving? Dial 1-800-EAT DUST. 
</P>
<P>
Rewriting the NASCAR All-American Challenge Series Southwest Tour record book, 
Press, a resident of Frazier Park, increased his sizable points lead Saturday 
night, racing to his record seventh victory of the season before a crowd of 
5,861 at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
The competition, which has seen little more than Press' rear bumper this 
season, may as well have phoned this one in. 
</P>
<P>
Press, the field's fastest qualifier, started eighth in a partially inverted 
starting system but climbed into the lead for good on Lap 54 of the 100-lap 
race by virtue of skillful inside passes on the one-third-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Press roared unchallenged to the checkered flag, his lead pared 
only by three lengthy yellow flags that helped extend the race into a 78-minute 
marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Press finished one second ahead of pole-sitter Mike Chase of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We started running the tour on and off when it started a few years ago," Press 
said. "But we knew we had the potential. We knew if we could get our stuff 
together, we were going to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Press has been a smashing success. He is the only driver in the Tour's 
four-year history with more than five victories in a season. He also is the 
only driver to post three top one-lap qualifying times in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, Press established a track record with a one-lap time of 
15.58 seconds. The mark was the fastest of eight qualifying marks that bettered 
Press' record time of 15.75 seconds established in June. That night, Press won 
the 125-lap Southwest Tour event at Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a little bit faster at Saugus," said Chase, the Tour's 1987 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
With the win, Press extended his points lead over Troy Beebe of Modesto to 134 
points with four races remaining. He earned $3,200 for the victory. Press' 
earnings this season stand at $30,424. 
</P>
<P>
Barring misfortune, Press is a certainty to eclipse the Tour's season record of 
$35,501, set by defending champion Roman Calczynski of Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
Calczynski, winless this season, finished third. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, Steve Teets of Poway won the 25-lap Southwest Tour semi-main 
event to advance to the main event. Kevin Riniker of Riverside finished second.

MENLO HURTS OCCIDENTAL PLAYOFF BID EARLY, 16-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer

<P>
It was only the season opener but the ramifications of its outcome branded it 
as a potential season ender. 
</P>
<P>
At Occidental College where conference football championships have become 
almost expected, and somewhat unfairly, the measure of true success is making 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night at Occidental, the Tigers made their chances of gaining their 
first playoff invitation in four years more difficult by suffering a 16-14 
nonconference defeat to Menlo College. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go 8-1 and make the playoffs," Occidental Coach Dale Widolff said, 
"but you have to win eight in a row now. Before tonight we had the luxury of a 
loss or tie." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental spotted Menlo a 13-0 lead before getting its offense into gear in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Behind senior quarterback Tony Werbelow -- who completed a nine-yard touchdown 
pass to Rob Leinbach -- and sophomore running back Steve McClaskey -- who 
scored on a two-yard run -- the Tigers rallied to take a 14-13 lead with 9:03 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
But on the ensuing kickoff, which took place from the 50-yard line because of a 
penalty against Menlo on the extra point, Dan Wahl caught the ball on the Menlo 
five and weaved through Occidental defenders for a 76-yard return. With 4:26 
left Blair Naegle kicked a 28-yard field goal that gave the Oaks the margin of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"When he started running the ball out, I was happy because I didn't think he'd 
get past the 20," Widolff said of the return. "We'd like to think of ourselves 
as a field-position team, but we gave them great starts the whole night." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's final threat ended when John Till intercepted a pass by Werbelow 
at the Menlo 46 with two minutes left. Werbelow completed 15 of 24 passes for 
135 yards and threw two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The loss tarnished an outstanding debut by McClaskey, a transfer from Azusa 
Pacific who rushed for 109 yards in 24 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Senior quarterback Greg Clark was the standout performer for Menlo, completing 
eight of 17 passes for 133 yards and two scores. 
</P>
<P>
On a first-and-15 situation from the Occidental 40 on the last play of the 
first quarter, Clark took the snap and rolled right to the sideline where he 
encountered a mass of Tigers. While Clark wheeled around and sprinted to the 
left hash mark, wide receiver Chris Lupenui stood alone doing jumping jacks in 
the right corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Clark pivoted and fired a pass to Lupenui for a touchdown that capped an 
13-play 87-yard drive and a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's second touchdown pass, a 41-yard play, came with 3:19 left in the third 
quarter.

PIRI, BLUMKIN LIFT CS NORTHRIDGE OVER MASTER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge halfback Scott Piri scored on an assist from Bobby Reyes 
five minutes into the second half Saturday, and goalkeeper Jeff Blumkin 
recorded the Matadors' second consecutive shutout, stopping The Master's 
College, 1-0, before a crowd of 2,111 in a nonconference soccer match at 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The teams combined for 56 fouls, four yellow cards, and two red cards. Master's 
(1-2) was down a player for 27 minutes in the second half because of a red card 
issued to Randy Whitfield, but the Matadors (2-0) could not capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second game in a row in which a CSUN player received a red card, 
this one going to Ed Burns. Blumkin was filling in for Mike Littman, who was 
red-carded for fighting in the Matadors' win over Cal State Los Angeles on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount 1, Occidental 0 -- The Tigers were unable to score for the 
second consecutive day and were eliminated from the Azusa Pacific tournament. 
Loyola broke a scoreless tie with 13 minutes to play. Goalie Lewis Tierney had 
eight saves for Occidental (0-2).

NEW COACHES BREAK EVEN IN OPENERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As far as debuts go, things didn't turn out too badly for several first-year 
coaches Friday night. Of the eight Valley-area coaches opening 1989 at a new 
school, four won and four lost. And the point spread in three of the four 
losses was 10 points or less. 
</P>
<P>
The results: 
</P>
<P>
* Palmdale and Coach Kent Bothwell lost to Muir, 14-7. Muir is the top-ranked 
team in the Southern Section Division II preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
* Newbury Park and Coach George Hurley pulled off a mild 17-3 upset of Agoura, 
snapping a two-game losing streak to the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
* Westlake and Coach Jim Benkert fell to Buena, 35-30. Buena was a Division II 
playoff semifinalist last season and Westlake was 2-8. 
</P>
<P>
* Hart and Coach Mike Herrington humbled Canyon, extending the Indians' win 
streak over their cross-town rival to three games. Calling Herrington a 
first-year coach might be stretching it -- he took over last month. 
</P>
<P>
* Crespi and Coach Tim Lins lost to Redlands, 17-7. With three scholarship 
players gone from the backfield, the Celts stayed close until turnovers did 
them in during the second half. 
</P>
<P>
* St. Francis and Coach Bill Garrison lost to Burroughs, 23-8, but the Golden 
Knights have company. All three Valley-area Del Rey League teams (Crespi, 
Alemany and St. Francis) lost Friday. 
</P>
<P>
* St. Genevieve and Coach Mark Lovett defeated Murphy, 9-7, snapping a 
seven-game losing streak in which the Valiants had been outscored, 221-38. Last 
season, St. Genevieve was held to seven points or less seven times in nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
* Behind a pair of second-half touchdowns, L. A. Baptist and Coach Mark Bates 
defeated Cathedral, 15-12. 
</P>
<P>
In all, a fair first night, considering the combined record for the eight teams 
was 35-44 last year.

CONSCIENTIOUS RECYCLING EFFORTS PAY OFF IN KEY FIRST DOWN FOR HART

In terms that only a kid with an overstuffed, dog-eared football playbook can 
appreciate, it is called the "recycle." It has nothing to do with melting down 
aluminum beer cans and bottles, although its effect was roughly the equivalent

In Hart's 30-12 win over cross-town rival Canyon last Friday night, quarterback 
Rob Westervelt and crew pulled a trick out of the Canyon repertoire and it 
proved to be the game's turning point. 
</P>
<P>
And if anything's good enough to use once, why not use it again, right? 
</P>
<P>
With Hart leading, 14-6, on its opening drive of the third quarter, the Indian 
offense stalled at the 50-yard line. Rather than punt on fourth and six, 
however, first-year Coach Mike Herrington told Westervelt to run the recycle, a 
variation in the volume and rhythm of the cadence that is designed to entice 
the defense into jumping offside. 
</P>
<P>
"We say 'Hut one, set, hut one, set,' over and over," Westervelt said. "We were 
just gonna take the penalty if they didn't go for it." 
</P>
<P>
The delay-of-game flag never came. Canyon jumped offside -- something its 
offense has made opposing defenses do innumerable times over the years -- 
setting up a fourth-and-one play. The Indians liked the gimmick so much that 
they used it again. Now that's recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon again jumped offside and, given new life by the ensuing first down, Hart 
took a 20-6 lead when Westervelt hit tight end Chad Fotheringham with a 10-yard 
scoring pass, capping a 10-play, 75-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
The win gave Westervelt and his senior classmates a clean sweep of sorts. The 
Canyon class of 1990 never beat Hart at any level in football, and the Hart 
varsity has knocked off Canyon three years in a row, which, of course, is 
called threecycling. 
</P>
<P>
Westervelt pulled an impressive recycling act of his own. In Hart's 33-28 win 
last year, he completed 18 of 26 passes for 228 yards and four touchdowns. 
Friday, he nearly duplicated that, hitting 18 of 24 passes for 263 yards and 
three touchdowns for a two-game total of 36 completions in 50 tries for 491 
yards and seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
So much for continuity: Here is one postgame footnote that Herrington would 
like to change next season. Sure, Canyon has lost to Hart three years in a row, 
but the Cowboys have fallen to three coaches, too: Rick Scott (1987), Dave 
Carson (1988) and Herrington. 
</P>
<P>
Flashy flashbacks: In Burroughs' 23-8 win over St. Francis, Danny Suarez took 
the opening kickoff and ran it back 78 yards for an apparent touchdown. 
Although it was ruled that Suarez had stepped out of bounds at the St. Francis 
12-yard line, it was certainly reminiscent of the 1988 opener between the same 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Burroughs receiver Steven Hubbell returned the opening kickoff 98 
yards for a touchdown to give the Indians a 7-0 lead before most of the crowd 
had taken their seats. Hubbell returned another kickoff 96 yards for a 
touchdown as Burroughs won, 22-21. 
</P>
<P>
Add flashbacks: Crespi quarterback Bill Canalez threw a pass that was 
intercepted by Redlands defensive back Gary Yesionek in the Celts' 17-7 loss, 
but he can at least take solace in the fact that he is still two up on his 
predecessor, Ron Redell, now at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
In last season's 28-6 loss to Redlands, Yesionek intercepted three Redell 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
Flying high again: Saugus' 30-12 win over South Pasadena marked the first time 
that the Centurions have reached the 30-point plateau in 13 games, dating a 
37-22 win over Ridgecrest Burroughs in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus junior Jeff Hickman, who took over at quarterback two weeks ago when 
starter Rob Weeg left the team because of personal reasons, passed for 131 
yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Crossing the black-and-blue line: Last season, Chatsworth Coach Myron Gibford 
was faced with a decision -- go with sophomore Tyler Johnston and build for the 
future, or try a short-term fix and use an older starter at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Gibford chose Johnston and, statistically, he wound up the worst quarterback in 
the North Valley League, completing just 35 of 100 passes for no touchdowns and 
throwing 14 interceptions. Building for the future has its risks. 
</P>
<P>
"I used him because I thought he'd be back," Gibford said. 
</P>
<P>
Guess again. Johnston is now attending a prep school in Minnesota -- after 
receiving a hockey scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that was his real first love," Gibford said. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando of Florida returns: Todd Orlando, who played on the varsity basketball 
team at El Camino Real High as a sophomore but missed last season after moving 
to Florida to live with his father, is expected back at El Camino Real when 
school opens Tuesday, according to Coach Mike McNulty. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando, a 6-foot senior guard, has the kind of perimeter shot that could have 
put the Conquistadores over the top last season. El Camino Real advanced to the 
City Section 3-A semifinals before losing to eventual champion Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very good outside shooter," said McNulty, who lost his starting guard 
tandem of Russell Reid and Jason Farrell to graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Former El Camino Real assistant Jeff Davis, now coach at West Valley League 
rival Canoga Park, says Orlando probably makes El Camino Real the team to beat 
in league play. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd has the ability to be a fantastic player," Davis said. "When he's on, he 
can just shoot the lights out. He could be the difference."

The Ft. Lauderdale Strikers scored three consecutive second-half goals and 
defeated the San Diego Nomads, 3-1, in the first National Pro Soccer 
Championship game Saturday night at Spartan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The match was the first outdoor national professional championship game since 
the North American Soccer League folded in 1985. The Nomads were representing 
the nine-team Western Soccer League, the Strikers the East Coast's American 
Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 8,632 watched the teams play to a scoreless first half before the 
Strikers broke the 90-minute match open. 
</P>
<P>
After spotting the Nomads a 1-0 lead at 73:13 on a goal by forward Jerome 
Watson, the Strikers surged offensively, much as they had done all season. Eric 
Eichmann, a U.S. national team player and hero in the United States' recent 1-0 
victory over Soviet power Dnepr, scored the tying goal on an assist by Ricardo 
Alonso just 1:01 after Watson's goal. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Edwards put the Strikers ahead, 2-1 with his first goal of the season at 
84:40, assisted by Marcelo Carrera and Pedro Magallanes. 
</P>
<P>
Ft. Lauderdale put the Nomads away when Carrera, his team's offensive leader 
throughout the match, drove a shot into the back of the net at 89:00. 
</P>
<P>
The goaltenders dominated the first half. Ft. Lauderdale's 14-year U.S. 
professional Arnie Mausser and San Diego's Jeff Duback, of the U.S. national 
team, combined for 14 saves. 
</P>
<P>
Mausser, an imposing force at 6-feet-4, 200 pounds, twice stopped San Diego 
forward Paul Wright in one-on-one situations.

NIKISHKA KICKS BACK, THEN KICKS IT IN TO WIN OSUNITAS

<TEXT>
<P>
Trainer Joe Cannon knew that if he could just get his filly, Nikishka, to relax 
in Saturday's $84,350 Osunitas Handicap at Del Mar, she'd have a good chance to 
win her first race on turf. 
</P>
<P>
So after Nikishka won the 1 1/16-mile race for fillies and mares 3 years old 
and up, Cannon realized he couldn't have picked a more soothing influence than 
jockey Chris McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron bided his time perfectly as Nikishka settled back into fourth at the 
half pole. Then at the far turn, when it was time to take care of business, 
Nikishka shot past Daring Doone and continued strongly down the stretch to win 
by a length. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris got her to relax today, and that's probably the key to the race," Cannon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Nikishka's last race here Aug. 13, she was boxed in but still had enough to 
win. Cannon said he had visions of the same thing happening Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like there was absolutely no room, but somehow Chris got her 
through," Cannon said. "He did an excellent job." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron, who won his fourth stakes race of the meeting, said he had plenty of 
confidence in his horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked a Grade I winner behind her one morning on the turf and couldn't get 
by her . . . and she was going a mile, and my horse was going seven-eighths," 
McCarron said. "She was a little tough to place at first (Saturday) but relaxed 
well when she passed the stands. She's a very long filly with a long stride and 
handled the turf well." 
</P>
<P>
Although Saturday was Nikishka's first turf race in seven starts, Cannon said 
it won't be her last. 
</P>
<P>
"She has that super turf breeding, and the idea was to get her on the grass at 
some point," Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
That might have come sooner had Nikishka not suffered bleeding problems last 
year, which caused her to lay off for six months. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave it lots of time to heal itself, and we now run her on Lasix," Cannon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon said he'll take Nikishka to the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita and 
continue to run on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Nikishka, owned by Aaron Jones, paid $10.20, $4.60 and $4.40, Daring Doone 
$3.40 and $3 and Gold Firecracker $6.40. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Gary Stevens was resting comfortably following surgery Friday night. 
Stevens, tied with Eddie Delahoussaye for the riding lead with 41 victories, 
required a plastic surgeon for a deep gash on his forehead and an orthopedic 
specialist for two broken bones in his right hand and one in his right wrist. 
Stevens was injured in the third race Friday when Bin Of Ice crashed through 
the inside fence in midstretch of the turf course. Ray Kravagna, Stevens' 
agent, said Stevens will be probably be released today and is expecting him to 
be back for the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita, which begins Oct. 4... Laffit 
Pincay Jr. will pick up Stevens' ride, On The Line, in today's $200,000-added 
Budweiser/Breeder's Cup. On The Line is trained by D. Wayne Lukas. . . . 
Kentucky Derby winner Sunday Silence worked a mile in a blistering 1:33 2/5, 
just 1/5 second off the Del Mar track record, between the second and third 
races. With regular rider Pat Valenzuela aboard, Sunday Silence ran the last 
quarter in 23 seconds. Trained by Charlie Whittingham, Sunday Silence is 
scheduled to make his next start in the Super Derby at Louisiana Downs Sept. 
24.

PANAMA STILL A DIPLOMATIC TIME FUSE FOR U.S. FOREIGN POLICY IN HEMISPHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard C. Hottelet, Richard C. Hottelet, a longtime CBS news correspondent, 
was one of the foreign observers invited by the Panamanian government during 
elections last spring.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sept. 1 has come and gone, a milestone in the dismal relations between the 
United States and Panama. It was to have been a deadline. The Organization of 
American States had ordered Gen. Manuel Antonia Noriega to transfer power to a 
democratic government by then -- otherwise there would be a dangerous political 
vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential terms of Eric Arturo Delvalle, recognized by Washington, and 
of Manuel Solis Palma, Noriega's man, expired on the first of the month. But 
the general remained in charge. Smiling and cocky, he simply installed a new 
government, calling it "provisional" to sugarcoat its illegality, and thumbed 
his nose to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Bush Administration starts another policy review. It has already 
reconsidered Ronald Reagan's two years of misguided macho. That mishmash of 
uncoordinated political and economic pressures, bungled overt and covert 
operations, public saber-rattling and cozy, secret bargaining with Noriega led 
back to square one. The Reagan Administration built the little dictator up as 
the larger-than-life adversary of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
President George Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III also want to 
remove Noriega from power. They have discarded Reagan's unilateralism and 
sought the support of Latin American and Western democracies. They say there 
will be no quick fix. Whatever is done will take time. But what can be done? 
</P>
<P>
Bush has explicitly affirmed multilateralism. But, especially on Capitol Hill, 
there is an aversion to moving through the OAS. The United States took the 
Panama question to the organization in May -- after Noriega annulled the 
election his candidate had lost by a landslide. But the OAS only juggled the 
issue, sending a mission to Noriega to promote agreement on his departure. 
After three months he had not agreed or shown any signs that he would. 
Unwilling to use what teeth it has against a regime that almost all of them 
despise, the American states merely shrugged. The fact is that they are more 
afraid of U.S. intervention than Noriega -- drug trafficking, corruption and 
all. When the feckless OAS mission threw in the towel late in August, it 
asserted "inopportune" U.S. military maneuvers in Panama had had a "negative 
effect" on its work. 
</P>
<P>
The mood in Congress, shared to some extent in the State Department and the 
National Security Council, is therefore to ignore the OAS. The United States, 
some $50 million behind in its dues to the organization, may cut its payments 
further. As an alternative, it may try to form a network of like-minded 
governments, including Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina 
and Jamaica. While not breaking off diplomatic relations, these nations have 
withdrawn their ambassadors from Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Washington must indeed cultivate good relations with nations of the Western 
Hemisphere. However, the history of Latin America indicates that no nation will 
join the United States in an operation against another. If a Panama settlement 
is to stick, it must have the sanction of the OAS as a body. 
</P>
<P>
As it considers what to do, the Administration intensifies economic and 
military-psychological pressure on Noriega -- while trying not to conjure up 
the Latino nightmare of Yankee invasion. Withholding payment of Panama Canal 
tonnage fees and various taxes, freezing Panamanian assets in the United 
States, striking the Panamanian sugar quota and the U.S. foreign assistance 
programs have been painful but not decisive. There are loopholes to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
Military pressure requires finer tuning. One of Bush's early moves was to 
direct that U.S. installations and rights under the Panama Canal Treaty be 
defended and the forces of U.S. Southern Command not stand for harassment. "We 
will not tolerate interference in our fulfillment of our treaty obligations 
from any quarter," the United States declared in the U.N. Security Council. To 
this end, U.S. troops have been reinforced and have conducted military 
exercises. Efforts by Noriega's Panama Defense Forces to hinder legitimate 
passage or penetrate U.S. areas are quickly squelched. 
</P>
<P>
Officials admit this tough stance holds the potential for violent 
confrontation, but say there is no desire to provoke it. Yet, as one put it, 
"Noriega gets drunk frequently. He could do something stupid that would force 
the United States to take action." The message to Noriega: Don't get rough. 
</P>
<P>
The same advice goes to his army. Washington, hoping to separate the general 
from his military, says the army has a role in a democratic Panama. It warns 
troops not to obey Noriega in any adventure against U.S. forces. Perhaps 
sensing declining support, Noriega is expanding his "dignity brigades" -- 
largely composed of the unemployed laced with police in mufti. They provided 
the goon squads that brutally beat and killed opposition leaders and 
demonstrators after the aborted election. 
</P>
<P>
In reviewing its options, the Administration must keep its eye on the goal: an 
open, efficiently operating canal anchored in the existing treaty and supported 
by a democratic Panama. Congress is tempted to set the treaty terms aside. 
Under these terms, as of Jan. 1, the chief operating officer of the canal is to 
be a Panamanian proposed by Panama. Noriega submitted the name of a crony in 
July. The United States refused even to accept the letter. 
</P>
<P>
This is a diplomatic dilemma with a time fuse. The appearance of illegality on 
the part of the United States can only help Noriega. His capacity for mischief 
is enormous. The threat of armed action or sabotage would send insurance costs 
skyrocketing and cut canal shipping to a trickle. Washington has less than four 
months to rally its friends and devise a plan.

TIME FOR AMERICA TO SET NATIONAL EDUCATION NORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Alone among advanced nations, America has no explicit national educational 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Our uniqueness stems from the country's nearly mythic attachment to "local 
control." Deeply embedded in the American experience, the Constitution's 10th 
Amendment -- the "reserve powers clause" -- specifically reserves to the states 
any powers not expressly given to the national government: Education is a case 
in point. 
</P>
<P>
That is why California's landmark 1976 Serrano decision, which mandated equal 
funding for all students, was decided on state rather than federal 
constitutional grounds, and why federal education programs are "conditional." 
States and localities are free to accept or reject federal money. The price of 
the gift, however, is compliance with federal standards -- no program, no 
money. Uncle Sam can't require states to withhold driver's licenses to students 
who drop out, except by threatening to withhold highway funds. 
</P>
<P>
As powerful as law is custom: Americans have controlled schools locally for two 
centuries, and most people think it is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
But do these old ways make sense in the closing decade of the 20th Century? Can 
we have a vigorous economy -- and a functioning democracy -- if levels of 
educational attainment are inconsistent and variable across the country? 
</P>
<P>
With such conditions the United States is virtually alone in the developed 
world. From France to Japan to the Soviet Union to Britain, we are confronted 
by countries that have decided their futures can only be secured with national 
educational standards. What does this mean for America as we look to an 
increasingly competitive, global economy? 
</P>
<P>
Six years after the release of "A Nation at Risk," the stinging report by the 
National Commission on Excellence in Education, the question of national 
standards for the United States is finally being taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Education's National Assessment of Educational Progress are 
national tests that produce the "nation's report card." And make no mistake, 
tests determine curriculum. Overseen by a nonpartisan, blue-ribbon panel, the 
National Assessment is meeting its responsibilities quietly and well. 
</P>
<P>
At the state level, more and more governments are establishing and imposing 
standards on their schools, describing and defining what it is students should 
know as a condition of graduation. California is in the forefront of this 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
But an "education president" notwithstanding, school reform has moved at a 
glacial pace. And while we have been prevaricating, the Europeans have been 
getting the jump on us. 
</P>
<P>
1992, when members of the Europe Economic Community remove national trade 
barriers and create an economic superpower, is not far off, and one of the most 
important signs is unfolding in Brussels -- not the European Parliament, but 
the European Round Table of Industrialists. It recently published "Education 
and European Competence." 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the document without precedent in Europe, so is its source, a 
genuinely pan-European organization. And the industrialist members are 
committed to an integrated Europe. Not surprisingly, such a vision goes beyond 
central banks and border checkpoints. It involves the essence of modern 
economies: the work force, and the skills possessed -- or not possessed. 
</P>
<P>
In this, the European industrialists have taken some pages from the American 
book, through the work of the American Committee for Economic Development, the 
Business Roundtable and the National Alliance of Business. First, they meet not 
as industry representatives but as chief executive officers concerned about the 
future of Europe. And like their American counterparts, they think education is 
the top domestic priority. 
</P>
<P>
Second, they recognize that if there is to be a new Europe after 1992, there 
must be education for Europeans -- not Frenchmen, Germans or Belgians, but 
Europeans. At a national level, it is not a novel idea. Without exception, 
government-supported education -- including compulsory attendance -- was a part 
of 19th-Century nation-building. Schools provided a national glue, creating 
Frenchmen, Englishmen or Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the issue was cast in terms of language as well as 
curriculum: French in France, German in Germany, English in Britain. It was the 
same in the United States: Noah Webster's "American Dictionary of the English 
Language," published in 1828, was explicitly designed as a tool of 
nation-building. American usage -- "labor" rather than "labour" -- 
distinguished us from the English, and Webster was proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
And while we tend to think of modern schooling in less chauvinistic terms, the 
underlying idea is still correct. E.D. Hirsch's book "Cultural Literacy" makes 
the point that as a nation we need a common vocabulary, shared knowledge that 
makes it possible for us to communicate with one another. 
</P>
<P>
What does the European Round Table call for as "European education?" Not the 
lowest common denominator that so much American education has succumbed to, but 
what may be regarded as the highest common denominator. 
</P>
<P>
Building on the highest standards of 12 countries that make up the European 
Community, the round-table group calls for "competencies" that are breathtaking 
by American standards. For example, to earn a baccalaureate degree -- 
equivalent to a good high school diploma -- the group proposes that students 
master not one, but three languages. The United States would have to go some to 
match that, since half of America's students aren't literate in even one 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts concerned about the quality of American education have compared 
us with the Japanese, and the comparison is daunting: The top 5% of American 
math students score at the Japanese average. 
</P>
<P>
The hard fact of the global, knowledge-intensive economy is that we are 
surrounded by countries that take education much more seriously than we do, 
countries that are not afraid of setting high standards and insisting that 
their youngsters meet them. Unless we are willing to concede the future to 
them, it is time we do the same.

IN SOVIET ARMS TALKS, U.S. TAKES TROUBLING STANCE ON 'STEALTH' MISSILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and Soviet Union are again involved in diplomatic 
negotiations with momentous implications for the security of our country. 
</P>
<P>
On one key issue, the Bush Administration has so far taken a position not only 
open to serious challenge, but which could put our entire national security 
planning at risk. 
</P>
<P>
The objective of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, commonly known as START, 
is to negotiate a reduction in the number of strategic nuclear weapons of each 
superpower, along with other measures designed to reduce the likelihood that 
such weapons would ever be used. Unfortunately, although our country will 
almost certainly be better off with a START treaty than without one, it is 
possible that START may fail to limit a new, troubling and most dangerous 
nuclear-weapon system -- the nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile, or 
SLCM. 
</P>
<P>
The SLCM is a nuclear-armed missile much like a miniature pilotless jet 
airplane. When launched from the torpedo tube of a submerged submarine, a 
rocket motor propels it to the ocean surface and into the air. After it reaches 
a high enough speed, the rocket motor falls off, wings that are folded into its 
body are deployed, a miniature jet engine is turned on and it begins 
jet-powered flight toward its target. 
</P>
<P>
In part because SLCMs are so small and move relatively slowly, they are 
maddeningly difficult to detect with radar or other types of sensors. They are 
also difficult to detect because they can avoid radar by flying close to the 
ground, do not emit much heat or make large amounts of noise, and if observed, 
might well be confused with small aircraft. For all practical purposes, current 
U.S. early-warning systems have no ability to detect the launch, approach and 
overflight of SLCMs. 
</P>
<P>
Thus if the Soviet navy took reasonable operational precautions, a single 
submarine off our coast could potentially launch tens of SLCMs without our 
knowledge. Some of these SLCMs could fly circuitous paths to nearby targets 
while others fly more directly to distant targets. All missiles could then 
arrive at their targets within a minute or so of a predetermined attack time. 
</P>
<P>
How seriously should we take this threat of sneak attack from Soviet SLCMs? Its 
importance or plausibility should not be exaggerated. It would not be easy for 
the Soviets to pull off such an attack. Depending on circumstances, their 
submarines might have to spend hours, days or even weeks taking up positions 
for a properly timed attack, an operation that could hardly appeal to Soviet 
leaders if they were attacking in the first place because they feared imminent 
U.S. attack. It can therefore be argued that such worries about an SLCM sneak 
attack are overstated and inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Yet my experience with similar military planning concerns leads me to predict 
that our military will take the threat of such a sneak attack seriously. They 
will adapt U.S. operations to attempt to compensate for it, they will spend 
money to defeat it and they will adjust assessments of U.S. nuclear-force 
capabilities to take it into account. Their concerns will also grow as Soviet 
SLCMs improve in stealth and range. 
</P>
<P>
This situation closely parallels that of 20 years ago when we failed, during 
the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, to stop the Soviets from placing multiple 
warhead payloads on their gigantic land-based missiles. This failure is a 
tragic example of a national security decision that decreased America's 
military security. The record of Soviet and U.S. discussions during SALT 
suggests that this objective might well have been within the reach of U.S. 
negotiators. However, the Joint Chiefs of Staff could not be convinced that 
such an arrangement was in the military interest of the United States, and a 
previous decision in the Johnson Administration to test U.S. multiple warhead 
missiles created a labyrinth of obstacles that could not ultimately be overcome 
by those involved with the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
A consequence of these oversights was a vast expansion in the number of highly 
accurate Soviet land-based warheads. Today our military planners worry deeply 
about the possibility that the Soviets could use all these additional warheads 
to preemptively destroy our land-based missiles. Unlike most of the 
unpredictable events that befall us in our precarious attempts to chart our 
nation's future, this outcome was predictable and could well have been 
prevented. 
</P>
<P>
Although images of thousands of Soviet ballistic missile warheads coasting over 
the North Pole toward our land-based missiles seem both fantastic and beyond 
comprehension, our country's military establishment has been in near crisis 
over this theoretical possibility for more than a decade. We have tried to 
solve the vulnerability problem of our missiles with proposals to build 
thousands of shelters in which a few missiles might be hidden, a system called 
Multiple Protective Shelters; by bunching our missiles together so closely that 
warheads attacking one hardened missile shelter would damage other attacking 
warheads, a system called Closely Spaced Based MX, and now we are arguing over 
the merits of deploying a new mobile small missile that has the astonishing 
virtue that it does not have multiple warheads. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has not yet finished deploying the B-1 Bomber, a program that 
will have a total cost well in excess of $30 billion, and there are news 
reports that suggest that the B-2 bomber program could well cost more than $70 
billion. Yet a single properly positioned SLCM-armed Soviet submarine operating 
off our coast will hold the potential to destroy most, if not all, of these 
forces on the ground -- and without warning. Hence, one of the major objectives 
of START should be to negotiate measures that will protect our investment in 
these forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has similar incentives to negotiate with the United States to 
eliminate these troublesome weapons. They also could be susceptible to a 
nuclear sneak attack from U.S. SLCMs. Launched from a single submarine near the 
northern coast of European Russia, nuclear SLCMs could destroy all Soviet 
early-warning radars in European Russia. In addition, bomber bases and command 
posts throughout European Russia, and even Moscow itself, could be readily 
destroyed in such a SLCM sneak attack. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have reportedly expressed concerns about SLCMs in the START talks, 
and have proposed that compliance with SLCM limitations be verified by using a 
system of monitoring comparable with that now being used to verify the 
Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. Verification procedures proposed by the 
Soviets would include continuous on-site inspection and monitoring of ships at 
nuclear loading facilities. However, the United States has so far been 
unwilling to discuss the issue, arguing that controls on nuclear SLCMs cannot 
be verified. 
</P>
<P>
It is highly unlikely that this argument for the U.S. position is correct. 
Although the nuclear sea-launched cruise missile is small, it is one of the 
largest objects loaded onto U.S. warships. It is sealed with its warhead in a 
canister that is not supposed to be accessible at sea, and it has a warhead 
that can be detected by nearby monitoring equipment, assuming proper provisions 
for inspections are negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Once nuclear SLCMs are loaded into their launchers on U.S. surface ships or 
submarines, there is no equipment for removing them or tampering with them 
while the ships are at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Hence a system of verification provisions that included monitoring of loading 
docks where naval nuclear missiles are handled, and occasional challenge 
inspections of warships, has great potential to make it possible for both sides 
to verify agreed-upon controls on nuclear-armed SLCMs. 
</P>
<P>
The stunning changes in Soviet diplomatic attitudes that have accompanied the 
rise of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and the persistence of the Reagan 
Administration, have put our START negotiators in a most enviable position. 
They can now negotiate a web of intrusive and revealing inspection procedures 
that should make it possible to uncover subtle inconsistencies in Soviet 
weapons-handling procedures. There is every reason to believe that verification 
provisions designed to detect very small numbers of nuclear-armed SLCMs are not 
beyond the reach of START, or a follow-on START treaty. 
</P>
<P>
If the Bush Administration does not address the issue of nuclear-armed SLCMs in 
START, many long-sought and vital objectives of U.S. security planning could 
well be put in jeopardy.

YOSEMITE: A RETURN TO NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Creation of the Yosemite National Park management plan in the 1970s was one of 
the most exciting events in the history of natural-resource planning in 
America. The federal bureaucracy reached out to environmental and user groups 
and the general public in a remarkable effort to find out what the people 
wanted in their park. The result seemed clear: They wanted to reduce 
development and auto traffic in Yosemite Valley and restore the core of the 
park to a condition as close to natural as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Adopted in 1980, many of the major goals of the general management plan were to 
be achieved by the 100th anniversary of the park, which will be celebrated a 
year from now. Of primary importance was the virtual elimination of the private 
auto from congested Yosemite Valley, to be replaced by buses that would shuttle 
visitors and their gear into the valley from its eastern gateway at El Portal, 
15 miles away on a winding two-lane highway. Other major objects were to reduce 
overnight accommodations in the valley by 17% and to relocate as many 
structures as possible to El Portal. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is 1989 and, as any visitor to the valley can see, the visionary goals 
are far from reality. In fact, the National Park Service does not see a 
dramatic reduction in private auto use in the valley for at least another 
decade. How it is to be achieved even then is not particularly clear at the 
moment. Valley accommodations remain at the same level as in 1980. And nearly 
1,500 park service and concessionaire employees still live in the crowded 
valley. This news comes in a 42-page status report just released by acting 
Supt. B. J. Griffin. It is disappointing news to conservation groups that had 
ardently supported the 1980 plan. One Wilderness Society official said it seems 
that the Park Service is not really dedicated to the goals of the master plan. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, declares the Park Service in the planning report. "The National Park 
Service is committed to fulfilling the basic vision of the 1980 (plan) and its 
prescriptions for Yosemite in order to preserve the park's spectacular natural 
and scenic wonders for present and future generations." The Park Service should 
be taken at its word, but in fact, only strong action by the national 
Administration and Congress can make fulfillment possible. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 plan was adopted just a year before the Reagan Administration took 
office and dramatically switched park policy from resource protection to 
construction of user-oriented facilities, including highways. The nature of 
park usage has changed, too. There are more day visitors driving in from new 
tourist accommodations in the Sierra foothills just outside the park. Visitors 
who stay in the valley usually leave their cars parked and walk, bike or take 
shuttle buses during the day. More people are coming in by tour bus. More are 
visiting the park during what once were the off months of December to March. 
</P>
<P>
And some portions of the management plan were strong on vision, but lacked 
realistic foresight. The movement of employee housing to El Portal has begun, 
but that in itself will create more traffic on the El Portal Road until 
adequate buses can be put in use. Many visitors rebel at the idea of leaving 
their autos outside the park and relying only on shuttles for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the new report is correct in saying that there now is less noise, less 
traffic and less air pollution in the valley through the incremental traffic 
management and relocation programs that have been achieved. The management plan 
has not failed. It remains in force. The challenge now is for the park service, 
the park concessionaire, Congress, environmental groups and the public to renew 
their commitment to a more natural, less congested Yosemite Valley.

SIMENON: NO MYSTERY TO HIS FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ernest Hemingway avidly read Georges Simenon for serious diversion and Thornton 
Wilder thought him a rare master of the narrative art. Andre Gide believed he 
was "perhaps the greatest and most genuine" French novelist of his period. And 
Jean-Pierre Sanguy, director of the Paris police, describes Simenon's most 
famous character, Inspector Maigret, as "a lesson of classic discipline in his 
investigations and humanity in his contacts." 
</P>
<P>
Their sentiments were shared by readers in 40 countries, who over the years 
purchased more than 600 million copies of books by the Belgian-born author who 
died last week at the age of 86. 
</P>
<P>
Simenon's status as the best-selling writer in history was assured not only by 
his gargantuan output -- 84 Maigret books, 136 so-called "psychological 
novels," lengthy memoirs and more than 1,000 articles and short stories -- but 
also by his work's engaging qualities. However, among non-Francophones, he 
doubtless will be remembered most for the unforgettable Maigret. 
</P>
<P>
That most formidable agent of 36 Quai des Orfeveres would not be displeased, we 
think, if we were to suggest that something interesting can be deduced from the 
fact that the world's most popular works of literary imagination are mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
Our century, after all, has been marked by a general increase in knowledge and 
a general decline in understanding -- by the death of the universal 
explanation. Except around the fundamentalist fringes, there is little thought 
of any kind that people of earlier times would recognize as orthodox. 
Historical consciousness has altered religion's approach to revealed truth; 
Marxism, capitalism and Freudianism offer insight and methodology, but no final 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
Against such a backdrop, what is a mystery novel but a fictional affirmation of 
the idea that, out of facts, however puzzling, understanding may emerge? And 
who are Maigret and his creator but the Enlightenment's faithful children, 
artful pleaders that reason itself not be sent to stand among the gods that 
failed.

In the overview "War Turned Impoverished U.S. Into a Superpower" (Aug. 31), 
Stanley Meisler notes: "Some Americans feared that unemployment and depression 
would return after demobilization of the armed forces." 
</P>
<P>
I think at this point he should have mentioned that it was just this thinking

I followed with avid interest your series on "The War in Europe: A 50-Year 
Legacy" (Part I, Aug. 27-31, Sept. 1) which evoked memories of my own 
experiences that summer of 1939. The bicycle trip that Rep. James McClure 
Clarke, took, as reported on Aug. 31, and the aftereffects of being stranded 
when war was declared were similar to those of other students who naively 
assumed that war would never occur. We had not been exactly brainwashed but, 
after all, we were aware of the Briand Peace Pact and there was always the 
League of Nations which would intervene, so we assumed. 
</P>
<P>
My own mission was to visit relatives in Paris and then go on to Venice, Italy, 
in pursuit of research material I had begun in college. What startled me, 
during my first week in Paris, was to see on prominent display in window shops 
various gas masks for men, women and children of all ages and sizes! Then when 
the headlines screamed "Mobilization Generale," my uncle shoved me into the 
last train out of Paris for points north with a group of soldiers bound for 
Amiens, ostensibly to defend the Maginot Line. 
</P>
<P>
In Boulogne, facing the White Cliffs of Dover, a couple of other students and I 
found a driver with whom we fled across France, Belgium and Holland to catch a 
ship, the Statendam, bound for home, i.e., New York City. We skirted many roads 
that were blocked with trees and makeshift paraphernalia and on the Atlantic, 
we plucked up survivors from torpedoed ships. Many Americans were not so 
fortunate and were stuck in various parts of Europe for several months. And one 
of my classmates was on the Athenia. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan had never looked so good. I blessed my guardian angel and dedicated 
myself to the war effort as a junior editor in the Office of War Information.

Helen Shaver stars in the new TV movie Mothers, Daughters and Lovers (NBC 
Sunday at 9 p.m.) as a single working mother trying to make a decent life for 
herself and her two daughters, despite the burning desire of the eldest 
daughter (Laura Perry) to leave their small town. Claude Akins co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
Thunderboat Row (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), another new TV movie, finds Chad 
Everett and Jason Adams in an action-adventure involving law enforcers using a 
new high-speed boat to catch drug smugglers off the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
Love Child (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.), the 1982 film that marked Amy 
Madigan's theatrical film debut, always seemed better scaled for TV. Madigan is 
excellent as a pregnant Florida convict, determined to keep her unborn child, 
and so is Beau Bridges as the likable but unscrupulous guard she refuses to 
identify as the child's father. 
</P>
<P>
Report to the Commissioner (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), a violent, 
farfetched but fast and pungently atmospheric 1975 thriller set in Manhattan, 
stars Michael Moriarty as a distraught rookie cop assigned to undercover work 
on the Times Square narc beat. 
</P>
<P>
CBS repeats The Man in the Brown Suit (Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a diverting Agatha 
Christie mystery starring Stephanie Zimbalist as the adventure-hungry heroine, 
Anne Beddingfield. 
</P>
<P>
Robert De Niro won an Oscar as boxer Jake La Motta in Martin Scorsese's Raging 
Bull (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), one of the best films of the decade. De 
Niro's La Motta is in the classic mold: the street kid who came up from 
nothing, caught the brass ring and lost it, largely through ungovernable rage 
and jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
Fire and Rain (USA Network Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is a new cable TV movie that 
dramatizes the crash of a Delta Airlines flight at the Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport 
in 1985. The cast includes Tom Bosley, Robert Guillaume, Susan Ruttan and David 
Hasselhoff. 
</P>
<P>
Tough Enough (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a delightful, modest little 
piece of Americana starring Dennis Quaid as a struggling country 
singer-composer who in desperation enters a Toughman Contest, one of those 
amateur boxing contests. Written by John Leone and directed by Richard 
Fleischer, this 1983 release is a surprising, subtle and amusing consideration 
of the seductiveness of the pursuit of macho. 
</P>
<P>
Zoot Suit (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.), Luis Valdez's 1981 film of his play, 
is not as exciting as it was on stage but is just as important. At once an 
exuberant period musical and seething courtroom drama in which the ugliest 
prejudice is laid bare, it stars Edward James Olmos as the ultimate mythical 
zoot-suiter El Pachuco. 
</P>
<P>
Under Norman Jewison's direction, Sylvester Stallone is terrific as a Jimmy 
Hoffa carbon in F.I.S.T. (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.). 
</P>

Hell's Angels (AMC Sunday at 1:45 p.m., again at 10 p.m.): Howard Hughes'

Though it may not rank with "Miami Vice" or "In the Heat of the Night," I find 
"Hunter" to be a well-written, well-acted and fast-moving series. Fred Dryer is 
excellent, as is Stepfanie Kramer.

LOTTERY WINNER'S VICTIM WANTS HIS MILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last year was a turning point in the lives Becky Rasnick and Raymond 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a 20-year-old fast-food worker from West Los Angeles, won $5.86 million 
in the California Lottery. Rasnick, a 28-year-old Ventura homemaker, was 
sexually attacked on the rural path where she jogs almost every day. 
</P>
<P>
What brought them together is that Wilson has admitted that he was Rasnick's 
attacker. 
</P>
<P>
Now Rasnick and Wilson are confronting each other. Rasnick and her husband Ben 
have sued to deprive Wilson, who was convicted of the attack, of his lottery 
prize. If they win, the Rasnicks could receive $234,400 a year from Wilson's 
winnings, which they say they would use to fight abortion and pornography. 
</P>
<P>
For the Rasnicks, the suit has become a moral battle. Deviant sexual behavior, 
legalized gambling, a liberal justice system -- to the traditional Rasnicks, 
Raymond Wilson symbolizes America gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
For Wilson, who says he became a voyeur after being sexually molested as a boy, 
the Rasnicks' suit could jeopardize his best shot at redemption. Now serving a 
one-year sentence in the Ventura County Jail for attempted rape, Wilson was 
ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment and had planned to use his lottery 
fortune to cover the cost of his therapy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Keep Track of Winners 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials said they were unaware of any other millionaire winner who 
had been convicted of a felony, although the commission does not keep track of 
its winners. 
</P>
<P>
A victory for the Rasnicks would be devastating to Wilson, whose lawyer, James 
Farley of Ventura, said his client is remorseful. Farley also suggested that 
the unusual case blurs the lines between winners and losers, victims and 
survivors, and poses a question of justice. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you express remorse, and how much is enough?" Farley asked. "There are 
always two sides to every story." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's Jan. 21 attack on Becky Rasnick was a violent aberration in an 
otherwise secure and tranquil life. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest of three children, she grew up among dozens of cousins and in the 
fold of the Missionary Church, an outgrowth of the Mennonite movement whose 
founders in Ventura County include Rasnick's relatives. Her uncle, Rev. John 
Cherry, established the county's first Missionary Church in downtown Ventura; 
her father, contractor Gene Cherry, moved from Illinois to build it. 
</P>
<P>
Rasnick attended church three times a week and lived comfortably, supported by 
the family owned Cherry Construction Co. She graduated from Buena High School 
and enrolled at Cal State Northridge, majoring in communications. There, she 
began dating Ben Rasnick, three years older, who grew up in the same Ventura 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Becky married Ben at the age of 19 in a ceremony performed by her Uncle John. 
She left college, and two years later, at the age of 21, became a mother. 
Today, she and Ben live with their two sons, Nathan, 6, and Dustin, 4, in a 
large, New England-style home custom-built by the family business. 
</P>
<P>
Everything in the immaculate home speaks of family, tradition and security: the 
living room's Yankee blue carpet and lace curtains, the wedding album on the 
coffee table, the calming whir of the clothes dryer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Left for a Run 
</P>
<P>
On the Saturday that Becky was attacked, her husband, an electrical engineer, 
was mowing the lawn. She started on her regular 5- to 7-mile course up Foothill 
Road, past lemon and avocado trees, about 5:30 p.m., later than usual because 
so many friends had visited that day. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes into the run, Rasnick said, she noticed Wilson standing by his 
truck but she kept running because motorists often park along Foothill to pick 
lemons or watch sunsets. As she passed, the man began to run after her. Rasnick 
looked back, and saw that his pants were open and the man was masturbating. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Wilson accosted Rasnick as she ran into the middle 
of the road and called for help. He pulled her into a drainage ditch, pushed 
her down, and tried to pull off her blue shorts. During the struggle, Wilson 
grabbed Rasnick by the throat with both hands, and she began to lose 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
"I was blacking out," Rasnick said in an interview. "I couldn't breathe for the 
longest time. I thought my life was over, I really did." 
</P>
<P>
Rasnick said she broke free when a passing van distracted Wilson. She flagged 
down a car and the two women inside took her home. Ben was still mowing the 
lawn, and the boys were playing outside when the car pulled up and Becky 
tumbled out, bruised and frightened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trace License Number 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was arrested Feb. 10 after police used his truck's license plate number 
to trace him to his Santa Monica apartment. Four months earlier, on Oct. 12, he 
had won a Lotto Quick Pick jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
Although he pleaded guilty to attempted rape on June 12, Wilson maintains that 
he never meant to rape or otherwise hurt Becky Rasnick -- he just panicked when 
she began screaming. 
</P>
<P>
According to a pre-sentence report by the Ventura County Probation Department, 
Wilson, an only child, was sexually abused by a male baby sitter when he was 4 
or 5 years old and had been obsessed with sex ever since. Over the last two 
years, he developed a habit of driving around and staring at women -- "a 
peeping Tom on wheels," as he called himself. 
</P>
<P>
As Wilson described his childhood in court records, his father was an alcoholic 
meat cutter who lived with the family intermittently and abused his mother. 
Wilson recalled that his mother threatened to abandon him whenever he wet his 
bed and that she thought "everyone was too dirty or bad." 
</P>
<P>
A high school dropout, Wilson obtained a high school equivalency diploma in 
1987. He worked sporadically at menial, low-paid jobs. A county report said he 
had "very low self-esteem, a history of rejection and no friends." 
</P>
<P>
In his statement to the court, Wilson said, "I found masturbating to be the 
best thing in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson declined to be interviewed. Farley, his lawyer, said he feared being 
portrayed "as some kind of monster." Farley said he believes Wilson's version 
of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what they think," Farley said of the Rasnicks. "They think Ray is going 
to be roaming around looking for victims. I don't believe that to be the case." 
</P>
<P>
Two psychologists -- one hired by Wilson and one by the county -- concluded 
that Wilson is a deeply troubled voyeur but no rapist. Prison would not change 
his behavior, but he could benefit from long-term therapy, the psychologists 
told probation officials. Probation officers noted that Wilson had no criminal 
record. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 10, Ventura Superior Court Judge Charles McGrath sentenced Wilson to 
five years' probation, although the prosecutor on the case had asked for a 
prison term of up to six years. He ordered Wilson to get therapy as a condition 
of probation, to register with the state as a sex offender and to serve one 
year in the Ventura County Jail. Farley said Wilson should be free by next 
April. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Intentions Were Bold' 
</P>
<P>
The Rasnicks said they are outraged by the short sentence. "When she came home 
I could count the fingernail marks on her neck," Ben Rasnick said. "There's no 
innocence in that. His intentions were bold, whatever they were." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was angry that Wilson's lottery winnings enabled him to hire an 
expensive defense attorney and psychologist. Wilson was also able to meet bail 
set at $20,000 and, to the Rasnicks' dismay, began working at a Carl's Jr. 
restaurant in Ventura, where they take their sons every Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
In March, while out on bail, Wilson bought a house in Tarzana for $605,000. 
Meanwhile, Becky Rasnick said she was having nightmares and panic attacks in 
the wake of her assault. 
</P>
<P>
The Rasnicks said they deserve the money to offset the cost of Becky's 
continuing therapy,but they said they would use most of the money to fight for 
what they believe are moral ills. 
</P>
<P>
A verdict that gives all of Wilson's money to the Rasnicks "could totally wipe 
out everything Ray has, leaving him broke" and unable to pay for the therapy he 
needs, Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for them both," Farley said of Rasnick and Wilson. "They both 
have their burdens to tote around."

FERRARO FAULTS MAYOR'S AIDES IN ATTACKING TUTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mayor's office is offering "a weak defense" by attacking City Controller 
Rick Tuttle for reporting that Mayor Tom Bradley attempted to interfere with an 
audit of a controversial African task force, Los Angeles City Council President 
John Ferraro said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle "showed a lot of courage and stamina to conduct this investigation and 
put forth his report," said Ferraro, who noted he had met with the controller 
on Friday. "It is not easy to criticize a colleague. I think Tuttle used good 
judgment. To accuse him of political motives is wrong. Let's face it, this is 
not a pleasant thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extremely Inappropriate' 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, who ran unsuccessfully for mayor against Bradley in 1985, was 
responding to charges by Deputy Mayor Michael Gage that the controller's report 
was "troubling, unfounded and political on its face." Tuttle said after a 
nearly five-month review of the Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations 
that efforts by Bradley and his staff to "influence" the outcome of the audit 
were "extremely inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has denied that he tried to interfere with the audit process. 
</P>
<P>
The audit concluded that the head of the task force, Bradley associate Juanita 
St. John, owes the city $260,000 in taxpayer funds and that she commingled 
public and private money in bank accounts. A separate police investigation of 
the task force is focusing on whether city funds were illegally transferred 
into the accounts of a real estate investment in which Bradley and St. John are 
partners, according to sources close to the probe. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, Ferraro appeared with Bradley at a tree-planting ceremony 
in Griffith Park. The mayor -- who has been under investigation by the city 
attorney's office since April for possible conflicts of interest involving his 
business dealings with associates, including St. John -- refused to comment on 
the controller's report. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to wait another few days until the city attorney's report is ready," 
Bradley said Saturday, clearly disturbed by reporters' questions. "Then you 
will hear my comment." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley spent most the hourlong ceremony cheerfully greeting hikers in the 
park, posing for photographs and chatting with 24-year-old actress Claire 
Yartlett, the host of the event who is better known for her role on the 
nighttime television soap opera "The Colbys." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor received warm applause when he was introduced to the crowd of more 
than 100 at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
One park visitor who received Bradley's autograph, Aurelia Singer, said she 
believes the mayor has done nothing improper. "Juanita St. John, she is the 
instigator, not our mayor," Singer said. "I believe he is in the clear and not 
guilty of anything. I love that man." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Audit Matters 
</P>
<P>
The reported attempt by Bradley and his staff to influence the controller's 
audit occurred in June when the mayor sent one of his top aides, Anton Calleia, 
to discuss three pending audit matters with Tuttle, the controller said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tuttle, Calleia demanded that auditors return a letter that 
disclosed the firing of Bradley's daughter, Phyllis, as an employee of the task 
force; withdraw a request that St. John provide her income tax returns, and 
reverse a decision to disallow part of the cost of a hotel room, charged to the 
task force account, for St. John and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Calleia later told auditors under oath that they did not attempt in 
any way to influence the audit. Both said they were only trying to make certain 
that Tuttle followed city policies on employees' privacy rights and travel 
reimbursement. The mayor and his aide have said they do not remember raising 
the issue of the inquiry into St. John's tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley told auditors that he was was trying to protect the city from liability 
when he dispatched Calleia to retrieve the letter outlining his daughter's 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor served as a board member on the Africa task force, and helped secure 
$400,000 in city funding for it since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's wife, Ethel, said in an interview Saturday that her daughter, 
Phyllis, had a leg injury and was looking for work when St. John hired her as 
an $9-per-hour office secretary in July, 1985. Ethel Bradley said she was 
uncertain whether St. John hired her daughter as a favor to the mayor. She said 
her daughter spent many idle hours alone in the task force office. 
</P>
<P>
"Phyllis never liked it," Ethel Bradley said. "Being a girl in the office all 
by yourself and no one to do anything with, it bored her. She stayed there 
longer than she wanted." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daughter Questioned 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's wife said that her daughter has been interviewed by city 
authorities as part of the task force investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Bradley could not be reached for comment. Her mother said she is 
working as a secretary in Los Angeles, but declined to give further details. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bradley added that she is bitter that her daughter's past brushes with the 
law are being publicized again in the wake of the auditor's report. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is very unfair to Phyllis," said Mrs. Bradley. "She is not a public 
figure. I'm tired of them beating a dead horse to death every time they mention 
her name. You wouldn't want that happening to your child, believe me." 
</P>
<P>
Part of a police investigation of the task force is focusing on whether funds 
were illegally transferred into accounts of a Riverside real estate investment 
firm in which St. John and the mayor are partners. Sources said that St. John 
wrote herself a $5,127 check on the task force account. The endorsement, the 
sources said, indicates that the check was deposited into the account of Kathy 
St. John II, the partnership named after St. John's daughter who works for the 
mayor's office.

GUARD GETS A ROBBERY SUSPECT AND LAPD OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fleet-footed security guard Aundra Spencer did more than chase down a fleeing 
bank robber in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday. He put himself in the running 
for a job with the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
In a turn of events that drew applause from customers at a Bank of America 
branch on West 7th Street, Spencer single-handedly caught, handcuffed and 
brought back a man who had made off with $1,020 in an early morning holdup. He 
then was handed a job application from LAPD officers who arrived at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Aundra is definitely a hero," LAPD Sgt. Bob Grant said, praising the 
29-year-old former college football player. "A lot of people would have 
definitely had second thoughts about pursuing and wrestling with a suspect they 
thought might have a gun. 
</P>
<P>
"His attention to duty and devotion to duty were outstanding -- the kinds of 
things we look for in a police officer. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The chase, which covered about a block from the bank on 7th Street to a market 
on nearby Figueroa Street, resulted in the arrest of James Ernest Davis, 44, 
who is suspected of taking part in at least 10 other bank robberies, according 
to police. Although he was unarmed when arrested, the suspect allegedly handed 
a note to the bank teller saying, "This is a holdup," before being handed a 
stack of $10 and $20 bills that he rolled and slipped into his pants pocket, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, who had seen the suspect enter the bank, remembered being struck by 
the man's "uptight" appearance and by the relatively short amount of time spent 
filling out a transaction slip. The guard, an employee of the Van Nuys-based 
Pinkerton Inc. security service, recalled glancing at the teller's face as soon 
as the man left the window. 
</P>
<P>
"She looked scared," he said. "She looked to be in a state of shock." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Spencer followed him out the door, the suspect was half a block 
away and sprinting in tennis shoes, he said. But the 6-foot-2, 230-pound 
Spencer said he hasn't lost much of his speed since he was an amateur 800-meter 
runner and football free-safety at Eastern Arizona College. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taxis 'Off Limit' 
</P>
<P>
"I can run pretty good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the suspect turned onto Figueroa, crossing the street to a line of waiting 
taxis, Spencer closed in. Two taxi drivers, seeing the uniformed guard in 
pursuit, locked their doors as the suspect tried to obtain a ride, Spencer 
said. The suspect then dashed across the street again, where Spencer finally 
caught him, punched him once in the face to subdue him and slapped on a pair of 
handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
After they returned to the bank, the suspect -- lying face down on the floor -- 
remarked, "Can I tell you something? You can run," Spencer recalled. "I 
couldn't believe this guy was . . . telling me this. A lady said, 'He was 
running fast -- but you were running faster!' " 
</P>
<P>
Spencer said he was pleased to be given an LAPD job application. But he's 
planning to enter school this fall to become an independent private 
investigator.

2-YEAR-OLD HOSPITALIZED; COUPLE ARRESTED FOR ALLEGED ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A West Covina child was hospitalized in critical condition Saturday and her 
mother and mother's boyfriend were jailed without bail in what one veteran 
officer described as the worst case of child abuse he has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's mother, Martha Araceli Alspuro, 25, and a man whom police described 
as her live-in boyfriend, Hector Ubaldo Soto, 22, were arrested after doctors 
examined the 2-year-old and said they found signs of abuse, West Covina police 
said. The detectives also indicated that the explanations provided by the two 
adults were inconsistent with the child's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The pair were being held without bail after they were arrested on suspicion of 
attempted murder, child beating, sexual perversion and sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here 19 years and I can't think of any worse case," Police Lt. Lee 
Rossman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and neighbors said no other children were staying in the house in the 
quiet, upper-middle-class neighborhood where Soto operated a gardening 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics rushed to the couple's house about 8:45 p.m. Friday after receiving 
a call that the child had stopped breathing. The girl was revived but remained 
in intensive care at Queen of the Valley Medical Center, police said. 
</P>

The couple live in a brown, single-story house where Christmas lights still 
drape from the eaves and the lawn needs mowing. Neighbors said they moved in 
about three months ago but stayed to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Montes, who lives next door, said he never heard any loud noises or had 
problems with his neighbors. He said he occasionally saw Soto playing with the 
happy, smiling toddler in his front yard. 
</P>
<P>
Montes said he asked the man one day whether he was the girl's father and was 
told that the child belonged to a cousin. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Sanchez, whose parents live across the street from the couple, said she 
once noticed the little girl standing at the front windows of the house crying. 
When she looked out again two or three hours later, the child was still crying.

The white columns that encircle the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion speak to more 
than architecture alone. As the columns seem to shoulder the graceful height of 
the building, so did ranks of men and women shoulder a hopeful notion, and then 
advanced it into something of steel and marble and music. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers, workers: hundreds, eventually, came within the Music Center's 
orbit, through small contributions or brief efforts. The seats in the Pavilion 
would hardly be adequate to hold them all. 
</P>
<P>
But a core of them stayed the course for years. They were the pioneers, people 
who enlisted on the strength of an entrancing idea proposed at a luncheon or a 
meeting, and who saw it through to reality. 
</P>
<P>
Some were people with money, some were people with optimism and ability, and a 
few had both. Their talents were artistic vision, or a skill at management, but 
most of all a love of city and of culture that made the occasional genteel 
arm-twisting for contributions an act of civic virtue. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years later, some of the movers and shakers have moved into 
retirement, and some have died. 
</P>
<P>
Of those who remain, ask one about his or her contribution, and the likelihood 
is that he will modestly say, I didn't do all that much -- suggesting you talk 
to this man or that woman. And then this man or that woman will say, No, I 
didn't really do much at all -- and suggest that you speak instead with the 
person who deferred to them in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
In the backward glance of recall, the task may seem more daunting, the millions 
an even vaster sum than they had at the time. Some speak of the Music Center as 
an organic inevitability, given the size and strength that Los Angeles was 
growing into. But for none of them, in the quarter-century since they saw their 
efforts rewarded by reality, has it dimmed to anything less than splendid. 
</P>
<P>
Following are some of their stories: 
</P>
<P>
JASCHA HEIFETZ AND William Severns were prowling through the unfinished Music 
Center in hard hats when Severns "heard a funny noise." It was Heifetz, blowing 
a tin whistle. "He kept walking around, blowing that little tin whistle. 
Finally he came back and said, 'Yes, it's going to be all right.' He could tell 
the acoustics just from that little whistle." 
</P>
<P>
Yet at the first rehearsal, Severns still wasn't sure, and Dorothy Chandler 
"was afraid to come down; she was so nervous" about the acoustics. They stood 
at the doorway, and as the orchestra began, "I think we both broke into tears 
-- just the idea that it worked." 
</P>
<P>
Severns, now 75, was the project's majordomo, general manager of the Music 
Center's operating company. He had managed the Philharmonic and the Hollywood 
Bowl before signing on at the Music Center, which some people had ridiculed as 
no more likely than, oh, a moon landing. 
</P>
<P>
Says Severns: "Frankly, nobody thought it could be done -- not the construction 
of the building or anything like that, that was fairly simple. It was the 
funding." A tease crept into his voice. "I don't know what we'd have done 
without the rubber hose." 
</P>
<P>
Born to a show-business family in the Midwest, Severns came to Los Angeles for 
the 1932 Olympics, and stayed. The city had a score of legitimate theaters, but 
by the time the Music Center project began, most had folded, the Hollywood Bowl 
had nearly gone belly-up and three Music Center bond issues had failed. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a big schism in society," between the West Side and "movie group" 
and the California Club-Pasadena contingent, who "really laid the foundation" 
for the Music Center. Once the project was underway, "then the movie people 
began to say, 'Yeah, sure, of course we want it.' But they didn't even know 
where downtown was, except when they came downtown for a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
Most everyone became a believer; "it was something the town wanted, no ands, 
ifs or buts." When the doors did open, so proprietary were those who worked to 
create it that, Severns says, "if anybody so much as dared to spill (a drink), 
put a cigarette out on the carpet, the ushers never had to say anything. 
Somebody in the public came up and reprimanded them." 
</P>
<P>
On opening night, a well-to-do lady who had devoted much time to the project 
rushed up to Severns in dismay. "Oh, Bill, this is awful," she said. "They have 
the wrong color toilet paper in the ladies' room." 
</P>
<P>
The place some had once considered "for the swells" sought democracy; new 
citizens by the hundreds were sworn in in the splendid auditorium, where the 
California State Bar held its admission ceremonies -- for a while. "The only 
problem with that was after all those new lawyers got sworn in, somebody would 
always sue," finding malice in a carpet seam or a flight of stairs. 
</P>
<P>
Two things made the Music Center possible, Severns says: Mrs. Chandler, who 
"got to like raising money." And "as more money came in, the concept got 
grander and grander and grander . . . she just never stopped dreaming." 
</P>
<P>
And the second was "the Board of Supervisors. Nobody gives those poor old 
bastards credit. If it hadn't been for their willingness to set up a joint 
powers agreement, we'd never have had it . . . no matter how much money she 
raised." 
</P>
<P>
EDWIN LESTER'S OFFICE at the Music Center -- the one he keeps "just to feel I'm 
still alive" -- is something like the keystone of an arch, a reminder that 
without Lester and the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera that he founded, the Music 
Center might not be there, at least not as it stands, nor for as long as it 
has. 
</P>
<P>
Lester is now 94. The Prometheus of West Coast musical theater, the founding 
genius behind LACLO and for 40 years its director, suffers from an ear problem 
that renders his beloved music an auditory mishmash that "annoys me as much as 
I used to love it." If surgery would help, and there was a 5% chance he could 
hear music again and a 95% chance he could die, he would tell his doctor to 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, Lester was about to move the profitable and the popular LACLO 
to the Pantages Theatre when Dorothy Chandler "came to me and said, 'We need 
you to make this opera house thing work' " to fill out a yearlong schedule and 
persuade the county to join the project. 
</P>
<P>
On his desk, Lester still keeps a copy of a report that predicts the LACLO 
would initially be making "65% of all the revenue" at the Music Center. He had 
a reputation for commercial as well as artistic success. "I knew how to operate 
and not go out begging for money. 
</P>
<P>
"If a thing couldn't support itself, it wasn't worth doing." But he adds, 
"That's not true of symphonies or grand operas anywhere in the world -- none of 
them support themselves or anywhere close to it." 
</P>
<P>
So LACLO joined the grand cause and donated $250,000; "We could well afford 
it." The money, soon outstripped by larger donations, was critical. Without it, 
Mrs. Chandler "would have managed some way, but the Music Center might have 
been a few years later. . . . The first two years, our rental really kept them 
alive. We often advanced our six months' rental to help them out of various 
spots," Lester says. 
</P>
<P>
Lester was "a frustrated singer" whose musical career halted in his youth when 
his voice gave way. When he moved to Los Angeles because of his wife's 
tuberculosis, he opened a talent agency; "I started the light opera in order to 
give my singers an opportunity to work." 
</P>
<P>
The LACLO's first Music Center show, "The King and I," had the kind of success 
that its fans had come to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt the Pavilion had a sacrosanct kind of atmosphere about it, which 
it doesn't have any more. . . . That Pavilion is generally regarded as the best 
all-round theater that has been built for grand opera, for musical shows, for 
every use. That building -- I never get tired of looking at the building." 
</P>
<P>
LET ALL THE LATECOMERS scoff and doubt -- Roy Ash is a native Angeleno, born 
within a mile of City Hall at the end of World War I, and he knew better. He'd 
seen the town change, and from the moment the Music Center project began, "I 
knew it was going to work. I know of nobody who had real apprehensions, because 
there was so much of L.A.'s leading energy committed to it. If it didn't work, 
the whole world wouldn't work." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of World War II, Los Angeles was a town on its way to becoming a 
city, but it wasn't there yet. "It's hard for you to place yourself back to 
what L.A. felt like 25 and more years ago," says Ash, a founder and past 
president of Litton Industries. "It was a little country town and the Music 
Center was a pretty sophisticated thing for our country mentality. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet after the city grew up and especially after World War II . . . we began to 
learn that the world has got more to offer this little remote country town of 
Los Angeles. And the whole idea of the Music Center was one of the first major 
reflections that culture is more than having a public library." 
</P>
<P>
Ash enlisted at the ground floor, one of the early donors of founders' money. 
"At that time, we thought $25,000 was a lot of money . . . and it was then." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond cash, "it took a lot of real solid management to put that thing into 
place," and Ash marvels at the hours volunteers still put in. "If one were to 
price in the marketplace the time given freely, at its market rate, it would be 
millions of dollars a year." 
</P>
<P>
For those whose contribution was in cash, "virtually every element of the 
community was responsive to what was arm twisting, but they were responsive." 
</P>
<P>
He downplays his own effort -- "a minor role as roles went" -- but other big 
aerospace contributors, fell into line after Ash and Litton's seed money. 
Contributors included Litton board Chairman Tex Thornton and firms such as 
Lockheed, weighing in with private and corporate contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Ash became a member of the Music Center's operating committee, and 
then spent several years as chairman of the Opera Assn., presiding over opera's 
"roller-coaster" growth from something of a cultural curiosity to "not quite a 
centerpiece but one of the main aspects" of the Music Center's repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Music Center: "I didn't know of anybody who didn't think it would 
succeed," but "we didn't realize it would do as well as it has done." 
</P>
<P>
As to the doubts about whether "there was enough -- and I'm not sure I'm using 
the word properly -- sophistication in the then-Los Angeles to give the Music 
Center and its activities the appreciation that is their due, it turns out 
there is. This is not an uncultured town at all . . ." 
</P>
<P>
THE TOP OF THE HILL, a clutch of condemned tumbledown houses, wasn't even in 
his district. 
</P>
<P>
But then-Supervisor Warren M. Dorn discussed with fellow Supervisor John Anson 
Ford that there might be a better use for the hilltop than the five-story 
parking garage that was in the works. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so shocked and aghast that they'd have this parking garage on the top of 
Bunker Hill -- it seemed like such a misuse of a precious piece of property," 
says Dorn, who now lives in Morro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Civic Center expansion plan was well along, and Dorn suggested to 
Ford, "Why don't we talk to Mrs. (Dorothy) Chandler about maybe doing the 
(Music) Center up there? 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'Why don't we contribute to the point we would donate the land?' " 
</P>
<P>
When Dorn, former mayor of Pasadena, ran for county supervisor in 1956, the 
public was in no mood to spend bond-issue money on a music center. Dorn could 
not support a publicly funded arts complex either; the county "already had it 
(a concert hall) in Long Beach, Pasadena," and "it didn't seem proper" or 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Once elected, Dorn got down to cases with the persuasive Mrs. Chandler, among 
others, and concluded that a public-private partnership might work. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of all this came finally a decision that we would put up the land and 
maintain the buildings in perpetuity, and the city would put up $2 million and 
the Blue Ribbon group would raise $2 million. Well, as you know, they raised 
over $30 million, and the city didn't give anything." 
</P>
<P>
The man Dorn chose from his district to study the feasibility of a joint 
operating agreement was Walt Disney. It was no casual selection. "Someone like 
Walt Disney saying, 'Yes, this is something the people will respond to' -- how 
can you go wrong when you have someone like this telling you it's a good thing 
to do?" 
</P>
<P>
In the end, "the public perception was that this was something good for the 
whole region, and that's why I could wholeheartedly support our participation," 
recalls Dorn, now serving as appointed chairman of the Alcoholic Beverages 
Control appeals board. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there from 1956 through 1972, and I never had any complaints about it -- 
and my district was probably the least (likely), the Antelope Valley, San 
Fernando, San Gabriel Valley," far from the city's center. 
</P>
<P>
Each time he sees the Music Center, crowning the hill above the county 
buildings, that thought strikes Dorn anew. "To me, that's where it belonged, 
like a showplace. You can see it flying in. It's such a wonderful thing, to 
have this, and not a five-story parking garage. Wouldn't that have been awful?" 
</P>
<P>
HARRYJ. VOLK WAS on his way to becoming president of Union Bank back in the 
days when the manager of the strapped Philharmonic came over to the bank on 
occasional Friday afternoons to borrow enough money to meet the payroll on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The bank had always taken a chance on Los Angeles; its founder donated his old 
homestead for the original Cedars of Lebanon Hospital. "The town was 
struggling, but there was a spark here and a desire to make it a great city." 
</P>
<P>
The proof came anew some years later when Volk joined Dorothy Chandler in her 
Music Center fund-raising effort. "There would be no Music Center -- certainly 
it would've been delayed many years -- if it hadn't been for Buff . . . You 
don't need too big a package (of stories). All you need to say is that Buff 
Chandler did it." 
</P>
<P>
But Volk's own effort came to more than Perino's lunches, where they "would try 
to convince some recalcitrant they really owed it to the community to give 
support to the project." 
</P>
<P>
"There came a time when they had a lot of pledges but no money, and 
construction was in danger of stopping," recalls Volk, now 84 and head of the 
Weingart Foundation. So Union Bank evaluated each pledge for the likelihood of 
payment and took the plunge. "We advanced the construction money secured by 
those pledges" that ran "in the millions." 
</P>
<P>
The day that bank officers assured Volk, then the president, that the bank 
could safely advance 85% on the pledges was "the day when I breathed most 
easily." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that was the point that gave me the greatest relief, and I think the 
greatest relief to Buff. I think something would have happened had we not done 
it -- I don't mean the thing would completely sustain or fail on that issue, 
some other way might have been found to do it. But at least we found the answer 
to the problem at that time." 
</P>
<P>
There were, inevitably, doom-sayers who "said the whole thing was screwy. . . . 
You've always had people like that, people against the B-2 bomber. . . . But 
despite the dragging of feet, (there are) those who believe in a goal that's 
worthwhile and are willing to devote effort and time and heart to accomplish 
it." 
</P>
<P>
For himself, "I never had any doubt but what it was going to work. I believed 
in the concept and I believed in the people." And when it was no longer 
concept, but reality, "it was almost like winning a ball game . . . I was part 
of a much larger team, and our captain and coach was certainly Buff." 
</P>
<P>
The sports metaphor suits: "When I came here, there were no professional ball 
teams, only minor league. But now we've got the Dodgers, Raiders, all those 
wonderful teams, the stadiums." And where nothing stood, there stands now the 
Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
ONE EVENING IN 1959, Charles E. Ducommun was to act as emcee at a Hollywood 
Bowl fund-raising gala "before 20,000 of my most intimate friends" and to 
accept a pump-priming contribution from piano Wunderkind Van Cliburn. 
</P>
<P>
"Van Cliburn got up and gave me this envelope, and I thought, 'Well, this is 
his check for the performance.' Then I walk offstage, and there's nothing in 
the envelope!" 
</P>
<P>
It was merely a prop, but no matter. Van Cliburn's check arrived in good time, 
as hundreds of others would. For Ducommun, who had made a second career of fund 
raising -- for the symphony ("I'd be sent out to ladies' teas"), the Los 
Angeles Civic Light Opera, the American Cancer Society -- the Music Center's 
building fund was one more worthy cause. 
</P>
<P>
Ducommun's grandfather came here in 1849 and sold hardware -- from miners' 
tools to glass eyes. In time, a family metals business flourished. Ninety years 
after the first Ducommun arrived, his grandson felt that the city had matured. 
But others thought "culture" and "Los Angeles" were an oxymoron. 
</P>
<P>
As then-president of the prosperous Light Opera, Ducommun, now 76, was asked by 
Dorothy Chandler to be a fund-raising co-chairman for the Music Center. The 
Light Opera, whose 1959 season ticket subscriptions totaled $1.4 million, was 
looking for a new home, about to lose the church auditorium it shared with the 
symphony. 
</P>
<P>
So the light opera was invited to join the Music Center. Of grand opera, 
symphony and light opera, according to a Stanford study, light opera would be 
the sure-fire moneymaker. "There was some argument" about the report, but the 
light opera signed on." 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing that happened" during his Music Center years, Ducommun says 
lightly, was when he accepted a United Nations flag on Mrs. Chandler's behalf. 
His brief speech noted that the flag "will be flown over the Music Center 
according to a protocol to be established by the Board of Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
The next day's Times headline -- "UN Flag to Fly Over Music Center," inaccurate 
in its brevity -- unleashed a John Birch Society letter-writing campaign. 
Ducommun, who in 1960 was acting local chairman of Richard Nixon's presidential 
campaign, still keeps a box of the letters, all in the vein of "how could we 
let these Communists infiltrate such a grand idea as the Music Center?" 
</P>
<P>
Ducommun eventually left the Music Center. He was an early board member and is 
still a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art . Both, he believes, 
are effort and money well spent. "It's still expensive," he says, "but what 
part of the art world isn't?"

A MUSIC CENTER CHRONOLOGY: FROM THE TRAVAILS OF EARLY ASPIRATIONS TO THE 
TRIUMPH OF TENACITY. HOW LOS ANGELES BUILT A CULTURAL SHOWPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The story of the Music Center began long before its dedication on Dec. 6, 1964. 
By 1945, arts-conscious Los Angelenos decided that the time was ripe to build a 
sports arena convention hall and a smaller pair of auditoriums for musical 
performances. An organization called Greater Los Angeles Plans Inc. raised 
money to buy two parcels of land for the halls, one at the hub of the Santa 
Monica and Harbor freeways and the other on 6th Street bordering Lafayette 
Park. Construction funding would come through a bond issue to be voted on by 
the public in April, 1951. 
</P>
<P>
GLAPI argued passionately about the need for a new music hall, since the 
existing 1,800-seat Embassy Auditorium was deemed unsuitable for music, and the 
Greek Theatre and Hollywood Bowl could only accommodate concerts in the summer. 
As the election approached, big-name endorsements poured in, ranging from hotel 
tycoon Hernando Court-wright and Father Charles Casassa, president of Loyola 
University, to Dinah Shore, Roy Rogers and Bob Hope. But Propositions A and B 
failed to receive the required votes to approve the halls. GLAPI pressed on, 
next envisioning an opera house, an auditorium and a sports arena together in a 
single giant edifice. Again, a bond issue proposing funding failed to win 
public support. In 1954, a group called Forward Los Angeles came up with 
another auditorium and exhibition hall plan. It, too, failed to win public 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Dorothy Buffum Chandler. The wife of Norman Chandler, then-publisher of 
the Los Angeles Times, she had won her stripes as a fund-raiser in 1951 by 
helping to save the bankrupt Hollywood Bowl. Now Mrs. Chandler and her friends 
turned themselves toward a new challenge: financing a hall for the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Their first fund-raising event in 1955 was the "Eldorado Party," named for the 
Cadillac raffled off. Composer John Green ("Body and Soul"), Jack Benny, Danny 
Kaye and Dinah Shore contributed their talents at the Ambassador Hotel soiree, 
and Christian Dior put on a fashion show. The $400,000 take was seed money for 
the $20 million in private financing eventually raised for the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
On June 19, 1956, the future of a music center in Los Angeles was assured when 
the Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a $50 million civic auditorium 
and music hall complex. The proposed site was bounded by Olympic Boulevard, 
Flower, 8th and Hill streets. 
</P>
<P>
July 27 
</P>
<P>
The project is temporarily shelved because of a recession and rising interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
1958 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Chandler is named president of the Southern California Symphony and 
Hollywood Bowl Assn. She promises the members that she will campaign for two 
things: a permanent musical director and a permanent home for the orchestra. By 
the end of the year, she has $600,000 in donations in the Music Center fund. 
</P>
<P>
1959 
</P>
<P>
March 19 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the county supervisors, Mrs. Chandler pledges that the Civic 
Auditorium and Music Center Assn. will raise $4 million by private subscription 
to build a new home for the Philharmonic, toward a total cost then estimated at 
$10 million. She also proposes a new site for the concert hall: a parcel of 
land bounded by Grand Avenue, Hope, 1st and Temple streets. 
</P>
<P>
July 
</P>
<P>
A 70-member Music Center Building Fund Committee is formed, with Mrs. Chandler 
as chairwoman. She sets up fund-raising headquarters at The Pub, a former pool 
house behind the Chandler mansion. 
</P>
<P>
September 4 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 20,000 packs the Hollywood Bowl for a fund-raising "Cornerstone 
Concert" featuring pianist Van Cliburn and the L. A. Philharmonic, conducted by 
Edouard Van Remoortel. "Each of us who is interested in Los Angeles, in 
California, in the United States, wishes to contribute (to the Music Center)" 
Cliburn says to the audience, then plays Schumann's "Dedication" to drive the 
point home. 
</P>
<P>
1960 
</P>
<P>
January 
</P>
<P>
After two performances of Handel's "Messiah," the Mormon Choir of Southern 
California donates a check for $25,000 to the Music Center Building Fund 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
July 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the Music Center are presented to the Board of Supervisors by L.A. 
architect Welton Becket, already well-known for design of the Pan Pacific 
Auditorium. Sketches for his new project depict a single stately pavilion 
surrounded by fluted white columns. Mrs. Chandler has a bigger vision -- to 
develop the top of Bunker Hill into a center for the performing arts with 
separate halls. Becket complies with additional renderings of a small 750-seat 
theater and another with a 2,100-seat capacity. 
</P>
<P>
November 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors unanimously approves financing plans to build the $15 
million Music Center. The county will provide $9 million, with the remaining $6 
million to be raised from private funds. Alluding to San Francisco's War 
Memorial Auditorium, Mrs. Chandler suggests that Southern California's new 
cultural center be known as "A Living Memorial to Peace." 
</P>
<P>
1961 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Chandler's Building Fund Committee extends its pledged goal to $11 million 
of a then-estimated $25 million total. 
</P>

Bombay-born Zubin Mehta, 26, replaces Georg Solti as the L.A. Philharmonic's 
conductor and musical director.

By steadily pressing wealthy Californians to support the Music Center, Mrs. 
Chandler and her committee raise $9 million, $7.5 million of that from pledges 
of $25,000 or more.

Dedication of the construction site, with President John F. Kennedy as key 
speaker, is canceled because of the Cuban missile crisis. Kennedy sends his 
regrets: "I would like to say that even in difficult times it is important that 
Americans continue to pay attention to all facets of our national life. You and 
those who are working with you have performed a notable service to the people 
of South- ern California in launching this great cultural project."

A press release from Welton Becket &amp; Associates estimates the Music Center 
cost at approximately $23 million. The Memorial Pavilion has a planned seating 
capacity of 3,200, the Forum will seat 650 and the Center Theatre, 1,700. By 
December, 1964, the estimated cost is $32.5 million, and seating capacity is 
expanded to 3,250, 750 and 2,100 respectively.

The San Fernando Valley Youth Band and Santa Monica High School Viking Band 
play the "Star-Spangled Banner" as 3,500 people look on from the Music Center 
Plaza Mall for the dedication of the Pavilion. County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn 
says: "We rejoice today because of Mrs. Chandler's vision. . . . We dedicate 
this as a Living Memorial to Peace and that everyone may have a happy, abundant 
and useful life." Bob Hope quips: "This is an ideal location -- you can have 
fine music, eat egg foo yung and catch fly balls from Dodger Stadium all at the 
same time." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Chandler can't resist one last pitch for funds and suggests that if each 
Southern Californian contributes just a dollar, the Music Center's debt will 
soon be erased ($16.5 million of the targeted $18 million had been raised by 
that point). Hundreds of spectators come forward to press dollars into her 
hands. That leads to the "Buck Bag" drive. Walt Disney designs and manufactures 
special shopping bags that thousands of volunteers tote to collect more than 
$2.2 million in donations. By December, $18.7 million in private funds had been 
raised for a total administrative cost of only $152,000. Eventually, almost $20 
million is raised in private donations. The $14.5 million balance of the Music 
Center's cost is covered by a lease agreement with the County of Los Angeles.

At last, the granite and glass Pavilion opens to the public for its inaugural 
concert. Audience members admire walls of honey-toned onyx from Mexico and 
Italian Byzantine tiles as they stroll through the foyer. In the auditorium, 
the 3,197 seats are a coral shade, and the walls are covered by butternut wood 
paneling. Parking is made simple with a garage that accommodates 2,000 cars. 
The Pavilion and Curtain Call restaurants are ready to handle hungry 
theatergoers. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous celebrities are on hand. Mrs. Chandler wears a shimmering floor-length 
Yves St. Laurent gown, and her husband is decked out in white tie and tails for 
the resplendent occasion. Tickets for this premiere are priced from $5 to $50.

Times arts critic Cecil Smith writes: "There have been at least a million words 
written on The Pavilion of the Music Center, but they seem somehow inadequate 
when one actually experiences the emotional impact of the vast new auditorium 
-- it is beyond words . . . to one who loves this city and its burgeoning 
culture, there is such an eruption of pride within the breast, button-bursting 
pride."

mural on its exterior, is dedicated. The cast of the night's West Coast premier 
of John Whiting's "The Devils" includes Frank Langella and Anthony Zerbe. 
Former actor and California Gov. Ronald Reagan gives a speech hailing the hall 
as "this beautiful temple of our profession and our art." But he walks out in a 
huff at the intermission, apparently offended by sex scenes and off-color 
language in the play about a libertine Catholic priest in the 17th Century.

<TEXT>
<P>
Most properly and most officially it's called the Music Center of Los Angeles 
County. For while it may fill a block of downtown real estate, this complex of 
buildings and people is as diverse as the county itself. A multifaceted city 
within a multifaceted county. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, one day (and part of a night) at the Music Center. Almost 
any day. Say a day last spring: 
</P>
<P>
From his Pavilion office, Music Center coordinator Roger Parrell, the liaison 
between the County and the Music Center Operating Co., scans the day's 
schedule: Pavilion -- Performance 'Orpheus," 8 p.m. Mark Taper Forum -- 
performance, "Stand Up Tragedy," 8 p.m. Ahmanson Theatre -- performance, 
"Phantom of the Opera," 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Eldorado -- Breakfast Club marketing 
breakfast (30 people), 7 a.m.-9:30 a.m. Blue Ribbon -- Pete Schabarum reception 
(200 people), 5 p.m.-8 p.m. Founders -- Coopers &amp; Lybrand lunch (40 
people), 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m. Pavilion Restaurant -- 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m., 5:30 
p.m.-8 p.m. Otto Rothchilds -- 7:30 a.m.- 11 a.m. Backstage Cafe -- 11 a.m.-8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
An arts complex with only artists? Hardly. To maintain its many cultural and 
social activities, the Music Center operates much like a self-contained city, a 
city of more than 500 citizens. Here is a glimpse at how this city functions. 
</P>
<P>
SCOTT POLLACK 
</P>
<P>
For glamour and adventure, Scott Pollack has one of the most underrated jobs in 
the complex. He commands the 17-man security force that ferrets transients out 
of stairwells, returns lost diamond broaches and keeps groupies from assaulting 
the Pavilion Artists Entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Only 22 and a captain for Burns International Security Services (contracted by 
the county), the native New Yorker looks snappy in his starched white shirt 
with badge. "Most of the work is fairly slow," he says, "but there are 
moments." 
</P>
<P>
During their post-performance lockup of the three theaters, Pollack and his men 
have found diamond watches, as well as cameras, binoculars, items of clothing 
and wallets. "Once we found a $6,000 diamond ring," he says. And once he 
discovered a homeless couple living in a Pavilion stairwell. The young man and 
woman had been there two days; the pair had set up bed and lodging. 
</P>
<P>
Last year a burglar broke into the gift shop on the courtyard. But most of the 
time there is little problem because the grounds are patrolled on a 24-hour 
basis. (L.A. County Safety Police also provide building security.) A wide-angle 
video lens sweeps the courtyard with a ubiquitous eye. 
</P>
<P>
Fans often try to con their way through the Grand Street Artists Entrance, says 
Pollack. "They will say that such and such a performer had left their name at 
the entrance, and it isn't their fault if it's lost." 
</P>
<P>
PAGE MESSERLY 
</P>
<P>
"Often we are a person's very first theater experience," says Page Messerly, 
box office treasurer for the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. "Sometimes people are 
intimidated to come to the box office. If we treat them well, they will enjoy 
theater more." 
</P>
<P>
This day, Messerly, 30, a UCLA theater-arts graduate who used to design 
lighting for Equity Waiver productions, is busy on three fronts: taking ticket 
orders for the July 1 and final performance of "Orpheus of the Underworld," 
handling advance sales for the summer Pavilion presentations of "Gypsy" and 
"Fiddler on the Roof" and doing subscription work for the 1989-90 Music Center 
Opera season (which just opened with "Tosca"). 
</P>
<P>
Messerly started in the telephone-orders room of the Pavilion four years ago, 
moved to group sales and took over as box office treasurer last year. Her 
department numbers 11 full-time staff members. 
</P>
<P>
"Just now I had to explain to a customer at the window that we are not the 
Ahmanson," Messerly says. "People often confuse our Pavilion box office with 
the other theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"Most sales, though, are not over the wicket but through ticket outlets and 
telephone and mail orders. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is communication, learning how to extract information from 
people quickly. It's a lot easier when a customer says, 'I want to see this 
show on this date and here's the money I have to spend.' It comes down to what 
price people want to spend. Some have to have a seat on the aisle. And one 
patron, when buying for the Joffrey Ballet, always sits in Row 22, insisting 
the Joffrey can only be appreciated from Row 22. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to opera, we find that word of mouth, not reviews, is 
particularly important." 
</P>
<P>
NEAL ALVAREZ 
</P>
<P>
He writes plays on the side and oversees a 130-person usher pool for all three 
theaters. "I started ushering here in '73," says Neal Alvarez. "It was a job to 
get me through college." 
</P>
<P>
Now, as supervisor of all ushers, which include ticket takers and footmen (the 
uniformly dressed personnel who work the front of the box offices), Alvarez, 
35, has a career. 
</P>
<P>
Many current, full-time Music Center employes were once ushers and several, 
Alvarez says, went on to become L.A. policemen, lawyers and judges. The most 
famous is actor John Ritter, Music Center usher class of 1969-70. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in blue blazers or gray blouses and slacks, the ushers this evening 
were moving through their post-show routines, clearing out the houses, checking 
to see that restrooms were empty, and clearing with Alvarez the next day's 
schedule for a children's drama festival. 
</P>
<P>
But ushering is not as passive as it may look. Take heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Says Alvarez: "People don't realize it, but some theatergoers are alive today 
because we're trained in CPR." 
</P>
<P>
The night before, at a soiree hosted by California Federal Savings for the 
opening of the Music Center Opera Company's "Orpheus in the Underworld," a 
patron suffered a seizure and toppled out onto the courtyard in front of the 
Pavilion. Alvarez and the house manager rushed to his side and called the Music 
Center registered nurse, Virginia Bidwell, who works full-time in a large 
first-aid room at the Pavilion. Paramedics were on the scene in less than five 
minutes. The man was saved, which Alvarez credits to a policy that ushers be 
Red Cross-trained in CPR. 
</P>
<P>
"Major illnesses are common here," says Alvarez. "When all three theaters are 
running, plus the usual tourists and strollers, you can have more than 6,000 
people here." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Los Angeles City College and UCLA, Alvarez calls ushers "the 
Music Center's unsung heroes because we are the people who represent the Music 
Center to the public." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning ushers earn $4.67 an hour, senior ushers, $5.39. Above them come head 
ushers, house managers, then Alvarez himself. 
</P>
<P>
They are highly motivated, says Alvarez. "The prerequisite is that they have to 
be students, either high school seniors or in college. They may work 30 hours a 
week -- and they get to see a lot of plays. 
</P>
<P>
Says Alvarez: "There have been 6,000 ushers here since the Center opened. 
Ushering here is an educational experience, like going to an arts college." 
</P>
<P>
DON LA PANE 
</P>
<P>
Don La Pane, director of sales for Pavilion Catering, was having a typically 
crazy day. Not only was he yanked into emergency service as a maitre d' in the 
pastry department but -- dressed in suit and tie -- he had to jump into a 
catering truck to speed deliveries to an off-the-premises party. 
</P>
<P>
Says La Pane: "This job is crazy but wonderful. Nothing is routine. What we 
really do in the catering department is run a hotel without sleeping rooms." 
</P>
<P>
Pavilion Catering, with 200 employees, not only operates all three restaurants 
-- the 200-seat Pavilion dining room, the 175-seat Otto Rothchilds and the 
205-seat Back Stage Cafe (including its 175-seat outdoor capacity) -- but also 
handles the assorted banquets, parties and private lunches that daily fill the 
Music Center culinary schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Catering is a big-budget item here. A post "Orpheus" opening-night party the 
evening before, for 400 invited guests, cost $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of downtown corporations don't even know there's food here," La Pane 
says. "I sell the Music Center as a destination. We do a lot of off-premise 
catering. No potential client will talk to you if you say you're from a 
catering company, but if you say 'Music Center' the reaction is different." 
</P>
<P>
"Our business is word-of-mouth. And our business is predicated on how 
successful the theaters are. The '88 summer was slow. But 'Phantom of the 
Opera' has changed that. The success of 'Phantom' has compelled us to bring 
back brunch at the Pavilion." 
</P>
<P>
La Pane was checking out decor, theming, flowers and entertaining for a private 
banquet in the Pavilion's Grand Ballroom: "Eight hundred man-hours can go into 
a sit-down dinner. People step into a party and don't think a thing about the 
preparation, how much must be done in a short amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
MIREYA JONES 
</P>
<P>
Mireya Jones strongly attacks the idea that volunteers are socialites with 
nothing better to do. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the best-kept secret in Los Angeles," says Jones, outgoing president of 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic Affiliates, an umbrella organization for 
volunteers at the Music Center. The group began working for the Philharmonic 
Orchestra in 1923 with a handful of volunteers and today has 2,400 members in 
22 autonomous committees. 
</P>
<P>
The group is "getting something done -- that's where volunteers want to be. 
We're not the tea-and-crumpets broads that (Ernest Fleischmann, Philharmonic 
executive vice president) expected when he came here from England," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the work done by the Affiliates is planning for the Philharmonic 
Ball, an event last year that raised $130,000. Recently, Jones, incoming 
president Frances Muir, Philharmonic Ball chairman Joan Riach, Fleischmann and 
Ann Giesler, coordinator of volunteer activities for the Philharmonic, met to 
hear progress reports on the next ball -- which will be held on the Pavilion 
stage Dec. 5, the eve of the 25th anniversary of the Music Center. Topics of 
discussion ranged from Fire Department regulations to table arrangements, from 
the labor costs of doing fund-raisers at the Music Center to the restrictions 
on fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center regulates the fund-raising activities of the resident groups, 
primarily to keep them from competing for the same funding sources. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed that it works as well as it does," Muir says of the fund-raising 
rules. "There are a lot of egos involved, and a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
TONY DOMINGUES 
</P>
<P>
When the Music Center finally goes dark, when the last lingering patron has 
left Rothchilds, a maintenance crew slips into the shadows with its mops and 
vacuums. It's 4 a.m. in the underbelly of the Music Center. In what, to the 
casual observer, seems the toughest job, a crew of janitors hauls out its 
cleaning equipment and departs to myriad way stations of grime, dust and trash. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Domingues supervises the 26 janitors. His shift, he explains, is the best 
time of day to dump the trash, scrub the restrooms, clean the offices and, once 
a week, steam clean the Plaza courtyard itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides our regular work, we have to get ready for special shows, too," says 
Domingues. "The 4 a.m. to noon shift is the most common for most of us." 
</P>
<P>
Like the ushers and guards, Domingues, spots his share of lost baubles, 
including wallets and a gold fountain pen (found in an elevator). 
</P>
<P>
But nothing in Music Center lost-and-found legend compares with a janitor's 
recent discovery at the Pavilion. There, wedged between two seats following a 
concert by the Philharmonic, was a cashier's check for $10,000. The check was 
signed and the payee line had yet to be filled in. The janitor turned it in to 
Domingues who, in turn, gave it to the security guards in lost and found. The 
man who had signed the check was able to retrieve it within hours. 
</P>
<P>
JAMES B. DOLAN 
</P>
<P>
The tools of a music librarian's trade have changed since James B. Dolan joined 
the Philharmonic the year before the Music Center was built. There are now 
computer filing systems and on-line data bases, photocopiers and fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
But the basic tasks of proofreading and collating the music that appears on the 
orchestra's racks for rehearsal and performance are still done the 
old-fashioned way -- carefully, by personal examination of every bar of every 
part. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at everything," Dolan says. "You could work 24 hours a day 
and never get caught up." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to catching and correcting the errors and putting measure numbers 
in the parts where the publisher omitted them, Dolan must see to it that 
bowings and other indications are transferred. 
</P>
<P>
He is not alone in his job. Only the fifth librarian in the Philharmonic's 
70-year history, Dolan is the first to have two assistants -- Kazue Asawa 
McGregor, wife of Philharmonic trumpeter Rob Roy McGregor, and Katherine Dolan, 
his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they are responsible for getting the correct music on the stands and, 
indeed, for obtaining the music in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
A compact man of quiet pride, Dolan has an obvious love for the scores and 
parts the orchestra does own -- many of them first editions. As Toscanini's 
librarian during a career that began in Boston in 1934, Dolan himself is a 
walking library of music lore, and his stories are filled with the likes of 
Arthur Fiedler, Leonard Bernstein and Ferde Grofe (a violist for the 
Philharmonic in its first season in 1919). 
</P>
<P>
DAVID RUBINSTEIN 
</P>
<P>
Is there a phantom in the house? Not if David Rubinstein has anything to do 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein, production stage manager for "Phantom of the Opera," was roaming 
the cavernous backstage area at the Ahmanson before a matinee. He was checking 
on myriad details -- from an actor's tardiness to ensuring that set pieces 
lowered and raised from the stage didn't bump into each other. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really about putting out fires," he says about his job. "Some days 
they're aren't any, and my crew and I are able to sit down. Then we have those 
days when there are more fires than we can handle." 
</P>
<P>
Being a man of the stage (theater graduate of Temple University, veteran stage 
manager and/or assistant director specializing in musicals ranging from "Les 
Miserables" to "Peter Pan"), Rubinstein is frankly superstitious. Ask about a 
particularly tricky technical maneuver and he'll knock his knuckles on whatever 
surface is nearby. And doing a show involving a Svengali-like phantom artiste 
who wreaks havoc to an opera house doesn't make things any easier, though it 
does make for much half-nervous joking. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll mess up," Rubinstein says, "and somebody will crack that the Phantom's 
up to his old tricks again. Rubinstein coordinates four assistants, 
communicates with crew hands posted from up in the fly to below the stage, 
keeps a watch on monitors fixed on the conductor, the stage and the huge 
chandelier set piece, and controls a switchboard for hundreds of automatic and 
manual cues . . . and he also runs weekly rehearsals for cast understudies and 
sends daily reports on the performances to "Phantom's" central New York 
production office. 
</P>
<P>
NANCY DAVIS 
</P>
<P>
"So you'll send out the financial statement for the board meeting?" Nancy Davis 
says into the telephone. ". . . OK, I'll fax the fund-raising report now." 
</P>
<P>
Davis is telephoning New York. In fact, she will talk to four people in one 
office in New York, scanning a "Weekly Minder" date book as she's transfered 
from one extension to the next. 
</P>
<P>
The Joffrey Ballet was at home for 27 years in Manhattan's City Center Theater, 
until it established a joint residency at the Music Center five years ago. 
While the now bicoastal troupe performs equally in each metropolis, many of its 
administrators spend most of their time in New York. That sets up daily 
obstacles of time and space for Davis, general manager of the Joffrey's West 
Coast operations, and her eight-person staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it is frustrating," says Davis, squooshed into an office the size of a 
large closet. She nonetheless has a window with a view of Grand Avenue 
featuring the Museum of Contemporary Art. "You might not get a call back. You 
have good days and bad days." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a former I. Magnin store manager with a chipper disposition and shiny 
blonde hair, coordinates Los Angeles activities -- fund raisers, patrons, 
ticket, advertising and publicity agencies, and the company's board of 
directors, about half of whose 73 members live in the L. A. area. 
</P>
<P>
It's not always paper-pushing. When the troupe is in town, Davis says, she and 
most of her staff watch performances every night. And, their suite of four 
small offices shares space on the fourth floor of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
with rehearsal rooms -- the click-clack of typewriters punctuates muffled 
sounds of opera singers and orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
Another of Davis' tasks: arranging a free performance of the "Nutcracker" for 
3,000 inner-city kids, made possible by a Joffrey donor. The cost of the 
gesture, she told the donor by phone, would total about $90,000 if every seat 
of the Pavilion was bought. 
</P>
<P>
"You always want to be able to meet the needs of the donor," says Davis. "This 
particular donor feels strongly about trying to find meaningful activities for 
inner-city kids. For many, this will be their first exposure to the performing 
arts. It is gratifying for me to put the right project together with the right 
donor. Also I have a sense of victory when it all works out and it's great 
knowing that the children will benefit." 
</P>
<P>
JAMES M. FLOYD 
</P>
<P>
A matinee for "Phantom of the Opera" means extra work for James M. Floyd, 
general manager of the Music Center garage. That's when he runs an extra 700 to 
800 cars. 
</P>
<P>
"When the theaters are going," says Floyd, "it's a constant flow. Every hour 
something new is going on here." 
</P>
<P>
It's 1:30 in the afternoon and cars are rumbling through the entrances for a 
matinee of "Phantom of the Opera." Floyd is out on Grand Avenue directing 
traffic for all levels (1,800 spaces). "The trick," he says, "is to keep all 
the entrances open and flowing." Across the Plaza, on Hope Street, others on 
Floyd's staff are manning valet parking. 
</P>
<P>
But Floyd's staff of 45, employed by a contracted firm called 5 Star Parking, 
has more to do than only work theater parking. 
</P>
<P>
His crew opens the underground garage at 5 a.m. to accommodate city and county 
employees. Two men work from 11 p.m.-8 a.m. doing nothing but mopping up oil 
left by leaky engines on the slick garage surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd views his job as "an adventure. It's unique because it's not routine. 
It's a job of logistics. You have to be on the alert." 
</P>
<P>
WALLY RUSSELL 
</P>
<P>
Wally Russell leaned back in his chair, sipped coffee from a paper cup and 
enjoyed the lull. "Orpheus in the Underworld" had opened two nights before and 
for the technical director of the Music Center Opera it had been two weeks of 
non-stop overtime getting everything ready to go -- the lights, scenery, props, 
audio gear . . . 
</P>
<P>
Says Russell: "The theater is like that. Very, very intense periods followed by 
a down time." 
</P>
<P>
Russell, 55, rumpled, easy-going, spoke from his disheveled, unadorned office, 
just roomy enough for a couple of large desks, a drafting table, a small 
refrigerator. Exhausted, he planned to go home at noon and dig into a mound of 
paper work piled up from his job at the opera. 
</P>
<P>
But by 10 a.m., a phone call threatened to disrupt the welcomed peace. 
"Orpheus" star Dom DeLuise may have to fly to New York. 
</P>
<P>
That would mean a rehearsal for understudy Roderick Cook, who couldn't arrive 
at the theater until 7 p.m. In addition to overseeing all technical aspects of 
production and supervising 45 people on eight productions a year, Russell is 
responsible for scheduling all activity taking place on the stage. Therefore, 
he would also have to set in motion routine preperformance technical 
preparations, make sure cast and crew were notified of the run-through, then, 
to his displeasure, stay for the evening performance to "make sure everything 
runs smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
Leaving his office located one floor beneath the Pavilion stage, he ascended 
the single flight to meet property master Carmine Marinelli. "We may have to 
throw in a rehearsal this afternoon," he told Marinelli without a trace of 
panic in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
He is used to responding to emergencies, however. 
</P>
<P>
Preparation may start as much as three years ahead of time, Russell says: 
"Someone might want to know how many shipping containers are needed for 
costumes coming from Amsterdam." Or it may mean loading scenery into the 
backstage area of the theater two days before a premiere. 
</P>
<P>
But problems -- which cause delays -- are costly. Actors, musicians and 
stagehands, all paid by the hour, go into overtime, which can total up to 
$3,000 an hour for the routine contingent of stagehands employed on a single 
production. Says Russell: "It behooves you to organize well." 
</P>
<P>
JUDITH TOWNSEND: ANNE E. WAREHAM 
</P>
<P>
In Gordon Davidson's offices, command central of the Music Center's Center 
Theatre Group, the phone never seems to stop ringing. Secretary Judith Townsend 
coolly handles the incoming barrage like an air-traffic controller. Executive 
assistant Anne E. Wareham is keeping tabs on all of the day's, and week's, 
meetings to follow. 
</P>
<P>
The trips and the office load have only increased since last September, when 
Davidson took over the artistic directorship of the Ahmanson Theatre while 
remaining at the helm of the Mark Taper Forum. By their own accounts, Wareham 
and Townsend have a handle on the additional load, which is best appreciated by 
scanning their shoe-box office. Every desk surface is covered in paper. Seven 
large file cabinets stand behind them, on top of which are stacks of produced 
and unproduced scripts. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend wears a headset "so I can keep my hands free" while answering calls. 
Eight big address card files line Townsend's desk, while Wareham has four and 
counting. (Townsend: "Each day, I add 10 new numbers and Gordon averages 25 
messages.") 
</P>
<P>
Wareham describes herself as Davidson's "lifeline between him and whomever he's 
working with." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend is traffic cop for the flurry of phone calls ("We're swamped when he's 
in, since everybody seems to know when he's in"). Perhaps even more demanding 
is maneuvering house seats for Davidson's guests. Townsend often finds herself 
having to place a takeout lunch in front of the artistic director. "Otherwise," 
she says bemusedly, "he'll completely forget about it." 
</P>
<P>
FRED STEGEMAN 
</P>
<P>
When Frank Gehry's design for the $100 million Walt Disney Concert Hall complex 
was chosen last year, it was described as "a lush garden oasis nestled among 
towers." 
</P>
<P>
When project-management consultant Fred Stegeman of Stegeman and Kastner Inc. 
heard that repeated, he was bemused. He explains that he has to think in 
somewhat more mundane terms -- "acoustics, lighting, escalation, nurses' 
stations, parking stalls and toilets." In short, Stegeman is assessing the 
"oasis" in terms of all those practicalities needed for the Philharmonic's 
future home adjacent to the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
Stegeman, a fit 51, talks about his job as "the man in the middle," responsible 
for finding out what Gehry wants, what the property owners want and what's 
possible. He ensures that the contractor makes it happen and that all parties 
are kept up to date with every development. 
</P>
<P>
"Concert halls are very expensive items and very complex," he says, "and we 
have to produce (this one) relatively fast." Although there is as yet no 
specific target date, completion may be possible for the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years, actually six, sounds like an awful long time," Stegeman says, "but 
many of these things can take nine or 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
JOHN HOWLETT 
</P>
<P>
The June morning after the Music Center Opera opened "Orpheus in the 
Underworld," the company's director of marketing and public relations was deep 
in planning the campaign for the new season in September. In the selling 
department, the future is always now. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting in John Howlett's spare, functional Music Center office covered ad 
designs for the upcoming operas and grappled with budget constraints. With 
"Tosca" and "The Rise and Fall of the City Mahagonny" opening almost 
simultaneously, are two ads necessary or can both be covered in one? 
</P>
<P>
The ads featured the phrase "L. A. Opera." Though the company is not formally 
parting with its Music Center Opera designation, Howlett finds the L. A. Opera 
concept a useful tool. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gone very quickly from non-existence to being perceived as a major 
company," Howlett says. "Now we need to be seen as friendly and as part of the 
larger community." 
</P>
<P>
Howlett himself feels very much a part of the community here, both within and 
without the opera offices. "I feel everything I've done has led to this job," 
he says. He had been vice-president for marketing at the Brooklyn Academy of 
Music, where his work on the Next Wave festivals was much what it is here, 
"basically a matter of positioning, and getting a new audience." 
</P>
<P>
Howlett's planning meeting was constantly interrupted by a flow of phone calls 
and people. 
</P>
<P>
"My job description from the beginning has been to do whatever has to be done. 
The organization is remarkably egoless in doing that," Howlett says. "The 
organzation is basically Peter (Hemmings, general manager) and everybody else. 
We all have to pull together." 
</P>
<P>
RAE MACDONALD 
</P>
<P>
In a minuscule office in a boxy trailer across the street from the Music 
Center, the telephone is ringing -- again. The woman sitting at the cluttered 
desk on this warm June afternoon apologizes for another interruption and 
politely answers, "Master Chorale, Rae Macdonald." 
</P>
<P>
Tall and cordial, with short and curly dark hair, this busy woman industriously 
marking rehearsal schedules and fielding phone calls is production coordinator 
for the Master Chorale. "Right now," she explains, "I'm re-adjusting the opera 
schedules for our January through April rehearsals so we can get our 
availability slips out and solicit singers (for the opera choruses)." 
</P>
<P>
That is part of keeping the Master Chorale's organizational wheels turning, but 
Macdonald has another formidable task: taking care of the group's 133 altos, 
tenors, sopranos and other voices. 
</P>
<P>
One day in the life of the Music Center, a day that in many ways impacted on 
the hundreds who visited and the 500 who work there. It was just one day.

"They are all dreams and somebody could say they're silly dreams, but you know 
you don't get anyplace if you don't dream."- Esther Wachtell, president, Music 
Center 
</P>
<P>
True, it doesn't cost anything to dream, and when the major dreamers at the 
25-year-old Music Center are asked to project their vision 25 years into the 
future, to the year 2014, imaginations run wild. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Davidson, artistic director/producer of the Center Theatre Group, jests: 
"They wheel me out onto the stage, I'll be pushing into middle-80s, and (say), 
'As a special reward for your long service, we're asking you, first of all, to 
retire . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Outside of that whimsical scenario, Davidson envisions a major repertory 
company of 100 players, with maybe 40 on leave at any one time, another 20 on 
tour and the other 40 performing classics on a rotating schedule, including 
such modern classics as Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" 
</P>
<P>
Another of his fantasies: "I would love it if the Music Center were the 
crucible for new musical theater. It's so important, so indigenous to who we 
are, so all pervasive in terms of music, the ability to hear it, so powerful 
and capable of cutting across all lines." 
</P>
<P>
Some look several years ahead if not exactly 25. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Arpino, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, wants a future company 
of "60-something dancers" doing two seasons of six weeks each. The company will 
be larger "because it has to be," and it must have time to develop young 
artists. "That is the threat to America," he says, "not having the luxury to 
develop the young artist, to be giving the time, not always to produce, produce 
..." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hemmings, general director of the Music Center Opera, wants a 
70-performance season within the next five years, about the same level as the 
Chicago Lyric Opera. He is most enthusiastic about that day when the 
Philharmonic leaves the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and moves into Disney Hall in 
1994 . Hemmings alludes to that day when "once the Pavilion is ours." 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Fleischmann, executive vice president and managing director of the 
Philharmonic, is convinced that the orchestra will "grow in quality because it 
will have its own home in Disney Hall to rehearse and perform as it needs." He 
hopes that the hall "will become the world focus of orchestral music . . . 
Every great orchestra has to play in London, in New York, has to play maybe in 
Vienna, to a certain extent, for its own prestige and so on. I hope to be able 
to add Los Angeles to these stations." 
</P>
<P>
Esther Wachtell says the Music Center is creating "an absolutely world-class 
product." She aims for the concept of expanding Los Angeles as a media center. 
"We would take the product that is created on these stages," she says, "film it 
-- some in live performances, others in a studio -- and then you put that into 
videos, put that on TV, on cable and you begin to bring it to more people. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting now and in 25 years we will be a media center. The first thing 
I have to find are sponsors and/or a producing company . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, all these ambitions need fueling. On the matter of money, Charles I. 
Schneider, chairman of the Music Center Operating Company, figures that the 
Music Center Foundation will continue growing. "We have about $50 million in 
its endowment," he says, "and in about 25 years probably it will be about $200 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Some people see new alliances in the future. Says Gerald Arpino: "The Los 
Angeles/New York relationship is one that's going to set a whole new 
perspective on how the arts can survive in this country, and definitely is 
going to lead to new avenues of thinking of how the arts will be able to 
support the large cities . . . All eyes are going to be looking here." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll surprise you with one comment," Charles Schneider says. "I think that you 
are going to see a much closer relationship between the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center and ourselves in years to come. I believe Orange County 
is going to grow. It's going to develop an identity of its own, and performers 
and shows that come out here are going to be given two venues, which is more 
economical. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last two years we've been working with Kennedy Center, Denver Center 
for the Performing Arts and Lincoln Center to put together a circuit of venues 
and to jointly produce shows." 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the alliance of the art forms. Gordon Davidson says that "my 
other great fantasy" is regular creative combinations of the resources of the 
Philharmonic, the opera and the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"I did an opera, 'Midsummer Night's Dream' and I'm doing 'Oedipus,' " he says, 
"but I'd love to see that happen on a regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Fleischmann says, "I also hope we can work much more closely with the 
Opera and Center Theatre Group and even with museums. I would love to involve 
visual arts supporters who are ignorant of what we do. You go to any museum 
function and there's hardly any crossover, it's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Arpino: "I see a major development of new playwrights and collaborations 
between all the theater forms." 
</P>
<P>
At the core of many visions is a sense of the need for a powerful mix of 
cultures that reflect Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Wachtell notes that such a commitment may sound grand but "the truth of 
the matter is that anybody who is at all sensitive to creativity knows that the 
thing that is great about us is that we are diverse. That is where our 
greatness is -- both the Music Center and the city." 
</P>
<P>
She thinks that the Music Center has brought all the elements of the region 
together in the past 25 years: "I don't think that Lincoln Center, as great as 
it is, for whatever reason, in the development of New York, shares the kind of 
pivotal importance in people's lives that the Music Center does here. And it's 
only because of an accident of history. It became a part of the Renaissance of 
the city in the late 20th Century. It grasped and then has held the imagination 
of the people of the city, and therefore has been able to stand as a symbol." 
</P>
<P>
But how to achieve cultural mix? Wachtell points to some current attempts: "Jim 
Rosser (president of California State University, Los Angeles), who has been 
working on the symphony board, is heading up a committee to address 
multicultural needs through music. He is bringing the Joffrey to Cal State L.A. 
and to a population that is the new Los Angeles. He is planning to work with 
Gordon Davidson and bringing work from the Taper there. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to look at Yolanda Nava on the Center Theatre Group board and Hiromoto 
Seki, the Japanese consul general, who is on our (Music Center) board." 
</P>
<P>
But fewer people from the multicultural communities are going into arts 
management. "They are coming out of an economic ghetto situation and they want 
to grasp the brass ring, and you don't do it as an arts manager," Wachtell 
says. "What we are doing is beginning to work with those arts managers who are 
coming out of Cal State Dominguez Hills and places like that who are 
multicultural and bring them in here in an internship capacity so that they can 
begin to work their way into the arts management field . . . These programs are 
going to bear fruit." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson figures that the toughest part of future-looking is trying to predict 
the nature of the society: "Yes, we will be a majority of Hispanics. That could 
profoundly alter everything we want to talk about in terms of what this 
institution can and should do. My dream is that this place be alive to the 
community, and truly doesn't act as a responder to the community but also helps 
lead." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson dreams of the rep company performing the great works of Western 
culture "but the challenge here is that we are on the Pacific Rim. I don't 
think it would be possible 25 years from now to only talk in terms of Western 
culture. I hope we could talk as comfortably and be more knowledgeable about 
Eastern culture. (And) that there is a blending. 
</P>
<P>
"Latino culture has its roots in Mayan and Aztec cultures but it also inherits 
Western forms with a Latin beat . . . The great works of Chinese, Japanese or 
Indian literature are relatively unknown to us. I think in the world of the 
future, they will be less known." 
</P>
<P>
Fleischmann sees the need for the Philharmonic "to be closely involved in the 
whole cultural change taking place in the development of various ethnic 
communities coming together here." 
</P>
<P>
He takes particular note that "classical music seems to be the one common 
factor among Asians, Westerners and, to a certain extent, Latinos. The 
classical music audiences in Japan, Korea and Mexico are enormous. There are 
more symphony orchestras per capita in Mexico than the United States. Many of 
them are government supported . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hemmings says that "what is exercising everybody here at the moment is whether 
or not it is going to be possible to attract Asian and Latin American 
immigrants to the Music Center. Because in our case, opera is basically a more 
European art form. But on the other hand opera is popular in Japan, 
particularly Western-style opera, and there was beginning to be an interest in 
China." 
</P>
<P>
Hemmings is "very keen to do operas in Spanish and to create operas in Spanish 
on South American subjects," and he wonders if those operas would attract the 
Hispanic community. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding companies, expanding seasons. Few artistic managers prefer to think 
smaller. 
</P>
<P>
The opera company, for example, sees the expanding horizons. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got to take it in several leaps," says Hemmings. "I think that 
in the next four or five years, when we shall be sharing the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion with the symphony, it will mean that our expansion is very gradual -- 
moving from eight to nine operas, possibly to 10 by the end of the period. 
</P>
<P>
"So the time will come when we go from four performances of each opera to five, 
and extra ones with very popular pieces. Then, of course, we have to be looking 
all the time to what will happen in the Pavilion once the symphony moves across 
to Walt Disney Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"And when that happens we can put on perhaps a fall season and a spring season. 
I expect we will be at the same number of performances as Chicago Lyric Opera 
within the next five years or so -- about 70. We're at 48 already and we're 
just finishing our third season." 
</P>
<P>
Hemmings doesn't endorse "a year-round, seven-performance-a-week operation." 
That doesn't work these days. "It becomes too much of a machine. Very few 
places still do that, some of the very big German houses . . . but they've got 
a ballet company as well. The only place in the United States is the Met." 
</P>
<P>
But "once the Pavilion is ours," he says, "then we would be in a position to do 
a substantial number of those weeks (that the Philharmonic had), if we've got 
the audience and the money." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a very different world," says Gordon Davidson. "And I'm not a 
futurist or crystal-ball-gazer (but) the optimist in me wants to believe that 
there will indeed be a Music Center, that it won't have succumbed to any kind 
of petrified state and not become a fossil in any way. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't make predictions about the future of symphonic music and grand opera. 
(But) I think the theater always has a chance to be vital because it does speak 
immediately to its time and place, or ought to. And certainly the world that 
we've carved out for ourselves reflects that in the Taper." 
</P>
<P>
Because of film, Davidson notes, Los Angeles "has the greatest talent pool 
possible. The very thing that makes it possible also makes it difficult. Film 
and television make the talent pool available but it also makes them 
unavailable because of the financial discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously since we're talking about fantasy, not reality, the fantasy is that 
we can create a system of significant funding for an ongoing repertory."

He calls it "the living library (of theater), to have the equivalents of 
Beethoven and Rembrandt and Gauguin." That is, the great plays of Western 
literature playing in a repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Arpino sees further evolvement of the art form: "Dance will change, in 
rhythm, in style, and it will reflect how we change. That's all choreography 
can do. It can only reflect where we are in our time . . . There will be a 
change of focus of how the body is used as an instrument of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"But we'll never lose the myth of man. That will be eternal. There will always 
be that odyssey in which he travels. He will look to the wonder of new places 
(for inspiration): The Asian influence -- the attitudes, the quietness, the 
beauty -- and the richness of Mexican folklore. I already have an idea . . ."

MIKE DOWNEY: FOR OPENERS, WINNING CAN BE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT

Volunteer manslaughter. That's what Tennessee could have been charged with 
after Saturday night's 24-6 brutal mugging of UCLA at the Rose Bowl. Our topic 
on today's Donahue show, we regret to inform you, is going to be Bruin abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's only one game. One weak week isn't going to kill anybody. Terry 
Donahue will take a look at the films, point out all the missed tackles, point 
out all the missed assignments, then throw the film into an incinerator and 
threaten to do likewise to the first player who tells anybody what an easy time 
UCLA is going to have this Saturday at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"Tennessee just gave us a beating, " Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
At least this should teach UCLA to be more careful in scheduling opponents for 
future season openers -- a lesson USC also must learn, by the way. Westwood's 
big hunks piled up 59 points in last year's opener and were still averaging 52 
a game three weeks into the season. That even included a scrap against mean old 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody might like to call Dial-a-Patsy and reschedule the 1990 opener. 
</P>
<P>
Know who UCLA opens with next season? 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma, that's who. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma scored 73 points in this year's opener, because Oklahoma really knows 
how to kick off a college football season -- find some convenient victims and 
kick 'em right between the goal posts. (Sadly, Oklahoma's football players also 
have been known to do this sort of thing off the field.) 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska knows football, too. Nebraska knows that any say-so you have over your 
schedule, say so! Say you'll play Northern Illinois. Say you'll play Utah 
State. Place your orders years in advance. Schedule Rhode Island Baptist, 
Columbia Broadcasting School, Bunker Hill Military Academy, Jenny Craig Diet 
Center, anybody you think you can whip. Nebraska this season has some of the 
easiest opponents since Great Britain vs. Argentina for the Falkland Islands. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and USC should pick on somebody not their size. Stop scheduling Tennessee 
or Illinois. Schedule some nerdy, dweeby little school that doesn't mind taking 
a licking for a nice slice of the gate. Sure, everybody will make fun of your 
schedule -- everybody but your student body. The student body loves being 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad these arrangements need to be made so far in advance. UCLA already 
knows who its season-opening opponent will be in 1991 (Brigham Young), 1992 
(Cal State Long Beach), even 1997, for that matter (Texas). 
</P>
<P>
The 1996 opener, you'll be unhappy to know, is against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
There's still a "TBA" (To Be Announced) listed as the first opponent for 1994. 
We suggest either Slippery Rock, Philadelphia Textile or Northern Methodist. 
Maybe somebody under the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so we're kidding. We applaud UCLA for tangling with a team as fine as 
Tennessee's. There is no reason the Bruins can't put this experience to good 
use and spring back to have a good season. Let's talk some coach talk here: 
Men, you can benefit from this. Anything that doesn't kill you can only make 
you stronger. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that both UCLA and USC dropped their season openers should not be all 
that amazing. When you start a freshman at quarterback, and toss him right off 
the get-go at a quality opponent, you should not expect miracles. You shouldn't 
even bet the spread. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Bret Johnson didn't disgrace himself at all Saturday, nor did USC's Todd 
Marinovich five days before. Both of these guys will distinguish themselves 
before much longer. Troy Aikman and Rodney Peete had to start somewhere, 
remember. Johnson actually looked pretty smooth out there. 
</P>
<P>
What hurt UCLA, unlike USC in its season opener, was falling so far behind. 
Asking a freshman quarterback to preserve a 13-0 lead -- as was the case with 
Marinovich vs. Illinois -- was one thing, but asking him to rally you after 
spotting the other team 24 points, forget it. The Bruin offense couldn't hack 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and UCLA's backup quarterback -- Bonds . . . Jim Bonds -- still have to 
get the feel of big-college football. You can sparkle in all the scrimmages you 
want. The game is the real thing. Tennessee's guys came to play, same as UCLA's 
guys did. They didn't travel all this way to see Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"We were glad we already had a game under our belt before playing UCLA," said 
Volunteer Coach Johnny Majors. "Good football teams have to improve from week 
to week." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will, because it must.

IT'S A TENNESSEE WALTZ OVER UCLA; 
</P>
<P>
VOLUNTEERS SCORE FAST, FURIOUS IN 24-6 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
About the best that could be said for the dawning of the post-Troy Aikman era 
at UCLA Saturday night was that the Bruins weren't shut out. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it was a flameout of monstrous proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Is there life after Troy? 
</P>
<P>
Not on this night. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-point favorites, the sixth-ranked Bruins were steamrolled by Tennessee, 
24-6, before a crowd of 54,316 at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"The game obviously was a tremendous, tremendous disappointment to us," UCLA 
Coach Terry Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
At least, the battered Bruins could take some solace in the fact that, for the 
206th consecutive game dating to 1971, they avoided a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman quarterback Bret Johnson completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to Reggie 
Moore with 7 minutes 48 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Other Bruin highlights were few and far between. 
</P>
<P>
Their defense was beaten up. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who gave up an average of fewer than 100 yards a game on the ground 
last season, allowed the Volunteers to run over them for 247 yards, including 
134 by Chuck Webb, who also scored two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, UCLA wasn't able to move the ball effectively until after it fell 
behind, 24-0, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think this would happen the way it did," Tennessee Coach Johnny 
Majors said. "I thought our offense had to control the game in order for us to 
win, and they did that better than I could imagine." 
</P>
<P>
And better than Donahue would have imagined, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an absolutely flawless performance by Tennessee," Donahue said. "They 
were a faster, quicker, more physical team and gave us a real beating. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised at the way we were manhandled physically." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't start out that way. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee's first two possessions went three plays and out, and its third was 
about to go that way, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Vols' quarterback, Sterling Henton, was pinned against the sideline on 
third and five at the Vols' 15, but he broke free from linebacker Craig Davis, 
gained seven yards, and Tennessee was off and running. 
</P>
<P>
The Vols stayed on the ground throughout a 90-yard, 15-play drive that ended 
with Henton slipping through the arms of defensive tackle Brad Bryson to score 
on a two-yard run with 11:44 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The drive appeared to have died at the Vols' 37-yard line, but a personal foul 
against the Bruins gave it new life. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-yard penalty put the Vols into UCLA territory at the 48-yard line, and 
from there they rolled into the end zone. Webb carried three times for 33 
yards, gaining 21 on the first one. A nine-yard run by Reggie Cobb, who gained 
78 yards in 17 carries, moved the ball to the six. 
</P>
<P>
Henton scored on third and goal. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was concerned about its lack of depth in the secondary, but the Vols 
didn't seem interested in testing the Bruin backfield. 
</P>
<P>
They had 20 consecutive running plays at one point. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was more diversified offensively, but far less effective. 
</P>
<P>
Its running game, expected to be a strength, produced only 104 yards, little 
more than half of what it averaged last season. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some of that had to do with UCLA's predicament. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, faced with a 24-point deficit in the third quarter, posted Aikman-like 
numbers, completing 26 of 42 passes for 253 yards. But the Bruins seemed to 
miss Aikman, the National Football League's No. 1 draft choice who is a rookie 
starter for the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson moved UCLA downfield after the opening kickoff, but the drive stalled 
at Tennessee's 37-yard line when tailback Brian Brown was stopped inches short 
of a first down. 
</P>
<P>
Brown came so close to gaining the necessary yardage on the fourth-down run 
that referee Bill Richardson, after calling for a measurement, got down on his 
hands and knees to make sure the play had fallen short before turning the ball 
over on downs to the exuberant Vols. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave us a big lift," Tennessee's Preston Warren said of the stop. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently unimpressed by the Bruins' next three possessions, each of which 
produced one first down before fizzling out, Donahue turned to backup 
quarterback Jim Bonds late in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds, however, was no more successful than Johnson, who completed eight of 11 
passes in the first half for 55 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee led at halftime, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
For UCLA, it was about to get much worse. 
</P>
<P>
In a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven minutes into the second half, the Vols led, 24-0. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee took the second-half kickoff and ripped through the Bruins, driving 
81 yards in nine plays, all but one of them on the ground. Webb scored on a 
two-yard run through the left side. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Burke's kick made it 14-0 with 11:14 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, too, stayed on the ground in its first four plays of the second half, 
with tailback Shawn Wills gaining 42 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But after UCLA reached the Vols' 34-yard line, Johnson overthrew his receiver 
on first down, overthrew his receiver again on second down and underthrew his 
receiver on third down. Kirk Maggio came on to punt. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee steadily moved the ball back the other way, quickly moving 89 yards 
to another touchdown, this one scored on a 10-yard run by Webb. 
</P>
<P>
As if a 21-0 deficit weren't enough to discourage the crowd, Brown was stripped 
on the kickoff, fumbling the ball to the Vols. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt growing weary at that point, the Vols were unable to muster a first 
down, settling for Burke's 45-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
That made it 24-0 with four minutes left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, UCLA started to move. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson took the Bruins to the Vols' 10-yard line, completing five of six 
passes for 47 yards, but a pass intended for Mike Farr in the corner of the end 
zone was intercepted by Warren, a junior cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's touchdown pass to Moore ended an 87-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
It was much too late. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're a better team than what we showed," said Mike Lodish, the 
Bruins' highly regarded defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
They'd better hope so. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Michael Williams, a UCLA walk-on who started at cornerback in place of the 
injured Randy Beverly, was given a scholarship by Coach Terry Donahue, who has 
long had a policy of giving scholarships to walk-ons who earn spots on the 
first or second teams. . . . UCLA tight end Charles Arbuckle was held out 
because of an ankle injury. A preseason All-American, Arbuckle has missed 10 
games since moving into the starting lineup two years ago as a sophomore. "He 
is an outstanding player who just doesn't play very often," Donahue said last 
week.

WHITE PULLS FAST ONE ON RED SOX, 8-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angels do not live on home runs and Bert Blyleven's pitching alone, after all. 
Just when such sustenance was seeming to run out, the Angels uncovered their 
most novel approach to winning yet in an 8-5 victory over the Boston Red Sox at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It will be remembered as the Saturday night flight of Devon White. 
</P>
<P>
Consider how the Angels tied this game at 5-5 in the bottom of the sixth 
inning: 
</P>
<P>
 -- White singled in the Angels' fourth run and stole second. 
</P>
<P>
 -- White stole third. 
</P>
<P>
 -- White stole home. 
</P>
<P>
Then consider how the Angels broke that tie with two out in the bottom of the 
eighth: 
</P>
<P>
 -- White singled to center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- White stole second, forcing the hand of Boston Manager Joe Morgan, who had 
Chili Davis intentionally walked with first base suddenly open. 
</P>
<P>
 -- White took third when Wally Joyner singled off the glove of a diving Marty 
Barrett, the Red Sox's second baseman, to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 -- White scored on a single to right field by Mark McLemore, a hit that also 
brought in Davis and Joyner and gave the Angels consecutive wins for the first 
time since Aug. 24-25. 
</P>
<P>
For those keeping score, that's four stolen bases in one game for White, an 
Angel record. The steals of second, third and home in the same inning also 
represented an Angel first. 
</P>
<P>
With Claudell Washington also stealing third base in the sixth inning -- giving 
the Angels four steals in the inning -- the Angels ended the evening with a 
total of five stolen bases, the main reason they were able to remain within 
five games of first-place Oakland in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
"What a nightmare," said Boston's Morgan. "We couldn't hold them on, what can 
you say?" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Red Sox haven't been holding them on all season. Entering 
Saturday's game, Boston catchers had thrown out just 50 of 187 potential 
base-stealers -- a success rate of only 26.7% 
</P>
<P>
But even for these Red Sox, four stolen bases in a single inning was a new one. 
</P>
<P>
And three by the same player? 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was asked if he'd ever seen anyone duplicate White's sixth-inning dash 
around the bases. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very long time ago," Morgan replied. "His name was Robinson." 
</P>
<P>
As in Jackie. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Rich Gedman. Sent into the game after Danny Heep pinch-hit for Boston's 
starting catcher, Rick Cerone, Gedman went 0 for 5 in three innings of jousting 
with Angel baserunners. In his first inning, he went 0 for 4. 
</P>
<P>
Washington set the tone by stealing third base against Gedman and pitcher Joe 
Price with the Red Sox leading, 5-3, in the sixth. That proved to be merely the 
warm-up act for White. 
</P>
<P>
White stole both second and third while Wally Joyner was at bat. When Joyner 
eventually grounded back to Price, White was still standing on third base with 
two out and the Angels trailing, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't stand around long. With Johnny Ray stepping in to face Price, 
White broke for home and beat Gedman's lunging tag with a hook slide that 
caught the top of home plate. 
</P>
<P>
When White added his fourth steal of the game in the eighth, he rattled 
Boston's strategy the rest of the way -- opening first base for Davis, whose 
intentional walk paved the way for Joyner's and McLemore's at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
It also served as an inspiration to McLemore, the light-hitting second baseman 
who entered the game in the seventh inning as a defensive replacement for Ray. 
</P>
<P>
"Awesome," McLemore exclaimed. "Everything (White) did tonight, he did at the 
right time. When you see that, you want to contribute, too." 
</P>
<P>
According to Angel Manager Doug Rader, this wasn't the first time White had 
requested passage to steal home. It was only the first time permission had been 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
"He's asked to do it before, and it wasn't the appropriate time," Rader said. 
"It was tonight . . . We needed to generate some runs. We needed some 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
White admitted he took "a big chance, stealing home with a right-handed batter 
at the plate. He doesn't know what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
But as it developed, that worked to White's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny Ray blocked Gedman so he couldn't see me coming," White said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Gedman realized what was happening, he dug out the ball and made a 
dive for White. But White had already begun his slide. 
</P>
<P>
"To think someone can slide faster than you can run is humbling," Rader said. 
"It was gorgeous." 
</P>
<P>
White's steals culminated a comeback that saw the Angels erase deficits of 3-0 
and 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Jim Abbott, with two starts and two shutouts against Boston 
before Saturday, had that scoreless streak snapped in a hurry. He yielded a 
first-inning run when Wade Boggs walked and scored on a double by Dwight Evans. 
He fell behind, 3-0, when Jody Reed tripled home one run and Cerone double in 
another in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
And with none out in the sixth, Abbott left the game with runners on second and 
third -- runners who would score against relief pitcher Bob McClure, giving the 
Red Sox a 5-2 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
But that was before White got going. Four scintillating sprints later, the 
Angels were winners and readying for a weekend sweep in today's series finale. 
</P>
<P>
"If that can't get this club feeling good for tomorrow," Rader said, "I don't 
know what will." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Finley completed a 60-pitch simulated game Saturday and received 
preliminary clearance to return to the Angel rotation Friday in Chicago. "It 
went good," said Finley, whose pitching delivery proved better than his 
grammar. "I was using all my pitches, keeping the ball around the plate. (The 
coaches) say everything looked pretty good. Afterward, they told me, 'Friday's 
your lucky day.' I told them, 'I'll let you know if it's lucky after the game's 
over." Finley said his foot didn't bother him until the latter part of the 
workout. "It just got a little sore toward the end," he said, "but they say 
that's something to expect. I had the same thing when I threw on the sideline 
last week. It's just a matter of getting out on the foot and strengthening it." 
Finley was asked if he was still favoring the foot, which he uses to drive off 
the mound. "Nah," he said. "Doug (Rader) and Lach (pitching coach Marcel 
Lachemann) were watching me like a hawk. If they'd seen anything like that, any 
cringe on my face, they would've stopped it right there." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Devon White stopped running Saturday night -- three stolen bases in 
the sixth inning and one more in the eighth -- he was up to 43 steals for the 
season. That put him second in the American League behind Oakland's Rickey 
Henderson and third in the major leagues.

MORNING BRIEFING: O'GRADY IS READY TO RETIRE, BUT HE WILL STILL PLAY GOLF NOW 
AND ZEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In case you're wondering what's going on in the life of Mac O'Grady, the freest 
of golf's free spirits, here's the scoop, according to Owen Canfield of the 
Hartford Courant: 
</P>
<P>
"O'Grady will quit the PGA Tour at the end of this golf season, and this is the 
schedule he plans to adopt: Two months of the year he'll travel in conjunction 
with the book he is writing with Gary McCord; for four months, he and his wife, 
Fumiko Aoyagi, will live in Hawaii; and six months of the year, the O'Gradys 
will live in Japan, at the base of Mount Fuji, where O'Grady will become what 
he calls a Zen gardener. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Here's how it will be,' O'Grady said. "We'll work from 7 to 11 in the 
morning; lunch will be from 11 to 12; 12 to 1, a siesta; 1 to 3, nine holes of 
golf; 3 to 5, seven innings of baseball.' " 
</P>
<P>
And why is Mac doing this? " 'I'm 38 but I'm old enough to retire. I figure 
each of the 17 times I went through the qualifying school, it aged me a year, 
and every year I spent on the tour, seven of them, aged me a year. So I'm 62. 
That's retirement age.' " 
</P>
<P>
17 years ago today: The United States men's basketball team lost for the first 
time in Olympic competition. The Soviet Union won the controversial game, 
51-50. 
</P>
<P>
The final three seconds were played over by order of R. William Jones, 
secretary general of the International Amateur Basketball Federation from Great 
Britain. The United States protested in vain that Jones had illegally 
interfered by telling the official timekeeper and game officials to allow the 
Soviets a second chance. The U.S. team refused to accept the silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The U.S. got its first lead of that game in those final seconds, 
50-49, on two free by which player? 
</P>
<P>
How about a quick kick?: Quarterback Vinny Testaverde of the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers, coming off a miserable season, sees good things ahead. "I love this 
offense now," he told the Orlando Sentinel. "Last year, there were a lot of 
times we would have a play called and I would walk up to the line and say, 
'This is not going to work.' And I wouldn't have anything to check off to.' "

not be good for baseball's image, but he's a hell of a guy to have in your race 
track. He's a player and he's rich."

MOOKIE'S ARRIVAL PROVIDED SPARK TO GET BLUE JAYS GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ross Newhan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The injured member of the Toronto Blue Jays, as characterized by a cartoon in 
the Toronto Sun the other day, wore a wide grin as he reclined on a hospital 
gurney and got a transfusion from a plasma bottled labeled "Mookie." 
</P>
<P>
How appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Although other things have helped the talented Blue Jays out of their 
first-half lethargy and into the American League East lead, nothing has been 
more meaningful than the acquisition of outfielder Mookie Wilson from the New 
York Mets for pitcher Jeff Musselman on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I like to put it is that he's brought a sense of urgency to what we 
have to do," Vice President Pat Gillick said. "His all-out style of play has 
been contagious. The players realize now that we have to play for today and 
worry about tomorrow tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of making something happen, we were waiting to put it in gear. It 
wasn't until last month that they finally did it, and Mookie set the tone." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays were 52-53 and three games behind the Baltimore Orioles when the 
deal was made. 
</P>
<P>
With Wilson, they are 26-11. 
</P>
<P>
Gillick says he was merely hoping to add some outfield depth. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a situation where George Bell had been suspended for a couple of 
games and Junior Felix had run into the wall at Yankee Stadium and was unable 
to play," Gillick said. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed an outfielder and our scouting reports said Mookie could play all 
three outfield positions and still had good speed. We liked his versatility. 
But I have to be honest, the other dividends were unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
A person who cares and contributes, at the park and in the community, Wilson, 
33, has been revived by the trade in the same way that he helped revive the 
Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
He was batting .329 through Friday, having a hit in 24 of his 35 games with 
Toronto and 14 in a row at one point. He had scored 23 runs, driven in 13 and 
made good on all of his 10 steal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Versatility? He had played four games in left field, 18 in center and 13 in 
right. 
</P>
<P>
A .281 career hitter, Wilson was batting .205 in 80 games with the Mets and 
striking out once every 5.3 at bats while playing irregularly, platooning at 
best with Len Dykstra, an arrangement that satisfied neither. 
</P>
<P>
Then Dykstra went to the Philadelphia Phillies for center fielder Juan Samuel, 
and Wilson soon got his wish as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't make any major changes or adjustments," he said. "I'm playing, that's 
the difference. I'm getting the opportunity I always wanted. It's a lot easier 
when you're into the rhythm of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like my situation with the Mets, but I don't have hard feelings about 
it or feel vindicated. I knew I could still play, but it was hard to 
demonstrate that, the way I was used." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also sees more breaking balls and off-speed pitches in the American 
League, which may also work to his benefit. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way, he has seemed to bring a change of pace to the Blue Jays, 
helping awaken the dormant ability. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a young and talented team that reminds me of the Mets in '85," Wilson 
said, recalling a team that won 98 that year, 108 the next, 92 the next and 100 
last year. Wilson was part of that, but he is playing a bigger part in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
How have the St. Louis Cardinals tried to replace injured relief ace Todd 
Worrell? 
</P>
<P>
"We call it bullpen madness or musical chairs," the inimitable Dan Quisenberry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the phone rings we get everybody up and run in circles until the music 
stops. Then the guy without a seat goes into the game." 
</P>
<P>
Worrell, sidelined at least 10 days with a strained elbow, is merely the latest 
loss in what has become an annual injury siege for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Our philosophy is, 'Don't worry about things you can't control,' " Ozzie Smith 
said. "It's a frame of mind. You are as good as you think you are." 
</P>
<P>
And maybe it's because Whitey Herzog is truly the managerial genius many 
believe him to be. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably right," Herzog said, suppressing a smile. "But actually, if 
Pedro Guerrero hadn't done what he's done, I'd be home fishing now." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero began a weekend showdown with the Chicago Cubs sporting a .314 batting 
average, 98 runs batted in and a .421 average with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Said the Mets' Ron Darling: "When Pedro needs to get the run home, he does. He 
can take you out of the park or handle the bat like Tony Gwynn." 
</P>
<P>
Added teammate Joe Magrane: "Pete Guerrero just being in the lineup is like 
Jack Clark was here in 1987. He's an intimidating force. You could put a 
papier-mache figure of him at home plate and get some people worried." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero's contributions have led to chants of "Pedro! Pedro! Pedro!" when he 
goes to the plate now at Busch Stadium. Times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even hear that," Guerrero said. "Sometimes I don't even hear them 
announce my name. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it comes from being booed all the time (at Dodger Stadium)." 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Mark Gubicza, who was eligible for free agency when the season 
ends, to sign a three-year contract with the Kansas City Royals Friday ended 
speculation that Gubicza was hoping to join either the Angels or Dodgers 
because he makes his winter home in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of talk that I wanted to go to the West Coast, but I never 
really thought much about that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I also make my home here and wanted to stay in Kansas City. If that hadn't 
worked out, then I would have considered other options." 
</P>
<P>
Gubicza, 15-10 with six wins in his last seven decisions, will receive $7.4 
million if he attains all the incentives in his new contract. 
</P>
<P>
Met Manager Davey Johnson first expressed bitterness over the second-guessing 
of fans, media and some players regarding his continued use of first baseman 
Keith Hernandez and catcher Gary Carter. Then he seemed to give into it. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez has five RBIs and a .178 average for 73 at-bats since leaving the 
disabled list. Carter, who also recently came off the DL, is hitting .163 with 
seven RBIs in 129 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Dave Magadan was among the dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to play and I don't see anything I've done that rates me being on the 
bench for the last two weeks," he said in mid-week. "Keith is struggling. He 
hasn't been hitting. I can understand the conflict Davey is in and I don't 
expect to be the regular there, but I hit .350 when Keith was on the DL and I 
expect to play more than I have. I want to feel part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson cited career accomplishments and said Hernandez and Carter have earned 
the right to re-establish their status, if they can. He bristled at the 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"With the record we've had the last six years, there's not a lot of positive 
gratitude," Johnson said. "It's mostly negative and unfair, but that's the way 
it is. 
</P>
<P>
"The manager is going to be second-guessed. It's just more prevalent here than 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said all of that Wednesday. In the three ensuing games, however, he 
used Magadan at first and either Barry Lyons or Mackey Sasser behind the plate. 
Magadan went six for 10 with three RBIs and four runs scored, and the two 
catchers went six for 11 with five RBIs and three runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid," Johnson said of the change of heart 
decision to bench his two veterans. 
</P>
<P>
None of it would matter for the Mets if Darryl Strawberry had produced as 
expected. "I thought he'd hit 40 home runs, bat between .270 and .280 and drive 
in 100 runs," batting coach Bill Robinson said. "If he had done that, no 
question we'd be in first place now." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry had 27 home runs, 70 RBIs and a .227 average at the start of the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I've stunk," he has said, adding that it's the first time he has been a 
start-to-finish disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
How has the divorce Strawberry is going through affected his performance? 
Significantly, most believe. 
</P>
<P>
The Strawberrys have a 4-year-old son and year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to my son on the phone and he says, 'Why can't I come home and live 
with you?' " Strawberry said. "How do you explain to him? It hasn't been easy 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell hit his 42nd home run Thursday in Atlanta, but the San Francisco 
Giants' left fielder began a weekend series in Houston with a .220 average and 
18 strikeouts in his last 14 games, the result of a sprained left wrist that 
may be more than that. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays have shown a bone chip that doctors say is an old injury. Mitchell 
thinks it's something new. The one certainty is that he will play the rest of 
the season with discomfort, which may be as much mental as physical. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been times I wanted to cut loose, but something in my head told me 
not to, like I was scared," Mitchell said. "Roger (Manager Craig) has wanted to 
take me out, but I've got to work through this and keep going. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't quit now. I don't want to sit out and have us start losing and feel 
that I was the cause." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Indians slugger Joe Carter won't become a free agent until after the 
1990 season, but he is likely to be traded this winter, having apparently worn 
out his welcome in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
First he rejected a five-year, $9.6-million offer and ripped the organization 
for not allowing wives on team charters. Then he ripped Cleveland Stadium as a 
19th Century relic. 
</P>
<P>
And last week he lit into the fans, who have booing him since mid-August when 
he hit three home runs in a doubleheader against Milwaukee but refused to 
respond to the calls for a dugout curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to boo me when I'm going bad, then cheer me when I hit three 
home runs and expect me to acknowledge it, I'm not going to do it," Carter 
said. "I don't think I should be expected to do it. I know they wouldn't do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The Indians were 54-54 on Aug. 4 and 1 1/2 games out in the American League 
East. Through Thursday, however, they were 11-22 since then and 12 1/2 out, 
fueling both the flames under Manager Doc Edwards and the continuing 
speculation that he will be replaced by John McNamara.

MARK DAVIS SETS TABLE AND THEN CLEANS UP DODGERS, 3-1; 
</P>
<P>
PADRE RELIEVER WORKS OUT OF LAST-INNING JAM 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Davis entered Saturday night's game amid relative calm, in the ninth 
inning with his San Diego Padres leading, 3-1, and a Dodger on first base. 
</P>
<P>
Time for him to get comfortable. After striking out Eddie Murray, he caught a 
Jeff Hamilton grounder in his bare hand, spun and threw the ball into center 
field. Runners on first and third. 
</P>
<P>
He threw four balls to pinch-hitter Mickey Hatcher. Bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
There. Now Davis had the Dodgers just where he wanted them. 
</P>
<P>
With a left hand that was growing numb, he threw John Shelby a strike and then 
fooled him into a fly-ball out. He threw Rick Dempsey a strike and then fooled 
him into another fly-ball out. 
</P>
<P>
End of game, continuation of Davis' roll. The Padres' 3-1 victory before 32,539 
fans at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium -- their eighth straight win that Davis 
has saved -- did more than just enhance Davis' reputation as the best relief 
pitcher in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres think the left-hander, 28, might be the best pitcher in the league, 
period. 
</P>
<P>
"If we come back and win this thing, he has to be the Cy Young (Award) winner," 
said Mark Parent, who caught Davis' ninth inning Saturday. "Day in, day out, 
nobody has done what he has done." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Padres won Saturday's game on the strength of a tiebreaking, 
two-run fifth inning off loser John Wetteland -- featuring rookie Jerald 
Clark's run-scoring double and Bip Roberts' run-scoring single -- the lasting 
memories will be of Davis. 
</P>
<P>
He has a club-record 39 saves. He has a 2.16 earned-run average. And the Padres 
can't keep him off the mound. He has pitched in seven of the Padres' last eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
There should be no wonder why the Padres are on a club-record run of 14 
victories in 16 games and have moved within five games of first-place San 
Francisco in the National League West. The Padres are tied with Houston, which 
defeated the Giants, 4-1, Saturday behind the pitching of another Cy Young 
candidate, Mike Scott. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what it should come down to, him or Scott," Padre pitching coach Pat 
Dobson said. "When you look at a pitcher's value to a team, you have to 
consider Mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Where would we be without him? I can't speculate. I don't even want to 
speculate." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers might be five victories richer if it weren't for Davis, who has 
saved five of the Padres' 10 wins over the Dodgers this year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got that great curveball, a real biting curveball, and he makes you hit 
it," Dodger pitcher Tim Belcher said. "I'm even more impressed with how much he 
pitches, but I wonder, how long can he go like that while breaking off those 
curves? 
</P>
<P>
"In three years, is he going to have a fastball left? Is he going to have an 
arm left?" 
</P>
<P>
The quiet Davis shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't twist my arm that much in my curve," he said. "It really feels 
like a fastball. And as long as the thought process is the same, I'll feel 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
But about that Cy Young talk, he is almost apathetic. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not something I'm going to think about," he said. "It's not going to 
help our team right now." 
</P>
<P>
Something that did help the Padres Saturday was the pitching of starter Ed 
Whitson, who allowed only five hits in eight innings. And one of those hits was 
by pinch-hitter Mike Davis, whose eighth-inning single was his first hit since 
June 30, which was a few days before he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson's pitching surprised the Dodgers because they usually pound him. He 
entered with a 10-16 career record and a 4.17 ERA against them. He had already 
lost to them three times this season, including a 10-1 defeat in Los Angeles 
July 30 in which he allowed five runs in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger starter and loser, Wetteland (4-7, 3.26 ERA), proved again that he 
could use a rule change. He needs a fourth-inning stretch. In his last four 
starts, Wetteland has been splendid in the first three innings, allowing three 
runs on nine hits during that span covering 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
But after the third inning, he has lasted an averaged of less than three more 
innings a game. And during that time, nine innings total, he has allowed 10 
runs on 14 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, he allowed a run-scoring double to Jack Clark in the first inning but 
then settled down to stop the Padres on one more hit until the fifth. Then it 
was the same old story. 
</P>
<P>
Benito Santiago, who had drawn only 22 walks in 402 previous at-bats, led off 
with a walk. Wetteland then threw his 13th wild pitch of the season, bringing 
him closer to Sandy Koufax's club record of 17 set in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, facing .158-hitting rookie Jerald Clark, Wetteland made a wild 
pitch within the strike zone. The ball hung, Clark swung, and seconds later 
Clark was gliding into second base with a run-scoring double into the 
right-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland appeared to calm down when he retired Whitson on a fly-ball out. But 
then Roberts lined a run-scoring single to left to complete the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall missed his second start in the last four games, again with a 
stiff lower back. Marshall finally admitted what several opposing players have 
guessed -- he has been playing in pain. "I cost the team the game (Friday) 
night -- I have to take myself out when I start directly affecting outcomes," 
Marshall said of Friday's 1-0 loss to San Diego in which he hit a weak foul 
pop-up to the first baseman with one out and runners on second and third in the 
sixth. "It's been hurting the last couple of weeks, and normally I can deal 
with it. But when it's hurting more than me, it's time to rest." Marshall said 
he knew he might not be able to play every day after missing 27 games in June 
with a stiff lower back. "This is a major thing I'm going through -- I knew the 
problems wouldn't end when I came off the disabled list," he said. "I knew I 
would have good times and bad times. But when you look at it, the bad times 
have been few and far between." Marshall has missed only eight of 63 games 
since coming off the disabled list. He said he hopes that this winter he can 
strengthen his back so it will no longer be a topic of discussion. "I'm slowly 
building the back up, I've got the winter to work hard, I know what I've got to 
do to strengthen it," Marshall said. "Right now, it's very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers recalled right-handed pitchers Jeff Fischer and Mike Hartley and 
shortstop Jose Vizcaino from their triple-A Albuquerque club. Fischer was 12-10 
as a starter with a 3.47 ERA, and Hartley was 7-4 as a reliever with a 2.79 
ERA. Vizcaino hit .283 with one home run and 44 RBIs. Not that any of the three 
will see any action. Catcher Darrin Fletcher was recalled Sept. 1 and has yet 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
Padre catcher Mark Parent walked up to Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia before 
Friday's game here and said, "I have a thank-you card for you, but I forgot to 
send it." Scioscia wondered why Parent would be sending a card. "For that big 
contract you just signed," Parent said of Scioscia's three-year, $5.55-million 
deal. "You've made life better for catchers everywhere."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
REINFORCEMENTS KEEP CUBS ON TOP OF HILL, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago Cubs have made several late-season changes in an attempt to stay on 
top in the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
They received dividends from two of the deals Saturday in Chicago and staved 
off the St. Louis Cardinals' bid to unseat them. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Salazar, a much-traveled utility player, singled home the tying run in the 
eighth inning and doubled home the winning run in the 10th to give the Cubs a 
3-2 victory. The Cubs increased their lead over the Cardinals to 1 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of ailing bullpen star Todd Worrell contributed to the failure of 
the Cardinals to take over first place, but the run that made the score 2-2 was 
unearned. 
</P>
<P>
Jose DeLeon, seeking his 16th victory, went into the eighth with a 2-1 lead. 
Dwight Smith opened with a single, the fifth Cub hit. Right fielder Tom 
Brunansky held the ball, seeming to dare Smith to try for second. Smith took 
the dare, and Brunansky's throw was high for an error. 
</P>
<P>
Then began the Cardinals' relief by committee. Left-hander Frank DiPino came in 
to strike out Mark Grace. Right-hander Dan Quisenberry came in and got Andre 
Dawson on a grounder. But Salazar tied the score with his single. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Dayley was pitching in the 10th. With one out, he walked Dawson. Salazar 
then lashed an outside pitch down the right-field line, and Dawson scored 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a lot of thrills with Detroit in 1987 and San Diego in 1984," said 
Salazar, whom the Cubs obtained in a trade with San Diego last month. "But 
nothing like this. I jumped up and down like it was the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
The Cub bullpen, which had been hammered recently, retired the last eight 
Cardinals. Paul Assenmacher, recently obtained from Atlanta, pitched the 10th 
for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals' strategy is to try to get runners on base for Pedro Guerrero. 
Most of the time it works. Not this time. In the first inning, with runners on 
first and third and one out, Rick Sutcliffe got him on a foul ball to first 
base. 
</P>
<P>
After Ozzie Smith tripled in the third, Guerrero bounced out to end the threat. 
He singled and scored in the sixth to start a two-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog said it was the first mental mistake Brunansky 
had made in two seasons with the club. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 8, New York 5 -- Ordinarily, a team in the stretch run with five 
games remaining against a club that is 17 games below .500, would be delighted. 
</P>
<P>
In no way are the Mets happy to be playing the Pirates five more times. 
</P>
<P>
When Bobby Bonilla hit his second home run of the game with one out in the 12th 
in New York and the Pirates added two more unearned runs, it marked the eighth 
time in 13 meetings that they had beaten the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Mets, a heavy preseason favorite to win the East, 3 1/2 
games behind the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a rivalry against the Mets," Bonilla said after hitting his 22nd 
home run of the season. "We try and play tough against everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets fought back to tie after trailing, 5-1, when Howard Johnson hit a 
two-run home run, his 36th homer, in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 10th with Johnson on third and none out, the Mets couldn't get him 
home with the potential winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 2, Cincinnati 1 -- Tom Glavine lost his bid for his fifth shutout by 
walking the leadoff batter in the ninth inning at Cincinnati, but he improved 
to 13-8. 
</P>
<P>
Dwayne Henry, who replaced Glavine, made a wild pitch and gave up a run-scoring 
single to Luis Quinones but managed to get the save. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 4, San Francisco 1 -- The Astros have made sure that the Giants didn't 
make the West race a runaway at their expense. 
</P>
<P>
With Mike Scott pitching a four-hitter to become the league's first 19-game 
winner, Houston made it two in a row over the first-place Giants, whose lead 
over the Astros and the San Diego Padres was cut to five games. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, again accused of scuffing the ball by Giant Manager Roger Craig, didn't 
allow a hit until Will Clark tripled with one out in the fourth, and had a 
shutout until the ninth at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell's two-out single scored Brett Butler with the Giants' run. It 
was Mitchell's major league-leading 116th run batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Bass and Glenn Wilson drove in runs in the first inning to give Scott all 
the support he needed. 
</P>
<P>
It was Scott's second try for his 19th. Monday, the Dodgers hit him for six 
runs in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, Philadelphia 5 -- Tim Burke is proof that you don't always have to 
pitch well to win. 
</P>
<P>
Burke came along in the ninth inning at Montreal, trying to save a 5-2 victory 
for Dennis Martinez. Instead, Dickie Thon tagged Burke for a three-run home run 
to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
When the Expos scored after two were out in the bottom of the ninth, Burke 
improved his record to 8-3 and kept the Expos three games behind the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, trying to get his 16th victory, left with a 5-1 lead in the seventh 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Former Expo Jeff Parrett (12-5) struck out the first two batters he faced in 
the bottom of the ninth. Andres Galarraga then doubled and scored on Hubie 
Brooks' single to win it. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
HERE COMES THE SUN: YANKEES' HALL GOES FROM HERO TO GOAT AS A'S WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mel Hall's home runs played a prominent part in the New York Yankees' nine-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
But when the streak came to an end Saturday in Oakland, it was a glaring 
mistake by their left fielder that was a major factor. 
</P>
<P>
Clay Parker of the Yankees and Mike Moore of the Athletics were locked in a 
scoreless battle in the bottom of the sixth inning of a game that had featured 
some excellent defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
There were two out with Tony Phillips on second when Carney Lansford hit a high 
fly into short left. Hall waved everybody off. But Hall forgot to flip down his 
sunglasses and lost the ball in the sun. It fell beside him for a run-scoring 
double. Jose Canseco hit the next pitch for his 13th home run to end an 
0-for-13 slump and send the Athletics to a 7-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hall, who had hit five home runs in the Yankees' previous 11 games: "The 
ball was out of the sun, then it was in the sun, then it was out of the sun, 
then it was in the sun again. I guess I was just waiting for the sun to move. 
At least, I didn't get hit in the head, if that's any consolation." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Henderson and Rickey Henderson also homered for the Athletics, and Moore 
(17-9) ended his personal three-game losing streak. He pitched a four-hitter 
for his third shutout and sixth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
In his previous two games, Moore had given up 18 hits and 12 runs in 12 2/3 
innings. He escaped trouble in the first inning when Steve Balboni hit a sharp 
grounder to deep short with runners on first and third. Backup shortstop Mike 
Gallego made a diving stop, leaped up and threw the slow Balboni out to end the 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
It was after a one-sided loss to the Athletics (19-5 on Aug. 29) that the 
Yankees launched the winning streak that earned new Manager Bucky Dent a chance 
to try again next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics are 27-7 in day games on their home field and 43-14 overall in 
the daylight. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's 17th victory matched his high with Seattle in 1985. It also gave the 
A's a shot at four 20-game winners. Storm Davis will go for his 17th today, 
Dave Stewart has 19 and Bob Welch has 16. All figure to get four more starts. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 7, Cleveland 5 -- It takes a lot to beat the Blue Jays these days. The 
Indians kept coming back at Cleveland, but with two out in the 16th inning, 
Fred McGriff rapped a two-run single to give Toronto its 10th victory in the 
last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
McGriff's hit, which came after two walks and an error loaded the bases, was 
the only one the Blue Jays got in the seven extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
Three times earlier, the Blue Jays had built a lead, and each time the Indians 
caught them. The Indians used all 20 position players and seven pitchers in the 
marathon, which lasted almost 5 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians, who tied the score on Joe Carter's second home run of the game, in 
the eighth inning, loaded the bases with nobody out in the 13th and couldn't 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Two force-outs at the plate and a pop-up to shortstop foiled that bid. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's two home runs gave him 31 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Wills (2-1) gave up two hits in four innings to gain the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 4, Texas 2 -- On a rainy night in Texas, the Orioles kept pace with 
the Blue Jays, and they only needed 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
While the Blue Jays had to go 16 to remain 1 1/2 games ahead in the East, the 
Orioles, on Randy Milligan's two-run homer, won at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Olson, who struck out Fred Manique to end the ninth with two runners on 
base, picked up the win when Milligan hit his first home run in 31 games. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Buechele hit a 423-foot home run, a two-run smash, for the Texas runs in 
the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 3, Minnesota 1 -- Bret Saberhagen brightens when he wakes up and 
sees rainy, gloomy weather on days he is to start. It was such a gloomy night 
in 1985 when Saberhagen pitched the Royals to the World Series championship 
against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen (18-6) had that type of weather again at Kansas City and held the 
Twins to three hits in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson drove in all three Royal runs with two doubles. 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept the Royals 3 1/2 games behind Oakland in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 7, Seattle 3 -- Paul Molitor went five for five to lead the Brewers 
to their fourth consecutive victory and hand the Mariners a club-record 10th 
loss in a row at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners have now lost 19 of their last 23 games. DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>
<P>
Miss Brio came from slightly off the pace to upset 1988 Kentucky Derby winner 
Winning Colors in the $111,800 Maskette Handicap Saturday at Belmont Park in 
Elmont, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Winning Colors, the odds-on choice, tired abruptly after leading to the stretch 
and finished fourth in the field of five, creating unusually high show payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Brio, ridden by Jerry Bailey, won by 1 1/4 lengths and returned $8.80 to 
win, $5.20 to place and $14.00 to show. Proper Evidence paid $5.60 and $15.00,

The United States took the first gold medal, but East German rowers dominated 
the first day of finals in the World Rowing Championships Saturday, winning 
golds in five of the 11 events. 
</P>
<P>
American Kris Karlson, the defending world champion, won the women's 
lightweight single sculls. "There was a lot of pressure, but after the first 
500 meters I knew I could win," Karlson said. 
</P>
<P>
She competes in her second final, the lightweight double sculls, with Carey 
Beth Sands today. 
</P>
<P>
The East German women's coxless four comfortably won their nation's first gold 
by a margin of 2.64 seconds when they relegated China and Romania to the minor 
placings. 
</P>
<P>
East German golds followed in the next two events, the women's double sculls 
and the women's coxless pairs. 
</P>
<P>
The men's coxless pair of Thomas Jung and Uwe Kellner then took their final, 
and Thomas Lange, the Olympic single sculls gold medalist, rounded off an 
excellent day for East Germany with a victory in the last race. 
</P>
<P>
Other American rowers performed creditably but were unable to duplicate 
Karlson's gold. Both the men's lightweight coxless four and Anna Seaton and 
Stephanie Maxwell in the women's coxless pairs were fourth in their respective 
finals.

The New York chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to New 
York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, asking him to explain the recent 
confiscation of negative banners at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Siegel, the ACLU's executive director, said that several 
anti-Steinbrenner banners -- including ones repeating the newly popular chant 
of "George Must Go" -- were recently confiscated by plain-clothes security men. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is a selective confiscation of banners," Siegel said. "And 
that concerns and disturbs us greatly. It's the kind of policy that should not 
be tolerated. It's entirely inappropriate behavior in a city-owned facility, 
and it represents an affront to the freedom of expression."

CLEMSON SURPRISES BOTH ITS COACH AND FLORIDA STATE, 34-23

Clemson Coach Danny Ford didn't like his chances coming into Saturday night's 
game at Florida State. But his team surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to have some people play better than they're able and to have some 
others whip some people, and we did a pretty good job of accomplishing that," 
Ford said after the 10th-ranked Tigers defeated Florida State, 34-23. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Allen scored three touchdowns in the first half, including a 73-yard 
scoring run, that sparked the Tigers to a 28-10 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Clemson's better than I thought they were," Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden 
said. "That was just a good whipping." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman linebacker Wayne Simmons also scored on a 73-yard run after 
intercepting a Peter Tom Willis pass that helped Clemson take a 21-0 lead early 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, who sat out Clemson's opener for disciplinary reasons, scored Clemson's 
first two touchdowns on one-yard runs. He finished with 130 yards in 20 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Tigers (2-0) led only 7-0 after one quarter, they dominated 
Florida State through the early going, racking up 148 yards offense before the 
Seminoles got their initial first down. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State (0-2) closed within 21-7 when Dexter Carter scored on a two-yard 
run with 1:34 left in the first half, but Allen answered with his 73-yard run 
to give the Tigers a 28-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Mason kicked a 28-yard field goal on the final play of the half to pull 
Florida State within 28-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles drove 77 yards on the opening kickoff of the second half to cut 
their deficit to 28-16 on Paul Moore's one-yard run. Willis, who passed for 242 
yards, was sacked looking for a receiver on the two-point conversion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State threatened again on its next offensive series, but Moore fumbled 
at the Clemson 17 after a 20-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting the fumble sure helped out," Ford said. "They are a tremendous 
offensive football team, and they kept me scared to death the entire game." 
</P>
<P>
Clemson's Chris Gardocki added field goals of 29 and 26 yards in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State's final touchdown came with five seconds left when reserve 
quarterback Casey Weldon threw a 13-yard scoring pass to Chris Parker. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State totaled 378 yards offense and 25 first downs.

First probation. 
</P>
<P>
Then Barry Switzer quitting. 
</P>
<P>
Now injuries. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been a great year for Oklahoma football. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners lost starting quarterback Steve Collins after he broke the pinky on 
his right hand on the first play of the game Saturday against Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't really matter much against the Tigers, though, as backup Chris Melson 
scored once and directed two other first-half touchdowns as the eighth-ranked 
Sooners won, 33-7. 
</P>
<P>
Collins returned on the Sooners' second possession and led Oklahoma to a 
touchdown in 11 plays but then left the game. He is expected to miss between 
four and six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve's situation puts us in a big bind," Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs said. "It 
shows how thin we are." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma (2-0) gained 338 yards, all rushing. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners defense held Baylor (0-1) to 206 yards, only 56 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears made only three first downs in the first half as Oklahoma played 
penalty-free and went ahead, 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
Melson, a third-year sophomore, led Oklahoma to a score on his first full 
series, which was capped by a 19-yard run by Mike Gaddis. 
</P>
<P>
Gaddis also scored the Sooners' first touchdown on a one-yard dive. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the second quarter, Melson took the Sooners 56 yards for a score 
and made the big play himself, going 44 yards on an option to the Bears' five. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Leon Perry scored from the one. 
</P>
<P>
Melson's one-yard dive on the next possession made it 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe he was hurt that bad," Melson said of Collins. "I definitely 
was not ready to go in at that time, but after a few snaps I was OK." 
</P>
<P>
Baylor Coach Grant Teaff took solace that the Bears played a little better in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"If all we'd had was the first half, I think I'd have jumped off the 
Tallahatchie Bridge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor's only touchdown came in the third quarter on a two-yard pass from Brad 
Goebel to Alonzo Pierce. Melson then fumbled on his 12, but Goebel was 
intercepted in the end zone on third down. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very disturbed at halftime and told the players so," Teaff said. "But we 
looked like a football team in the second half. We played them toe-to-toe." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma didn't make a third down in the third quarter and lost two fumbles.

MONTGOMERY, DEFENSE LEAD NORTH CAROLINA STATE, 38-28

<TEXT>
<P>
North Carolina State quarterback Shane Montgomery completed 25 of 40 passes for 
268 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another to lead the Wolfpack over 
the Yellow Jackets, 38-28, Saturday in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at 
Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfpack (2-0), despite committing turnovers on their first two 
possessions, led, 17-7, at halftime as Montgomery scored on a four-yard run and 
threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Todd Varn. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery's third touchdown pass, a four-yarder to Mike Kavulic, followed the 
last of Georgia Tech's six turnovers and gave the Wolfpack a 38-28 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech, trying to win its first ACC game in two seasons, has lost 19 of 
its last 20 games against Division I-A opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The Yellow Jackets trailed, 17-14, in the third quarter when Ken Swilling 
intercepted a pass and returned it 95 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After North Carolina State reserve tailback Tyrone Jackson scored on a 
three-yard run, Georgia Tech took advantage of a poor snap and Preston Poag's 
punt of minus-three yards and drove 47 yards to close to 24-21 on Shawn Jones' 
five-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Mays. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State made it 31-21 on Montgomery's second touchdown pass, a 
21-yarder to Chris Williams with 12:26 left. 
</P>
<P>
But T.J. Edwards' 41-yard kickoff return set up Mays' 13-yard touchdown run 
that brought the Yellow Jackets to within 31-28 with 9:46 left. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Anderson recovered a Georgia Tech fumble at the Yellow Jacket 32 to set 
up Montgomery's touchdown pass to Kavulic. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that probably surprised me the most was that we really didn't play 
that well defensively," Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross said. "Offensively, we 
made some mistakes, but I thought we kept fighting and coming back. It wasn't a 
real pretty game." 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina 49, VMI 7 -- Jonathan Hall completed 13 of 24 passes for 167 
yards and two touchdowns to lead the Tar Heels over over the Keydets at Chapel 
Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Blout ran for 102 of the Tar Heels' 318 rushing yards and also scored two 
touchdowns, one on a 33-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina, which led, 28-0, at halftime, is 1-0. VMI 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Tulane 20, Rice 19 -- Deron Smith threw to Michael Pierce on an 18-yard 
pass-play touchdown in the fourth quarter to give the Green Wave a victory over 
the Owls at New Orleans. Both teams are 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The winning touchdown was set up by Mitchell Price, who intercepted a pass by 
Donald Hollas at the Rice 35-yard line and returned it 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Two running plays picked up six yards, and then Smith hit Pierce on third down. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina 17, Virginia Tech 17 -- Collin Mackie kicked a 33-yard field 
goal with 52 seconds left to give the Gamecocks a tie with the Hokies at 
Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Appalachian St. 15, Wake Forest 10 -- Cornerback Keith Collins recovered a 
fumble and intercepted a pass -- both in the end zone in the second half -- to 
preserve a victory for the Mountaineers over the Demon Deacons at 
Winston-Salem, N.C.

Shawn Moore threw two first-half touchdown passes to Herman Moore as Virginia 
upset 12th-ranked Penn State, 14-6, Saturday in a nonconference game at State 
College, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State, coming off its first losing season in 50 years, managed only a pair 
of second-half field goals by Ray Tarasi. The Nittany Lions needed a touchdown 
and two-point conversion when they began their final drive on their 20. But 
Penn State stalled at the Virginia 23 on a fourth-down incomplete pass with 26 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed but not discouraged," Penn State Coach Joe Paterno said. 
"We're not good enough right now to beat Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
Moore completed 14 of 25 passes for 194 yards and two touchdowns for Virginia 
(1-1), which lost to Notre Dame, 36-13, Aug. 31. Herman Moore caught four 
passes for 73 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State managed only a pair of second-half field goals by Ray Tarasi. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State running back Blair Thomas gained 86 yards in 13 carries in his first 
game after a one-year layoff for reconstructive knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia 14, Maryland 10 -- Major Harris and Garrett Ford ran for 
second-half touchdowns as the No. 17 Mountaineers came back to defeat the 
Terrapins at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia (2-0) trailed, 10-0, at halftime but rallied with an interception 
and fumble recovery by safety Darrell Whitmore to defeat Maryland (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia's winning touchdown capped an 89-yard, 11-play drive that began 
after Whitmore recovered a fumble by Maryland's Barry Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who completed 11 of 19 passes for 150 yards and rushed for 64 yards in 
14 carries, pulled West Virginia to within 10-7 on an eight-yard touchdown run 
around right end with 9:08 left in the third quarter. The touchdown was set up 
by Whitmore's interception of Neil O'Donnell's pass. O'Donnell completed 19 of 
31 passes for 262 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 29, Boston College 10 -- The Panther defense dominated the Eagles as 
Carnel Smith scored on a 57-yard fumble return and Marc Spindler set up 10 
points with a blocked field goal and a forced fumble in a nonconference game at 
Newton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The 23rd-ranked Panthers (2-0) built a 20-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Spindler, a safety-tackle, and Smith, an end, ganged up on quarterback Mark 
Kamphaus. With a third-and-four at the Pitt 38, Kamphaus was hit in the pocket 
by Spindler. The ball popped out of Kamphaus' hand, and Smith caught it in the 
air, running for the 57-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After Brian Lowe's 30-yard field goal in the third quarter and Ed Toner's 
one-yard touchdown dive 26 seconds into the fourth cut the lead to 20-10, Smith 
tackled Kamphaus for a safety with 9:06 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Spindler also set up Pitt's first score, a 25-yard field goal by Ed Frazier 
10:07 into the game. Spindler blocked Lowe's 50-yard field goal attempt, and 
the ball rolled all the way to the Boston College 17, where the Eagles' Kevin 
Lyles recovered. Frazier kicked his field goal seven plays later. 
</P>
<P>
Howard 6, Grambling 0 -- Quarterback Donald Carr scored on a first-quarter 
touchdown run of 45 yards to lead Howard over Grambling in the 19th annual 
Whitney M. Young Jr. Memorial game at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The game marked normally high-scoring Grambling's first scoreless game in 119 
contests since a 0-0 tie in 1978 against Mississippi Valley State. It was the 
Tigers' first shutout loss since a 1976 game against Alcorn State. 
</P>
<P>
Howard (2-0) has two shutouts. Grambling is 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Ball State 31, Rutgers 31 -- Kenny Stucker kicked a 51-yard field goal with one 
second remaining to give the Cardinals a tie with the Scarlet Knights in a 
nonconference game at Piscataway, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Stucker's kick capped a five-play, 33-yard drive that was kept alive when 
Rutgers (0-0-2) was called for defensive holding on fourth down on the play 
before the field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Ball State is 0-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Holy Cross 38, Villanova 17 -- Tom Ciaccio passed for a school-record 449 yards 
and two touchdowns in his first start as the Crusaders beat the Wildcats at 
Worcester, Mass.

Pat Chaffey ran for a touchdown and a staunch Oregon State defense held off 
Stanford as the Beavers defeated the Cardinal, 20-16, Saturday night at 
Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Bussanich kicked two field goals, both into a stiff wind, as the Beavers 
won their season and Pacific 10 opener. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, a 19-3 loser to Arizona last week, fell to 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State blocked a field-goal attempt and stopped a Cardinal drive on 
fourth-and-one at the Oregon State 13-yard line late in the fourth quarter, and 
came up with three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Todd McKinney intercepted a pass by Steve Smith with 10:40 to play in the first 
half and returned it for a touchdown to give Oregon State a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Torey Overstreet killed a late bid by Stanford when he intercepted a pass by 
Brian Johnson in the end zone with 1:43 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Coach Dennis Green pulled Smith for Johnson with 10:09 left in the 
first half, and Stanford made it 14-7 with 7:02 remaining in the half when Tuan 
Van Le blocked a punt and Kevin Puk scooped up the loose ball, running 40 yards 
for the score. 
</P>
<P>
It was 17-7 at halftime, but Stanford's Jon Volpe scored on a 23-yard run with 
10:16 to play in the third quarter to make it 17-14. After a field goal made it 
20-14, Oregon State quarterback Nick Schichtle took an intentional safety to 
kill time with 14 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon 35, California 19 -- Bill Musgrave threw three touchdown passes and 
Latin Berry rushed for a career-high 151 yards to lead the Ducks to a 
season-opening Pac-10 victory over the Bears at Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg McCallum, playing in his first college game, kicked field goals of 45, 37 
and 24 yards as the Ducks won their sixth consecutive season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Musgrave, playing for the first time since breaking his collarbone in the 
eighth game last season, completed 17 of 31 passes for 231 yards and was not 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
Cal's Troy Taylor threw for two scores to become the Bears' all-time leader in 
touchdown passes with 37, but he was intercepted twice. He completed 25 of 45 
passes for 305 yards. 
</P>
<P>
On its first possession, Oregon went 75 yards in 16 plays, with Musgrave 
hitting Tony Hargain in the corner of the end zone with a 10-yard pass. The 
Ducks bobbled the conversion attempt and led, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum's 45-yarder on Oregon's next possession made it 9-0. After Darrin 
Greer's 63-yard kickoff return, Cal sliced the lead to 9-7 on Taylor's six-yard 
scoring pass to Junior Tagaloa. 
</P>
<P>
After McCallum's 37-yarder made it 12-7, Cal took its only lead at 13-12 on 
Taylor's eight-yard scoring pass to Ken Griggs with 3:40 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon took the lead for good at 18-13 on a 58-second, 77-yard scoring drive 
capped by Musgrave's three-yard touchdown toss to tight end Jeff Thomason with 
39 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona St. 31, Kansas St. 0 -- Paul Justin completed 17 of 22 passes for 194 
yards and two touchdowns as the Sun Devils opened their season with an easy 
victory before 68,606 at Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State lost its 14th consecutive game in Coach Bill Snyder's debut and 
hasn't won since beating Kansas, 29-12, in October, 1986, sporting an 0-27-1 
record since then. The Wildcats' 14-game losing streak is the longest in NCAA 
Division I-A.

James Gray of Texas Tech did not have much problem with Arizona's imposing 
defensive line Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, a senior, scored two touchdowns and rushed for 224 yards as Texas Tech 
upset 20th-ranked Arizona, 24-14, at Lubbock, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Backup tailback Anthony Lynn provided the game-clinching touchdown from three 
yards out with 8:11 left as the Red Raiders overcame a 7-0 deficit to win. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (1-1) opened its season last week with a 19-3 victory over Stanford in 
a Pacific 10 Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Gray turned in the second-best rushing performance in Texas Tech history. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Tech (1-0) gained 367 yards rushing, its best total since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Arizona went into this game not worried about our offensive line and 
me," Gray said. "And I think we changed their minds." 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Spike Dykes: "We just gave James the ball over and over and he 
responded." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Raiders scored twice in a 51-second span in the second quarter to take 
a 14-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona scored first on quarterback Ron Veal's one-yard run early in the second 
quarter. Veal set up the score with passes of 21 and 19 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But Gray led Texas Tech with a 26-yard scoring run to cap an 80-yard drive with 
3:06 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Tech defensive end Marcus Washington recovered David Eldridge's fumble at 
the Wildcat 23, and Gray scored two plays later on a 14-yard run, bringing his 
school-record career touchdown total to 34. 
</P>
<P>
Gray gained 163 yards in 21 carries during the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said the Wildcats knew what was coming, but couldn't 
stop Gray. 
</P>
<P>
"Gray was good but so was their entire team," Tomey said. "We were simply 
outplayed." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona linebacker Chris Singleton said: "Gray is a great running back. One 
tackler can't stop him. And their offensive line really did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Texas Tech offensive coordinator Dick Winder said it didn't take a genius to 
figure out Tech's game plan. 
</P>
<P>
"James is a big horse and we're going to ride him," Winder said. In the first 
half, Texas Tech drives that stalled at the Arizona 29-, 17-, 26- and 10-yard 
lines failed to produce points. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's Mario Hampton tied the game, 14-14, with a two-yard scoring run in 
the third period but Elliott's 29-yard field goal, set up by Gray's 20-yard 
run, gave Tech the lead in the fourth quarter.

Don James unveiled his new one-back, short-passing offense Saturday, and things 
went well for his Washington Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
With Cary Conklin doing the passing and Greg Lewis doing most of the running, 
the Huskies defeated 15th-ranked Texas A&amp;M, 19-6. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun to see our offense move up and down the field," said the 
56-year-old James, who is in his 15th year with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing to think we could run with the one-back offense and do to A&amp;M 
what they did to LSU last week," he said, referring to A&amp;M's 28-16 victory 
over the Tigers last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies scored only one touchdown, on a 22-yard pass play from Conklin to 
Mario Bailey in the opening quarter, but their new-look offense was a major 
success. 
</P>
<P>
John McCallum kicked four field goals for Washington, from 35, 36, 36 and 37 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they'd throw the ball more than they have in the past, but we didn't 
think it would be like this," Texas A&amp;M Coach R.C. Slocum said. "They kept 
us off balance with short passes and did a good job of running the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Washington's defense, last in the Pacific 10 against the run last season when 
it gave up an average of 201 yards, held Texas A&amp;M without a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Layne Talbot kicked a pair of field goals, from 32 and 27 yards, for the 
Aggies' points. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin completed 23 of 37 passes for 224 yards with no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"I just went out there and played catch with the receivers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis had 29 carries for 133 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M was held to 266 yards, only 77 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Aggie quarterback Lance Pavlas completed 18 of 32 passes for 189 yards with one 
interception. Highly-touted Darren Lewis led Texas A&amp;M's running attack 
with 52 yards in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting discouraged," Lewis said. "There wasn't a whole lot of running 
opportunity that I could see." 
</P>
<P>
Washington linebacker Martin Harrison said: "I think we accomplished more than 
we expected to, shutting down a Heisman Trophy candidate running back and 
holding them to 77 yards. We heard a lot about being the worst defense in the 
league and we decided to go out and prove differently." 
</P>
<P>
Washington's switch to a ball-control, spread-out passing offense with no 
fullback, was a dramatic change from James' first 14 seasons in Seattle, when 
he relied primarily on a power-I formation. 
</P>
<P>
Former Idaho coach Keith Gilbertson, added to James' coaching staff since the 
end of last season, is somewhat responsible for the new look. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased with our offensive balance," Gilbertson said. "But I know 
that we can play a lot better, particularly with our productivity inside the 
20." 
</P>
<P>
Conklin said there are adjustments going from an I formation to a short passing 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of a five-to-seven step drop, I had to get the ball off quicker," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies used some power-I plays against Texas A&amp;M, but they went mainly 
with short passes from Conklin and Lewis runs. Conklin's longest pass 
completion of the day was his 22-yarder to Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
Washington led 13-3 at halftime, getting a pair of McCallum field goals in the 
final 2:11.

RICHARD EDER: G. B. SHAW -- THE MIDDLE YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
BERNARD SHAW VOLUME II, 1898-1914 THE PURSUIT OF POWER BY MICHAEL HOLROYD 
(RANDOM HOUSE: $24.95; 416 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No great figure in modern English literature had a more persistently sunny mind 
than George Bernard Shaw. By sunny I don't mean the contents of his work. He 
was a mordant though very funny social critic and satirist, and there is a note 
of real despair in his two late and greatest plays, "Heartbreak House" and "St. 
Joan." 
</P>
<P>
Sunniness refers to his unquenchable high spirits in writing, the seeming lack 
of the slightest tear in his jaunty assurance. At high noon there are no 
shadows. 
</P>
<P>
This raised suspicions among his literary contemporaries, though almost 
invariably mixed with admiration for his brilliance. It has fastened a tag of 
reserve to his reputation ever since. No shadows? Surely, then, no depths. 
Where is the poetry? 
</P>
<P>
Shaw would reply in all manner of spritely ways. He was, of course, the master 
of the retort, though perhaps his truest retort was to go on writing plays. But 
here, in the second volume of his detailed and fiery biography, Michael Holroyd 
gives us Shaw's cleverest and deepest answer. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had gone to the hills nearby to look upon Dublin and to ponder upon 
myself, I too might have become a poet like Yeats, Synge and the rest of them. 
But I prided myself on thinking clearly, and therefore couldn't stay. Whenever 
I took a problem or a state of life of which my Irish contemporaries sang sad 
songs, I always pushed it to its logical conclusion, and then inevitably it 
resolved itself into comedy." 
</P>
<P>
Holroyd's second volume takes Shaw up at the turn of the century while he was 
still awaiting a consistent theatrical success. This would not come until 1905, 
by which time Shaw was 48 and author of 12 plays. The theater world of his day 
found him hard to digest, so Shaw resorted to publishing his plays instead of 
producing them, hoping to reach readers if not play-goers. 
</P>
<P>
Holroyd, who carries over sporadic Freudian hot flashes from his time as a 
biographer of Bloomsbury, compares Shaw's stage frustration to impotence. 
Shaw's decision to publish, he terms masturbation. This is eccentric, but there 
is a deeper point. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until they saw the plays on stage that such contemporaries as Yeats 
and Max Beerbohm were able to recognize, despite their reservations, Shaw's 
real genius. What on the page seemed wordy and argumentative, took on powerful 
life once it found actors to speak through. Shaw's ideas are characters and 
supremely playable. 
</P>
<P>
First, though, he had to devise a new kind of theater; one that would play 
them. Holroyd gives a superb account of Shaw's collaboration with Harley 
Granville Barker in developing, at the Court Theater, a new style of playing. 
</P>
<P>
By putting the plays on in the afternoons, they were able to use first-rate 
actors whose evening commitments left them free. By using a repertory format, 
they enhanced the role of the director, with "stars" alternating big parts and 
small ones. It was the germ, in fact, of what five decades later would become 
Britain's splendid national theaters. 
</P>
<P>
It was at the Court that Shaw became a superstar, with the production of 
"Candida," "John Bull's Other Island" and several others. "John Bull" was the 
real breakthrough. Balfour, the Conservative prime minister, liked it so well 
that he insisted on coming back with his Liberal rivals, Asquith and Campbell 
Bannerman. 
</P>
<P>
The real rocket, though, was the visit of the future Edward VII, who laughed so 
hard his chair broke. "In falling, he flung Shaw's dramatic reputation high in 
the air," Holroyd writes, adding, in a Shavian phrase, "Except for a period 
during the First World War, Shaw never fully recovered his unpopularity." 
</P>
<P>
In the 17 years the book covers -- one might call it Shaw's maturity, though 
his two masterpieces are still ahead -- Holroyd weaves in and out of the 
writer's theater work, his political activities, his journalism, his 
desperately irritable life with his wife Charlotte, and a host of other 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
He is exhaustive. There are times when the reader may suspect that Holroyd is 
proposing to moonlight a history of the Fabian movement and tuck it into his 
Shaw biography. But too much that is valuable is woven in to make this a very 
serious complaint. 
</P>
<P>
He gives a comic and dramatic account of the uneasy rivalry between Shaw and H. 
G. Wells. The latter wanted to take hold of the cerebral and theoretical 
Fabians and bring them into practical political union with the incipient Labor 
Party. He was coarse, a man of action and a formidable Don Juan, and he 
regarded Shaw's paradoxes ("ecstatic irresponsibilities" is Holroyd's phrase) 
as so much trifling. Shaw's lack of a real sex life also bothered him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a biologist first and foremost and Shaw had a physiological disgust at 
vital activities. He rebeled against them. He detected an element of cruelty, 
to which I am blind, in sexual matters." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw's ill-starred pursuit of Mrs. Campbell may have foundered on a similar 
point. There were some embraces but not much more. At one point, the actress 
blamed the tenuousness of their relationship on his refusal to eat meat. 
</P>
<P>
Holroyd has brought out some wonderful observations by contemporaries. 
Beerbohm, whom Shaw asked to draw him, remarked disdainfully on his appearance: 
"The back of his neck was especially bleak; very long, untenanted and dead 
white." 
</P>
<P>
Once established as a celebrity, Shaw could not resist posing for portraits and 
busts. He even appeared on teacups. The poet Rilke, who was Rodin's secretary 
at the time, describes the intensity with which Shaw posed for his fellow 
Olympian: "He stands like a thing which has the will to stand, over and above 
its actual capacity for it." Even better is Rilke's description of Charlotte, 
who attended the sessions, fussing over her husband "like a spring wind around 
a goat." 
</P>
<P>
Holroyd's biography is a battle. He conducts guerrilla attacks, armed with the 
weapons of a psychobiographer, on the witty, humane, paradoxical and endlessly 
discursive legend that Shaw wove around himself. He wove it too well for very 
much dislodging to be possible -- perhaps because it was essentially true -- 
and sometimes Holroyd's grenades disarrange the biographer more than they do 
his subject. 
</P>
<P>
There is a lot to his credit, though. Apart from his wealth of material and the 
general skill with which he uses it, there is the fact that he takes Shaw 
seriously. And he has managed to bring out some of the darkness that underlay 
the humor. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of Mrs. Campbell, for example, was never clear. Shaw conducted it 
with stage roars and too much wit; we weren't sure about the pain. Holroyd 
persuades us that for a time, at least, it was mortifying agony. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he gives full measure to the courage and independence Shaw showed in 
fighting the jingoism of World War I. He was reviled, ostracized and snubbed. 
By the time the war was over, it was beginning to be recognized that he had 
been saying something not only very prescient, but very serious as well. The 
useless blood shed by millions gave substance to his paradoxes; perhaps it gave 
life to the deeper visions of "Heartbreak House" and "St. Joan."

A HERO TO HIS PHYSICIAN; 
</P>
<P>
LORD BYRON'S DOCTOR BY PAUL WEST (DOUBLEDAY: $19.95; 352 PP.; 0-385-26129-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Merle Rubin, Rubin is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The time was the summer of 1816; the place, the Villa Diodati on the shores of 
Lake Geneva; the characters and plot so rife with Gothic-Romantic potential as 
to inspire -- as it did, alas -- a Ken Russell film. 
</P>
<P>
Here George Gordon, Lord Byron, already renowned and notorious for his poems 
and his shocking conduct (a true celebrity also in the curiously modern sense 
of being famous for being famous), fled in the wake of a scandalous separation 
from his wife. Accompanied by his young physician/traveling companion John 
William Polidori, Byron met up with Percy Bysshe Shelley, Shelley's mistress 
and soon-to-be-wife Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, and Mary's stepsister Claire 
Clairmont. The teen-aged Claire, an early version of the modern groupie, had 
met -- and thrown herself at -- Byron in London in the spring of that year. By 
the summer she was pregnant with his child. 
</P>
<P>
Byron at 28 was the oldest of the company, Claire at 17 the youngest -- with 
the exception of Godwin and Shelley's son William, known as "Willmouse," who 
was less than a year old. 
</P>
<P>
That summer, Byron wrote "The Prisoner of Chillon" and "Darkness," his powerful 
vision of apocalypse as entropy which begins "I had a dream, which was not all 
a dream. The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars / Did wander darkling 
in the eternal space . . . ." Shelley wrote his pivotal poems, "Hymn to 
Intellectual Beauty" and "Mont Blanc." And one dark, presumably scary, night, 
the group set themselves the task of writing ghost stories, a game that 
eventually gave birth to Mary Shelley's astonishing novel, "Frankenstein." 
</P>
<P>
Then, as now, speculations about the strange menage abounded: Was Claire 
Shelley's mistress as well as Byron's? Had Byron, who was bisexual, found his 
way into Shelley's bed? Relatively few speculations, then or now, have focused 
on Polidori, who remains a kind of footnote to a footnote. 
</P>
<P>
Half Scottish, half Italian, "the youngest man ever to receive a medical degree 
from Edinburgh University," Polidori had literary ambitions himself. In taking 
up the case of "Lord Byron's Doctor," the accomplished, amazingly versatile 
writer Paul West is not out to "prove" that the brilliant, rather unstable, 
young physician was actually a neglected man of genius, or that he was 
intellectually or morally superior to the more luminous stars in this circle. 
This novel is by no means an "Amadeus"-style vindication of a lesser light. 
</P>
<P>
What does appear to interest West about Polidori is precisely his 
secondariness: his resentment at snubs and slights; the love-hatred he feels 
for Byron and the displaced hatred he feels toward Shelley for being Byron's 
friend and equal; and his nonetheless unshakable conviction that this 
experience marks the high point of his life: "I, however, had fixed on Diodati, 
the style of life and love there. The longer I was there, the less I was able 
to think of living in any other way, wolfing the sandwich in which humiliation 
sat between layers of splendor." 
</P>
<P>
West, who wrote a nonfiction book called "Byron and the Spoiler's Art" (1960) 
and who has explored the bizarre, the offbeat, the grotesque, and the liminal 
in numerous works of fiction, has an affinity for the least appetizing aspects 
of Byronism, and in Polidori he has found an eminently suitable mouthpiece for 
this novel's potent blend of fact and imaginative hypothesis. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated, obsessed, unreliable, and more than a little mad to begin with, 
Polidori is also an anatomist driven by the dissector's need to see things at 
their worst, which he calls "deinosis." He details Byron's sadistic sexual 
exploits, his heartless treatment of Claire, his arrogance and self-loathing, 
in the mode of the scientific medical observer intrigued by strange symptoms, 
yet in the voice of a young man horrified and fascinated by a slightly older, 
vastly more glamorous one. The Polidori West gives us embodies that strain of 
Romanticism which sought to apply the fearless methods of Enlightenment 
rationalism to the irrational, forbidden, and mysterious realms summoned up in 
Gothicism. His susceptibility to the power of Byron's personality manifests 
Romanticism of a different sort. Here, he recalls their parting in the Alps: 
</P>
<P>
"We embraced once, twice, and I smelled the macassar oil in his hair, telling 
myself that all the fragrance of the wide world was going away from me now, all 
the joie-de-vivre and all the celebratedness; I was to pop back into the hole I 
had sprung from, but irremediably changed. Would I, at this watershed, this 
sheer drop, get the kiss he reserved for me alone? I did. I kissed him back, 
and we stayed there hugging in the recoil from the kiss, our cheeks in touch, 
our lips, our pairs of them, isolated in the spring air." 
</P>
<P>
West's feel for the Zeitgeist is matched by his uncanny, ventriloquistic 
ability to simulate the voices of these historical characters without seeming 
anachronistic. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of his narrative, Polidori is dead, a suicide at 26, unable to bear 
the letdown of being dropped from the charmed circle. Yet before then, he tells 
us what happened to the other characters -- this, although he dies in 1821, 
before Shelley or Byron, let alone Godwin or Claire. (West performs a similar 
narrative feat in his novel "The Very Rich Hours of Count von Stauffenberg.") 
The fiction writer's attempt to rejoin the magic circle of the past is bound to 
end in failure. West, like Polidori, is an imposer and something of an 
impostor. The strength of this novel is that for a little while we accept its 
imaginative imposition.

JUST SAY COLOMBIA; 
</P>
<P>
CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER BY TOM CLANCY (G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS: $21.95; 656 PP.; 
0-399-13440-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Penny Lernoux, Lernoux is a U.S. journalist who has lived in Colombia since 
1970. Her most recent book is People of God: The Struggle for World Catholicism 
(Viking). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although publicists have been known to go to extraordinary lengths to create 
interest in a new book, all G. P. Putnam's Sons had to do to promote Tom 
Clancy's latest novel was to let events follow their course in Colombia. The 
central thesis of Clancy's book, however, a secret invasion of Colombia by 
elite U.S. troops, is scarcely new. 
</P>
<P>
Credit for that ingenuous idea seems to belong to New York City Mayor Ed Koch, 
who first suggested a "friendly" invasion. Earlier this year, Washington 
sources reported that the Bush Administration was seriously considering such a 
plan, but apparently it was shelved after the Colombian government declared war 
on the cartel last August after the assassinations of a judge, a police chief 
and the leading contender in next year's presidential race, Sen. Luis Carlos 
Galan. 
</P>
<P>
That the bad guys in Tom Clancy's latest political novel are drug traffickers, 
instead of Soviets or Arab terrorists, is a measure of the change in U.S. 
perceptions: Numerous surveys show that the public believes narcotics a greater 
threat to national security than a possible Soviet invasion. Nowadays, the 
"Evil Empire" is run, not from Moscow, but from Medellin, the cocaine cartel's 
headquarters -- a geopolitical shift confirmed by none other than James Bond, 
who in his latest thriller confronts the evil Frank Sanchez from you guessed 
where. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Bond film and Clancy's novel prove that reality equals and sometimes 
surpasses fiction. Among the villains in Clancy's book, for example, is a Cuban 
intelligence officer who has deserted his country to work for the cartel as a 
mercenary. As revealed during the recent drug trials in Havana, Cuban 
government officials have indeed worked with the cartel. According to the 
Colombian government, however, the mercenaries who have trained the 
traffickers' armies are British and Israeli. 
</P>
<P>
A former insurance salesman who has made a fortune from spy novels packed with 
details about Pentagon and CIA procedures and equipment, Clancy in "Clear and 
Present Danger" has written a generally credible tale about an attempt by 
Washington to destroy the cocaine cartel. In retaliation, the "druggies" 
assassinate the U.S. ambassador to Colombia and the director of the FBI, who is 
in Bogota on a secret mission. Meanwhile, four battalions of U.S. troops prowl 
the Andes in a hit-and-run war on drug airfields, coca-paste factories and the 
fortress headquarters of the cartel. The covert plan unravels, however, because 
of poor security and the ineptitude and double-dealing of the man in charge of 
the operation, in a variation on the Iran-Contra scandals. 
</P>
<P>
Where Clancy fails is in the details. For one thing, there are too many of them 
-- page after page of minute technical explanations of weapons, airplanes and 
ships. For another, some of them are mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
While Clancy may have seen the weapons he describes, he did not do any research 
in Colombia, relying instead on the first-hand experiences of others. This 
shows up in some basic errors, such as a description of the region between 
Medellin and the city of Manizales as jungle highland, bringing to mind dense 
tropical forests when the area is actually a temperate coffee-producing zone 
with scattered woodlands. Medellin itself has a year-round spring-like climate. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Clancy places a number of coca-paste centers in the same area, 
although the region does not produce substantial quantities of coca leaves. 
Paste factories are always near the raw material because it is uneconomic to 
transport tons of leaves hundreds of miles elsewhere, particularly since cheap 
local labor is readily available to "dance" in vats of leaves with kerosene and 
sulfuric acid, stomping the mixture into paste. 
</P>
<P>
Most such operations are conducted in Bolivia and Peru, the world's principal 
sources of coca leaves, although some paste is made in southwestern Colombia -- 
far from Medellin and Manizales -- where the Indian tribes have grown coca 
leaves since pre-Colombian times. The tricky technical part of converting the 
paste into powder is carried out primarily in Colombia, including areas around 
Medellin and Manizales. But there is a substantial difference between paste 
factories and powder laboratories and the types of people involved. 
</P>
<P>
Such details would be unimportant, only a significant part of the book's action 
evolves around supposed paste centers in the Medellin/Manizales area. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy likewise shows himself uninformed about the connections between the drug 
traffickers and local guerrillas. While the latter receive money and arms from 
the traffickers in return for protection, there is no evidence to suggest, as 
Clancy claims, that guerrilla threats were the original cause of the cocaine 
cartel's formation, which developed for purely business reasons. As pointed out 
by Pablo Escobar, the cartel's organizational genius, the traffickers could 
make more money by working together than cutting each other's throats. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy also implies that the M-19 guerrillas in 1986 seized the Supreme Court 
and murdered its judges on orders of the cartel. The claim, which was part of 
the Reagan Administration's disinformation campaign against Nicaragua (which 
was supposed to have been a party to the plot), was discredited by several 
Colombian government investigations, the most recent of which blames the local 
military for killing many of the hundred-plus victims in a bloody counter 
attack on the court building. 
</P>
<P>
Though half-baked, Clancy's theory that the M-19 and other Colombian guerrillas 
are tools of the drug traffickers is held to be fact in U.S. military circles, 
and in Clancy's books the military and police are always the good guys, with 
the correct information and ideals. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such annoying simplifications and the overwhelming detail, the basic 
plot is realistic and entertaining. Fortunately for plausibility's sake, not 
all the Americans are good guys, one of the principal villains being Vice Adm. 
James Cutter, the President's special assistant for national security affairs, 
who is in charge of the covert military invasion and who, for reasons of 
political expediency, is prepared to sacrifice the idealistic soldiers sent to 
Colombia to destroy the cartel. Roughly modeled on John Poindexter, Cutter 
personifies the political duplicity that abets such illegal covert actions as 
Lt. Col. Oliver North's aborted operations. Suffice to say, the good guys win 
in the end, thanks to the timely intervention of an intrepid CIA agent. 
</P>
<P>
The most informed sections of the book deal with the personalities and 
backgrounds of the principal drug traffickers and the threat they pose to 
Colombian society. Whoever briefed Clancy on those subjects did a good job, 
because the characters ring true, particularly Ernesto Escobedo, a thinly 
fictionalized Escobar, whom Clancy correctly pegs as "a carry-over from another 
age -- a classic robber baron capitalist." Unlike the railroad and oil barons 
of yesteryear however, drug criminals are shunned by society, and, for all his 
wiliness and marketing skills, Escobedo can only impose his will through bribes 
and brute force. To achieve social recognition, he and the other cartel leaders 
need political power. As a character in Clancy's book observes, the drug 
chieftains already have the de facto power of a government. "Sooner or later 
they're going to start acting like one. . . . They keep expanding their own 
limits, and they haven't found the brick wall yet, the one that tells them 
where to stop." 
</P>
<P>
The recent assassination of Sen. Galan aimed to test such limits. Whether the 
cartel has encountered a brick wall in the government crackdown just begun 
remains to be seen. Five years ago, the previous administration announced a 
"war on drugs" after the cartel's assassination of the minister of justice, 
only to give up within a few months.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: AIR FAIR ALICE FURLAUD'S DISPATCHES FROM PARIS BY ALICE 
FURLAUD (GIBBS SMITH: $9.95; 190 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the current vogue for "re-creations" of events in television newscasts, 
Alice Furlaud can rightly be considered a pioneer in broadcast news reporting. 
Incisive and witty, Paris correspondent Furlaud sprang full-blown from the 
heads of the staff at National Public Radio in response to their complaint that 
there were "far too many serious stories going on the air from abroad." 
"Couldn't we get some silly stuff from our London bureau?" asked one editor at 
the historic meeting where Alice was born. "No, our reporter there is all 
Euromissiles and Thatcher health policy," replied another despairing editor. 
The intrepid crew promptly invented a dream reporter whose "live" coverage 
became a tradition at the bureau. The resulting radio spots, 45 of which are 
transcribed here complete with description of background sounds, are a 
hilarious spoof of standard radio fare. 
</P>
<P>
The genius of these reports is their fidelity to daily life, whether the 
subject is Paris fashion, planned parenthood for pigeons or an interview with 
France's largest producer of snail's eggs. The details are extraordinarily 
accurate even when the situations are wacky, and all is delivered in a deadpan, 
news-reporter tone. In "La Legion d'Amour," she uncovers the dark truth of the 
many couples engaged in amorous activities on the streets of Paris: They are 
employees of an obscure government agency (acronym COMSI), hired to perpetuate 
Paris' image as "the city of lovers." 
</P>
<P>
The description of the background noises, too, pokes delightful fun at the 
efforts of radio journalism. The piece on the French Society for English 
Bulldogs opens over "a loud wuffle, snorting sound with a faint menace in it," 
which fades as Furlaud begins: "This is not a maddened pig, or a fire-breathing 
dragon or a threshing machine. It's a squat, bowlegged creature somewhat 
resembling a dog -- a very ugly dog. In fact, it's Beau, the champion English 
bulldog of France. . . . Can I pet him? I'm going to pet this lovely champion 
of France." Sonja Bolle

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: LAUGHING MATTERS: A CELEBRATION OF AMERICAN HUMOR SELECTED

<TEXT>
<P>
The reader invariably wants to re-edit a humor anthology, and "Laughing 
Matters" is no exception. Gene Shalit has assembled some hilarious material for 
this collection: Mark Twain's "Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offences," Dorothy 
Parker's "From the Diary of a New York Lady," Woody Allen's "The Scrolls." But 
he also made some very odd choices: He included three of Garrison Keillor's 
comic essays, but no "Lake Wobegon" stories; Will Rogers is represented only by 
a fragment of a monologue, rather than his newspaper columns. Burns and Allen's 
"Say Goodnight, Gracie" and Costello's "Who's on First" are classics, but they 
should be heard, rather than read. "Laughing Matters" is certainly 
entertaining, but the reader can't help thinking that omitting some pieces and 
including others would make it funnier.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: SPEAK, MEMORY BY VLADIMIR NABOKOV (VINTAGE: $9.95, 
ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON

<TEXT>
<P>
Nabokov eschews the "and then I wrote" cliches of conventional literary 
autobiographies and presents a series of elegant vignettes, most of them from 
his luxurious childhood in Imperial Russia. (He discusses the creation of only 
one book in detail: an embarrassing collection of adolescent poems in Russian.) 
Nabokov downplays the dramatic events in his life -- his flight to Germany 
after the Revolution, his often penniless existence as an emigre in Berlin and 
Paris, his escape to America during World War II -- but he re-creates the 
pleasures of aristocratic life under the czars in exquisite detail. He 
originally wrote "Speak, Memory" in English, translated it into Russian then 
re-translated it into English, expanding and polishing the text each time, 
until the sentences became as delicately filigreed as the wings of the 
butterflies he passionately collected.

Miraleste -- A headline in Friday's edition of The Times incorrectly said that 
an election sought by a parents group in the Palos Verdes Peninsula School 
District would deal with the proposed closure of Miraleste High School. 
Instead, the election, had it been approved, would have involved a proposal to 
form a separate school district on the east side of the peninsula.

TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS NOT MAKING THE GRADE, MOST RESIDENTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Orange County residents give their public schools a mediocre report card, with 
more than half rating them a C or below in a poll for the Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
<P>
But the schools received better ratings in the poll from parents with 
school-age children -- the group educators say is most familiar with the 
schools. In that group, 55% gave the schools As or Bs. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also asked residents to rate Orange County schools on a variety of 
programs and problems. Schools received their best rating in teaching computer 
education but their lowest in teaching values and ethics. The biggest concern 
about schools today was drug and alcohol abuse by students, according to those 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to inner-city schools, obviously the schools are rated pretty well 
here," said Mark Baldassare, who conducted the poll. "But when you think of the 
wealth that exists in Orange County, and the high education of the population 
here, these are rather average grades for a group of people who certainly 
expect more than average for their own children." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 600 Orange County residents polled Aug. 6-8, only 7% gave the public 
schools an A. Thirty-five percent gave them a B; 40% a C; 8% a D, and 3% an F. 
</P>
<P>
But of the 200 or so parents asked what grade they would give public schools in 
their area, 11% gave them an A; 44% a B; 32% a C; 7% a D and 5% an F. 
</P>
<P>
The overall findings are similar to results of a nationwide Gallup Poll 
released Aug. 24, which showed that most people would give a B or a C to public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Local educators said they were surprised there was so little difference overall 
in results of the Times Orange County Poll survey and national polls, since 
Orange County schools generally score higher on achievement tests, teachers 
here tend to express greater job satisfaction and school facilities are better 
maintained than in larger urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a little disappointed because I thought the figures would be higher here 
in Orange County," said Cynthia Grennan, superintendent of the Anaheim Union 
High School District. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, educators say, local schools may have been given the 
mediocre rating precisely because Orange County's population is wealthier and 
better educated on average than the rest of the nation, according to recent 
research. The thinking goes that amid a nationwide trend to demand more from 
public schools, Orange County residents may apply an even higher standard to 
their public schools than the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who were polled listed a variety of factors that kept Orange County 
schools from rating an A+. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a bad grade, is it?" asked Judy Simpson of Laguna Niguel, the mother 
of two school-age children who gave the public schools a B. "But teachers 
gravitate to the good, easy type of students. When you have a more challenging 
student with different types of learning problems, they don't react as well." 
</P>
<P>
After much frustration with a South County school that, she said, couldn't cope 
with her son's slight learning problem, Simpson decided to put him in a private 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said her main complaint about schools is that taxpayers are not getting 
their money's worth. Because of the rapid growth in South County, districts 
cannot build new classrooms fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
"They're well-run schools, yet it's inconvenient," she said. "The school almost 
went to double session, and people were real disgruntled. This is a high-tech 
area; we pay $2,000 a year for property taxes. Why do we have to wait so long 
(for new schools to open)?" 
</P>
<P>
Parents who took part in the survey and agreed to be interviewed cited specific 
situations with their own children and teachers as reasons for the ratings they 
gave. Their examples, educators said, illustrate the importance that parents 
place on their relationship with their child's schools and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But school administrators say the public has demanded more of schools even as 
society has become more complex and more ethnically diverse. Meanwhile, 
technology has advanced at a faster pace than the schools can keep up with, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Schools have been getting a bum rap for years," said Ed Dundon, superintendent 
of the Garden Grove Unified School District. "Yet, on the other hand, schools 
are also being asked to be educators, doctors, dietitians, priests, preachers, 
nurses, jailers and all that kind of stuff. We have to provide health 
education, marriage counseling, drug addiction education -- more subjects than 
those who answered the survey remember from their school days. 
</P>
<P>
"And then people wonder how there's any time left to teach the three Rs." 
</P>
<P>
But several administrators and school leaders said they consider the poll 
results a signal that they need to improve their performance, as well as the 
image of schools among the general public, particularly people without children 
who also vote on school tax questions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed, but that doesn't really surprise me," Rudy Castruita, 
superintendent of the Santa Ana Unified School District, the county's largest, 
said of the mediocre grades given the schools by poll respondents. "If you look 
at the criticism education has gone through in the last five or six years, 
there would seem to be a cloud hanging over us all over the state, and people 
appear not to be pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"But it gives us a real challenge to improve. I'd like to see those Bs and Cs 
move to As." 
</P>
<P>
In their own defense, administrators and school officials say they are trying 
to improve schools at a time when state funding is severely limited. They also 
note that California schools have the largest class sizes in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers fared better in the survey than schools. Only 13% of respondents said 
they were "not satisfied with the quality and training of teachers," while 20% 
indicated they were "very satisfied" and 55% "somewhat satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
More than three-fourths of the respondents said teachers deserve higher pay, 
with 46% saying they should get a "moderate" raise and 32% a "substantial" 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers said they were pleased by the poll's findings on salaries, especially 
at a time when the public generally rejects more taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody likes to receive services for as few dollars out of pocket as 
possible," said Jim Harlan, executive director of West Orange County United 
Teachers, which represents teachers in five school districts. "Any substantial 
teacher pay increase would come out of tax dollars, so I think that says 
something when 78% say we should raise salaries." 
</P>
<P>
While 54% of those polled said public schools did an excellent or good job 
teaching computer education, less than half thought they were doing an 
excellent or good job teaching reading and language, math and science, arts and 
culture, thinking and reasoning and teaching children with special needs. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent of all respondents said they thought the schools were doing a 
fair or poor job in teaching values and ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Among parents polled, however, schools got far higher ratings, with 60% of the 
parents giving excellent or good ratings for reading and language, and 53% 
giving excellent or good ratings for math and science. 
</P>
<P>
In overall ratings, South County respondents gave schools the best grades. In 
that group, 11% gave the schools an A, while 39% gave them a B, and 36% a C. 
</P>
<P>
One possible explanation comes from a previous Baldassare poll for the Times 
Orange County Edition, which shows that South County residents overall are more 
content with their life styles than residents elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
In the August poll on education issues, more than half of the respondents in 
the central, western and northern parts of the county gave a C or lower to the 
schools. One respondent offered an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very displeased with the system," said Maria Patterson of Santa Ana, whose 
daughter attends a junior high school in the Garden Grove Unified School 
District. "We have lived in Orange, in Costa Mesa and in Santa Ana, and the 
worst school is this one. 
</P>
<P>
"If my daughter was late a few minutes (at her former schools), they would call 
me to ask about it," Patterson said. "Here, they don't care. . . . I went and 
talked with one of her counselors to see if she needed to go to summer school, 
and they said somebody would get in touch with me, but they never did. So to 
me, they don't care." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll, consisting of interviews with 600 adult county 
residents, was conducted Aug. 6-8. The survey was taken on weekend days and 
weekday nights using a random sample of listed and unlisted telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of error for a sample of this size is plus or minus 4%. For 
subgroups, the margin of error is higher. The margin of error for a subgroup 
such as the approximately 200 parents with children in school, for example, is 
plus or minus 7%. 
</P>
<P>
All respondents were guaranteed anonymity. However, some of those who agreed 
were later interviewed again for news stories on the poll. 
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of Irvine. 
</P>

ALCOHOL, DRUG ABUSE SEEN AS BIGGEST THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Student drug and alcohol abuse is the most serious problem facing local 
schools, Orange County residents said in a poll for the Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
<P>
Of 600 residents surveyed Aug. 6-8, 42% said drug and alcohol abuse by students 
is a big problem in public schools in their area. Asked about other issues that 
pose big problems for schools, 30% cited lack of funding, 29% overcrowded 
classes, 24% violence and gangs, and 10% rundown facilities. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to further specify what they regarded as the "single biggest problem 
with public schools in your area," 25% of those surveyed pointed to the 
students, saying they abuse drugs and alcohol, lack discipline and manners, 
become involved with gangs and are often truant. 
</P>
<P>
"The accessibility of drugs at school is very high," said Roger Johnson of 
Santa Ana, a poll respondent who said his son is a high school student in the 
Orange Unified School District. "I think going onto any campus is very easy for 
anybody who is not a student, and I feel . . . that should be taken care of -- 
because outsiders can go on campus, and they can sell their drugs on campus." 
</P>
<P>
Educators, however, say it would be a mistake to interpret the poll findings as 
a sign that Orange County schools in particular have a significant drug- and 
alcohol-abuse problem. Instead, they say, the poll is an indication that 
respondents are aware that there is a societal problem of substance abuse and 
that schools must address the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's pretty accurate in terms of the emphasis we put on alcohol and 
substance abuse education," said Dennis Smith, superintendent of the Laguna 
Beach Unified School District. "With the emphasis being placed on it, people 
aren't afraid to say, sure, there are drugs, there are instances of drug abuse 
in our school. . . . It's become a societal issue, and we have a responsibility 
to teach and guide students on its restricted use." 
</P>
<P>
Norman Prendergast of Costa Mesa, one of the parents questioned in the poll, 
conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of Irvine, said lack of student 
discipline and manners is a big problem for schools. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers are intimidated quite a lot, I think," he said. "The intimidation 
should cease. The authority should be reinstated." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Prendergast, whose son is a senior at Estancia High School and whose 
daughter just graduated from there, gives Orange County's public schools a high 
rating overall. In fact, he gave them an A. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen percent of those polled said the biggest problem with schools is that 
they do not receive enough funding; 13% said teachers are the biggest problem, 
being either underqualified or underpaid. And 9% cited crowded classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really impressed with the schools here," said Louise Bent of Dana 
Point, who has a son in junior high school. "There are teachers in my son's 
schools that do not teach. They show movies every day." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Jones of Fullerton said schools don't work hard enough to communicate 
with parents: "There is a gap between parents and schools. Many times parents 
don't find out anything about a student until the problem (reaches) an 
extreme." 
</P>
<P>
But Jones conceded that if schools are failing children, it is not all the 
fault of the schools. Societal changes take their toll on children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of things going on in the schools today that weren't there 
before, like gangs and different things like that," he said. "There's a lot of 
pressure on the child." 
</P>
<P>
Sharlene McHenry, who has three children in the Irvine Unified School District, 
was one of the parents surveyed who expressed concern about overcrowding. 
McHenry said she was shocked at class sizes when she moved here nine years ago 
from the small town of Osceola, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter just came home today and told me there were 37 kids in her global 
economics class in high school," McHenry said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the town where we lived, if a class had 30 students, they would split it 
into two with 15 students and hire another teacher who could give them more 
individualized attention," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Schramm of Villa Park in the Orange Unified School District said schools 
don't challenge students enough. 
</P>
<P>
"They tend to teach rote learning, and they don't motivate them to go out and 
learn something on their own. . . . They don't make them go out and think." 
</P>
<P>
She said her daughter goes to school at Cerro Villa Middle School in the Orange 
Unified School District, which she called a good school. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very affluent area, with higher-educated parents and a little more 
emphasis on learning than maybe some other areas of Orange Unified," she said. 
Parents in those areas, she said, tend to demand more of schools, and that 
makes a difference in how schools perform. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Aguirre, whose three children attend Garden Grove schools, agreed that 
parents make a difference in their child's school and said lack of parent 
participation is the biggest problem facing public schools. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I are both in the PTA, and there's lots of times when there are no 
other parents at the meetings," he said. "We volunteer to do as much as we can. 
. . . We volunteer for dances they have in the schools. We're out there serving 
juice, refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
"I work just as hard as the next person, but we go because it shows the child 
that we care."

OPEN ENROLLMENT WINS FAVORABLE RATING: 'IT'S NICE TO HAVE A CHOICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County residents overwhelmingly favor a controversial proposal to allow 
children to attend any public school their parents choose rather than being 
restricted to a particular neighborhood school or school district. 
</P>
<P>
The concept, known as "open enrollment," is being considered in Sacramento and 
endorsed nationally by President Bush and others who argue that if schools had 
to compete for students, they would all be forced to improve. Opponents say it 
would never work. 
</P>
<P>
In a poll conducted Aug. 6-8 for the Times Orange County Edition, 62% said they 
favored "open enrollment" and 31% opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes parents want to have open enrollment because of dissatisfaction with 
a particular school, or because they want their kid to have a fresh start," 
said Chris Forehan, a parent whose children attend schools in the Los Alamitos 
Unified School District. "That's neat for a kid to have a fresh start. It's 
nice to have a choice." 
</P>
<P>
Forehan is also the principal of the Walnut Elementary School in the Norwalk-La 
Mirada Unified School District, which has open enrollment, and there is a 
waiting list of students who want to transfer to his school. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps us on our toes too, as educators, to provide the very best program 
possible," he said. Sometimes parents transfer their children because of 
problems at one school that can be corrected through a change in environment, 
he said. Other times parents are attracted to a school because perhaps it has 
gained a reputation for its strengths in areas such as art, literature or 
writing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Open enrollment was favored by a higher margin by residents of central Orange 
County compared to South County respondents. While 69% of respondents living in 
the central county area favored open enrollment, only 55% of South County 
respondents agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Thornsley, superintendent of Capistrano Unified School District, said 
the findings in the poll conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of 
Irvine may indicate that more people in the South County are satisfied with 
their schools. But even if open enrollment were allowed anywhere in Orange 
County, Thornsley said, "probably 90% would still go to the school in their own 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
Open enrollment is being used in several school districts throughout the state 
and in most Orange County school districts. Irvine Unified and Santa Ana 
Unified are two districts that allow inter-district transfers, when space at 
each school permits. 
</P>
<P>
A state law that expires next June allows parents to enroll their children in a 
school near their place of work even if it is in another school district. 
</P>
<P>
While parents overwhelmingly favor open enrollment, many Orange County school 
administrators said they oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people always like to have choices," said Cynthia Grennan, 
superintendent of the Anaheim Union High School District. "I don't think 
parents and legislators are as realistic about the problems that can come up." 
</P>
<P>
She and other educators cite as one potential problem the competition among 
schools for the best athletes. Critics also say open enrollment could upset 
racial balance at schools and that the choice will really only belong to 
wealthy families, because the parents of poor children do not have the means to 
send their children across their town or county to a better school. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, they don't know what they're talking about," Garden Grove 
Unified Supt. Ed Dundon said of parents who favor open enrollment. "All that's 
going to do is to make schools even more segregated. Those who can afford to do 
whatever they perceive is the best thing can, and will, do it. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of attendance boundaries and district boundaries has a meaningful 
organizational basis," he said. "If people can cross this district line, I 
don't see how you can have any order, or any racial balance or any athletic 
eligibility rules. 
</P>
<P>
"We can have one gigantic race to prove that one school is better than another, 
but to my mind, it will make any inequity that exists among the schools 
tremendously greater." 
</P>
<P>
Two state legislative bills proposing open enrollment have languished in 
committees. But state Supt. of Schools Bill Honig vowed to renew the push for 
open enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will improve education," Honig said. "It's the same as businesses 
competing for customers. What better way to improve schools than to give 
parents a choice?" 
</P>
<P>
And Honig said there are ways to resolve the educators' concerns over equity 
and segregation through what he called "limited choice." His plan would allow 
only 1% of the school population to be from outside its attendance boundaries, 
and "we wouldn't mess around with racial integration or academic and athletic 
stars." 
</P>
<P>
He said in school districts that have open enrollment, only about 5% of the 
enrollment is from another attendance area. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if a lot of people aren't going to take advantage of it, then why not 
give them choice anyway?" he said. "The secret is, if we give it to them, and 
they don't utilize it, they feel good that they have it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OPEN ENROLLMENT 
</P>
<P>
"Do you favor or oppose legislation that would allow parents to send their 
children to any California public school they choose?"

SEYMOUR GRILLED ON ABORTION VIEWS BY GOP CONSERVATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER and DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) was surrounded. Standing in the hallway of 
a hotel, he was trying to explain his views on abortion. But he could not 
satisfy the dozen or so pro-life advocates who were grilling him, a group that 
quickly grew to about 20. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't go anywhere without talking about this issue," said Seymour, who has 
been an anti-abortionist in the past but who has said he is taking another look 
at the question. "What I'm merely trying to say is this is not a 
black-and-white issue." 
</P>
<P>
The impromptu encounter took place at the state Republican convention this 
weekend at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, where 1,000 members of the state 
central committee gathered to rally around the party's issues and candidates as 
a prelude to the 1990 elections. 
</P>
<P>
But for Seymour, who is a candidate for the GOP nomination for lieutenant 
governor, the hallway encounter on abortion demonstrated one of the pitfalls of 
seeking support at an event that draws Republican activists, many of whom are 
clearly more conservative than the party's rank and file. For example, public 
opinion polls show that most voters support the right to abortion, including 
those who are conservative on most other issues. 
</P>
<P>
GOP strategists admitted privately that they see the convention as "no win" on 
certain issues, hoping they will be able to get their candidates in and out 
without any major damage, either among the delegates or in the press. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consultant Comments 
</P>
<P>
Ron Smith, the political consultant to Seymour's opponent in the race for the 
GOP nomination, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), was quick to take 
advantage Saturday of Seymour's review of his position on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he comes off as an opportunist," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
For other candidates, however, the chance to bask in the conservatism was a 
welcome opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Angela (Bay) Buchanan of Irvine, who is challenging state Treasurer Thomas A. 
Hayes for the GOP nomination for the office he was appointed to last year, 
found herself at home with the Republicans she has worked with for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan, 40, billed herself as "the real Republican" and held a news 
conference at which she hammered at Hayes for not being active in the party. 
Hayes, 43, registered as a Republican only after he was appointed treasurer by 
Gov. George Deukmejian. The former auditor-general of the state, Hayes said 
that his position required that he stay out of partisan politics, so he 
declined to state his preference even though he considered himself a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan told reporters that Hayes had not registered as a Republican even 
before he was auditor-general. But her efforts to discredit Hayes' GOP 
credentials fell flat when virtually no interest was shown in her disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
As for Hayes, a campaign aide, Donna Lucas, said he declined to state a party 
when he first registered to vote at the age of 21. Later, he worked in the 
auditor-general's office, where he considered his nonpartisanship essential, 
Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan, whose candidacy has been criticized by Deukmejian and other GOP 
leaders as unnecessary, defended her campaign as healthy for the party. 
</P>
<P>
"A good primary battle excites the rank and file," Buchanan said. "Tom Hayes 
has never been in a political battle. It should do nothing but strengthen both 
of us." 
</P>
<P>
The convention was an opportunity for Orange County's three statewide 
candidates, Buchanan, Bergeson and Seymour, to showcase their campaigns. All 
three invited delegates to hospitality suites. 
</P>
<P>
However, none were given the chance to speak before the delegates. The party 
limited speakers to the state's two top GOP officeholders and a visiting 
congressman, Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Lungren, director of Hayes' campaign, said Hayes has raised about 
$450,000 for his campaign and plans about a dozen more fund-raisers between now 
and the end of the year. He said that "several million dollars" will be needed 
for the primary and general campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to spend every cent we have in the primary," Lungren said. He 
said he was confident that if Hayes' war chest was depleted in a campaign 
against Buchanan, he would be able to raise "all we need" for the fall 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll definitely have the money," Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans Meetings 
</P>
<P>
Lungren said Hayes planned to meet with GOP ethnic coalitions and attend GOP 
gatherings at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to do anything out of the ordinary or anything to make news," 
Lungren said. In keeping with Hayes' campaign theme of the quiet but competent 
professional, the treasurer will "be visible in a low-key, professional way," 
his campaign director said.

LEISURE WORLD 'KIDS' TAKE TO SADDLES FOR FALL SHOW ENDING 25TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George McLean knows what it's like to get back in the saddle again, but it took 
him 50 years to do it. 
</P>
<P>
The last time he rode horses regularly was as a child in Long Island, N.Y. On 
Saturday, McLean, 64, who began riding again in February, was a performer 
riding his horse Wind Song at the Leisure World's Fall Horse Show in Laguna 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like bicycle riding," McLean said. "Once you learn how to ride, you 
always know how to ride. It's marvelous." 
</P>
<P>
McLean calls himself "one of the kids" among the 644 members of the Leisure 
World Saddle Club. Many of the club's members are new to horseback riding or 
have just taken it up again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anniversary Celebration 
</P>
<P>
The club's show on Saturday showcased half a dozen equestrian exhibitions and 
was the final event in Leisure World's 25th anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
While the show included more traditional events such as jousting and a 
equestrian square dance, the Space Cowgirls were a bit different. Dressed in 
black with silver lightning bolts on their chests, the Space Cowgirls wore 
tinsel wigs on their heads and blue rings around their eyes. Before about 200 
spectators, they rode around the ring to Space Age music. 
</P>
<P>
Then, suddenly, the Space Cowgirls pulled off their wigs, surprising the 
audience with stocking-covered, seemingly bald heads. 
</P>
<P>
Having fun and riding horses keeps them young, say Saddle Club members, whose 
ages range from the 60s to the 80s. Their motto is: "No Rockin Chairs for Us, 
Just Rockin Horses." 
</P>
<P>
"I think any program that's rear-active will keep you young," said Jack 
Chezick, 73. "Remember that when you're 85." 
</P>
<P>
Chezick, a retired cattle rancher, now guides riders through trails on the 
equestrian center's 160 acres of property. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Chezick, many members of the Saddle Club come from horseless 
metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
"They have had a desire to (ride horses), and now they have a chance to," said 
Ted Martin, 70, the announcer of the horse show and president of the Saddle 
Club. "This is something different." 
</P>
<P>
Martin himself took up the sport just 3 1/2 years ago. Although he once fell 
off a horse, and another time a horse fell over as he was riding it, Martin 
persevered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's freedom and a challenge," Martin said. "You want to participate in some 
of the activities, but they have so many of them (at Leisure World). You have 
to prioritize them so you don't get burned out." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Goode, 85, who rode horses to school when he was young, said that the 
stables have become a meeting place for many residents of Leisure World. In 
fact, they treat it as another clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a nickname for this place," he said. "We call it Clubhouse Seven. It's 
another activity. It's a bunch of nice people." 
</P>
<P>
About two-dozen members of the Saddle Club are more than 80 years old, and 
several of them participated in the opening drill event at the horse show. A 
plaque on the wall of the Saddle Club's recreation room reads: "Over 80 is a 
source of pride if you can find a horse to ride." 
</P>
<P>
Camillo Leri-Liberali, 81, who rides a horse named Max four times a week, said: 
"It's more fun riding. I love it." It also eases his back problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Just that little riding today has helped it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The show Saturday opened with Don Smith, 80, on Glamour Girl, and Earl 
Donaldson, 72, on Sasha, bearing the American and Saddle Club flags. That meant 
flag in one hand, reins in the other. 
</P>
<P>
They were followed by other showcase riders, some of whom came from outside 
Leisure World as special features of the show, included the Medieval Times 
riders, who performed jousting acts, and the Valley View Vaulters, a group of 
handicapped gymnasts who performed stunts on the horses. 
</P>
<P>
For the horses, said Wilma Hart, 72, appearing before a large crowd is a 
challenge. "When the music starts playing," the horses are "performing too," 
said Hart, who rides a horse named Count Viscount. "It takes a horse with a lot 
of stamina, and it takes a horse that's well trained."

PHOENIX CLUB TO START QUEST FOR REPLACEMENT OF ITS SITE IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Phoenix Club, a private social organization for families of 
German descent, will begin the search for a new club site after a vote to sell 
the group's seven-acre headquarters to the city of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the club's move to make way for an indoor sports arena has not 
yet been set, but is not expected to come before the beginning of the year, 
according to Phoenix Club attorney Michael Leifer. Club officials estimated the 
cost of buying land and building a new headquarters at from $5.8 million to 
$6.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"They have not determined where they will relocate," Leifer said Saturday. 
"They are looking for something comparable." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the club, which includes a restaurant, nightclub, private park and 
two parking areas, voted 509 to 59 on Friday to sell the property on Douglass 
Road just north of Katella Avenue. The club, which has 3,000 members, has been 
at the site since 1960, Leifer said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim City Councilman William Ehrle, a member of the club, said the sale is a 
good deal for the city and the area's German community. 
</P>
<P>
The city's offer is "not only a fair offer, it's an offer where all the parties 
can win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The vote lifted the last roadblock in Anaheim's effort to build a basketball or 
hockey arena northeast of Anaheim Stadium. The city now races against Santa 
Ana, which has announced plans to build an arena at Edinger Avenue and Lyon 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Neither city has contracted with a professional sports team, considered vital 
to sustaining any arena. Nevertheless, Anaheim expects to begin construction in 
January, 1990. Santa Ana has set ground breaking for spring, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim plans to build a 21,000-seat facility at an estimated cost of $85 
million. The site is east of the Orange Freeway, and parking will be on 17 
adjacent acres leased from Orange County. The city's plans for an arena on a 
nearby 7.6 acres of county land were scrapped in May because county officials 
said the land was being considered as a site for a new jail. County supervisors 
have since decided to put the jail in Gypsum Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana officials announced their plans for a $75-million arena, to be 
financed with private funds, in June. That facility would have 20,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of both cities have said they will proceed with plans to build the 
stadiums regardless of what the other city does.

MCLEMORE THE MAN: HIS KEY SINGLE HELPS ANGELS BEAT BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tie score in the late innings, the bases loaded, a big crowd on its feet 
imploring, no, begging for an Angel hit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This is where Mark McLemore wanted to be, standing at home plate with so much 
at stake on Saturday night in Anaheim Stadium. McLemore was a long way from 
Edmonton and a cramped minor league ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels and Boston Red Sox headed into the eighth inning tied, 5-5. For a 
time it seemed there was no chance they would be close, no less tied, with an 
opportunity to take the lead. Oil Can Boyd had held the Angels hitless through 
four innings and Boston led, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
But now they had rallied and appeared ready to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
With two outs, Devon White had singled, stolen second and gone to third on 
Wally Joyner's infield single. Chili Davis had been walked intentionally and 
had moved to second on Joyner's single. 
</P>
<P>
And up stepped McLemore, who entered the game as a replacement for second 
baseman Johnny Ray in the seventh. McLemore came into the game hitting .234 in 
64 at-bats with the Angels this season. 
</P>
<P>
He had hit .244 with just 34 RBIs in 114 games with Edmonton, the Angels' 
triple-A affiliate. One of the reasons that McLemore had spent most of the 
season at Edmonton is that Ray is a better hitter and drives in more runs. 
Ray's .296 average is tops among the club's regulars. Ray also has 59 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
But it was McLemore who stood at the plate staring out at Red Sox relief 
pitcher Rob Murphy as 42,033 fans stood cheering. 
</P>
<P>
McLemore delivered a bases-clearing single giving the Angels an 8-5 lead that 
Bryan Harvey held in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very sweet," McLemore said as reporters crowded around in the Angels' 
clubhouse after the game. 
</P>
<P>
What was going through McLemore's mind as he came up to bat? 
</P>
<P>
"Get a hit," he said. "I just wanted to stay within myself and get a good 
swing." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy gave McLemore a couple of good pitches he liked, but he wound up fouling 
them off down the right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Murphy delivered and McLemore sent the ball sailing into open space in 
right field. 
</P>
<P>
White jogged in from third, Davis sped around from second and Joyner scored 
when right fielder Carlos Quintana overthrew the cut-off man. 
</P>
<P>
A game-winning single and two runs batted-in (Joyner's run was unearned) is not 
a bad night's work for McLemore, who was brought up from Edmonton Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure everybody thinks about that (coming through with a game-winning hit," 
McLemore said. "The only thing missing was that it wasn't the bottom of the 
ninth. Oh, and the seventh game of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"We won the game, that's all that really mattered." 
</P>
<P>
On a night when A.L. West leading Oakland and second-place Kansas City won, the 
Angels needed a victory to keep their fading title hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
With Boyd pitching so well and the Angels trailing for so long, it seemed a 
cinch they would fall to six games behind Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't happen, thanks in part to McLemore.

TOSHIBA BUY-IN SHOWS IMAGING FIELD'S GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the first commercial prototype of a magnetic resonance imaging system was 
installed by Diasonics at Huntington Memorial Research Institute in Pasadena in 
1983, the pictures it produced of the brain were nothing to brag about. 
</P>
<P>
"The initial pictures were very poor. You could hardly see the anatomy," said 
Ronald Schilling, who was then president of Diasonics' MRI Division. 
</P>
<P>
But a couple months of fine-tuning cleared up the pictures and, Schilling said, 
gave reality to the "dream" of a tool that could help physicians peer inside 
the body to diagnose disease without subjecting their patients to potentially 
harmful X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, MRI technology, which uses magnetic fields, radio waves and 
computers to create clear, three-dimensional pictures of soft body tissue, has 
developed into a burgeoning and highly competitive industry. 
</P>
<P>
In just a few years, more than 1,300 MRI systems have been installed in 
hospitals and radiology centers nationwide, and now are commonly used to detect 
abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord, replacing riskier and more painful 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Just how global and competitive the MRI business has become recently was 
underscored when Japanese-owned Toshiba America Medical Systems of Tustin 
announced that it would buy Diasonics' MRI Division in a deal valued at about 
$187 million. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition reflects the consolidation under way among manufacturers of MRI 
systems. The acquisition of Diasonics will make Toshiba Corp. a formidable 
competitor in the U.S. market now dominated by General Electric Medical Systems 
and Siemens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gain of Equipment, Staff 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba, which barely had begun to penetrate the U.S. market with its own 
systems, will gain Diasonics' widely accepted technology and large installed 
equipment base as well as a nationwide sales and servicing staff. 
</P>
<P>
But the going won't be easy. For manufacturers, MRI is "a tough business to 
make money in," said Donald J. Kokot, spokesman for GE Medical Systems in 
Milwaukee, Wis., which controls about 40% of the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
Kokot said that GE has invested $350 million to research and develop the 
technology. Only recently, Kokot said, has the company's MRI sales and service 
business grown large enough to enable it to support continuing research and 
still make an operating profit. 
</P>
<P>
Schilling, who is vice president and general manager of Toshiba's Tustin unit, 
said Diasonics has been among the most profitable MRI manufacturers. Lawrence 
Haimovich, a medical technical analyst with Furman Majer Dietz &amp; Birney in 
San Francisco, estimates that Diasonics' MRI Division this year will have net 
earnings of between $4 million and $5 million on $150 million in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
But Diasonics officials feared that they could not maintain their market 
position because of a lack of sufficient capital for continuing research and 
development. Toshiba, as part of a $30-billion-a-year conglomerate, provides 
the deep pockets necessary to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts, however, say big profits for the manufacturers are mostly 
down the road in lucrative equipment maintenance contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle is that MRI systems, selling for $800,000 up to $2.5 million, 
are big-ticket items for hospitals and clinics at a time when Medicare and the 
private insurance industry are clamping down on the spiraling cost of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs and physician investors have stepped in to fill the capital void 
by purchasing and installing many MRI machines, both at hospitals and at 
stand-alone sites. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Liberal Reimbursement 
</P>
<P>
Medicare encouraged the development of MRI as an outpatient service. Under 
federal regulations established in 1983, outpatient services receive more 
liberal reimbursement from Medicare than similar services provided to 
hospitalized patients. 
</P>
<P>
But some critics contend that too many MRI centers have mushroomed in certain 
areas such as Los Angeles and Orange counties, which together are estimated to 
have about 80 systems. The critics complain that doctor ownership of many of 
these centers has encouraged overuse of the expensive technology, which depends 
for its financial survival on a high volume of patient referrals. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of new centers through joint ventures by doctors appears to have 
slowed in the last year after U.S. Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland) proposed 
legislation to prevent physicians from investing in MRI centers to which they 
refer their own patients. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, most industry experts say the growth potential of the MRI industry 
continues to be substantial. Drew Consultants Inc., a medical imaging equipment 
consulting company, estimates that this year MRI sales will be $600 million in 
the United States and $900 million worldwide, and that sales will continue to 
expand 10% annually. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanna Hoppszallern, manager of technology policy and planning for the 
American Hospital Assn., said that, just with proven applications, there is a 
need to double the number of MRI systems in hospitals and clinics nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Hoppszallern said MRI is "the gold standard" in brain and spinal cord 
diagnosis, where it has largely supplanted the CAT scan and myelography, a 
risky and painful procedure that involves injecting dye into the spinal canal 
and then having X-rays taken. 
</P>
<P>
An MRI system consists of a large, tube-shaped magnet in which patients are 
placed lying down and then bombarded with radio frequency waves. The radio 
frequency waves that return from the patient's body are translated by computer 
into anatomical images. Such procedures are not cheap, costing $800 on the 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Hoppszallern also said the applications of MRI technology are likely to be 
expanded through research. Already, the use of MRI has been extended from the 
central nervous system to the shoulders and knees, where it can pinpoint torn 
cartilage and ligament. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers say they are perfecting the use of MRI angiography to make clear 
images of the pumping heart and blood vessels. Further in the future, they 
predict, another MRI technology, called spectroscopy, will monitor the chemical 
composition and metabolism of body cells, which would help doctors determine 
the most effective forms of radiation or chemotherapy with which to fight 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, manufacturers are making their equipment less expensive to entice 
new purchasers, which increasingly are smaller hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Schilling said the fastest-growing market segment consists of what are called 
"midfield systems," which are less expensive and less versatile than 
top-of-the-line systems with stronger magnets. Even cheaper and less powerful 
systems are being marketed for use in trauma centers. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Slater, an analyst with MD Buyline, a Dallas company that evaluates 
equipment purchases for hospitals, said that two years ago a midfield system 
typically sold for $1.8 million to $1.9 million; now competition in the 
industry has dropped its price to $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Various Approaches 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals anxious to obtain access to MRI technology in some instances are 
entering joint ventures with doctors and with companies that specialize in 
funding, developing and operating MRI centers. Others are further hedging their 
financial risk by renting MRI units by the day or by the scan. 
</P>
<P>
S. Lewis Mayer, the chief executive officer of American Health Services Corp., 
a Newport Beach company that operates diagnostic imaging centers in affiliation 
with hopitals and doctors, said, "In many cases today, hospitals can't afford 
to purchase the equipment or don't want to. They need someone to take the 
financial risk off their balance sheet." 
</P>
<P>
Mayer said his company frequently will provide up to $2.5 million of a 
$3-million investment needed to establish an MRI center at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The leasing of mobile MRI units also is an increasingly popular option for 
smaller hospitals, according to the Hadley Hart Group, a medical consulting 
firm in Chicago. The company has charted a steep growth in mobile MRI units 
since 1986, showing 300 in service at the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Systems for Rent 
</P>
<P>
Rick Zehner, chief executive officer at Alliance Imaging Inc. of La Palma, said 
the company has 39 MRI systems for rent, making it "the second largest owner of 
MRIs in the world." The largest owner, he added, is another mobile imaging 
equipment company, Mobile Technology Inc. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In many instances, Zehner said, hospitals rent an MRI unit until they are 
convinced they have enough patient business to justify buying one. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is favorably impressed by the proliferation of MRI technology. Dr. 
Tom Mayer, director of managed care for the medical audit services division of 
Mercer Meidinger Hansen, a consultant on employee medical benefits, said he 
believes "there is probably no question that there are too many" MRI centers. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer said hospitals frequently obtain MRI units, not because of community 
need, but because they are determined to keep up with competitors. "Most 
hospitals in California, which is very competitive, feel that it is necessary 
to provide technologies like MRI in order to meet the expectations of their 
medical staff," he said. "They want to keep their physicians admitting to their 
facility rather than down the block to a hospital that has an MRI unit." 
</P>
<P>
Mayer said he also is concerned that in many instances physicians are ordering 
MRI scans when much cheaper diagnostic alternatives, such as CAT scans or 
simple X-rays, would be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
The growing use of MRI systems is a concern to medical insurance companies, 
which have difficulty determining the effectiveness of the new technology in 
relation to older technologies so they can establish reimbursement policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a reasonable and effective process for controlled expansion of 
technology, the fear is the conflict between technological advancement and 
health-care cost containment will be difficult to resolve," said Joel Miller, 
director of the medical practice assessment unit of Health Insurance Assn. of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
MRI centers throughout the country, meanwhile, are marketing their service to 
local referring physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Nate Kaufman, president of the group at Medical Imaging Centers of America in 
San Diego that operates MRI centers, generally in joint ventures with hospitals 
or doctors, emphasized that owning an MRI center can be extremely risky. He 
said that a top-of-the-line machine may need to treat nine to 10 patients a day 
to break even. And, since an MRI scan generally takes 45 minutes to perform, 
making a profit means long operating hours, including scheduling patients at 
night and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Centers Lose Money 
</P>
<P>
Terry Gill, executive director of the Cooperative in Del Mar, a consultant to 
MRI centers, contends that about 20% of the centers nationwide are "just paying 
their bills" and 15% are losing money, some in large bundles. He said one 
center in Texas he would not identify tells him it is doing only two scans a 
day and losing $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
But Cherrill Farnsworth, chief executive officer of TME Inc., a Dallas company 
that has developed 13 MRI centers, said that "without a doubt, the majority of 
clinics around the country are making money." She said each MRI clinic costs 
about $4 million to establish. That can be paid off in five years, she added, 
after which "you will make a tremendous amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE MIRACLE OF MRI 
</P>
<P>
Some current MRI applications 
</P>
<P>
In the brain to discover tumors, strokes, multiple sclerosis and hydrocephalus 
(a cause of dimentia). 
</P>
<P>
In the neck and lower back to discover herniated discs and in the spinal cord 
to discover tumors. 
</P>
<P>
In joints such as the knee to discover torn cartilege and ligaments and in the 
shoulder to locate rotator cup tears. 
</P>
<P>
Potential MRI applications 
</P>
<P>
Magnetic resonance angiograms of blood vessels to diagnose aneurysms and other 
vascular abnormalities that could cause strokes or hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
Scanning of the liver for malignant tumors. 
</P>
<P>
Spectroscopy, a chemical analysis of tissues in organs such as the brain and 
heart for early detection of decreased blood supply caused by blocked vessels 
that could lead to strokes and heart attacks. This technique also could be used 
to individualize cancer treatment by allowing doctors to adjust radiation and 
chemotherapy depending on the chemical composition of the malignant tumor.

REAL ESTATE Q AND A: WHAT TO DO IF YOUR HOME DOESN'T SELL AS QUICKLY AS YOU 
WOULD LIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: About six weeks ago we listed our home for sale with a very highly 
recommended realty agent. He suggested the asking price and cautioned us that 
most homes sell for about 5% less. His company advertised our home heavily, put 
it on the local multiple listing tour for agents from other companies, and held 
open houses the first three weekends. 
</P>
<P>
But we haven't received any written offers. Our agent knows we are very anxious 
to sell due to an out-of-town job promotion. Fortunately, we only signed a 
60-day listing, as we are very disappointed with our agent. As our listing 
expires soon, what should we do to get our home sold fast? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your major mistake was not interviewing at least three realty agents 
about listing your home for sale. No matter how highly recommended the agent, 
you owed it to yourself to receive the written "comparative market analysis" 
forms from at least two other agents to learn what they thought your home is 
worth. Perhaps your agent estimated too high a price. 
</P>
<P>
But you are to be congratulated for not signing a long listing. Although it 
appears your agent is doing a good job, if you are not satisfied you can switch 
to another agent when your 60-day listing expires. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest you interview several other agents. Select these agents based on the 
recommendations of friends, business associates and success records of agents 
who sell homes in your neighborhood. Of course, include the agent who presently 
has your listing. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the local market has changed since you listed your home. A price 
adjustment may be necessary. In some communities the number of prospective 
buyers increased when mortgage rates dropped in the last few months. But realty 
agents in other towns tell me their prospects declined because of economic 
uncertainty, expectations of possible further interest rate declines and the 
traditional summer slump. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons a home may not sell immediately. It may be overpriced, 
in poor physical condition, in a bad location, listed by an agent other local 
agents don't like to work with, ineptly marketed or just not the type of home 
for which there is much demand. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in most towns three-bedroom homes sell much faster than 
two-bedroom homes, and condos sell slower than single-family houses. But 
setting the correct asking price close to the actual market value usually 
solves most problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criteria Used for Selecting Questions 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have written you several times, but you never answer my questions in the 
newspaper. How do you select the questions and why haven't you answered my 
questions? 
</P>
<P>
A: Because of the high volume of letters, I can only select the questions of 
widest interest to readers. Most letters must be condensed to conserve space. 
Short, typewritten letters receive preference over rambling, multipage, 
handwritten letters. Questions written on post cards are best, especially if 
the answer will be helpful to many readers in similar circumstances. Unique, 
unusual or bizarre questions have virtually no chance of making the column. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Seller, 82, Use $125,000 Exemption? 
</P>
<P>
Q: My daughter is urging me to sell my home and move to a nice church-sponsored 
retirement home. At age 82, I am almost ready to give in because there are only 
a few men and many nice ladies there. However, I will only have about a $40,000 
net profit on the sale of my home. I can easily afford to pay the tax. But I 
read in your column about an "over 55 rule" tax exemption for the elderly. As I 
hate to pay taxes, could I use this tax exemption? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The "over 55 rule" of Internal Revenue Code 121 allows a tax exemption 
on up to $125,000 of profit when selling your principal residence. To qualify 
you must have owned and lived in your home any three of the five years before 
its sale and never have used this tax break before. 
</P>
<P>
However, this is a once-per-lifetime exemption, so if you use it to shelter 
your $40,000 profit from tax, the remaining $85,000 of your entitlement is 
wasted. But at your age I doubt you will be buying another home, so I recommend 
using your exemption. Please consult your CPA for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fixed-Rate Mortgages Best in Mixed Market 
</P>
<P>
A: My husband and I are considering refinancing our adjustable-rate mortgage. 
The lender just sent us a notice that our interest rate will be going up. But I 
thought you said mortgage interest rates had come down. As we have a large 
equity in our home, over $50,000, we are thinking of taking out some cash to 
use for investments and to pay off bills. Do you recommend a refinanced 
fixed-rate mortgage instead of an adjustable? 
</P>
<P>
A: In today's mixed-up interest-rate environment, fixed-rate mortgages are by 
far the best deal. Adjustables are too expensive after the initial teaser rate, 
which only lasts three to 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
As of this writing, fixed rate mortgages are around 10%. Teaser adjustables 
rates are in the 8% to 9% range initially, but after the first adjustment they 
will rise close to 10%. The problem is the indexes used for adjustables, 
usually the cost of funds index or the treasury bill index, are far too high 
after a "margin" of at least 2% is added on. 
</P>
<P>
This major problem is keeping S&amp;L executives awake at night, as if they 
don't already have enough problems. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, mortgage lenders came up with the idea of adjustable mortgages 
to shift the interest-rate risk from lenders to borrowers. But the idea has now 
backfired on the lenders. Borrowers are refinancing their adjustables in droves 
to fixed-rate mortgages, which are cheaper, thus shifting the interest-rate 
risk back to the lenders. I think you will sleep much better with a fixed-rate 
mortgage at today's affordable interest rate.

Tips on Using Rollover Replacement Rule 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last weekend we saw some beautiful new homes, which are located near where 
my husband's company is constructing its new suburban office building. He has 
been told to expect to move there in February. 
</P>
<P>
We owe about $74,000 on our home mortgage and are thinking of selling our home, 
as the commute will take almost one hour each way. If we sell our home and buy 
a new home near my husband's job, we figure on netting about $75,000 after 
paying off our mortgage. You often explain how to defer tax when selling a 
home, but how does the mortgage enter into the calculation? 
</P>
<P>
A: The mortgages on your old and new homes have nothing to do with deferring 
the profit tax on the sale of your old home. To use the "rollover residence 
replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034, just buy a replacement 
principal residence costing at least as much as your old home's net (adjusted) 
sales price within 24 months before or after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you can sell your old home for cash, pay off the old mortgage, and 
buy a replacement home of equal or greater cost with nothing down using a VA 
mortgage. You can then spend your tax-deferred cash as you wish. Please consult 
your CPA for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watch Out for the Excess-Mortgage Trap 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own a rather expensive home, which has proven difficult to sell. It has 
been listed with two realtors in the last six months but neither could sell it. 
They tell me the problem is that most mortgage lenders don't want to make a 
"jumbo loan" and there are few cash buyers in our town. 
</P>
<P>
I am willing to sell for a 10% down payment, but my CPA says I can't afford to 
carry back a second mortgage (my first mortgage is assumable) because I have an 
"excess mortgage," which would be taxable. Is there any way around this 
problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Since we just lost 99% of our readers, let me back up to illustrate 
your excess mortgage problem, which many home sellers also have, but they don't 
know it. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose you sell your home for $100,000 with $10,000 down and it has a $75,000 
mortgage which you refinanced a few years ago. However, also imagine your cost 
for the home was $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
That means you have a $25,000 excess mortgage ($75,000 minus $50,000). This 
$25,000 becomes taxable when you sell. However, if you only receive a $10,000 
down payment, the profit tax on the $25,000 excess mortgage will eat up most of 
the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid this problem, instead of carrying back a $15,000 second mortgage, 
carry back a $90,000 "wraparound" all-inclusive mortgage. Since you remain 
obligated on the underlying first mortgage, you won't immediately have to pay 
tax on your excess mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like you need a new CPA who is familiar with the latest tax court 
decisions on wraparound mortgages to avoid excess mortgage problems. 
</P>

<P>
Auctioneer Disagrees With Advice to Sellers 
</P>
<P>
Q: I strongly disagree with your advice to a prospective home seller about not 
auctioning her home. As a professional auctioneer with hundreds of satisfied 
sellers, I suggest you learn more about auctions. 
</P>
<P>
A properly advertised and conducted auction usually brings far more than a 
traditional negotiated home sale handled by a realty agent. You are correct 
that auctioneers usually handle distress sales, such as bankruptcies, but we 
are encountering many home sellers who want to get top dollar. Isn't it time 
you give auctions a fair chance? 
</P>
<P>
A: Auctions have their place, but I do not think typical home sales are the 
appropriate situation for auctions. People who bid at auctions want to buy 
bargains. If a home seller expects to get top dollar, and bidders want 
bargains, there seems to be an inherent conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The residential real estate auctions I have attended were either distress 
properties or unique homes that a realty agent could not sell in the usual 
negotiated manner. The key to the distress property sales was financing 
prearranged by the auctioneer. This is usually not feasible in an auction of 
just one home. Without more evidence, I'm not convinced auctions are the best 
way to sell homes. 
</P>

How to Clear Title After Joint Tenant Dies 
</P>
<P>
Q: My brother and I owned land together as joint tenants. He was killed in a 
motorcycle crash about two months ago. He left all his personal assets to me. 
How can I clear up the title to the land? 
</P>
<P>
A: The big advantage of owning property as joint tenants with right of 
survivorship is avoidance of probate. In most states, all you must do is go to 
the local county office where deeds are recorded to file an affidavit of 
survivorship and a certified copy of your late brother's death certificate. For 
further details, please consult an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Get Written Disclosure of Defects in House 
</P>
<P>
Q: About two years ago, some friends bought their first home. It turned out to 
be a nightmare. Although the house is located in a built-up suburb, they were 
shocked to learn the house was not connected to the city sewer. When the septic 
tank stopped up, they had to pay about $4,500 to connect to the sewer. 
</P>
<P>
But their worst problems are structural. The seller apparently built several 
additions, which do not conform to the building code. The pier foundations are 
sinking and the house's floor now slopes noticeably. My wife and I are thinking 
about buying our first home and don't want to get caught in a similar 
situation. How can innocent buyers like our friends and ourselves prevent being 
stuck with a lemon? 
</P>
<P>
A: The best way to avoid problems is to prevent them. When you find a home on 
which you want to make an offer to buy, before making your offer, ask the 
sellers and realty agent to disclose in writing any known defects in the house. 
Some states, such as California, require such disclosures. In other states, the 
best realty agents insist their sellers disclose home defects to prevent future 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, your purchase offer should provide contingency clauses for any 
professional inspections you want. In most areas, it is customary to obtain a 
termite or pest control inspection. The seller usually pays for any necessary 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
You may also want to make your offer contingent upon a satisfactory 
professional inspection report. The realty agent can give you a list of local 
inspectors who, for around $200, will give you a complete written report on the 
condition of the house. Many sellers now provide these reports to assure buyers 
the house is in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
If you are suspicious about any part of the home, your purchase offer can 
provide a contingency clause for a satisfactory inspection report for that 
component. For example, if the roof looks old you may want to specify a roof 
inspection at your expense. Or if the wiring, plumbing and heating systems seem 
inadequate you can specify appropriate inspection contingencies. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you don't want to have these inspections made until after your 
purchase offer is accepted by the home seller. Otherwise, you might be wasting 
your money on unnecessary inspectors. But such reports can be reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a year ago I bought a badly run-down house. I was debating whether 
to tear it down or renovate it. For $250 I hired a professional inspector who 
checked every component of that house. His report assured me the house looked 
awful but was in basically sound condition. Incidentally, accompany the 
inspector so you can learn all about the home you plan to buy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Make Certain Loan Payoff Is Recorded 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recall several letters in your column about homeowners who had 
difficulties clearing the title when paying off their mortgages. What is the 
best way to avoid problems? 
</P>
<P>
A: Phone or write your mortgage lender to obtain the final payment amount as of 
the date you expect to pay off your loan, such as the first day of next month. 
A few days before that date, mail or deliver your final payment to the lender. 
</P>
<P>
If you mail it, send it by certified mail with a return receipt requested. 
</P>
<P>
Include a letter specifying that this is your final payment and you expect the 
lender to promptly record a mortgage satisfaction or deed of reconveyance and 
to send you proof this has been done. If you do not receive this documentation 
within 30 days, contact the lender. 
</P>
<P>
Many lenders fail to promptly record loan payoffs, thus causing difficulties 
for borrowers many years later, who find the paid off mortgage still encumbers 
their property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consult an Attorney Before Selling Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: A dear friend received a very good, unsolicited offer to sell her home. She 
asked my advice whether there should be any penalty for the buyer forfeiting 
part of his earnest money deposit if he does not complete the purchase due to 
inability to obtain a mortgage and if she should accept a back-up offer in case 
the first buyer does not complete his purchase? What should I tell my friend? 
</P>
<P>
A: Since you did not mention any real estate agent involved, your friend should 
consult a real estate attorney for assistance as to the legal aspects of the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Presuming the buyer's purchase offer contains a properly worded mortgage 
contingency clause, if he is unable to obtain the mortgage specified, then he 
is free to cancel the purchase. A well-worded contingency clause should contain 
a time limit for obtaining the loan, such as 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is no reason your friend should not be compensated if the buyer 
does not complete his purchase. If she has not already accepted the offer, she 
could add in her counteroffer that if the buyer does not complete the purchase 
for any reason, the seller is entitled to $5,000 as liquidated damages. 
</P>
<P>
Liquidated damages means agreed damages since the exact amount of harm to the 
seller is difficult to determine. Without such a clause, the buyer has a free 
option to tie up the house while he shops for a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, your seller friend can show the house to other prospective buyers and 
receive their back-up offer. However, she should accept such an offer only with 
the contingency of being released from the first buyer's offer. Without such a 
conditional acceptance of a second offer, the seller could become obligated to 
sell the same house to two different buyers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selling Without Realtor Is Not Recommended 
</P>
<P>
Q: Shame on you for constantly telling home sellers they need a realty agent to 
sell their home. I have sold two of my homes without any realty agent and both 
sales went very smoothly. I saved over $20,000 in sales commissions by selling 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
The key to success is to have a good real estate lawyer who quickly prepares 
the paper work so there is no delay when a buyer wants to buy. Both times I 
sold my homes I just ran newspaper want ads for a few weeks, answered lots of 
phone calls, held weekend open houses, and saved lots of money. I'll bet you 
are on the payroll of the realtors. Are you? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, I am not paid in any way by the realtors to recommend home sellers use a 
professional realty agent when selling their home. 
</P>
<P>
However, I must strongly disagree with you. Ninety-nine percent of home sellers 
are not able to cope with selling their home alone. One costly mistake can be 
far more expensive than paying a real estate sales commission. 
</P>
<P>
For example, failure to disclose to the buyer a known defect in the home may 
result in a lawsuit which can cost the seller far more than the sales 
commission savings. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that most home sellers are not able to prepare a legally 
binding sales contract. In these days of complicated home sales, which are 
contingent on details such as loan approval and inspections, even realty agents 
have to work very hard to keep sales from falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with you the sales commissions seem like lots of money but the top 
realty agents earn every penny. 
</P>
<P>
That is why I suggest home sellers interview at least three local realty agents 
and phone their client references to ask "Were you satisfied with your agent 
and would you list your home again with the same agent?" before selecting the 
best one. 
</P>
<P>
Realty agents don't like me to say that, but selecting a successful realty 
agent is the key to a profitable home sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home-Equity Sharing Is Sometimes Risky 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have read some newspaper and magazine articles about home equity-sharing. 
As I understand the concept, an investor co-owner makes the down payment and 
the resident co-owner lives in the house and pays the mortgage, property tax 
and maintenance expenses. 
</P>
<P>
After five to 10 years, they agree to sell or refinance the house to pay back 
the investor and give him part of the profit. I want to invest in houses on 
this basis, as I think this would be a great way to own part of the property 
without any management or maintenance work. What do you think of equity 
sharing? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not much. From your viewpoint, the big pitfall of equity sharing can occur 
if the resident co-owner fails to make the payments. As the non-resident 
co-owner, what will you do to get the resident co-owner out of the property? 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, you can't evict a co-owner like you would evict a deadbeat tenant. 
The legal answer is you must take the resident to court in a quiet title 
action. This could take a long time and be expensive, while the resident 
continues living in the house. 
</P>
<P>
The resident might argue that he has built up some equity in the house and must 
be reimbursed. A difficult resident with a shrewd lawyer can tie you up for a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
Internal Revenue Code 280A, which authorizes equity sharing, says all owners 
must be title holders if they are to claim tax deductions. This eliminates the 
lease-option idea some misguided equity-sharing advocates suggest. Some equity 
sharing enthusiasts recommend that both parties sign quit claim deeds to be 
held by a trustee, such as an attorney, in case either party defaults. 
</P>
<P>
While this theory sounds great, in practice the trustee has a difficult job 
deciding if there has been a breach serious enough to require forfeiture. 
</P>
<P>
As you can see, if all does not go well, equity sharing can become a mess. 
However, I do like equity sharing between parents and their adult children, 
since everyone has known each other for at least 20 years. This is far safer 
than equity sharing among strangers. Further details are in my special report, 
"How Equity Sharing Works, Especially Between Parents and Their Adult 
Children," available for $3.50 from Newspaperbooks, 64 E. Concord St., Orlando, 
Fla. 32801.

APARTMENT LIFE: OWNER SHOULD RENT TO UNWED PAIR

QUESTION: My boyfriend and I are moving in together. After looking for the 
right place for two months, we finally found it right here in Manhattan Beach, 
where we now live. The problem is that the landlord says he would prefer not to 
rent to unmarried couples. Is that legal? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Refusing to rent to you because of your marital status is not legal in 
California under our state's fair housing laws. As long as you qualify for the 
apartment the owner is obliged to consider you as renters.

under its rent control law. One of my tenants is claiming that under the rent 
law I must paint her unit because she's been here for five years. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. You are asking about "maintenance standards," which are unique to the 
city of West Hollywood, where apartment owners are required to paint their 
tenants' apartments every four years. Los Angeles' version of rent control 
contains no similar provision. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood apartment owners are also required to replace their renters' 
carpets every seven years unless they can demonstrate to the rent control board 
that they do not need to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Last Month's Rent' a Security Deposit 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm moving from my Pasadena apartment of seven years next month and I have a 
problem. My rental agreement has a section that clearly says I have paid my 
last month's rent, which was $450 in 1982. Now the rent is $650 and my landlord 
wants me to pay the difference of $200. Do I have to pay this money or is my 
last month's rent paid? 
</P>
<P>
A: Because your landlord identified a portion of your security deposit as the 
"last month's rent," you need not pay the $200 difference. State law defines 
all deposits, including the last month's rent, as security deposits. However, 
any part of a deposit that is specifically designated, such as last month's 
rent, must be used for its designated purpose. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, if your landlord has identified $25 as "key deposit" and you 
return all the keys, he must refund that portion of the deposit to you, 
regardless of any unpaid rent or damages. 
</P>
<P>
Had your landlord identified the entire deposit he collected seven years ago as 
security deposit, which he could have done in the rental agreement, you would 
have to pay the full $650 for your last month's rent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Landlord Entitled to No-Show Deposit 
</P>
<P>
Q: I took a $100 deposit from a prospective renter to hold a vacant Los Angeles 
apartment off the market for him. He was to move in one week from the day I 
took the deposit and accepted him as a tenant. He changed his mind three days 
later, after I had taken down the "For Rent" signs and pulled my advertisement 
from the newspaper. May I keep the deposit? 
</P>
<P>
A: Since the prospective tenant was accepted and it was he who changed his 
mind, you may keep some or all of the deposit for your "liquidated damages." 
</P>
<P>
They include the following: the cost of readvertising the unit; the reasonable 
daily rental value of the premises, beyond the day the renter was to move into 
the unit until it is re-rented; any leasing fees, and any credit checking fees. 
</P>
<P>
If the prospect had qualified for the apartment and you subsequently changed 
your mind, for whatever reason, you would be required to refund the entire 
deposit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Landlord Can't Force Dog to Be Evicted 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a renter in Los Angeles. I've had my little dog for three years now and 
the landlord never seemed to mind. Now he wants to change the building's policy 
on pets, and he's demanding that I get rid of my dog. I would move before I 
would do that. The rental agreement states "No Pets," but it seems unfair to 
me. Should I start looking for another apartment? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you live in the city of Los Angeles you can probably unpack those boxes. 
If the landlord accepted rent for much more than a month and he knew about the 
pet, and it sounds like he did, he has waived his right to require you to get 
rid of your dog. 
</P>
<P>
He may prohibit any new renters moving in to the building from having pets, but 
he cannot evict you for keeping your dog if he has accepted the rent knowing of 
her presence. 
</P>
<P>
If you gave up your dog or it died, the landlord may prohibit you from getting 
a new pet, as long as he uniformly bans pets in the entire building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Extra Deposit Be Charged for Dog? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own an apartment building in Lomita. A tenant wants to get a dog. I don't 
mind, but I would like to get some additional security deposit in case the dog 
does a lot of damage. How much can I get? 
</P>
<P>
A: That depends on how much security deposit you've already got. State law 
allows you to collect two months' security deposit for unfurnished apartments 
and three months for furnished. That includes any deposit that you may choose 
to call "last month's rent." 
</P>
<P>
There is no provision in California law for any additional pet deposits if you 
are already collecting the maximum. If not, you may negotiate a "pet agreement" 
including additional deposit money up to the state limit.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: 'CIRCULAR' HOUSE MADE BY CONNECTING PANELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I have seen some very attractive circular-looking houses. I was 
wondering if they are very energy-efficient and expensive to have built or 
build myself? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You are referring to a panel-type of house that appears to be circular. 
Actually, it is a series of 8-foot long, heavily insulated wall panels that are 
connected. 
</P>
<P>
These types of houses are extremely energy efficient, both summer and winter, 
and are easy to build yourself. If you do much of the construction work 
yourself, the cost can be substantially reduced. 
</P>
<P>
The panels can be custom-made to your plans and delivered to your site. The 
most common insulation package includes fiberglass batting covered with 
insulated sheathing with an insulating value of R-19. You can order the panels 
with high-efficiency windows and doors already assembled in them. 
</P>
<P>
What is unique about these houses is that the roof is self-supporting. It is 
supported by a special truss system design, so there are no interior supporting 
walls required. 
</P>
<P>
This allows you to locate the interior walls wherever you desire. You have the 
option of making a very open floor plan for effective air-conditioning and 
heating with solar or space heaters. 
</P>
<P>
The circular shape improves energy efficiency for several reasons. With a 
circular shape, there is 15% less wall area for the interior floor space. This 
reduces heat gain in the summer and heat loss in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Winds tend to flow smoothly around the circular shape, reducing the pressure 
differences on the sides of the house. This minimizes air leakage into it and 
indoor drafts. The circular shape provides wall space for large windows in each 
room for effective passive solar heating. 
</P>
<P>
You can order a basic house plan kit or have one designed to your floor plans. 
The sizes can range from 600 square feet to more than 3,000 square feet. For 
additional space and unique designs, you can add rectangular rooms to the sides 
or combine several circular sections. 
</P>
<P>
With the circular shape and no tight corners on outside walls, you get more 
actual usable floor space than with a rectangular house. Therefore, you may be 
able to get by with less floor area than you had thought. That reduces your 
building costs and further reduces your utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 027, showing exterior diagrams 
and floor plans for four paneled circular house kits, building specifications 
and a list of circular house kit manufacturers. Please include $1 and a 
self-addressed business-sized envelope. Send your request to James Dulley, c/o 
Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244.

</P>
<P>
2 Slices or 4 Slices: What Does It Matter? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a large family and I was wondering if it is more energy efficient to 
use a two-slice or a four-slice toaster in the morning? We really eat a lot of 
toast. 
</P>
<P>
A: With most kitchen appliances, it is better to make larger quantities of food 
at one time. However, toasters are an exception. It doesn't really make much 
difference, other than in ending fights over the first few slices. 
</P>
<P>
Toasters brown the bread with radiant heat from the red-hot elements instead of 
cooking or baking it. Therefore, the residual heat in the toaster itself from 
adjacent slots doesn't have much effect. 
</P>
<P>

be sent to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati,

HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: TEST PLASTER WALL CRACK BEFORE STARTING REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We have a very old house with real plaster walls. A long crack 
recently showed up on the living room wall. Since the house is so old, we have 
ruled out the possibility of it being a settlement crack. We have checked with 
neighbors and find nobody else has the same problem. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: What might be called a resettlement sometimes can occur in an older 
house. Maybe some repairs were done by the community that have affected the 
soil under your house. There are other technical reasons why a settlement crack 
can take place even in an old house. 
</P>
<P>
If the crack doesn't get any larger or longer, you can patch the damage without 
much fear that the opening will reappear. One way to make a test is to mark the 
ends of the crack with chalk or any other marking material that can be erased. 
Wait a few weeks and see whether the crack is lengthening or widening. If it 
is, you will need a professional inspection and treatment. If not, go ahead 
with the patching. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Chimney Screen Cap Will Keep Out Animals 
</P>
<P>
Q: I've had trouble recently with birds and even a squirrel getting into our 
chimney. I have been told we should put a cap on the chimney. Is this something 
I can do myself? Won't the cap interfere with the draft? 
</P>
<P>
A: A cap is merely something that will keep out the animals, but permit air and 
smoke to move freely through the top of the chimney. You can make one yourself 
out of ordinary mesh. Attach it so it won't be disturbed by the wind or smoke, 
yet can be taken off and replaced if the need should arise. The need will arise 
if the mesh gets clogged with leaves or other debris. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Household Bleach Can Clean Dirty Tile Grout 
</P>
<P>
Q: The grout in a floor of clay tiles has become very dirty. We have washed it 
with soap and water without much result. Can the grout be painted? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, but it is a tedious task, since you will have to use an artist's brush 
and enamel that will resist water. Try using a household bleach. It usually 
does an excellent job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shellac-Alcohol Mix Will Vary as You Use It 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have never used shellac before, but expect to use it soon. How much 
denatured alcohol should be mixed with it? 
</P>
<P>
A: The mixture differs according to the use to which it will be put. Start with 
a 50-50 mixture. As you work with it, you will be able to make changes and 
judgements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Borax Will Remove Grime from Marble 
</P>
<P>
Q: Some time ago you told someone about going to a marble dealer and getting 
material for the removal of stains. I have no doubt this was good advice, but I 
thought you would be interested in knowing how my grandfather removed stains 
from marble. He applied borax to the stain, then rubbed it with a wet cloth. It 
always seemed to work. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thanks. This is an old solution, usually only for cleaning the marble of 
dirt and grime rather than stains. Dry borax is applied to the marble and then 
rubbed with a damp rag. The marble is then rinsed and buffed. But I repeat: 
This will clean the marble but may not affect a stain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adhesive Will Bond Hardboard to Wall 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am preparing to finish an attic. I intend to use prefinished hardboard. I 
was told the panels can be attached with a special wall adhesive if there is no 
moisture problem. There is no such problem in our attic. How is the adhesive 
applied? The panels will be attached to furring strips. 
</P>
<P>
A: Apply the adhesive in one-eighth- to one-quarter-inch beads. Get the 
adhesive where you buy the hardboard panels and you will get the proper kind. 
If it is not available there, tell another dealer how it will be used and ask 
him if he has a brochure on the proper use of the adhesive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Make a 'Tack Rag' or Buy One Instead 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have seen the expression "tack rag" used several times when the 
application of varnish is discussed. I understand it is for lifting up specks 
of dirt and dust that get on a newly varnished surface. Can you tell me how to 
make one? 
</P>
<P>
A: Take a piece of clean cloth and wring it out in lukewarm water. Then soak 
the rag in turpentine and wring it out. Put a little varnish on the rag, 
dripping it on slowly. Once again, wring out the rag. 
</P>
<P>
Apply more small quantities of varnish two or three times. Each time, wring it 
out. The tack rag is then ready for use. But you need not go to all this 
trouble if you don't mind spending a small amount for a professional tack rag. 
It is available in most hardware stores and home centers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Green Lumber OK If Shrinkage No Problem 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a project coming up where it will be necessary to use quite a bit of 
lumber. I presume I will save money if I use green or freshly cut lumber. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, but be sure it is the kind of project where wood shrinkage will not 
cause problems. Green lumber shrinks and causes all kind of construction 
problems if you are not aware of exactly what you are doing. If you aren't, the 
possibility of shrinkage is minimized when you use air-dried or kiln-dried 
lumber. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Is Spacing for Steel Reinforcing Rods 
</P>
<P>
Q: I want to build a retaining wall at the rear of our house. I will be using 
poured concrete and vertical reinforcing rods. How far apart should the rods be 
placed? 
</P>
<P>
A: Generally, every 2 feet. But you actually aren't going to have too much say 
about the matter. Your local codes will specify how the retaining wall should 
be built, including the kind of vertical rods that can be used and how far 
apart they should be. You will need a building permit. 
</P>
<P>
The techniques of using varnish, lacquer, shellac, bleach, stain, remover, 
etc., are detailed in Andy Lang's booklet, "Wood Finishing in the Home," which 
can be obtained by sending $1 and a long, stamped, self-addressed envelope to 
Know-How, P.O. Box 477, Huntington, N.Y. 11743. Questions of general interest 
will be answered in the column.

IN THE GARDEN: COOL NIGHTS: TIME FOR BROCCOLI, CAULIFLOWER; 
</P>
<P>
SAVE GROWING TIME BY USING TRANSPLANTS BUT PREPARE SOIL WELL FOR A BOUNTIFUL 
YIELD.

Fall is the prime time to grow broccoli and cauliflower in Southland gardens. 
Both love the bright days and cool nights of our autumn growing season. 
Gardeners new to our area often try to grow these vegetables in the spring -- 
the traditional growing time in most of the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
This is a mistake in all but the coastal areas of Southern California, as 
spring-grown broccoli and cauliflower often do not have time to form proper 
heads before bolting to seed. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this month, transplants for broccoli and cauliflower start showing up 
at local nurseries. You can save six to eight weeks of growing time by 
utilizing transplants. However, you have a wider selection of varieties by 
starting your own plants from seed. I suggest you do both: Plant some 
transplants this month, and also plant some seeds in pots for later 
transplanting into the garden. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli is a stately vegetable and its culinary uses are many and varied. 
Although broccoli was prized in Roman gardens over 2,000 years ago, its 
introduction to the United States occurred only 60 years ago when Italian 
settlers began its cultivation in the Santa Clara Valley. Its popularity 
increased rapidly and it is now a favored vegetable throughout the land. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli is an ideal crop for the home gardener. It is quite easy to grow, 
loaded with vitamins and minerals and produces terrific yields. 
</P>
<P>
Two old favorite broccoli varieties are heavy producers of side shoots, in 
addition to bearing large central heads. They are De Cicco and Calabrease, and 
although they are later to mature than hybrid varieties, their heavy production 
makes them a fine addition to your garden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tender Central Heads 
</P>
<P>
Among hybrid varieties, Premium Crop produces tender central heads up to 10 
inches across. Bonanza Hybrid and Green Goliath are recent introductions that 
are heavy producers. Early Emerald Hybrid is the earliest-maturing broccoli 
ever developed. 
</P>
<P>
Cauliflower is an elegant member of the cabbage family. By growing your own, 
you can be assured of truly fresh, pristine white heads and also sample some of 
the varieties not available in the market. 
</P>
<P>
While snow-white heads are most prized by cooks in this country, in Italy many 
cooks favor a purple-headed cauliflower. 
</P>
<P>
As far as I'm concerned, probably the best white cauliflower is a variety 
called Early Snowball A. It is a reliable producer of 3- to 4-pound heads of 
excellent quality. Seeds for Early Snowball A are usually available in seed 
racks and it is frequently the variety sold as bedding plants in nurseries and 
garden centers. 
</P>
<P>
Other good white cauliflower varieties include Snow Crown Hybrid which is a 
recent All-American Winner, Snow King Hybrid, which is an extremely early 
maturing variety and Early Snowball Y, a very vigorous producer of compact 
white heads. 
</P>
<P>
Purple-headed cauliflower is quite simple to grow and has several advantages 
over its white-headed cousins. It has a higher vitamin content, does not 
require blanching for whiteness and it holds its quality much longer when it 
reaches the harvest stage. The one disadvantage of purple cauliflower is that 
it takes longer to reach maturity than the white-headed types. 
</P>
<P>
The best home garden purple cauliflower is a variety called Purple Head. It 
produces heads of a beautiful purple hue when it is growing but when cooked, 
they turn a bright green. The flavor of Purple Head could be described as 
resembling the taste of traditional cauliflower blended with a mild broccoli 
flavor. Purple Head freezes better than white cauliflower. 
</P>
<P>
Purple Head is not available as transplants in nurseries and will have to be 
planted from seeds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prepare the Soil 
</P>
<P>
The culture is similar for broccoli and cauliflower. Plant broccoli and 
cauliflower transplants in an area that receives full sun. Prepare the soil by 
spading to a depth of 12 inches and work in a generous amount of compost or 
other organic materials. Both vegetables are heavy feeders. When preparing the 
soil, mix in 5 pounds of a 10-10-10 fertilizer per 100 square feet of soil area 
and then water thoroughly. Transplants should be spaced 12 inches apart, in 
rows 2 feet apart. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli and cauliflower are susceptible to transplant shock. Set out plants in 
the early evening when it is cooler and check them the next day. If they look 
droopy, you may need to shade them for a few days. Transplants should be 
watered during the transplanting process and then sprinkled for the next five 
days until they become established. After that, keep the plants watered on a 
regular basis and never allow the soil around them to dry out completely. 
</P>
<P>
Many become discouraged when growing broccoli, cauliflower or other cabbage 
family members because of cabbage worms. Don't let them discourage you; control 
them with products such as Dipel, Thuricide or Attack, which contain the 
biological insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis, which is harmless to 
warm-blooded creatures and beneficial insects. 
</P>
<P>
It is crucial that broccoli be harvested at the correct stage. The head should 
be cut while the buds are still small and the head is compact. Make sure you 
cut the heads before the buds start opening and the small yellow flowers 
appear. When cutting the heads, leave 3 or 4 inches of stem on them. 
</P>
<P>
If you are going to grow white-headed cauliflower, it is necessary to blanch 
the heads to keep them snow white. Blanching is accomplished by tying the outer 
leaves over the heads to prevent them from being exposed to the sun. It should 
take place when the immature heads reach a diameter of 2 to 3 inches. Purple 
cauliflower does not require blanching. 
</P>
<P>
Cauliflower should be harvested when the heads are smooth, solid and tight. As 
the heads enlarge, you should check under the blanching leaves often so that 
you can cut them at the proper time. 
</P>
<P>
When broccoli and cauliflower plants start to reach maturity, they tend to 
become a little top-heavy and it may pay you to tie them to stakes to prevent 
Santa Ana winds from uprooting them. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds for most broccoli and cauliflower varieties mentioned here should be 
available at local nurseries. Seeds for Purple Head cauliflower may be 
difficult to locate. They are available from Burpee Seeds, 300 Park Ave., 
Warminster, Pa. 18991.

FIVE BEST LOW-CASH WAYS TO FINANCE A HOME; 
</P>
<P>
MANY PROPERTIES CAN BE BOUGHT WITH SMALL DOWN PAYMENTS AND AN IMAGINATIVE 
APPROACH.

Many potential home buyers are so discouraged about ever owning a home that 
they have given up. Too many prospective homeowners think a down payment of at 
least 20% of the purchase price is required to buy a home. But that's not true. 
If you know the best sources of low-cash home financing you can buy with very 
little cash. 
</P>
<P>
However, not all of these methods will apply to every home. But you may be able 
to combine several techniques to purchase a home. That's why it is important to 
know these best methods and then determine which will work for the home you 
want to buy. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, if you want to buy a $200,000 home with zero cash, a new VA 
mortgage won't work because most lenders limit VA loans to only $144,000. 
However, several of the other low-cash techniques will work to finance a 
$200,000 home purchase. Or you may be able to combine a VA mortgage with a 
seller-financed mortgage. Here are today's five best low-cash home finance 
sources to consider:

Your best mortgage source. In these days of abundant but expensive home 
mortgage money, most home buyers and their realty agents have forgotten the 
home seller is, by far, the best home mortgage source. 
</P>
<P>
Advantages for buyers include low interest rate, no application fees or forms 
and easy financing. Seller benefits include welcome interest income higher than 
is available at local banks and savings and loans, safety of a mortgage on your 
former residence and an easy quick sale for top dollar. 
</P>
<P>
When buying any property, especially a home, always ask why the seller is 
selling. Often you will learn the seller is retiring and moving from the area. 
I find elderly home sellers are the best candidates for low-cash seller 
financing, especially if their home has been for sale several months and is 
vacant. You will be amazed how many elderly people own their homes free and 
clear with no mortgage and will gladly finance your purchase. 
</P>
<P>
But first you must ask. Please don't be discouraged if the realty agent says 
with great authority: "I know the seller won't help finance this sale." Until 
the seller sees a written offer on the table, which provides for the seller to 
carry back a first or second mortgage, nobody knows for sure if the seller will 
become the buyer's lender. 
</P>
<P>
FHA, VA and PMI mortgages. If you can't get the seller to finance your 
purchase, consider a new VA, FHA, or PMI (private mortgage insurance) home 
loan. The big advantage is low- or no-cash down payment. 
</P>
<P>
However, these loans have drawbacks. The maximum FHA loan is only $101,250 
(lower in some areas) and this is not enough in expensive areas such as most of 
California. But the FHA mortgage advantages are a down payment of less than 5% 
and a fixed-interest rate. Incidentally, the FHA maximum limit is expected to 
be raised later this year. 
</P>
<P>
VA mortgages, available to qualified veterans, require no cash down payment 
except for a 1% loan origination fee. The maximum VA loan is $144,000 from most 
lenders but legally there is no limit set by the Veterans Administration. With 
both VA and FHA loans, be sure the lender has automatic approval authority, 
otherwise loan approval can take forever. 
</P>
<P>
PMI home loans for 90% and 95% of the home purchase price are available from 
most banks and S&amp;Ls. However, many PMI companies have had heavy losses 
recently, so PMI borrowers need good income and good credit to qualify. But 
there are big differences among PMI companies, which insure lenders against 
losses on the loan amount above 80% loan to value. If you get rejected by one 
PMI company, apply for a loan with another lender who uses a different PMI 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Lease with an option to buy. My favorite way to finance a home purchase is to 
lease with an option to buy. That is how I acquired my personal residence. If I 
can do it, you can, too. This method works in all price ranges. For example, 
last week I heard from a reader who is lease-optioning a $600,000-house. 
</P>
<P>
Advantages for lease-option home buyers include locking in the option purchase 
price at today's market value, investing typically only $1,000 to $5,000 as 
non-refundable consideration for the option (this is much less than a customary 
down payment), negotiating a partial or full rent credit toward the down 
payment and keeping monthly costs below what it would cost to make monthly 
mortgage payments on the same property. 
</P>
<P>
Advantages for lease-option home sellers include nontaxable receipt and use of 
the option consideration money (it becomes taxable when either the option is 
exercised or the option expires unexercised), higher-quality tenant than 
ordinary renters, little or no management work and continued income tax 
deductions for mortgage interest, property taxes and depreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Assume an existing assumable mortgage. There are millions of existing assumable 
home loans such as VA, FHA and ARM (adjustable-rate mortgages). If the seller 
has little equity in the home you may be able to buy for very little cash. 
However, if the seller has a large equity, but you only have a small amount of 
down payment cash, don't hesitate to ask the seller to carry back a large 
second mortgage to fill the finance gap. 
</P>
<P>
Trade something you don't need for the down payment. If you own other real 
estate, such as a vacant lot or a costly toy such as a boat, recreational 
vehicle or exotic sports car, these can be traded as all or part of your home 
down payment. For example, a few weeks ago I was selling a house, and a 
prospective buyer drove up in a Porsche. He liked the house but didn't have 
enough cash for a down payment. When I suggested he trade his Porsche to me for 
the down payment, he couldn't bear to part with it. As a result, he is still a 
renter rather than a homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
There are many home finance sources in addition to the traditional 20% cash 
down payment and 80% conventional mortgage. With the help of a creative real 
estate agent and determined persistence, somehow, someway, you can acquire the 
home you want.

SOUTHERN PACIFIC MOVING ITS L.A. HEADQUARTERS TO MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major move is in progress as Southern Pacific Transportation Co. relocates to 
new headquarters in the Los Angeles Corporate Center in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The firm moves 6 miles east, after 80 years in the Pacific Electric Building at 
610 S. Main St., constructed in 1905 as Los Angeles' largest office building at 
10 stories high. 
</P>
<P>
The company signed a 10-year, $18-million lease for an 83,000-square-foot 
building in the 100-acre Corporate Center with Ellis Sloan Burnett Properties 
and Metropolitan Life Insurance, joint-venture partners in the development of 
the center. 
</P>
<P>
The move, Southern Pacific President Mike Mohan said, "is consistent with the 
streamlining of operations of the company, which involves redeployment of SP 
resources to carry out its business plan for the 1990s and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
About 350 Southern Pacific employees will settle into new offices this month 
and in early October, in a consolidation of some Southern California rail, real 
estate and administrative functions of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the Los Angeles Corporate Center lease, were handled by the 
Faulkner Co. of Los Angeles for Southern Pacific and by leasing representatives 
for Corporate Center for Ellis Sloan Burnett and Metropolitan Life.

Photo, COMMERCIAL SCENE -- Burbank project -- NBC has applied for planning 
approval for a substantially redesigned NBC Plaza adjacent to the NBC 
headquarters at 3000 W. Alameda Ave., Burbank. The $200-million development 
will be a joint venture of NBC and Cushman Investment and Development. Ellerbe 
Becket is the architect of the 798,000-square-foot project bounded by Olive 
Avenue, California Street and the Ventura (134) Freeway. NBC Plaza will consist 
of two towers -- a 17-story and a 21-story one -- along with shops, restaurants 
and two acres of open space. There will be five levels of underground parking, 
instead of the four above-grade in the original 1987 design. Once approvals are 
obtained, construction is expected to begin late next year, with a 1993 
completion, according to an NBC spokesman.

UNSOLD HOME INVENTORY STILL IS LOWEST IN DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unsold tract housing inventory in six Southland counties at the end of August 
was unchanged from six months ago, with 6,571 units, though that figure was 
down 26% from a year ago and still remains the lowest in the last decade, 
according to a survey released by the Real Estate Research Council of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Units under construction accounted for 81% of the inventory, and detached units 
represented 69% of these. 
</P>
<P>
Inventory of completed units dropped by 198 units to 1,266, while units under 
construction rose by 172 units, to 5,405. Detached units under construction 
rose 8%, while attached units under construction fell 7%. 
</P>
<P>
Unsold inventories increased in Orange, Ventura and San Diego counties but fell 
in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
Of the total unsold, Riverside County had 32%; San Diego County, 23%; Orange 
County, 19%; Los Angeles, 11%; San Bernardino, 9%, and Ventura, 7%. 
</P>
<P>
Of the total of unsold inventory, about 70% represented detached housing except 
in Orange County, where the figure was 56%, and in San Bernardino County, where 
it was more than 88%. 
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted from April through August at all active housing 
projects in the six counties, except in Central and West Los Angeles and the 
West San Gabriel Valley, by Market Profiles, a Costa Mesa research firm.
