NEWSMAKERS: A ROYAL TROUBLEMAKER SAYS SHE'S LEARNED HER LESSON

Fergie says she was a royal pain as a child. The Duchess of York didn't take 
issue with an old school report that described her as "slapdash, stubborn and 
headstrong." "I always tried to do things and not get caught," the former Sarah 
Ferguson said. "I put dye in the lavatory cistern and put glue on the teacher's 
chair because it was maths, and I didn't like maths." But the wife of Britain's 
Prince Andrew said that "when I finished up at school, I did work quite hard 
and I was becoming more responsible by the minute." Childhood troublemaking may 
not run in the family. The duchess said her 1-year-old daughter, Princess 
Beatrice, is a "placid, happy little girl."

 -- Medical researchers in Britain are angry that Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher has canceled government plans for the country's biggest sex survey 
because she believes that it would violate privacy. The $1.2-million survey 
would have asked 20,000 adults explicit questions about their sex lives. Kaye 
Wellings, a health researcher, complained: "This is not a survey motivated by 
prurient curiosity into people's private lives." Researchers believe that the 
project would have provided valuable information for the fight against AIDS.

 -- If your name were going down in history, you'd want it to be legible. 
Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh has replaced his official signature, affixed 
mechanically to thousands of documents he doesn't have time to sign. The 
abandoned signature was described as an "E" and two squiggles plus a "B" and 
two loops. Bayh said that a penmanship teacher had told him he should sign his 
name more carefully, and that a high school student he once gave an autograph 
said: "Come on, what's that?" The new official signature contains all eight 
letters of the governor's name.

 -- As the New York Democratic primary nears, singer Paul Simon added his voice 
to the supporters of City Council President David N. Dinkins, saying: "It's 
time for a change" after three terms served by Mayor Edward I. Koch. Dinkins 
responded: "With his help -- and the aid of all New Yorkers -- we will build 
bridges over the troubled waters of this great but pained city." Meanwhile, a 
new Daily News/WABC-TV poll showed Dinkins leading Koch 51% to 44%. DAVE

FALCONS HAVE SOUND BUT THE RAMS GENERATE FURY IN 31-21 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

ATLANTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deion Sanders looked skyward for his first professional punt return -- and 
dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Freon Sanders? You wish. Before he was finished, he had supercharged 
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium with one stunning 68-yard flash dance for a 
touchdown, leaving trinkets and tacklers (James Washington, Anthony Newman and 
Robert Delpino) in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders shook his fists, the rafters, the crowd of 38,708. Deion shook the 
football world. Just ask him. He also seemed to shake up the Rams, who were 
going through the motions before Sanders zapped them back to reality with his 
first-quarter punt-return. 
</P>
<P>
So inspired, the Rams rallied with some flash of their own and gained a 31-21 
season-opening victory over the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
Say what you want about Sanders, the first-round pick who ended his holdout 
Thursday, left the New York Yankees in mid-game and headed south for Atlanta. 
Everyone else does. 
</P>
<P>
"Deion hasn't done nothing," Ram defensive end Shawn Miller said. "He returned 
a punt. The final thing's up on the scoreboard. He can jump up and down all he 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Tom Newberry: "I think Brian Bosworth started this whole thing. It made 
him so much money. I think all the agents out there say, 'Hey, if you get a 
draft pick pretty high, you can do this and that and then write a book.' I just 
look at it as a production. I don't give a . . . what he does." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Sanders inspired those around him -- on both sides. He moved tailback Greg 
Bell to 128 grueling yards and then afterward, words. Bell hadn't spoken to the 
press since ending his summer holdout less than two weeks ago. But you can't 
sit there and let someone from the losing team steal all your thunder. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Bell's performance spoke volumes, considering he has been in pads 
only days and was supposed to share tailback duties with Gaston Green. Instead, 
Bell re-established his place in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an outstanding back today," Coach John Robinson said of Bell. "That was 
as good a performance under the circumstances that I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
Bell carried 26 times in the heat and humidity, scoring on touchdown runs of 
two and eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
Was he surprised? 
</P>
<P>
"You're surprised," Bell told reporters. "I'm not. You've seen me this summer. 
I've prepared to do one thing, and that's to carry the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Bell's off-season conditioning program was excruciating, proving again the 
relative insignificance of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I prepared for training camp in May and June," Bell said. "The only thing I 
missed was the soreness I have now." 
</P>
<P>
The game changed after Sanders' run, which struck like lightning with 9:29 
remaining in the first quarter. It gave the Falcons, who hadn't scored an 
offensive touchdown against the Rams since the strike game in 1987, a reason to 
play on. It gave the Rams a reason to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
Their sloppiness was never more apparent than on Sanders' run, which would have 
never happened had the Rams not commited a penalty on the first punt, forcing a 
re-kick. 
</P>
<P>
On his second chance, Sanders fumbled the ball at his own 32, picked it up, 
avoided Washington, circled back to the right, avoided Newman, outran Delpino 
and high-kicked his way down the middle of the field, taunting Buford McGee on 
his way to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got in the open it was prime time," Sanders said. "I said to myself, 
boy, what have you done? I thought it would be nice to break one. I felt like a 
deer with a hundred hunters around." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, who had whipped the crowd into a frenzy by waving his his arms in the 
air before each return, put the Falcons ahead, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Rams were shaking off cobwebs. Quarterback Jim Everett was 
nervous in the beginning and threw accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was uptight," he said. "Maybe it was the expectations of the regular 
season." 
</P>
<P>
He settled down in the second quarter, after Darryl Henley returned a punt 16 
yards to the Atlanta 46. 
</P>
<P>
That was for you, Deion. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't let that happen," Henley said of Sander's performance. "He's running 
the show out here. Our punt return team came over to me and said we're going to 
break one." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams drove in and scored on Bell's two-yard run to give them a 10-7 lead 
early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
As the half drew to a close, however, Falcon quarterback Chris Miller burned 
Henley on a deep pass to Floyd Dixon, who scored on the 47-yard play. 
</P>
<P>
That was for you, Darryl. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams took the ball back with 42 seconds left and drove quickly on an 
eight-yard run by Bell and an 11-yard pass from Everett to Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Time was running short, however. So with nine seconds left, Everett heaved a 
desperation pass toward the end zone, where Ram receivers Henry Ellard, Flipper 
Anderson and Aaron Cox converged. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard, who high jumped 6 feet 10 inches in college, leaped above the crowd of 
receivers and defenders and hauled the ball in for a touchdown as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard didn't know who was around him. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see jerseys, I just saw hands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had stolen the lead, and the Falcons would not recover. Everett made 
sure of it. 
</P>
<P>
He took the Rams down field in the third quarter, risking life, limb, and 
possibly the season. On third and five at the Falcon 28, Everett left the 
pocket and did a hook-slide for seven yards. He was clubbed in the helmet on 
the tackle and dazed. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later from the 13, Everett scrambled again, only this time he 
bowled head-first over safety Robert Moore for the touchdown, giving the Rams a 
24-14 lead with 9:01 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Everett said he actually was using his head when he used his head. When did he 
have the urge to dive? 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw it was a number 30 and no number higher than that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson watched the play in horror. 
</P>
<P>
"He gives us a little more depth at tailback," he joked afterward. "I think 
quarterbacks should play that way." 
</P>
<P>
You wanted to believe him. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams left no doubt about the game when they scored again early in the 
fourth quarter on Bell's eight-yard run around left end, capping a 74-yard 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
Miller took advantage of another inexperienced Ram corner, Cliff Hicks, on his 
33-yard scoring pass to Michael Haynes with 9:24 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But it was too late. Not even Sanders, who was also used at free safety, could 
save the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
And except for the two costly errors by the corners, the Rams' Eagle defense 
dominated, holding Atlanta to 46 net yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Miller threw for a career-high 229 yards, but was sacked five times, three 
times by linebacker Kevin Greene. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a good day today," Greene said. "I needed to come out firing bullets. 
And I was lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Miller, the defensive end, batted down three Miller passes. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, Neon or no Neon, once again proved too much. Sanders, however, did 
leave an impression. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's on your team, he's great," Henley said. "If he's not, you want to kill 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gaston Green carried four times for seven yards. Greg Bell wouldn't let him in 
the game. "The guy had such a dominant game it was hard to take him out," Coach 
John Robinson said. . . . Jim Everett completed 14 of 25 passes for 206 yards 
with one touchdown and no interceptions. . . . Deion Sanders returned only two 
punts on the day for a total of 83 yards. The Rams kicked away from him in the 
second half.

CHARGERS WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON AFTER 40-14 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday was the day the Chargers were supposed to open the regular season. They 
instead opened Pandora's Box. 
</P>
<P>
Their offense was soft. Their defense was flat. Their special teams were 
thoroughly askew. And their post-game explanations were crooked after the 
Raiders stabbed the heart of a franchise full of hope with a 40-14 victory at 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers punctured their own credibility when their coach, Dan Henning, and 
their starting quarterback, Jim McMahon, couldn't agree on why Henning removed 
McMahon from the game in the third period and whether or not McMahon was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
In shorthand form, the depositions went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yes, McMahon said, he bruised his ribs late in the third quarter one play 
before Marion Butts' one-yard touchdown run cut the Raider lead to 28-14. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No, he said, he didn't ask to leave the game before the Chargers' next 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yes, he said, he was told he would be leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No, backup quarterback David Archer said, McMahon requested to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yes, Henning said, "He (McMahon) indicated to me he could go back in the 
ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 -- No, Henning said, the doctors did not tell him McMahon couldn't return. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yes, several Chargers said, we knew McMahon was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No, several others said, we had no idea. 
</P>
<P>
Sounded like a Barnaby Jones rerun. 
</P>
<P>
But the Raiders were the ones who weren't supposed to have a clue. They had 
lost all four of their exhibitions and four of their final five regular-season 
games last year. Their starting quarterback, Jay Schroeder, suffered a 
separated left shoulder on the first offensive play of the game. And he didn't 
return after the first series, which ended with a 26-yard touchdown pass to 
wide-open running back Vance Mueller. 
</P>
<P>
The player Mueller beat was inside linebacker Jim Collins. The list of Charger 
defenders who subsequently joined Collins in an afternoon full of embarrassment 
was a long one. 
</P>
<P>
"We just played terrible," said free safety Vencie Glenn. "Lousy. Plain and 
simple." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't recall a game where the outcome has differed so greatly from the 
expectations coming in," said Ron Lynn, the defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"I stunk the place up," said cornerback Sam Seale, beaten badly by Raider wide 
receiver Willie Gault on the 39-yard touchdown pass in the third period that 
increased the lead to 28-7. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not ready enough on offense yet to combat the mistakes we made on 
defense," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
That part he had right. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders ran over and around the Charger defense for 418 yards. Schroeder 
completed two of three passes for 79 yards and will probably return next week 
in Kansas City. His replacement, Steve Beuerlein, connected on 15 of 22 for 206 
yards and two touchdowns. McMahon managed just seven of 18 for 91 yards; Archer 
five of 11 for 62. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers answered the Raiders' initial touchdown midway through the first 
period with a burst off left guard by rookie running back Butts. Butts, 248 
pounds, received important blocks from right guard David Richards, starting 
center Courtney Hall and left guard Broderick Thompson before easily outrunning 
the Raider secondary. 
</P>
<P>
It was the longest Charger run for a touchdown since Lionel James raced 56 for 
a score against Cincinnati four years ago. "Basically," Butts said, "I was 
untouched." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders broke that tie 15 plays, 78 yards and 7:33 later when wide receiver 
Mervyn Fernandez found an open spot in the right corner of the end zone on 
third and two from the four. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows?" Seale said. "He may have even been my man, too. That's how bad it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers special teams were worse. For starters, Lewis Colbert's net 
punting average after four kicks was 24.0 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Fernandez's touchdown, a poorly blocked Jamie Holland kickoff return 
backed the Chargers up to their own 11. A short Colbert punt gave the Raiders 
the ball at the Charger 49. Nine plays after that, Marcus Allen, who missed all 
of training camp in a salary dispute, dived over from the one. 
</P>
<P>
Holland also muffed the second-half kickoff, and the Chargers started at their 
own five. Colbert's 36-yard punt preceded a 29-yard return by Tim Brown that 
preceded Gault's undressing of Seale. 
</P>
<P>
"Very sporadic," Henning said when asked about his special teams. 
</P>
<P>
Before the period was over, rookie Wayne Walker would field a Raider punt at 
the six. He said the coaches told him not to return anything inside the 10. 
But, he added, "I'd do the same thing over if I had the chance. I was trying to 
make something happen." 
</P>
<P>
Four plays before that, the Chargers were caught with 12 men on the field when 
rookie Burt Grossman thought the Raiders were trying a field goal. They were 
punting. He isn't on the punt-return unit. 
</P>
<P>
"I was confused," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
Colbert's next punt was a 38-yarder that gave the Raiders the ball on the 
Charger 35. Only a missed field goal prevented the Raiders from increasing 
their lead to 17 points. Kicker Jeff Jaeger atoned for that miss with a 
22-yarder early in the final period following yet another short Colbert punt. 
</P>
<P>
The comedy of errors continued. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing kickoff, Charger rookie Victor Floyd mishandled the ball, 
finally picked it up and retreated from the oncoming pursuit. Ex-Charger Timmie 
Ware and Stefon Adams caught up to him in the end zone for a safety that made 
the score 33-14. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy to score five points on consecutive plays. But that's what 
Floyd's mistake enabled the Raiders to do. "He (Floyd) thought he was in the 
end zone when he picked up the ball," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
If that was the case, why didn't Floyd just down it? 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders almost made it three consecutive scoring plays when Adams 
momentarily broke free on the subsequent free kick. His 27-yard return set up 
the Raiders at the Charger 37, from where Beuerlein directed the final scoring 
drive. Mueller's one-yard dive and Jaeger's extra point accounted for the 
game's final points. 
</P>
<P>
More than one Charger said the team will recover and learn from what happened 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But, Henning said, "I'd rather have this game somewhere other than under my 
belt." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Charger running back Marion Butts led all rushers Sunday with 64 yards 
on nine carries. Marcus Allen topped the Raiders with 51 yards on 13 attempts. 
. . . Raider Willie Gault's four catches netted 131 yards. . . . Charger 
quarterback Jim McMahon said no X-rays were taken on his bruised ribs. . . . 
McMahon, who came to the Chargers with the league's best record as a starter 
(46-15). is 0-1 as a Charger starter. . . . The 40 points scored by the Raiders 
was the second-most against the Chargers in the past 32 games. The 49ers scored 
48 against them late last year. . . . Don Macek took over for rookie starter 
Courtney Hall at center in the third period. But Hall returned in the final 
quarter. . . . McMahon was one of the Chargers' game captains for the pregame 
coin toss. . . . Rod Bernstine and Anthony Miller led the Chargers with three 
receptions apiece.

RAIDERS PUT ON GAME FACES, SACK CHARGERS, 40-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who were those guys? 
</P>
<P>
The wise guys were measuring Mike Shanahan for concrete boots and his team for 
a similar, if deferred, fate. Instead the Raiders, awakening as if from a long 
midsummer's nightmare, turned around and obliterated the hapless San Diego 
Chargers, 40-14, Sunday before 40,237 in the Coliseum in the first must-win 
season opener in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
It was their most one-sided victory in four seasons and their stars were 
legion: Steve Beuerlein going 15-for-22 subbing for the injured Jay Schroeder; 
Schroeder leading a touchdown drive in his only possession; Marcus Allen 
reviving the running game; Willie Gault; the new offensive line, the new 
defense, etc. etc. 
</P>
<P>
Are we talking timely? 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders were 0-4 in the exhibition season, 1-4 at the end of last season. 
After the game, Shanahan went so far as to say, "Our backs were up against the 
wall." 
</P>
<P>
This would would be the earliest date ever for such a predicament and a lot to 
say. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If it weren't so true. 
</P>
<P>
"Around here, that's a lot to say?" said Beuerlein, bursting into laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon man, you know better than that. I even know that much." 
</P>
<P>
This is how the day began: 
</P>
<P>
On NBC's network pregame show, Alameda County commissioner Don Peralta 
announced the Oakland Coliseum was increasing its bid for the franchise to $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
On CBS, Will McDonough, an Al Davis confidante, reported that no less than 
three general managers had told him that Davis had been close to firing 
Shanahan before the season and replacing him with Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
And they hadn't even had the coin toss yet. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders won that and before you could say "Just like preseason," they were 
looking at third-and-nine. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' Leslie O'Neal had already body-slammed Schroeder on the first 
play. Schroeder was now operating with a separated left shoulder, although no 
one knew that yet. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens? 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder launches a bomb far down the middle of the field, 53 yards to Gault 
who has just toasted ex-Raider cornerback Sammy Seale. On the next play, 
Schroeder hits Vance Mueller across the middle and going in on a 26-yard 
scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
Out came the Raider defense. 
</P>
<P>
Before you could say "Just like in preseason," the fledgling Charger offense 
blasted 85 yards down the field for a 7-7 tie, the last 50 yards on rookie 
fullback Marion Butts' bolt into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens? 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders hold them to a respectable 239 yards the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein, making his 1989 debut a lot earlier than he was figuring on, ("I was 
shocked"), pulled himself together and marched the Raiders 78 yards for a 
touchdown in his second possession. He took them 49 for a touchdown in his 
third. Along the way, he converted five consecutive third downs. On the last 
drive, he picked up a two third-and-nines plus a second-and-14. He was, all in 
all, semi-brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
It was 21-7 at the half. The first time Beuerlein touched the ball in the 
second half, he buzzed a 39-yard touchdown pass to Gault who was once again 
behind Seale. It was 28-7 and time for an extended mop-up period. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to come with the deep balls to his (Seale's) side because of the way 
he plays them," Beuerlein said. "He doesn't seem to respect them as much as 
Gill Byrd on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
"Willie can run. We've known that for a long time but it's great to see him 
playing with so much confidence. He doesn't think anybody can stop him. As a 
quarterback, you've got a guy you know is gonna burn 'em every time. You know 
you can put it out there and he'll go get it." 
</P>
<P>
If the Raiders were rolling, the Chargers were unraveling for all they were 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
Their 3-1 exhibition season rendered irrelevant, their bubble pierced, and they 
went to great lengths to show just how young they are. 
</P>
<P>
Their punt-cover team sent 12 men onto the field in the third period -- one too 
many. The Raiders had a first down. 
</P>
<P>
The kids were only warming up. 
</P>
<P>
With the Raiders ahead, 31-14, young returner Victor Floyd took Jeff Jaeger's 
kickoff in the end zone, fumbled it out to the two, picked it up . . . and 
retreated back into the refuge of the end zone? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you can't do that. Stefon Adams, a special-teams demon all day, 
tackled him there for a safety and it was 33-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers were obliged to kick. New punter Lewis Colbert (the 
unhappy-with-his contract Ralf Mojsiejenko had been traded to Washington) got 
off a short kick, Adams returned it 27 yards and the Raiders were back in 
business at the Charger 37. 
</P>
<P>
From there, it took Beuerlein eight plays to score. Mueller carried on six of 
those, flying the last yard on a plunge over the middle. The rout was complete. 
</P>
<P>
Were the Raiders happy? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a situation where you have a team that's still trying to find 
itself," Vann McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think wins like this make it so you can actually go in the huddle and start 
shaking hands and knowing each other. I mean, it's like you're still trying to 
get everybody's first name down." 
</P>
<P>
Said Beuerlein: "We can be this good on a consistent basis. You look across the 
board, I think we've got people on both sides of the ball who can match up with 
anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't sure. We've got a lot of new faces, a lot of guys trying to get 
things going. I think now that it's going a little bit, that confidence is 
going to help us jell." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from that, it was your routine Raider opening-day victory. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Punky Quarterback's First Charger Controversy: Chargers Coach Dan Henning 
lifted Jim McMahon under unusual circumstances, McMahon having just led a 
third-period touchdown drive. Henning said McMahon was not hurt "to my 
knowledge." McMahon said he had suffered bruised ribs and had been told to come 
out. Substitute quarterback David Archer said McMahon asked to come out. Stay 
tuned. . . . The great Raider negative of the day: Tim Brown hurt his left knee 
on a punt return. X-rays were inconclusive and Brown was to undergo an MRI 
Sunday night. . . . Jay Schroeder says his separated left shoulder isn't 
serious and he expects to play next week at Kansas City. In case you're 
wondering, Mike Shanahan said he is still No. 1 if he s healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder returned to the sideline after getting X-rays and tried to return to 
the game, too. "Mike said, 'We've only got two guys standing here who can play 
that position, so you'd better wait," Schroeder said. . . . Who was the 
emergency No. 3 quarterback? Shanahan asked Marcus Allen if he was ready. Allen 
said he was. . . . The Raiders didn't even dress Scott Davis (hyperextended 
knee), and used the other starting defensive end Howie Long (ankle sprain) only 
on passing downs. Their best days could still be ahead of them. . . . The 
Raider victory was their biggest since they beat the Jets, 31-0, here in the 
'85 opener.

NO PITCHER IS SAFE AS PADRES LOSE 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The door to Manager Jack McKeon's office was closed Sunday after the Padres' 
14-8 thrashing by the Dodgers. Reporters were kept out. Teammates wondered who 
was inside. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after about five minutes, the door opened. Dennis Rasmussen, the 
afternoon's starting pitcher, stepped out, not pausing to stop as he walked 
through the clubhouse, through the tunnel, and into the San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he had been taken out of the game more than two hours before its 
brutal conclusion, Rasmussen's temper still was burning. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he wasn't sure what angered him more: that McKeon pulled him out of a 
2-2 game with one out in the third or the explanation he received for the move. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he's tired of watching me pitch behind in the count and not 
challenging people," said Rasmussen, who had been taken out of the game earlier 
just once in his previous 29 starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
Did he believe that? 
</P>
<P>
"Hell no," he said. "I don't buy it." 
</P>
<P>
Why then was he taken out? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why, I really don't." 
</P>
<P>
Did he think it was a panic move, particularly considering what happened after 
the departure? 
</P>
<P>
"You can go ask No. 15 why, and if he felt it was a panic move." 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 is McKeon, and he reiterated exactly what he had told Rasmussen to his 
face minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think he was throwing the ball good at all," McKeon said. "I wasn't 
going to take any more chances. (Mark) Grant and (Greg) Harris are well-rested, 
they've been doing a superior job." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble was, as Rasmussen explained: "It was just ugly after I left. Mud 
(Grant) didn't pitch very well, and nobody else got the job done either." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, yielding a season-high 19 hits and giving up more yardage on three 
homers and three doubles than the Chargers, dropped to six games behind 
division-leading San Francisco with the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Though not devastating ("Hey, I didn't think we were going to win 20 in a row," 
McKeon said), the Padres can't afford any more defeats at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
This is why it was so frustrating to leave prematurely, Rasmussen said. If he 
had been allowed to remain, he said, who knows? Perhaps the outcome would have 
been different. At least, he said, he's confident the suspense would have 
lasted beyond the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, the Dodgers had an 8-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
By the fifth, when the Dodgers heaped on four more runs, even Padre owner Joan 
Kroc had had enough and left her private box. 
</P>
<P>
And by the sixth, when the Dodgers had a 14-4 lead, the only part of the 
stadium that remained faithful were the Navy lads in Section 15, who apparently 
had no way to get home. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, judging by the crowd -- 19,342 -- you'd have thought the Padres were 
playing a spring-training game in Yuma, not the Dodgers in the midst of a 
pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
The way it turned, well, people weren't so sure. There were 35 players in the 
game, 19 by the Padres, and the only pitcher to throw more than than three 
innings was Dodger starter Ramon Martinez (4-3). 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' only regulars were first baseman Eddie Murray and third baseman 
Jeff Hamilton. The rest of the lineup had accumulated just seven homers and 71 
RBIs all season. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, who previously had won three consecutive decisions, and four of his 
past five, made a critical mistake early, throwing a fastball down the middle 
to Mickey Hatcher on a three-and-one pitch in the first. He promptly deposited 
it over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
It was really nothing new for Rasmussen, who has allowed 27 runs in the first 
inning this season. But he settled down, striking out Murray and Hamilton. He 
breezed through the second. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the third, an inning that Rasmussen said left him more frustrated 
than at any time this season. That's quite a concession, considering that this 
is the same guy who opened the season winning just two of his first 15 starts. 
</P>
<P>
The inning opened with Martinez hitting a zero-and-two pitch up the middle for 
a single. Jose Gonzales forced Martinez for the first out, and it looked as if 
Dave Anderson was the second out when he hit a popup into foul territory near 
the stands by first base. Oops. Jack Clark dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
Given another chance, Anderson singled to center, bringing up Hatcher with one 
out and two on. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, remaining calm, stood on the mound, contemplating what he wanted to 
throw to Hatcher. He had a .294 career batting average against Rasmussen, but 
until the first inning had never hit a home run off him in 33 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Trying now to regain his concentration, Rasmussen was interrupted when he saw 
pitching coach Pat Dobson strolling to the mound. Perhaps he was going to offer 
a little advice, Rasmussen figured. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Grant coming in from the bullpen 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," he said. "I didn't get another chance. I was gone. 
Obviously, he didn't think I could get Hatcher out." 
</P>
<P>
Grant, who had been scored upon in just one of his past seven outings, made the 
maneuver look good at the outset, striking out Hatcher while Rasmussen watched 
from the stadium tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Next up was Eddie Murray, who obviously was happy that he now was facing a 
right-handed pitcher instead of left-handed Rasmussen. A switch-hitter, Murray 
is much more dangerous against right-handers -- .269 with 12 homers and 57 RBIs 
vs. .208 with four homers and 20 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres found this out the hard way, watching Murray blast a 400-foot home 
run into the right-center field seats, turning a 2-2 tie into a 5-2 Dodger 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"If I remember right what happened in the first inning, I struck out Murray," 
Rasmussen said sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
One inning later, the Dodgers scored three more off Grant, including a leadoff 
homer by Rick Dempsey. Grant was lifted after yielding five consecutive hits. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to win, I'm trying hard to help the team win," Rasmussen said. 
"It's hard to do that when you're taken out of a ballgame in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that it was my game. My 'L.' " 
</P>

TONIGHT'S GAME

<P>
New York Giants at Washington, 6 p.m., Channel 7 -- Super Bowl memories are 
fading fast for the New York Giants and Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' current roster features 14 players who didn't play against the 
Redskins when the teams opened the season last year. Washington, meanwhile, 
released several old-timers and imported nearly a dozen fresh faces in an 
effort to improve on last season's 7-9 finish. 
</P>
<P>
The results of both team's off-season housecleaning will be on display when the 
Giants and Redskins open their season at RFK Stadium. The game will kick off 
the 20th anniversary of ABC's Monday Night Football. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants enter the game without 22 of the players who excelled in the 1986 
season, when New York won its only Super Bowl. Gone are Harry Carson, George 
Martin, Jim Burt and several other members of what once was a stellar defense. 
Lawrence Taylor and Carl Banks are still around, but their linebacking 
companions include former free agents Steve DeOssie and Johnie Cooks. The 
offensive line is young and the defense is woefully lacking in depth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still in transition, without question," Coach Bill Parcells said. "The 
idea is to not slip too far while you're doing it." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants won 10 games last year, but missed the playoffs for a second 
straight year. 
</P>
<P>
"When you lose Carson and Martin and Burt and Kenny Hill and replace them with 
guys who haven't played, there's going to be a dropoff," Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, Super Bowl champions two seasons ago, slumped miserably last year. 
Too many turnovers, too many injuries and too many close losses left the 
Redskins out of the playoffs for the first time since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to turn things around, Gibbs said goodbye to veterans Dave Butz, 
Mel Kaufman and R.C. Thielemann and welcomed a host of rookies, including two 
12th-round picks, running back Joe Mickles and tight end Jimmie Johnson. The 
biggest change occurred on offense, where trades enabled the Redskins to 
acquire Gerald Riggs and Earnest Byner.

<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW FACES 
</P>
<P>
How the top rookie's fared in their debuts: 
</P>
<P>
Troy Aikman of Dallas, the first pick in the NFL draft, completed 18 of 35 
passes for 180 yards and was intercepted twice in the Cowboys' 28-0 loss to New

<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paul Frazier, a free agent out of Northwestern Louisiana, an NCAA Division 1-AA

victory over Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tim Worley of Pittsburgh lost three fumbles and managed only 36 yards in 10

<P>
</P>
<P>
Shawn Collins of Atlanta, the 27th selection in the draft out of Northern 
Arizona, had six receptions for 76 yards in the Falcons' 31-21 loss to the Los 
Angeles Rams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW PLACES 
</P>
<P>
Some familiar faces who made their debuts in new surroundings Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charger quarterback Jim McMahon, acquired from the Chicago Bears on Aug. 18, 
had a 35-3 record as a starter in regular-season games since 1984. But he 
completed only 7 of 18 passes for 91 yards without an interception against the 
Raiders and was replaced by David Archer midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dan Henning's debut as Charger coach was equally inauspicius. The Raiders 
scored first and trampled the San Diego defense for 418 yards in total offense 
in a 40-14 win. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Johnson downplayed the significance of his regular-season debut after 
Dallas' 28-0 loss. "I didn't think of it as a first game," said Johnson, who 
replaced the fired Tom Landry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
George Seifert guided the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers to 
a 30-24 victory over Indianapolis, then confessed: "There's a lot more pressure 
on that sideline than I realized." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bud Carson fielded a revamped Cleveland defense that forced eight turnovers and 
produced the most one-sided game in the history of the Browns' rivalry with 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denver converted four Kansas City turnovers into 24 points to continue overcome 
the Chiefs and new Coach Marty Schotenheimer, the former Cleveland coach who is 
now 0-5 against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BIG PLAYS 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kelly scored on a two-yard run with no time remaining to lift Buffalo to a 
27-24 victory at Miami. It was Kelly's first NFL rushing touchdown. Kelly set 
up the score by completing five of six passes on the game-winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Al Del Greco converted a 33-yard field goal with 13 seconds remaining to list 
Phoenix to a 16-13 victory over Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reggie Dupard scored on a four-yard run with 1:55 remaining as New England held 
on to defeat the Ney York Jets, 27-24, after blowing a 21-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mike Tomczak threw a 20-yard scoring pass to James Thornton in the fourth 
quarter to lift Chicago past Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Derrick Shepard scored on a 56-yuard point return to highlight New Orleans' 
shutout victory over Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo won its fifth consectuive game against Miami. . . . The Dolphins have 
lost 10 consecutive games to AFC East Division teams. . . . The Bills snapped 
Miami's 13-game winning streak in home openers, longest in the NFL. . . . New 
Orleans posted its first shutout in an opener with a 28-0 win over Dallas. . . 
. The Cowboys were shut out for the first time in the regular season since 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Seattle receiver Steve Largent sustained a small fracture of his right elbow 
and did not return after intermission in the Seahawks' 31-7 loss to 
Philadelphia. Before leaving, Largent caught his 98th career touchdown, one shy 
of the NFL record held by Green Bay's Don Hutson. Seattle Coach Chuck Knox said 
Largent would be sidelined for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raider quarterback Jay Schroeder separated his left 6ollarbone on the Raiders' 
first possession and was replaced by Steve Beuerlein. Later, the Raiders said 
Schroeder could have returned to the game if needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Houston guard Mike Munchak played only the first half because of an Achilles 
tendon injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes on rookie Barry Sanders: "This young man will 
restore the roar. He's everything we thought he was. . . . Hopefully, he'll 
make me a great coach." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly: "I don't think anyone in this (interview) room 
could have said the Buffalo Bills were going to come back in the last few 
minutes. The only person who knew that was me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh offensive guard Tom Ricketts after the Steelers' 51-0 loss to 
Cleveland: "I've never been in a mess like this in my life."

EVEN NEW COWBOYS GET BLUES AS SAINTS ARE SUPERB, 28-0

NEW ORLEANS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They have long memories in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
They remember Jean Lafitte, Huey Long, and Archie Manning. They remember the 
September day that the temperature was 124 on an outdoor playing field, the day 
that Manning won his opening game as a rookie quarterback in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
In the last second that sweltering afternoon, as thousands cheered, the young 
pro from Ole Miss ran the last yard to upset the Rams by four points. 
</P>
<P>
So New Orleans will doubtless remember Troy Aikman's first performance as a 
National Football League quarterback Sunday. Aikman surely will. 
</P>
<P>
Although the No. 1 draft choice from UCLA played well enough, the Cowboys were 
shut out before an overflow crowd at the Superdome, where the New Orleans 
Saints breezed, 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
Staying even with the Rams and 49ers in the warmly competitive NFC West, the 
Saints won by taking a 21-0 first half lead and a defense that held Dallas to 
20 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Behind quarterback Bobby Hebert the Saints drove 74, 73 and 89 yards to three 
touchdowns and also scored on a punt return to embarrass the heirs to America's 
Team: the rookie coach, Jimmy Johnson, and the rookie owner, Jerry Jones, not 
to mention Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a much better team than this," Johnson said after his linemen had been 
dominated on offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman said much the same about the offense's part in a rout in which the 
Saints held the ball for 44 minutes 2 seconds, the Cowboys only 15:58. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how it felt to join the league on a day like this, the new leaders 
responded differently. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: "I didn't expect to walk in here, win the first game, and go on to win 
them all." 
</P>
<P>
Jones: "You don't get to be an NFL owner if you haven't learned to get kicked 
once in a while and get up the next day with a smile." 
</P>
<P>
Jones owns 88% of the Cowboys. The United States, which foreclosed on one of 
his partners, owns the other 12%, but couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman, who could, said: "One (game) doesn't make or break your season. Today 
we just didn't execute. (The Cowboys) didn't play well in any phase of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Most of them didn't, that's true. But if all had played as well as Aikman, 
there could have been a different winner. 
</P>
<P>
Again, as he did all summer, the tall, well-built Bruin quarterback looked more 
like a polished veteran than an NFL rookie. 
</P>
<P>
He threw a fourth quarter touchdown pass that was recalled on a penalty and 
lost three first downs on other penalties. He completed 17 of 35 attempts for 
180 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Heavily rushed, usually hurried, and sacked twice, Aikman threw mostly 
short-range passes with his customary accuracy. His three longest serious 
attempts were powerful, mid-range sideline passes of 20 to 24 yards -- one for 
the aborted touchdown, one dropped, the other also a bulls-eye. 
</P>
<P>
His longest throw wasn't serious. A 50-yarder on the last play of the half that 
was intercepted. His other interception came on a gamble on the game's last 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman's statistics were ruined by New Orleans' early lead, which prompted 
Dallas offensive coordinator David Shula to send in mostly pass calls 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"Our (first-quarter touchdown drive) seemed to take some starch out of them," 
New Orleans Coach Jim Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Aikman: "I think we gave up on the run a little early." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, defending Shula, said there wasn't much point in rushing because, "New 
Orleans' (defensive) strength is against the run." 
</P>
<P>
Proving it, the Saints quickly and continuously stuffed Herschel Walker, the 
principal Dallas ballcarrier, restricting him to 10 yards gained on eight 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Exempt Aikman's 13 yards on a scramble, the Saints held Dallas to seven yards 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
That left everything to Aikman's arm. 
</P>
<P>
"We got some heat on (Aikman) from our standard defense," Mora said. "We didn't 
do anything against him that we wouldn't attempt against any quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
During the 44 minutes they held possession, about all the Saints did was run 
the ball, using Dalton Hilliard and rookie Paul Frazier, and convert little 
third-down plays with Hebert. 
</P>
<P>
Continually throwing short like Aikman, Hebert completed 16 of 19 -- seven 
times for first downs on third down -- for 153 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was that Hebert had a sound, experienced team with him. If 
Dallas rookies Johnson, Jones and Aikman are headed in that direction, they 
aren't there yet. They aren't even up with Archie Manning.

BERRY TAKES CHANCES, PATRIOTS TOP JETS, 27-24

<P>
A lot of people have been wondering what New England Coach Ray Berry is going 
to do with defensive stars Andre Tippett, Ronnie Lippett and Garin Veris 
sidelined for the season. 
</P>
<P>
If the Patriots' season-opening 27-24 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday 
is any indication, Berry is going to gamble. So far, his luck has been good. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots converted two key fourth-down plays in the first half to set up 
touchdowns, then parlayed a late missed fourth-quarter gamble into a 
game-winning, four-yard touchdown run by Reggie Dupard with 1:55 to play to win 
their sixth straight season opener. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game the Patriots also tried to give away. They scored the first three 
times they had the ball to build a 21-0 halftime lead, and then watched as the 
Jets scored 24 straight points to take a 24-21 lead with 7:28 to play on a 
49-yard touchdown pass from Ken O'Brien to JoJo Townsell. 
</P>
<P>
New England came back and drove from its 40 to the New York four with about 
three minutes to play. On fourth down, Berry could have elected to let Greg 
Davis attempt a chip shot field goal for a tie. Instead, he sent Dupard up the 
middle for no gain. 
</P>
<P>
Although the gamble didn't result in a first-down or touchdown, the Patriots 
were able to hold on defense. They got the ball back on the New York 38 with 
2:22 left following a 38-yard punt by Joe Prokop, who earlier had scored on a 
17-yard run on a fake field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Dupard was in the end zone. Tony Eason got the drive going 
with a 31-yard pass to Cedric Jones to the New York seven. Dupard got three on 
first down and then scored. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets never got farther than their own 44 on their final drive. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have learn that in this league you can't get away playing one 
half," O'Brien said. "You just can't leave 30 minutes on the sidelines."

KELLY'S RARE RUN LEADS BUFFALO STAMPEDE

<TEXT>
<P>
With the game on the line and the clock running out, Buffalo quarterback Jim 
Kelly decided it was time to score his first National Football League 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly ran two yards up the middle with no time left for the score, capping the 
Bills' rally from an 11-point deficit in the final three minutes to beat the 
Miami Dolphins, 27-24, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo trailed, 24-20, when Nate Odomes' second interception of Dan Marino set 
up the winning drive at the Buffalo 49 with 1:44 left. Kelly hit five of six 
passes before an incompletion and an offsides penalty against Miami put the 
ball at the two-yard line with two seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
From shotgun formation, Kelly took three steps back before heading for the end 
zone. He eluded end Jeff Cross and then dove across the goal line as Louis 
Oliver and David Frye hit him. 
</P>
<P>
"The play was a pass to the fullback coming out of the backfield," Kelly said. 
"I saw the linebacker go with him. I just took off. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping I'd make it because I knew if I didn't, I'd never hear the end of 
it for the rest of my career." 
</P>
<P>
It was Kelly's first rushing touchdown in his 45-game NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
On the Bills' previous possession, Kelly moved them 82 yards in 76 seconds for 
a touchdown on a 26-yard pass to Flip Johnson with 2:50 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone in this (interview) room could have said the Buffalo 
Bills were going to come back in the last few minutes," Kelly said. "The only 
person who knew that was me." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Buffalo's fifth straight over Miami, and the Dolphins have also 
lost 10 straight games to AFC East teams. The defeat ended their 13-game 
winning streak in home openers, the longest in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing this is about as tough as I can remember," Miami Coach Don Shula said. 
"I thought our guys really fought and scratched and deserved to win. . . . It's 
just a bitter disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's first touchdown came after Odomes stripped the ball from Miami's Troy 
Stradford, and linebacker Cornelius Bennett recovered at the Dolphin two-yard 
line. Larry Kinnebrew scored on the next play for a 10-10 tie in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Miami took a 17-10 lead in the third quarter when Jim Jensen blocked a punt by 
John Kidd and Marc Logan caught the ball just beyond the goal line. That was 
the Dolphins' first touchdown on a blocked punt since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Brown, a rookie free agent, caught an eight-yard touchdown pass from 
Marino to give Miami a 24-13 lead with 4:17 left. The catch was one of three 
Brown made on third down in the 73-yard scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt good about ourselves," Dolphin guard Roy Foster said. "We felt real 
confident. Then it was like this huge building fell on us." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins had a chance to build their lead but committed two turnovers 
inside the Buffalo 20 in the first 90 seconds of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Odomes intercepted a Marino pass at the 15. The Bills and Dolphins exchanged 
fumbles on the next two plays, with Buffalo's Derrick Burroughs recovering a 
bobble by Stradford at the 11. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Norwood kicked 37- and 34-yard field goals for Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver suffered a concussion on the final play. He was admitted to a hospital 
for observation.

BUCCANEERS FINISH PACKERS WITH INTERCEPTION, 23-21

<P>
Vinny Testaverde's passing put Tampa Bay in front, and Mark Robinson's late 
interception made sure the Buccaneers stayed there in Sunday's 23-21 victory 
over the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde led Tampa Bay to three second-quarter touchdowns and a 20-7 halftime 
lead. Then it was Robinson's turn. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson had two of Tampa Bay's three interceptions off Don Majkowski, 
including one on the eight-yard line with five minutes left that stopped the 
Packers' final drive. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the real big play, the key play of the game," Tampa Bay Coach Ray 
Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just in a zone coverage and he (Majkowski) overthrew it just a 
little," said Robinson, whose first interception led to the Buccaneers' 
go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde completed 22 of 27 passes for 205 yards and a touchdown. Majkowski 
completed 17 of 27 passes for 220 yards, but his overthrow on the potential 
go-ahead scoring drive was critical. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't make a very intelligent decision at the end and it probably cost us 
the game," Majkowski said. "I don't expect myself to do that. I'm very upset at 
the way it turned out." 
</P>
<P>
The Packers drove from their 30 to the Tampa Bay 16 before Robinson's 
interception. A personal foul penalty against Green Bay on the return gave the 
Buccaneers the ball on the 30, and they ran out the remaining 5:32. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers had scored on their first possession of the game, when Brent 
Fullwood ran it in from the three. But then the Buccaneers took control with 
three touchdowns, two coming after interceptions. The three drives consumed 
nearly 20 minutes in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay led, 20-7, at halftime before the Packers pulled within 23-21 with 
14:05 left as Carl Bland recovered teammate Perry Kemp's fumble in the end 
zone. Kemp fumbled after catching a 12-yard pass. Rookie Jeff Query's 45-yard 
reception set up the touchdown.

CARDINALS SHOOT DOWN LIONS ON DEL GRECO KICK

<P>
Detroit's new run-and-shoot offense was mostly run, thanks to an impressive 
debut by Barry Sanders, last season's Heisman Trophy winner. But it wasn't 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
Al Del Greco's 33-yard field goal with 13 seconds left Sunday gave the Phoenix 
Cardinals a 16-13 victory over the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, the former Oklahoma State star who held out until Thursday because of 
a salary dispute, rushed for 71 yards on nine carries after entering the game 
late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It just felt good to be out and running and playing football," he said. "I 
thought I ran pretty good, considering. I thought we were going to win the 
game. I guess it wasn't enough." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix quarterback Gary Hogeboom completed 21 of 35 passes for 264 yards, 
including a 15-yard strike to Roy Green for the Cardinals' only touchdown. 
Hogeboom hooked up with J.T. Smith 10 times for 121 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to go one on one with J.T. and Roy, sooner or later I'm going 
to get the ball in their hands," Hogeboom said. "We came out and did what we 
wanted to do. Everyone was running crisp routes and I felt pretty comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
The Silverdome crowd of 36,735 roared when Sanders ran onto the field with 5:34 
remaining in the third period and Lions at their own 44. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit gained 27 yards on the next play when Michael Zordich was called for 
pass interference on Jason Phillips. Sanders took over from there, carrying 
four consecutive times for 18, three, five, and three yards, breaking a tackle 
by Zordich on the final play for a touchdown that gave the Lions a 10-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders also had a 26-yard run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"This young man will restore the roar," Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes said. "He's 
everything we thought he was. Everyone knew he was going to carry the ball and 
he still did what he did. Hopefully, he'll make me a great coach. 
</P>
<P>
"This offense is a big-play offense, and it will get better with Barry." 
</P>
<P>
Del Greco's winning kick was his third field goal of the game. He also made 
them from 29 and 23 yards in the second quarter. Detroit's Eddie Murray kicked 
field goals of 30 and 23 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Lion quarterback Bob Gagliano, a Glendale product who got the start when Rodney 
Peete was injured during the preseason, completed only seven of 20 passes for 
116 yards. Phoenix out-gained Detroit in total yardage, 329-258.

ZIMMER'S LATEST MOVE HELPS CUBS WIN, 4-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago Cubs insist that Manager Don Zimmer's unorthodox moves have kept 
them loose and have helped make this an exciting season. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise move Zimmer made Sunday at Chicago before the Cubs played the St. 
Louis Cardinals may prove to be the key maneuver in the hot race in the 
National League East. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Maddux, the Cubs' most dependable pitcher, was scheduled to start the 
important game against the Cardinals in the battle for first place. Zimmer, in 
a last-minute decision, decided to give Maddux an extra day of rest and start 
left-hander Steve Wilson, who had pitched in relief Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson wasn't the winner in the 4-1 victory that increased the Cubs' lead over 
the Cardinals to 2 1/2 games, but he struck out 10 batters in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Smith's two-run home run in the sixth inning was the decisive blow that 
gave Scott Sanderson the win. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals are mostly contact hitters and went into the game with only 713 
strikeouts, fewest in the majors. But four Cub pitchers struck out 18 
Cardinals. Even hot-hitting Pedro Guerrero struck out three times. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs, meanwhile, had only three hits off rookie Ken Hill (7-12) in six 
innings, but Ryne Sandberg's single preceded Smith's ninth home run. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer said he decided to hold Maddux back a day for two reasons. First, the 
16-game winner had been hit hard in his previous start. And, he is usually more 
effective against the predominantly right-hand hitting Montreal Expos, who play 
in Chicago today. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the low point of the season Friday when we blew a 7-1 lead," Zimmer 
said. "You wonder if you'll ever win again when this happens. That's why the 
two victories were so sweet." 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog, although unaccustomed to watching his hitters 
swing and miss so often, was not downhearted. 
</P>
<P>
"We were 2 1/2 games out last Sunday and faced seven games with the three top 
contenders on the road," he said. "So, we're still 2 1/2 back." 
</P>

Wilson said he had no idea he would be the starter. "When I arrived at the 
park, pitching coach Dick Pole told me, Wilson said. "It almost knocked me 
over." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 5, Houston 3 -- It was a good day for division leaders, as all 
four in both leagues increased their leads. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants improved their lead in the West to six games at Houston and they did 
it by adding insult to injury. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Knepper, so ineffective most of the season that the Astros released him, 
gave up just five hits and two runs in six innings to get the victory that put 
a dent in the Astros' pennant hopes. With just 19 games remaining, the Astros 
must play 14 on the road where they are under .500. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no special delight in beating the Astros," Knepper said. "It was a 
business decision on their part. I really wasn't much help to them." 
</P>
<P>
The hit that helped beat the Astros was Pat Sheridan's three-run double in the 
first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, New York 1 -- When it's his turn to face the Mets, left-hander 
John Smiley's elbow suddenly stops hurting. 
</P>
<P>
After missing three turns with a sore elbow, Smiley held the Mets to four hits 
in 8 1/3 innings at New York and the Pirates dropped the Mets 4 1/2 games 
behind the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Smiley is 7-1 lifetime against the Mets, and the Pirates are 9-5 against them 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Redus homered off Sid Fernandez (11-4) in the seventh inning to put the 
Pirates ahead, and the Mets lost all hope in the eighth when center fielder 
Juan Samuel played Andy Van Slyke's long fly into a two-run triple. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why I've been so successful against the Mets," Smiley (11-7) 
said. "I was just glad to pitch without pain." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, Montreal 2 -- Rookie Pat Combs struck out eight Expos in seven 
innings at Montreal and won his first major league game. The Expos, who have 
lost eight of their last 13, are four games behind in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Roger McDowell gave up four hits in two innings of relief, but managed to get 
his 18th save. 
</P>
<P>
An angry Pascual Perez (8-13) blamed Manager Bob Rodgers for the loss because 
he ordered Von Hayes intentionally walked in the fifth and Tommy Barrett 
followed with the go-ahead single. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a stupid decision," Perez said. "I can belong to a team that doesn't 
hit, but let me make my own decisions on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 5, Atlanta 4 -- Pinch-hitter Ken Griffey singled in Paul O'Neill 
with one out in the ninth inning at Cincinnati to give the Reds the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey's hit gave the win to bullpen ace John Franco (4-7), who failed to hold 
a two-run lead in the top of the ninth. DAN HAFNER

MYSTERIOUS STRANGER SWIMS AWAY WITH LA JOLLA ROUGH WATER TITLE

He came and left quietly, but his performance in the water was anything but 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
Bari Weick, 28, of Mountain View, Calif., was in Arizona attending a retirement 
party for his father last week when he decided to enter Sunday's 59th La Jolla 
Rough Water Swim. 
</P>
<P>
"I had friends in San Diego who I wanted to see on my way home, and I decided 
to enter," said Weick, winner of the men's 25-29 masters one-mile swim at La 
Jolla Cove. Weick finished in 20:39 for the fastest masters (out of nine 
divisions) and overall time of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know who he was," said Del Mar's 29-year-old Alan Voisard, who 
finished second for the second consecutive year with a 21:08, 50 yards behind 
Weick. 
</P>
<P>
Weick, a distance swimmer for Stanford from 1979 to 1983, was a geographical 
enigma. He was listed as a Solana Beach resident (he's not) and some thought he 
was from Arizona, but three-quarters into the race, the pack of lead swimmers 
just knew he was in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
"At the second leg, he was only two or three body-lengths ahead of me," Voisard 
said, "but then he surged. He just took off." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Voisard nor the other 767 men in the masters divisions -- there were 
1,264 total swimmers -- had a chance to congratulate Weick. Thinking the race 
was Saturday, he had booked an afternoon flight to San Francisco. He didn't 
stay long to chat. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of fun," Weick said. "My stroke is suited to long distances, so I 
just stretched it out and took off." 
</P>
<P>
Water conditions were perfect -- smooth and warm -- and Weick's only complaint, 
echoed by other competitors, was the amount of kelp in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the worst thing and the best thing," he said. "The worse the conditions 
are, the better I like it because I can concentrate on my stroke." 
</P>
<P>
Beth Knight had to concentrate on just getting to the race. Knight swam the 
one-mile leg of a coed relay team that took second in the Bud Light Triathlon 
of San Diego Sunday morning in Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Knight, 30, of Del Mar, had time to go home and rest for 45 minutes before she 
entered the Pacific Ocean for the second time within four hours -- and won her 
sixth consecutive title. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel the effects," said Knight, who swam a 22:22 for a triple 
victory. Her finish won the 30-35 women's masters, the combined masters and the 
overall best time of the day for women.

MOLINA HOLDS OFF NEW WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SOLANA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the ever-increasing presence of younger and better-trained athletes, 
29-year-old Scott Molina, one of the grand-daddies of triathlon, made it known 
Sunday that he is not yet ready to yield. 
</P>
<P>
Molina -- who, as one of the sport's "Big Four," has been a dominant factor 
since 1982 -- won his fourth San Diego Bud Light Triathlon in 1 hour 49 minutes 
2 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
But while Molina proved that at least one of triathlon's pioneers can still be 
a force, the other story was the emergence of two newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
One, Andrew Carlson, made the San Diego Triathlon his first as a pro. And he 
didn't waste any time making his mark, surprising even the public address 
announcer by finishing second. As Carlson finished in 1:49:16, just 14 seconds 
behind Molina, the announcer roared, "I don't even know who this guy is, and I 
know all the top runners." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Carlson is a 22-year-old valet at the Ritz-Carlton in Laguna 
Beach, who is planning a move to Del Mar this week. 
</P>
<P>
In third (1:49:46) was Miles Stewart of Surfers Paradise, Australia. At 18, he 
figures to be a factor for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-race favorite and defending champion Mike Pigg decided at the last minute 
to pull out in an effort to prepare for the Ironman in October. 
</P>
<P>
Another non-factor was Scott Tinley, a Del Mar resident and two-time champion. 
Tinley entered, but dropped back soon after the start of the bike phase. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite in the women's race also failed to show; the absence of Paula 
Newby-Fraser went unexplained. Sylviane Puntous ran away for a victory in 
2:02:10. Colleen Cannon was 30 seconds behind in second and Patricia Puntous, 
Sylviane's identical twin, was third in 2:04:00. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time this year that Sylviane and Cannon have finished one-two 
in a United States Triathlon Series race. 
</P>
<P>
While the top three women finishers were laughing and talking about old times 
afterward, the top three men were just trying to get to know one another. 
</P>
<P>
That process actually started earlier, at least for Molina and Carlson, toward 
the end of the finishing 10-kilometer run. 
</P>
<P>
At the foot of the last hill, Molina decided to test his surprise opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know how well Andrew could run," said Molina, of Boulder, Colo. "So I 
decided to go all out and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
What Molina found was simply that he had more left as he opened a small lead. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was anything but old hat to Molina, a four-time winner of the USTS 
National Championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just so hard to win because there are so many good guys now," Molina 
said. "Winning means a lot more now, I think." 
</P>
<P>
The leader after the 1.5-kilometer ocean swim was Garrett McCarthy, and the 
leader after the 40-kilometer bike ride was Encinitas' Mark Montgomery. Neither 
finished in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson came out of the water in second at 18:35 to McCarthy's 18:32. Stewart 
and Molina were right behind Carlson at 18:37 and 18:38. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was considered the best cycler and was expected to pull away in that 
phase. But he instead found himself among a pack of eight jousting for the lead 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
When the riders reached the transition area, Stewart was fourth, seven seconds 
ahead of Molina and 11 ahead of Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
So it came down to the run. 
</P>
<P>
"(Midway through), Andrew looked pretty confident and I knew Miles was right 
behind, so it was going to go down to the end," Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
It went down, in fact, to that last hill, where Molina's test proved too much 
for the rookie.

JACK SMITH: 'TWAS A LOWLY JEEP THAT WON WORLD WAR II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My indefatigable correspondent Duke Russell has sent me a clipping from the New 
York Times reporting that the Army is going to replace the Jeep with something 
called the Hummer. 
</P>
<P>
This should twang the strings of nostalgia for every man and woman who served 
in uniform in World War II. The Jeep was ubiquitous. It was the most useful and 
beloved of military vehicles. It was more crucial, in the long run, than mobile 
guns, tanks or even, I suspect, the battleship. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure the Jeep was involved in many actual combat situations, and I have no 
doubt that it served with honor. But to most GIs it will be remembered with 
affection as the vehicle of leisure, of liberty, of non-military but 
life-enhancing missions. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody who has ever seen a war movie is familiar with the Jeep, that sturdy 
little boxlike vehicle with two seats front and back, no top and a snub nose. 
It is the vehicle U.S. generals are shown riding in when they visit the field. 
(German generals ride in Mercedes phaetons.) 
</P>
<P>
It was the vehicle in which John Hodiak, as a major, entered the war-stricken 
Italian village of Adano, in "A Bell for Adano," and the vehicle in which, 
having angered higher-ups, he left. 
</P>
<P>
In the TV series "MASH," Hawkeye and Hotlips had their only romantic clinch 
when they were out riding in a Jeep and were forced to take cover from enemy 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
As a mere noncom in the Marine Corps, I did not often have access to a Jeep. 
But once on Maui, when I was doing public relations for the Fourth Division, I 
was assigned a Jeep and a photographer and told to find a model young Marine 
and a pretty girl from one of the nearby towns and show them romancing at 
Maui's picture places. 
</P>
<P>
I found the Marine, and I found the girl in Wailuku, and we drove them in our 
Jeep from the Fourth Division camp, in the valley below Haleakala, to Hana, 
which was said to have the island's most beautiful beach. There was then no 
real road -- only a roadbed that had been dynamited out. It was full of holes 
and boulders. It was a bone-jarring trip. The model Marine and I rode in back, 
which bounced harder. We posed the Marine and the girl on the pristine beach -- 
there was nothing there then but an agricultural station -- and then drove 
back. I was so shaken up by the ride that I had to spend three days in sick 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
On about D-plus-5 on Iwo Jima I was holed up in a wrecked Japanese concrete 
bunker when an enlisted man came by in a Jeep. He was lost. I persuaded him to 
drive me over the battlefield to Fifth Division headquarters, at the foot of 
Mt. Suribachi, on the promise that I could get some booze there. I was a friend 
of the Fifth's medical officer, and I knew that he would have an oversupply of 
medicinal brandy, if I could find him. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth Division headquarters was merely a number of shell holes covered by 
tarpaulins. I asked from one to the next until I found my friend. He was 
sitting alone in his hole, surrounded by medical supplies. He appeared to be in 
shock, but he revived and greeted me warmly. I explained my mission and he gave 
me an armful of brandy in two-ounce bottles. The driver was well rewarded for 
driving me, and that night I shared the rest with my companions in the bunker. 
</P>
<P>
After the war I was stationed for a while in Pearl Harbor, writing stories 
about Marines who had been imprisoned throughout the war by the Japanese. I 
wanted to go home. I had a son I hadn't seen. I kept bugging the colonel. He 
finally told me, "I want to go home, too, Smith." 
</P>
<P>
"But you have a Jeep, colonel," I told him. "And a girlfriend," I added 
maliciously. Two weeks later I was on a midget aircraft carrier, headed toward 
San Diego and home. 
</P>
<P>
The Army says the Hummer is "substantially larger and far more versatile than 
the Jeep," and "the troops love them." 
</P>
<P>
"I weepeth," Duke says, "but that's good enough for me. Survival is the name of 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well, we still have those old movies.

Horror film villains Freddy Krueger and Jason are better known to children than 
Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr., according to a 
survey conducted by the Champaign, Ill.-based National Coalition on Television 
Violence. Jason, the hockey-masked killer in the "Friday the 13th" movies, was 
correctly identified by 72% of the 100 10-to-13-year-olds surveyed. Krueger, 
the razor-gloved killer from the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series, was 
identified by 66%. King and Washington were each below the 60% mark, while 
Lincoln was only identified by 36%. The best-known historical or political 
figure in the survey was Vice President Dan Quayle, who was correctly 
identified by 62% of the students. (President Bush was not included on the 
survey.) Shauna Snow and ALEENE MacMINN

Gordon Davidson, Ahmanson Theatre producing director, has asked Ahmanson 
subscribers to give him a month to come up with a replacement in the Ahmanson 
season for "Jerome Robbins' Broadway." Last week, the opening of the musical's 
Los Angeles engagement was abruptly postponed from next April to May, 1991 -- a 
move which caught Davidson by surprise, he said. If Davidson can't find a show 
"of sufficient quality and stature" to match "Broadway" within the next month, 
he said, he'll refund the price of the "Broadway" tickets to his subscribers. 
If he does find a replacement, individual subscribers who don't want to see it 
will also be given refunds. Ahmanson subscribers had created a $2.5-million 
advance sale for "Broadway," said Davidson. Meanwhile, he said the owners of 
the Shubert Theatre, where "Broadway" will eventually be presented, don't have 
an understudy show waiting in the wings. Shauna Snow and ALEENE MacMINN

One of the Soviet Union's largest film studios, Lenefilm Studios of Leningrad, 
will be represented in the United States by Los Angeles-based NEO International 
Ventures Inc., an agreement that will make the arrangement of film and TV 
location shoots in the Soviet Union "much easier," according to NEO President 
Nick Olaerts. According to Lenefilm president Alexander Golutva, "This 
agreement opens up unlimited opportunities for both countries to begin cultural 
exchanges on an entertainment level." Golutva was part of a delegation of four 
Russian film makers that spent the past two weeks in Los Angeles negotiating 
the contract with NEO. Shauna Snow and ALEENE MacMINN

The director of the smash-hit film "Batman" criticized censors who have stopped 
children in Europe from seeing their hero. Tim Burton, speaking Sunday to 
reporters in France at the Deauville festival of American films, rejected 
criticism that violent and sadistic scenes made his film unfit for children. "I 
think it is for everyone," said Burton. "I think it's much more subversive to 
tell (children) that something is bad. . . . They're going to want to see it 
anyway." Britain and Belgium have barred children (under 12 and 16, 
respectively) from seeing the film, rated PG-13 in the United States (parents 
strongly cautioned about children under 13 seeing the film). French censors 
will rule today whether to impose an age restriction. Much of Warner Bros.' 
massive marketing campaign for its film has been aimed at children. Shauna Snow

The Oregon Symphony Assn. has accepted the resignation of managing director 
Carlos Wilson, more than three weeks after he ordered orchestra members locked 
out in a labor dispute over working conditions. "We now believe it is in the 
best long-term artistic and financial interests of this organization to accept 
Mr. Wilson's resignation," said J. Clayton Hering, symphony association 
president. Hering denied the symphony board was caving in to a union demand 
that Wilson be replaced, and said the resignation would not become effective 
until Dec. 1. Wilson would continue to negotiate with the musicians' union in 
hopes of ending a labor lockout in time for the symphony's opening concert

IT IS BETTER, BUT FLUFF, PUFF STILL PLAGUE TELEVISION NEWS

KGTV(Channel 10) anchor/commentator Michael Tuck said in a recent radio 
interview that "television news is better now than it was five years a go." 
</P>
<P>
This is some sort of ritualistic chant practiced by just about everybody 
employed in the television news industry. Question any aspect of TV news1 and 
they get this glazed look on their face, usually followed by, "Well that may be 
true, but it is better now than it was five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Or they start talking about Edward R. Murrow. Either way, television news 
professionals tend to defend the present by comparing it to the past. The 
constant comparisons to the past could lead some to believe that TV news had 
been pretty lousy. Especially since five years ago they said TV news was better 
than five years before that. In fact, they've been fondly reflecting on the 
leaps and bounds made by TV news ever since someone first said, "Maybe it would 
be a good idea to show some pictures while we read the news." 
</P>
<P>
Local TV news people say the resources at their disposal are far greater than 
ever before. Now that news is a moneymaker for stations, they have more staff, 
more equipment and more technical versatility than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, ask them why they don't do a better job of covering the day-to-day 
news, and they quickly point out that they don't have the resources. Then they 
get that glazed look. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the thoughts of many in the industry, Tuck said that competition has 
improved television news, that the overall quality of journalism is far better 
than in the Happy Talk Era of a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He also said television news is "more cynical and penetrating of what public 
officials are doing," which, except for his aggressive "Perspective" pieces, 
could be called laughable. A recent Tribune analysis of local TV news showed 
that KFMB-TV (Channel 8), for example, devoted twice as much time to sports as 
to government and education stories, and twice as much time to weather as 
national news. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond covering every obligatory press conference and staged-for-television 
photo opportunity, political coverage by television news is rarely more 
sophisticated than a few talking-head interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of just being reactive and covering (stories) on the surface, we're 
looking at root causes more," Tuck said. 
</P>
<P>
That's probably true. They are far more willing to go in-depth on some 
subjects. Channel 10 devotes quite a bit of time to its annual swimsuit 
feature. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Channel 10 was one of many stations to focus on drug issues, which 
gave the station the opportunity to show footage over and over again of 
narcotics officers making a bust. Or maybe that was "Cops" or "Geraldo." It's 
becoming harder to tell the difference these days. 
</P>
<P>
Witness the antics of Channel 39's Paul Bloom, who gleefully reenacts crime 
scenes, pointing to blood stains and pantomiming the use of guns for emphasis. 
Other than coming across as a shill for the Police Department, Bloom's style of 
reporting, and the rapidly growing group of television reporters doing similar 
reports, aims to strike emotional chords with the audience, more than simply 
telling the story. 
</P>
<P>
That's a relatively new development in the industry. Whether it is better or 
not is a reasonable topic of debate. 
</P>
<P>
Other elements of TV news remain relatively unchanged. At least 90% of the 
stories covered by television are generated from press releases or newspaper 
stories. Far too often they simply pick up stories without bothering to check 
facts. It's the same type of rip-and-read approach used by old radio news 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Television news undoubtedly is better in its ability to cover events live, to 
instantaneously be at the scene of a breaking news story. On the other hand, 
the preponderance of unnecessary stilted live reports is a truly annoying part 
of modern television news. Was it really necessary for KNSD-TV (Channel 39) to 
have a reporter live at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, even though it was 
empty, to babble about Pete Rose? 
</P>
<P>
Tuck said television news is better because it does a better job of covering 
the stories that are important to people, such as environment and health 
issues. Just last week, Channel 10 had "focus groups," or average citizens, 
watching its newscasts to tell the station what is important, what they like 
and don't like about Channel 10 news. 
</P>
<P>
Input from such groups, aided by surveys and the all-important, God-like 
barometer of TV news -- ratings -- shape TV news, even more so than five years 
ago. The polling methods are more sophisticated now, and therein lies the 
well-documented basic flaw of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Asking people what they want to see on TV is sort of like asking children what 
they want for dinner. They may not watch what they say they want to see, and 
they're rarely going to ask for what's good for them. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a truckload of sensational yet superficial stories, an emphasis 
on warm puppy features instead of the real factors that control people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, in some ways, television news is better than five years ago. And 
microwave popcorn is better, in some ways, than conventional popcorn. But it's 
still 90% fluff. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Charles Hohm, chairman of the sociology department at San Diego State 
University, was "incensed at the sloppy reporting" of the arrest of Jack D. 
Mooers, an SDSU associate professor. 
</P>
<P>
When Mooers was picked up for having a few hundred marijuana plants on his 
property, he reportedly told police he worked for SDSU's sociology department. 
In fact, Mooers worked in the school of teacher education, which was reported 
by news outlets that bothered to call the university. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hohm's research, the local newspapers and Channel 39 checked with 
the school, but Channels 8 and 10 simply referred to him as a professor of 
sociology, not the type of association the sociology department craves. 
</P>
<P>
When he tried to get a correction, Hohm found the TV stations had "no remorse, 
a real cavalier attitude" toward the mistake, which Hohm feels tarnished his 
department. 
</P>
<P>
At least Hohm can take solace in knowing TV news is better now than it was five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
KSDO-FM (102.9) has hired longtime KGB-FM (101.5) deejay John Leslie to work 
afternoons, the first local hiring by the station, which switched to a classic 
rock format a week ago. The station has picked up Phil Hendrie, most recently 
of KLSX in Los Angeles, to do morning drive, at least temporarily. More hirings 
are expected this week. . . . Fired KKLQ (Q106) morning deejay Jack Murphy will 
be on KVSD-AM's (1000) "Night Talk" talk show at 8:30 tonight to share his 
views on life and his ex-employer.

Walt Disney Co. has changed its mind and decided to allow a giant statue of 
Winnie the Pooh to be built in the Canadian town near where the famous little 
bear was born. Disney -- which holds copyright to all reproductions of Winnie 
the Pooh -- turned down a request made earlier this year by the town of White 
River, Ontario, saying it had other "contractual commitments" for Pooh. Tom 
Bagdon, president of the White River Chamber of Commerce, thinks adverse 
publicity may have caused the Disney Co. to relent. "When we were refused and 
that went public they were swamped with calls," Bagdon said. "Once they 
verified the claim that Winnie the Pooh was a real bear and our story was 
accurate, their lawyers said we could go ahead and put up our statue." 
According to Bagdon, Pooh, the bear on whom British writer A.A. Milne based his 
children's stories, was born near White River in 1914. The cub was later taken 
to Europe and left at the London Zoo where Milne and his son, Christopher 
Robin, spotted the gentle American black bear. Shauna Snow and ALEENE MacMINN

DALLAS CONCERT HALL OPENS, DAY LATE AND DOLLAR SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM ALBRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DALLAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Its 11-year gestation and 4-year construction spanned the terms of 4 mayors, 3 
city managers and 7 city councils. Its initial price tag of $49.5 million was 
perhaps quadrupled by delays, conflicts, changes and cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday night the Dallas Symphony's Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center 
opened with all the pomp and panoply demanded by high society in Big D. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by famed architect I.M. Pei and acoustician Russell Johnson, the 
building is called the Meyerson Center because Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot 
said it would be. His $10-million gift required a commemoration to the chairman 
of the building committee and former president of Perot's Electronic Data 
Systems. (Perot also was demanding his money back if the hall weren't 
world-class enough!) 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Symphony hails it as a long-needed improvement over its previous 
performing home, but a former city councilman calls it "just a continuation of 
Dallas trying to buy some respectability." 
</P>
<P>
High point of a fortnight of celebration, Friday's opening concert featured 
Mahler's Second Symphony and Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto with Texas' 
favorite semiretired native son, Van Cliburn. 
</P>
<P>
The sound produced by the Dallas Symphony under Eduardo Mata, its music 
director since 1977, was bright but not strident, warm if not mellow. A bit 
harsh at high volume, the violins were silken in quiet passages. The lower 
strings boasted assertive resonance. The brasses blared keenly but not 
fiercely, and they didn't swamp the woodwinds. 
</P>
<P>
Cliburn's poetic but sometimes startlingly inaccurate playing projected 
forcefully, and the hall proved very flattering to voices in the Mahler Second. 
The Dallas Symphony Chorus sang with both power and textural clarity, and even 
the quietest tones produced by contralto Maureen Forrester and soprano Sylvia 
McNair sailed out into the auditorium with arresting ease and presence. 
</P>
<P>
The hall is located on 260,000 square feet of land in the Arts District, 60 
downtown acres that also contain the Dallas Museum of Art and a Dallas Theater 
Center satellite space. The Meyerson Center is a rectangle -- the Eugene 
McDermott Concert Hall -- sitting at an angle inside a square girdled by 
segments of a circle. Three of the artificially aged limestone walls boast 
curved roof-line windows called "lenses" but nicknamed "eyebrows." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeping around the building is the "conoid," a dramatic arc of glass that 
covers the restaurant space on the west side and has 211 computer-designed 
panes, no two of which are the same size. Venetian blindlike sunscreens made of 
one-inch aluminum tubing dim the daytime glare but still allow nighttime 
concertgoers to gaze out at the Dallas skyline. The high-ceilinged lobby is 
spacious and pleasant. But thanks to the Italian marble walls and floors, it's 
also as noisy as a tiled locker room. 
</P>
<P>
The McDermott Concert Hall seats only 2,065. But 200 or more of those seats, 
perched behind the orchestra, are designed for use by choristers and can't be 
sold when the program requires a choir. This makes the McDermott an unusually 
small American auditorium. Amsterdam's Concertgebouw and Vienna's 
Musikvereinssaal, the halls most admired by the team that selected Pei and 
Johnson, contain fewer than 1,700 seats, but Carnegie Hall holds 2,727 and 
Boston's Symphony Hall 2,631. 
</P>
<P>
The seats themselves are rust-colored (the socialite next to me thought in a 
certain light they looked mauve). A one-time fee of $10,000 and a ticket to 
each concert gets you a seat in one of the 18 boxes. Friday night, a bejeweled 
box holder, obviously new to such elite concert accommodations, was overheard 
asking an usher where her booth was. 
</P>
<P>
Shoebox-shaped, 85 feet high and nicely intimate, the auditorium is dressy, 
appointed with brass railings, marble banisters and onyx sconces. It is also 
"live," as you might expect given the lack of carpet on the terrazzo floors. 
But many items were built in to warm and "tune" the hall. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic and controversial of these is the 42-ton, four-part, steel 
and wood acoustic canopy that hovers over the stage and several rows of seats. 
Not operable until January 1993, when the 4,463-pipe Fisk organ will also be 
dedicated, it can be hydraulically raised, lowered or tilted, affecting how 
sound is projected into the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Also included to enhance the acoustics are cherry wood panels on the 
concrete-block walls, 62 adjustable acoustical curtains, an L-shaped hollow 
space under the stage to boost the resonance of the cellos and double basses, 
and 72 concrete doors. 
</P>
<P>
These doors, some of them weighing 2.5 tons each, control the flow of sound in 
and out of the 30-foot-deep reverberation chamber that extends around the top 
level of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Tired of the way the size (3,420 seats) and fan-shape of its previous home, the 
Fair Park Music Hall, dulled its sound, the Dallas Symphony decided to build 
itself a new home way back in 1978. A bond election that year failed, but a 
1982 vote was "aye" and ground was broken in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Pei, 72, is famous for the John F. Kennedy Library in Cambridge, Mass., the 
East Wing of the National Gallery in Washington and the remodeling of the 
Louvre in Paris. He is infamous in Dallas for being six years late and $14 
million over budget when building City Hall in the 1960s. Nonetheless, he was 
hired to design his first-ever concert hall and Russell Johnson was named the 
acoustician. They, and their consultants, received fees of $9.9 million and 
$1.5 million, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the hall kept rising as Texas' oil-driven economy kept sinking. 
The cost of construction ultimately hit $81.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But the tariff swells to $106.4 million -- shared $56.2 million to $50.2 
million by the city and the Dallas Symphony Assn. -- when you add the land, the 
organ, the underground garage, an adjacent park, a commemorative entrance arch 
and sculpture (Eduardo Chillida's "De Musica") and the overtime costs to finish 
the acoustic canopy. 
</P>
<P>
Factor in financing charges and a parking garage for concert-goers and the tab 
balloons to just under $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
Until August, 1993, when the Symphony Assn.'s final payments are due, Big D 
will stand for Big Debt.

LOONY FOLK HISTORY IN 'GIMLI' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Tales From the Gimli Hospital" (a new Friday-midnight movie at the Nuart) is 
such an oddball little show -- a Canadian regional production shot for $22,000 
and based, tongue-in-cheek, on the folk history of a small Icelandic fishing 
community in Manitoba -- that some audiences may get weirded out during the 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
It's a dry, fluky comedy about the perils of immigrant communities and bad 
health facilities -- shot in a style that's a clever pastiche of early '30s 
experimental talkies. The imagery is purposely deranged and the movie pumps it 
out in slow, deliberate rhythms that become daffy and excruciating. 
</P>
<P>
Sultry vamp nurses, made up like Valley Girl versions of Louise Brooks, try to 
heal victims of a mysterious epidemic by rubbing their sores with dead sea 
gulls. Three angelic little girls vanish hand-in-hand in a sylvan wood and 
later float back down a river in individual coffins. 
</P>
<P>
The characters have names like Einar the Lonely, Elfa Egilsdottir, Lord 
Dufferin and the Fish Princess. Einar, the crazed hero, (Kyle McCulloch) 
pomades his hair with fish grease squeezed right from the fish, violates a 
corpse on an Indian burial platform and indulges in a bout of nocturnal, 
buttock-grabbing wrestling while bagpipes wail. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the whole dolorous history is recounted by an ample nurse, Amma 
(Margaret-Anne McCleod) to two children on a death watch in their mothers' 
contemporary Gimli hospital room; here, "contemporary" means the early '30s. 
</P>
<P>
There's a loony concentration to "Gimli" (Times-rated: Mature, for style, theme 
and sexuality). Much of it revolves around the two epidemic victims, Einar and 
Gunnar (Michael Gottli), as they lie in the filthy, turn-of-the century Gimli 
Hospital -- a makeshift facility in a hay-strewn barn -- staring at each other 
with increasing hostility from their separate beds. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg writer-director-editor-photographer, Guy Maddin -- whose grandmother 
was an Icelandic immigrant -- has quite an imagination and a talent for 
pastiche. Maddin tries to capture the look and feel of the early low-budget 
experimental talkies or late silents, and he's amazingly good at it.

'FAFFNER HALL' OPENS WITH MUPPETS AND FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oh, those ubiquitous Muppets. The dynasty that Jim Henson hath wrought takes up 
the cause of music appreciation in "The Ghost of Faffner Hall," an ambitious 
new children's series that begins at 8:30 tonight on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
It all happens in a Gothic mansion called Faffner Hall, an institution 
dedicated to music. Residents include the Hall's founder, Fughetta Faffner, a 
ghost who loves music (even if it does tend to "solidify her ectoplasm"); the 
fat, jolly Wild Impressario, who plans the Hall's musical events, and hipsters 
Rif and Mimi. 
</P>
<P>
There are assorted penguins, fish, otherworldly monsters and the villain of the 
piece, music hater Farkus Faffner. 
</P>
<P>
Top-drawer, winsome guest stars are worked into each plot. Tonight's episode, 
"Your Body Is an Instrument," features Gary Karr, who says his double bass is 
his voice and "my voice is me"; Grammy winner Bobby McFerrin, whose body is an 
entire orchestra; and Swedish trumpeter Hakan Hardenberger playing an achingly 
beautiful solo. (The show's music is original.) 
</P>
<P>
In next week's episode, Nigel Kennedy, with his punk-rock look and young boy 
charm, shows the extraordinary range of a violin, while singer-songwriter Joni 
Mitchell is Wild Impressario's love interest. 
</P>
<P>
Created by producer Jocelyn Stevenson and based on a curriculum developed by 
two University of York professors, John Paynter and R. Murray Schafer, the 
13-part series is designed to inspire creative listening and show that all 
sounds can be musical. 
</P>
<P>
Does it all work? Surprisingly, no. It's watchable, the Muppet creations are as 
wild and wonderful as expected and the guest stars even more so -- they all but 
steal the show. (Future guests include Ry Cooder, Dizzy Gillespie and Ladysmith 
Black Mombazo.) 
</P>
<P>
But entertainment and education here are a lumpy mix; the pot needs more 
stirring. LYNNE HEFFLEY

WILLIAMS LEADS POPS CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You know summer's really over when there are empty boxes for a weekend pops 
concert at Hollywood Bowl. John Williams conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
Friday evening for an audience unusually thin down front, characteristically 
full and vociferous higher up. 
</P>
<P>
Williams had been here just a month before, with the Boston Pops Esplanade 
Orchestra. He even returned with some of the same pieces, at least among his 
own compositions. Up for encore were music from "The Accidental Tourist" and 
"E.T.," and the March from "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade." 
</P>
<P>
Williams made his mark with those pieces, and a lusty Hoe-Down from Copland's 
"Rodeo." His "Liberty Fanfare" and "Cowboys Overture" proved less compelling, 
and the rest of the program -- medley arrangements from "Porgy and Bess," 
"Fiddler on the Roof" and musicals choreographed by Jerome Robbins, and William 
Schuman's placid "Chester" arrangement -- had only intermittent moments of high 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra played reasonably well for Williams, particularly the abundantly 
exercised brass. Concertmaster Alexander Treger handled the extrovert 
mini-concerto in the "Fiddler" potpourri with over-amplified elan. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 13,956 fans stayed to cheer Williams and the Philharmonic on 
through four encores, and a series of bows that ended only when the conductor 
shooed the orchestra off the stage. JOHN HENKEN

JASPER JOHNS -- THE MAN AND HIS ART ON 'MASTERS'

<TEXT>
<P>
Jasper Johns had his first show at the Leo Castelli Gallery, a Manhattan 
showcase most artists would kill for, and he immediately sold three paintings 
to the Museum of Modern Art. It was an auspicious beginning for an artist often 
said to be the best in the country and who commands higher auction prices than 
any other living artist. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at Johns' career as pretty much a downhill slide from a not very high 
point to begin with," critic Hilton Kramer says, but no one shares his view in 
"Jasper Johns: Ideas in Paint," airing on "American Masters" at 9 tonight on 
Channels 28 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
Artists Frank Stella and Richard Serra, critics Barbara Rose and Paul Richard, 
dealer Castelli, choreographer Merce Cunningham and experimental musician John 
Cage are full of praise as they explain that Johns' work is, well, you know, 
unexplainable. 
</P>
<P>
This leisurely hourlong film, produced and directed by Rick Tejada-Flores, 
takes time for Cage's music, Cunningham's dance, a sequence on printmaking and 
the seldom-heard-from artist's long pauses. Collage-like in structure, "Ideas 
in Paint" proceeds chronologically but also doubles back on itself, picking up 
snippets from commentators and returning to Christie's Nov. 9, 1988, auction, 
where Johns' "White Flag" set a record of $7 million -- topped the following 
night by Sotheby's $17-million sale of "False Start." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I fully understand the process," Johns says. "When it begins, 
you're pleased that you can make something and sell it. It allows you to devote 
yourself to the work you want to do. As it expands and the value increases, you 
see that society takes over in the value and the meaning of the work." 
</P>
<P>
With Johns, the meaning is the tricky part. What to make of his targets, flags, 
maps and ale cans? The reticent artist offers some insights: His work reflects 
the fragmentation of life, neutral subject matter allows him to concentrate on 
painting, he doesn't want his work to expose his feelings, he prefers real 
things to illusions. 
</P>
<P>
If he appears uncomfortable, looking rather like a furtive rabbit, it's 
probably because he wants to get on with his job. If the film is disjointed, it 
nonetheless reflects the complex texture of Johns' inscrutable art. SUZANNE

A NEW MAN FOR A NEW ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A somewhat obscure California bureaucrat suddenly has an opportunity to direct 
national water policy in a bold new direction of sound resource management and 
environmental protection. He is 44-year-old Dennis Underwood, a civil engineer 
who has spent the past 11 years on the staff of the Colorado River Board of 
California, based in downtown Los Angeles. Underwood has been chosen by 
President Bush to be chief of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the agency that 
once ruled western water resources with virtually an iron fist as an act of 
beneficence for powerful senators and congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
Going back to 1902, the bureau had one basic goal: to build mighty dams and to 
make the western desert and brushlands bloom with the magic of irrigation water 
sold cheap to the farmers who repeatedly reelected the congressional water 
giants like California's Bernie Sisk and Colorado's Wayne Aspinall. But times 
have changed. The Sisks and Aspinalls are gone from Congress. All the easy dams 
have been built. The new cities of the West are competing for the water. A 
strong environmental ethic has entered the water debate. The political trend is 
running against any more costly, subsidized irrigation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing this, federal officials formally changed the mission of the Bureau of 
Reclamation to one of better management of water resources. But the 
4,000-person agency has drifted the past half dozen years under weak leadership 
and with no apparent interest at the White House or Interior Department in the 
development of a coherent national water policy. Now is the time to write one. 
</P>
<P>
Is Dennis Underwood the man to direct such a conversion? Perhaps. Those who 
know him credit Underwood with being pleasant, bright and knowledgeable on the 
issues. Underwood has worked with water officials throughout the Colorado River 
Basin and with the federal reclamation workers who oversee the Colorado's 
operations. But there is some question as to whether he has the political 
skills and stomach for battling an entrenched reclamation bureaucracy that has 
been shorn of its glamorous dam-building tradition and uprooted from Washington 
to Denver in recent years. And there is some question whether Underwood will 
have the support or mandate for doing so from the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But Underwood and the Administration now have an unsurpassed opportunity for 
turning the dispirited bureau into a model of modern water management. The 
bureau should be given responsibility for developing ground-water management 
programs to safeguard aquifers that serve both cities and farms. The bureau 
should work to reverse some of the damage done over the years by reclamation 
projects, such as contamination caused by irrigation drainage problems 
throughout the West. The bureau can play an important role in easing the 
inevitable transition of water supplies from farms to the cities in some areas, 
and in developing water conservation programs. 
</P>
<P>
Should Underwood and his superiors choose to take such a leadership course, 
they are certain to have strong support in Congress from the new water leaders 
like Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) and Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.). Should 
they fail to rid themselves of the old irrigation-project mentality, they will 
not find much sympathy. Even California's San Joaquin Valley no longer has a 
congressional champion who can be counted on to pass wanted legislation or kill 
unfavorable regulations with a whisper to a colleague or a phone call to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
The new water age is here. The Bush Administration must decide now whether it 
will seize a leadership role, or be pulled along by the flow.

GLEMP'S REMARKS ON AUSCHWITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a Jew. My parents died at Auschwitz. The remainder of the two sides of 
both large families died there too. They weren't special, just your usual 
middle-class Jews. A few among millions. But it is our duty to remember their 
suffering; it was the most important thing they ever did. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the risks and sacrifices of certain Catholics who took the message of 
Jesus personally, I remain the one survivor of this vast clan. Catholics -- 
laypersons, priests, nuns -- saved the lives of many Jews. Thereby risking 
their own imprisonment and death. Many suffered such a fate. It is just as 
necessary to remember them. 
</P>
<P>
What can be wrong about the presence of the silent nuns at Auschwitz? The 
Jewish presence is represented by our dead; that of the Catholics by the 
praying living who constantly praise God, which can only help to heal this 
Jewish wound. 
</P>
<P>
We both worship the same God. Divisions are created by human ignorance, but God 
loves us all equally. 
</P>
<P>
The objections of some Jews to the presence of the nuns at Auschwitz are but 
one more manifestation of the human capacity for divisiveness and hatred. 
</P>
<P>
Let us try to honor those who suffered and sacrificed by loving one another 
rather than by our pettiness.

A WHALE'S DEATH

I was shocked and horrified when I read the news accounts about the two captive 
killer whales (Kandu and Corky) who were forced to compete against each other 
in the San Diego Sea World park in order to titillate the watching audiences. I 
realize that Kandu broke her jaw after charging into the other whale -- but Sea 
World is at fault for creating such a stressful environment in the first place.

DOING HOMEWORK CLOSER TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until last week, deciding how to invest pension funds did not seem particularly 
exotic duty. But then came Times writer Virginia Ellis' account of the 
beneficence of an organization called the Institute of Fiduciary Education. 
</P>
<P>
The institute is financed by group of international money managers, all 
interested in getting their hooks into some of the $80 billion held by two 
public pension funds in California, the Public Employees Retirement System and 
the Teachers Retirement System. Over the past four years, the students of the 
fiduciary institute have included 16 members of the governing boards of those 
pension funds. Their education has consisted of flying overseas, putting up at 
world-class hotels, dining sumptuously and attending seminars on how easy and 
wonderful it is to invest abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Said Keith Chun, a member of the board of the teachers' system, of one such 
trip to Tokyo: "That one week has got to be my example of how the rich and 
famous live." 
</P>
<P>
The money managers certainly knew what they were about. For an expenditure that 
the board members themselves estimated at a grand total for all 16 trips of 
less than $1 million, tops, the fiduciary institute has gotten commitments of 
$9 billion in foreign investments from the public employees' fund alone. The 
teachers' system is still examining what its board learned at its seminars 
hither and yon. 
</P>
<P>
The splendor of the learning environment of these fledgling foreign investors 
set us to wondering what the portfolios of the two pension funds would look 
like if the board, like its pensioners, had been asked to pay its own way to 
Paris or Tokyo or wherever. Would the commitment to investing abroad be any 
different had the board members been handed a stack of books with all of the 
relevant statistics and asked to spend a week of their next vacation plodding 
through them? 
</P>
<P>
The more we pondered those questions, the more it seemed to us that the way to 
get the answers would be to change the rules so that the board members from now 
on would learn about investing abroad the hard way: At a seminar or over a desk 
somewhere closer to home. The teachers and other public employees who will 
depend on their pensions funds when they retire come by their contributions by 
working for them. The board members should come by their knowledge about 
investing those contributions the same way -- not by hoping to chance on a 
morsel of wisdom along with their fine wine and rare steak.

GLEMP'S REMARKS ON AUSCHWITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial certainly is a new low. How dare you put the Polish cardinal down 
for speaking the truth! How dare the Jews try to tell the Catholic Church or 
Poland where it can or cannot place a convent. A convent which houses nuns 
praying for, among others, dead Jews. What harm is the convent doing? What evil 
thing? In the first place, the convent is on the edge of Auschwitz, not smack 
dab in the heart of it. 
</P>
<P>
Second, aren't we talking about Polish land? What would the U.S. think if a 
foreign group came here and tried to dictate where we could put what. Americans 
would go through the roof and rightly so. The Jews who were beaten were 
illegally trespassing. They were lucky that was all that happened to them. 
After all, Palestinian children protesting Israeli occupation of their land 
have been shot! 
</P>
<P>
I think the Jews would serve their public image, not to mention moral ethics, 
if they would leave the nuns to their prayers and concentrated a lot more 
attention on the holocaust they are creating in the Middle East.

RANCHO BERNARDO MAN, 83, FOUND DEAD IN ALPINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 83-year-old Rancho Bernardo man who had been missing since Thursday was 
found dead Sunday morning in Alpine. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Benjamin Ratner was discovered on a dirt road about a mile south of 
a dead end at the eastern end of Alpine Boulevard, according to sheriff's 
spokesman Sgt. Chris Von Olmhousen. Ratner's 1977 Cadillac Seville was found 
about 200 feet away, stuck in the dirt, Von Olmhousen said. 
</P>
<P>
Though the cause of Ratner's death is still undetermined, homicide detectives 
said there were no signs of foul play. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies responding to a call about a body on the road made the 
discovery at 10:30 a.m. Sunday, and quickly determined that the deceased man 
was Ratner. 
</P>
<P>
Ratner's family had reported him missing at noon Thursday, after he failed to 
pick up his wife, Bernice, at a beauty parlor, as planned. 
</P>
<P>
The family had set up a telephone hot line to receive information about Ratner 
and were offering a reward for information leading to his safe return.

LET CATHOLIC AND JEW SHARE WHERE WE HURT AND WHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY I. SOBEL, Henry I. Sobel is the rabbi of Congregacao Israelita 
Paulista in Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some Jewish organizations, anguished over the failure of Polish Catholic 
officials to honor their agreement to remove a Carmelite convent from the 
grounds of Auschwitz, have issued an emotional appeal for the severing of 
relations between Jewish groups and the Vatican. I opposed such a policy when 
it was first proposed last spring and am even more critical of it today. 
</P>
<P>
The practical effect of breaking off relations is to discontinue dialogue. Yet 
dialogue and discussion between Catholics and Jews are precisely what is needed 
today, not alienation and antagonism. 
</P>
<P>
Three issues threaten to damage the progress in Catholic-Jewish relations that 
has been painstakingly made since the Second Vatican Council more than 20 years 
ago: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Recent statements by Pope John Paul II that appeared to denigrate the 
validity of God's covenant with the Jewish people. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Vatican's persistent refusal to enter into diplomatic relations with 
Israel, while granting a Papal audience to PLO terrorist chief Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The dispute over the Carmelite convent in Auschwitz, which to Jews is 
symbolic of the most painful martyrdom in Jewish history. Two years ago the 
leading church authorities in Poland, Belgium and France -- including Cardinal 
Franciszek Macharski of Krakow -- agreed to relocate the convent by February of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that such issues can be resolved, but only by discussion and 
persuasion, not by threats and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
We have already had a glimpse of the forces of unreason and irresponsibility 
coming to the fore. The actions of a small group of militant Jewish 
demonstrators who scaled a wall and entered the Auschwitz convent's yard, their 
brutal beating by Polish construction workers and the intemperate, blundering 
response by the highest church official in Poland are a forerunner of the 
consequences of formally breaking off communication and dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
There is every reason to believe that responsible forces within the Catholic 
Church will see to it that the agreement to remove the convent is honored. The 
other issues are also susceptible of resolution -- but only if we talk, 
patiently and calmly, each explaining to the other where we hurt and why. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church has acknowledged a need to reaffirm its fundamental kinship 
with Judaism. Jewish communities throughout the world need the Catholic Church 
as an ally against extremists of the left and right. This is particularly true 
of small Jewish communities like those in Latin America, where political 
instability is rampant. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the experience of Brazil, where I have lived and worked since 1970. 
Brazil has more Catholics -- 140 million -- than any other country in the 
world. Its Jewish population is 150,000. Despite this ratio of nearly 1,000 to 
1, relations between Catholics and Jews in Brazil are a model of mutual 
recognition and respect. 
</P>
<P>
This acceptance of religious differences in Brazil follows generations of 
mutual misunderstanding and distrust. The turning point came in 1975, when the 
prison torture and murder of Vladimir Herzog, a young Jewish journalist and 
university professor, aroused many segments of the Brazilian population, 
including Catholic Church leaders. It was the first step toward the 
redemocratization of Brazil, in which the church played an important role. 
</P>
<P>
The new spirit of ecumenism led to recognition by Brazil's Roman Catholic 
bishops of the importance of establishing closer ties with other religious 
groups, including Jews. A National Commission for Catholic-Jewish Dialogue was 
organized by the Bishops' Conference, and met with Jewish community 
representatives over five years, culminating in the publication of an 
unprecedented document -- a 187-page manual for promoting discussion between 
Catholics and Jews. The manual, distributed to every diocese and archdiocese in 
Brazil, has served as a text for Catholic-Jewish dialogue and become part of 
the life of the church and the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
"Dialogue," says the manual, "is the best way for overcoming prejudices. It is 
the best way for (Catholics and Jews) to know, listen and adopt new attitudes 
of respect towards each other." 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church and the Jewish community must keep in mind that in many 
places around the world, both groups are at risk from extremism and bigotry. 
Both of us need allies, even when we must differ with them. We wound ourselves 
and hurt the cause of freedom when we break ties that took so long to build and 
that promise hope of better relations and greater understanding after nearly 20 
centuries of ignorance and fear.

LET THE CONTRAS FIND A HAVEN REBUILDING PEACE IN NICARAGUA, NOT LIVING IN THE 
U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DORIS MEISSNER, Doris Meissner is a senior associate at the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace, Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of the Central American presidents' plan for demobilizing the 
Nicaraguan resistance, three Contra commanders were granted political asylum in 
the United States and four more requested it. The speed with which the 
applications were filed and approved points to the possibility of a serious and 
misguided policy change -- that those Contras who do not trust the Sandinista 
regime will be given haven here as refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has never suggested a refugee program for the Contra 
forces, but the pressures that could lead there are beginning to build. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Contra organization feels betrayed by the Honduras accords, which 
call for demobilization and repatriation of their military force by December. 
The Contras feel doubly stung by the agreement of the opposition inside 
Nicaragua to settle the cause at next February's elections. U.S. conservatives 
are fuming about perfidy in the State Department and the inevitability of 
rigged elections. Miami's sizable Nicaraguan community, in part the product of 
Ronald Reagan's generous asylum policy, is a natural magnet. 
</P>
<P>
The refugee option has always hovered about the edges of the Nicaraguan debate, 
the presumed fallback if the day of reckoning ever came. It flows from the 
causes of Cuba and Vietnam, where we similarly empowered surrogate armies. When 
they were defeated, we mounted aggressive refugee resettlement programs for 
them and their families. A substantial portion of the Cuban and South 
Vietnamese populations at the time are now in this country, a refugee flow that 
has had serious policy implications. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Cuba and Vietnam have been among the slowest nations in the 
communist world to change is not unrelated to this exodus. Unwittingly, and 
with the best intentions, our refugee policy has provided a means for these 
nations to export the critical mass of people most likely to challenge the 
system from within and spark political and economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
This is exactly what we don't want in Nicaragua. If it has not been clear 
before, the Central American presidents' agreement, along with the one between 
the Sandinistas and domestic opposition parties, sends an unequivocal message: 
The Sandinistas will not be eliminated outright. The battlefield is now 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Our policy must be to promote political pluralism and the right to free speech, 
press and elections. Because the resistance encompasses the very people most 
likely to fight for these conditions, repatriation of the Contras is crucial. 
Offering the option of coming here would remove a potential source of internal 
pressure, making it easier for the Sandinistas to maintain their closed system. 
</P>
<P>
The reference point should not be Cuba and Vietnam. It should be Poland. 
</P>
<P>
When Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed martial law eight years ago, a surge of 
refugees seemed inevitable. Although many Poles wished to leave and expected 
that the United States would welcome them, we did not establish a special 
program. In fact, we rejected many applicants, despite sustained pressure from 
the Polish-American and other political constituencies to open our arms. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening years, the Solidarity movement grew, until its strength 
finally cracked 40 years of Communist domination. Is it conceivable that this 
would have happened if we had offered an alternative future in this country to 
large numbers of Poles who opposed Communist rule? No, because these stunning 
changes could not have occurred without a sizable, committed internal 
opposition pushing for change. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that we should press all those who oppose dictatorships to 
remain in their countries and fight for change. The Castro regime imprisoned 
and tortured its enemies; the North Vietnamese sentenced theirs to brutal 
re-education camps and, often, to death. Our first duty should always be to 
protect life and safety, particularly for those who fought loyally for our 
ideas, regardless of the longer-term geopolitical implications. 
</P>
<P>
But where there is some middle ground, some assurance that basic human rights 
will be observed, our policy should be to resist and discourage the refugee 
option. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua offers such a middle ground. The agreement it signed provides that 
demobilization and repatriation be carried out under the auspices of an 
international verification commission formed by the United Nations and the 
Organization of American States. The commission's duties include "monitoring 
the full exercise of the fundamental rights and freedoms of those repatriated. 
. . . " Its mandate extends to establishing offices and follow-up visits, so 
people can report noncompliance. 
</P>
<P>
This mechanism is unique and rather extraordinary. It provides a sound basis 
for the United States and most of the Contra troops and their families -- an 
estimated 50,000 people -- to have confidence that they can safely return to 
Nicaragua if the agreement's protections are upheld. The refugee-status 
fallback would be required, then, only in cases where unusual circumstances 
pertain. 
</P>
<P>
But the Contras and their leaders will need to be convinced. In this and other 
respects, we retain considerable influence if we throw our weight behind the 
presidents' agreement and become a partner in making it work. Crucial to that 
is the Contras' return to their homeland and contributing to its future, 
politically and economically. 
</P>
<P>
If there's any doubt as to the wisdom of rejecting the refugee option, remember 
Poland.

CALLER LEADS PARENTS TO MISSING CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego couple was reunited with their missing 18-month-old daughter, 
apparently abducted in Tijuana on Labor Day, after they received an anonymous 
call Saturday directing them to a church south of the border, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandro and Teresa Aguirre of the 2400 block of 40th Street in East San Diego 
had made numerous public appeals for their daughter, Sandra Veronica, after a 
witnesses reportedly saw a large-framed woman walk off with the child on Avenue 
Revolucion during a family trip to Tijuana last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents were in a shoe store about 6 p.m. when the child apparently walked 
away," said Bill Robinson, a police spokesman. "Then an eye-witnesses came 
forth with information about a Latino woman's involvement." 
</P>
<P>
State Judicial Police in Baja California were handling the case but San Diego 
police said they received numerous reports that the child had been seen as far 
south as Rosarito Beach and as far north as a grocery store on University 
Avenue in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We received dozens of calls," Robinson said. "That's the way it is with 
children and pets, people call." 
</P>
<P>
The couple's search ended Saturday when a woman, speaking in Spanish, told them 
that their daughter could be found at a church on Second Avenue in Tijuana, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra, the youngest of the couple's four children, was unharmed and wearing 
the same outfit as when she disappeared, pink overalls, a white shirt and 
tennis shoes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were not sure if the caller was the same woman who apparently 
walked off with the child.

NAVY COPTER CRASHES, 3 MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GLIONNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three people were missing late Sunday after a Navy helicopter with six on board 
crashed into the Pacific while on military exercises, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The mishap occurred shortly after 11 a.m. about 18 miles southwest of Camp 
Pendleton as the UH-1N "Huey" reportedly radioed that it was going down, 
according to Marine Capt. Chris Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
The chopper was en route from San Diego to its home ship, the Long Beach-based 
amphibious assault ship Peleliu, and was about three miles from the ship when 
it encountered trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Three crewmen -- two pilots and a crew chief -- along with three passengers 
were on board when the helicopter went down, authorities said. One pilot was 
apparently among the three survivors transported to the Balboa Navy Hospital in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
One of those rescued was listed in serious condition with a head injury. The 
other two reportedly suffered minor injuries, Capt. Gillette said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy is not releasing the identification of the survivors nor the missing 
men pending notification of relatives. The cause of the crash is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"The Peleliu was the mother ship," Capt. Gillette said. "It appears the 
helicopter sent out word before it went down that it was having difficulty." 
</P>
<P>
The "Huey" helicopter is a light utility aircraft that can hold up to 10 
people. "The Navy uses it to get people from ship to ship and deliver mail," 
said Lt. Patrick Gibbons, a Marine spokesman at Camp Pendleton. "It doesn't 
hold many people. It's pretty light." 
</P>
<P>
The Peleliu dispatched a transport boat and several helicopters to assist in 
the search, which also involved a Coast Guard cutter and several other Navy 
aircraft, which arrived on the scene from area bases, Capt. Gillette said. 
</P>
<P>
"The assault ship also has a squadron of 24 helicopters," Capt. Gillette said. 
"I'm sure that not all were dispatched, but enough to cover the search area." 
</P>
<P>
The Peleliu is participating in exercises involving the Navy's Amphibious 
Squadron Three, based in San Diego, and the 15th Marine Expeditionary force 
based at Camp Pendleton, Lt. Givens said. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Kernal Usher, the nine-day deployment exercises end Sept. 14 and involve 
at least six Navy ships and more than 15,000 Navy and Marine personnel, he 
said.

IMMIGRANT INFLUX MEETS HOSTILITY IN RURAL SOUTH 
</P>

ONEONTA, Ala. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ernie Pantoja traveled the migrant worker stream from Mexico through Chicago, 
Florida, Tennessee and other Southern states before arriving here in 1985 and 
"settling out" of the flow. 
</P>
<P>
Pantoja, 34, now earns a living year round by picking tomatoes and planting 
pine trees in this quiet farm community about 35 miles northeast of Birmingham. 
It's backbreaking work, but he says it's worth it because he likes small-town 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago was kind of dangerous," said Pantoja, speaking with quiet intensity. 
"Florida, too. Then I came here. It was kind of quiet." 
</P>
<P>
For similar reasons, the huge influx of Asian and Latino immigrants that in 
recent years swept into the big cities of the North and West is increasingly 
turning to the South. Many succeed in finding jobs, peace and tranquility. But 
as their numbers increase in rural areas, others are finding something else: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Greenville, Miss., Wai Ma, a restaurant owner, carries a .38-caliber 
Smith &amp; Wesson on his hip because two Chinese grocers have been robbed and 
shot to death in his town in the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Hong Kong, he lived in Cleveland before moving to Mississippi seven 
years ago, attracted by "a small town where things went easy and slow." But 
"for the last year or so," said Ma, "things are tough. People have started 
killing people." 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Raleigh, N.C., Ming Hai Loo was killed in a pool hall in July, hit on 
the back of the head with a pistol and slammed to the ground, where his face 
struck a beer bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses quoted two white brothers as saying before the incident: "Because of 
you people, our brothers and friends went to Vietnam and never came back. We 
are going to finish you tonight." Loo was Chinese. The brothers were charged in 
the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Gainesville, Ga., about 300 members of the Ku Klux Klan marched on the 
Saturday before Labor Day "to protest the thousands of filthy, illegal wetbacks 
that have ruined this fine north Georgia town," said a klan flyer. 
</P>
<P>
According to the 1980 census, 14,622 Chinese, 12,536 Japanese and 9,273 
Vietnamese lived in six Southern states -- Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, North 
Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Those numbers are expected to jump 
dramatically in the next census. Latinos, who numbered 127,300 in 1980, had 
grown to 154,900 in those states five years later. 
</P>
<P>
"As the influx increases, the (social) pressures increase," said Ozell Sutton, 
southeast regional director of the Community Relations Service, an arm of the 
Justice Department that works to ease ethnic friction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built-In Hostility 
</P>
<P>
The problem is particularly acute in the homogenous rural and small town areas 
that typify much of the South. Here, unlike the urban North and West, large 
ethnic communities built by immigrants and children of immigrants are virtually 
unknown. As immigration to the South has increased, a clear pattern has 
emerged: The first immigrants to a Southern community find curiosity and 
hospitality. But as their numbers grow, so does the likelihood of hostility. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Moreno of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund 
recalled that as a child in a migrant family he lived a while in Mississippi 
during the late 1950s. There, he said, the family was "considered exotic. 
Everybody wanted to talk to the family, learn about our ethnic background, eat 
my mom's enchiladas and tortillas." 
</P>
<P>
But when the larger community began to fear they were losing jobs to 
immigrants, the family became "less exotic and more a threat; the attitude 
changed," Moreno said. "I'm afraid as the (Southern immigrant) community grows, 
there will be some tension." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as a 'Novelty' 
</P>
<P>
Po Chan, who was born in China and now lives in Raleigh, said he is perceived 
as a "novelty" in groups where he is the only Chinese. "When people don't feel 
threatened," they "treat me special." However, "when you have a group getting 
larger and larger and competing . . . then they feel threatened." 
</P>
<P>
Many immigrants complain that they are caught between two prejudices, one 
black, the other white. Black people accuse them of taking jobs and making 
money off black neighborhoods without reinvesting. White people accuse them of 
taking jobs and reject them because of their ethnic heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The klan march was targeted at Gainesville immigrants who often work at 
low-skill, low-pay jobs in the agriculture and poultry businesses. "It's as if 
the klan thinks its constituency has some great desire to go into those chicken 
coops and pluck chickens," said Eva Sears of the Center for Democratic Renewal, 
an organization that monitors hate group activity. 
</P>
<P>
Melinda Yee, executive director of the Organization of Chinese Americans, said: 
"People tend to get territorial, despite the fact that (the newcomers) are 
bringing in business and money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dates White Woman 
</P>
<P>
Ma, the pistol-packing restaurant owner, believes black robbers shot the 
grocers in Greenville. Whites, he said, stare in hostility when he goes out 
with his white fiancee. "You can see the expression on their faces," he said. 
"What's that white girl doing with that Chinese?" 
</P>
<P>
Paul Igasaki of the Japanese-American Citizens League recalls a friend's horror 
when she traveled through a small town in Georgia and heard a television 
announcer "using the term 'Jap' quite comfortably. She called the station and 
they said they didn't think it was derogatory." 
</P>
<P>
Along the Gulf Coast, clashes between Vietnamese and American-born fishermen 
became commonplace as the newcomers began settling there in the 1970s. Now such 
friction is played down, but as the population of Southeast Asians rises, other 
problems emerge. 
</P>
<P>
In Biloxi, Miss., Charlie Pham, a co-owner of an insurance firm, complained 
that police failed to help him retrieve his stolen typewriter, even when they 
knew the thief. "I don't want to say it is discrimination," he said, "but it is 
the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Pham's business partner, Thomas Vu, said it is dangerous for Vietnamese to walk 
the streets. "Whenever black people see Vietnamese people, they stop and rob 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Model Minority' 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants everywhere share the problem of language barriers, which, according 
to experts, can make newcomers tentative, unwilling to assert their rights. 
Asians, in particular, say they suffer from what they call the "model minority" 
syndrome that keeps some from speaking out about injustice and prevents 
outsiders from perceiving their problems. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Oneonta, population 5,000, the number of immigrants, mostly Latinos, is 
still small, and townspeople are trying to ease the transition from 
all-American town to an international one. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the problems of gangs and different groups," said Mayor Danny 
Hicks. "It doesn't matter whether you're white, black or Hispanic. People just 
want to be treated right." 
</P>
<P>
And many U.S.-born residents say they get along fine with the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Dempsey, a white cashier at a gas station out on U.S. 231, said: "I've had 
'em move in all around me, and they come in here and never give me no 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are signs of the pressures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Followed Into Store 
</P>
<P>
Matter of factly, Pantoja said he and other Latinos have been followed in a 
local store because the manager "thought we were going to steal something." 
Sometimes when Americans "don't know your name, they say 'Hey, Mexican,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Along the red dirt roads that wind through nearby Straight Mountain and 
Chandler Mountain, tomato fields and processing plants dot the landscape. 
Trucks carry loads of Mexican workers to and from the fields, where, according 
to Pantoja, a worker can earn $250 to $300 "in a good week." 
</P>
<P>
In the brutally hot climate, some workers hang their sweaty work shoes under 
porch awnings rather than bring them inside houses where several young men 
often sleep in one room on beds made up on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Driving his van through the area, Joe Castillo, who was born in Ohio, grew up 
in Texas and moved here in 1973, angrily recounted complaints that he hears 
from many workers. The problem, he said, is not just low pay. "Sometimes it's 
no pay. They (farmers) work them for a day or two and then run them off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Radio Program Helps 
</P>
<P>
Castillo recently began a radio program in Spanish to inform Latinos of their 
rights as employees, and to provide information on immigration, English 
classes, which he teaches, and other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting around a table at Corpus Christi Church, several officials of the 
Birmingham Diocese's Hispanic Ministry -- including Irma Nolla, the program 
director, and Graciela Comontofski, a volunteer coordinator -- ticked off 
problems that grow as the area's Latino population grows: shortage of 
affordable housing, poor working conditions, lack of bilingual safety signs on 
jobs, no bilingual driving tests. 
</P>
<P>
"The immigrants come here and sweat and work to help the economy, but when they 
want a driver's license, nobody wants to help them," Comontofski said.

RAID RULES BEING TIGHTENED; 
</P>
<P>
RISING TIDE OF DRUG CASH TESTING HONESTY OF POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Lewis Wilson traveled from Florida last month to share his drug-fighting 
experiences with a commission of California law enforcement officials, he was 
surprised by their opening questions. 
</P>
<P>
The California officials, led by Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, did 
not ask him first about the successful tactics used by police task forces in 
Miami, but about corruption problems. "A whole agency is not going to be 
corrupt. There are going to be pockets," answered Wilson, who heads the Miami 
office of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"They hit me pretty hard on that," Wilson said later, recalling the 
commission's unexpected focus on ethical issues. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, it was clear that the line of questioning was no abstract 
exercise. A distraught Block announced that nine veteran members of his 
narcotics bureau had been suspended and were under investigation for allegedly 
stealing cash confiscated in drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
"Corruption has apparently touched members of my department," Block said. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone was shocked that there might be such misconduct in the region 
where police confiscate more cocaine cash than anywhere else in the United 
States -- they reported seizing an astounding $100 million from suspected drug 
dealers last year. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the glamorous task forces that pursue high-level drug traffickers 
readily acknowledge that increased potential for corruption -- necessitating 
new precautions -- is an inescapable byproduct of the suddenly almost routine 
discoveries of huge sums of cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people were aware that sooner or later, there was going to be an incident 
of some kind," said Lt. Mike Post, who heads the drug squad of the Glendale 
Police Department. "It was inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Police Lt. David Marsden, who heads one of the most active drug squads 
in California, explained the new temptations this way: "We were sailing along 
with 50 years of history where you may have gotten $20,000 or $40,000 cases 
once in a blue moon. You sat down and counted the money. All of a sudden, we 
have the Colombian drug money coming in." 
</P>
<P>
The result? "I've had over $1 million in the trunk of my car on three 
occasions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Fantasizing' 
</P>
<P>
Marsden said he does not allow himself to imagine what he could do with that 
kind of money. "It's too scary to even fantasize," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The task forces that deal with large amounts of cash, including the sheriff's 
narcotics bureau, all follow procedures designed to guard against corruption -- 
and also to protect officers against unfounded allegations that they pocketed 
cash, drugs or other property. 
</P>
<P>
Raids are carried out by large teams and a second officer, usually a sergeant 
or higher-ranking supervisor, is immediately called to any spot where 
contraband is uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
In some units, the cash and drugs are photographed before they are moved. They 
are never transported by a single officer. And only specialized crews, or 
banks, count the cash -- a process carried out after the money is removed 
because it would simply take too long to count $200,000, or $2 million, at a 
raided home. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Sheriff's Department, cash is transported in what officials 
describe as tamper-proof bags that were developed for banks. At headquarters, 
it is locked up under security that resembles something out of an Indiana Jones 
movie: The bags are put in a safe behind a locked door that is connected to an 
alarm. Only lieutenants have the combination to the safe, and to open the 
locked door, you need a special key -- which is kept in another safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cracks in the Rules 
</P>
<P>
But even the tightest precautions leave two openings for corruption: at the 
instant a lone officer stumbles on the cash or drugs, and when there is a 
conspiracy among members of a squad. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have an officer searching a house and he discovers a suitcase (filled 
with money) in the garage and he's by himself, that's where everybody is most 
vulnerable . . . to slip a bundle out," said Marsden. "The worst part is at the 
moment it's found. Then, slowly but surely, more checks come in." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Bob Wilber, who heads the sheriff's narcotics bureau, said: "If a 
person's going to be a thief and he's alone . . . it's going to be difficult to 
control." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the suspended sheriff's deputies, the suggestion is that they 
skimmed off money at this sensitive point. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials have not disclosed the evidence against the deputies, but 
other sources said federal agents videotaped at least two of them taking cash 
from a money bag and putting it into a separate pouch during a raid on a San 
Fernando Valley hotel. The raid reportedly was staged by federal agents in a 
sting operation aimed at gathering evidence against the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have yet been filed, but one federal law enforcement source has said 
that at least $200,000 might have been taken in various narcotics raids during 
the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The danger of corruption is not limited to the big money cases that make 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow Skimming Charged 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles police officer was charged with five counts of embezzling public 
funds last month, after an internal investigation found that he had pocketed 
$270 while arresting five street-level drug dealers in the San Fernando Valley. 
"He was not booking all the money," police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said. 
"He was siphoning off a little bit at a time." 
</P>
<P>
The dimensions of the potential problem changed, however, after Congress passed 
the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, which allows law enforcement 
agencies to keep up to 90% of the assets they seize. 
</P>
<P>
In a time of budget constraints, that provision provided a way of paying for 
new helicopters, computers or lasers to read fingerprints, and also of 
financing drug education programs. The glorious part was that the crooks paid 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The net effect was that police found themselves with an extra incentive to seek 
out illicit cash just as the "crack" cocaine trade began to explode. 
</P>
<P>
Total cash seizures by the Sheriff's Department jumped from $2.8 million in 
1984 to $33.9 million in 1988. By late last year, about $18 million already had 
been returned to the Los Angeles Police Department under the asset forfeiture 
provision, and claims for $24 million more were pending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roving Police Teams 
</P>
<P>
The largest police agencies were not the only ones who got into the act. Around 
Southern California, nearly a dozen police departments in mid-sized cities 
assigned teams of up to eight officers each to specialize in high-stakes 
investigations of suspected major drug traffickers. These squads, from 
communities such as Glendale, Fullerton, Torrance, Simi Valley and West Covina, 
had authority to follow drug -- and money -- trails well beyond their municipal 
boundaries, and soon were making splashy busts throughout the region, sometimes 
in joint operations. 
</P>
<P>
Just last weekend, officers from Glendale, Redondo Beach and Torrance arrested 
eight Colombians and seized 1,276 pounds of cocaine (found in compartments 
under the floor of a house) in raids on six locations -- all in the San Gabriel 
Valley, well out of their territories. 
</P>
<P>
The potential for corruption is increased by the fact that suspects rarely dare 
to claim ownership of cash found during such raids. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants anything to do with it," said Wilson, the Florida official who 
appeared Aug. 29 before California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's Commission 
on Narcotics, which is chaired by Block. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$200,000 Unclaimed 
</P>
<P>
Wilson recalled how two of his agents stopped a car several years ago and found 
$200,000 in the trunk. "The occupants didn't own the car (and) they denied 
knowledge of the $200,000," he said. The agents easily could have walked away 
with the money if they wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he has heard crooked officers rationalize taking the drug cash by 
saying that "it's bad guys' money." 
</P>
<P>
The two major corruption cases in Miami have involved groups of officers 
"basically becoming a criminal conspiracy in and among themselves," he said. 
"People would be enforcing 80% of the time, then ripping off 20% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
First came the "Cocaine Cops" a decade ago, members of a special drug-homicide 
unit who were protecting some narcotics traffickers and stealing from others. 
Then, a few years ago, there were the "Miami River Cops," athletic young 
officers who preyed on drug dealers and others while working the night shift 
along the Miami River. 
</P>
<P>
One of those officers drove a red Lotus, a car that cost four times his annual 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recruits Poorly Screened 
</P>
<P>
In that case, poor screening of recruits was largely to blame, Wilson told the 
California commission. The officers were among a large group that joined the 
force after a hiring freeze, and the department did few background checks. Some 
of the newcomers, it turned out, were basically thugs and had friendships or 
family ties with drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles County sheriff's officials, perhaps the most painful part of 
their brewing scandal is that the eight deputies and a sergeant who were 
suspended are anything but novices. None had less than nine years experience 
and, by the nature of their assignment, all were among the department's elite. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who target major violators, they're a step up," said Wilber, who 
would not disclose the total number of officers in the special drug units. "We 
try to select those people as the best officers. We look closely at a person's 
previous history, allegations against him, his appraisals by superiors." 
</P>
<P>
And after they are selected, "we talk about integrity issues frequently," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Corruption Rules 
</P>
<P>
Partially as a precaution against an established group of narcotics officers 
settling into conspiratorial corruption, many departments rotate officers 
through the special units, limiting service to three years in one case. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has no such policy, but Wilber said that other new 
procedures may be called for, such as testing for drug use and "reviews" of 
team members' personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
Wilber also mentioned periodic "integrity testing" procedures similar to those 
banks use to see if tellers are honest -- perhaps setting up a raid in which 
supervisors plant a known amount of cash, then monitor how much money is turned 
in. 
</P>
<P>
One federal source said the money-skimming inquiry began after receipt of an 
anonymous letter, traced to a sheriff's copying machine, warning of "bad cops." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, an attorney for a Mexican national arrested by three of the 
deputies in a drug money-laundering case last November complained to federal 
prosecutors that the $135,000 the deputies logged as evidence was far short of 
the amount his client had been carrying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discrepancies in Cash 
</P>
<P>
"This happens all the time in these cases," said the attorney, Victor Sherman. 
"You mention it to prosecutors, and they just shrug. They're not interested." 
</P>
<P>
Although most drug traffickers try to disassociate themselves from money seized 
in raids, periodically such complaints are lodged, task force leaders say. 
"Investigations are done," said Glendale's Lt. Post. "We've found they are 
either bogus claims or we inadvertently missed the money." 
</P>
<P>
A search team may overlook a hiding place, he said, and "one of the crooks" 
later retrieves the money for himself. The "crook" then has to explain to 
higher-ups why all the money he was given is not accounted for in the official 
charges, and blames a police rip-off. 
</P>
<P>
Such allegations are one reason that police procedures for handling money are 
so tight, officials say. "It's just sound management practice to always provide 
a defense for your officers," said Marsden, whose Torrance task force has 
seized more than $2 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
Bill May, a USC professor who teaches business and medical ethics and has 
conducted seminars for the state Commission on Peace Officer Standards and 
Training, says the most serious problem may not be the isolated group of 
crooked officers, but other officers who know what is going on and don't report 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a long tradition of the code of silence," he said. "There are two 
reasons for this: They are protecting another officer, and they are protecting 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Police who regularly find themselves carrying satchels with hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in cash say that, in the end, it is essential to have 
rules to minimize reliance on trust in the handling of money. How can an 
officer who is earning $35,000 a year and is trying to pay the mortgage not be 
tempted at some level by a shoe box filled with $20 bills? 
</P>
<P>
"On a couple of different occasions, I've had from $500,000 to a couple of 
million sitting on a desk in front of me," said Post. "You've got to look at it 
as other than money, as just a bundle of property. 
</P>
<P>
"If you say, 'There's a mink coat for my wife, or two Ferraris for the garage,' 
you've taken a step in the wrong direction." 
</P>
<P>
For police officials who may have been lulled by the California law enforcement 
agencies' nationwide reputation as among the most honest and progressive in the 
country, Post said, the incident in the Sheriff's Department may be a good 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"If the initial indications are true," he said, "that's going to wake the last 
of the sleeping administrators up."

Frederick V. Malek, who resigned as a top Bush campaign adviser and deputy 
Republican party chairman last fall over a controversy from his days as a 
Richard M. Nixon White House aide, is being recruited by the Administration to 
run next year's economic summit with major Western allies, the White House 
said. Malek, 51, has apologized for the 1971 incident, when he wrote a memo on 
how many top Bureau of Labor Statistics officials were Jewish. He has said he 
wrote the memo only after ignoring several earlier demands from then-President 
Nixon for the information. Recently the business executive has met privately 
with leaders of American Jewish organizations -- both to tell his side of the 
story and to convey his apologies. Jewish leaders said they and their 
organizations accepted Malek's apology.

Silent, windless surges from Hurricane Gabrielle far out in the Atlantic Ocean 
whipped up huge waves, sweeping beach-goers out to sea and capsizing boats from 
Maine to New York. At least six people were reported missing in accidents the 
Coast Guard said were related to the sea swells, undertow and waves up to 15 
feet high, even on rivers. Waves from the storm swamped a 42-foot houseboat off 
New York City, washing its 11 occupants overboard, authorities said. One woman 
drowned and a 35-year-old man was reported missing. Gabrielle's wind had 
weakened to 75 m.p.h. and the storm was located 600 miles east of New Jersey 
and 335 miles south of Sable Island, Nova Scotia, the National Weather Service 
in Boston said.

Silent, windless surges from Hurricane Gabrielle far out in the Atlantic 
whipped up huge waves, sweeping beach goers out to sea and capsizing boats from 
Maine to New York. But by late in the day, Gabrielle's winds had weakened to 65 
m.p.h. and it was downgraded to a tropical storm. Gabrielle was located 350 
miles south-southwest of Sable Island, Nova Scotia, the National Hurricane 
Center in Florida said. Earlier, at least six people were reported missing and 
three people apparently drowned in mishaps officials said were related to the 
sea swells, undertow and waves up to 15 feet high, even on some rivers. "People 
shouldn't be out there," said Jarred Randall, a Narragansett, R.I., police 
sergeant who rescued two teen-agers from the water.

Iran's Parliament condemned 186 U.S. congressmen for endorsing Iranian 
resistance groups and declared that their action will unleash unspecified 
"consequences." Tehran Radio quoted Parliament Speaker Mahdi Karrubi as saying 
that "U.S. leaders will take the wish of overthrowing the Islamic Republic to 
their graves." In a letter addressed to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, 
121 Democrats and 65 Republicans last week warned the Administration against 
"continuing to speculate and hope for the miraculous emergence of moderates 
from within the present ruling clique" in Iran.

Hong Kong's government removed 2,500 Vietnamese "boat people" from the outlying 
island of Tai A Chau after an outbreak of cholera and moved them to a nearby 
island that once served as a leper colony, officials reported. Another 2,000 
Vietnamese living in tents on Tai A Chau will be evacuated to Heiling Chau 
island today, the officials said. Last month, a dispute over distribution of 
rice touched off a riot on Tai A Chau. Shortly afterward, the first case of 
cholera was detected, and the disease has so far stricken 21 Vietnamese, 
officials said. They said Tai A Chau will be used as a detention center again, 
once it has been cleaned up and huts are built there.

The Energy Department wants to curtail development of a nuclear reactor to 
power weapons for a space-based missile shield or for manned bases on the moon, 
the New York Times reported. The paper quoted federal officials as saying that 
the department wants to stop spending on the reactor because of rising budget 
pressure and opposition from private groups and Congress. The Energy Department 
now provides most of the funding for the 4.2-ton reactor, known as the SP-100, 
which is meant to generate 100 kilowatts of electricity and to fit in the space 
shuttle. One Pentagon official told the newspaper the proposed cut would leave 
the reactor program "severely crippled." But other officials who were not 
identified said the proposed cut could be a ploy to get other federal agencies 
to increase their financial support.

Ivan Drach, a Ukrainian poet and political activist, was elected to lead a new 
grass-roots group fighting for greater autonomy for the Soviet republic, 
according to a spokesman in Moscow for the Ukrainian Helsinki Group that 
monitors human rights. He also said that Sergei Konyev, a member of the new 
Soviet Parliament, was chosen as a deputy to Drach. The group, initially called 
the Ukrainian Popular Movement for Perestroika, was renamed Rukh, Ukrainian for 
movement, on the final day of a three-day meeting in the republic's capital, 
Kiev. Konyev and another speaker at the meeting have called for removal of the 
conservative Ukrainian Communist Party chief, Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky.

More than a thousand worshipers cheered as Father George A. Stallings Jr. 
called for a boycott of businesses that advertise in the Washington Post, and 
he denounced allegations published in the Post that he had a sexual 
relationship 12 years ago with an altar boy. "We're going to get you, 
Washington Post, because of your sleazy journalism, because of your obsession 
to create a story where there is no story," the dissident Roman Catholic priest 
told a packed auditorium. Post Managing Editor Leonard Downie Jr. later said in 
reply: "We believe we have treated the Rev. Stallings fairly."

5 ARRESTED IN MELEE AT GAY FESTIVAL IN SANTA ANA 
</P>

Five people were arrested Sunday when a fist-swinging brawl broke out among 
more than 50 militant gays and fundamentalist Christians at Orange County's 
first gay pride festival in Santa Ana's Centennial Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 riot-equipped police from four different departments were called in to 
quell the disturbance, but no serious injuries were reported as the two-day 
festival concluded Sunday evening. The five people arrested -- all believed to 
be members of gay rights groups -- were taken to the Santa Ana police station 
where they were to be cited for interfering with police and released. Their 
names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing riot helmets and swinging batons, police had to keep separating the two 
sides, which continued to taunt each other for nearly an hour, until enough 
officers arrived to maintain control. 
</P>
<P>
Police ordered organizers of the Orange County Cultural Pride Festival to lock 
the gates to the festival grounds for a half hour after the brawl and 
considered shutting the event down early. Police finally decided to let it 
continue as scheduled for the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 people were on the festival grounds Sunday and were watching and 
applauding a gay pride parade when the violence broke out. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses said about 75 gays, some of them members of the militant gay 
groups Act Up Los Angeles and the Orange County Visibility League, encircled 
about 20 to 25 fundamentalists about 1:30 p.m. on a grassy knoll at an entrance 
to the park. 
</P>
<P>
The gays began chanting, "Kiss, kiss, kiss," and several pairs began kissing 
each other. Several of the fundamentalists, clearly outnumbered, tried to 
retreat as they yelled, "Repent! Repent!" 
</P>
<P>
"It was scary. All of a sudden the homosexuals surrounded us and began doing 
stuff to provoke us," said Forrest Ricker, a 60-year-old fundamentalist from 
Orange. "I held up my two Bibles and asked God to forgive them." 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, Ricker said, police wrestled two of the gays to the ground, 
pinning them to the asphalt with their batons. 
</P>
<P>
"For several minutes, chaos broke out," he said. "I just turned and hustled out 
of there." 
</P>
<P>
Robert F. Gentry, mayor of Laguna Beach and one of Orange County's most visible 
gay politicians, said the clash resulted when "emotions boiled over" on the 
part of gays tired of what he called constant verbal harassment. 
</P>
<P>
"And when you constantly hear voices calling you names, calling you a sinner 
and worse, you reach a breaking point," said Gentry, who was watching the 
parade and estimated that he was several hundred feet from the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the initial clash, witnesses said, other gays standing nearby in a 
growing crowd of about 200 people began pushing the fundamentalists out of the 
park. The two sides called one another names and swung at each other with 
fists, prompting police to rush back in again. Two men were arrested, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fundamentalists Regroup 
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalists at that point left the park, regrouping in a residential 
neighborhood, witnesses said. Police reinforcements, meanwhile, began arriving 
from surrounding jurisdictions, including Costa Mesa, Irvine, Newport Beach and 
Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The police, about 75 by this time and wearing helmets and rubber gloves, formed 
a line along one side of the park and began moving in with billy clubs, forcing 
a crowd that had grown to about 500 people back toward the gay festival 
entrance in the middle of the park, witnesses said. Police made three more 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the bystanders ran back inside the festival, some crying. With emotions 
running high and some gays shouting at police, "You're taking away our civil 
rights," Janet Avery, president of Orange County Cultural Pride, took the stage 
and pleaded for calm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Our Day in the Sun' 
</P>
<P>
"We came here to celebrate," Avery said, as the crowd quieted. "If you have a 
friend who is not here to celebrate, please get them in the mood. This is our 
day in the sun." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Benjamin, a north Orange County fundamentalist who carried a sign that 
read, "Jesus Saves," blamed the gays for the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did they have to go that far?" an angry Benjamin asked. "They have the 
park. They got their way. We were within our rights. I hope they burn in hell."

6 ARRESTED IN MELEE AT GAY FESTIVAL IN SANTA ANA

Six people were arrested Sunday after a fist-swinging brawl broke out among 
more than 50 militant gays and fundamentalist Christians at Orange County's 
first Gay Pride Festival. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 riot-equipped Santa Ana police were called in to Centennial Regional 
Park to quell the disturbance, but no serious injuries were reported as the 
two-day gay festival concluded Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The six people arrested -- identified by police as militant gay activists as 
well as fundamental Christians -- were taken to the Santa Ana police station, 
where they were cited for interfering with police and released. The misdemeanor 
violation carries a maximum $500 penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The arrested were Jade Stone, 21, of San Francisco; Todd Michael Bales, 24, of 
Buena Park; Patrick Kieran Brown, 19, of Placentia; Ruben Mario Chaves, 28, of 
Norwalk; Robert Charles Miller, 32, of Corona, and William Randall Chadwick, 
35, of Corona. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing riot helmets and swinging batons, police had to keep separating the two 
sides, who continued to taunt each other for nearly an hour. Santa Ana Police 
Lt. Robert Helton said police were actively involved for about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Police ordered organizers of the Orange County Cultural Pride Festival to lock 
the gates to the festival grounds for half an hour after the brawl and 
considered shutting the event down early, but decided to let it continue as 
scheduled for the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Festival organizers estimated 10,000 gays attended the festival grounds Sunday 
and were watching and applauding a gay pride parade when the violence broke out 
along the parade route, near the park entrance on Edinger Avenue at Mohawk 
Drive. The parade took place around the park's driving circle but outside the 
gated festival grounds, where visitors had to pay a $10 admission fee. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 gay participants of the parade, some of them members of the militant 
homosexual groups Act Up of Los Angeles and the Orange County Visibility 
League, encircled about 20 to 25 fundamentalists on a grassy knoll near the 
corner of Mohawk and Edinger about 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The gays began chanting "kiss, kiss, kiss," and several pairs began kissing 
each other. Several of the fundamentalists, clearly outnumbered, tried to 
retreat as they yelled "Repent! Repent!" 
</P>
<P>
A moment after the kissing started, the two sides started shoving and hitting 
each other. Police moved in and wrestled two of the gays to the ground, pinning 
them to the asphalt with their batons. 
</P>
<P>
Helton said officers finally intervened in the confrontation after "sporadic 
flare-ups" between the pro-gay and anti-gay factions. 
</P>
<P>
But after the initial fights were quelled, other gays standing nearby in a 
growing crowd of about 200 people began pushing the fundamentalists out of the 
park. The two sides again called each other names and swung with fists, 
prompting police to rush back in again. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalists, at that point, left the park on their own, regrouping 
across Edinger Avenue in a residential neighborhood, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The police -- now numbering about 50 and wearing riot helmets and rubber gloves 
-- formed a line along the Edinger Avenue side of the park and began moving in 
with clubs, forcing a crowd that had grown to about 500 people back toward the 
gay festival entrance in the middle of the park, witnesses said. Police made 
four more arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the bystanders ran back inside the festival, some crying. With emotions 
running high on the festival grounds and some gays shouting at police "You're 
taking away our civil rights," Janet Avery, president of Orange County Cultural 
Pride, took the stage and pleaded for calm. 
</P>
<P>
"We came here to celebrate," Avery said, quieting the crowd. "If you have a 
friend who is not here to celebrate, please get them in the mood. This is our 
day in the sun." 
</P>
<P>
Robert F. Gentry, mayor of Laguna Beach and one of Orange County's most visible 
gay politicians, said the clash resulted when "emotions boiled over" on the 
part of gays tired of what he called constant verbal harassment. The festival, 
Gentry said, marked the "first celebration in Orange County that validates" the 
existence of the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
Members of gay and fundamentalist groups alike expressed concern that Santa Ana 
police did not intervene quickly enough to prevent the clash and that police 
overreacted. 
</P>
<P>
"We took action as soon as it was appropriate for us to take action," Helton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we responded to a potentially very violent situation. We were not 
overly aggressive. We were quite the contrary. We acted swiftly."

BOLSHOI TROUPE ARRIVES FOR ITS ISRAEL DEBUT

Bolshoi ballet dancers arrived Sunday for their eagerly awaited debut in 
Israel, deftly brushing aside questions about the future of diplomatic ties 
between Israel and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union cut ties with Israel after the Israeli-Arab War in 1967, but 
in the last two years, relations have warmed with an exchange of consular 
delegations and increasing contacts. The Bolshoi's performances this month are 
the first in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very important that people will have the opportunity for contact and the 
contact with this language (of dance) helps other contact," said Natalia 
Bessmertnova, the Bolshoi's prima ballerina. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Rich History 
</P>
<P>
As for Israel, Bessmertnova said she is excited to be performing in a country 
rich in history and before a new audience. 
</P>
<P>
Choreography director Yuri Papkov said the purpose of the visit is artistic 
rather than diplomatic, but he added, "We are very experienced dancers of the 
Bolshoi, and wherever there are beginnings of some kind of relations, the 
Bolshoi is one of the first (there)." 
</P>
<P>
The company of 50 dancers includes performers from the Bolshoi as well as other 
troupes in the Soviet Union. They are scheduled for more than a dozen 
performances in Caesarea, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem this month, nearly two years 
after negotiations began for the Soviet dancers to travel to Israel for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 36,000 tickets available for the performances, only 4,000 remain unsold. 
The first performance will be staged on Wednesday in a seaside amphitheater 
beside the ruins of Caesarea.

CHINA'S NEWSPAPERS HEADLINE COMMUNISTS' TOP 40 SLOGANS 
</P>

<P>
They aren't the catchiest slogans in the world, even in the original Chinese. 
But China's leading newspapers gave top-of-page-one display Sunday to 40 of 
them -- some new, some old -- selected to be official slogans of the 40th 
anniversary Oct. 1 of the founding of the People's Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
It may be difficult even for the Communist Party ideologues who compiled the 
list to envision enthusiastic repetition of such slogans as: "Enhance socialist 
democratic and legal construction and consolidate and develop the stable and 
unified political situation!" 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every person in Beijing knows that China's top leadership, far from 
being stable or united, is rent by a fierce struggle over succession to 
85-year-old paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. That, in fact, is why claims of 
unity are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Almost no one, on the other hand, has any idea what "socialist democracy" 
means, if it means anything at all. "Legal construction" does at least have a 
meaning. It refers to China's attempt to gradually rely more on the rule of law 
and less on the whim of administrators and Communist Party bosses. Progress in 
this direction is spotty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neat Summary 
</P>
<P>
Despite their shortcomings, the slogans -- some simplistic, some bombastic, 
some contradictory -- give a neat summary of what preoccupies China's leaders 
today. They form a kind of snapshot of Communist Party policies as the People's 
Republic of China nears its 40th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The slogans reflect a recent shift toward more hard-line ideology, but most 
also address real problems. As in the case of references to stability and 
unity, however, the fact that a subject is embodied in a slogan usually means 
that it concerns an area where the government faces difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Near the top of the list is praise for the June 3-4 martial-law crackdown 
against pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, during which soldiers killed 
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of students and ordinary Beijing residents who 
poured into the streets in a vain attempt to block the army's advance. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Beijing, and of all China, now are supposed to rally behind the 
slogan: "Warmly hail the successful quelling of the turmoil and 
counterrevolutionary rebellion!" Or: "Salute the People's Liberation Army men, 
police and armed police who have performed remarkable feats in the struggle to 
defend the People's Republic." 
</P>
<P>
In a rebuttal to Western condemnation of the brutal June crackdown, people are 
urged: "Maintain the sovereignty of the country and national dignity and firmly 
oppose any foreign interference in China's internal affairs!" 
</P>
<P>
Other slogans reflect the ideological and political tensions inherent in 
government policies that aim to open China to the world and introduce market 
forces, while at the same time trying to maintain a political dictatorship and 
elements of central planning. 
</P>
<P>
"Adhere to the reform and open policies and accomplish the tasks of improving 
the economic environment, straightening out economic order and deepening 
reform," proclaims one slogan, which strings together a series of familiar 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Central Controls 
</P>
<P>
"Straightening out the economic order" is a reference to reassertion of some 
centralized controls to cope with problems such as corruption and inflation. 
The official line is that this will lay the groundwork for further 
market-oriented reforms, but China's most enthusiastic reformists and many 
Western analysts view this "straightening out" as actually being an attack on 
the reforms by hard-line advocates of central planning. 
</P>
<P>
On the ideological front, the people of China must "adhere to the Four Cardinal 
Principles" -- which require support for socialism and the dictatorship of the 
Communist Party -- and "firmly fight against bourgeois liberalization" -- a 
reference to the spread of Western concepts of democracy and civil liberties. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, according to another slogan, China will "carry out the policy 
of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend." 
This slogan was introduced by the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung to encourage a 
period of intellectual liberalization in 1956, which was followed by the 
arrests of many critics. Since then, it has been repeatedly used during periods 
of relaxed political controls. 
</P>
<P>
Such periods, however, have always been followed by renewed crackdowns during 
which some of those who spoke their minds were punished. 
</P>
<P>
Some slogans stress the importance of education, science, culture and the role 
of intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
But in a throwback to the Maoist rhetoric of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, 
one slogan declares: "Wholeheartedly rely on the working class and consolidate 
and develop the worker-peasant alliance." 
</P>
<P>
The people of China also are to "enhance the construction of socialist ethics 
and be socialist citizens with ideals, morality, culture and discipline." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number of Recent Moves 
</P>
<P>
This stress on "socialist ethics" is reflected in a number of recent policy 
moves, including a decision reported Friday by the official New China News 
Agency requiring all high schools and colleges in Beijing to cooperate with 
factories "to have students perform regular manual labor." 
</P>
<P>
For many years, some schools have required students, as part of their 
ideological education, to spend time in workshops. Beijing authorities are now 
determined to expand the practice. Hard-line Communist Party leaders have 
repeatedly claimed that students who participated in this spring's 
pro-democracy protests were divorced from China's social realities. The 
performance of manual labor -- likely to be a few hours per week -- serves both 
as punishment and re-education. 
</P>
<P>
Rhetoric about tougher social and political discipline is also being paired 
with action. In the culmination of several years of preparation, a nationwide 
identity card system is to go into effect Friday, becoming a major new tool of 
authoritarian control. More than 570 million cards have been issued in the last 
few years, with more cards still due to be issued in some remote areas, 
according to Chinese press reports. Citizens over the age of 16 will be 
required to carry the cards at all times, the official China Daily reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Other slogans list a variety of additional tasks, none of them easy: a battle 
against government corruption, protection of the legal rights of women and 
children, population control, protection of the environment and the 
reunification of Nationalist-ruled Taiwan with the Chinese mainland.

A 92-year-old Italian explorer started to climb Mt. Everest on Sunday, Milan 
University said. He is the oldest mountaineer to attempt to scale the world's 
highest peak. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1954, Prof. Ardito Desio was the first to reach the top of the only 
slightly lower K-2 mountain in Kashmir, which is 28,250 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I come back to city life I want to flee, to find a way out among 
simple people," he told colleagues at Milan University before leaving Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The university's secretariat, which was in contact with Desio's base, said he 
is leading a 45-person scientific expedition up 29,028-feet Everest. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera whether the climb would not 
jeopardize his health, Desio retorted: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in perfectly good health, and a huge enthusiasm is pushing me on. If the 
weather turns bad, no problem -- I'll travel back down again to Katmandu (in 
Nepal)."

FAREWELL TO ARM? CONTROVERSY GROWS OVER A HERO IN MEXICO 
</P>

<P>
Gen. Alvaro Obregon's right arm, severed in battle in 1915, stored in his 
doctor's safe for 20 years and displayed in a marble monument for another half 
a century, today is the centerpiece of a modern Mexican controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Although preserved in a jar of formaldehyde, the former President of Mexico's 
legendary arm has disintegrated over the decades to little more than a wrist 
and hand. The remains are undignified, say friends and family members, and 
should be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
But other patriots see the general's arm as a piece of revolutionary history 
that belongs to Mexico. After all, Obregon lost his limb in battle against his 
famous rival, Francisco (Pancho) Villa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Very Presentable' 
</P>
<P>
"It is not very presentable," said Mayo Obregon, the general's 71-year-old son. 
"Some people think it should remain as a symbol because it was the arm that 
gave orders. Some people say it's the arm that defeated Villa. But I look at it 
as his son. That is the arm of my ancestor." 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Ayar Garcia, 82, the bespectacled caretaker of the Obregon Monument for 
the last 30 years, is among those who believe that the general's arm should 
stay right where it is. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become a part of history and to take it away would be to change history 
a little bit," Ayar said tearfully. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, he said, scores of tourists visit the tomb in southern Mexico City; 
on Sundays the visitors number in the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
"They come from the United States and other countries. What is clear is that 
people come to see the hand," Ayar said. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors last Monday included two university students studying Mexican 
history, a businessman from the state of Michoacan and a housewife with her 
vacationing brothers from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Looks Pretty Gross' 
</P>
<P>
"It looks pretty gross to me," said Rafael Retana, 25, who was, nonetheless, 
headed down the block to see the mummies of friars at the Convent del Carmen. 
He insisted his whole trip was not a tour of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no, on the way back home we'll go to the Grand Canyon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Retana's nephew, Jason, 8 1/2, was unimpressed by the general's preserved hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It just looks like a regular hand," he said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
The monument that houses the general's arm, however, is unquestionably 
impressive. A three-story obelisk with oversize pewter doors, it is built on 
the site of La Bombilla restaurant where Obregon was assassinated in 1928 by a 
religious fanatic posing as a sketch artist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bullet Holes Remain 
</P>
<P>
At the entrance, the massive, one-armed bronze statue of Obregon stares into a 
marbled pit that marks the place where he was shot. A piece of the original 
cement floor remains with bullet holes from the assassin's gun. A bronze eagle 
spreads its wings overhead. 
</P>
<P>
The walls are covered in pink, gray and black marble from Italy and Mexico. A 
circular stairway, with a low overhang so visitors must bow their heads, leads 
downstairs to the general's arm. Under lock and key and behind a brass grate, 
the rubbery-looking hand sits in a jar of yellow formaldehyde that shines under 
a spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's marvelous. It is proof there was a revolution," said Crecencio Rodriguez, 
43, from Morelia in Michoacan state. But he was somewhat disappointed to 
discover that "the arm is white (due to time and the formaldehyde) and we are 
brown." 
</P>
<P>
The youngest of 18 children in a family from Sonora, Obregon was a rancher and 
factory mechanic before he became a general in the revolutionary army under 
President Venustiano Carranza, which fought and eventually defeated the more 
radical forces of Pancho Villa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mexico's Greatest Battles 
</P>
<P>
In the state of Celaya, Obregon and Villa's troops fought what are considered 
the greatest battles of Mexican history. Mayo Obregon said his father had 
12,000 soldiers on foot to Villa's 30,000 cavalry. He said the general 
neutralized Villa's army by hiding his men in foxholes on a battlefield 
crisscrossed by stone fences that were obstacles to the horses. 
</P>
<P>
"He told his men to fire at the horses. He told them they were each worth three 
of Villa's men on foot," Mayo Obregon said. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Obregon won the Celaya battles, but Villa's men regrouped to attack again 
in Leon in Guanajuato state. There, at the Hacienda Santana del Conde, the 
general lost his right arm to a blast from one of Villa's cannons. 
</P>
<P>
"About a quarter of his arm, three inches above the elbow and three inches 
below were blown away. The lower arm was hanging on by a tendon," Obregon said. 
</P>
<P>
The general whipped out a pistol to kill himself, but an aide took it away, his 
son recounted. The soldier put a tourniquet on the ruptured arm and carried the 
general on a stretcher through plowed fields to his headquarters in a railroad 
car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Named His Replacement 
</P>
<P>
There, before surgery, Mayo Obregon said, the general dictated a telegram to 
President Carranza explaining that he expected to die and asking him to name 
Benjamin Hill to lead the troops in his place. 
</P>
<P>
"I die blessing the revolution," the telegram said. 
</P>
<P>
But Obregon lived through the surgery and went on to become president himself. 
A reputedly corrupt leader, the general liked to say that he was less of a 
thief than other leaders because he only had one arm with which to steal. 
</P>
<P>
There are many tales in Mexican folklore about how Obregon's lost arm was 
recovered. The most famous, Obregon told himself. 
</P>
<P>
According to one account based on an interview that Spanish author Vicente 
Blasco Ibanez had with Obregon, the general laughingly tells of searching for 
his "hand with the broken arm," when an aide offers a solution. 
</P>
<P>
The trusty aide pulled a gold coin out of his pocket and tossed it in the air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Devastating Impulse' 
</P>
<P>
"Immediately from the ground rose a species of bird with five wings. It was my 
hand that, upon feeling the nearness of a gold coin, abandoned its hiding place 
to grab it with a devastating impulse," Obregon allegedly said. 
</P>
<P>
According to his son Mayo, it was Obregon's doctor, Enrique Osornio, who saved 
the severed limb, stuck it in formaldehyde and locked it in a strongbox at his 
hacienda in Aguascalientes state for the next two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Before he died, the doctor turned the arm over to Aaron Saenz, an Obregon aide 
who later served the general's successors, Presidents Elias Calles and Lazaro 
Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
When the Obregon Monument was inaugurated in 1935, Saenz had the arm installed 
there, where it has remained ever since. 
</P>
<P>
But when the arm started to deteriorate a few years ago, the Alvaro Obregon 
Civic Assn., friends and family members of Obregon's revolutionary army, began 
to press for its removal. Mayo Obregon said the general's seven surviving 
children have given the green light to cremate the arm and would like the ashes 
sent to Sonora, where the general is buried next to the remains of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fate Is Unclear 
</P>
<P>
Mexico City officials are unclear on the future of the arm. Monica Burrillo, 
delegate for the Alvaro Obregon neighborhood of the capital, said the arm will 
soon be cremated with military honors in a ceremony conducted by the Defense 
Ministry. However, a Defense Ministry spokeswoman said that was not so. 
</P>
<P>
Mayo Obregon says his father wouldn't have wanted a "pompous" ceremony. He 
knows not when the arm will meet its maker. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed five years ago that it should be incinerated," he said. "In Mexico, 
things take a long time."

PROBE REVEALS ILLEGAL MANUFACTURING OF GENERICS, LAWMAKERS SAY;

DRUG FIRMS' BRIBERY HELD 'TIP OF ICEBERG'

Two generic drug companies already immersed in bribery charges have more 
pervasive problems than originally thought, and the companies likely will be 
investigated by the Justice Department's criminal division, two key members of 
Congress say in documents to be made public today. 
</P>
<P>
An admitted bribery payment to Food and Drug Administration employees "appears 
to be only the tip of the iceberg in a story . . . rife with problems," 
according to statements by Reps. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) and Thomas J. Bliley 
Jr. (R-Va.). Dingell is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and 
its subcommittee on oversight and investigations, while Bliley is the 
subcommittee's ranking Republican. 
</P>
<P>
The congressmen say their subcommittee investigation of the two companies and 
the FDA revealed incidents of fraud and "an attempted cover-up of illegal 
manufacturing practices." They further charge that current top officers 
"attempted to mislead" subcommittee investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Par Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its subsidiary, Quad 
Pharmaceuticals, are expected to be detailed today in a hearing by the 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guilty Pleas 
</P>
<P>
The companies and two former top officials have already pleaded guilty to 
paying off three FDA employees in an attempt to gain speedier approval of their 
generic drugs. Dilip Shah, a founder and former president of Quad, is scheduled 
to be sentenced Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Baltimore. Ashok Patel, a 
founder and former senior vice president of Par, is scheduled to be sentenced 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell and Bliley told the sentencing judge that the company continues to give 
only "grudging and limited" cooperation to the subcommittee. In a letter and 
memo sent Friday to U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove, the congressmen also 
said that the current top officers of the corporation "attempted to mislead" 
congressional investigators "by representing that only two employees out of the 
thousand employees in both companies had been engaged in wrongdoing. . . . That 
is simply not true." 
</P>
<P>
The memo also states that the two current top officers of the corporation -- 
Perry Levine, president, and Jeff Levine, executive vice president -- either 
knew or should have known that the corporation violated federal laws regulating 
the drug industry. Dingell and Bliley said these violations included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Unapproved deviations" in manufacturing equipment and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Destruction or suppression" of evidence and records requested by FDA 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Switches in drug samples that were undergoing tests, and changing formulas 
after they had been submitted for study. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Other unapproved alterations in the chemical formulation of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Unapproved changes in manufacturing sites. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Changes and alterations in record-keeping procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"Any claim of honest ignorance on the part of . . . management is completely 
disingenuous," the congressmen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ignored Problems 
</P>
<P>
Dingell and Bliley charge that corporate officers "failed to conduct any 
investigation of problems" even after they were informed of Shah's involvement 
with illegal payoffs to FDA employees. Further, they say, these same officials 
continued to delay action after the FDA presented them with evidence of false 
statements made by the company in their applications for drug approval. 
</P>
<P>
The Levines initially told the subcommittee "that all illegality at the firm 
was limited to the activities of two employees," Patel and Shah, the lawmakers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they say, "by the end of the same week" Par's attorneys told the 
subcommittee that Jeff Levine "may have been aware of the deliberate 
suppression of evidence" by another of the firm's founders. 
</P>
<P>
Par and Quad officials could not be reached for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The generic drug industry has been the subject of a widening federal probe by 
both the House subcommittee and the U.S. attorney in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Under the charges already brought, Shah and Patel could each receive a maximum 
of two years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and each of the corporations could 
be fined a maximum of $500,000.

Exxon will have to finish the cleanup of the Valdez tanker oil spill in Alaska 
next spring or pay the government to do the job, EPA Administrator William K. 
Reilly said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The job isn't done," Reilly said on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
The company has announced that it is pulling out thousands of cleanup workers 
this week because of the limited daylight and rough weather of Alaska's early 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
In the same interview, Reilly also defended the Administration's plan to 
require cleaner-burning alternatives to gasoline in the worst-polluted cities, 
saying "there is no other way" to curb smog. 
</P>
<P>
On the oil spill issue, Reilly said: "There's a lot still to do. Exxon is going 
to have to go back in the spring, as they intend to do, and survey what the 
problems are and if there's remaining work to do, to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon disagrees with state and federal agencies over the adequacy of the 
company's cleanup efforts since the Exxon Valdez struck a reef in Prince 
William Sound on March 24, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude. 
</P>
<P>
The company claims it has treated more than 1,000 miles of shoreline and is 
nearly done. State authorities say the company is overstating its work. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon plans to return if the Coast Guard makes what the company considers a 
reasonable decision that more cleanup is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said, however, that Exxon has no choice but to abide by the government's 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
If the government determines more cleanup is necessary but Exxon refuses to go 
along, the EPA chief said, the government will continue the cleaning and "bill 
Exxon for the cost."

<P>
Former Justice John A. Arguelles, who retired from the state Supreme Court last 
spring, will join a Los Angeles law firm in November, it was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Arguelles, 62 and a resident of Irvine, will become associated with Gibson, 
Dunn &amp; Crutcher, working primarily out of the firm's Newport Center office 
in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Firm officials said Arguelles will serve as an adviser in both trial and 
appellate level cases, reviewing written briefs and participating in legal 
strategy, and help in the development of programs to settle disputes outside of 
court, such as mediation and private judging. 
</P>
<P>
Arguelles, who was only the second Latino member of the high court, also will 
take on a role in the firm's minority recruitment program, and represent the 
firm in dealings with Bar associations, law schools and community 
organizations, an official of the law firm said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Working on Cases 
</P>
<P>
Since formally stepping down from the court in March, Arguelles, by special 
appointment, has continued to complete work on cases in which he had been 
participating before his retirement. Last week, for example, he joined the 
court majority in a ruling limiting racial challenges to jury compositions and 
dissented in another case restricting a teacher union's use of non-member dues 
for political activities. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected that he will finish his high court assignment on or about Nov. 
1, and will join Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Arguelles has been a judge for 25 years, serving on the Municipal, Superior and 
Appeals court bench before he was appointed to the state Supreme Court in 1987 
by Gov. George Deukmejian.

TELEVISION ON THE MOVE; 
</P>
<P>
IN-CAR VIDEO SCREEN SMALL BUT CRITICS QUESTION SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD E. DUENSING, Duensing is a free-lance writer based in Milford, N.J. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the near future, motorists may see something entirely new when they look at 
their windshields -- a television show that appears to float above the road. It 
may sound farfetched, but Jay Schiffman, an electrical engineer at Auto Vision 
Associates in Ferndale, Mich., has recently received a patent for a device that 
could make it possible. 
</P>
<P>
Called AutoVision, the video system consists of a tiny mirror positioned on the 
windshield above the driver's line of sight to reflect the picture shown by a 
small projector located near the dome light. "The whole thing depends on the 
size, position, and the shape of the mirror," Schiffman said. "It is small 
enough to see around, mounted high enough on the windshield to see under, and 
the curve of its surface creates the illusion that the television image is 
hovering about 15 feet in front of the car." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the feasibility of the technology, the obvious question of the safety of 
a car TV is already being debated by experts. The consensus so far is that the 
device appears to be safe but is not without potential dangers. 
</P>
<P>
Its safety hinges on the optical illusion it creates, called a "virtual image" 
by psychologists, which makes AutoVision's TV image seem to be just another 
part of the landscape. It is as if a small piece of the scenery had been cut 
out and a television screen put in its place. The illusion also makes the 
picture seem much larger than it actually is, allowing the driver to watch the 
screen comfortably without it monopolizing his attention. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to whatever else the driver wishes to view, a small video camera 
mounted near AutoVision's projection unit is pointed at the dashboard and feeds 
the projector. The device is used to display a picture of the dashboard onto 
the screen. By selecting this option, drivers can check their speed, adjust the 
air conditioning, or even tune the radio without taking their eyes off the 
road. This type of readout, known as a "head-up display," has been used on jet 
fighters for over 30 years, and is claimed to make the operation of supersonic 
aircraft safer by allowing pilots to check their instruments while still 
watching where they are going. 
</P>
<P>
People who have tested AutoVision say the matchbook-size mirror blocks far less 
of the windshield than the sun visor and is no more distracting than the 
overhead signs on a highway. However, the real magic of this invention may be 
the fact that it concentrates driver attention on the road ahead. "The view of 
the road surrounding the television image always remains in focus," the 
inventor said, "and a driver whose interest is captured by what is going on in 
front of the car is not likely to let his eyes wander off the road." 
</P>
<P>
The panel of independent psychologists and traffic safety specialists now 
evaluating the device for AutoVision generally agree that there is little 
danger in having the mirror on the windshield. However, some members of the 
group have stressed the need for further research on what images should be 
shown and under what conditions the device should be used. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have no objection to using this device to display a picture of the 
dashboard," said Dr. Herschel Leibowitz, an experimental psychologist at 
Pennsylvania State University, who has tested AutoVision. "I can even see how 
the television function might be beneficial in stimulating drivers who are 
bored and in danger of falling asleep. However, misuse might be dangerous, 
especially if the driver was drinking, or was distracted in heavy traffic or 
with pedestrians present." 
</P>
<P>
The objection that watching television while driving will distract drivers and 
delay their reactions is the most common criticism of AutoVision. But Schiffman 
said, "We have been testing AutoVision for several years, and over 200 people 
have driven the prototype cars a total of 175,000 miles without a single 
incident. Our experience and research have shown that when a person watching 
AutoVision sees a potential hazard in the same visual area as the screen, he 
automatically shifts his attention to the problem. The first call of mankind is 
to preserve its own skin. It is a natural reaction." 
</P>
<P>
A driver can watch AutoVision and drive at the same time because most of the 
information needed to follow a television program comes from the audio portion 
of the broadcast. "You do a sort of time sharing, and actually look at the 
screen only a small fraction of the time," explains the inventor. "But even 
when you glance at the picture to fill in some details, everything on the road 
ahead remains in full view and completely in focus." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for AutoVision first came to Schiffman while he was doing research on 
head-up display units designed for aircraft. In order to discover how these 
displays might be distracting to pilots, he installed one in a panel truck and 
began driving with it. "The electronics for that first unit took up almost the 
entire back of the truck, and while the research I wanted to do was never 
funded, I did discover that if I put the right type of image in the right 
location, I could safely drive while watching television." 
</P>
<P>
As his work progressed, and with the advent of transistors and printed 
circuits, Schiffman reduced the dimensions of the projection unit to the size 
of a book. 
</P>
<P>
He also developed other types of head-up displays, such as the Bendix Blind 
Landing System (to which he holds the patent), a device that allows pilots 
flying in fog to see an electronically generated image of the runway they are 
approaching. But even with this impressive background, he had to work at 
convincing scientists, traffic officials and investors that his invention was 
practical. "Most of them found the idea of AutoVision hard to believe, but when 
I got them in a car and let them drive with it, they immediately saw its 
possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Schiffman believes that the story of AutoVision could very well parallel that 
of the car radio. In 1929, Bill Lear (later of jet aircraft fame) presented his 
boss, Paul Galvin, with the first radio designed for use in an automobile. 
Galvin's immediate response was, "They'll never be allowed in cars. There will 
be laws against them." But Lear was determined, and despite predictions from 
traffic authorities in Washington that there would be nationwide bans on car 
radios, his invention was a success and formed the basis of what would later 
become the Motorola Corp. Some cities actually did pass laws against using 
radios while driving, but every one of these laws was eventually repealed, and 
today 95% of all cars are equipped with a radio. 
</P>
<P>
With 300 million motor vehicles now operating worldwide and 30 million new cars 
being built each year, the economic possibilities for AutoVision are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
"If the safety issues are resolved, the market for AutoVision should be similar 
to the one for car stereo systems," said Ron Pherigo of the American 
Electronics Assn. But others fear that this is another multibillion-dollar 
industry that could be lost if the fear of liability suits forces the 
technology overseas, to Europe or Japan, where few laws exist that would limit 
the use of the device. 
</P>
<P>
The safety consultants and traffic officials who have begun to evaluate 
AutoVision believe that some form of the apparatus could be used in cars in the 
near future. But no one is sure exactly what we will see when we look at that 
tiny screen. Some recommend that video cameras be used to televise the blind 
spots between a car's mirrors, while others suggest that maps could be 
projected on the screen and the car's location plotted by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
"I can imagine it being used as an entertainment device, but with carefully 
defined programming," said Prof. D. Alfred Owens, a psychologist specializing 
in human perception and traffic safety at Franklin and Marshall College. "This 
device provides an opportunity to develop an entirely new mode of broadcasting 
that considers the driver's situation and actually enhances driver attention." 
</P>
<P>
If the television option is proved safe for widespread use, proponents say, 
AutoVision will change the way we experience driving. It can make extended 
trips seem shorter, calm people caught in traffic jams and even keep drivers 
alert during long, boring trips. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we need to know about this device can be researched," Owens said. 
"In fact, if you will pardon the pun, this new technology is going to drive us 
to learn more about how humans operate automobiles."

A new test appears effective at identifying early breast cancer patients at 
greatest risk for suffering a life-threatening recurrence of the disease, 
researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said last week. In 
a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers 
reported that breast cancer patients who test positively for a protein called 
Hpr have nearly four times the chances that their cancer will come back, 
indicating that they may be candidates for the strongest cancer-fighting drugs 
initially. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers tested cancer tissue samples from 70 women diagnosed with Stage 
1 and Stage 2 breast cancer from 1977 through 1985. Those who tested positively 
for Hpr had nearly four times the risk of suffering a recurrence compared to 
those who did not in the 11 years after diagnosis, the researchers found. 
Although they are not sure how Hpr, or haptoglobin-related protein, would 
influence the chances of having a recurrence, scientists suspect that the 
protein may play a role in the cancer's ability to spread. From staff and wire

Menopause appears to increase the risk of heart disease for women by causing 
harmful changes in their cholesterol levels, researchers at UC San Diego 
reported last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers tested 541 healthy women before they went through menopause in 
1983 and 1984 for a variety of factors believed associated with an increased 
risk for heart disease. When they later compared the 69 women who went through 
menopause in the next 2 1/2 years to those who did not, the menopausal women 
had about twice the increase in their blood levels of low-density lipoprotein. 
LDL is known as "bad cholesterol" because it tends to accumulate inside artery 
walls, setting the stage for heart attacks. The menopausal women also had a 
significant drop in their levels of high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, a form of 
cholesterol thought to help reduce LDL levels. 
</P>

Women usually go through menopause in their 50s, when their ovaries stop 
producing the female hormone estrogen. From staff and wire reports

CATARACTS LINKED TO SMOKING

Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute have found that men who 
quit smoking 10 or more years ago have half the risk of smokers of developing 
the most common type of cataracts, a condition in which the lens of the eye 
becomes cloudy and later opaque when proteins inside the cells of the eye's 
lens undergo structural change. By age 70, most people have some evidence of 
nuclear cataracts, which form in the center of the lens. 
</P>
<P>
"The mechanism by which smoking might damage the lens nucleus is unclear," said 
Dr. Sheila K. West, the study's principal investigator. "Among the 
possibilities is the damage from toxic byproducts in cigarette smoke. The 
reduced cataract risk among the men who stopped smoking suggests that damage to 
the lens may be reversible." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, cataracts have been related solely to aging, and most 
ophthalmologists believed that nothing could be done to alter the cataract's 
course. From staff and wire reports

SHOTGUNS, DRUGS FOUND ON VISITORS TO JAIL; 11 ARRESTED

<P>
An intensive search operation by sheriff's deputies at an East Los Angeles jail 
Saturday night ended with the arrests of 11 people who carried in concealed 
shotguns, pistols, drugs and narcotics paraphernalia during visits with 
inmates, department officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Terry Judge said that nine men and two boys were arrested in the spot 
crackdown at the Biscailuz Center conducted by the sheriff's Special 
Enforcement Bureau. He said that two shotguns, two pistols and "miscellaneous 
amounts" of rock cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine and alcohol were 
confiscated. The 11 suspects were not identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
"Why anybody would bring a shotgun or drugs when visiting someone in jail is 
beyond me," Judge said, "but for anybody to bring any contraband in is not a 
wise move." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Felony Offenses 
</P>
<P>
Felony charges will be filed against the 11 individuals, according to 
department officials. Warnings posted at county jails advise that it is a 
felony to bring in firearms, drugs or alcohol and that visitors are subject to 
search. 
</P>
<P>
Judge said there was no specific reason that the medium-security jail at 1060 
N. Eastern Ave. was the target of the Special Enforcement Bureau during the 
6-to-7-p.m. visiting hour. "It was just a random thing that they do at 
facilities where visitors have contact with the inmates," he said, adding that 
it was not known whether any of those arrested was suspected of gang 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing at the jail to make us believe that there was anything out 
of the ordinary," Judge said. "The only speculation, as to why anybody would 
try to bring a shotgun or a pistol in a jail, is that maybe they were trying to 
pass it on to a gang member or someone who felt that they needed protection. 
But we don't know if the was the case here. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason that there was so much contraband confiscated may just have had to 
do with more deputies than usual on hand to do the searches. But I'm not at all 
surprised to see so much stuff confiscated, when you consider that we have more 
than 20,000 inmates in our system, and so many people visiting them."

season reach for the Redskins, 10 to 12 victories. Their edge in slipping by 
the Eagles and Giants for the NFC East title just might be the dreaded s-word, 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
For being three games better than the Redskins and winning the division 
championship last season, the Eagles drew a 1989 schedule that includes games 
with the 49ers and the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's NFC West opponent is Atlanta; its comparable NFC Central opponent 
is Tampa Bay. Philadelphia plays the Bears and Broncos on the road during the 
regular season; Washington gets both of them here. The Giants avoid the Bears, 
but get the Vikings (at home) and the 49ers and Rams (away). 
</P>
<P>
Coach Joe Gibbs surely has reminded his troops no more than 50,000 times about 
opening -- and sort of closing -- 1988 with that Monday Fright against the 
Giants. And that the Giants also were three games better during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Lots went wrong for the Redskins in their first losing season under Gibbs; 
nothing was more vexing than surrendering touchdowns on a blocked punt and a 
Doug Williams fumble in the fourth quarter at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs spent first- and second-round draft choices to acquire a big-time 
thumper, Gerald Riggs, then spent months in closed-door think sessions on how 
often to run him left, right or up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
What Gibbs may have done best is keep Riggs fairly close to him on the 
sidelines during the preseason. Those 6,631 yards in 1,587 carries over seven 
seasons with the Falcons are proof that Riggs can crash the nastiest crowd. No 
sense risking an injury against giants when Giants await. 
</P>
<P>
Even though they call themselves New York but never play there, the Giants are 
no dunces. Knowing Gibbs would like to run Riggs their way every chance 
possible, they surely will offer a defense that forces Mark Rypien to beat 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Rypien has been an easy mark throughout an off-season in which few NFL players 
actually were allowed off. Too good to be believed during many stretches of 
last year, too lousy to be tolerated during others, Rypien in his second season 
wants blissful consistency. 
</P>
<P>
The first commandment for quarterbacks working for Gibbs is: Thou shalt not 
lose football games. No dumb throws. Know the difference between a Posse and a 
posse. If your friends have no chance to catch the ball, make certain nobody 
does. 
</P>
<P>
Probably, the biggest rooter for the Redskins' offense is the Redskins' 
defense. It would like to be heroic, making spectacular plays and strutting 
week after week. That didn't happen a year ago and might not again. 
</P>
<P>
While the Redskins were intercepting just 14 passes, their opponents were 
swiping 25. The other fellows lost eight fumbles a year ago, the Redskins 21. 
Maybe the stat that clinched the Riggs deal with Atlanta was opponents scoring 
twice as many rushing touchdowns (17 to eight). 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins were fortunate Willard Reaves still was available when rookie Joe 
Mickles went down last week. Why anyone, even a football fossil of 30, who 
produces touchdowns near the goal line stays unemployed in the NFL for more 
than 30 seconds remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Decades go by, an obscure offensive-minded coach shortly follows a famous 
defensive-obsessed coach and one thing stays fairly constant: Washington's 
middle linebacker will get cut one week and start the regular season there the 
next. Somewhere, lumpy Mo Pottios had a chuckle reading about Neal Olkewicz.

BECKER BOUNCES LENDL TO WIN HIS FIRST U.S. OPEN

Boris Becker of West Germany won his first U.S. Open on Sunday, staking claim 
to the world's No. 1 ranking by beating top-seeded Ivan Lendl, 7-6, 1-6, 6-3, 
7-6. 
</P>
<P>
In blistering heat that had Becker frequently icing his legs and eating fruit 
during breaks, the second seed from West Germany took his fourth Grand Slam 
title. He won his third Wimbledon crown in July. 
</P>
<P>
Becker's double success won't be enough to lift him past Lendl in the computer 
rankings. But his strong serve and improved court command were enough to 
outlast the three-time Open champion in the 3-hour, 51-minute battle in 
temperatures that reached 110 degrees on the court. 
</P>
<P>
For Lendl, it was a second straight long and disappointing Open final. After 
winning three straight titles from 1985-87, Lendl lost in five sets to Mats 
Wilander last year, surrendering the top ranking that he soon recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, 21, now has won four consecutive meetings with the 29-year-old Lendl. 
They are 7-7 lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Becker's win gave West Germany a sweep of the singles championships at 
Wimbledon and the Open. Steffi Graf also won both. 
</P>
<P>
It was Becker's first Grand Slam final anywhere but Wimbledon. His best 
previous showing at the Open was the semifinals in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl tied an Open record with his eighth consecutive final, something Bill 
Tilden did from 1918-25. The Czech, who now lives in Greenwich, Conn., less 
than an hour from the National Tennis Center, lost to Jimmy Connors twice, John 
McEnroe once and Wilander in previous Open finals. 
</P>
<P>
Becker won $300,000, while Lendl earned $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
After Becker took a 5-0 lead in the the first-set tiebreaker and won 7-2, Lendl 
easily took the second set. But Becker got a decisive break in the eighth game 
of the third set -- just after Lendl had broken his serve -- to take a two sets 
to one lead. 
</P>
<P>
Becker was up a break point in the fourth set, but couldn't hold serve in the 
eighth game. They went to another tiebreaker, which Becker won on a service 
winner 7-4 after losing the first two points. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who had 11 aces and 11 double-faults, became the first German to win 
the American championship. With a section of fans shouting, "Boris, Boris," 
Becker stood at the baseline with his hands raised high after winning the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
The West German nearly was out of the tournament in the second round. He was 
down two match points to Derrick Rostagno, but rallied to win with the help of 
a timely netcord. 
</P>
<P>
Against Lendl, Becker grabbed a 3-0 lead, holding serve in a nine-minute game 
before breaking Lendl in another long game. Lendl double-faulted on break 
point. 
</P>
<P>
But Lendl came right back, winning the next three games and holding two break 
points in the seventh game. Becker saved those and a service winner gave him a 
4-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
They each held serve into the tiebreaker, which Becker dominated. He won the 
first five points, Lendl took two, then a pair of nice cross-court backhands 
clinched the 76-minute set for Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl broke in the fourth and sixth games to easily take the second set in 28 
minutes, but Becker won the first three games of the third set. Already 
bleeding mildly on the right leg from an earlier spill, Becker also began icing 
his legs early in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl came back in the seventh game as Becker hit several sloppy approach 
shots. Becker responded with another break, then held a set point, which Lendl 
saved with a forehand passing shot. Becker set up another set point with his 
ninth ace and a service winner ended the 43-minute set. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing two sets to one, Lendl immediately broke serve, only to see Becker 
come right back to win the game with superb net play. 
</P>
<P>
Becker then won the next three games, but Lendl surged back, breaking in the 
eighth game with two terrific backhand passes to even the set at 4-4. They held 
serve into the final tiebreaker.

WEST GERMAN DROPS LENDL IN FOUR-SET FINAL

<P>
In the fourth set, in the final tiebreaker, on the last day of the U.S. Open, 
Boris Becker stood at the service line and did something odd. 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Here was the sort of pressure that could unnerve the strongest of psyches and 
Becker decided to smile, of all things, as if he had a secret on the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something you can't explain," said Becker of West Germany. "It's 
something coming up inside of you. What it is is believing in yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Two points away from his second Grand Slam title in two months, Becker sent two 
high-speed serves at Ivan Lendl, who glared hollow-eyed across the net. 
</P>
<P>
Becker's first was an ace. He needed one more. 
</P>
<P>
So as his second serve blew down the middle and bounced aimlessly off Lendl's 
racket, Boris Becker made believers out of everybody once again. 
</P>
<P>
Becker completed a rare double-slam Sunday as the Wimbledon champion also 
became the U.S. Open champion when he defeated Lendl, 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 
(7-4) in 3 hours 51 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In a matchup of the world's two best players, Becker was better. His fourth 
Grand Slam title, but his first outside of Wimbledon, came at the expense of 
No. 1-ranked Lendl, who lost his fifth Open final Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite unbelievable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S Open champion on three occasions, Lendl has lost the final five times and 
this one may have been the toughest to take because he was so helpless at 
exactly the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl pointed to the fourth set tiebreaker and what Becker did the final two 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"Tiebreakers are usually a shootout, but with a serve like his . . . he hit two 
great serves," Lendl said. "There is not much that you can do about it. I don't 
know what to say." 
</P>
<P>
Becker's serve was particularly eloquent, especially at critical moments. He 
had 11 aces, including one at game point to even the fourth set at 6-6 and send 
the match into the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the first-set tiebreaker, Becker fell behind quickly. Lendl led, 2-0, on 
two Becker errors, but allowed him to tie with a lob that sailed long and a 
crucial double fault. 
</P>
<P>
At 3-2, Becker's first volley drove Lendl deep to his backhand in the far 
corner and then he put away the return with a backhand volley winner. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl hit out from the baseline and his forehand was long for 5-3, so when 
Becker carelessly dropped a backhand into the net, it was with the knowledge he 
had the next two serves and the end of the match was totally within his power. 
</P>
<P>
That is why Becker smiled. He stood with one foot close to the baseline, one 
directly behind and rocked from one to the other. 
</P>
<P>
Within seconds, it was over. As the ball dribbled away from Lendl, Becker threw 
both arms into the air and stood motionless for several seconds, a red-headed 
statue. 
</P>
<P>
Just as he had done when he defeated Stefan Edberg to win at Wimbledon, Becker 
heaved his dark blue and red racket into the stands. After shaking hands with 
Lendl, Becker was soon holding the silver U.S. Open championship trophy aloft. 
</P>
<P>
Standing to one side, what must Lendl have been thinking? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the first-set tiebreaker, which he lost after falling behind, 5-0. 
It could have been the third set when he broke Becker, then had a key 
double-fault to lose his own serve at love and miss his chance to even the set. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly Lendl was thinking about the kind of player Becker has become, a rival 
to his own No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously top players have something more than the others and they win a lot 
of matches because they come up with better shots than anybody else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tracing Becker's thought was simpler. He remembered the shot that saved him 
from losing in the second round, the one on match point that hit the net cord 
and bounced away from Derrick Rostagno, who was waiting to hit a simple volley 
that would have beaten Becker. 
</P>
<P>
"To win a Grand Slam, you have to once come from a match where you are almost 
out of the tournament," said Becker, who earned $300,000 for the victory. "All 
the time it's like that, at least for me. 
</P>
<P>
"So I knew after I survived that match that things could only get better for 
me, not worse. It made me calmer." 
</P>
<P>
It did not make him No. 1, however. Even though Lendl's lost, he retained his 
top ranking over Becker by six computer points. 
</P>
<P>
Becker lost in the second round of the Australian Open, but then made the 
semifinals at the French Open and won Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl won in Australia, lost in the fourth round of the French Open, the 
semifinal at Wimbledon and now the final at the U.S. Open. Even Lendl admitted 
that he and Becker are close to equal. 
</P>
<P>
"Boris and I have been playing well throughout the year and the other players 
have had ups and down," Lendl said. "I don't know if you can call it two No. 1s 
or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl was asked if Becker is the No. 1 player this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a very good case for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there was not much separating Becker and Lendl on this humid 
September Sunday. They won exactly the same number of points, 143. They both 
committed 43 unforced errors. Becker held 14 service games, Lendl held 15. 
</P>
<P>
But if there is a lasting memory at the 109th U.S. Open, it is Boris Becker 
standing there at the service line with a smile on his face. 
</P>
<P>
It was a Grand Slam smile.

Martina Navratilova, who won 19 Grand Slam doubles titles with Pam Shriver as a 
partner, teamed with Hana Mandlikova to take the U.S. Open women's doubles 
title Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova and Mandlikova beat Shriver and Mary Jo Fernandez, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4. 
Navratilova and Shriver split last month. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had one of the greatest partnerships of all time together," said 
Navratilova, who is expected to team with Shriver next month in the Federation 
Cup. "I don't know if I'll commit to anybody for a full year. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling that the crowd felt I had wronged Pam, that it was my fault. 
Everything I did was above board." 
</P>
<P>
Shriver and Fernandez never had played together and became a team just moments 
before the entry deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"If this was a marriage, I'd call it a trial separation," Navratilova said 
early last week. "I thought Pam needed time to sort out her career. She was so 
scattered." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shriver: "Our schedules didn't work out well this year. It was also at a 
time I was questioning my dedication. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it was a time she thought she would give me a kick in my pants, three 
weeks before the Open. But I understand it because, besides friendship, it's a 
business and a partnership." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova and Mandlikova blew three match points before clinching the title 
on Navratilova's overhead. 
</P>
<P>
For Mandlikova, who has won four Grand Slam singles titles, it was her first 
major doubles victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning with Martina is a great honor," Mandlikova said. "I enjoyed it. As to 
the future, it is up to her, not me. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt something was going on between Pam and Martina and that I needed to 
prove something. Then, on one of the changeovers, I said, 'I don't need to 
prove anything. Just win the match.' "

WORLD CUP TRACK AND FIELD MEET; 
</P>
<P>
KINGDOM'S 12.87 IS WIND-AIDED 
</P>

When Roger Kingdom saw his world-record time on the scoreboard after he won the 
World Cup 110-meter hurdles Sunday night, he could not believe it. Then, he 
could. Near the end of his victory lap, he discovered that he was right the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
After running the high hurdles in 12.92 seconds earlier this summer to break 
Renaldo Nehemiah's eight-year-old record, Kingdom bettered that at Montjuic 
Olympic Stadium with a 12.87. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, no," Kingdom said as he looked at the time flashing on the scoreboard. 
"Not twice in one season." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, yes," Spanish hurdler Javier Moracho said as he congratulated Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Moracho was wrong both times. As he and runner-up Colin Jackson of Great 
Britain jogged down the backstretch side by side on their victory lap, Jackson 
pointed to the wind gauge, which registered a plus 2.51 meters per second for 
the race. The allowable tail wind for record consideration is 2.0. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping it was for another race," Kingdom said of the wind reading. "But, 
unfortunately, they called out that it was for ours. It was very disappointing. 
When the gun fired, the wind was in our faces." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was the fastest time ever recorded in the event under all conditions. 
The previous best was the 12.91 that Nehemiah ran 10 years ago with a 3.5 
meter-per-second wind at his back. In finishing second Sunday night, Jackson 
ran 12.95, the fifth-fastest time under all conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the prevailing wind, Kingdom's time was remarkable considering that 
only minutes before the track looked like a moat. 
</P>
<P>
A sudden, heavy downpour caused a two-hour delay in the meet and caused about 
half of the 43,574 who bought tickets to find something else to do, presumably 
indoors. There was even talk of canceling the final session of the three-day 
competition, until the rain suddenly subsided. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a superb job by the squeegee patrol, the track was still so wet when 
the hurdlers were called to the starting line that Poland's Thomaaz Nagorka 
took one look and decided to return to the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
"He was on the track and decided not to run," said U.S. Coach Harry Groves of 
Penn State. "I talked to his coach afterward, and he was banging his head 
against the wall." 
</P>
<P>
That was the coach of the European all-stars, who entered that race tied with 
the United States for first place in the men's standings. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking its third title in five World Cups, the United States earned nine 
points from Kingdom's first-place finish. Europe expected as many as six from 
Nagorka and instead got none because he scratched. So much for solidarity from 
the Pole. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans never overcame the deficit, although a victory by Sweden's Patrik 
Sjoberg in the high jump with a meet record 7-feet 8-inches brought them within 
two points entering the final event, the 1,600-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was second in that race to finish with 133 points. The 
Europeans were a distant sixth in the relay and finished with 127 points. Great 
Britain scored 119 points for third place. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't look real glamorous at the end," said Groves, who could count only 
five first-place finishes in 20 events among his team's points. "But we did 
what we came to do." 
</P>
<P>
The East German women won their fourth consecutive World Cup championship with 
124 points, easily beating the 116 scored by the second-place Soviet Union. 
With only two first-places in 16 events, the United States finished fifth with 
84.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States had a courageous effort Sunday night in the 3,000 from 
PattiSue Plumer. With little more than a lap remaining, she clipped the heels 
of Soviet Tatiana Pozdnyakova and went sprawling. When she did, East German 
Ellen Kiessling tripped over her and also fell. 
</P>
<P>
Pozdnyakova ran ahead in a futile attempt to catch the eventual winner, Great 
Britain's Yvonne Murray. Kiessling got back on her feet first and soon was 
challenging Kenyan Helen Kimayio for third place. 
</P>
<P>
But entering the stretch, running with a strained left knee suffered in the 
collision, Plumer began to gain on them. In the final 10 meters, she edged 
ahead of Kiessling for third place. 
</P>
<P>
The meet's outstanding performer was Cuba's Ana Quirot, who anchored the 
Americas all-stars to first place in the 1,600-meter relay Friday and added an 
individual gold in the 800 meters Saturday with the third-fastest time ever. 
</P>
<P>
Finally running out of energy, she was overtaken in the stretch of Sunday 
night's 400 meters by France's Marie-Jose Perec. Perec crossed the finish line 
in 50.30, Quirot in 50.60. But Perec later was disqualified for running out of 
her lane, giving Quirot her third gold. 
</P>
<P>
With the world's fastest time in 1989 in the 400 and the 800, Quirot, 26, has a 
good chance to be named woman athlete of the year.

ARCHITECTURE: CERRITOS ARTS CENTER: A FLEXIBLE PROTOTYPE FOR SMALL CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When the Cerritos Community Arts Center opens in 1992, its main theater will be 
a miracle of technological versatility and ingenuity. In the auditorium, banks 
of seating "wagons" that float on jets of air like Hovercraft can be moved 
manually to create a series of different shapes for a wide variety of events. 
The stage and its proscenium will be able to shift forward and backward to 
provide large or small performance spaces. The theater's dropped orchestra 
floor and pit will rise flush with the stage to make room for a banqueting 
hall. Thus the auditorium can become a 1,750-seat concert hall, or transform 
itself into a smaller arena with a central stage for theater-in-the-round, 
wrestling matches or fashion shows. 
</P>
<P>
"In the new center we will have the most flexible space the mind of man can 
dream up," said Cerritos Mayor Diana Needham. "Every possible community event 
will be accommodated whether intimate or grand." 
</P>
<P>
The $40-million Community Arts Center, designed by Hollywood-based Barton Myers 
Associates, got the go-ahead from the City Council last month. The Arts Center 
is planned as part of the city's 125-acre Towne Center development opposite 
City Hall, which will include office and retail space, and a luxury hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the theater, the Arts Center plan includes a large community meeting 
room that can be divided up into six smaller spaces with movable partitions. 
This meeting room can also serve as an intimate chamber music concert hall or 
small auditorium for public lectures. An Actors Building with dressing and prop 
rooms opens onto an Actors Garden for outdoor performances. A walled Poets 
Garden for quiet contemplation completes the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We can program an incredible range of happenings in this building," said Arts 
Center manager Phill Lipman. "The Miss Cerritos Pageant, Broadway plays and 
Wagnerian operas, symphony concerts and mud wrestling, bar mitzvahs and 
communion parties -- all can be made to feel at home." Lipman also envisages a 
community outreach program that will take plays and concerts out into the 
schools, "to nurture our future audiences." He sees a variety of workshops and 
master classes for the city's budding actors and musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"The Arts Center will be the prototype for the Southland's smaller cities," 
architect Myers said. "The design demonstrates how a town the size of Cerritos, 
with fewer than 60,000 people, can afford to build and operate a multipurpose 
facility in scale with its architecture and its aspirations." 
</P>
<P>
The pivot of the design is the dramatic glass-walled grand lobby -- a 
five-story theatrical space in its own right. The arts center's exterior, clad 
in red granite with bands of gray limestone, is enlivened by perky pyramids 
covered in colored tile. Flagpole finials flouting banners add the air of a 
circus or carnival to the Postmodern Mediterranean-style composition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lively and Dynamic' 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we felt that the architecture of the center had to be lively and 
dynamic, to create a focus in what is in effect a giant car park," Myers said. 
"It has to generate a powerful feeling of warmth, energy and light to establish 
its own vivid personality among the rather bland buildings and blank spaces 
that surround it." 
</P>
<P>
Known more for its Auto Square off the San Gabriel River Freeway than its 
cultural heritage, Cerritos is, like many smaller Southland communities, on the 
verge of a new urban sophistication. Cerritos -- originally incorporated in 
1956 as Dairy Valley, changed to Cerritos ("Little Hills" in Spanish) in 1967 
-- is a mildly prosperous city with a mixed population of whites, blacks, 
Latinos and Asians. Median annual family income is around $32,000 and the 
average price of a home is less than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council began to consider the need for more community meeting and 
cultural facilities in the early 1980s. A staff report recommending a 
fixed-seat auditorium for 2,000 people was rejected as inflexible and difficult 
to support financially, given the competition from neighboring cultural centers 
in Costa Mesa, La Mirada and Downey. 
</P>
<P>
While the council was puzzling over this problem it heard about an innovative, 
highly flexible community theater at Derngate, in Northampton, England. Built 
in 1984 by Theatre Projects Consultants, Derngate developed the movable seating 
wagons floating on manually operated air casters that allow a variety of 
layouts within the same space. "Like all elegant solutions, (Derngate) is 
simple," wrote Francis Reid in the British Architects' Journal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competition for Design 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Needham visited Derngate and was so impressed she had the City Council 
hire Theatre Projects Consultants to do a study for Cerritos. The city held a 
limited design competition based on the TPC study, which Barton Myers 
Associates won. 
</P>
<P>
"We chose BMA because of their experience in designing community theaters in 
Portland, Ore., and Edmonton, Alberta," Needham said. "While neither of these 
facilities is as flexible as ours will be, we liked their approach, and their 
understanding of the scale and character such a cultural complex needs." 
</P>
<P>
Though Needham and Lipman acknowledge that the arts seldom make a profit, 
Lipman, an experienced arts manager, hopes that by providing a mixture of 
culture and entertainment, from the popular to the elitist, the Arts Center 
will function with a minimum of municipal subsidy, possibly less than $250,000 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the center will be provided by the Cerritos Redevelopment Agency, 
raised mostly by tax-increment levies imposed on commercial development in the 
new Towne Center. "Culture adds value to commerce," Needham said, "apart from 
its intrinsic worth. As Cerritos matures from a bedroom community created out 
of an old dairy farm into a real city with its own true heart, the arts are a 
landmark in our coming of age."

Ashland Reaches Agreement With Iran: Ashland Oil Inc. agreed to pay Iran $325 
million to settle a 10-year-old dispute over an oil bill and Iranian breach of 
contract, the company announced. The Ashland, Ky., company had refused to pay 
Iran for $283 million in crude oil delivered 10 years ago because of losses 
that it said it suffered as a result of 1979 breaches of contract by National 
Iranian Oil Co.

Grand Jury Investigates Proxy Firm: A New York state grand jury is conducting a 
criminal fraud investigation into the billing practices at the Carter 
Organization, one of three companies that dominate the business of proxy 
solicitation for takeover fights, the New York Times reported. The Times said 
state prosecutors believe that the firm billed clients for millions of dollars 
in bogus expenses. But Carter representatives reportedly told investigators 
that the expenses are proper if the cost of overhead is included. The 
investigation is also examining whether Donald C. Carter, head of the firm, 
charged personal expenses to the company, the Times said.

China Expected to Resume GAAT Talks: China is expected to resume efforts soon 
to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT's director-general 
said. Arthur Dunkel of Switzerland said that officials from China, whose 
application for GATT membership was temporarily shelved after the bloody 
crackdown on student-led protests in June, plan to hold discussions with GATT 
members about reviving talks on membership. China applied in 1986 to join GATT, 
a 96-nation market-oriented group whose members pledge to bring their policies 
in line with its free-trade rules.

BUSH ADVANCED COMPUTER PLAN COULD BOOST STATE INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's high-tech industries and researchers will get a big boost from a 
Bush Administration plan to spend $1.9 billion over five years on advanced 
computer technology, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
White House science adviser D. Allan Bromley released a report Sunday by the 
White House Office of Science and Technology proposing the program to promote 
advanced computing capabilities, including the creation of a fiber-optic 
network linking the nation's supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would not just fund more research, but would also try to better 
coordinate government, educational and industry development of computers and 
computer programs. 
</P>
<P>
It envisions establishing a National Research and Education Network to transmit 
data between supercomputers at speeds of up to 3 gigabits -- 3 billion bits -- 
per second, or 2,000 times faster than current computer networks. Ultimately, 
the network would link homes and businesses throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Information Flow 
</P>
<P>
That would make it easier for California's computer-chip designers to get 
prototypes made, seismic scientists to analyze earthquake data, aerospace 
manufacturers to manage the production of planes, and biotechnology companies 
to map genes, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
When the super-fast network becomes available to the home or business computer 
user, it will be like putting regular cars on the Indianapolis race track, said 
Henri Aebischer, Apple Computer's director of networking and communication 
product marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't go as fast as an Indy car, but they'll go a lot faster than usual," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, current technology doesn't allow moving images generated 
by a computer to be sent over telephone lines except very slowly. 
</P>
<P>
But with the fiber-optic technology envisioned by the government plan, far-off 
doctors will be able to review medical scanner pictures in real time, experts 
will examine plane crash scenes via remote cameras, and advertising agencies 
will let clients immediately review the latest ad, all on computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say you have a grandmother in Boston. Rather than flying there for her 
birthday you make a little film. She will hear a little ring or a bell and she 
will go to her computer and punch a button and see her grandchildren singing 
happy birthday," Aebischer said. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of possibility can mean big business for entrepreneurs, and for 
companies like Apple that build business computers. 
</P>
<P>
Charles L. Seitz, a professor of computer science at the California Institute 
of Technology in Pasadena and a frequent technology adviser to the federal 
government, welcomed the Bush strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of the modern scientific enterprise is already based . . . on these 
cooperative efforts," he said, noting that the super-fast network would augment 
an existing network, called Internet, which already has yielded great research 
and commercial benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The existing network sends information at about 1.5 million bits per second. 
</P>
<P>
"A decade ago there were 40 or 50 computers on the national network," Seitz 
said. "Then this just grew like Topsy. There are easily hundreds of thousands 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Seitz already uses the computer network when he designs advanced computer 
chips. He sends his plans electronically to the University of Southern 
California's Information Sciences Institute in Marina del Rey, where a 
computer-managed program gets them built. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Willard, a senior analyst at Dataquest Inc., a high-tech market 
research firm in San Jose, said the proposal will have special impact in 
California because there is so much high-tech industry in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the long-term effect for industry will be a technological trickle-down 
where people learn how to use these highly sophisticated systems, design the 
software, and that moves into industry, where it gets into the product 
development department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The results, Willard said, could range from the National Security Agency 
breaking codes faster to General Electric building a better light bulb.

HONG KONG DRAIN OF PROFESSIONALS IS GAINING SPEED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong's brain drain of people seeking the security of foreign passports and 
new ways of life abroad, before the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 
1997, is expected to rise by about 30% from 42,000 this year to 55,000 next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Recent events in China have seriously affected the confidence of Hong Kong 
people in the territory's freedom and prosperity after 1997. Thousands who said 
they had not previously planned to leave have approached local foreign 
consulates about possible emigration. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure has also increased on the United Kingdom to provide more than 3 
million people with the security of full British passports, which would boost 
confidence and could stem the brain drain. The United Kingdom government is 
expected to announce in the next few weeks how many passports it is prepared to 
issue, but the number will be far less than 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Was Much Lower 
</P>
<P>
The outflow of people will have a serious impact on Hong Kong's businesses, 
which have managed so far to cope with the loss of mostly younger professional 
and skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
New estimates released last week by the Hong Kong government show that last 
year's total of 45,800 is expected to drop to a previously forecast level of 
42,000 this year because there has not been enough time since the Beijing 
crisis for people to organize residence abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The total is then expected to rise to 55,000 in 1990. In the early and 
mid-1980s, the annual figure hovered around 20,000. About 90% of the total go 
to Canada, Australia and the United States. This proportion is not expected to 
change rapidly, despite recruiting efforts made recently by other countries, 
notably Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rowse, the official in charge of preparing the statistics, said last 
week that a new "equilibrium of around 55,000 to 60,000" was likely to be 
established. 
</P>
<P>
About 24% of the total emigrants are classified as professional, technical, 
administrative and managerial workers, who only make up 5.5% of the total 
population.

<P>
It was a week filled with contrasts: 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 29, a five-member South Korean delegation awarded a $2.36-million 
contract to Kolon California Corp. of Long Beach to export 700 metric tons of 
grain-fed American beef to the Asian nation. 
</P>
<P>
Seven days later, dozens of South Korean farmers marched in protest outside a 
Seoul hotel, demanding the cancellation of an American food fair that they 
contended signals the U.S. invasion of South Korea's agricultural market. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the protest, the fair went on, with more than 60 American companies -- 
at least half from California -- displaying products approved for export to 
South Korea. Items ranged from jelly, wine and prunes to microwave popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the South Korean government's recent decision to slowly open up its 
agricultural markets in a move to ease trade friction with the United States. 
Between now and 1991, the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry plans to 
remove restrictions on the import of 243 food items, including dairy products, 
duck meat and salmon. 
</P>
<P>
U. K. Kim, deputy director of the Korea Trade Center in Los Angeles, sees 
increased agricultural trade as a two-pronged problem: Keeping both the 
American government and the Korean farmer happy. 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. exports to Korea, particularly agricultural products, have been 
increasing remarkably in the past couple of years," said Kim, whose center is 
an arm of the South Korean government. "On the other hand, in Korea, some 20% 
of the households are still living on the agricultural industry. . . . They are 
very afraid that the influx of foreign -- particularly U.S. -- agricultural 
products will topple the Korean agricultural industry." 
</P>
<P>
South Korea purchased $2.25 billion in U.S. farm products in 1988, becoming 
America's second-largest agricultural customer after Japan. The volume is 
expected to increase 15% to 20% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
American beef is a major Korean import item and a rapidly growing one. 
According to Korea Trade &amp; Business magazine, South Korea imported $83.18 
million in American beef in the first four months of 1989, nearly double the 
$42.81 million imported in the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Gap Kim is one man who is taking full advantage of the increase in South Korean 
beef imports; he plans to feed the nation as much as possible. Kim is 
purchasing general manager for Kolon California Corp. in Long Beach, an export 
firm that predicts $120 million in sales for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"In Korea, the population is more than 40 million," Gap Kim said. "South Korea 
is five times smaller than California. The country lost its space for cattle 
farms. . . . We like to have beef every time we take food. And we like to buy 
more U.S. beef." 
</P>
<P>
Kolon California is a big part of the increase in South Korean beef importing. 
Its parent company -- Seoul-based Kolon Group -- plays a big part of South 
Korean business in general. It was founded in 1954 and has more than 3,000 
employees in nearly 25 overseas branches. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, the Livestock Product Marketing Organization -- a 
quasi-government body -- awarded Kolon California a bid for 3,667 metric tons 
of grain-fed frozen beef. 
</P>
<P>
"I sent out 199 40-foot refrigerator containers from Long Beach to South Korea 
-- Pusan and Seoul -- during March, April and May," Gap Kim said. "In July, I 
shipped out almost 18 metric tons of steak and veal to Pusan." 
</P>
<P>
This month and next, Kolon California shipping containers will again leave Long 
Beach for South Korea -- this time carrying 1,400 metric tons of beef, 
contracts awarded during August. Kolon won 66% of the contracts awarded during 
the Livestock Product Marketing Organization's recent Midwestern swing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the biggest shipper of beef from the United States to South Korea," Gap 
Kim said. "We've been getting support from Kansas and Nebraska, but we'd like 
to cover as many states as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, he said, Kolon California works with 15 U.S. meatpacking companies 
to ship beef to South Korea. But Gap Kim sees increased demand and plans to 
take advantage of that. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989, South Korea should import about 30,000 metric tons of beef," he said. 
"In 1990, they will import almost twice as much. . . . We'd like to develop a 
relationship between more U.S. packers and ourselves. And we'd like to invest 
in packing companies to develop our own products."

DAIMLER-BENZ GETS WEST GERMAN PERMISSION TO BUY MAJOR ARMS MAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BONN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government has cleared the way for giant auto maker Daimler-Benz AG to buy 
a major arms maker in what will create one of Europe's largest companies, 
overriding an antitrust panel veto of the merger that's been dubbed the 
"elephants' wedding." 
</P>
<P>
Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann told a news conference Friday that he had 
agreed to endorse Daimler's $859-million bid to take over the 
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH aerospace and technology firm with certain 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
His approval came despite a veto from the Cartel Office, an independent 
governmental advisory board, which had rejected the merger of the nation's 
largest enterprise, Daimler-Benz, with the MBB firm that already controls a big 
share of the arms, technology and aerospace business in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Cartel Office had argued that the combined firms would be so powerful that 
they would distort competition among key domestic industries. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover would create a corporation with sales of roughly $40 billion 
annually, or the third-largest industrial concern in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost among the stipulations attached by Haussmann was that Daimler-MBB 
accelerate its plan to assume the West German government's share of the 
troubled European Airbus Industrie consortium. 
</P>
<P>
Daimler-MBB will have to take over Bonn's 37% share of Airbus by Dec. 31, 1996 
-- three years earlier than the corporations had proposed, Haussmann said. 
</P>
<P>
He contended that about $2.5 billion would be saved by the Bonn government by 
the year 2000 if it divested itself of Airbus participation and that trade 
relations with the United States could benefit as well. 
</P>
<P>
"This would also put us on the road to resolving one of the issues raised by 
the United States" in discussion of West German-U.S. trade relations, Haussmann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
West German subsidies for Airbus have been criticized by American aviation 
giants such as Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., which say that they 
provide an unfair competitive advantage for the European aircraft manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Without conceding that point, Haussmann said the Daimler-MBB merger would allow 
him to clear away a source of contention before negotiations scheduled here 
later this month with U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Daimler, which produces the luxury Mercedes automobile line, must approve the 
conditions outlined by Haussmann, but its endorsement is expected to be 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Haussmann said the Cartel Office fears of creating a defense industry monopoly 
were outweighed by "considerable economic advantages" that would stem from the 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Besides reducing government losses from the Airbus venture, Haussmann said the 
takeover would consolidate specialized expertise in the aerospace industry, 
giving West Germany a better competitive profile on the international market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Sell Operations 
</P>
<P>
Antitrust officials had advised last month that if Bonn were to override the 
Cartel Office veto, it should force Daimler-MBB to reduce its defense 
operations to avoid giving the merged firms an insurmountable advantage in 
competition for government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Haussmann said that besides the Airbus risk assumption, the takeover was 
contingent on Daimler and MBB selling interests in several naval, missile 
technology and tank companies within a specified time, as well as ridding 
themselves of interests in firms that give the government procurement advice. 
</P>
<P>
West German media, which called the merger plan "the elephants' wedding," 
speculated earlier this week that Deutsche Bank AG, West Germany's largest 
bank, would also be required to reduce its 28% share holding in Daimler-Benz to 
ease fears of the bank gaining a dominant position in national industry. 
</P>
<P>
But Haussmann said the bank's participation could not be part of his official 
ruling.

SALE OF SMALL LABELS SHAKES UP RECORD INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vinyl album isn't the only tradition disappearing from the record business. 
</P>
<P>
If the estimated $500-million sale of Hollywood-based A&amp;M Records to 
Dutch-owned PolyGram Records goes through as expected, it will leave only 
Geffen Records as a major privately owned U. S. record company. 
</P>
<P>
This is a marked change from the early days of rock, when most of the music's 
founders -- from Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry to Little Richard and the Everly 
Brothers -- were introduced via small, independent labels. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not just independent labels being bought by majors these days. Majors 
are also being either gobbled up by or becoming part of larger conglomerates. 
CBS Records, the nation's largest record company, was bought last year by Sony, 
while Warner Bros. Records' parent company -- Warner Communications -- is 
merging with Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The question is what effect all this financial wheeling and dealing will have 
on the shape of the music industry: Will it lead to a conservative stance that 
rejects creative risk-taking or will it open the door to even more adventurous 
signings? 
</P>
<P>
Seymour Stein, the head of Warner Bros.' formerly independent Sire Records and 
a leader in the industry for two decades, is alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not talking about soft drinks and soda wars," Stein said, speaking from 
Sire's London office. "When I started in the business, there were record 
companies of importance in every major city. 
</P>
<P>
"Small record companies, independents, are the lifeblood of the business," 
added Stein, whose label has introduced such varied artists as Madonna, Talking 
Heads and the Pretenders. "It's where the new artists and trends tend to come 
from. . . . I think (the new mergers) are going to stifle creativity. I'm very 
frightened." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Green, who as president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and 
Sciences represents artists and composers, agreed that there are some things to 
be concerned about. "We've looked at both sides," he said. "The down side is 
obvious if you're a writer or creative person at one of these 
mega-consolidations. You could get lost in the shuffle." 
</P>
<P>
Most industry insiders, however, say that bigger is turning out to be better. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at several labels all say that being taken into the multinational 
fold has actually stimulated creativity and concern for music at their 
companies, with Stein's own Sire as an example of what's right with the music 
industry these days. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago, no one thought about distributing independent labels," said 
Bob Buziak, who took over as president of RCA Records in late 1986, just as the 
company was being sold by General Electric to the West German-based Bertelsmann 
Music Group (BMG). "Now I think it's going to be the future. The more 
viewpoints you can have attached to a large business, the more opportunities 
for success and for creativity you're going to have." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, just six huge corporations were responsible for more than 70% of the 
750 million records, tapes and compact discs sold in the United States, 
generating revenues of about $4 billion: Bertelsmann, Japan-based Sony, Dutch 
Philips, British Thorn/EMI and two U. S. companies, Warner Communications and 
MCA. And with the recent acquisition of Island Records, the apparently 
impending purchase of A&amp;M by Philips, and other labels (including Virgin) 
considered ripe for the conglomerate picking, that percentage is bound to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Take a look at this week's Billboard Top 100 albums: 74 of them are on labels 
owned and operated by those six conglomerates. And most of the rest are 
distributed by subsidiaries of those groups. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Stein, in an article he wrote first for Billboard and then rewrote 
for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, counted 39 independents and only two major 
companies that played a significant role in shaping the industry during the 
crucial post-World War II boom that carried into the '60s. Most of those 39, he 
bemoaned, are now either gone or part of a major label group. 
</P>
<P>
One of those key 39 was Atlantic Records, which in 1966 became a part of Warner 
7-Arts, now Warner Communications and soon to be Time Warner, which operates 
the Warner Elektra Atlantic distribution group. Ahmet Ertegun, who founded 
Atlantic in 1948 and is still its chairman, doesn't think there is anything to 
worry about in the current merger mania. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has really changed in the last 10 or 15 years," he said. "The 
companies that were sold to the majors were not companies that had a very large 
share of the market." 
</P>
<P>
That opinion jibed with the Wall Street perspective provided by Harold Vogel, 
entertainment industry analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York: "There 
aren't very many implications that are new. The industry has been consolidating 
for years. You're just seeing transfers of ownership rights. By adding 1% or 2% 
of the business to PolyGram by buying A&amp;M, you're not changing the 
business. And all these so-called independents were distributed through the 
majors anyhow." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Island up to now has been distributed by Atlantic, as is Virgin, while 
A&amp;M is distributed by BMG, which owns Arista as well as RCA. 
</P>
<P>
And distribution is the key to all the consolidation. By buying or working with 
a smaller company, a corporation like BMG or PolyGram (a division of Philips) 
acquires product to feed its massive distribution network. And by being part of 
that network, a smaller company gains in visibility, marketing power and 
ultimately cash flow from which to develop new artists. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Clark has seen both sides of the issue. In the early '80s, she worked at 
L.A.-based independent Slash Records before it had a distribution arrangement 
with Warner Bros. Today she manages several acts -- including Los Lobos, 
Violent Femmes and Bob Mould -- who record for labels that are distributed by 
major companies. 
</P>
<P>
"At a small label the resources are limited," she said. "At Slash, sometimes we 
didn't know if we could meet the payroll. The bottom line is cash flow for the 
independent labels, so artists who sell records can get paid for them and the 
labels can get paid for them. With the majors, at least you know you're going 
to collect the money, so from that standpoint it's better." 
</P>
<P>
The point, the executives say, is not so much how few companies control the 
industry but what their management philosophy is. According to RCA president 
Bob Buziak, the BMG purchase has been liberating, not stifling. 
</P>
<P>
"BMG believes in decentralized business procedures," he said. "Before, the 
accountants were like policemen. That changed quickly. The system was changed 
and I ended up with my own (autonomous) functions, a finance man who's part of 
the team rather than a policeman." 
</P>
<P>
The results, he said, speak for themselves. "For the 15 years prior to the sale 
. . . RCA was a rest home for failing superstars that had seen better days. Me 
having the ability to take the roster and cut it down to five artists and start 
over is the best thing that could happen. Now we're known for cutting-edge 
artists like Cowboy Junkies and Love and Rockets." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas D. Mottola, president of CBS Records, which was sold to Sony in 1988, 
said that Sony has allowed him the same freedom. "You have pure music 
executives running CBS Records now and we're not governed by any corporate 
philosophy, as we were in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sire's Stein agreed: "Warner Bros. approached me because I think they thought I 
had a handle on New Wave music, with Talking Heads and Ramones. But I don't 
think they came to me for market share." 
</P>
<P>
And it is expected that when and if the PolyGram purchases of Island and 
A&amp;M are finalized, the management of the smaller companies will remain 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine they would not have bought those companies without assuring 
continuity of management," said Atlantic's Ertegun. "A record company's value 
is its catalogue, its artist roster and its management. And the third is most 
important." 
</P>
<P>
A potential shakeout of creative managers is what Stein fears most. "You're 
going to lose people along the way, and some who stay are going to lose 
interest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recording academy president Michael Green shares that concern. "The way these 
administrations come and go at record companies, it's hard to get your finger 
on the pulse of a long-term strategy. Sometimes to these people long-term can 
mean the Christmas season."

THE NETWORKS' NEW SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
RETURNING SERIES HOPE BABIES WILL DELIVER THE RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN LINAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the memorable night in 1953 when Lucille Ball delivered Little Ricky and 
big ratings, networks have come to rely on births as a means of boosting their 
prime-time fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
With a new television season officially getting under way next Monday, a 
handful of returning series are laboring to provide viewers with blessed events 
as part of their new looks for 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the 58 established series on NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox will feature 
episodes in which prominent characters give birth. Two other old favorites also 
will boast new young faces. 
</P>
<P>
That may not amount to a bona-fide baby boom, but you get the idea. Infants are 
in this season. 
</P>
<P>
Top-rated NBC emerges as the most fertile network. 
</P>
<P>
In November, a sweeps month when viewership is especially critical to the 
networks, Ann and Stuart Markowitz (Jill Eikenberry, Michael Tucker) are likely 
to welcome their first child on "L.A. Law," while psychiatrists Frasier and 
Lilith (Kelsey Grammer, Bebe Neuwirth) of "Cheers" are expecting a new arrival 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
On the Sept. 18 season premiere of "ALF," the unreliable alien's first 
adventure in baby-sitting predictably goes awry when he loses the Tanners' son 
Eric (who was born at the end of last season). And "The Cosby Show" has a 
3-year-old scene stealer joining the Huxtable household Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
At ABC, English professor Gary (Peter Horton) and girlfriend Susannah (Patricia 
Kalember) will become parents during the fourth or fifth episode of 
"thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
On CBS, pregnant Charleyne (Jean Smart) and TV husband Doug Barr of "Designing 
Women" prepare for the birth of their first child, with a due date in the 
middle of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are "Newhart" yuppies Michael and Stephanie (Peter Scolari, 
Julia Duffy). Wed at the end of last season, they may see their bundle of joy 
in January. As the comedy opens its eighth season Sept. 18, the couple will be 
returning from a six-month honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of marriages, the Rev. Gregory and Thelma (Clifton Davis, Anna Maria 
Horsford) at long last will announce their engagement on the season premiere of 
"Amen," with a two-part wedding episode to follow during the November sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
Striking a more somber note, the season debut of "The Golden Girls" on Sept. 23 
will center on chronic fatigue syndrome. In a seriocomic two-part story written 
by the show's creator, Susan Harris, Dorothy (Bea Arthur) has a consultation 
with doctors who cannot find any cause for her pain and exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
In a subsequent episode, Rose (Betty White) finds a new job as the assistant to 
a local TV consumer reporter (Chick Vennera). 
</P>
<P>
A new job, editor and home await Hannah Miller (Jamie Lee Curtis) of "Anything 
But Love," an ABC comedy that has the dubious distinction of undergoing the 
most extensive overhaul among all returning series. 
</P>
<P>
Promoted from researcher to full-time writer, Hannah and fellow scribe Marty 
Gold (Richard Lewis) will report to an aggressive, energetic new boss (Ann 
Magnuson) in charge of their Chicago magazine, now a weekly instead of a 
monthly. Also joining the cast are Joseph Maher as a stuffy TV critic, Richard 
Frank as an executive assistant obsessed with demographics and Holly Fulger as 
a childhood friend who rents a room to Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
On Sundays, meanwhile, Angela Lansbury will continue to solve whodunits on 
"Murder, She Wrote." She just won't be solving them as often. 
</P>
<P>
In signing Lansbury for the popular mystery show's sixth season, CBS agreed to 
lighten her load. Consequently, she will play author Jessica Fletcher in 13 
episodes. In nine other shows, she will introduce the story, leaving the 
legwork to other characters. Those roles will be portrayed by an assortment of 
amateur sleuths such as Ken Howard, June Havoc, Barry Newman and Diana Canova. 
</P>
<P>
Other noteworthy prime-time changes focus on: 
</P>
<P>
New Faces 
</P>
<P>
NBC: When he isn't chasing Lucky the cat, "ALF" will contend with JM. J. 
Bullock, the former "Hollywood Square," who will play the brother of Willie 
Tanner (Max Wright). 
</P>
<P>
"Cheers": Tony-winning stage actor Roger Rees of "Nicholas Nickleby" fame 
portrays billionaire Robin Colcord, a corporate raider who pursues Rebecca 
(Kirstie Alley), prompting Sam (Ted Danson) to try to regain ownership of the 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
"Matlock": Enter Clarence Gilyard as a deputy sheriff who helps attorney Ben 
Matlock (Andy Griffith). Exit Kene Holliday, who had played Matlock's leg man, 
Tyler Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
"227": Paul Winfield is the apartment building's new landlord, the pompous 
Julian Barlow. 
</P>
<P>
ABC: As "Head of the Class" starts its senior year, students played by Michael 
DeLorenzo, Lara Piper and De'Voreaux White replace Tannis Vallely (Janice), 
Leslie Bega (Maria) and Jory Hussain (Jawaharlal). Rain Pryor -- Richard's 
daughter, who appeared in five episodes last season -- enrolls on a full-time 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
"China Beach": Ricki Lake, best known for her role in the John Waters movie 
musical "Hairspray," plays a cheerful Red Cross "doughnut dolly," with Ned 
Vaughn as a young doctor who befriends Boonie (Brian Wimmer). 
</P>
<P>
CBS: Adam Arkin joins the cul-de-sac dwellers of "Knots Landing," whose third 
episode will be the durable serial's 250th. He'll play a "mysterious" 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
"Dallas": TV's longest-running entertainment series adds Kimberly Foster as a 
fetching blond who "smells money" as the younger, unwelcome sister of April 
Stevens (Sheree J. Wilson); Sasha Mitchell as scheming James Richard Beaumont, 
the son of J.R. Ewing's old flame Vanessa Beaumont, and Michael Wilding as an 
art gallery owner who takes more than a professional interest in Cally, J.R.'s 
nubile young bride. 
</P>
<P>
"Falcon Crest": The network's other melodrama signs up Gregory Harrison as a 
wheeler-dealer and adversary to Richard Channing (David Selby); Mark Lindsay 
Chapman as a "charming" psychopath, and Andrea Thompson as Frank Agretti's (Rod 
Taylor) sexy stepdaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Tour of Duty": Carl Weathers ("Rocky's" Apollo Creed) is set for six episodes 
as a maverick colonel who takes charge of the unit; John Dye comes aboard as a 
medic and conscientious objector to the war in Vietnam. (Kim Delaney, who 
played reporter Alex Devlin, meets a "tragic" end during the second episode.) 
</P>
<P>
"60 Minutes": Former "West 57th" reporters Meredith Vieira and Steve Kroft join 
the veteran staff of prime-time TV's longest-running series, which on Sunday 
begins its 22nd year. 
</P>
<P>
New Directions 
</P>
<P>
NBC: Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet) is back, and "The Cosby Show" has her, in 
addition to her new husband (Joseph C. Phillips) and his 3-year-old daughter 
(Raven Symone). While the newlyweds settle in, Theo (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) 
decides to move out. He'll take an apartment with his New York University pals. 
</P>
<P>
"A Different World": Coach Walter Oakes (Sinbad) takes over the Hillman College 
dorm, which has gone co-ed, replacing Mary Alice. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. Law": Buttoned-down attorney Michael Kuzak (Harry Hamlin) loosens up this 
season. He finds a new love interest, gets involved in a major murder case and 
takes to the streets on a motorcycle, clad in jacket and jeans. 
</P>
<P>
"The Magical World of Disney": Two fresh series join Disney's wheel of rotating 
elements: "Brand New Life," a "Brady Bunch"-type sitcom with Barbara Eden and 
Don Murray as the parents of six children, and "Parent Trap," a Hayley 
Mills-Barry Bostwick comedy based on the 1961 film. 
</P>
<P>
"My Two Dads": Judge Wilbur (Florence Stanley) turns departed Dick Butkus' old 
diner into a chic French restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
ABC: It's the fall of 1969 on "The Wonder Years" as Kevin (Fred Savage) and 
Winnie (Danica McKellar) edge toward adolescence, the '70s and the eighth 
grade. The sparks will still fly between them as always, but a more mature 
Kevin will find time for other girls as well. 
</P>
<P>
"thirtysomething": Something called divorce still hangs over the heads of Eliot 
(Timothy Busfield) and Nancy (Patricia Wettig) who, as fans recall, never 
signed the requisite papers. That issue will be addressed in the first episode 
Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"Growing Pains": Mike Seaver (Kirk Cameron), who proposed to his girlfriend 
Julie (Julie McCullough) on last season's final episode, gets his answer on the 
season premiere Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
"ABC Saturday Mystery": The rotational series gets two new entries featuring 
familiar stars (and lollipops). Ex-angel Jaclyn Smith wings her way back to 
prime time as "Christine Cromwell," a San Francisco-based attorney and 
financial adviser, and Telly Savalas is back on the N.Y.P.D. payroll as 
"Kojak." 
</P>
<P>
CBS: Back for a second season, "Murphy Brown" still will be plugged into 
topical TV stories. One finds Murphy (Candice Bergen) writing a caustic memo 
criticizing her colleagues a la Bryant Gumbel of the "Today" show. In another, 
advertisers threaten to yank their commercials from a controversial episode of 
"FYI." 
</P>
<P>
"Knots Landing": The character to catch here is put-upon Olivia (Tonya Crowe), 
the daughter of "scheme queen" Abby (Donna Mills, who has left the show). It's 
hinted that Olivia may assume some of her mom's more conniving qualities. 
</P>
<P>
"Falcon Crest": A new production team hopes to reclaim a sizable audience for 
this sagging CBS series embarking on season No. 9. To that end, the show's 
writers will focus on younger characters such as Lance and Pilar (Lorenzo 
Lamas, Kristian Alfonso). Jane Wyman will appear in the first two episodes as 
matriarch Angela Channing, then will resurface at midseason. Richard Channing 
(David Selby) deals with single parenthood in the absence of wife Maggie (Susan 
Sullivan), who's left Tuscany Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturday Night With Connie Chung": That's the new title for a revamped "West 
57th." The producers reportedly are considering a one-story format that would 
include actors in the re-creations of events. 
</P>
<P>
And waiting in the network's wings -- to the vexation of its loyal fans -- is 
"Beauty and the Beast." The romantic fantasy's two-hour opener will air when an 
appropriate time period becomes available. Once "Beast" begins, its beauty 
(pregnant Linda Hamilton) will have a "reduced presence," says CBS 
Entertainment President Kim LeMasters.

DRIVER KILLED IN SEAL BEACH'S 'ALLEY OF DEATH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 19-year-old college student was killed in Seal Beach early Sunday along a 
stretch of road that nearby residents say has become an "alley of death." 
</P>
<P>
Hondo L. Vasquez of Norwalk was westbound in his Jeep Cherokee on Lampson 
Avenue near Heather Street about 12:30 a.m. when he apparently lost control of 
the vehicle and hit two power poles, police said. The Jeep flipped, ejecting 
Vasquez. He was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third major accident and the second traffic fatality on Lampson 
between Heather and Candleberry Avenue since Aug. 23, and Seal Beach City 
Councilman Frank Laszlo said he plans to raise the issue at tonight's council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem 'for Nearly 15 Years' 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a problem on that road for nearly 15 years, and residents in 
that area have a right to be concerned," said Laszlo, whose Council District 
No. 4 represents north Seal Beach, including College Park East, the housing 
tract bordered by Lampson. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime residents like Patty Campbell complained Sunday that Lampson has 
become a popular alternative for weary commuters trying to avoid the 
stop-and-go grind of the San Diego Freeway. As a result, traffic on Lampson, 
which divides College Park East and the Armed Forces Reserve Center at Los 
Alamitos, has steadily increased, and with it has come problems. 
</P>
<P>
Among the concerns is a sharp curve on Lampson between Heather and Candleberry 
that residents want realigned, according to Campbell. She said that some sort 
of center divider on Lampson is also needed to keep cars from crossing into 
oncoming traffic lanes, or even worse, plowing through a block wall separating 
the roadway from homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Those homes that back up to Lampson need some protection," said Campbell, who 
has lived in the 4400 block of Ironwood Avenue for nearly 20 years. An 
eight-foot wall is all that stands between her back yard and Lampson. 
</P>
<P>
"In some homes, the master bedroom is less than 15 feet from Lampson," Campbell 
said. "And the only thing separating the two is a block wall. It's just a 
matter of time before a car winds up in someone's bedroom. It's a frightening 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday, Campbell said she was awakened by the familiar sound of sirens. 
The sirens followed a loud explosion and a huge flash resembling lightning as 
the Jeep Cherokee struck the two power poles. Power was knocked out to about 
2,000 customers, mostly in Seal Beach, for more than four hours, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"The wires started arcing and it was like a lightning storm," Campbell said. 
"Then everything went dark, except for the glow from the flashing lights." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 23, Michael Barry Cliens, 19, of Los Alamitos died when his Chevrolet 
Camaro failed to make the curve on Lampson near Heather and struck several 
trees. Police estimate that the vehicle was traveling more than 85 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 1, a five-car pileup on the same stretch of Lampson during the evening 
rush hour seriously injuried two motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo said one solution may be to install concrete center dividers on Lampson 
similar to those on freeways. Another may be to coax motorists to slow down by 
recording their speed on a radar-fed, roadside speedometer with 12-inch-high 
digital numbers displayed on a screen built into the end of small trailer.

LEGISLATURE'S COUNTDOWN MAY INCLUDE JAIL PROPOSAL 
</P>

<BYLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The question of whether Orange County residents should be allowed to vote on a 
half-cent sales tax to pay for a new central jail is one of the thorny issues 
facing state lawmakers as they return today for the final frantic week of the 
1989 legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
The sales tax proposal -- touted by Orange County officials as their best hope 
to pay for the proposed $700-million jail in Gypsum Canyon, east of Anaheim 
Hills -- was killed by a hostile Assembly subcommittee last week. 
</P>
<P>
But now, with the hours ticking off the legislative clock, state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) is scrambling to find one last way to resuscitate 
her measure before lawmakers adjourn for the year by the Friday midnight 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amendment Pondered 
</P>
<P>
One approach being contemplated by Bergeson's office is simply amending the 
main points of the Orange County jail bill to a similar Assembly measure that 
is scheduled to come up for debate on the Senate floor this morning. The 
Assembly bill would allow the half-cent sales tax elections for jails in 
Humboldt, Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Bergeson said the amendments will be ready for action when the 
Senate convenes today. If the measure were to pass the Legislature, it might 
receive a warm reception from Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor has not seen this particular legislation," said Deukmejian 
spokesman Tom Beerman. "However, in the past, he has generally been receptive 
to allowing a vote of the people on sales tax measures aimed at a specific 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's last-minute maneuverings will be repeated dozens of times over by 
her Senate and Assembly colleagues this week as they labor long hours to finish 
delicate negotiations on matters great and small. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) displayed his characteristic 
bravado in predicting that the Legislature's collective agenda will be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're right on schedule," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bristling from criticism that they have been ineffective in dealing with some 
of the state's most pressing social, political and environmental problems, 
Deukmejian and legislative leaders set out to make 1989 one of their most 
productive in years. 
</P>
<P>
In June, they fashioned a long-range, $18.5-billion transportation improvement 
program, worked out a compromise to lift the voter-approved spending limit and 
approved legislation implementing a long-term public school financing plan. 
</P>
<P>
Then, hoping to capitalize on that success, they filled their legislative 
plates with measures offering sweeping solutions to some of the state's most 
difficult issues. But, with time running out in the session, it may be more 
than they can swallow. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bills, the top priority of the Speaker, is a plan to provide health 
benefits to many of the 5 million Californians who now have no insurance by 
requiring businesses with five or more full-time employees to provide coverage 
to their workers. 
</P>
<P>
The measure has been resisted by business groups, which have complained that 
private companies, particularly small ones, cannot afford to shoulder the 
burden of providing health insurance for those who do not have it. In response, 
Brown has been searching for funding -- perhaps in the form of a tax credit or 
a share of tobacco tax revenues -- that would soften the blow. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm going to have to have a way in which to reduce the hostility of 
the employers to get the governor's signature," Brown said. "But I think we can 
achieve that." 
</P>
<P>
Another bill would revamp the state's long-troubled, $8-billion system for 
compensating injured workers. The state system is the most expensive in the 
nation for employers, but provides benefits that are among the lowest. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation has been the subject of months of negotiations among 
Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) and representatives of Republican 
lawmakers, the governor, insurers, employers and organized labor. Public 
employees, lawyers and doctors have opposed the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Although Deukmejian last week charged that Margolin had amended the bill so 
much that it bears little resemblance to a version of the legislation he had 
supported months ago, Margolin maintains that the bill is very close to a form 
the governor could sign. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate sending a bill to the governor that doesn't have his 
support," Margolin said. 
</P>
<P>
Still another series of bills would promote recycling and toughen up state 
regulation of the state's waste management system. The new state program, which 
has been tentatively approved by the governor and legislative leaders, would 
replace the current and much maligned California Waste Management Board with a 
new full-time board and promote recycling of waste by requiring local 
governments to reduce the amount of solid waste going into landfills by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers are also working on legislation to implement Proposition 99, the 
tobacco tax increase initiative approved last year by voters. The proposed 
legislation will pump hundreds of millions in new tobacco tax receipts into a 
variety of local health programs to help poor Californians who cannot afford 
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to clean up their own image, lawmakers are also working on legislation 
to establish tighter ethical controls on state and local officeholders and 
candidates for office by banning honorariums and placing limits on their 
acceptance of gifts and outside income. 
</P>
<P>
High on Deukmejian's list of priorities is a proposed constitutional amendment 
that would allow convicts to work for private businesses. The plan is patterned 
after a program run by the California Youth Authority that puts inmates to work 
assembling computers and packaging utensils for a fast-food franchise. 
</P>
<P>
And to further complicate things, lawmakers still hope to restore $24 million 
cut by Deukmejian from family planning programs, deal with the future of Mono 
Lake and consider implementing a waiting period for all gun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, state Assembly members will vote on an Orange County-inspired 
bill, sponsored by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), that would double the fine -- 
to $200 from $100 -- for truck drivers caught going 10 miles over the posted 
speed limit. The measure has prompted stiff opposition from the trucking 
interests and unions. 
</P>
<P>
The busy week ahead has some top state officeholders sounding pessimistic 
warnings about how much of the legislation actually may win the necessary 
approval of both houses. 
</P>
<P>
After weeks of happy talk about how well the governor and Legislature were 
getting along, the strain of fashioning so many compromises on so many bills in 
such a short period of time has begun to show. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian was testy at a news conference last week, saying special interests 
appeared to be "winning" the battle to block individual bills that they 
opposed. Speaker Brown pointed the finger back at the governor. "He's vetoed 
four or five of my bills, but I don't hold a press conference and bellyache," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Assembly Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno lost his temper 
during a conference committee hearing on the tobacco tax legislation, accusing 
a Democratic colleague of "stupidity" for pressing an issue that threatened the 
delicate compromise that was coming together. 
</P>
<P>
Maddy, who has been meeting weekly with the governor and other legislative 
leaders, said "time may have caught up with us." 
</P>
<P>
But the Speaker was more optimistic. Brown noted that lawmakers and the 
governor are "about to close" an agreement on the solid waste issue and are 
nearing accord on several other matters. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic legislator said he expects to be able to complete talks on 
proposed constitutional amendments involving lawmaker ethics that will be 
submitted to the voters. He also expects lawmakers to agree on the bill to 
implement Proposition 99, the tobacco tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
"That's fairly good," Brown said. "Then if we really do a slam-dunk on my 
health insurance measure, whether we do workers compensation or auto insurance 
or not, it still will have been a spectacular session."

Carol Goldmark has no memory of the early morning rush-hour traffic accident 
five years ago that almost ended her life. 
</P>
<P>
Goldmark, 46, a Buena Park painter, had been southbound on the Santa Ana 
Freeway near the Magnolia off-ramp when she slammed into the car in front of 
her. 
</P>
<P>
She was airlifted to UCI Medical Center, where a team of trauma specialists 
waited. She suffered eight broken ribs, a ruptured spleen and a collapsed lung, 
and required nearly 50 pints of blood. She was told that twice she almost died. 
</P>
<P>
What is vivid to Goldmark is the care and treatment she received and the 
knowledge that had such treatment not been immediately available, she might not 
have survived. 
</P>
<P>
"The surgeon saved my kidney, my lung and my life several times over," she 
said. "I had treatment around the clock and every specialist that was needed 
was available." 
</P>
<P>
Goldmark said she was "terribly upset" at news of the planned closing of the 
trauma center at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I called the hospital and asked if there was anyway I could speak out to let 
people know that here is someone who survived, is healthy and here on this 
earth today because of a trauma center."

Suzanne Harbin knows the difference a few seconds can make. Those ticks of a 
clock became critically important on Jan. 8, 1981, the day her then-17-year-old 
son was struck by a car while walking his bike through a Huntington Beach 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Harbin suffered a massive brain hemorrhage and was rushed by ambulance 
to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, only a short drive 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"The car slammed into him at 45 m.p.h and he was thrown 125 feet, hitting the 
front of his head on the windshield and the back on the pavement," Harbin said. 
</P>
<P>
"He bled a lot but the ambulance was able to phone in his injuries and a trauma 
team was waiting and prepared for him. If he had had to go to another hospital, 
he would have died." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Harbin suffered brain damage, which mostly affects his judgment, and is 
still recovering in a Ventura hospital. But the 25-year-old is able to walk and 
talk, and is a wiz at electronics, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Harbin said she is "appalled" at the announcement that the hospital 
will close its trauma unit by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
"I have offered them money and offered to help raise money," she said. "I see 
no reason why people should let this (closing) go on. My son is walking 
testimony to the importance of this trauma center."

PEOPLE: AND NOW, FOR HIS NEXT TRICK, YOUTHFUL MAGICIAN HOPES TO MAKE FAME 
APPEAR

It wasn't the same kind of magic, but Jason Alexander makes his original last 
name disappear like a silver dollar in his palm. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think Sytnyk would fit my image," said Alexander, 19, of Newport 
Beach, about the last name he was born with. He hopes that Alexander, his stage 
name, will belong to a big, big star. "I'd like to take it to the top," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said he is trying to develop a style for himself and that the stage 
name fits his idea of his image better than his real name would. It's also 
easier to spell and pronounce. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to come off like a young James Bond figure. I think the world needs a 
classy young gentleman illusionist who sometimes performs in a tuxedo," said 
Alexander, whose interest in prestidigitation goes back to the seventh grade 
and who as a teen-ager won two first place awards from the Pacific Coast Assn. 
of Magicians for his stage performances. "Ever since I got in magic, I decided 
it was going to be my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, a Corona del Mar High School graduate who is a marketing major at 
USC, is paying his dues these days as a novice magician. He works at children's 
parties, trade shows, restaurants and local nightspots. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm working as much as I can," he said, "and I'm looking to the 
future. I'm trying to improve my skills as much as I can in as short a time as 
I can." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander has appeared at the Magic Castle in Los Angeles, where he is a member 
of the nightclub's junior magicians program. He credits Castle magicians for 
offering him some critical as well as some encouraging words. 
</P>
<P>
But his studying at USC shows he has a realistic side. "I don't ever hope to 
have to use it," he said of what he is learning in the marketing program, "but 
it's a hedge. Who knows what might happen? I might do both." 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, it's probably worth noting that he has a nifty floating 
dollar bill stunt. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that one of his assests, besides the ability to perform slick 
close-up magic tricks with fire, is his age. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I have my youth and I think people like that, but I know it won't be 
here forever," Alexander said. "Now the excitement for me is to be on the stage 
and hear the applause. For me there is nothing better than the applause. It's 
just heaven to me." 
</P>
<P>
Between his studies and his continual practicing of magic tricks, including 
some involving fire, Alexander auditions for roles in commercials and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"I've studied drama, and that helps when you're on a stage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander also knows there is a lot more to magic than what he has uncovered so 
far. "There are a lot of people who do magic better than I, and I listen to 
them, talk to them and learn from them," he said. "When a person is 19, he 
finds out how little he really knows." 
</P>
<P>
For the last six years, Jo Lindberg has been hugging people for a living with 
her Hug Grams business. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Orange resident, who calls herself Cuddles the Huggy Bear, the 
Ambassador of Hugs, has formed the Hugs for Health Foundation, a nonprofit 
organization that concentrates on visits to facilities such as convalescent 
hospitals, senior citizen centers and retirement homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to let people in those facilities know that someone cares for 
them," said Lindberg, who dresses as a bear when she makes her rounds. "I give 
17 different types of hugs," for different kinds of people with different kinds 
of needs, she says. 
</P>
<P>
The visits are called Operation Hug Day. During the a one-hour program, which 
costs $25, "I manage to give everyone a hug during the program and that 
includes residents, staff and guests at the facility I visit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her phone number is (714) 832-HUGS. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Lance Gilbertson began an intense study of Holospira, a genus of 
snails, as part of his work as a biology professor at Orange Coast College in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Holospira are about half an inch long and have both male and female 
reproductive systems. During one of his outings in some rugged high desert 
terrain two years ago, he discovered two new species. 
</P>
<P>
But the Newport Beach educator is humble about the find. 
</P>
<P>
"It adds slightly to the body of knowledge we have on the world's mollusks," 
said Gilbertson, who told of his discovery earlier this year at an 
international conference of malacologists -- scientists who study mollusks -- 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Lance is being overly modest. This really is a big deal," said OCC marine 
science professor Tom Garrison.

ARTS FESTIVAL TRIES TO HELP YOUNG LATINOS UNDERSTAND, APPRECIATE THEIR HERITAGE

Alfredo Calderon divides much of his time between refining the delicate art of 
Mexican mask making and defining the history of Mexican folklore. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 10 years, the 34-year-old teacher and artist from Pacoima has done 
extensive work and research on both and concludes that, among those of Mexican 
descent living in the United States, Mexican culture may be on a rapidly 
deteriorating path. 
</P>
<P>
"The youth in the new generation are going through a serious loss of cultural 
identity -- they are becoming generic Americans," Calderon said. "They think 
eating a few tacos and knowing a little of the language is what being Mexican 
is all about. With that line of thought, how can traditions be passed on?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Support for Traditions 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to build a better understanding of and increase support for these 
traditions, the Mexican-American Arts Council has for eight years sponsored a 
festival called "La Jamaica." Calderon was one of 27 Latino artists and 
craftsmen showcasing their work at this year's event, held Sunday at the Bowers 
Museum Courtyard in Santa Ana. Activities ranged from pinata making to detailed 
Mexican baking. As of mid-afternoon, the festival had attracted about 300 
people, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Events such this one do help in increasing the awareness of others," Calderon 
said from his booth, which displayed many of the masks he has made. "Learning 
can take place through so many different channels." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, who moved to California from Michoacan, Mexico, in 1964, said he 
developed his interest in his native country's folklore and mask making at a 
time when people were trying to deny their ethnic origins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Had to Assimilate' 
</P>
<P>
"I arrived in (the United States) during the period where you had to assimilate 
in order to survive," Calderon said. "There was no support for immigrants, so 
it was very easy to forget or at least to try to forget where you came from." 
</P>
<P>
After a short time in the United States, he developed what he calls a mental 
renaissance that prompted him to study the history of Mexico before the 1600s. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to see ourselves and the country of Mexico as something that didn't 
exist before we were colonized, before the Europeans . . . 'discovered us' and 
said we existed. Our art, music and customs began long before that, and I try 
to show that through my art," Calderon said. 
</P>
<P>
It is a lesson he shares with students at the Junior Arts Center in Los 
Angeles, where he teaches clay mask making. His masks represent various periods 
in Mexican history, including the Mayan and Aztecan. Prices start at $75 and go 
as high as $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
"Making the mask doesn't take as much time as doing the actual research," 
Calderon said. "It takes going back and truly understanding the culture and 
ideas of people at the time and of course learning from our forefathers." 
</P>
<P>
Another participant at the festival, Ose Arugio, 55, of Santa Ana, said he did 
learn valuable lessons from his ancestors. At age 11, in the same village of 
Michoacan, his grandfather taught him the craft of of huarache sandal making 
just as he had taught Arugio's father before him. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in the family learned how to make the shoes," said Arugio, who has 
lived in California for 30 years and owns a shoe store in Los Angeles. "It is a 
way of life and I taught each of my sons and daughters the art of it, so it is 
something that won't die for generations to come." 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's festival, Ricardo Cardenea of Santa Ana stood with his 1-year-old 
daughter and 3-year-old son at the site of a pinata breaking, wishing they 
could see an authentic pinata celebration back in his native state of 
Zacatecas, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is really nice and great for people like me who have kids and 
want them to know about their history," Cardenea said. "Though some of the 
things are not the same, they are trying to recognize our way of life and that 
is what is important. I am glad I decided to stop."

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: NUDIST STORY HELPS MODEST WRITER SHARE HIS INNER SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Visitors to McConville are told that when in Rome, do as the Romans do. 
</P>
<P>
In this Rome, however, Romans wear no togas. So guests must bare all with 
members of Orange County's only nudist camp. 
</P>
<P>
When I spent a Sunday last month visiting nudists to write about the camp, I 
was worried about having to disrobe in front of others. After all, it had been 
years since parts of my body had seen sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects of baring all on assignment made me nervous. What kind of 
reporter, I asked myself, would take off his clothes for a story? Flo Nilson, 
owner and manager of McConville -- still dressed during an interview shortly 
after my arrival at the secluded camp -- knew I was uncomfortable about having 
to talk to naked people later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
"Nudism is completely new for you, isn't it?" she asked in a motherly tone. 
</P>
<P>
After chatting with Nilson, she led me to the camp's pool, where several 
members of the McConville were relaxing in the buff -- and where nude-only 
swimming is the rule. 
</P>
<P>
So in order to talk to the Romans, I had to get naked. What I wouldn't do for 
an assignment. 
</P>
<P>
I clambered to the restroom near the pool to change, nervously smiling at a 
couple lounging naked in nearby lawn chairs. 
</P>
<P>
I debated journalistic ethics as I undressed in the restroom, asking myself if 
I really had to be in the buff to do the story. 
</P>
<P>
I took a deep breath and walked into the heat, holding a beach towel at my side 
like a kid clutching his security blanket. I walked toward the pool cautiously, 
making sure no one was taking a peek. 
</P>
<P>
At the pool, I met Times photographer Mark Mirko, who was wearing nothing but a 
photo vest. I kept my dark shades on to avoid eye contact with anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"This," I said, "is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, I felt funny about being naked. Instinctively, I wanted to hide. 
</P>
<P>
But then I realized no one bothered to look. As Nilson told us before we 
plunged into the world of nudism, people with clothes on are more conspicuous 
at such camps. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, I felt at home in the nude, though I never let go of my towel. 
I triumphed. 
</P>
<P>
McConville's secluded setting made that easy. Located on 320 rugged acres in 
the arid Cleveland National Forest 22 miles east of San Juan Capistrano, the 
camp is a peaceful, uninhibited setting that enables members to relax with 
nature. The colony, which calls itself the oldest continuously run nudist camp 
in the West, is decorated with mementoes of a bygone era, including old 
cultivating machines and antique mine carts. 
</P>
<P>
Like a reporter who in a 1933 documentary filmed at the site understands the 
camp and its people better when he's naked, I too, felt remarkably at ease in 
front of others. If anything, being naked helped me to better understand 
nudists. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I am not a Peeping Tom. I tried not stare at the dozen or so people around 
the pool, but I couldn't help it. I was in awe not of their bodies but rather 
their ability to walk around naked in front of others. 
</P>
<P>
Nudists have been labeled as weird or immoral, but after an afternoon at the 
camp, I found them to be some of the friendliest people I had ever met. Drivers 
in the buff honk and wave to passers-by on the grounds. Cabins scattered 
throughout the camp are usually unlocked, a sign of the trustworthy nature of 
nudists. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say nudists, some 33,000 in the country according to the American 
Sunbathing Assn., flaunt their nakedness in a crude display of perversity. 
</P>
<P>
These nudists say they don't get naked for the sake of cheap thrills. "Being 
nude isn't sexy," said Helen, a camp member for 35 years. Instead, there's a 
casual atmosphere about being nude in front of others that made me feel 
comfortable in the buff. 
</P>
<P>
Because nudists literally have nothing to hide, everyone becomes equal without 
clothes on. That teaches campers to treat their fellow nudists with respect. 
</P>
<P>
Because society often shuns nudity, some McConville members rarely talk about 
their hobby outside the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Barker, 33, of Tustin, for instance, called his weekend visits to 
McConville his most closely guarded secret. 
</P>
<P>
"I never did like clothes," he said in the buff, sprawled next to the pool. 
"The bad thing is that you have to put the damn things back on and head back." 
</P>
<P>
When Mirko and I left McConville, I was stunned that I actually had taken my 
clothes off in front of others. But it was so natural that I never gave it a 
second thought. 
</P>
<P>
And during my daylong visit, I didn't even get a scratch.

PILOT MAY HAVE PICKED A CANYON TOO TIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rescue experts speculated Sunday that a Marine reconnaissance aircraft found 
wrecked on a rugged slope near San Gorgonio Mountain may have flown into a 
treacherous canyon that was too narrow for the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Military investigators Sunday combed through the wreckage of the olive-colored 
OV-10A Bronco to determine the cause of the Aug. 24 crash near the highest peak 
in the San Bernardino Mountains, about 25 miles east of San Bernardino. Rescue 
workers late Sunday were trying to retrieve the bodies of the two crewmen 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
The wreckage was discovered Saturday. The plane had been missing 16 days since 
failing to return from a flight from Camp Pendleton in northern San Diego 
County. About 150 military and civilian aircraft spent days scouring 324,000 
square miles of Southern California desert and mountains between the Mexican 
border and Nevada before giving up the search 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Those who first spotted the crash site said the crew of the twin-engine plane 
may have tried to turn the craft around quickly when they realized that the 
plane was heading toward a wall in Whitewater Canyon, but did not have enough 
room to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Trapped Like a Fly in a Web' 
</P>
<P>
"They were trapped like a fly in a web," said Air Force Auxiliary Lt. Col. 
Keith Kelley of the Civil Air Patrol, who first spotted what appeared to be the 
wreckage and later notified a San Bernardino Sheriff's Department helicopter 
crew of its location. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were pilot Sergio R. Vivaldi, 29, of Port Chester, N.Y., and 
observer 1st Lt. Joel H. Piehl, 31, of Bismarck, N.D. They left Camp Pendleton 
on Aug. 24 for a three-hour training flight, said 1st Lt. Gene C. Browne, a 
spokesman for El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
Piehl's father, Howard Piehl, said he was somewhat relieved when Marine 
officials called to tell him that the plane had been found. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a piece of mind we've been waiting for," Piehl said Sunday from Bismarck. 
"It was a long time to wait." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the wreckage was identified by a helicopter crew that was 
ferrying the body of Banning City Manager Thomas Huebner, who died of an 
apparent heart attack while hiking Friday in San Bernardino National Forest 
just two miles from the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
Huebner, credited with restoring confidence to his city's troubled Police 
Department, suffered the attack on the Vivian Creek Trail near Forest Falls, 
authorities said. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to Figure It Out 
</P>
<P>
A helicopter was sent to retrieve the body Saturday morning, San Bernardino 
Sheriff's Department Sgt. Jim Singley said. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-five minutes later, the crew came across the plane wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley of the Civil Air Patrol said that although the Marines had suspended the 
search for the plane, the CAP continued to fly over the area daily. 
</P>
<P>
"I must have spent 20 hours in air and another 20 on the phone to figure this 
thing out," said Kelley, 70, a Van Nuys resident who who started mountain 
search rescues in 1943. "After a while, you begin to piece together what had 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Because the plane's route was not known, and radar was unable to track it, 
Marine officials relied upon civilian reports in the search. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley was tipped off by a report of a boom and smoke in the area about 12:10 
p.m. on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Blue-gray smoke was spotted at about 8,000 feet by forestry workers on San 
Gorgonio Mountain. They immediately dispatched a helicopter to the area because 
of the threat of fire, said Lt. Col Frank Burnham, a Civil Air Patrol 
intelligence officer. 
</P>
<P>
But when the helicopter got to the area, there was no smoke or fire, and the 
wreckage was never seen, because the plane actually crashed at 6,100 feet in 
"the most vicious aircraft trap," Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
High winds, steep terrain and poor visibility make flying in the area a hazard, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley, a retired Air Force search-and-rescue squadron commander, spotted what 
he thought was the wreckage Friday while making a pass in a fixed-wing aircraft 
in a quarter-mile-wide gorge about two miles southeast of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
He alerted Singley and Sheriff's Deputy Rich Miller, who were in their 
helicopter returning Huebner's body to their station. They hovered 50 feet 
above the spot and saw the wreckage wedged into a crevice. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine craft, the same color as surrounding vegetation, was not easy to 
spot, Singley said, but then he saw the crew's colorful parachutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw what looked like an orange sleeping bag laying on the side of a very 
steep ravine," he said. "As we got closer, I noticed it was a parachute that 
was also white and green. Then I said, 'Hey, there's the wreckage.' " 
</P>
<P>
The plane was found 50 feet below the parachute, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Piece the Size of a Desk 
</P>
<P>
"It was an extensive wreckage," Singley said. "The biggest piece was the size 
of a desk." 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how the Marines were killed, but judging from 
scattered wreckage and steep terrain, Singley said, they were probably killed 
on impact. The bodies were found 10 hours after the wreckage was first spotted. 
</P>
<P>
The crew belonged to Marine Observation Squadron 2, Marine Aircraft Group 39, 
at Camp Pendleton. The group is part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, with 
headquarters at El Toro.

Barry Sanders never did it. Neither did Billy Sims, or Johnny Rodgers, or Mike 
Rozier or any other Heisman Trophy winner produced by the Big Eight. 
</P>
<P>
Not once -- until Saturday -- had a Big Eight rookie made his rushing debut 
with a 200-yard game. 
</P>
<P>
Blaise Bryant, who led the nation's junior college rushers last year, rolled up 
213 yards on 27 carries as Iowa State swamped Ohio University, 28-3, in its 
season opener at Ames. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1, 200-pound Bryant, a Cypress High and Golden West College product, 
said he carried the ball "more than I expected to." 
</P>
<P>
"I made a lot of mistakes, like cutting the wrong way or slipping, but I need 
to thank the offensive line for making my mistakes turn into gains," said 
Bryant.

WASHINGTON SEES THE LIGHT IN THE SHADOWS; 
</P>
<P>
OUTFIELDER FINDS HIS WAY HOME AS ANGELS SCRATCH A RUN OFF LAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The time on the Anaheim Stadium scoreboard was creeping toward 5:30 p.m., when 
Claudell Washington stepped to the plate in the bottom of the 14th inning on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels and Boston Red Sox were tied, 1-1, and neither team had mounted a 
serious threat since the Angels had tied the score back in the eighth. The 
traditional 14th-inning stretch -- with a Tommy James and the Shondells' song, 
"Mony, Mony" substituted for "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" -- had come and 
gone. It was getting late. 
</P>
<P>
If the Angels are to mount a late-season comeback and overtake division-leading 
Oakland, as they insist they can, this was the kind of game they needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
Until the eighth, it appeared that Boston and Roger Clemens would record a 1-0 
shutout and salvage the third game of the series. Oakland had beaten the New 
York Yankees, 6-2, so if the Angels were to remain within five games, they 
needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens had a perfect game going until Devon White singled to left with one out 
in the fourth. He had seven strikeouts entering the eighth and had limited the 
Angels to three hits. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark McLemore, the Angel second baseman, walked, went to second on a 
sacrifice and scored when Washington singled sharply to right. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tough enough to hit off at night, but when it's twilight conditions (it's 
nearly impossible)," Washington said of the shadows that stretched across home 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
However, Washington said the pitch he hit was a fastball, Clemens' best pitch 
and the most feared heater this side of Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
The score remained tied until the 14th, when Washington led off the inning. 
Dennis Lamp had come on to pitch for the Red Sox in the 13th and looked strong, 
striking out two of the three batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
Washington stepped up against Lamp and promptly singled to right. White, the 
next batter, sacrificed Washington to second. 
</P>
<P>
Next came Chili Davis, whose hard-hit grounder was smothered by a diving Reed. 
Reed jumped quickly to his feet but had no chance to get Davis at first. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Angels had runners at first and third with one out and Wally Joyner up 
to bat. The Red Sox decided to walk Joyner intentionally, setting up a force at 
any base. To make it tougher, they also moved right fielder Carlos Quintana to 
the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing played right into their hands with a slow grounder to shortstop 
Luis Rivera, who was stationed halfway between second and third. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera scooped up the ball but then bobbled it, dropped it, picked it up and 
bobbled it again as Washington made it home with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"I never looked back," Washington said. "I just took off for home." 
</P>
<P>
It was a strange ending to a strange game. But a victory, any victory, is vital 
to the Angels' hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, among others, said the Angels are not done yet. He pointed to other 
teams that have rallied from similar September deficits. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at what happened to the Cubs (in 1969)," he said. "Or the Phillies (in 
1964). There's a shot. As long as there's a shot, we have to play hard." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels remain five games behind Oakland with 19 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
"It could happen," Washington said. "I'd like to see it happen." 
</P>
<P>
He paused for a moment and then added: "I know we can come back." 
</P>
<P>
If an Angel rally comes to pass, Washington's contributions in Sunday's victory 
will be remembered as one of the keys.

Profile of AT&amp;T Stockholders Changing: Retirees still make up the biggest 
block of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. shareholders, but those who 
have bought stock since the Bell System breakup tend to be younger and more 
interested in growth, the company says in a new survey. AT&amp;T is the most 
widely held stock in the nation at 2.6 million shareholders. Among survey 
findings: 70% of shareholders are 50 or older; 28% are under 50, compared with 
15% in 1983; and shareholders still rate security as their top reason for 
owning AT&amp;T stock, although growth has moved into second place.

Stealth Bomber Designers Honored: The Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 
has cited John F. Cashen, James E. Kinnu, Irving T. Waaland and the late John 
Paterno for designing the B-2 Stealth bomber. Cashen, a former Bell Labs and 
Hughes Aircraft scientist, is a specialist in low radar observability and was 
chiefly responsible for the ability of the B-2 to elude enemy radar. Waaland 
was the aerodynamicist credited with designing the B-2's unusual flying wing 
configuration. Kinnu is a military electronics expert and Paterno was general 
manager of the program.

<P>
A Greek parliamentary committee recommended today that former Socialist Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou be prosecuted on charges of telephone tapping 
during his eight years in office. 
</P>
<P>
"We recommend . . . his prosecution for illegal telephone tappings" of 
political opponents, newspapers and journalists, and for violating the 
constitutional right to privacy of communications, said the report submitted to 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first recommendation against Papandreou by one of the committees 
investigating a series of scandals that rocked the Socialist government before 
its crushing defeat in the June elections. 
</P>
<P>
Another committee will report Friday on whether there are any links between 
Papandreou and a $200-million embezzlement scandal involving the private Bank 
of Crete. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's recommendation will be studied by the 300 deputies in 
Parliament, who will vote next week on whether to prosecute the 70-year-old 
Socialist leader.

A West German nurse dubbed "the angel of death" was sentenced to 11 years in 
prison today for killing patients with lethal injections to end their 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Michaela Roeder, 31, was found guilty of six counts of manslaughter and one 
each of attempted manslaughter and mercy killing. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence and the court's decision that 
compassion was Roeder's motive angered some members of the public in the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Unsuspecting colleagues called Roeder "the angel of death" because of the 
number of people who died while she was on duty.

A Simi Valley roofing contractor has been arrested on suspicion of felony child 
molesting in which two young girls were victims, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Richard George Grabowski, 35, was arrested Friday afternoon after a two-week 
investigation, Simi Valley police said. Police declined to release details of 
the investigation or circumstances of the alleged molesting but reported that 
the victims were two local girls, ages 11 and 12. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was prompted by a report of the alleged molesting of the 
girls on Aug. 26, police said. On Friday, detectives conducting a surveillance 
of Grabowski arrested him at 4:20 p.m. near his home on Walnut Street near Tapo 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Grabowski this morning remained in the Ventura County Sheriff's Department jail 
in Ventura in lieu of $250,000 bail, officials said.

2 SANTA ANA MEN SHOT BY POLICE, 1 IN FAMILY BRAWL, 1 AFTER FLIGHT

<P>
Two Santa Ana men are in critical but stable condition today after being shot 
by Santa Ana police in separate incidents Sunday night. Police said each had 
become combative when approached. 
</P>
<P>
One victim, Andres Cervantes, 26, was shot in the stomach after he wrested an 
officer's gun away from him during a family brawl, department spokesman Maureen 
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, police responded at 8:41 p.m. to a report of a family fight in 
the street in the 100 block of East Myrtle Street. 
</P>
<P>
"As two officers approached the fight, they were attacked by six family members 
without any provocation," she said. Three fought one officer to the ground and 
were trying to remove his gun from his holster when the other officer, fighting 
three other men, saw what was happening and fired one bullet, striking 
Cervantes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes was treated by paramedics and taken to Western Medical Center, where 
he underwent surgery Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
All six men were arrested, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier incident, Jesse James Elizalde, 38, was shot in the arm and leg 
after he ran from two police officers who suspected him of speeding, Thomas 
said. As they tried to follow the car and stop it, Elizalde jumped out and ran 
to a house in the 500 block of South Franklin Street, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
After he was chased through the house and out the back door, Elizalde grabbed a 
four-foot metal pipe and charged at one officer, who drew his baton, Thomas 
said. When Elizalde grabbed the baton and refused to drop it, the officer shot 
him from a distance of about two feet, she said. Elizalde was taken to Fountain 
Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not release the names of the officers pending the conclusion of the 
investigations.

REPUTED COCAINE RING MONEY MAN PLEADS INNOCENT

The reputed finance chief of the Medellin cocaine cartel pleaded innocent to 
money laundering today and was jailed without bond after prosecutors argued he 
might flee the country no matter how high his bail. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Martinez Romero -- the first of Colombia's "Extraditables" brought to 
the United States for trial in a drug crackdown launched last month -- entered 
the plea before U.S. Magistrate Joel M. Feldman. Martinez, 36, was extradited 
under heavy guard Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez is accused of helping launder $1.2 billion in drug profits through 
U.S. banks for the Medellin cartel, which is believed to supply 80% of the 
cocaine in the United States. It is based in the Colombian city of Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez is among the so-called "Extraditables," a list of drug figures wanted 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He could receive 30 years in prison under Colombian law or life under U.S. law. 
Defense attorney Ed Garland said it is not clear which law applies. 
</P>
<P>
The magistrate today agreed with Assistant U.S. Atty. Wilmer Parker III that 
Martinez might flee if freed on bail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Escaped Arrest in Panama 
</P>
<P>
"Colombia is hardly the only country in the world where Mr. Martinez could live 
and live quite comfortably with the millions of dollars to which he has 
access," the prosecutor said. Parker noted that Martinez escaped an arrest 
attempt in Panama in March shortly after his indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Garland and co-counsel Oscar Rodriguez of Miami told the magistrate that their 
client has a graduate degree in marketing from a Colombian university, has been 
married 15 years, has four children and has held legitimate jobs at Medellin 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
"He has never come to the United States other than to bring his children to 
Disney World on a vacation," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Garland asked the magistrate to put Martinez under a form of house arrest. He 
also argued that Martinez was accused only of laundering drug money, a 
"financial transaction" not serious enough to keep him without bail. 
</P>
<P>
But the magistrate disagreed. "It is well recognized that money is what oils 
the machine that allows these unlawful activities such as cocaine distributing 
. . . to go on," he said. "It is a very serious offense." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Held in Solitary Confinement 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said Martinez is being held in solitary confinement at an undisclosed 
location. The hearing was postponed to today after Martinez said last week that 
he speaks only Spanish and did not fully understand the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Weldon Kennedy, agent in charge of the FBI office in Atlanta, has said agents 
are on "an increased state of alert" against any retaliation from the cartel. 
Latin America's drug barons have carried out bombings and shootings in Colombia 
in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Drug traffickers are said to fear extradition to the United States because they 
believe they will not be able to escape conviction and prison. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was indicted in March as a result of a 2 1/2-year investigation dubbed 
Operation Polar Cap. The investigation resulted in charges against 127 people 
and two Latin American banks. Martinez is reputed to be the cartel's 
coordinator of a complex, competitive business that has laundered at least $15 
billion.

A pile of more than 1 million used tires caught fire for the second time in 
five years and spewed acrid, black smoke today, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 people were evacuated from their homes and several roads were closed. 
</P>
<P>
"By one report, there were flames going up 30 feet in the air," said John 
Gifford, spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Management. He said it 
could take days or even weeks to put out the blaze at the seven-acre dump. 
</P>
<P>
Another fire burned at the site for days in 1984, and state officials have been 
trying to get the pile cleared since then. Earlier this summer, Gov. Judd Gregg 
declared the gargantuan pile "a plague on Danville and the state."

YELTSIN, TAKING STOCK OF U.S., TOURS NYSE

Maverick Soviet politician Boris Yeltsin today visited the heart of American 
capitalism -- the New York Stock Exchange -- to get a firsthand glimpse of the 
inner workings of the American economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet lawmaker toured the trading floor with John Phelan, the chairman of 
the exchange. Phelan showed Yeltsin, through the help of an interpreter, how 
the countless video machines on the exchange floor spew out stock quotes and 
keep tabs on the latest market information. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed quite interested in the mechanics of the system," said Sharon 
Gasmin, a spokeswoman for the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
During Yeltsin's 15-minute tour, the Soviet politician expressed surprise at 
the number of women working on the floor of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's trip to Wall Street occurred a day after a meeting with reporters, a 
helicopter tour of the city and a walk in Central Park, where he shook hands 
with smiling New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
Before answering questions, Yeltsin, who wore a red Soviet flag pin in the 
lapel of his suit jacket, said he was impressed with the capital of the 
capitalist world. 
</P>
<P>
"New York is not a series of gravestones with slums in between, but rather the 
buildings represent a high level of artistic achievement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin kept up his image as a thorn in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's side by 
contending that the Soviet economy is in the worst shape in decades and that 
the leader is moving too slowly in implementing reforms. 
</P>
<P>
For the economy to recover from its malaise, Moscow would have to step up the 
pace of reform dramatically and seek assistance from the United States, he 
said.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher assailed Japan today for closing 
its markets to American goods and services but praised South Korea for opening 
its markets wider. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher told South Korean businessmen that Washington applauds Seoul's spirit 
of cooperation in response to trade pressure, imposed in particular through the 
1988 U.S. Trade Act. 
</P>
<P>
But he was critical of Japan's efforts and promised to voice his criticism when 
he visits Tokyo on Tuesday after his three-day visit to Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"We opened our markets. And we worked to create a trading system that would 
allow for everyone to prosper. Now it's Japan's turn to show the same kind of 
commitment to the world trading system," Mosbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thankfully, I don't have that kind of message to deliver in Korea today," he 
said.

A government-industry task force today recommended work to increase the safety 
of 1,900 older McDonnell Douglas DC-8, DC-9, DC-10 and MD-80 jetliners at an 
average cost of $290,000 per aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The $563-million proposal was announced at a news conference by the Air 
Transport Assn., which set up the panel 14 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The group proposed modification or replacement of parts rather than continued 
inspection of the airliners. The advice is similar to recommendations made by 
another task force that studied airliners manufactured by the Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the changes are already being made at airline maintenance bases, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel reviewed 3,900 service bulletins put out by McDonnell Douglas. Only 
159 were for recommended modification or replacement action. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration, which made the Boeing recommendations 
mandatory in May, participated in the latest group along with airlines, 
manufacturers and some foreign aviation safety officials. The regulatory agency 
is expected to adopt the McDonnell Douglas recommendations for U.S. airlines, 
and most foreign carriers are likely to comply. 
</P>
<P>
A third study will cover older airliners built by other manufacturers.

The effort by the United States and other top industrial countries to stabilize 
the value of the dollar has broken down, running the risks of higher U.S. trade 
deficits in future years, economists at a Washington research institute said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"The coordination process is in shambles," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of 
the Institute for International Economics. 
</P>
<P>
He said the effort launched by the United States and the governments of Japan, 
West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy had failed to keep the dollar 
from rising this year above the upper targets set by the world's richest 
industrial countries. 
</P>
<P>
That will spell trouble down the road as American exporters find that the 
higher value of the dollar makes it more difficult to sell their goods abroad, 
Bergsten said at a news conference.

An environmental group, the National Toxics Campaign, announced today it has 
signed up a half-dozen grocery chains in a pledge to shift growers away from 
using pesticides, especially cancer-causing chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists called the agreement a major breakthrough, although it 
amounted to little more than a general pledge to work toward elimination of 
pesticide use. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of a national campaign," said Craig Merrilees of the 
National Toxics Campaign, calling the pact a "first of a kind . . . dramatic 
breakthrough" for the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
The participants represent fewer than 200 stores in the United States and are 
firms primarily in California and Arizona -- Raley's with 55 stores in the 
Sacramento area and Abco Supermarkets with about 60 stores in Arizona -- that 
have broken ranks before with their industry colleagues on the pesticide issue.

The World Bank, long criticized for funding environmentally damaging projects, 
today announced increased lending to population-control projects and forestry 
development to help combat global atmospheric warming. 
</P>
<P>
Bank President Barber Conable told a conference on the environment that the 
bank "is committed to environmental issues and, what is more, this commitment 
does not detract at all from our primary mission of global development." 
</P>
<P>
The American president of the leading institution for funding Third World 
development spoke at the opening of a conference called to address how to raise 
living standards in poor countries while preserving the environment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Japan 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Japanese government and the U.N. Environment Program, the 
conference has drawn dozens of officials and experts from many countries and 
international organizations. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the conference Wednesday they are expected to issue 
recommendations on ways to combat the main problem on the agenda: global 
warming. Scientists warn that the so-called greenhouse effect could scorch 
parts of the Earth and raise sea levels unless checked. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, whose country is under 
environmentalists' attack as the biggest importer of tropical forest products, 
pledged increased assistance to research on sustainable development of tropical 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu, welcoming the conferees, said Japan intends to raise its foreign 
environmental aid to $2.25 billion in three years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Positive Vigor' 
</P>
<P>
"Japan is ready to take on global environmental issues with positive vigor," he 
said, reporting that he discussed such issues in depth during his 
just-completed series of summit meetings in the United States, Canada and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Conable said the world's population, currently about 5 billion, will grow to 6 
billion by the year 2000, adding to the use of fossil fuels that is blamed for 
the greenhouse effect and atmospheric warming. 
</P>
<P>
He announced that the bank is establishing a gas development unit to promote 
use of natural gas because it is the least polluting of fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
"I am also pleased to announce a tripling of our lending to forestry in the 
next few years," Conable said. 
</P>
<P>
On population-control projects, he said lending has amounted to over $500 
million in the last five years and that level will increase to more than $800 
million in the 1990-92 period.

DREXEL PLEADS GUILTY, TO PAY RECORD FINE; 
</P>
<P>
$650-MILLION ACCORD CLOSES BOESKY CHAPTER

<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. today pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to 
pay a record amount of more than $650 million to settle criminal charges in the 
largest securities fraud case ever. 
</P>
<P>
The plea closes a chapter in a Wall Street corruption saga that stemmed from 
the Ivan Boesky inside-trading scandal of three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the New York investment firm, which grew into a financial 
powerhouse in the 1980s, entered the plea. 
</P>
<P>
The plea had been expected since Drexel and the government reached an agreement 
in January after months of negotiations and legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
It clears the way for implementation of a separate settlement between Drexel 
and the Securities and Exchange Commission reached in April that places Drexel 
under unprecedented government supervision for three years and revamps its 
management. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Date to '84 
</P>
<P>
Drexel pleaded guilty to four counts of securities fraud and two of mail fraud 
and agreed to pay $650 million plus interest and $15.15 million in civil 
insider trading fines to resolve charges dating to 1984. More than $500 million 
of the amount was due immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Based upon the information before me, Drexel is in no position to dispute the 
government's charges," Drexel attorney Thomas F. Curnin said in court. 
</P>
<P>
The charges involve six stock transactions involving Drexel, its top bond 
trader Michael Milken and often Boesky, who provided the government much of the 
information used in the case after he agreed to cooperate in 1986. He is now in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
The schemes included stock manipulation, failure to make required financial 
disclosures to the SEC and stock "parking," a means of concealing ownership of 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Drexel was ordered to pay $300 million in criminal fines 
and penalties, plus interest, and set aside $350 million in a fund for paying 
claims of damages. 
</P>
<P>
Milken and his brother Lowell have been indicted separately on charges of 
racketeering and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government dropped a requirement that Drexel withhold Michael 
Milken's 1988 compensation of more than $100 million and half his brother's pay 
for last year. The Milkens had fought the requirement as unconstitutional.

Texas Rangers catcher Jim Sundberg said today he will retire at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Sundberg said his sore shoulder, a bad thumb on his catching hand and a bad 
knee told him it was time to quit. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Sundberg has played only three times and started once since 
Geno Petralli returned from the disabled list Aug. 19. Sundberg is hitting .189 
with two homers and six RBIs in 132 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 8, Sundberg reached a career milestone in Toronto when he moved past Al 
Lopez into second place on the all-time games-caught list. Sundberg has caught 
1,025 games in his 16 major league seasons. Only Bob Boone of Kansas City, at 
2,171, has caught more games. 
</P>
<P>
One of the top defensive catchers in major league history, Sundberg has a 
career fielding percentage of .993, third among catchers with 1,000 or more 
games. He has only 81 errors. 
</P>
<P>
Sundberg said he has considered going into broadcasting.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner Hugh Culverhouse is entertaining bids that could 
move the NFL franchise to sports-hungry Sacramento, according to a published 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucs have been offered $50 million for the move, the St. Petersburg Times 
reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed deal is similar to offers Sacramento has made to at least six 
other NFL franchises, including the Los Angeles Raiders, Buffalo Bills and New 
England Patriots -- $50 million cash for the team, a new $100-million stadium 
and guaranteed ticket revenues over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The offer is being made by city and county officials and the Sacramento Sports 
Assn., a private group of developers. 
</P>
<P>
Culverhouse had no comment on the report Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sacramento developer Gregg Lukenbill, the Tampa Bay offer is 
little more than a safety net should the Raiders choose to return to Oakland, 
their home before they moved to Los Angeles in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing to it, and I wouldn't pay any attention to it," Lukenbill, 
managing partner of the National Basketball Assn.'s Sacramento Kings, told the 
Sacramento Bee on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Raiders deal doesn't work, maybe I'll look elsewhere. But I'm on track 
to get the Raiders deal done, and I feel ethically bound to do that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Joe Benbenuti, a partner of Lukenbill's and a member of the Sacramento 
Sports Authority, acknowledged to the Bee that the group has contacted "a 
half-dozen teams."

World champion and Tour de France winner Greg LeMond will be taken to court by 
his current team ADR for alleged breach of contract, the team's owner Francois 
Lambert said today. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond is to announce Wednesday in Paris which team he will ride for next year. 
But he will definitely leave ADR, and is widely expected to sign a three-year 
contract worth $5.7 million with the French outfit Z. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert said he will seek compensation from LeMond for breaking his two-year 
contract with ADR after only one season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all in the hands of my lawyers now. If he signs somewhere else, we're 
going to court to get what we're entitled to. He has a two-year contract and he 
can't get out of it," Lambert told Reuters in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would seek compensation equaling one year's salary with Z -- almost 
$2 million. 
</P>
<P>
He said LeMond's salary this year was $300,000.

<P>
A Simi Valley roofing contractor has been arrested on suspicion of felony child 
molesting in which two young girls were victims, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Richard George Grabowski, 35, was arrested Friday afternoon after a two-week 
investigation, Simi Valley police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to release details of the investigation or circumstances of the 
alleged molesting but reported that the victims were two local girls, aged 11 
and 12. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was prompted by a report of the alleged molesting of the 
girls on Aug. 26, police said. On Friday, detectives conducting a surveillance 
of Grabowski arrested him at 4:20 p.m. near his home on Walnut Street near Tapo 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Grabowski this morning remained in the Ventura County Sheriff's Department jail 
in Ventura in lieu of $250,000 bail.
