<P>
In yet another last-minute effort to resolve a bitter redistricting dispute, 
lawyers for the City Council and the Chicano Federation said Tuesday that they 
expect to settle the case today. 
</P>
<P>
The word of an impending settlement was the cap to a daylong flurry of activity 
in which a compromise settlement was at one point off, then on, then off again, 
and finally on. 
</P>
<P>
Looming over the political and legal maneuvering was the specter of sworn 
depositions of former workers, current employees and members of the five-member 
council majority that had approved a redistricting map the Chicano Federation 
claimed would not sufficiently increase Latino voting strength in the city's 
8th District, which stretches from downtown to the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Public depositions that were to begin this morning now won't -- at least not 
until U.S. District Judge John Rhoades orders them to go forward, which he 
could do as early as noon if he is not satisfied that a settlement has been 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
If things go smoothly, the City Council will call a special closed-door meeting 
for 9:30 a.m. Thursday to formally vote on the compromise solution. 
</P>
<P>
As described by attorneys involved, the proposed settlement calls for adoption 
of a redistricting map that mainly changes Districts 2 and 8, giving District 8 
a Latino makeup of about 53.8%. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the proposal, among other things, includes agreements covering 
aspects such as legal fees and how tabulations from the current federal census 
will be accommodated in the future. According to sources familiar with the 
proposed settlement, Michael Aguirre, lawyer for the Chicano Federation, would 
be paid as much as $150,000 in legal fees by the city. 
</P>
<P>
The map under discussion is very similar to one proposed last week by the 
Chicano Federation, which two years ago filed a class-action voting rights 
lawsuit against the council in an attempt to force the creation of a district 
in which a Latino would have a likely chance of being elected. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposed district would take the Nestor area from the South Bay and 
connect it to District 2 by way of a line down San Diego Bay. The Nestor 
neighborhood encompasses about 8,000 people, most of them Anglo. They would be 
linked politically to District 2, another largely Anglo area composed mainly of 
Point Loma and Mission Hills. District 2 is represented by Councilman Ron 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the splitting away of Nestor from the South Bay was opposed by three 
council members -- including District 8 Councilman Bob Filner -- who said such 
a neighborhood division had the potential to create racial strife. That was one 
of the main reasons the proposal was rejected after it initially received 
approval from the council members. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the same three council members -- Filner, Linda Bernhardt and John 
Hartley -- said Tuesday they now will support the plan for a Nestor-less 
District 8. 
</P>
<P>
Filner said he still isn't happy with what happened with Nestor, but said it is 
not worth delaying a settlement of the lawsuit. "It's not a good policy 
decision . . . (but) you have to do trade-offs to get the city back to 
business," he said. " . . . We only did this because we thought it would end 
this thing." 
</P>
<P>
As for possible racial strife, Filner said he and others will have to work with 
the South Bay communities to make sure such violence is not a consequence of 
redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
Although Filner and his colleagues bemoaned the loss of Nestor, Aguirre said he 
and the federation have given up their claim to have a small but important 
bayside precinct kept in Roberts' District 2. The precinct has only about 1,000 
people -- in a district with a population of about 127,000 -- but it includes 
the Convention Center, Seaport Village, Santa Fe railroad property and other 
blocks undergoing intense development. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said he is sorry that, under the proposed settlement, Roberts won't get 
that waterfront area, and that he is to blame for its being retained in 
District 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron Roberts has been very good to us . . . without him, we wouldn't be where 
we are," Aguirre said, but added that the Chicano Federation would be 
"hard-pressed" to hold up an agreement so Roberts could keep the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that, having supported (Aguirre) . . . he would be willing to 
drop that at such a crucial time," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said he wanted the depositions to occur so there would be answers about 
whether some members of the majority bloc that approved the disputed 
redistricting map had met illegally in secret to craft the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that's become increasingly clear," he said, is that, as the 
deadline for depositions neared, members of the majority bloc were willing to 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The day began Tuesday with no settlement in sight, as the council met in closed 
session to vote on a redistricting map nearly identical to what is expected to 
be agreed on today. The council voted 5 to 3 for the map, with Roberts, Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor and Councilwoman Judy McCarty in opposition. Councilman Bruce 
Henderson left the meeting and did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking a settlement was at hand, city attorneys and David Lundin, the lawyer 
for Filner, Hartley and Bernhardt, then appeared before Judge Rhoades in the 
afternoon. But Darlene Rohr, representing Aguirre, who was in Los Angeles, told 
the judge that the proposal was "vastly" different than the one Aguirre had put 
forth last week, and that the parties were not near a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades, saying the case had become a "political and constitutional roller 
coaster," then ordered depositions to begin this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Lundin fumed after the hearing. "This is a cheap political . . . contest 
engaged in by Mr. Aguirre and a minority of the City Council," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour later, Aguirre and Lundin talked on the phone, and the elements 
of the newest compromise came into focus. Judge Rhoades -- who held a 
conference call with Lundin, Aguirre and Senior Chief Deputy City Atty. Jack 
Katz -- was asked to convene a hearing early Tuesday night to accept the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
But the hearing was called off as the two sides continued to debate nuances of 
the agreement. The judge directed Lundin and Aguirre to talk further and draft 
a settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said he expects a settlement to be reached and will deliver to Lundin 
this morning a written agreement. Lundin and the city attorney will review the 
proposal, then hold a telephone conference call with Rhoades, who today starts 
a temporary stint on the federal bench in Montana.

TWO WOMEN SENTENCED FOR TRYING TO HIRE HIT MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mother and aunt of two suspects in a drug case have been sentenced to 37 
months in federal prison for trying to hire a hit man to kill two witnesses in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Walters, 42, and her sister, Carmen Elenes-Fonseca, 41, of San Diego 
pleaded guilty to using interstate telephone lines in a plot to kill two 
prosecution witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, whose sons -- fugitive Vincent Walters, 23, and Martin Walters, 22 -- 
are suspects in the drug case, was also fined $8,000 by U.S. District Judge 
Earl B. Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom Ferraro said Tuesday that the women paid $5,000 to a 
man who was actually a police informant to kill two witnesses in the case. 
</P>
<P>
No murder attempt was made, as authorities had secretly videotaped the 
transaction. The sisters were arrested Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Walters' whereabouts remain unknown. He and his brother have been 
charged, along with 90 other people, with drug offenses stemming from a sting 
conducted in 1988 and 1989 by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, in 
which drug dealers were videotaped buying equipment at a DEA-operated store. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Walters also faces sentencing Nov. 15 for first-degree murder in the 
September, 1988, death of Kristine Reyes, 21.

FISHERMAN DIES AS BOAT CAPSIZES IN BAY; WAKE OF YACHT MAY HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego fisherman drowned when his boat capsized in San Diego Bay off 
Shelter Island Tuesday morning -- apparently after a luxury cabin cruiser had 
sped by, creating a formidable wake. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Corona, 64, of the 1700 block of Petra Drive, died after several 
attempts at resuscitation at the scene and at Sharp Cabrillo Hospital, the 
county medical examiner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
His boat, the 40- to 45-foot Chaser, was returning from a fishing trip, Harbor 
Police Sgt. Robert Irwin said. He said it flipped over in about 45 feet of 
water in the main ship channel about 300 yards south of Shelter Island, near 
buoy 16. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin said witnesses said the Chaser, as well as an 80-foot, white cabin 
cruiser, were headed into the bay, toward downtown, side by side. 
</P>
<P>
The witnesses said the wake from the bigger boat -- which they said was 
traveling at about 25 m.p.h. -- could have caused the Chaser to capsize. The 
witnesses said the cabin cruiser, which had gold lettering on its stern, 
continued down the bay without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin also said the witnesses, who were on shore, could not make out the name 
of the boat other than it ending in the word sea. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chaser, which witnesses said had been traveling about 5 m.p.h., 
rolled over, and very little was visible above water. 
</P>
<P>
"It virtually capsized to where the hull tucked over and rolled on its 
starboard side," Irwin said. 
</P>
<P>
A 41-foot U.S. Coast Guard rescue boat, which was within two minutes of the 
Chaser, immediately responded, Coast Guard Petty Officer Bill Driscoll said. 
</P>
<P>
Divers from the Harbor Police arrived shortly after, fighting to free Corona, 
who was trapped underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Once Corona was pulled onto the rescue boat, the divers performed 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Meanwhile, the boat's only other occupant, 
49-year-old Ben Storniolo of San Diego, swam away from the Chaser and was 
pulled from the water unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin said authorities did not find the boat the witnesses had described. "The 
description was real sketchy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the boat is located, he said, it's unclear whether the captain could be 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"We would need to determine if there was any negligence on his part," Irwin 
said. "According to witnesses (the captain of the cabin cruiser) might not even 
have been aware of what happened." 
</P>
<P>
According to Driscoll, there is no speed limit in the bay "per se, but you are 
responsible for the safe operation of your vessel." 
</P>
<P>
"People are responsible for any damage their wake puts up," Irwin added. Harbor 
Police are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday evening, the Harbor Police, who had been using flotation devices to try 
to raise the boat, said they will attempt it again today in conjunction with 
the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an effort, but they did not get it up all the way," Harbor Police Sgt. 
Sharon Bergan said. "Part of it is showing" above the water. 
</P>
<P>
She said authorities had not contacted any vessels thought to have been the 
cabin cruiser described by the witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We got some information they are going to follow up with" today, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the vessel capsized in the main shipping channel, Bergan said it would 
not be a cause of trouble for other ships navigating the passage Tuesday night 
and this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Where it is right now is over closer to the North Island. It's not as much of 
a hazard as it could be," she said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council asked its lawyers Tuesday to research whether there is a legal 
way the city can reactivate a request for waiver from federal requirements 
under the Clean Water Act, avoiding an expensive upgrading of the city sewage 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers plan to have the research done for a Nov. 1 hearing before U.S. 
District Judge Rudi Brewster, said Ted Bromfield, chief deputy city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the city and the federal government, San Diego is 
committed to building a system capable of secondary sewage treatment. Secondary 
treatment removes 90% of suspended solids from sewage. The city's advanced 
primary sewage treatment process now removes 80% of the solids from the waste 
before it is discharged into the ocean off Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
The city had temporary waivers from the act's requirements from 1981 through 
1986, but the city withdrew its application for a waiver in 1987 when the EPA 
indicated that the city's request would not be granted. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the EPA said he if not sure that San Diego will even be allowed 
to apply for a waiver now. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be legally impossible to reactivate a waiver at this late date," said 
Hugh Barroll, assistant regional counsel for the EPA in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the San Diego County Grand Jury released a resolution urging the 
city to back out of its January, 1990, acceptance of an EPA requirement for 
secondary treatment and renew its application for a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
The secondary treatment plant is estimated to cost as much as $2.8 billion by 
2003. Many scientists have said that secondary sewage treatment is unnecessary.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: FALLBROOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 8-year-old boy was killed Tuesday after being struck by a hit-and-run 
driver, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose identity was not released, was pronounced dead at the scene, CHP 
dispatcher Gary Kiger said. 
</P>
<P>
About 6:30 p.m., a black Mercedes-Benz with an antenna on the back hit the 
child on Orange Avenue between Kalmia Street and Mission Road. It is unclear 
where the child was standing when the car struck, Kiger said. 
</P>
<P>
The car was last seen on De Luz Road, and the CHP suspects his car might have 
sustained damage to its right front fender. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information is asked to call the CHP at 268-2276.

CITY OKS MOSQUE; IMPOSED CONDITIONS STIR GRUMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Council members approved the San Fernando Valley's first 
mosque Tuesday after requiring that the $1.8-million house of worship in 
Granada Hills have Spanish-style architecture, forgoing the traditional domes 
and minarets. 
</P>
<P>
In a 10-0 vote, the City Council approved the mosque but imposed so many 
conditions on its operations and construction that Valley Muslim leaders and 
their lobbyist, Robert Wilkinson, an ex-councilman, complained of prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think clearly there is a double standard being applied here," said Salam 
Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have to say there was some prejudice," said Wilkinson, who used to 
represent Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Hal Bernson, who now represents the area, denied any bias was 
shown by the council or the homeowners who opposed the mosque's construction. 
"I don't feel this was a matter of harassment or discrimination," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the main concern was the effect of traffic on the surrounding 
neighborhood of single-family homes, he told his council colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
All told, 44 conditions were imposed on the mosque. City officials earlier had 
said that it was the highest number of restrictions ever placed on a house of 
worship by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Mohiuddin, president of the Islamic Center of Northridge, said he was 
vexed over the style of architecture required by Bernson's office. 
</P>
<P>
The approved Spanish-style building -- stucco siding with red tile roof -- is 
"supposed to blend in with the neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a Greek church with a big dome, Catholic churches with towers," 
Mohiuddin said. "We don't want a big, elaborate dome, but maybe just a little 
one. Something that gives it an Islamic touch. So when you're driving down the 
118 (Simi Valley Freeway) you can say: 'That's the mosque.' " 
</P>
<P>
The 18,000-square-foot mosque, minus the towering minarets from which Muslim 
followers are traditionally called to worship, will be completed in six months 
to a year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major limitations bars the mosque from having more than 250 members 
during its first year of operation -- a number that could be increased to 400 
in the second year after a review by city planners. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley's Muslim community had sought permission for up to 550 members, 
Mohiuddin said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a growing community," Mohiuddin said in an interview. He estimated that 
there are about 6,000 Muslims in the Valley. Valley Muslims now worship at a 
converted three-bedroom house on Tampa Avenue in Northridge, and recently have 
been using a Knights of Columbus hall in Canoga Park to handle the overflow of 
worshipers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, worshipers are barred from parking on Encino Avenue, the street 
in front of the 2 1/2-acre mosque site. They are required to employ a "traffic 
control" officer to keep parishioners on Fridays -- the Muslim's holy day -- 
from making a right turn onto Encino Avenue when leaving the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
But the Granada Hills neighbors were not convinced that the conditions will be 
enforced. Nor were they happy with Bernson's vote. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner Preston Holland said he doubts that city officials will police the 
mosque to see that it is living up to the city's conditions and restrictions. 
"How do we get a good handle on the number of members of the church," he asked. 
"I'm sure I'd get sideways with the religious freedom issue if I try to find 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, Don Pardi, said the area already has eight traffic-generating 
churches or schools within a one-mile radius, including one church-run school 
and an adult school next door to the proposed mosque site. 
</P>
<P>
Urging homeowners to be tolerant, Wilkinson said the heaviest traffic would 
occur on Fridays from noon to 2 p.m., periods of normally light traffic in 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The former councilman noted that the Hillcrest Christian Church, located across 
the street from the mosque site, had recently sought to expand the enrollment 
of its school and "nobody from this community protested -- not one single 
protest." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tension, Bernson told longtime residents he believed the Muslims 
would be good neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Mohiuddin said, "There are so many damned restrictions. But we need a place to 
worship and so we accept them."

SAFETY: UNDERCOVER RTD OFFICERS DON UNIFORMS IN EFFORT TO DETER CRIME. FOOT 
PATROLS BEGIN ON BROADWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Armed with guns and nightsticks, a small number of blue-uniformed transit 
police are for the first time rubbing shoulders with passengers on RTD buses 
and in the busy downtown Broadway shopping district as officials attempt to 
persuade riders that the system is safer than they think. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing is believing," said Sharon Papa, chief of RTD police, as she stood a 
few feet from the Southern California Rapid Transit District's new -- and 
highly visible -- Broadway foot patrol. "We have historically deployed 
undercover officers, but people don't believe it. If they don't see them, they 
don't believe they're there. So we're really changing our mode of operation." 
</P>
<P>
Under a new program started experimentally three weeks ago and announced 
Tuesday by RTD officials, six uniformed officers are hopping buses and roaming 
up and down a crowded, eight-block stretch of downtown Broadway, which is the 
second-busiest bus corridor in the metropolitan area. About 15 more transit 
officers in uniform are riding RTD buses throughout Los Angeles County. "The 
idea is to get them on every bus within our service area, not just in high 
crime areas," Papa said. 
</P>
<P>
Reported crime throughout the sprawling regional bus system has flattened or 
declined slightly over the past three years, according to RTD, while arrests by 
transit police have gone up. Nonetheless, RTD General Manager Alan F. Pegg said 
the public continues to associate bus rides with crime. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers and merchants along Broadway welcomed the news that transit foot 
patrol police will be milling through the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nice. I like it," said 76-year-old Lydia Hernandez as she clutched a 
bus stop pole, a bag of just-purchased bananas at her feet. "I used to come to 
Broadway all the time. Now, just once in a while. There are a lot of winos and 
tramps." 
</P>
<P>
Raul, a clothing salesman who declined to give his last name, applauded the 
foot patrol as "beautiful. We need that. We really do. We thought we had it bad 
with the con artists. But we didn't know how good we had it until the drug 
dealers moved in." 
</P>
<P>
Stand in his Broadway store a few hours, Raul promised, and he can point out 
"who's peddling dope, who steals chains and who steals wallets." 
</P>
<P>
Every day, Roger Quinn catches a bus on Broadway to go to work. "I've seen it 
all," sighed Quinn, who lost a radio to thieves. "A couple of weeks ago, I saw 
a kid get his gold neck chain snatched and in the process he was stabbed." 
</P>
<P>
Miracle on Broadway, a nonprofit partnership of public and business interests 
laboring to revitalize Broadway, approached RTD about a foot patrol two years 
ago, executive director Estela Lopez said. With more than three-quarters of 
Broadway's shoppers arriving there by bus, the group argued that RTD has a 
stake in the district. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the RTD police department has doubled to 123 officers as the 
agency hired more police in anticipation of providing security on the new light 
rail system between downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach. RTD directors wound up 
contracting with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to police the rail 
line, freeing up officers for other assignments. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to tell the public they have a right to a safe ride," said RTD 
board President Nick Patsaouras at a press conference as buses roared by on 
Broadway. "We are doing very well, but we can do better." 
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year, 789 incidents -- mostly thefts and 
assaults -- were reported to transit police, compared to 826 for the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 1,374 crimes were reported. In 1988, there were 1,575 reported 
crimes, about 130 more than the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wilson, support services manager for the transit police, said that although 
the agency will continue using undercover officers on buses, more police will 
likely be put in uniform to "try to be more visible in the community and try to 
deter crime instead of just making arrests." 
</P>
<P>
Union officials representing RTD's 5,000 bus drivers support the new uniformed 
patrol. The union has expressed concern about another new RTD program that 
offers free rides to passengers if a bus is more than 15 minutes late. But they 
have no such qualms about this program. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's great," said Earl Clark, general chairman of the United 
Transportation Union. "We encourage the added (police) exposure." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the union is not planning any actions to protest the free-ride 
policy inaugurated Sept. 1, but will watch to see if drivers encounter any 
problems as a result of it. "I think it puts another responsibility on the 
driver," he said. "They work under extremely adverse conditions as it is."

MACARTHUR PARK PLAN WOULD LOCK OUT ADDICTS; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: BUSINESS OWNERS SEEK TO RID THE AREA OF DRUG USERS BY CLOSING OFF 
ALLEYS WITH GATES. THE PROPOSAL NEEDS APPROVAL OF CITY AGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of business owners led by City Councilwoman Gloria Molina has proposed 
erecting a series of locked gates along a dozen stretches of alleyway in the 
latest effort to rid the MacArthur Park area of up to 1,000 crack addicts and 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
The first gate could go up in a few weeks behind Botica del Pueblo pharmacy 
near the crime-plagued corner of Alvarado and 7th streets. 
</P>
<P>
"There are other gated alleys in the city, but nothing on the scale we are 
talking about," said Veronica Gutierrez, an aide to Molina, whose district 
includes the park. "About half the alleys within a three-block radius of the 
park would have gates and only the property owners, the Fire Department and the 
police would have the keys." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which some believe would save the city money otherwise spent on 
policing and cleaning the alleys, was hatched after a massive law enforcement 
crackdown earlier this year drove the drug addicts out of the 30-acre park and 
into the alleyways. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to keep up the pressure and this is an example of businesses and 
residents doing just that," Molina said. "We all have to look beyond our front 
doors to turn this area around." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would have to be approved by a number of city agencies including 
the City Council, the Department of Public Works, and Los Angeles Police and 
Fire departments, as well as property owners on both sides of an alley. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners along three alleyways already have agreed to install the gates. 
</P>
<P>
However, many questions remain unanswered about the plan to lock up the alleys. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it is not clear how many hours during the day they would remain 
locked, or who would pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
And no one can say whether the gates would do anything more than push the 
addicts into the bustling streets of the commercial area surrounding the park. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that the only recourse we have is to make life so uncomfortable for 
them that they move some place else is disappointing," said Tom Coyle, a 
spokesman for a group of business owners and residents called the Westlake Task 
Force. "But we are talking about hard core drug addicts here." 
</P>
<P>
"Where they will go after the gates go up should be answered by local, state 
and federal officials," added Maurice Hernandez, manager of the pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we can pay for their bus fare and shoot them out to Beverly Hills and 
UCLA," he quipped. "Then maybe a solution would come about." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a dozen crack smokers in a trash-strewn alley around the corner from 
his store did not seem too worried about the gates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think gates are a great idea," said one woman, after inhaling deeply from a 
small glass pipe. "I can climb just fine." 
</P>
<P>
"All they'll do is push us into the streets," muttered her male companion. 
</P>
<P>
But one homeless man living in a nearby alley sympathized with the business 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Our reality and their reality are two different things," he mused. "I think 
gates are a good idea, even though I don't know where the hell I'm going to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gutierrez believes that persuading dozens of hotel and shop owners 
in the area to agree to the plan will involve a "lot of footwork." 
</P>
<P>
"So far, the plan has met with a lot of support," Gutierrez said. "If a 
property owner requires a particular alley for public access, of course, we 
can't put a gate up there." 
</P>
<P>
Norm Langer, owner of the landmark Langer's Restaurant, however, feared that 
the gates would "hinder police from doing their sweeps in the alleys." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he said, "There are fire escapes and emergency exits back there -- 
what are you going to do, trap people in the alleys?" 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Department Battalion Chief Michael Ambarian said gates would 
have to be approved "on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
"If an alley is gated at a street entrance, that doesn't create a problem," 
Ambarian said. "Our main concern is that people can get out of buildings to a 
safe area." 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said a group of representatives from Molina's office expects to 
present the plan to police officials later this week.

FGS DEFENDS ITSELF AS STATE SEEKS TO REVOKE ITS LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FGS Insurance Agency, which provides car insurance for nearly 200,000 
Californians, labeled state Department of Insurance accusations that it engaged 
in fraudulent sales practices as "absurd" Tuesday at the outset of a hearing on 
revocation of the company's license. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing in Los Angeles before Administrative Law Judge Robert A. Neher will 
determine whether state Insurance Commissioner Roxani M. Gillespie can revoke 
Irvine-based FGS's license. 
</P>
<P>
The state alleges that FGS engaged in a series of fraudulent activities, 
including misusing the beleaguered assigned risk plan, falsifying drivers' 
records, hiding commissions and fees, and failing to disclose that it was being 
paid $20 per applicant by finance companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The commissioner's accusation is a tawdry grab-bag of allegations that invokes 
repealed statutes, misstates crucial facts and misconstrues the public 
interest," said FGS attorney Milford W. Dahl Jr. in his opening statement 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The company has denied the accusations and last week filed a lawsuit against 
the state Department of Insurance, asking for a court order to stop what it 
said was harassment. FGS said department investigators entered company offices 
without permission and harassed customers there. 
</P>
<P>
"In its zeal to nail FGS, the Department of Insurance has lied to the public," 
Dahl said as the department's hearings got under way. "The department has used 
a sloppy, dishonest investigation to cover up its own inefficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
The probe of FGS follows a larger state investigation into Coastal Insurance 
Co., one of California's largest writers of high-risk auto liability insurance 
policies before it filed for bankruptcy in February, 1989. Coastal once owned 
FGS, whose officials claim that the action against the company is a vendetta 
for the $66 million that Coastal's collapse will cost California consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Insurance spokeswoman Carey Fletcher denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"We did an excellent and thorough job, and the department is proceeding in a 
timely manner because we have a good case," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the state's biggest complaints against FGS is that it put almost all of 
its automobile liability insurance through the California Automobile Assigned 
Risk Plan, which was intended for drivers whose driving records are sp bad that 
they cannot get insurance anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Dahl said the department has focused on FGS to divert attention from widespread 
criticism of its performance in regulating the state's auto insurance business, 
including the deficit-ridden assigned risk plan, which has proposed a 160% rate 
hike so it can break even. 
</P>
<P>
Dahl argued that putting FGS out of business would only worsen California's 
insurance situation. "Revoking FGS's license inevitably would lead some of 
these drivers to drop their coverage, thereby exacerbating the uninsured driver 
crisis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Farmers Insurance Group agent Dan Mills testified that he had at 
least one client cancel insurance because the client said he could get a 
cheaper policy with FGS through the assigned risk plan. Mills filed a complaint 
against FGS with the Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
David E. Kuizenga, head of Western Assn. Automobile Insurance Plans, which 
oversees the state's assigned risk plan, testified Tuesday that about 50% of 
Californians enrolled in the assigned risk plan had perfect driving records. He 
said FGS was not the only agency putting good drivers into the program. 
</P>
<P>
But FGS did this more than any other company, the state said, accounting for 
141,000 of the 1.2 million drivers enrolled in 1989. The company with the 
next-highest number of clients enrolled had 29,000. 
</P>
<P>
The state charges that FGS urged applicants to falsely claim that they had 
tried unsuccessfully to get automobile insurance in California in the last 60 
days, a requirement of the assigned risk plan. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the state says FGS was engaging in a practice known as "sliming." 
</P>
<P>
"Sliming was a practice whereby customer application records would be falsified 
so that people would qualify for insurance," according to a report about FGS 
that was recently released by the state Assembly. "Many extremely bad drivers 
had their accident records and values of their cars misstated by the agents 
into the computer system so as to permit the booking of many policies that 
would otherwise be rejected." 
</P>
<P>
For example, $40,000 cars were classified as $20,000 autos, a person with three 
accidents and two moving violations was listed as having no accidents, and a 
Corvette was listed as a Chevette. 
</P>
<P>
Once an insurance sale was made, the agents were able to claim a commission on 
12 months of payments, even though only one month was paid for, the state 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
Besides abusing the assigned risk plan, the state charges that FGS failed to 
inform customers that they had to pay interest rates ranging from 21% to 40.75% 
on premiums.

BILL BOYARSKY: L.A., LET MAGNOLIA BE MAGNOLIA

"Look Out Melrose! Magnolia Boulevard Is on the Way." 
</P>
<P>
That arresting slogan on a bus stop sign in North Hollywood advertises one of 
the more controversial civic face-lifts ever undertaken by Mayor Tom Bradley, 
the Los Angeles City Council and the Community Redevelopment Agency. If the 
city succeeds, the San Fernando Valley's dowdy old Magnolia Boulevard will be 
transformed into another Melrose Avenue, L.A.'s world famous street of funky 
and smart shops, restaurants and theaters. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood business people and property owners dreamed up the idea more 
than a decade ago. Government, they said, should step in and clean up the 
slums. Councilman Joel Wachs took up their cause and pushed the North Hollywood 
Redevelopment Project through the council. 
</P>
<P>
It's not cheap. Last year, the CRA spent $44 million to buy land, subsidize 
developers' construction projects, draw up plans and pay bureaucrats' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
And not everyone thinks North Hollywood is blighted. 
</P>
<P>
Take Eddie Searles, who does occasional work as a movie stuntman, even though 
he's long past his 70th birthday. The back closet of his house, near Magnolia, 
is filled with costumes and vintage clothes. The yard is littered with old cars 
and motorcycles. Hire Eddie's car, motorcycle or costumes and you also get 
Eddie as a stuntman. He shares the house with his wife, Othelia, who makes 
wigs. They also raise a few chickens. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA wants their lot for a shopping center. The agency offered the Searles 
$232,000. If they don't accept the offer, the CRA has said it will force them 
to sell, using its powers of eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
"If I lose the place, it kills me," Searles said as we sat in his front room 
several days ago. ". . . I couldn't get a place like this for $232,000." 
</P>
<P>
The CRA says that the Searles and a few other dissenters are a minority. As 
evidence, they cite continued votes of confidence from something called the 
Project Area Committee. Residents elect these 25-member committees in 
redevelopment areas to give the CRA grass-roots advice. 
</P>
<P>
Searles and the other dissidents contend that the North Hollywood Project Area 
rigs its elections and is dominated by the North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. 
"I went to vote and presented my drivers' license," one property owner told me. 
"I always have presented my driver's license (to prove eligibility to vote). 
This time, they said they needed my tax bills and utility bills." 
</P>
<P>
Two city council members, Richard Allatore and Gloria Molina, have promised to 
look into the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
What the council members fear is that there might not be support for the 
redevelopment project. And without that support, a fundamental question arises: 
Why redevelop Magnolia Boulevard at all? 
</P>
<P>
I walked down the Valley's Melrose-to-be Monday. I parked nearby on Lankershim 
Boulevard, in front of a plain one-story building housing the West Coast 
Detectives World Headquarters. It was obvious what the CRA and the business 
people envision for Magnolia. A tall, sleek CRA-sponsored office, hotel and 
apartment complex that will include the home of the Academy of Television Arts 
and Science that already is being built. Farther on is Magnolia Towers, a CRA 
low-rent development for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Magnolia, though, Western Surplus was selling guns, ammo and clothes -- 
nothing more fashionable than L.A. Gear shoes. Down the street was the Survival 
Store, which displayed in its window such books as "The Art Of Getting Even -- 
The Do It Yourself Justice Manual," "Combat: House to House," and "Hardcore 
Poaching." Down the street were the North Hollywood Billiards Parlor and three 
stores selling used clothes. A few doors away was T-Wheels &amp; Deals, 
advertising tires as low as $1.85. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the real Melrose Avenue wasn't so chic a few years ago. Then 
interior decorator shops moved east from West Hollywood into Los Angeles. 
Clothing shops and restaurants followed. Melrose Avenue redeveloped itself, or 
at least private enterprise did. No tax dollars were needed. 
</P>
<P>
The point is, these neighborhood transformations sometimes just happen 
naturally in cities. And they work better that way. Melrose Avenue is more fun 
than the CRA's downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Leave Magnolia alone, and the fashionable people may someday discover Kathy's 
Vintages and Razamataz, a second-hand clothing store. And nearby, that small 
used book store on Lankershim may yet attract the literati. 
</P>
<P>
And until that happens, Magnolia Boulevard will still be of value. Where else 
can you buy a tire for $1.85?

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FATHER'S ARRAIGNMENT SET IN STRANGLING OF 
INFANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sept. 17 arraignment was set Tuesday for a Rowland Heights divinity student 
accused of strangling his 3-month-old son while his wife was at work. 
</P>
<P>
Chong Kuk Park, 30, was arrested Sunday and charged with the first-degree 
murder of his son after an autopsy revealed that the infant had been battered 
and strangled, Los Angeles Sheriff's Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Park, who emigrated from South Korea five months ago and is a graduate divinity 
student at a school in Whittier, last Wednesday took the lifeless boy to his 
wife's San Gabriel Valley office, Sgt. Stanley White said. 
</P>
<P>
The wife alerted authorities, who initially suspected the child was a victim of 
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. But after they interviewed Park and read the 
autopsy report, he was charged with murder and was being held in Los Angeles 
County Jail without bail.

FARRELL SEEKS REVIEW OF GATES' DRUG USER REMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell said Tuesday that he has asked the 
Police Commission to review Police Chief Daryl Gates' statement last week that 
casual drug users "ought to be taken out and shot." 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to call him on that," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where we get to the question of who really runs the Police 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said the commission, a five-member civilian board appointed by the 
mayor, has ultimate authority over the department and should take a stand on 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Gates first made the statement last Wednesday at a Senate hearing in Washington 
and reaffirmed it two days later when questioned by reporters in Los Angeles. 
"Yeah! I mean it," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell's is the first official request that Gates be called to task for the 
remarks. Mayor Tom Bradley refused to comment on the controversy last week and 
has left for a three-week trip to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Police Commission, Farrell said: "The words are shocking, 
the thoughts behind them are troublesome." 
</P>
<P>
Gates' statement may encourage police officers to "push the limits of their 
authority," Farrell said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
However, Farrell added that he believes Gates is "an able administrator" who 
warrants "praise and commendation." 
</P>
<P>
"But Chief Gates should be called to task for his recent statements," Farrell 
wrote. "If the chief of police can say . . . casual drug users should be shot 
to death, then any police officer on the force can make similar statements. 
That is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach Police Commission members late Tuesday were unsuccessful.

In a development that could result in the suppression of a key piece of 
evidence in a criminal case against Los Angeles police officers in the 
so-called "39th and Dalton Incident," a former police supervisor testified 
Tuesday that he improperly agreed to distort a report to reward an officer for 
disclosing where the evidence was hidden. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony by Enrique Hernandez, Officer Charles Wilson was told 
that "things would go badly" for him if he refused to cooperate with 
investigators looking into the possibility that officers -- rather than gang 
members, as police contended -- had nearly demolished four residences on Aug. 
1, 1988, while ostensibly looking for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez also testified at the evidentiary hearing that Wilson was told he had 
no choice but to tell police internal affairs investigators where he had hidden 
a battering ram allegedly used to do much of the damage because he had to obey 
orders from higher ranking officers. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez's testimony was an attempt by Wilson's lawyer to show that his client 
was coerced into turning over the ram. The lawyer said that such coercion would 
be improper and Municipal Judge Larry Paul Fidler would have to withhold 
knowledge of the ram's existence from the jury in the upcoming trial of Wilson 
and three colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution believes the ram is the strongest evidence linking police to 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden, during his questioning of Hernandez, 
tried to show that the former lieutenant's testimony cannot be trusted because 
he practices law with a lawyer who represents one of Wilson's co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Darden played for Fidler a tape of an interview of 
Hernandez with police internal affairs investigators a month after the raids in 
the 3900 block of Dalton Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
In that interview, Hernandez did not mention as he did Tuesday that he promised 
Wilson, in exchange for his cooperation, that a police report would omit the 
fact that Wilson "had to be talked into giving up the ram." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and the other three officers are the only members of the LAPD against 
whom criminal charges have been filed, even though more than 80 officers took 
part in the raid and 38 of them subsequently were ordered by the Police 
Department to face disciplinary actions. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson along with Capt. Thomas D. Elfmont, Sgt. Charles (Ted) Spicer and 
Officer Todd Parrick are charged with misdemeanor vandalism and conspiracy to 
commit vandalism. Wilson also is charged with obstructing and delaying the 
police investigation because he allegedly stashed the homemade, hand-held 
battering ram in a manhole after learning that the raid would be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing on the admissibility of the ram is scheduled to resume today with a 
ruling by Fidler likely before the end of the day.

CHAVEZ ARRESTED IN GRAPE SALES PROTEST; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: VONS SUPERMARKET OFFICIALS ADMIT THAT THE UFW LEADER'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST 
USE OF PESTICIDE ON THE FRUIT HAS DAMAGED BUSINESS. 
</P>

<P>
In a carefully orchestrated protest over pesticide use on grapes, United Farm 
Workers leader Cesar Chavez, two of his school-age granddaughters and nine 
other supporters were arrested Tuesday in Montebello after defying a court 
order to stop picketing Vons markets. 
</P>
<P>
Against a backdrop of about 90 chanting farm-union activists and a throng of 
media cameras, the longtime labor leader was led to a police van by an officer 
who told him he was breaking the law through his protest. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand," Chavez told the officer softly in Spanish. "I am ready." 
</P>
<P>
Watching the scene unfold, Vons executives acknowledged for the first time that 
the UFW's prolonged picketing of their area stores has hurt table grape sales 
-- although they would not say by how much. They said they saw no choice but to 
seek Chavez's arrest -- or risk further disruption of business and "harassment" 
of their customers. 
</P>
<P>
"We sell groceries; we sell what the customers want," said Robert P. 
Bermingham, senior vice president at Vons Cos. Inc., who asserted that company 
tests have shown the grapes to be safe. "We are just sorry we got caught in 
between Cesar Chavez's fight with the growers and the pesticide people." 
</P>
<P>
The protest marked an escalation in the UFW's most recent, 10-week-old, 
campaign over the grape issue, as farm worker leaders battle not only 
pesticide-using grape growers and the stores that buy and sell their products, 
but the judicial system as well. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephen O'Neil issued a 
temporary restraining order against the UFW, instructing union members to stop 
protesting, leafletting or standing near a Vons store in a way that could be 
seen as intimidating to customers or employees. 
</P>
<P>
Since late June, dozens of UFW members and supporters have been picketing, 
chanting through bullhorns and handing out literature at eight area Vons 
outlets, including Vons' Latino-oriented subsidiary, Tianguis, to voice their 
claims that the pesticides used by grape growers pose a cancer threat. Vons, 
which the UFW says backed out of a 1989 pledge to stop selling the 
pesticide-tainted grapes, was targeted as the biggest Southland seller. 
</P>
<P>
As Chavez prepared to march on the Tianguis store on Whittier Boulevard in 
Montebello on Tuesday morning, he labeled O'Neil's order a "ridiculous" 
infringement of his 1st Amendment rights and "the broadest injunction in my 40 
years of struggle." 
</P>
<P>
"How can they tell me I don't have a right to tell people not to buy 
groceries?" he demanded. "It's sad to see justice controlled by a food chain 
store." 
</P>
<P>
While about 90 UFW members and supporters paraded on the sidewalk outside the 
market, brandishing signs and chanting "Hey hey, ho ho, poisoned grapes have 
got to go!" Chavez and 11 others marched right in front of the store. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 police officers, who had been notified of the demonstration by the 
union on Monday, awaited their arrival, arresting them as they began their 
picketing. None resisted arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm trying to do is to save the children out there who are dying of 
cancer because of these pesticides," UFW volunteer Sandy Martinez said minutes 
before her arrest. "This is something we have to do. We have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
Two of Chavez's granddaughters-turned-activists, ages 12 and 14, were released 
to their parents without being cited. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez and the other nine adult protesters were freed from the Montebello 
police station early Tuesday afternoon, with bail waived. They were ordered to 
reappear in court at a later date to face misdemeanor charges of violating the 
picketing ban. A second offense could bring a felony charge. 
</P>
<P>
It was Chavez's first arrest in connection with a farm-related cause since the 
1970s, UFW officials said. He tried to get arrested in a demonstration at a 
Texas grocery last month, but police balked and let the protest continue, the 
officials said.

A QUESTION OF COLOR; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY DA DRAWS VERY FINE LINE IN PARKING LOT ASSAULT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being a person of color can be a health hazard in American society. That point 
has come dramatically home to Southern California in recent weeks as the 
investigation into the horrible attack on a 15-year-old Orange County girl in a 
parking lot plodded to a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the district attorney filed assault and weapons charges, but what has 
anybody learned? 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Sheriff's Department and district attorney certainly cannot 
be accused of having rushed to judgment. 
</P>
<P>
It took the outrage of the region's entire civil rights community before 
sheriff's investigators reversed themselves and acknowledged a racial dimension 
in forwarding their recommendation to the district attorney. This, despite the 
fact that a number of witnesses said the attack was fueled by the racial 
insults by whites against blacks. 
</P>
<P>
But in issuing its complaints Tuesday on both sides of the fight, the district 
attorney's office decided to leave out any of the hate-crime charges from the 
sheriff's investigation. It reasoned that racial hatred was not the cause for 
the fight, even though racial epithets were uttered during the course of it. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney has the difficult responsibility of presenting a provable 
case, but to say that race was a component of a fight but not the cause draws a 
very fine line. Amber Jefferson's family -- her white mother and black father 
-- and civil rights activists have questioned the assertion of law-enforcement 
officials all along that the race question was so complex. 
</P>
<P>
Their argument that blacks have to meet a special standard of justice may not 
be put to rest by the district attorney's reasoning. And images of Amber's 
face, ripped open by a piece of glass, may linger long in the public's mind. 
</P>
<P>
These kinds of incidents may well reoccur as the region becomes increasingly 
multicultural. And to conduct such investigations credibly, all area 
law-enforcement agencies must send unequivocal signals that they intend to root 
out bigotry.

LOS ANGELES RAISES PARKING FEES, BUSINESS TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Aug. 29 Metro section you reported: 
</P>
<P>
1) "Council OKs Hike in Tax on Businesses" 
</P>
<P>
2) "LAX Parking Fees to Increase Again" 
</P>
<P>
When will this taxation stop? Recently, every time I pick up a publication, 
higher taxes are being reported. 
</P>
<P>
Will 1990 be known as the year of "gouge the taxpayers to death"? 
</P>
<P>
I will vote against every incumbent currently in office. I will encourage 
family, friends and co-workers to do the same. We must begin to live within our 
means -- including local, state and federal governments!

SERVING DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My first letter to the editor was to the New York Post back in 1948. My high 
school journalism teacher made it an assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred published letters later, I realized that one role of the 
citizen in a democracy is the ability to directly address an issue to a 
newspaper, a legislator or even the President. I have written to every 
President since Harry Truman. Some have responded. 
</P>
<P>
Talk-show hosts encourage people to call in. Likewise, when people make their 
views known, democracy is better served. In the recent Letters sections, The 
Times has published the numbers of letters received on current topics. The 
Sunday issue on the Persian Gulf (Aug. 25) indicated about 700 letters had been 
received on this subject. Considering there are more than a million readers, 
that is still a small number. 
</P>
<P>
That hardly reflects the ability of the public to make its views known. It 
takes a few minutes, a postage stamp, an envelope and stationery. And when 
done, you'll feel a lot better.

YOUNG ADULTS' INABILITY TO BUY OWN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kudos to Robert Kuttner ("The Great Generational Depression," Commentary, Sept. 
3) and the few other souls in the (economic) wilderness for pointing out a 
recent American phenomenon: the hard fact that a young family, by itself, will 
never be able to own their own home. 
</P>
<P>
Kuttner cites some (all too familiar to me) data, but what impressed me the 
most was his theory: that the reason why "the political system is paying so 
little attention to this remarkable generational economic distress . . . is 
because the distress has yet to reach the opinion-leader class in a serious 
way." 
</P>
<P>
The fact today is that if you're young, and don't have a great deal of personal 
wealth, or at least parents of means, then the only way you're gonna own a home 
is to be a highly paid professional -- at least $65,000 a year. Then marry a 
similar young professional and combine your incomes toward the purchase of your 
home. You may be able to afford a small place in a not-too-objectionable part 
of town. And whatever you do, don't make the mistake of having children! This 
will put one-half of the mortgage-paying team out of commission for several 
critical months! I mean, what do you want, a family or a home? 
</P>
<P>
You tell the older generation this, and they'll never believe you. If you ask 
the government for help, you are sent a list of no-money-down fixer-uppers. My 
parents nod in sympathy, but, you see, they're financially strapped because of 
that condo in Maui.

COOL RHETORIC BUT CAREFUL POLICY; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH WORKS TO KEEP THE CONSENSUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No matter how hard he tries, President George Bush will never go down in 
history as the great communicator. 
</P>
<P>
He just doesn't have it. He lacks that fire and brimstone, that poetic flair, 
that determination to sink his rhetorical teeth into the emotions of his 
audience and drag them this way and then that. 
</P>
<P>
What a good thing, really. 
</P>
<P>
For what one heard and saw in his address to a joint session of Congress 
Tuesday night was that sensible and thoughtful George Bush who might manage 
America and its allies out of the gulf crisis and into a world with one less 
Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The speech was addressed to the issue of the federal budget impasse as well as 
the gulf crisis. And there will be some rancor over his budget comments. 
</P>
<P>
But the characteristics that in his speech seemed so definitively George Bush 
-- the reasonableness, the willingness to listen, the intelligence -- might 
very well prove to be defining qualities of his mainly pragmatic foreign policy 
that continue to attract friend and former foe alike. 
</P>
<P>
For U.S. objectives in the gulf, Bush listed the obvious: Iraqi withdrawal from 
Kuwait, the return of Kuwait's emir government to power, security and stability 
in the gulf region and protection of American citizens abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Not many Americans will quarrel with these goals, though some will want more 
(the overthrow of Saddam Hussein) and others something different (the 
substitution of supervised elections and a new democratic government for the 
exiled emir). But in characteristic fashion, Bush splits the difference and 
goes for the consensus. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was obviously proud of the recently concluded instant summit in Helsinki 
when, referring to the joint communique with President Gorbachev, he said: 
"Clearly, no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie 
concerted U.N. action against aggression." 
</P>
<P>
The President added: "We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The 
crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity 
to move forward toward an era of historic cooperation. Out of these troubled 
times . . . a new world order can emerge . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In the past that sort of presidential rhetoric would have been regarded as 
little more than mundane window dressing. 
</P>
<P>
But in this post-Cold War epoch, anything is possible -- the good as well as 
the bad. Optimism is no less realistic than pessimism. 
</P>
<P>
The George Bush style -- on the slow side, on the cautious side, on the 
consensus side, on the pragmatic side -- is probably what is needed to maintain 
the international and domestic consensus on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
It can also help reinforce a nascent process of collective security that might 
just possibly work to achieve the containment and resolution of the next big 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Give the President some due. The gulf crisis is far from over, and there is 
danger at every turn. But the dimension of the consensus against Iraq is 
attributable not only to Saddam Hussein's basic ferocity but also to George 
Bush's basic intelligence.9/12/90

FOR MOST OF US, THE NO. 1 ISSUE IS NO BIG DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: IT'S DOWN IN CALIFORNIA, BUT THE POLITICIANS STILL FIND IT AN EASY 
ATTENTION-GETTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WALTERS, Dan Walters is a political columnist for the Sacramento Bee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A monumental paradox has surfaced in this election season: While polls and 
other measures of public sentiment indicate ever-rising levels of concern about 
crime -- and coincidental levels of support for more laws and more cops and 
prisons -- Californians' actual chances of being victims of crime have been 
declining rather markedly. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, the Department of Justice issued, with little official fanfare and 
equally scant media interest, a thick report on crime in California during the 
1980s. During the decade, the California Crime Index -- the number of serious 
crimes per 100,000 population -- decreased sharply from nearly 4,000 in 1980 to 
less than 3,500 in 1989, even counting an upward bump in the last two years of 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
While the actual number of crimes may have increased, that has been offset by 
the state's huge population growth during the period, roughly 6 million. In 
other words, crime grew more slowly than population; or, to say it still 
another way, one's statistical chances of becoming a crime victim decreased. 
</P>
<P>
During that same period, moreover, the "clearance rate" for crimes increased by 
14%, although only about 22% of all major crimes were being cleared by arrest 
or other actions. And, as everyone knows, the number of criminals being locked 
up has escalated sharply. 
</P>
<P>
If relatively fewer crimes are being committed, more are being solved and more 
felons are going to jail, that should be cause for great celebration. We should 
be congratulating ourselves that all of those additional laws and billions of 
tax dollars are having a major impact. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, are Californians more, not less, concerned about crime? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the decrease in crime is a big secret, one that the crime 
industry wants to keep locked away. Think of the hundreds of thousands of cops, 
lawyers, judges, prison guards, prison builders, gun and lock merchants, 
insurance agents, burglar alarm installers and others whose incomes depend on 
crime. Even the military wants to get in on the crime-fighting trade these days 
as its main reason for being, the Soviet Union, becomes a pussycat. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among those who engage in the conspiracy of silence about crime are 
politicians. Contemporary political campaigns consist of identifying supposed 
threats to the welfare of voters and then promising to oppose them effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Bombarded by real and fictional crimes daily through the media, we become more 
acutely sensitive to incidents from our own lives and thus become utterly 
convinced that waves of crime are threatening to inundate us. 
</P>
<P>
Crime is, in fact, a very serious matter in some inner-city neighborhoods. But 
for most Californians, it is a minor annoyance at most, certainly not something 
that should preoccupy their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The danger is that politicians will continue to dwell on crime for tactical 
reasons, not only contributing to the irrational climate of fear, but also 
neglecting policy issues that are fundamentally more important to the state's 
future.

3,000-ACRE BLAZE NEAR ESCONDIDO ALMOST ENCIRCLED; EVACUEES RETURNING; 
</P>
<P>
BRUSH FIRE: TWO HUNDRED WERE FORCED TO FLEE CANYON RESIDENCES. FIVE HOMES WERE 
BADLY DAMAGED.

<P>
A 3,000-acre brush fire west of Escondido, believed to have been caused by 
illegal target shooting, was nearly encircled by 600 firefighters late Tuesday, 
as evacuated residents went back to their blackened canyon of posh houses. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. A.D. Hill of the California Department of Forestry predicted that the 
blaze, which forced about 200 residents to flee and seriously damaged five 
homes, would be extinguished by 8 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters still battled hot spots Tuesday, one of which started when a rat 
caught fire and ran east of Del Dios Highway, torching brush perilously close 
to the hamlet of Del Dios. 
</P>
<P>
With each outbreak, helicopters quickly swooped down on nearby Lake Hodges, 
filling huge buckets with water and conducting air strikes on the burning 
brush. 
</P>
<P>
"Any one of those hot spots, the wind can kick up and blow it down on the 
lake," said Ken Rice, a battalion chief with the San Diego Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, fire crews were trying to contain as much of the remaining blaze as 
possible, while worrying that a shift in the wind could carry the flames 
northwest into the Harmony Grove area of Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
With low humidity and the temperature 95 degrees in the shade, conditions were 
"less than ideal" for battling a fire, Hills said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to hit it as hard as we can as early as we can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the fire began rapidly moving along Mt. Israel Road on Monday afternoon, 
fire officials ordered people to leave their canyon homes. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 of them took refuge for the night with friends or relatives and 100 
others stayed in a Red Cross shelter set up at Del Dios Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Somohano of the Red Cross said that while many refugees returned to their 
homes Tuesday afternoon, they were expected back in the shelter Tuesday night 
because water, telephone and electrical service had not yet been restored in 
the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The people who ventured back to their homes were sad but generally grateful the 
damage was not worse. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Saatjian, his hair matted with sweat, busily inspected his rose-growing 
operation, bemoaning the loss of about 15,000 bushes, a third of his plants. 
Seven of his eight greenhouses were damaged, along with his office. He 
estimated the damage at about $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Saatjian's main concern was fixing the water pipes around his property in 
hopes of saving the rest of his roses. 
</P>
<P>
"The roses are very dry, whatever is left of them," he said. "They need water 
but the line is burned around the perimeter." 
</P>
<P>
Because insurance is so expensive, "you're pretty much on your own," he said, 
so he simply plans to begin again. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no choice; we have to pull together and rebuild," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another canyon resident, John Love, returned to find that fire had burned all 
the way around his house, but stayed about 10 feet away from the structure. 
</P>
<P>
Then he learned that Jim Bell, a 29-year-old bulldozer operator who was working 
on a recreational project when he saw the fire approach, had swung into action 
and cut a fire break around Love's home. 
</P>
<P>
"He went up there like John Wayne," said Love. "He saved my home." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who stayed up all night and most of Tuesday helping, said, "I was just 
trying to save people's houses. I've worked up here and these are good folks. I 
wasn't trying to be a hero, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials have no total damage estimate and no suspects in the fire, which 
Hill blamed on target shooting nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand it was a high-powered weapon of some type," he said. He 
speculated that the spark from the muzzle may have ignited the blaze.

ZOLTAN ROZSNYAI: CONDUCTOR, UNIVERSITY MUSIC DIRECTOR 
</P>

<P>
Zoltan Rozsnyai, United States International University music director and 
conductor of the school's International Orchestra, died in his sleep at his 
home here early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
He was 64; death was attributed to a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Budapest, Hungary, Rozsnyai first came to international attention as 
founder and conductor of the Philharmonia Hungarica in 1956. That was shortly 
after he fled to Austria during Hungary's failed revolution that year. Rozsnyai 
recruited fellow refugees for his orchestra, based in Vienna. The Philharmonia 
Hungarica toured Europe and North America and recorded extensively for the next 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rozsnyai made his U.S. debut in December, 1956, as guest conductor with the 
Minneapolis Symphony. He became an American citizen in 1967, the same year he 
accepted the post of San Diego Symphony music director. Under his leadership 
the local orchestra achieved full professional status, and he conducted the 
orchestra's first commercial recording on the Vox label. He resigned as music 
director in 1971, citing frustrations over funding and excessive competition 
from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which played several dates a year in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
After the San Diego Symphony's executive committee tried to extend his 
retirement date to 1972, many of his musicians threatened to resign, saying 
they lacked confidence in his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Retired violist Joseph Wagner of Chula Vista, who joined the San Diego Symphony 
in 1954, recalled that Rozsnyai "was ambitious in attempting difficult larger 
works and helped the orchestra to grow." 
</P>
<P>
In 1977 he was to found a Golden State Opera company in Los Angeles but the 
project never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1984, Rozsnyai was music director of the Knoxville Symphony, where 
he led the orchestra's participation in the 1982 World's Fair. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he was recruited to develop USIU's International Orchestra, a 50-piece 
ensemble made up of young professional players recruited for a two-year 
graduate program in orchestra performance. Most of the members -- who are not 
paid but receive room and board and earn master's degrees -- have come from the 
People's Republic of China, with a smattering of European and North American 
students filling out their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
The International Orchestra made its debut in La Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium in 
June, 1987. During the academic year, Rozsnyai led the orchestra in monthly 
concerts in La Jolla, downtown San Diego's Lyceum Theatre and the San Diego 
College Avenue Baptist Church. Among the soloists who played with the 
International Orchestra were Ilse von Alpenheim, Gustavo Romero and Anthony 
Newman, who premiered his piano concerto with the group. 
</P>
<P>
Rozsnyai is survived by his wife, Alyze Dreiling, International Orchestra 
concertmaster, whom he married a year ago. They had one daughter, Alyze 
Francesca. He is also survived by three other daughters, a son and four 
grandchildren from other marriages.

Butte County supervisors asked Gov. George Deukmejian for an additional $8 
million in state aid, declaring again that their only alternative would be to 
file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's press secretary, Bob Gore, said the Republican governor would have 
no comment on the county's request until his fiscal advisers review it. Butte's 
letter is a counter to Deukmejian's proposal last week to give the county $7.45 
million in state aid if it cut an additional $6.65 million to close an 
estimated $14.1-million gap in its proposed $155-million budget. That offer 
from Deukmejian came just a few hours before the county was scheduled to become 
the first in the nation to file for bankruptcy.

SLOPPY PLAY COSTS CSUN IN VOLLEYBALL LOSS TO UCSB 
</P>

<P>
UC Santa Barbara middle blocker Julie Pitois expected to go five games with Cal 
State Northridge on Tuesday night. But the Matadors weren't up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
A combination of poor serve-receiving and attacking on the Northridge side led 
to a 15-10, 15-8, 7-15, 15-5 Santa Barbara win. The Gauchos, ranked No. 7 by 
Volleyball Monthly magazine, improved to 8-1 and the home team fell to 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge made a season-high 35 attack errors. 
</P>
<P>
"We took their outside hitters out of the game with a good block," UCSB Coach 
Kathy Gregory said. "They have a very good setter and one of the best middle 
attacks I've seen. Their middle is so good that we decided to leave only one 
blocker on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
The ploy worked on the outside, but CSUN setter Beth Welch and middle hitters 
Kathleen Dixon and Marianne Dixon dazzled the Gauchos with quick hits, 
off-balance dinks and tomahawk spikes. Welch had 47 assists and Kathleen Dixon 
put away a season-high 18 kills. Sister Marianne had nine kills. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a setter, that's the driving force and they have that," Gregory said. 
"They're not ranked, but they can play with any Top 20 team." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors fell behind, 7-2, in the first game, but after a timeout and an 
exchange of points, they pulled within 11-10. Following a CSUN error, Tina Van 
Loon took over the serve for UCSB and the Gauchos scored three straight points 
on kills by Maria Reyes and Kristie Ryan and a CSUN hitting error. After four 
consecutive sideouts, UCSB won, 15-10, on a dink by Ryan off the serve. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN kept pace with the Gauchos in the second game -- to a point. With the 
score tied, 7-7, UCSB scored the next seven points en route to a 15-8 triumph. 
</P>
<P>
In the third game, CSUN built a 9-4 lead, reeled off three straight points for 
a 12-4 advantage and finished with a flurry of three straight points on a UCSB 
error, an ace by Welch and a kill by Kathleen Dixon for a 15-7 win. 
</P>
<P>
UCSB built an 8-3 lead in the fourth game and after a CSUN timeout, scored six 
more for a 14-3 advantage. CSUN managed two points, then lost match point.

PAEZ ACCEPTS BASKETBALL POST AT L. A. BANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three months after he resigned as a coach and teacher with the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, former Cleveland High basketball Coach Marc Paez is 
back doing both -- at Banning High in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
Paez, 30, who left Cleveland in June after leading the Cavaliers to a 21-6 
record and into the City Section 4-A Division semifinals in his only season 
with the team, was hired last week. 
</P>
<P>
Paez, who cited external distractions and the pressure to win at Cleveland as 
prime reasons for resigning, said he does not expect to have such problems at 
Banning. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, time will tell, but I suspect that it'll be closer to what I hope 
to find at the high school level," Paez said. "I anticipate less off-the-court 
distractions. It should be closer to what I think high school basketball is all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Paez replaces Gary Cain, who coached the Pilots for four seasons and will focus 
on his duties as a counselor. Banning is a member of the City 4-A Division and 
competes in the Southern Pacific Conference against teams such as Dorsey and 
Crenshaw. The Pilots finished 11-13 overall in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Paez said he had turned down several offers -- including coaching posts with 
professional teams in Ireland and Turkey -- before Banning Principal Augie 
Herrera called last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Ireland wasn't exactly a hotbed for European basketball," he said. "And 
besides, the money was marginal." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was seriously considering accepting the position in Turkey until 
Iraq invaded Kuwait. Turkey borders Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Banning contacted him at the recommendation of City Section Commissioner Hal 
Harkness, whom Herrera had contacted to discuss prospective coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I know about him and from the endorsements from (Cleveland Principal 
Ida Mae Windham), I thought that if somebody of his caliber and character was 
available, we should try to keep him around," Harkness said. 
</P>
<P>
Paez said he welcomes the job of building a program that has struggled. 
Banning, a perennial City power in football, traditionally has fielded .500 
teams in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a completely different set of challenges," he said. "The goal at 
Cleveland was to maintain that tradition and take it a step further. But just 
because we don't have the same kind of talent here that we had at Cleveland 
doesn't mean I won't put in the same kind of effort."

Fillmore High played without its starting running backs during a 26-0 
season-opening victory over Pater Noster on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Tory Cabral, an All-Southern Section tailback, and Anthony Chessani, a senior 
fullback, were suspended from last week's game because of a violation of school 
rules, according to Coach Curtis Garner. 
</P>
<P>
In their stead, Jon Alvarado and Val Pillado combined for 165 yards and three 
touchdowns. However, Garner said that he expected Cabral and Chessani to start 
Friday against Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Cabral rushed for 1,555 yards and 15 touchdowns in leading Fillmore to 
the Division IX quarterfinals. Chessani, a starter as a sophomore, did not play 
last season. BRIAN MURPHY

FOSTER GETS START AT INSIDE LINEBACKER

The Aztecs will likely have a new look at inside linebacker Saturday against 
Cal State Long Beach when transfer Lou Foster makes his first start. Foster, a 
junior from DeAnza Community College (near San Jose), won the job in spring 
practice but pulled a hamstring in mid-August and didn't resume practicing 
until last week. Freshman Jamal Duff, who started at inside linebacker Saturday 
at Oregon, has a left quadricep contusion and a right-hand chip fracture and 
didn't practice Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure looks like (Foster will start)," defensive coordinator Barry Lamb 
said. "Jamal was unable to go (Tuesday), and we don't know about (Wednesday). 
Really, the same thing happened to Lou before the Oregon game. He would have 
started had he been healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Brian Barry said Duff is day-to-day, and probable for Saturday's game. 
But if Duff doesn't practice today, he will have missed the two heavy workdays 
in the Aztecs' game preparation. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, meanwhile, said he is ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to be back," he said. "It's been too long. I've got a lot of energy 
to take out on somebody. Long Beach is just the team to do it (against)." 
</P>
<P>
Just when you thought Cal State Long Beach Coach George Allen, 72, had seen 
everything, here is a new one: SDSU wide receiver Jimmy Raye III is the son of 
Jimmy Raye II, who played for Allen when Allen coached the Los Angeles Rams. 
"It's interesting to be playing against one of my former player's sons," Allen 
said. "I think that's the first time that's ever happened." Raye's reaction? 
"I've never met him," Raye said. "I've never even thought about my dad playing 
for George Allen before." . . . Allen on SDSU's promotion whereby fans get free 
pizza if the two teams' combined score Saturday is his age or higher: "They 
didn't have my permission to do that," he said, laughing. "I hope our defense 
is better than that." . . . Free safety Johnny Walker (groin) and defensive 
lineman Pio Sagapolutele (bruised knee) missed practice Tuesday. Neither injury 
is considered serious. . . . Injury report: Defensive lineman Steve Matuszewicz 
(ankle) is doubtful for Saturday's game, and defensive back Zac Stokes 
(shoulder) is out. SCOTT MILLER

Wende Brown, last season's Southern Section 4-A Division Player of the Year, 
had eight kills and three blocks Tuesday night to lead Royal High to a 15-7, 
15-5, 15-0 win over host Louisville in the girls' volleyball opener for both 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Brown got help from Becky Campbell, who added six kills, and Jennifer Hamilton, 
who had five kills and six blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good match against (Louisville) because we played well together," 
Brown said. "We were comfortable with each other's hitting. We are coming 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Louisville player Torie Sumner agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked like they had been playing together for a long time," Sumner said. 
"Our team was a lot smaller than they were and their blocking was a big 
strength in their defense." ADAM BENSON

STATWATCH: ROYAL FINDS CREED WELL-RECEIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With 164 yards and two touchdowns, Royal High's Jeff Creed got a lot of mileage 
out of his three receptions Friday night. He averaged 54.7 yards a catch and 
scored on plays of 77 and 71 yards in a 31-3 win over Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, however, Creed did not even have the best numbers for a 
player named Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Jeff Gibbons, and very swiftly at that. The Oak Park receiver amassed 166 
yards and three touchdowns on three catches for an average of 55.3 yards a 
grab. Gibbons scored on receptions of 71, 70 and 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
There were two other scoring catches of at least 70 yards -- by Palmdale's 
Brian Porter (79 yards) and Saugus' David Doyle (70). 
</P>
<P>
Passing: On the other end of Porter's and Doyle's catches were passers making 
their only throws of the night. Running back Anthony Ortega hit Porter on an 
option play in the first quarter of Palmdale's 38-13 loss to Muir, and reserve 
quarterback Rich Gutierrez connected with Doyle in the second half of Saugus' 
28-0 blowout of South Pasadena. . . . Saugus starter Jeff Hickman connected on 
10 of 13 passes for 157 yards. . . . The only numbers better than Hickman's 
were those of Royal junior Ryan Fien: 13 of 15 for 231 yards, a 17.8-yard 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Rushing: Wide receiver Pat Escamilla of St. Francis made the most of two 
carries on reverse plays, dashing for touchdowns of 26 and 61 yards. . . . 
Three running backs chalked up more than 190 yards -- Channel Islands' Renard 
Carn (197), Glendale's Pathon Rucker (191) and Quartz Hill's Erik Thomas (191). 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill gained 390 yards on the ground in its 39-12 win over South 
Bakersfield; the Rebels allowed just 19 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Defense: Chaminade (1-0-1) has 12 sacks -- six in each of its first two games. 
Lineman Brent Martin leads the Eagles with five sacks. The strong pressure has 
resulted in good pass defense. Opposing passers have completed just 14 of 33 
tries for 185 yards, and safety Travis Hall has two interceptions.

RELATIONSHIPS: THOUGH THINLY WRITTEN, CARRIE FISHER'S SCRIPT FOR 'POSTCARDS

<P>
"Postcards From the Edge"!? We should be so lucky. You can write something on a 
postcard. This is more like fortune cookies; pithy, expert zingers from the 
mother-daughter battlefield, Hollywood division: a star of '50s musicals 
(Shirley MacLaine) and her movie actress-daughter (Meryl Streep) struggling 
back from a drug habit that lifelong insecurity has built. 
</P>
<P>
As Carrie Fisher has adapted her successful, somewhat autobiographical 1987 
novel about the physical and psychological rehabilitation of a spirited, 
wisecracking, just-turning-30 actress, she has taken one of the book's more 
minor preoccupations, the mother-daughter stuff, and made it the movie's whole 
shooting match. 
</P>
<P>
"Postcards" (opening citywide) is a puzzlement. It's possible to float out of 
it on the immense high generated by Meryl Streep's two final numbers -- singing 
as affectingly as Bonnie Raitt. If it needed proving, it's clear now that there 
is nothing Streep cannot do, except, possibly, oral surgery and high-platform 
diving, and only a sucker would bet against either of those. 
</P>
<P>
As director Mike Nichols speeds the movie by and Streep's Suzanne Vale gives 
behind-the-scenes Hollywood the benefit of her wry eye and bad mouth, it's a 
funny world to be let in on -- hip, inside and deadly clever. Unsurprisingly, 
with this director and this writer, "Postcards" cuts close to the bone with its 
insights about the workings of old and new Hollywood -- a past full of stars 
with ironclad images built by studios and nourished by fan mags, and an 
unsentimental and utterly forgetful present in which grosses alone are the 
measure of success. 
</P>
<P>
But apart from Suzanne and her egocentric mama, MacLaine's Doris Mann, who can 
suck all the oxygen from a room with one dazzling, artificial smile, 
"Postcards" is amazingly thin. Its subsidiary characters, The Director (Gene 
Hackman), The Producer (Dennis Quaid) and The Emergency Room Doctor (Richard 
Dreyfuss) have the depth of shrink-wrap. 
</P>
<P>
Defiantly underwritten, onscreen for mere minutes, these anemics get what clout 
they have from the sheer warmth and presence of their actors, a considerable 
amount in the case of Hackman and Dreyfuss. Quaid, playing a character so 
loosely sketched that it isn't clear whether he's a producer or Suzanne's 
fellow actor, still seems to be flailing away like Jerry Lee Lewis, although 
that song has ended. 
</P>
<P>
As we first meet Suzanne, she's tailspinning, bluffing and snorting her way 
through a crummy-looking movie about Latin American intrigue, directed by 
Hackman. Next, she overdoses in the other half of Quaid's bed and finds herself 
in a detox center, headed by a no-nonsense therapist played by C.C.H. Pounder 
-- her power reduced to slivers of scenes. Improbably brief as the detox 
section is, Streep gets memorable support from Robin Bartlett as her rehab 
roomie Aretha ("I think my parents were expecting someone black"), whose dry 
delivery and owlish take on life are the stuff on which lifelong friendships 
are made. 
</P>
<P>
Doris, a whirlwind of compulsive bossiness, arrives at detox, too, so 
conspicuously self-effacing she's brought Woolite to rinse out a few of her 
daughter's things. It's also clear that though she's judgmental about drugs, 
she's a hard-working alcoholic herself, heightening the irony that, to work 
again, Suzanne must live with her "responsible" mother. Screenwriter Fisher 
further nails Doris when an ecstatic patient-fan burbles that he's wanted to be 
her since he was 7. Doris hits the radiance button, then, under her breath to 
Suzanne as they leave, says, "Sorry, but you know how much the queens love me." 
</P>
<P>
With clear-eyed venom like this, or when they're characterizing slimeballs like 
Rob Reiner's unctuous producer, Fisher and Nichols are unmatchable. Best of all 
is the blistering irony behind MacLaine's musical high point, her own "Rose's 
Turn," when Doris allows herself to be pulled center stage to perform at the 
coming-home party she's thrown for Suzanne. 
</P>
<P>
The number exposes every iota of support and competitiveness between mother and 
daughter: the bitterness of Doris' refrain in Sondheim's "I'm Still Here," and 
the ultimate professionalism of her delivery; the love and pride on Suzanne's 
face watching her -- and her twinge as her mother exploits her daughter's drug 
problems in public. If Doris complains that Suzanne won't use her singing 
talent, there's no doubt why after mama's triumphantly brassy piano-top finale. 
</P>
<P>
These and wickedly funny backstage snapshots of moviemaking are the good times 
of "Postcards," but even they can't hide its emotional starvation. While we 
chortle at the one-liners -- and Streep's running, grumbling delivery of them 
-- the real work seems to happen too fast and offscreen. Drug rehabilitation, 
family reconciliation, career regeneration. Peculiarly matched though Streep 
and MacLaine seem as a mother and daughter, they wring every drop of empathy 
from a last-minute hospital-bed scene of caring and contrition. Nevertheless, 
"Postcards" is a quick-sketch of a screenplay whose details are still to come. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it comes straight out of left field, Streep's performance as a country 
singer at the movie's close is irresistible. Just let your mind alone at this 
point; this is such unabashed fun that there's not much left to do but roll 
with it, in the same way you can luxuriate in Michael Ballhaus' fluid camera 
work, Patrizia Von Brandenstein's designs for the peculiarly awful movies 
Suzanne is making, Ann Roth's wittily perfect costumes and J. Roy Helland's 
superb hair and makeup, which in MacLaine's case is a devastating trip down 
Memory Lane.

CHICANO SHOW MIXES ADVOCACY, AESTHETICS

<TEXT>
<P>
In an epoch when polarization runs high and skins rub thin, the multi-ethnic 
Los Angeles Festival wants to nurture understanding between the diverse 
cultures on the Pacific Rim. Lurking behind this benign and healing impulse is 
the danger that the festival might fail to draw the right balance between 
ethnography and art. Too much of the one and the festival speaks only to the 
already initiated. Too little of the other and it disappoints an audience 
expecting entertainment or aesthetic delectation. 
</P>
<P>
The problem nags at the most prominent art exhibition associated with the 
festival. Titled "CARA" (an acronym for "Chicano Art: Resistance and 
Affirmation"), it opened Sunday at UCLA's Wight Art Gallery and runs to Dec. 9. 
As a measure of its ambition, it will travel to seven museums around the 
country and includes about 130 works by more than 90 artists, including many 
collaborative projects and suggesting the communal urge that inspired the 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, it is an exercise in cultural history, out to educate -- even 
indoctrinate -- its audience, first in the history and mores of a U.S. 
subculture. But, unlike the recent "The Latin American Spirit: Art and Artists 
in the United States," "CARA" tightens the focus first to Americans of Mexican 
descent, then to that faction among them who wish to be known as Chicanos and 
as part of the Chicano movement. An interpretive glossary to be included in the 
show's yet-undelivered catalogue, defines the movement as social, cultural, 
political and out to assert and regain the civil rights in a community where 
some feel they have been lost. It defines Chicano as a "self-designating term 
for politicized people of Mexican descent in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, some Mexican-Americans regard the term as a slur. According to the 
glossary virtually all terms for Latin-descended U.S. citizens from Spanish to 
Latino to Hispanic are offensive to somebody, proving there is no consensus on 
the subject. U.S. citizens who call themselves "Americans" are generally 
regarded as arrogant as the whole continent is America, north and south. 
Chicanos embrace their handle as a symbol of identification with the poor and 
disenfranchised. 
</P>
<P>
The main essay by Shifra Goldman and Tomas Ybarra-Frausto says the movement is 
centered in the Southwest. The geography is known to Chicanos as Aztlan and 
regarded as the ancestral home of the Aztecs. During the heyday of the 
movement, some Chicanos held it was plunder lost to the Anglos in the 
Mexican-American War and they wanted it back. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition traces the movement from 1965 to 1985. The essay reviews it from 
Cesar Chavez's organization of the United Farm Workers in the '60s to its 
tragic apogee in East Los Angeles during a huge 1970 anti-Vietnam War 
demonstration when newsman Ruben Salazar was killed by a tear-gas canister 
fired by a sheriff's deputy. It moves on to such cultural matters as the 
representation of Latinos in feature films like Gregory and Anna Nava's classic 
"El Norte." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of this is informative if sometimes myopically biased but it does create 
a problem that is shared by the increasingly large numbers of exhibitions that 
want to link fine art to social and political issues. There is always a 
traumatic disjuncture between the intellectual and generalizing mind-set of the 
social historian and the intensely personal and specific operation of the 
artist. Even when the artist consciously shares the intellectual's goals, his 
creative product and its scholarly rationale repel each another like magnets 
turned the wrong way. They represent irreconcilable modes of human expression. 
Art is about organic feeling which is reduced to cold ideology by advocacy 
scholarship. The Chicano art movement is not well-known to the general culture. 
In L.A. we have seen such occasional museum exhibitions as the County Museum of 
Art's "Los Four" in 1974 and commercial gallery shows that have created 
individual reputations for such artists as the late Carlos Almaraz, Gronk and 
John Valadez, among others. "CARA" creates the impression that Chicano art was 
less an organized movement than a spontaneous expression. 
</P>
<P>
Spontaneity is hard to define but very convincing, as when somebody suddenly 
slugs you. That is what the real art in "CARA" does and it's a big relief after 
all the polemic. The art also bursts unexpectedly into song or plants a big 
kiss on your kisser. You feel like you've been invited into the barrio to share 
the artists' most tender and angry feelings. 
</P>
<P>
The trademark form of Chicano art is its powerful, raw murals, like the noted 
works of L.A.'s Judith Baca. They speak most clearly of a subculture struggling 
for internal cohesion and individual identity. Since murals can't be brought 
into an art gallery, they are represented, diluted, in a slide show. Other 
installations remained unfinished as vernissage festivities approached on 
Sunday, but the spirit was there. 
</P>
<P>
The very first image encountered in the galleries is a woodcut by Carlos Cortez 
Koyokuikatl, a portrait including the phrase, "Art for art's sake is an 
absurdity." About three-quarters of the work echoes that sentiment. It's out to 
be forceful, idealistic, heartfelt and funny rather than perfect. You want 
generosity? Look at Amalia Mesa-Bains' "An Ofrenda for Dolores del Rio." There 
are works echoing the artists' admiration for Mexican Surrealist Frida Kahlo 
but only one of them -- by Yreina D. Cervantes -- approaches the quality of 
Kahlo's art. Admiring memories of the great Mexican revolutionary muralists, 
Rivera, Siqueiros and Orozco, are everywhere with a dollop of Posada and a 
whiff of Tamayo thrown in. Yet none of the Chicano artists display the masters' 
command of materials, heroic scale or symbolic savvy. 
</P>
<P>
The style of what we see here is that of neighborhood art. Even markedly 
professional artists like Luis Jimenez retain an aura of home-grown funk. 
Rather than taking that immediately as a shortcoming, let's look at it as a 
diagnostic symptom. It's really not unlike what we've seen coming out from the 
now-liberated Soviet underground. It's art made to express intimate feelings to 
be shared with friends and family without consideration of a larger audience. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a shame to change the candor of Carmen Lomas Garza. Her gentle 
poetry is already complete in "Camas Para Suenos" where we see mother making 
the beds while the kids lounge on the roof dreaming at the moon. Gilbert 
Lujan's Pachuco dogs and Aztec-jaguar lowriders have already been ripped off as 
boutique knickknacks, proving he can't afford to get much slicker. 
</P>
<P>
"CARA" shows a complete sensibility. It's socially concerned, inbred, romantic, 
proud, nostalgic, ceremonial, masochistic, fetishistic and original. Where 
would the Anglos have been for fashion after World War II without the zoot 
suit? 
</P>
<P>
Any art judged by sensibility is of interest just as all people are of 
interest. "CARA's" collective look becomes a simile of a stay-with-the-gang 
subculture. That works among the home folks but in a larger world, it's 
different -- as proven by the growth of numerous artists here. Now they are in 
the Wight Gallery, which once housed a retrospective of Henri Matisse. That 
raises the ante just as society does when Junior moves out and has to please an 
objective boss, not just his mom and buddies. 
</P>
<P>
The most successful single body of work here are the photographs. Maybe that's 
because a demand for technical savvy is built into the medium. Ricardo 
Valverde's "Boulevard Night" doesn't lose an ounce of eloquence from being well 
composed and printed. Technique enhances the dark glamour of a barrio street 
cruise and a girl with Egyptian eyes. Photos are also ideally suited to 
exhibitions with a sociological bias, as witness the work of Harry Gamboa Jr., 
Adam Avila and others. 
</P>
<P>
Graphic art looks strong because it's learnable and a natural medium for 
propaganda. Rupert Garcia's red barbed-wire image " Cesen Deportacion!" is as 
good as any prime Cuban revolutionary poster, but his striking image of Zapata 
falls apart. It's a drawing problem around the jaw line and that's odd because 
a lot of the more cartoony work shows immense natural facility. 
</P>
<P>
To paraphrase the moribund comedian, "Dying is easy, painting is hard." More 
paintings are blown among "CARA" works than in any other medium. Daniel 
Galvez's dogged, hyperreal "Homegirl" is a triumph of expression over art. The 
tough lady stands there in her T-shirt and the image is so present it nails us 
to the wall. But no thanks to Galvez's worriful paint handling. Baca has 
similar problems in "The Three Marias." When you have to agonize too much it 
hurts the work. 
</P>
<P>
"CARA's" art rarely shows Chicano artists at their best. The exhibition proves 
that combining art and sociology is still a dicey business requiring more skill 
than was shown here. More importantly, "CARA" proves that the issue of quality 
in art will not go away. Some commentators are insisting these days that 
quality is a code word for the judgmental domination of white males. Nonsense. 
That's not what the word means. Quality has to do with every person's desire to 
get better, to express themselves with greater eloquence, force and finesse. 
The best artist in "CARA" wants to do that. So do I. So do you.

<P>
Now here's a fellow you would love to have at your next party. He's a laugh a 
minute, has a way with the ladies and is one natty dresser. Now, if he would 
only quit drooling over the guests. 
</P>
<P>
In its current production of "Little Red Riding Hood," the American Children's 
Theatre of Anaheim gives us one of the most likable Big Bad Wolves ever to step 
out of a fairy tale. The William Kilborne/Albert Viola adaptation continues at 
the Anaheim Cultural Arts Center through Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Halkyard directs the show and appears as the wolf. Working with an already 
campy script, Halkyard plays this "Red" for laughs from the first scene. It's 
part melodrama, part vaudeville shtick, and, for the most part, it works. 
</P>
<P>
Halkyard's wolf is a ravenous, fast-talking con man with a weakness for 
two-legged treats. Or, as he explains in his opening song, "For little 
children, I'm the perfect host / I like little children . . . on whole wheat 
toast." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, that's about as gruesome as it gets. Compared to the original tale 
-- in which the villainous fur ball gobbles up granny, Red and just about 
anything else in his path -- this wolf is a relative pussycat. He spends more 
time cozying up to audience members and moaning about his lousy press than he 
does pursuing his next meal. 
</P>
<P>
Halkyard is easily the most polished of the five-member cast. At a performance 
Saturday, he ignored the auditorium's uncomfortably high temperatures and 
delivered a consistently high-energy performance. He made liberal use of the 
show's in-the-round setting, eliciting giggles, comments -- and, in the case of 
one startled 3-year-old, tears -- during his forays into the audience. As the 
grandmother, 16-year-old Susanna Johnson matches Halkyard's enthusiasm. Decked 
out in hi-top tennies and an extravagantly padded bosom, Johnson's granny is a 
gravel-voiced, no-baloney kind of gal. Her Keystone Cops-style scene with 
Halkyard at the end of the play is one of the show's high points. 
</P>
<P>
Next to these two, 13-year-old April Litvinov and adults Cassandra Beckerman 
and Bob Johnson have a hard time keeping up. As Little Red, the petite Litvinov 
doesn't seem plucky enough to shortcut through the forest and risk a 
confrontation with the wolf, but her singing voice is sure and strong, and 
lends itself well to a sweet duet with her mother at the opening of the show. 
As mother and the love-sick woodsman, Beckerman and Johnson (Susanna's 
real-life dad) reach for, but don't quite attain, the larger-than-life 
characterizations of melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Holden's costumes are simple but effective, especially the wolf's sporty 
pegged pants and fluorescent necktie worn over head-to-toe fake fur. Halkyard's 
sets and lighting were equally serviceable. Bill Graber's piano accompaniment 
adds welcome punch to the musical numbers. 
</P>
<P>
One last tip: If you're planning to see "Little Red Riding Hood" on a hot day, 
dress in cool clothing and bring a fan. The auditorium is not air-conditioned 
and can become very warm. 
</P>
<P>
"Little Red Riding Hood" begins the 1990-91 season of the American Children's 
Theatre of Anaheim. Founded in 1987 by Herman Boodman and the late Philo Hatch, 
the nonprofit troupe has presented more than 300 performances of classic 
children's plays to date. Each show in the five-play season runs 10 weekends in 
order to reach as many young theatergoers as possible, said Boodman, who serves 
as the troupe's managing director. Halkyard, who heads his own North County 
youth groups -- Center Stage Productions and Broadway on Tour -- was recently 
named the troupe's resident director, and will stage three of this year's 
shows. This season continues through next August with "Goldilocks and the 
Christmas Bears," "Brementown Musicians" and Halkyard's musical adaptation of 
"Alice in Wonderland," and "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."

Hip Hop: The ever-prolific director Reza Abdoh is replacing himself on Los 
Angeles Theatre Center's upcoming fall/winter roster of plays. 
</P>
<P>
Abdoh's new "The Hip-Hop Waltz of Eurydice," which blends the Orpheus/Eurydice 
myth with science fiction and Japanese ritual, will open Dec. 13, with previews 
beginning Nov. 28. That had been the time slot planned for his "Bogeyman," 
co-written with Mira-Lanicq Oglesby. But the play has been postponed until the 
1991-92 fall/winter season. BETH KLEID

Walters Mum on Separation: Television interviewer Barbara Walters, rarely at a 
loss for words, has taken a non-speaking role in the trial separation from her 
husband, Los Angeles businessman Mervyn Adelson, former chair of Lorimar 
Telepictures. 
</P>
<P>
Maurie Perl, a spokesman for Walters at ABC-TV, announced the separation and 
said Walters would have no comment to make on it. "They've been married since 
May, 1986, and have decided to separate on a trial basis," Perl said. "They 
have no plans beyond that." BETH KLEID

<P>
 Airs Thursday on KCET-TV Channel 28 at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There are images in Kenji Mizoguchi's 1953 "Ugetsu," one of the most famous 
and celebrated of all Japanese films, that linger in the memory for a lifetime 
-- most notably, that of a man and a woman enjoying a picnic in a meadow. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, however, is a beautiful, aristocratic ghost (Machiko Kyo) while the 
man is but a humble potter (Masayuki Mori), whose loyal wife is played by 
Kinuyo Tanaka. Interwoven in this struggle is Mizoguchi's characteristic 
concern for the battle between creativity and destruction. As usual in a 
Mizoguchi film, women are the true central figures, and Mizoguchi is as 
masterful a director of actresses as was George Cukor.KEVIN THOMAS

'MOVIETELLER' RENEWS AN ART; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: FROM ABOUT 1910 TO THE '30S, KOREAN MOVIETELLERS TRANSLATED FILMS FOR 
AUDIENCES. WALTER LEW USES THE TECHNIQUE AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLARA EUM, Eum is a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walter Lew's parents are doctors and when Lew decided not to apply to medical 
school after his pre-med years at Hampshire College, his Korean parents nearly 
had heart attacks. What then, they asked, did he want to do? 
</P>
<P>
"Become a poet, a filmmaker, a storyteller or simply all of the above," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the day he decided to change his major from pre-med to creative writing 
at Brown University, the Baltimore-born Lew has come a long way. His poems have 
won him the New York State Council on the Arts' Poetry Fellowship in 1982, and 
his work has also appeared in the latest Norton's anthology, New World of 
Literature. Most recently he was named to receive a $20,000 interarts grant 
from the NEA for a new work. 
</P>
<P>
Between free-lancing for CBS Television as a producer and working as production 
manager for independent filmmakers, Lew has managed to create an innovative 
film piece, "Movieteller: Kogi-Eso," ("Over There"), which opens Thursday at 
the Inner City Cultural Center as part of the Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Lew's film, "The Movieteller," revives the forgotten tradition of the pyonsa, 
or movieteller, using collages of American pop music and excerpts from old 
American movies. 
</P>
<P>
Pyonsas are Korean storytellers who were popular in about the 1910s in Korea, 
who provided translation of foreign films. Sitting off to the side of the 
stage, they would translate and play all the actors' parts in the movie. 
Pyonsas became so popular, they were treated as celebrities and sometimes 
influenced the contents of the movies until the profession died out in the 
'30s, when sound replaced them. 
</P>
<P>
In Lew's film -- which he helped construct and edit with this production in 
mind -- a lonely old pyonsa, feeling useless and empty, comes to settle in the 
United States. But, one afternoon, he encounters a mermaid, (footage reshot 
from "Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid" and "Submariner") who, in gratitude for his 
hospitality, leads him down to a cinematic undersea realm. There, he is granted 
a chance to recapture his previous glory when the mermaid asks him to salvage 
and narrate an old feature film based on Korea's favorite classical romance, 
"Ch'unhyang Chon." 
</P>
<P>
"Ch'unhyang Chon" takes place in 18th-Century Seoul and concerns the courtship 
between the beautiful daughter of a former geisha and a nobleman who goes off 
to take the equivalent of a civil service exam -- which in Korea has a very 
powerful and prestigious status. In his absence, Ch'unhyang remains faithful to 
her betrothed despite a cruel mayor's torment. 
</P>
<P>
While presenting his movie, Lew sits between the audience and projection 
screen, giving live, simultaneous narration and storytelling his own movie, as 
a pyonsa. 
</P>
<P>
Lew, 34, and his main collaborator, Lewis Klahr, a noted New York-based collage 
filmmaker and animator, use Korean dancers and musicians, recorded classical 
and pop music, poetry readings, subtitles and cartoons to make this film an 
unusual experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought the Ch'unhyang story was visually boring," Lew said. "Another 
traditional story with undersea imagery allows us to use elements we thought 
were interesting. The cartoon, for example." 
</P>
<P>
To do this movie, Lew met a real pyonsa, who is a taxi driver living in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me the pyonsas were so powerful in their days, police informers 
frequently caused shows to be halted and the pyonsas arrested for their 
anti-colonist polemics," Lew said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike past pyonsas, Lew uses live and taped music with a script, much of it in 
verse, and introduces his audience to a variety of conflicting and enhancing 
imagery. 
</P>
<P>
For Lew, the project was an ideal opportunity to explore and experiment with 
new expressions for his poetry and Korean tradition. "I felt if you put a poet 
between the film and the audience, the poet regains his control of imagery," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While there are few Asian-Amerian filmmakers and even fewer Korean-Americans in 
the industry, Lew said he would like to be referred to as a filmmaker and not 
focus attention to the fact that he is a Korean-American filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to be recognized for my aesthetic abilities, rather than as being 
a Korean-American," Lew said. 
</P>
<P>
His films have received positive reviews, at premieres in New York, Minneapolis 
and Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time a movie like this will be shown in Los Angeles," Lew 
said. "It is a film for people who are ready for something different, something 
old and new. It's a film not only for Koreans, but also for everyone with an 
imagination."

WOMEN'S VIEWS AT SANTA MONICA PLAYHOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
A falling star and a fallen woman make up this late show at Santa Monica 
Playhouse. Under Julian Neil's understanding direction, both women have their 
charms -- in their disparate fashions. 
</P>
<P>
First is Barbara Eaton's "Smoke &amp; Mirrors," an incisive look at '30s 
superstar Jean Harlow. The script is crammed with detail, and looks as though 
it might be part of a larger work, but it does stand on its own. Harlow is just 
beginning to suffer from the kidney problems that led to her early death, and 
looks back on her wedding night and the drama that caused the injury. 
</P>
<P>
The emotional maelstrom that followed Harlow to the top and the insecurity that 
kept her spinning there is affectingly limned by Paula Randol-Smith, with 
empathy and affection for Harlow's memory. 
</P>
<P>
Next is a quiet charmer, Corinne Calvet in a "performed reading" of Diana 
Miller's adaptation of Michael Drury's "Advice to a Young Wife from an Old 
Mistress." It's advice made more sage by Calvet's subtle wit and the fact that 
she is French. An American wife might have ignored the whole thing. As Angela, 
reading the missive many years after Matthew -- the husband in question -- is 
gone, Calvet savors the piece like a sip of Calvados.

CHARACTERS HALF-BAKED IN GORDON'S 'NEW YORK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheila Gordon has an interesting gimmick tying together her one-woman gallery 
of characters in "New York: Sex, Killing and the Shopping" in a tiny space 
called Ravello's. It seems that the arrival in New York of a Russian-Jewish 
"madcap" talk-show hostess, who explores "sexual perestroika," touches the 
lives of seven New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
But the hostess is the least interesting of Gordon's group. Oddly enough, the 
two men in her collection of oddballs hit closest to the truth, both as satire 
and as honest theater. The first is disjointed junkie Rich who, on the lookout 
for drugs in the East Village, commits murder. The second is a hilarious street 
hustler who flogs his "foolproof lucky number" system onto passersby in the 
manner of television's become-a-millionaire gurus. They're clever inventions. 
</P>
<P>
Under Jonathan Schmock's direction, Gordon is a talented and winning character 
actress who knows the angles and curves of her subjects, but her writing rarely 
rises above surface conventions. Most of her characters are stereotypes who 
look like outtakes from "Saturday Night Live" and make this hour a long sit. 
</P>

 At 730 Arizona Ave., Santa Monica, Thursday through Sunday, 10 p.m.; ends 
Sept. 16. $10; (213) 393-1588. T.H. McCULLOH

'MONEYMAN': MUSIC RICH, CHARACTERIZATION POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Spawned in the aftermath of the Watts Riots, PASLA (The Performing Arts Society 
of Los Angeles) played a historic role in black L.A. theater until the company 
lost its focus some years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Its first show in a year, "Moneyman," in the Dorsey High auditorium, is an 
ambitious Mardi Gras musical with flashes of talent between interminable dead 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
The strength is music director Al Von Johnson's live band, with original French 
Quarter rhythms, rap and infectious blues (richly vocalized by Lloyd Robinson's 
flavorful minstrel man.) 
</P>
<P>
The uncredited costuming is hot. But unevenness prevails. The one performer who 
lights up the stage every time she moves (dancer Tara Speights) is regrettably 
underused. She's the promise of what PASLA could be. 
</P>
<P>
If Ron Daniels tightens up his book and director Vantile E. Whitfield snaps up 
the pacing, a good place to start would be with Cassandra Brown's scheming 
ex-hooker and Fitz Houston's entitled moneyman-pimp. These featured characters 
in the 20-member cast grow tiresome and repetitious. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, where's the black community? The opening night attendance was shameful 
(40 people, in an auditorium yet!). Does anybody care about promotion? 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey High School, at the corner of Rodeo and Farmdale; ends Friday and 
Saturday, 8 p.m. $5-$8. (213-734-2498. RAY LOYND

When you enter the theater to see Ben DeBaldo's musical, "Borderlines," you 
still haven't entered the theater. Inside Fairfax High School's big Main Stage, 
auditorium seats are empty. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the crowd is on the stage itself, facing further upstage to a curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Out come "The Wayfarers," an early '60s, three-woman group putting on a 
retrospective gig. They're supposed to be playing the Pantages, but 
"Borderlines" feels a lot closer to Fairfax High. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona DuBarry, Tania Gonzalez and Tanya Smith sing with heartfelt conviction, 
but it's too much of a stretch to believe they're at, for example, the 
Supremes' level. Director DeBaldo keeps a light tone and humor (aided by Andrew 
Darrah Devore's double roles as talent agent and priest), at the cost of 
throwing light on the dark side of show biz. 
</P>
<P>
Because the girls are out of East L.A., their rise to the top is a tad too 
easy. They also wouldn't have risen just on the basis of singing covers like 
"Let the Good Times Roll" and "Sincerely." There isn't an original tune in the 
show.

GAO WARNS OF BANK FAILURES, FEDERAL BAILOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The General Accounting Office warned Tuesday that the nation's banking system 
is in such fragile condition that a recession could bring on the failure of 
several major banks, wiping out the federal deposit insurance fund and making a 
taxpayer bailout necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In unusually pessimistic testimony, Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, the 
head of the agency, told the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs 
Committee that the banking industry is plagued by billions of dollars in losses 
not yet identified by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"Not since its birth during the Great Depression has the federal system of 
deposit insurance for commercial banks faced such a period of danger and 
uncertainty as it does today," Bowsher said. 
</P>
<P>
His warning was prompted by a new GAO study of 300 large and troubled banks 
that identified 35 institutions as in danger of failing within a year, with 
potential total losses ranging from $4.4 billion to $6.3 billion. Those figures 
would take a massive bite out of the insurance fund, which had dwindled to $13 
billion at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The bank insurance fund protects deposits of as much as $100,000 and has the 
ultimate support of Congress and the President, who have pledged that insured 
depositors will not lose a penny. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping that promise in the case of savings and loan deposits will cost the 
taxpayers between $90 billion and $130 billion, without including the future 
cost of interest on the bonds sold to shut insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay off their 
depositors. Federal officials now say that it may be necessary to keep some 
weak thrifts open under close government supervision to avoid adding to the 
rising cost of the financial rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
The banking industry generally is considered much healthier than the ravaged 
S&amp;Ls, but Bowsher's strongly worded testimony Tuesday warned of possibly 
dangerous problems ahead. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, the man who runs the deposit guarantee system as chairman 
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., has told Congress that the fund is 
under stress and could lose $2 billion or more this year. However, Bowsher was 
much gloomier Tuesday, describing a disaster waiting to happen and suggesting 
that Seidman's corps of bank examiners has not found the real extent of bank 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials must "dig deeper" in examining the banks, Bowsher said, 
calling for on-site examinations of problem institutions on an annual basis and 
for more frequent certified reports by accountants on banks' financial health. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers quickly moved to dispel any linkage between their industry and problems 
of the S&amp;L business. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't equate it to the situation in the savings and loan industry -- they 
are totally distinct," John W. Spiegel, chief financial officer of SunTrust 
Banks, based in Atlanta, said after an American Bankers Assn. press conference 
in New York on the industry's health. 
</P>
<P>
The number of banks on the government's problem list dropped to 1,000 last 
year, down from nearly 1,600 in 1987, according to Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest, most significant thing is that banking institutions are 
diversified in nature compared to thrifts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO study discovered 35 impaired banks, situated principally in the 
Northeast and Southwest, with a high risk of failure. Bowsher did not identify 
the banks but said that none are among the nation's 10 largest banks. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 of the 35 banks had failed as of Aug. 13; and, if all collapsed into 
insolvency, the losses could run as high as $6.3 billion, according to the GAO. 
"A significant number of other banks," also primarily in the Northeast and 
Southwest, "are at risk to fail within the next few years, particularly if 
their regional economies continue to deteriorate," Bowsher said. 
</P>
<P>
Failure of the sick 35 institutions and the other weak regional banks would 
"severely" injure the insurance fund, which has dropped by $5 billion in the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"A recession could exacerbate this problem, causing failure of other large 
banks beyond those we have identified, exhausting the fund and resulting in a 
taxpayer bailout," Bowsher warned. 
</P>
<P>
His testimony appeared to startle members of the Banking Committee, who 
seemingly had become inured to bad news about the ever-mounting cost of the 
thrift crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"You've given us a very serious warning," said the committee chairman, Sen. 
Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). "We have got to take steps to deal with the 
problem. There is a lot of phony accounting and failure to recognize true 
costs." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah), the committee's ranking Republican and a former 
chairman, said: "I don't want to be part of another fiasco." 
</P>
<P>
"The public is obviously concerned about Iraq . . . but there is not a more 
important issue than the strength of our financial structure and the economy," 
Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) said. 
</P>
<P>
On the House side, Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) said that he will offer 
legislation requiring banks to increase their contributions to the insurance 
fund by $23 billion. "Perhaps now we can get some action to beef up the bank 
insurance fund," said Annunzio, chairman of the financial institutions 
subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We must act immediately to make certain that the bank insurance fund does not 
require a taxpayer bailout," he said.

DAVIS SIGNS AGREEMENT TO KEEP RAIDERS IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raiders will stay in Los Angeles after all, provided the Coliseum undergoes 
a very substantial renovation and the stadium's private managers live up to the 
terms of a contract signed Tuesday whose full details will never be made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
But, at a value approaching $200 million, Los Angeles finally managed to outbid 
Oakland, Sacramento and Irwindale and give team owner Al Davis more than he 
could get in the other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Davis Tuesday said he had chosen Los Angeles over Oakland in a "tough" and 
"emotional" late night decision. Ed Snider, chief of Spectacor Limited 
Partnership, which will reconstruct and manage the Coliseum facility, said 
Davis will enter into a 20-year lease to stayas soon as the renovated Coliseum 
is ready. 
</P>
<P>
The latest agreement is not certain to last. It is contingent on a satisfactory 
environmental impact report on the renovation and on adequate financing, 
although the parties expressed confidence both would be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's developments marked the third time in the last three years that Davis 
has announced where his National Football League team will play in the future, 
each time in a different place. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, it was going to be Irwindale. Last spring, it was going to be Oakland. 
Both deals fell apart, and all Davis would say definitely on Tuesday was that 
this time he was "hoping" that this deal, privately financed unlike the others, 
would actually go through. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley voiced great enthusiasm about Davis' latest 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
"The jobs and economic activity that a professional football team generates is 
here to stay," said Bradley in a statement from London, where he was on a trade 
mission. "The Raiders will continue to call the historic Los Angeles Coliseum 
home. This is a reason for all football fans and admirers of the Coliseum to 
celebrate." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor had pursued the talks with the Raiders last spring when almost 
everyone else thought their move to Oakland was a foregone conclusion. Davis on 
Tuesday, at a news conference at the Coliseum, paid tribute to the mayor for 
his shrewdness in not giving up. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to make a choice," Davis said. "Los Angeles kept us here on its own 
merits. It was very competitive. . . . We are convinced there is a very loyal 
fan base here and we're going to try to do everything possible to make the 
Raiders a great football team in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he has been told by Snider, that all environmental impact reports, 
financing details, architectural drawings and other preliminaries may be 
complete by the end of the team's 1991 season and that the Raiders and USC -- 
another major Coliseum tenant -- will be playing in a new Coliseumrefurbished 
stadium by the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Davis said Tuesday, the Raiders may play in Dodger Stadium or Anaheim 
Stadium, or they may play all their games on the road. Other sources said 
Dodger Stadium appears to be the most likely possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, both Davis and Snider were vague about the details. Snider and 
his Spectacor colleague, Tony Tavares, said that the contract signed in private 
Tuesday morning contained an agreement between the two parties that neither 
would ever divulge its contents. 
</P>
<P>
They said final talks Monday night, which no one else knew about, had changed 
certain details from those disclosed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But two officials who had been close monitors of the talks and had done a great 
deal to expedite them in recent months, Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani and Coliseum 
Commissioner Bill Robertson, said they understand that these are the main 
points of the Raiders-Spectacor agreement: 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum, while its exterior walls and historic peristyle end will be 
maintained, will undergo a major interior reconstruction costing a projected 
$145 million. Between 150 and 225 luxury boxes will be constructed at 
mid-stadium levels, 15,000 club seats will be put in just below them, and the 
capacity of the Coliseum will be revised downward from the present 92,500 to 
about 70,000 for Raiders games and 85,000 for USC games. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, however, said he hopes the capacity for Raiders games will be 65,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Spectacor Limited Partnership, which in contrast to other Spectacor 
companies is Snider's own company, will make a total of $32 million in cash 
payments to the Raiders. The first $10 million was paid Tuesday, the second $10 
million is due in 21 months and the rest is payable in stages after that. 
</P>
<P>
The first $10 million is forfeitable if Spectacor cannot put together the 
project for any reason other than environmental obstacles. In the latter event, 
the Raiders would either take Spectacor along on their next stadium venture, or 
repay them $800,000 a year for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum Commission's $58-million breach-of-contract lawsuit against the 
Raiders was dismissed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, and $10 million 
that the Raiders allegedly owed the Coliseum from cash advances and rent 
credits awarded in the 1980s will be forgiven. Originally, Davis was supposed 
to use those funds to build luxury boxes. Now, he will keep it and the boxes 
will be built and leased out by Snider's company. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum reconstruction will be finished before anything is done on site 
toward building a new Sports Arena for the Los Angeles Clippers basketball 
franchise. If the Clippers do not want to wait, Bradley has written a letter 
saying his Administration will try to help find the Clippers other land for a 
new basketball arena in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
Another reliable source, who declined to be named, said that at the last moment 
the private management group making the agreement had to be altered, when the 
Pritzker family, a partner in the main Spectacor firm, said it was not 
interested in participating. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it is all Snider, for the moment," said this source. But he said that 
Snider has indicated he may take Irving Azoff in as a minority partner in the 
Coliseum venture. 
</P>
<P>
Snider himself said he was confident that financing would be obtained to allow 
the project to go forward, and Fabiani said that Bradley and other city 
officials are confident that the environmental impact report and historic 
preservation requirements will prove not to be obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani, Snider and Davis all said that they are ready to work closely with 
preservationists and the oriented Los Angeles Conservancy to make sure that the 
renovated Coliseum preserves the best features of the old while giving Los 
Angeles a facility that will serve the city well into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' decision to remain in the city, pending fulfillment of the promises made 
to him, came at a time when a $127-million offer made to him by Oakland had 
encountered difficulties. There were reports in Oakland that a reassessment of 
costs indicated that Oakland would have to spend perhaps $168 million, most of 
it in public money. Oakland on Aug. 31 had to extend its deadlines for making 
the offer final. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointment and consternation was expressed in Oakland Tuesday, after Davis 
had informed officials there of his decision to stick with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders owner said he realized that many Los Angeles fans had lost interest 
in the Raiders during the years of uncertainty over where they would play, but 
he vowed to work unceasingly now to give the city the best team he could, and 
he expressed confidence that the fans would come back.

COMPLAINTS OF SHODDY BUILDING PRACTICES PROMISE TO TURN THE INLAND EMPIRE'S 
HOUSING BOOM OF THE 1980S INTO A FERTILE AREA FOR HOMEOWNER LAWSUITS IN THE 
1990S.

SAN BERNARDINO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anthony J. Shubin was in the garage checking out his boat when he heard what 
sounded like gunshots. Next, he was on the ground, gasping for breath and in 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
Shubin was not hit by gunfire, but by his garage door, which slammed shut after 
the springs failed. So serious were his back injuries that he could not remain 
in his truck-driving job and now lives on disability pay. 
</P>
<P>
After the accident last year, Shubin sued the developer who built his San 
Bernardino home and the contractor who installed the garage door, thus joining 
a growing list of homeowners who are complaining about -- and suing -- 
developers of "affordable housing" in the burgeoning Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
Shubin, 37, lives in one of several troubled tract developments in this region 
east of Los Angeles that has emerged as a mecca of less-expensive housing for 
people who work in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Many young families have moved to San Bernardino and Riverside counties in 
search of a way into the Southern California home market. The inland counties, 
whose total population has swelled by 680,000 since 1985, were a long commute, 
but the bigger homes, bigger lots and lower prices seemed worth the hassle. 
</P>
<P>
But as affordable housing has gone up, so has the frustration and anger of 
buyers. They complain of shoddy building practices -- cracked foundations, 
lousy drainage, faulty plumbing, bowed doors. Experts cite builders who cut 
corners to cut costs, overworked building inspectors who do not have time to 
properly inspect, and a lack of skilled contractors in areas of strong demand 
for new homes. 
</P>
<P>
The problems are getting attention in Sacramento. The Legislature recently 
passed two bills to toughen disciplinary procedures for negligent contractors 
and set up the state's first certification standards for municipal housing 
inspectors. The bills have been sent to Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Although most builders are competent, the "bad ones . . . are giving the 
industry a black eye," said State Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino), the bills' 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Affordable housing doesn't have to be poorly built, but frequently it is, 
especially in fast-growing areas like the Inland Empire. "Poor quality and 
affordable housing often go hand in hand," said Joseph Donahue, a real estate 
attorney in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Inland Empire, some observers say, is turning into a case study. 
</P>
<P>
A housing boom has turned what was once a quiet desert outback into one of the 
fastest growing regions of the state. About 70,000 single-family houses have 
been built in San Bernardino County since 1985 as the population has surpassed 
1.4 million. The housing boom of the 1980s now promises to turn the Inland 
Empire into a fertile area for homeowner complaints and litigation in the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
In the Verdemont section of San Bernardino, homeowners were so disgruntled with 
their houses that they posted signs of protest in their front yards last year. 
Among the complaints were uneven floors, faulty plumbing and inadequate wiring. 
A spokesman for Monnig Development, which built the houses, said the firm had 
"responded in a reasonable manner to any reasonable complaints." He declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Colton Mayor Frank A. Gonzales last year sharply criticized the workmanship in 
a project known as Paradise Hills, built by DEHH Corp. Homeowners had 
complained to Gonzales about items from bowed doors to cracked floor tiles 
after they were unable to get the builder to fix the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales cited DEHH as the primary reason why the city of Colton recently 
passed an ordinance requiring all builders to put up a deposit of $350 per 
house to assure that new homes are built to the buyers' satisfaction. "Our 
experience with this company has been terrible," Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Stanger, president of DEHH, said that 39 houses in Paradise Hills had 
"cosmetic" problems, almost all of which have been fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Although complaining about new houses is hardly rare, the cost of litigation 
has typically prevented homeowners of modest means from suing, real estate 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
But litigation at times has proved effective. Thirty-four property owners in 
Riverside County recently joined forces and negotiated damage awards of nearly 
$100,000 per house from Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp., the state's largest 
single-family home builder. In a lawsuit that dragged on several years, the 
Riverside homeowners charged that their houses had construction defects, 
causing the upstairs floors to slant. Kaufman &amp; Broad settled the case this 
year by paying the homeowners about $3.3 million, not including attorneys' 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
The injured Shubin and 191 of his fellow homeowners have sued Forecast Corp., 
the San Bernardino County firm that built the housing tract several years ago. 
With that many single-family homeowners as plaintiffs, the legal action is 
believed to be the largest of its kind ever filed in California. 
</P>
<P>
The tract, known as Meadowood, has about 300 homes. The homes there sold in 
1986 and 1987 for well under $100,000, a bargain price by the standards of 
coastal California, where housing prices are the highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
However, aggrieved homeowners say the Meadowood houses are badly built 
throughout, with poor plumbing and defective garage doors, cracked foundations 
and bad drainage. The suit also alleges that sales agents failed to disclose 
that the neighborhood is located in a high-wind fire area and is adjacent to an 
earthquake fault. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a horror story," said Donald Kipp, a field representative for Sen. Ayala 
who visited Meadowood at the homeowners' request. "Those people bought those 
homes in good faith, and the homes are now crumbling." 
</P>
<P>
Forecast Corp. officials defend the Meadowood homes, adding that they will buy 
the houses back if the homeowners are able to show the dwellings have major 
construction defects. "We will make that a standing offer," said Jim Previti, 
Forecast's president. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have singled out the city of San Bernardino as having been particularly 
lax in overseeing its new-home construction boom. Until 1988, the city 
inspected new homes only superficially, according to James Mulvihill, professor 
of urban planning at Cal State San Bernardino. "They had drive-by inspections 
and sometimes not even that," Mulvihill said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry E. Reed, San Bernardino's current director of building and planning, 
agreed that the city's inspectors used to have trouble keeping pace with all 
the new houses going up, but inspections have improved recently as the city 
beefed up its supervisory force. 
</P>
<P>
According to Reed, Meadowood was inspected by an experienced employee who found 
nothing unusual. "The inspector did say there were some framing problems that 
had to be worked out," Reed said, "but other than that, it was a 
run-of-the-mill development." Reed declined to name the inspector. 
</P>
<P>
Forecast Corp. is a 19-year-old company that has built more than 6,000 homes in 
Southern California. A recent article in the Homebuyers Guide, a monthly 
magazine in Southern California, touts Forecast as a firm that offers 
"first-time buyers the highest standards of craftsmanship at reasonable 
prices." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Rankin, executive vice president for Forecast, predicted that the homeowner 
lawsuit will not survive close scrutiny. "This is not a valid lawsuit," Rankin 
said. "We intend to fight it all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Outside opinions vary about the quality of Forecast's construction. Tom Kohl, 
who heads the local chapter of the Building Industry Assn., called the 
company's work "very good." Others, however, have harsher assessments. "They've 
tried to improve," said Mulvihill, "but they have a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
The garage roof of a Forecast home recently blew off in Fontana, an incident 
that was well-publicized locally, but the firm declined to foot the $14,000 
repair cost. Company official Rankin said the roof had blown off in a 
110-m.p.h. wind, adding: "We can't protect against acts of God." 
</P>
<P>
The problems at Meadowood have been emotionally disturbing and financially 
draining for the property owners, typically young couples with young children. 
</P>
<P>
"When you own your own 'Money Pit,' it's not funny," said Geraldine Wong, a 
spokeswoman for the homeowners, referring to the movie about a young couple 
whose home falls apart. "It's a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
In one case, a major pipe break flooded Janice Lawrence's kitchen floor just 
before Christmas last year. "When you have to come up with $400 (for plumbing 
repairs) just before Christmas, it makes it kind of difficult," Lawrence said. 
"We don't have beaucoup bucks. We live from paycheck to paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
Private housing inspector William H. Irvin, who was hired by the homeowners, 
called the construction problems "many and varied. . . . The quality is just 
terrible." 
</P>
<P>
The houses in Meadowood were sold through sales agents of Great Western Real 
Estate -- an affiliate of Beverly Hills-based Great Western Bank. Great Western 
Real Estate and 10 of its sales agents were named as defendants in the lawsuit, 
filed in San Bernardino County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners say they were never told about the neighborhood's earthquake, 
wind and fire dangers. The homes are located 1 1/2 miles from the San Andreas 
Fault, Wong said, and some are on the site of a fire that destroyed 280 homes 
and killed four people in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Meadowood property owners are particularly upset about the fierce winter winds, 
which race through on their way up the El Cajon Pass. The winds are so strong 
that they have flattened walls and prevented residents from opening their car 
doors, homeowners say. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western officials declined comment, but Rankin defended the sales agents, 
saying such disclosures were not necessary and would have only hurt sales of 
the homes. He noted that earthquake faults are common, that the fire occurred 
several miles away and high winds are a fact of life in that part of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes common sense that if you're going to move somewhere, you should be 
familiar with the weather there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin conceded that the company had severe problems with garage-door springs 
-- including the ones that led to Shubin's injury 16 months ago. Scores of 
defective springs have had to be replaced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shubin has also filed a personal-injury suit against Forecast and Master 
Overhead Door Co., the Riverside firm that installed the garage doors. Master 
Overhead officials could not be reached for comment. The company's phone was 
recently disconnected.

PROGRESS ON CUTTING BUDGET DEFICIT TOLD BY NEGOTIATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiators for the Administration and Congress said Tuesday night that they 
had finally made major strides toward an agreement on cutting next year's 
federal budget deficit, even as President Bush told the nation that success in 
their marathon deliberations is critical to U.S. goals in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats involved in the negotiations offered to make further reductions in 
domestic spending proposals, and the two sides narrowed the gap between their 
plans for military spending as they attempted to cut next year's deficit by as 
much as $50 billion and save up to $500 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The movement occurred as Bush appealed to Congress in a televised address to 
present him a deficit reduction package by the end of the month. But, adding a 
new element to his demand for an agreement, the President, a former oil company 
owner, insisted that Congress should adopt his proposals to provide tax breaks 
for domestic energy production and open up Alaskan wilderness areas to oil and 
gas exploration. 
</P>
<P>
"The gulf situation helps us realize we are more economically vulnerable than 
we ever should be," Bush said. "Americans must never again enter any crisis -- 
economic or military -- with an excessive dependence on foreign oil and an 
excessive burden of federal debt." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike last month, when Bush assailed Democrats in Congress as having caused 
the budget impasse, the President adopted a tone of bipartisan goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
"To revitalize our leadership capacity, we must address our budget deficit," 
Bush told lawmakers, "not after election day or next year, but now. 
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful, in fact, I am confident, the Congress will do what it should," 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
But, although Republican and Democratic negotiators made significant progress 
at their budget summit talks Tuesday, they still remained tens of billions of 
dollars apart on spending cuts and locked in a dispute over who should bear the 
burden of tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides put substantial new proposals on the bargaining table at secluded 
Andrews Air Force Base Tuesday. And the previously pessimistic mood of 
participants improved markedly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic," said Sen. Wyche Fowler (D-Ga.), one of the bargainers. "We're 
going to try hard to finish as soon as we can." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on the positive side of the mood swing," White House Chief of Staff John 
H. Sununu told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the summit participants recessed the talks to hear Bush's speech, they 
scheduled a sixth consecutive day of negotiations today and planned to work 
daily at the isolated air base until they achieve a breakthrough on a deficit 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Without action, next year's budget shortage could exceed $250 billion, compared 
with the $64-billion deficit target called for under the Gramm-Rudman budget 
law. 
</P>
<P>
If no deal is struck by Oct. 1, Gramm-Rudman threatens to force roughly $100 
billion of automatic spending reductions that congressional leaders and 
Administration officials have said would cripple federal services and result in 
unpaid furloughs for nearly all U.S. government workers. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers, with White House support, plan to revise the Gramm-Rudman law after 
a deficit accord is reached, easing the targets and extending the timetable for 
achieving a balanced budget. 
</P>
<P>
The talks grew serious late Monday night, participants said, continuing until 
1:30 a.m. Tuesday to consider a new GOP proposal in response to significant 
Democratic concessions earlier that evening. They were resumed briefly after 
breakfast to allow the Democrats to present another plan for consideration by 
the Republican team. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators still have to climb "the large part of the mountain," one 
Republican negotiator said, comparing progress to date with overcoming only the 
foothills. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement is possible this week, one participant said, but another thought 
that "it's going to take several more days." 
</P>
<P>
In a major move, Democrats offered to cut domestic spending by $100 billion 
over five years, including a doubling of their proposed reductions in benefit 
programs, such as Medicare, to nearly $14 billion next year. 
</P>
<P>
However, Republican negotiators rebuffed the proposal, saying that it would 
slice only $77 billion to $90 billion off the deficit, and stuck to their goal 
of a $120-billion to $130-billion cut between now and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans proposed linking Medicare premiums to income, so that, under one 
plan, the present $28.60 monthly fee would rise to nearly $115 a month for the 
most affluent retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers remained wary of raising Medicare fees so sharply, however, out 
of fear that it could generate a public backlash similar to the one that forced 
Congress to repeal the 1988 catastrophic care law, which boosted fees paid by 
higher-income elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats incorporated a lesser version of the Medicare fee plan, first 
suggested by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), in their own proposals and suggested 
cuts in payments to doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, the Democrats and Republicans moved toward a plan to cut next 
year's $300-billion Pentagon budget by between $10 billion and $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats scaled back their proposed five-year cut from an initial $265 billion 
to roughly $200 billion. Republicans countered with a $170-billion figure, 
leaving the two sides with a $30-billion gap on military spending. 
</P>
<P>
On revenue increases, sources said both sides agreed to raise an extra $25 
billion in the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1 and a total of $130 billion in 
taxes in the coming five-year period. But they clashed sharply over how to meet 
the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans are adamant that any deal include a cut in capital gains taxes -- 
which they argue would bring in more federal revenue and spur economic growth. 
But Democrats remain opposed to the Republican proposal to lower the tax on 
investment profits to 15%, calling it an unwarranted tax break for the 
wealthiest Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats no longer are pushing for an increase in the top tax rate to 35%, one 
aide suggested, but they still want to raise taxes for the wealthy by imposing 
a 10% tax surcharge on incomes above $500,000 and introducing a stiff luxury 
tax on jewelry, furs and high-priced automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
In an official Democratic reply to Bush's address, House Majority Leader 
Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri insisted that average Americans should not be 
asked to bear most of the burden of closing the budget gap through higher 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as we must ask wealthy nations to pay their fair share to deter 
aggression, so we must ask wealthy Americans to pay their fair share to prevent 
recession and reduce our debts." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in his speech, hinted that he may finally be willing to bargain with 
Democrats by accepting slightly higher income taxes on the rich in exchange for 
a cut in capital gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The budget package, Bush said, "must avoid any measure that would . . . turn us 
back toward the days of punishing income tax rates," a last-minute change in 
the text of his speech, which had originally opposed any move toward "higher 
income tax rates." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats would also like to boost energy taxes, proposing a broad 4% tax on 
all energy products, coupled with a separate 7-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax 
hike. Republicans have offered a plan to increase gasoline taxes slightly.

WITNESS ASSAILS CARPENTER REPUTATION FOR HONESTY; 
</P>
<P>
CORRUPTION TRIAL: A STAFF LAWYER SAYS THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION MEMBER MADE 
BIZARRE DECISIONS THAT BENEFITED BUSINESSES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A top lawyer for the State Board of Equalization testified Tuesday that former 
Sen. Paul Carpenter, now a board member, has a bad reputation for honesty among 
the agency's staff. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Jugum, assistant chief counsel for the board, told a federal court jury 
that Carpenter participated in "strange, bizarre" decisions that resulted in 
special tax benefits for certain businesses without any apparent foundation in 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
"They were seemingly without any rational basis," said Jugum. "People were 
concerned that things were happening they considered to be strange." 
</P>
<P>
Jugum was called to the stand by prosecutors as a rebuttal witness to discuss 
Carpenter's reputation at the board, where the former senator has served since 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
The tax attorney was the final witness in Carpenter's trial on four counts of 
racketeering, extortion and conspiracy dating from his days as a Democratic 
state senator from Norwalk. Closing arguments in the trial are to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
Jugum hinted that Carpenter had been influenced in his actions by campaign 
contributions and cited three tax cases that he said had alarmed staff members 
at the Board of Equalization, which administers the state's business taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Jugum said, Carpenter advocated allowing service stations to keep 
taxes improperly collected on the sale of gasohol -- a blend of gasoline and 
alcohol. Jugum said that normally, if the tax could not be returned to 
consumers, it would be claimed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
In the second case, Carpenter favored giving a tax break to America Honda 
Products, which had been assessed taxes for dumping toxic waste on its 
property, Jugum said. Carpenter proposed using a law he had authored as a 
senator that grants an exemption from the hazardous waste tax if the property 
was to be used for low-income housing. However, Jugum testified, there was no 
low-income housing proposed for the site. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he said, Carpenter favored giving a sales tax exemption to publishers 
of Yellow Pages telephone directories under a law that was designed to give a 
tax break to companies that print junk mail. The law had been intended to 
prevent printing firms in California from losing business to printers in other 
states where there was no sales tax, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But under cross-examination by defense attorney Gerard Hinckley, Jugum 
testified that in all three cases, Carpenter was part of a majority on the 
five-member board that voted to grant the exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Jugum acknowledged he had no direct evidence that Carpenter received 
campaign contributions from companies that benefited from the board's actions. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Carpenter finished three days on the witness stand by testifying that 
he wrote a letter of apology to one prosecution witness who had implicated the 
former senator in an attempted extortion of a campaign contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyist Theodore Carthen had testified that he saw Carpenter in 1985 to get 
his support for a bill to help the Charles Drew Postgraduate Medical School of 
Los Angeles. But the senator declined to discuss the bill after Carthen said 
the school could not make contributions, the lobbyist testified. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter said Tuesday that he did not remember the meeting. But after hearing 
the lobbyist's testimony four weeks ago, he said, "I wrote him a letter of 
apology. From his testimony, I thought I had been unforgiveably rude." 
</P>
<P>
He also testified that he swore at lobbyist Jeff Thompson and pounded his desk 
with a campaign contribution report because Thompson had given money to the 
senator's 1984 opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a very spirited discussion with Mr. Thompson," Carpenter said. "I 
believe that I did use some profanity." 
</P>
<P>
But Carpenter denied that he blocked legislation sponsored by Thompson, a 
lobbyist for the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn., in order to 
obtain a campaign contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson had testified earlier in the trial that he was "shaken down for money" 
during the 1986 meeting with Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
After the jury was sent home for the day, U.S. District Judge Edward Garcia 
rejected a defense motion for a mistrial, ruling that there had been no 
misconduct by prosecutors in the Carpenter trial. 
</P>
<P>
Hinckley had charged that prosecutors acted improperly by calling Assemblywoman 
Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) to testify before a grand jury in the ongoing 
federal corruption probe while Carpenter was still on trial. Moore's testimony 
behind closed doors generated news stories that Hinckley argued could prejudice 
the jury.

GULF CRISIS PROMPTS NEW STRATEGY ON OFFSHORE OIL BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
The chief congressional opponents of California offshore oil drilling -- 
reacting in part to political fallout from the Persian Gulf crisis -- have 
suspended efforts to write into law the multiyear drilling moratorium announced 
in June by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Reps. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) and Bill Lowery (R-San Diego) 
are urging colleagues to support another one-year drilling ban for California 
when the House Appropriations Committee considers the 1991 spending bill for 
the Interior Department, perhaps as early as next week. The department handles 
the leasing of offshore drilling tracts. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to both congressmen said Tuesday that they are likely to press for a 
multiyear ban again next year. But they said congressional concerns about 
America's energy dependence, fostered by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, coupled 
with strong opposition from pro-drilling forces, led to the decision to drop 
the matter this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we expected as much opposition as we got," one congressional 
aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where we might have considered taking on the battle under normal 
circumstances, under the current situation (in the Persian Gulf), the answer is 
. . . 'Let's circle the wagons and hold on to what we've got.' " 
</P>
<P>
Michael Matz, a Washington official of the Sierra Club said, "As far as 
codifying the President's announcement (of the drilling moratorium), that will 
be difficult, and the situation in Iraq has undoubtedly contributed to that." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, "I think there is still sufficient support for a one-year 
moratorium." 
</P>
<P>
In a long-anticipated decision, the President on June 26 announced that the 
Interior Department will delay for at least 10 years new oil lease sales off 
most of California, all of southwest Florida, Washington and Oregon, and New 
England north of Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
The President also said new lease sales will be postponed for at least six 
years in a small number of tracts off California where rigs now pump oil. Those 
tracts are in the Santa Barbara Channel and the Santa Maria Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery and Panetta, who has led congressional efforts to enact one-year 
drilling bans off California every year since 1981, had wanted to pass 
legislation giving the President's decision the force of law. Drilling 
opponents argue that further disruption of world oil markets could prompt the 
President to change his mind, or that a new Administration could easily rescind 
Bush's offshore drilling decision. 
</P>
<P>
In July the two California congressmen lost a bid to formalize the multiyear 
drilling ban when the Interior Department bill came before the House 
Appropriations Committee's Interior subcommittee. They had planned to bring the 
matter up again with the full committee, aides to the congressmen said, but 
were dissuaded to a large extent by congressional reaction to events in the 
Persian Gulf. The Senate has not yet considered the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"We still believe the policy makes sense and that it ought to be part of a 
national energy strategy," said Barry J. Toiv, an aide to Panetta. Such a 
strategy must emphasize energy conservation and the development and use of 
alternative fuels and renewable energy sources, Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
At least three separate groups of local environmentalists and coastal community 
officials have traveled to Washington in recent days to lobby for a 
continuation of the annual drilling ban. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a spill, so we know what we're talking about," said Lida Lenney, the 
mayor of Laguna Beach. In February, a tanker that ran aground on its own anchor 
dumped nearly 400,000 gallons of crude oil off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The most severe congressional critic of the annual bans, Rep. Ralph Regula 
(R-Ohio), will not oppose another one-year ban for California and the rest of 
the areas targeted by the President, an aide said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, Regula "has problems" with drilling bans for tracts off North 
Carolina, New Jersey and the Florida Panhandle that were approved by the 
Interior subcommittee but not included in the President's moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Regula said Tuesday that dropping efforts to enact a multiyear moratorium was 
"a wise decision, in light of events" in the Mideast.

ASSAULT CHARGES FILED IN ATTACK ON GIRL; NO RACE CRIMES INCLUDED

Orange County prosecutors Tuesday filed assault and weapons charges against two 
white men, a white juvenile and a black man involved in a street fight last 
month that resulted in near-fatal head injuries to a 15-year-old black Garden 
Grove girl, but ruled out any racial motivation behind the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on Amber Jefferson, a cheerleader at Santiago High School, has 
become a centerpiece for local civil rights activists who have accused 
authorities of foot-dragging during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, speaking at a news conference, harshly 
criticized such community leaders for making the attack a racial issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that various sources will express themselves without being privy 
to the facts," Capizzi said. "It's easy to comment and make statements that 
border on hysteria and get the community upset, but which have no factual 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
Later Tuesday, American Civil Liberties Union attorney Carol Sobel, 
representing the Jefferson family, criticized the outcome of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very disappointed that no race crimes have been charged and that (one) 
of Amber's friends has been charged," she said. "I have read the D.A.'s account 
of the events and we simply do not agree with them." 
</P>
<P>
Amber was injured after midnight on Aug. 7 when she and friends returned to a 
condominium complex in Stanton, where she was staying with a friend. A white 
girl in her group confronted another white girl, and the two argued. Suddenly, 
two young white men appeared with baseball bats; some of the blacks with Amber 
grabbed 2-by-4 boards, and a fight broke out. Before it ended, 12 people were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
The left side of Amber's head was split open by a shard of broken glass. 
Surgeons had to wire her jaw shut because of the injury. Amber's family learned 
from doctors who operated on her for more than 10 hours that her head injuries 
were almost fatal. 
</P>
<P>
When the Sheriff's Department presented its investigation to county prosecutors 
two weeks ago, it listed hate crime violations as "possible charges that may be 
considered." 
</P>
<P>
After a thorough review of the state's race hatred statutes, prosecutors 
decided against filing such charges. 
</P>
<P>
The only one of the four to face felony charges is a 17-year-old white youth, 
who was not identified because of his age. He is accused of throwing the glass 
that split the left side of Amber's head. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, who has been in custody on a probation violation since shortly after 
the incident, faces charges of mayhem, assault with a deadly weapon, infliction 
of great bodily injury and battery. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged was his father, Earl Wimberly, 42, accused of misdemeanor assault 
and exhibiting a deadly weapon. A third white charged is Trevor McClure, 21, 
accused of exhibiting a deadly weapon and challenging to fight. The only black 
charged was Louis Jones, 19, a member of Amber's group, who is accused of 
fighting in public and malicious mischief, both misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said that while some racial slurs were made by some of the whites 
against the blacks, "it did not escalate" to the level of a violation of the 
race hatred statute. 
</P>
<P>
"Racism was not the cause of the fight or of Amber's injuries," Capizzi said. 
He characterized the incident as "a street brawl" that started with two white 
girls fighting over a boy. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said one of Amber's friends said he had been encouraged by others in 
the group to claim the incident was racially motivated because he could make 
money from a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi also said Amber's group had been drinking in a motel earlier that night 
and returned to the complex specifically to confront the other side in a fight.

British investigators issued their first official report on the 1988 bombing of 
a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland in which they recommended that aircraft be 
strengthened to withstand bomb blasts. In its report, which concentrated on 
technical matters, the British Transport Department's Air Accidents 
Investigation Branch also recommended improvements in the manufacture of 
planes' flight-recording systems, saying the recorders aboard Pan Am Flight 103 
did not have any record of the explosion. A team of 15 inspectors worked for 
months reconstructing the Boeing 747 that was destroyed above Lockerbie, 
Scotland, by a bomb, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.

2 NORTHRIDGE TEEN-AGERS FACE MURDER TRIAL IN DEATH OF PASTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Northridge college student, accused of gunning down a Pacoima pastor because 
his friend feared that the minister would report a minor traffic accident to 
police, told detectives that he fired the gun after the pastor laughed and 
said, "Are you really going to shoot me?" according to testimony Monday in San 
Fernando Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The student, Dana L. Singer, 18, also told detectives after his arrest that his 
best friend, Philip J. Dimenno, 19, of Northridge, believed "The only way he 
could take care of this was to get rid of the guy," prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The case last month provoked outrage among ministers and community activists in 
the northeast San Fernando Valley because the defendants, who are white, were 
granted an unusually low bail of $20,000 each in the death of a black man. The 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office was accused of "lethal racism" in 
recommending the low bail. 
</P>
<P>
The bail was revoked a day after it was granted, and the district attorney's 
office changed its policies to require high-level approval of all bail 
recommendations of less than $250,000 in murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
After a preliminary hearing Tuesday that lasted less than two hours, Singer and 
Dimenno were ordered to stand trial on charges they murdered Carl White, 54, 
who was the pastor of the Apostolic Temple Church. The two had gone to White's 
Chatsworth house on July 28 to demand that he return slips of paper bearing 
Dimenno's driver's license information, which Dimenno had given the pastor the 
previous night after the two men's vehicles collided on Winnetka Avenue in 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Dimenno told police that he feared he would be arrested on an outstanding 
traffic warrant if White reported the accident to police. 
</P>
<P>
Singer said Dimenno asked him to accompany him to the pastor's house because "I 
was the only person he could call, being his best friend." Singer, who was not 
with Dimenno when the traffic collision occurred, said he knew something was 
wrong when Dimenno sent a "911" message to Singer's beeper after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Dimenno told Singer in a telephone conversation that he had had an accident and 
that "his life was over," Singer told police. 
</P>
<P>
Singer made the remarks in a written statement to police and during a 
tape-recorded police interview after his arrest in Reseda on July 31, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth L. Barshop. Singer also told police that he fired 
the 9mm pistol because he believed White was becoming aggressive during the 
dispute in the minister's house. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he didn't know what White was going to do -- if he was going to grab 
Mr. Dimenno or not," Los Angeles Police Detective Daniel Carnahan testified 
during the preliminary hearing for Singer and Dimenno Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Singer told police that he fired one round at White, striking the pastor in the 
back of the head. White's body was not discovered until the following day after 
members of his congregation became concerned when he failed to appear for 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Dimenno told police that he returned to White's house after the shooting to 
retrieve the piece of paper bearing Dimenno's name, address and other 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Gerald T. Richardson on Tuesday ordered Singer and Dimenno held 
without bail. He ordered the two to be arraigned Sept. 25 in San Fernando 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Three days after the arrests, the district attorney's office persuaded a judge 
to revoke the $20,000 bail after investigators learned that Singer and Dimenno 
had previously been cited for carrying a concealed weapon in a city park and 
may have been involved in credit card fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Singer and Dimenno were arrested while trying to use White's credit card to 
purchase wheels at an Apollo Tire store in Reseda. Store employee Juan Padilla 
testified Tuesday he called police when the two returned to the store after an 
earlier attempt to buy wheels was declined by the credit card issuer. 
</P>
<P>
Carnahan testified that a search of Singer's car produced three apparently 
falsified temporary driver's licenses. The papers may have been used in other 
credit card frauds, investigators said.

The California Lottery said it will start celebrating its fifth anniversary 
next week by turning 20 people into instant millionaires for matching three of 
six winning numbers in the Lotto 6/53 game. Normally, the prize for picking 
three winning numbers is $5. 
</P>
<P>
Ten people who select three of six numbers in the Sept. 19 drawing will be 
awarded $1 million apiece, and 10 more will get $1 million each in the Sept. 22 
drawing, lottery marketing director Susan Clark said. Winners of the "3 for a 
Million" anniversary bonus will be picked at random from the pool of all 
gamblers who match three of the six winning numbers in the two drawings. On 
average, 185,000 people match three of six numbers in each Lotto drawing. The 
bonus prizes will be awarded in addition to the regular Lotto 6/53 jackpots. A 
winning ticket will be worth $1 million if the ticket's validation number 
matches one of the 10 validation numbers that will be randomly selected by 
computer.

HARTLEY CAN'T BEAR TO WATCH AS PADRES STYMIE DODGERS, 4-0; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE GIVES UP A HOME RUN TO CLARK, AND L.A. FALLS INTO A TIE FOR SECOND 
PLACE, SEVEN GAMES BEHIND THE REDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The moment the fly ball by Jack Clark hit the wall behind the left-field fence, 
Mike Hartley made a decision probably shared by Dodger teammates and 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
He decided he could no longer bear to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Turning his back to home plate, Hartley stared into the sky. As Clark slowly 
rounded the bases behind Tony Gwynn and then stomped on home plate to give the 
San Diego Padres a 2-0 fourth-inning lead, Hartley continued to stare. 
</P>
<P>
When Hartley finally turned to face home plate, it was as if the future of the 
Dodgers had turned as dark as that sky. The Cincinnati Reds had already 
defeated Houston, and soon the Dodgers would lose to Bruce Hurst's five-hitter, 
4-0, before 13,758 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
What was once a single vision toward first place has become a backward glance 
toward third. Besides falling seven games behind the National League 
West-leading Reds with 20 games remaining, the Dodgers also fell into a 
second-place tie with victorious San Francisco, 
</P>
<P>
If the Reds go 11-11 in their final games, the Dodgers must go 17-3 to tie 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Crews put the Dodgers' chances into simpler terms. 
</P>
<P>
"The only possible way is for us to win here (today), then sweep them in 
Cincinnati," he said. "Anything other than that, and I don't see anything 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Crews paused. "But if we do sweep them and get three games back, you never 
know," he said. "Panic could set in." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who lost for the sixth time in their last nine games including two 
consecutive games at San Diego, are not playing as if panicked. Rather, it is 
as if they calmly awoke after last weekend's two emotional victories over the 
Reds and realized that they have never been sound enough to win a championship. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday they lost with a starting pitcher who is actually a reliever and 
with reserves playing first base and center field because of injuries to 
starters. In Monday's loss, they played with a backup catcher and two backup 
outfielders. In both games, they used relief pitchers recently recalled from 
the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it is, but they just looked flat to me the last two days," 
Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers were stifled not just by Hurst, but by a poor encore to the best 
game of rookie pitcher Hartley's pro career. 
</P>
<P>
Five days after pitching a three-hit shutout against Atlanta, he did not last 
past the fifth inning, giving up four runs and five hits in 4 2/3 innings. He 
walked two, both of whom scored, and threw a wild pitch that also led to a run. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley tried so hard, he strained his left side on his final pitch of the 
game. Yet in two of his last three starts, Hartley has not lasted more than 
five innings and now is 6-3 with a 2.95 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good, but I was on and off," Hartley said. "Right now, all we can do is 
scratch or claw or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers were shut out for only the fourth time since the All-Star break, 
the eighth time this season. But then, they haven't had a stretch of games this 
bad since the break. 
</P>
<P>
They were forced to play without Eddie Murray, who was sidelined because of a 
sore left hand, and Kal Daniels, who is still bothered by a strained muscle in 
his side. Jose Offerman started at shortstop in place Alfredo Griffin, who has 
six hits in his last 49 at-bats and is struggling again in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson, the one Dodger slugger who was healthy, struck out three times and 
went hitless in four at-bats, making him hitless in his last 24. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda: "You know Eddie's wrist had to be killing him, 
or he would be in there . . . and you know Kal has been hurting . . . and Gibby 
just can't seem to buy a hit . . . so what can you do? It's just a damn shame 
that we win two out of three against the Reds and then come down here and do 
this. A damn shame." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons removed a small piece of torn cartilage from Tim Belcher's right 
shoulder, found no further damage and said chances are good that Belcher will 
be ready for spring training in 1991. "The news is certainly good," said Fred 
Claire, Dodger vice president. "I talked to Tim and I know he is very 
relieved." . . . Ray Searage was activated from the disabled list, where he had 
been since Aug. 18 because of a sore left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was originally announced that Eddie Murray suffered an injured 
wrist while scooping a ball out of the dirt Sept. 6, apparently Murray's wrist 
had been sore before that, and he aggravated it on the play. . . . Kal Daniels 
said doctors told him that only complete rest would cure his strained left 
side, something which he will not get until after the season. 
</P>
<P>
Claire said that "three or four" more players from triple-A Albuquerque will be 
joining the Dodgers when they finish their Pacific Coast League finals series 
against Edmonton, which could be as soon as tonight. Possible recalls include 
pitcher John Wetteland, catcher Carlos Hernandez and third baseman Dave Hansen. 
. . . Left-handed relief pitcher Pat Perry, who has not been in a game since 
June 2, said he has received indications that he might not be kept on the 
40-man roster, meaning he would become a free agent.

LANGSTON FINALLY GETS SHUTOUT; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE THROWS A FOUR-HITTER IN THE ANGELS' 9-0 VICTORY OVER THE TWINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Langston's mastery of the Minnesota Twins Tuesday night came far too late 
to affect the American League West division race, but the rediscovery of his 
poise and control has come in time for him to grab a few shreds of hope from an 
otherwise dreadful season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just been a real flustrating year. It hasn't gone too well from my 
standpoint, and the one thing I want to do is finish strong and come out next 
year and be more aggressive," Langston said after he and the Angels overpowered 
the Twins, 9-0, before a crowd of 21,908. It was only his third victory in 15 
starts this season at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to finish consistent and let the team behind me know I can do the 
job and get a little confidence in myself. I'll be able to block this season 
out as quick as possible and work very hard over the winter and be ready next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Langston (9-16) allowed four hits, struck out six and walked one in earning the 
fourth victory in his last five decisions and his first shutout since Sept. 17, 
1989, when he was with the Montreal Expos and defeated the New York Mets, 1-0. 
The shutout, achieved on 102 pitches in 2 hours 19 minutes, was also his first 
in the league since April 8, 1989, when he was with Seattle and beat the 
Angels, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
"That was perfect. Just great," Manager Doug Rader said. "He changed speeds 
well and had a nice ratio of balls to strikes. . . . I think he's finally 
starting to feel better about everything, and that's great. He's persevered and 
worked his tail end off, and I'm very happy for him." 
</P>
<P>
Rader had much to be happy about. The Angels scored twice in the first inning 
off starter Kevin Tapani (11-7), who left after three innings to protect a 
strained rib-cage muscle that had prevented him from pitching since Aug. 13. 
They scored again in the fourth on Jack Howell's run-scoring single off Roy 
Smith. They pulled away in the fifth on Johnny Ray's double-play grounder and 
Dave Winfield's two-run home run to center, the 373rd home run of his career, 
and made it a romp in the ninth when Kirby Puckett misplayed Luis Polonia's 
single for two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis ended a one-for-27 slump with three hits and an RBI, but in the 
night's lone negative note, he aggravated the sore back that sidelined him for 
five games last week and his status is day to day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is for all the times we didn't score for (Langston). Now we're even," 
Winfield joked. "We're just playing loose, getting hits and playing good ball. 
Home cooking, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield, who was three for four Monday and two for four Tuesday, credited his 
resurgence to adjustments he has made at the urging of hitting instructor Deron 
Johnson. He also credited, as he called it, "that announcement July 30," 
referring to Commissioner Fay Vincent's sanctions against former New York 
Yankee general partner George Steinbrenner. Before that announcement, Winfield 
was hitting .231 with 37 RBIs. In 34 games since then, he's hitting .320 (40 
for 125) for an overall average of .259, with 22 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I got an emotional boost at that point," Winfield said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Langston is getting an emotional boost from his strong finish, although he 
won't permit himself to think about how different the season might have been 
for him and the Angels if he had pitched this well. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened and I'm disappointed with the way it's turned out, but I just look 
forward. I can't do anything about what happened in the past," he said. "The 
flustrating part is we know we're such a better team than the way we've 
played." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
A decision on Manager Doug Rader, whose contract expires after this season, is 
unlikely before Friday. General Manager Mike Port had said he would confer with 
Rader this week to discuss plans for next season, but Port is attending owners' 
meetings in Pittsburgh and won't return until late Thursday. No meeting between 
the two has been set, and Rader declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Bichette was miffed to see his name omitted from the groups of hitters 
for batting practice Tuesday, although he was told it was inadvertent. "They 
don't even know I'm here," he said. . . . Kirk McCaskill plans to complete the 
season rather than move up his elbow surgery, which is scheduled for the 
off-season. "It's important for me to finish because I've been hurt two of the 
last three years and it wouldn't be very good for my career to make it three 
out of four," said McCaskill, who will have bone spurs removed from his right 
elbow. "Plus, I'm still able to pitch. (Continuing) isn't threatening my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Hill was reinstated off the disabled list although his sprained left 
wrist is too sore for him to hit. He was available as a defensive replacement. 
. . . Max Venable sprained his right ankle in a fall down stairs at home 
Tuesday and was unavailable. . . . Devon White has had more than 100 strikeouts 
for the third time in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' Quad Cities farm club won the Class-A Midwest League title, but 
Boise lost in the Class-A Northwest League finals to Spokane, which is owned by 
the family of Angel broadcaster Ken Brett. The Angels' triple-A Edmonton club 
has lost the first two games of the best-of-five Pacific Coast League 
championship series with the Dodgers' Albuquerque club. . . . Larry Casian, who 
attended Lakewood High School and Cal State Fullerton, will make his first 
major league start tonight for Minnesota.

EVEN DEFEAT CAN BE FUN FOR ROOKIE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Call this one a rookie faux pas. Certainly, Bern Brostek was the only player in 
the Rams' locker room Sunday talking about how much fun he had during the 36-24 
loss to Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous as heck at first, but it was really fun," Brostek said. 
</P>
<P>
Brostek committed some rookie mistakes on the field as well, but the Rams' 
first draft choice made a good impression on the right people during his NFL 
debut. At the University of Washington, he was a four-year starter at center. 
With the Rams, he is a one-game starter at right guard. 
</P>
<P>
And depending on how quickly Joe Milinichik rebounds from thumb surgery, 
Brostek might get another start. 
</P>
<P>
"He missed some things and all that, but it was a physical performance," Coach 
John Robinson said. "We clearly have a really good player. We put him in his 
first NFL game in a position he didn't know anything about, and he performed 
pretty well. That's a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
Brostek did have the advantage of four days of practice at guard and found out 
Saturday night that he would be the starter. So who needs to sleep the night 
before a football game? 
</P>
<P>
"I was tossing and turning, thinking about my plays," Brostek said. "I was just 
praying I would remember my assignments." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, he missed some, but he did an impressive job of slamming his 
6-foot-3, 295-pound body into a good portion of the Packers' defensive front. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had 11 players in Sunday's starting lineup who were either not on the 
team, not starters or started in a different position on opening day last 
season: tight end Pat Carter, right tackle Duval Love, running back Gaston 
Green, punter Keith English, defensive tackle Brian Smith, inside linebackers 
Frank Stams and Fred Strickland, cornerbacks Bobby Humphery and Mickey Sutton, 
free safety Anthony Newman and Brostek. JOHN WEYLER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
YANKEES' 5-4 VICTORY ENDS BOBBY WITT'S WINNING STREAK AT 12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
During his 12-game winning streak, Bobby Witt was defeating pennant contenders 
such as Oakland, Boston and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
But the Texas Ranger pitcher's streak ended Tuesday against the team with the 
worst record in the American League -- the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Hall delivered a two-out, two-run triple in the eighth inning Tuesday night 
at New York to bring the Yankees from behind for a 5-4 victory. It ended the 
Yankees' five-game losing streak and the Rangers' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second victory in the last 12 games for the Yankees, who had 
been beaten seven times in a row by the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, who has one of the best fastballs in the game, had been mostly a 
disappointment to the Rangers after a promising beginning in 1986 when he was 
only 21. 
</P>
<P>
All that changed after a loss to Seattle June 17. In 15 starts, he had three 
no-decisions and won all the rest. He beat Oakland in a game in which he struck 
out 10 and walked 10. 
</P>
<P>
Witt had given up two earned runs or less in nine of his previous 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
He had a 2-1 lead and was trying for his first walk-free game in 137 starts 
before walking Kevin Maas to open the seventh. Hall singled and the runners 
advanced on a sacrifice. With two out, Jim Leyritz singled them home. In 59 
at-bats with runners in scoring position, he has only 10 hits. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers regained the lead in the top of the eighth when Kevin Reimer 
tripled to drive in one run and scored the other on Rafael Palmeiro's single. 
</P>
<P>
Witt's other walk to Roberto Kelly with one out in the bottom of the inning 
started his downfall. Steve Sax singled, and with two out, Hall's drive was 
just beyond right fielder Ruben Sierra's outstretched glove. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I let the team down after they battled back to get me the lead," Witt 
(15-9) said. "I'm disappointed in myself. You want to go out there and stop 
them and I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 8, Kansas City 4 -- Tony Fernandez hit a grand slam in the second 
inning at Kansas City and the Blue Jays went on to win their sixth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays have pulled to within three games of the faltering Red Sox in the 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 4, Boston 2 -- Robin Yount, who had three hits to beat the Red Sox in 
the second game of the doubleheader at Boston Monday night, hit a two-run home 
run in the eighth inning to break a 2-2 tie in this game. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Robinson (10-3) gave up four hits and one earned run in seven innings for 
his sixth consecutive victory. Dennis Lamp, a reliever replacing ailing Roger 
Clemens, held the Brewers to two singles in five innings in his first start in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 4, Chicago 3 -- The White Sox lost for the fifth time in six games on 
a bloop double by Brook Jacoby with two out in the ninth inning at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Barry Jones (11-3) lost for the second time in two nights. He gave a 
single to Carlos Baerga, then Jacoby's double landed just between shortstop 
Ozzie Guillen and center fielder Lance Johnson. Baerga scored when catcher Ron 
Karkovice dropped the relay as Baerga slid home. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 2, Baltimore 1 -- Alan Trammell returned from a back injury that 
sidelined him Saturday and doubled home two runs in the eighth inning at 
Baltimore to bring the Tigers from behind. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Finley's second home run had given the Orioles a 1-0 lead in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 10, Seattle 2 -- At Seattle, Rickey Henderson had another big game and 
the Athletics increased their lead in the West to 10 games by winning their 
seventh in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics had a 3-2 lead when Henderson, who stole three bases, singled in 
two runs to trigger a seven-run rally.

TOMLIN REMAINS A PLEASANT SURPRISE FOR PIRATES, 5-1

<P>
Rookie Randy Tomlin, who won a big game against the New York Mets last week, 
came through with another fine performance Tuesday night at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Tomlin gave up five hits and a run in six innings and for the second game in a 
row, Bobby Bonilla delivered the key hit as the Pirates beat the Phillies, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
The ninth victory in their last 11 games left the Pirates 3 1/2 games in front 
of the New York Mets in the National League East. The teams open a two-game 
series in New York tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Tomlin (3-2), who came up from double A a month ago, also contributed to the 
attack. With one out in the third and the Pirates trailing, 1-0, Tomlin, 
hitless in 18 at-bats, doubled. A triple by Wally Backman tied the score and 
Bonilla's single put the Pirates ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
In eight starts since coming up from Harrisburg, Tomlin has an earned-run 
average of 2.10. He has not given up more than two runs in any outing. He beat 
the Mets, 7-1, giving up three hits and going the distance. Originally, the 
Pirates brought him up to pitch one game. He beat the Phillies, 10-1, and 
hasn't left. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd McClendon, picked off the waiver list Friday, hit a two-run homer for the 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
"All I try to do is what (Pirate pitching coach) Ray Miller tells me to do -- 
work fast, throw strikes and change speeds," Tomlin said. "That's what I did 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jim Leyland brought in Neal Heaton, usually a starter, for two shutout 
innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
New York 10, St. Louis 8 -- Just give the Mets their home field and throw 
right-handers at them and they are sensational. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry, who fell apart on the road last week against left-handers, 
tagged right-hander Lee Smith for a two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth 
to give the Mets their second victory in a row since returning home. 
</P>
<P>
With Cardinal left-hander Joe Magrane unable to pitch because of a back 
problem, the Mets feasted. In two games they scored 20 runs, got 22 hits and 
Strawberry homered in each. 
</P>
<P>
The big test will come tonight when they face left-hander John Smiley and the 
Pirates, who swept them in three games in Pittsburgh to build their lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets are 48-22 at home, including nine in a row. 
</P>
<P>
John Franco (5-1) won after blowing the save. He gave up a double to Milt 
Thompson and singles to Ozzie Smith and rookie Ray Lankford. Pedro Guerrero's 
infield out tied the score. It was only the fourth time Franco failed to get 
his save. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 5, Houston 3 -- Eric Davis needs a cortisone shot in his sore knee 
and Chris Sabo has an aching back, but they want to clinch the West before they 
take time off. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Cincinnati, the ailing Reds took another step toward clinching, 
stretching their lead in the West to seven games before the night was over. 
</P>
<P>
Davis hit his 20th home run and limped around the bases in the second inning. 
Sabo singled home two runs in the third to give the Reds the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Charlton (12-7) gave the Reds a strong seven innings, and Randy Myers 
retired the last five batters for his 29th save. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 2, Atlanta 0 -- Kevin Mitchell took over the league lead in home 
runs in time to get the Giants a victory at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell hit his 34th with a man on in the seventh to break a scoreless tie and 
give the Giants their fourth victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Garrelts (12-10) pitched a strong eight innings but needed help in the 
ninth. He is 6-1 against the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 11, Montreal 6 -- Kevin Gross was sitting pretty at Chicago, after 
being winless in 14 starts in a row. The Expos presented him a 5-0 lead and it 
was only the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't retire a batter in the second inning and lost. There were two things 
unusual about the 10-run inning. All 10 runs scored before an out was made and 
there were no home runs. 
</P>
<P>
There were seven hits, including three two-run doubles and 13 batters in the 
inning. Luis Salazar, who had two singles in the inning, tripled in the final 
run in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs have beaten Gross (8-11) four times. "Here's a guy with a great arm 
and he can't win," Cub Manager Don Zimmer said. DAN HAFNER

Now that the rival factions in Cambodia are moving toward a peace settlement, 
Vietnam's ambassador to the United Nations says the United States should begin 
to normalize relations with his country. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to have relations as soon as possible -- tomorrow, the day 
after tomorrow," Trinh Xuan Lang said in an interview at Vietnam's mission to 
the United Nations. ". . . We are not begging. If the United States is not 
ready, we are prepared to wait. But I think we should not miss this chance." 
</P>
<P>
A senior Bush Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
said this week's progress toward peace in Cambodia "increases the possibility" 
the United States will normalize ties with Vietnam. But he indicated the 
Administration is not ready to take such a step until there is further progress 
toward an end to Cambodia's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Vietnam War ended 15 years ago, the United States has maintained a 
policy of isolating the government in Hanoi. The United States maintains a 
trade embargo against Vietnam and has no diplomatic relations with its 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after Vietnam withdrew most of its troops from Cambodia, the Bush 
Administration said it would be prepared to move toward normal ties with 
Vietnam, but only after the Hanoi government helped to bring about a peace 
settlement in Cambodia. The current government in Phnom Penh was installed when 
Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia at the end of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, at a meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, the four warring parties in 
Cambodia took a historic step toward such a peace settlement when they agreed 
to share power in a Supreme National Council that would run the country until 
the United Nations can arrange a cease-fire and conduct free elections. The 
Cambodian government, headed by Premier Hun Sen, said for the first time that 
it is willing to go along with this power-sharing arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Lang asserted in the interview on Monday that Vietnam has been "doing its best" 
to bring about a peace settlement as soon as possible. "We have spared no 
effort in that direction," he said. As a result, he said, Vietnam has met the 
conditions set by the United States for normal diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether the United States keeps its word in normalizing relations or not, that 
is the decision of the United States," he said. "Conditions are put after 
conditions. . . . We believe there should be normalization of relations between 
the two countries sooner, sooner. Of course, it doesn't depend on one side. It 
depends on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said it is not yet clear how important a role Vietnam 
played in persuading Hun Sen and his Cambodian government to go along with the 
United Nations plan for a sharing of power. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what Vietnam told Hun Sen and what the Soviets told him," the 
official said. "But Jakarta was a significant advance forward, and Vietnam 
didn't obstruct the process. The Vietnamese were certainly not a negative 
factor, and they may have been a positive factor." 
</P>
<P>
Normalization of relations with Vietnam "is not center stage on the U.S. agenda 
right now," the official said. However, he added, "we would move step by step 
with them toward normalization as they help make this (the proposed Cambodian 
peace settlement) work." 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe Vietnam is eager to forge new ties with the United States 
because of its need for Western investment to shore up its impoverished economy 
and because of its fear of losing aid from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lang argued that normalizing U.S.-Vietnamese relations would be "in 
the interest of both countries, politically and economically." 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. objective in Southeast Asia is peace, stability and security of the 
whole area. We also have the same objective," Lang said. "Secondly, in the 
economic field, I believe the United States could have quite considerable 
interests in Vietnam -- for example, in the oil and gas industry and many other 
fields." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Bush Administration opened direct talks with Vietnam but said 
these talks must be confined exclusively to the subject of Cambodia. Lang, who 
has been at the United Nations for two years, is representing Vietnam in those 
talks. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kenneth M. Quinn represents the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Lang, who has met with Quinn twice so far, said he hopes these talks "may be 
considered the beginning of the process of normalization. But it depends on the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official countered that normalization of ties between the two 
countries "will be a function of how the Vietnamese are helpful" on Cambodia. 
For example, he said, "Vietnam still has thousands of advisers in Cambodia. As 
part of the peace process, they will have to leave the country."

BIDEN CALLS FOR QUIZZING SOUTER ON RIGHTS, ABORTION, RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter will be grilled with "specific questions" 
about his views on abortion, civil rights and religion during his confirmation 
hearings, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"At this fateful moment in our history, we have a right to know -- and a duty 
to discover -- precisely what David Hackett Souter thinks about the great 
constitutional questions of our time," Biden said in a speech to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Souter's record offers "more blank spaces than answers," yet his appointment 
could result in a profound change in the legal treatment of abortion and 
privacy, Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
"In such cases, detailed and thorough questioning is the only way that the 
Senate's consent to a nomination can be deemed 'informed consent,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Biden's speech, coming two days before Souter's confirmation hearings begin on 
Thursday, sought to justify going much further than before in interrogating 
high court nominees. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, during the battle over the nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork, the 
Senate debated whether a nominee's philosophy, as opposed to his experience and 
intellect, was a valid basis for evaluating his suitability for a seat on the 
court. Democrats settled that debate by voting down Bork because of his 
conservative ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the Souter nomination, the key issue is whether the Senate can force 
a nominee to reveal his philosophy in order to be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"The burden of proof is on the nominee, as it is on us, when we seek election 
as senators," Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
"A nominee (to the Supreme Court) must persuade the Senate that he or she is 
the person in whose hands we should agree to vest awesome power and 
responsibility," Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Planned Parenthood Federation released a poll of 1,000 voters 
suggesting that most Americans agree with Biden's approach. 
</P>
<P>
By a 76%-20% margin, those surveyed said it would be "appropriate for the 
Senate to question a Supreme Court nominee on his personal views on privacy, 
separation of church and state, abortion and civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
The National Organization for Women became the first group to officially oppose 
Souter. "Souter seeks the 'original intent' of the framers of the 18th Century, 
a time when all blacks were slaves and women were the property of husbands," 
NOW President Molly Yard said.

THREE GIVEN MAXIMUM TERMS IN JOGGER ATTACK; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: TEEN-AGERS TO SERVE FIVE TO 10 YEARS FOR ASSAULT AND RAPE OF WOMAN IN 
CENTRAL PARK. THE DEFENSE CLAIMS COURT PROCEEDINGS WERE BIASED.

<P>
Declaring they had turned Central Park into a "torture chamber," a State 
Supreme Court Justice on Tuesday sentenced three teen-agers to the maximum term 
of five to 10 years in prison for assaulting and raping a woman jogger. 
</P>
<P>
People in New York City have the right to "freedom to walk and to be secure in 
their homes," said Justice Thomas B. Galligan. The defendants, he added, had 
shown "no remorse, only defiance." 
</P>
<P>
He labeled as "astounding" the level of violence in the park on the night of 
April 19, 1989, when the jogger and others were attacked randomly by a gang of 
more than 30 youths. "Central Park was turned into a torture chamber by 
mindless marauders seeking a thrill," the judge said angrily. 
</P>
<P>
All three defendants spoke briefly, and defiantly. 
</P>
<P>
Yusef Salaam, accused of striking the jogger in the head with a metal pipe, 
read a rap poem in which he compared himself to Nelson Mandela and Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. as a victim of white oppression 
</P>
<P>
"I told the truth. I think my debt to society has been paid," Salaam said. 
"This is my debt for being a black man." 
</P>
<P>
Salaam told the judge the entire court proceedings were a "legal lynching." 
</P>
<P>
"I know I was convicted of crimes me and my co-defendants never committed," 
added Salaam, the only defendant to take the witness stand during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows I am innocent of this crime," Raymond Santana told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Defendant Antron McCray thanked his family for supporting him. "I'm gonna make 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the seriousness of the charges, the teen-agers were tried as adults. 
But Galligan had to sentence them as juveniles because they were under 16 when 
the jogger was assaulted. If sentenced as adults, they could have received from 
8 1/3 to 25 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 days of deliberations, a jury acquitted Salaam and McCray, both 16, 
and Santana, 15, of the top charge of attempted murder, but found all three 
defendants guilty of assault, rape, rioting and lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the defendant's lawyers used the occasion of the sentencing to 
vehemently attack Galligan and the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
"This court lacks the impartiality to rule in this case," charged McCray's new 
lawyer, C. Vernon Mason. "This court was handpicked by Dist. Atty. Robert M. 
Morgenthau. . . . They (the teens) were tried by a lynch mob in a lynch court 
by a specially selected judge." 
</P>
<P>
"That is somebody's imagination," Galligan answered back from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
William M. Kunstler, the new lawyer for Salaam, likened the court to "Alabama 
in 1932." 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced what occurred here was a legal lynching," he charged, adding 
that he was so sure that Galligan would impose the maximum sentence of five to 
10 years that he had already filled in that sentence in forms for appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll keep that in mind," Galligan said dryly. 
</P>
<P>
At one point supporters of the youths, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, a 
Brooklyn minister without a pulpit who has participated in numerous street 
demonstrations, broke into applause as the defense attorneys spoke, prompting 
Galligan to threaten to clear the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Elizabeth Lederer asked for the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"These defendants found their courage in the size of the gang," she said. "The 
behavior of these defendants is a crime against our society. In the course of 
one hour, these defendants tried to take over a section of the city. . . . 
These defendants displayed no regard for human life." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom when the proceedings were over, Michael Joseph, who 
represented McCray during the trial, questioned the wisdom of attacking a judge 
when a defense lawyer is seeking a smaller than maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Mason) is not assisting Antron McCray," the lawyer said. "He lectured to 
insult the judge."

MAYOR VOWS TO VETO ILLINOIS CITY'S TUITION-TAX PLAN

Efforts to impose a first-in-the-nation tuition tax on college students 
appeared doubtful Tuesday after Mayor Joan Barr vowed to veto a modest but 
symbolically significant levy approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside complaints that such a tax would punish students who are poor 
and would probably be struck down by the courts anyway, the council voted 10 to 
8 late Monday to enact the approximately $15-a-quarter fee. 
</P>
<P>
It would have applied to several thousand students who attend prestigious 
Northwestern University as well as three smaller colleges in this well-heeled 
suburb of 73,000 residents just north of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, including many educators, feared that approval of a tuition tax in 
Evanston might open the floodgates to a wave of copycat taxes in cash-strapped 
college towns across the country. Northwestern had threatened to sue to block 
the tax if it were approved. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the Evanston tax said they lacked the votes in the council to 
override Barr's veto, but they vowed to organize a petition drive to put a 
referendum on the tax question on the ballot during municipal elections next 
April.

Here is the text of President Bush's address to Congress on Tuesday night, as 
released in advance by the White House: 
</P>
<P>
Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the Congress, distinguished guests, 
fellow Americans, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
We gather tonight, witness to events in the Persian Gulf as significant as they 
are tragic. In the early morning hours of August 2nd, following negotiations 
and promises by Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein not to use force, a powerful 
Iraqi army invaded its trusting and much weaker neighbor, Kuwait. Within three 
days, 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait, and moved 
south to threaten Saudi Arabia. It was then I decided to check that aggression. 
</P>
<P>
At this moment, our brave servicemen and women stand watch in that distant 
desert and on distant seas, side-by-side with the forces of more than 20 other 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
They are some of the finest men and women of the United States of America. And 
they're doing one terrific job. 
</P>
<P>
These valiant Americans were ready at a moment's notice to leave their spouses, 
their children, to serve on the front-line halfway around the world. They 
remind us who keeps America strong. They do. 
</P>
<P>
In the trying circumstances of the gulf, the morale of our servicemen and women 
is excellent. In the face of danger, they are brave, well-trained and 
dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
A soldier, Pfc. Wade Merritt of Knoxville, Tenn., now stationed in Saudi 
Arabia, wrote his parents of his worries, his love of family and his hopes for 
peace. But Wade also wrote: "I am proud of my country and its firm stand 
against inhumane aggression. I am proud of my Army and its men . . . I am proud 
to serve my country." 
</P>
<P>
Let me just say, Wade, America is proud of you. And grateful to every soldier, 
sailor, Marine and airman serving the cause of peace in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
I also want to thank the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Powell, 
the chiefs, our commander in the Persian Gulf, General Schwartzkopf, and the 
men and women of the Department of Defense -- what a magnificent job you are 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
I wish I could say their work is done. But we all know it is not. 
</P>
<P>
So if ever there was a time to put country before self and patriotism before 
party, that time is now. Let me thank all Americans, especially those in this 
chamber, for your support for our forces and their mission. 
</P>
<P>
That support will be even more important in the days to come. 
</P>
<P>
So tonight, I want to talk to you about what is at stake -- what we must do 
together to defend civilized values around the world, and maintain our economic 
strength at home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Objectives Are Clear 
</P>
<P>
Our objectives in the Persian Gulf are clear, our goals defined and familiar: 
</P>
<P>
Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately -- and without 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored. 
</P>
<P>
The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured. 
</P>
<P>
American citizens abroad must be protected. 
</P>
<P>
These goals are not ours alone. They have been endorsed by the U.N. Security 
Council five times in as many weeks. Most countries share our concern for 
principle. And many have a stake in the stability of the Persian Gulf. This is 
not, as Saddam Hussein would have it, the United States against Iraq. It is 
Iraq against the world. 
</P>
<P>
As you know, I've just returned from a very productive meeting with Soviet 
President Gorbachev. I am pleased that we are working together to build a new 
relationship. In Helsinki, our joint statement affirmed to the world our shared 
resolve to counter Iraq's threat to peace. Let me quote: "We are united in the 
belief that Iraq's aggression must not be tolerated. No peaceful international 
order is possible if larger states can devour their smaller neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie 
concerted U.N. action against aggression. 
</P>
<P>
A new partnership of nations has begun. 
</P>
<P>
We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian 
Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward a 
historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth 
objective -- a new world order -- can emerge: A new era -- freer from the 
threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the 
quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North 
and South, can prosper and live in harmony. 
</P>
<P>
A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a 
thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor. Today that new world is 
struggling to be born. A world quite different from the one we've known. A 
world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world where the 
rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations 
recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the 
strong respect the rights of the weak. 
</P>
<P>
This is the vision I shared with President Gorbachev in Helsinki. He, and other 
leaders from Europe, the gulf and around the world, understand that how we 
manage this crisis today could shape the future for generations to come. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Test of Mettle 
</P>
<P>
The test we face is great -- and so are the stakes. This is the first assault 
on the new world we seek, the first test of our mettle. Had we not responded to 
this first provocation with clarity of purpose, if we do not continue to 
demonstrate our determination, it would be a signal to actual and potential 
despots around the world. 
</P>
<P>
America and the world must defend common vital interests. And we will. 
</P>
<P>
America and the world must support the rule of law. And we will. 
</P>
<P>
And one thing more -- in pursuit of these goals America will not be 
intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
Vital issues of principle are at stake. Saddam Hussein is literally trying to 
wipe a country off the face of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
We do not exaggerate. 
</P>
<P>
Nor do we exaggerate when we say: Saddam Hussein will fail. 
</P>
<P>
Vital economic interests are at risk as well. Iraq itself controls some 10% of 
the world's proven oil reserves. Iraq plus Kuwait controls twice that. An Iraq 
permitted to swallow Kuwait would have the economic and military power, as well 
as the arrogance, to intimidate and coerce its neighbors -- neighbors who 
control the lion's share of the world's remaining oil reserves. We cannot 
permit a resource so vital to be dominated by one so ruthless. And we won't. 
</P>
<P>
Recent events have surely proven that there is no substitute for American 
leadership. In the face of tyranny, let no one doubt American credibility and 
reliability. 
</P>
<P>
Let no one doubt our staying power. We will stand by our friends. One way or 
another, the leader of Iraq must learn this fundamental truth. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, acting hand-in-hand with others, we've sought to fashion the 
broadest possible international response to Iraq's aggression. The level of 
world cooperation and condemnation of Iraq is unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
Armed forces from countries spanning four continents are there at the request 
of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to deter and if need be to defend against attack. 
Muslims and non-Muslims, Arabs and non-Arabs, soldiers from many nations, stand 
shoulder to shoulder, resolute against Saddam Hussein's ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
We can now point to five United Nations Security Council resolutions that 
condemn Iraq's aggression. They call for Iraq's immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal, the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate government, and 
categorically reject Iraq's cynical and self-serving attempt to annex Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hostage Policy Firm 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the U.S. has demanded the release of all foreign nationals held 
hostage against their will, and in contravention of international law. It is a 
mockery of human decency to call these people "guests." They are hostages, and 
the whole world knows it. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it all: "We do not bargain over hostages. 
We will not stoop to the level of using human beings as bargaining (chips). 
Ever." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, our hearts go out to the hostages and their families. But our policy 
cannot change. And it will not change. America and the world will not be 
blackmailed. 
</P>
<P>
We are now in sight of a United Nations that performs as envisioned by its 
founders. We owe much to the outstanding leadership of Secretary General Perez 
de Cuellar. The U.N. is backing up its words with action. The Security Council 
has imposed mandatory economic sanctions on Iraq, designed to force Iraq to 
relinquish the spoils of its illegal conquest. The Security Council has also 
taken the obvious step of authorizing the use of all means necessary to ensure 
compliance with these sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Together with our friends and allies, ships of the United States Navy are today 
patrolling Mideast waters. They have already intercepted more than 700 ships to 
enforce the sanctions. Three regional leaders I spoke with yesterday (Monday) 
told me that these sanctions are working. Iraq is feeling the heat. 
</P>
<P>
We continue to hope that Iraq's leaders will recalculate just what their 
aggression has cost them. They are cut off from world trade. Unable to sell 
their oil. And only a tiny fraction of goods gets through. 
</P>
<P>
At home, the material cost of our leadership can be steep. That's why Secretary 
of State Baker and Treasury Secretary Brady have met with many world leaders to 
underscore that the burden of this collective effort must be shared. We are 
prepared to do our share and more to help carry that load; we insist that 
others do their share as well. 
</P>
<P>
The response of most of our friends and allies has been good. To help defray 
costs, the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have 
pledged to provide our deployed troops with all the food and fuel they need. 
Generous assistance will also be provided to stalwart front-line nations, such 
as Turkey and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
I am also heartened to report that this international response extends to the 
neediest victims of this conflict -- the refugees. For our part, we have 
contributed $28 million for relief efforts. This is but a portion of what is 
needed. I commend, in particular, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and several European 
nations who have joined us in this humanitarian effort. 
</P>
<P>
There is an energy-related cost to be borne as well. Oil-producing nations are 
already replacing lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti output. More than half of what was 
lost has been made up. We are getting superb cooperation. If producers, 
including the United States, continue steps to expand oil and gas production, 
we can stabilize prices and guarantee against hardship. Additionally, we and 
several of our allies always have the option to extract oil from our strategic 
petroleum reserves, if conditions warrant. As I have pointed out before, 
conservation efforts are essential to keep our energy needs as low as possible. 
We must then take advantage of our energy sources across the board: Coal, 
natural gas, hydro and nuclear. Our failure to do these things has made us more 
dependent on foreign oil that ever before. Finally, let no one even contemplate 
profiteering from this crisis. 
</P>
<P>
I cannot predict just how long it will take to convince Iraq to withdraw from 
Kuwait. Sanctions will take time to have their full intended effect. We will 
continue to review all options with our allies, but let it be clear: We will 
not let this aggression stand. 
</P>
<P>
Our interest, our involvement in the gulf, is not transitory. It predated 
Saddam Hussein's aggression, and will survive it. Long after all our troops 
come home, there will be a lasting role for the United States in assisting the 
nations of the Persian Gulf. Our role, with others, is to deter future 
aggression. Our role is to help our friends in their own self-defense. And 
something else: to curb the proliferation of chemical, biological, ballistic 
missile and above all, nuclear technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Let me also make clear that the United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi 
people. Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator, and with his aggression. Iraq will 
not be permitted to annex Kuwait. That's not a threat, or a boast, that's just 
the way it's going to be. 
</P>
<P>
Our ability to function effectively as a great power abroad depends on how we 
conduct ourselves here at home. Our economy, our armed forces, our energy 
dependence, and our cohesion all determine whether we can help our friends and 
stand up to our foes. 
</P>
<P>
For America to lead, America must remain strong and vital. Our world leadership 
and domestic strength are mutual and reinforcing; a woven piece, as strongly 
bound as Old Glory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Reduce Deficit 
</P>
<P>
To revitalize our leadership capacity, we must address our budget deficit -- 
not after election day, or next year, but now. 
</P>
<P>
Higher oil prices slow our growth, and higher defense costs would only make our 
fiscal deficit problem worse. That deficit was already greater than it should 
have been -- a projected $232 billion for the coming year. It must -- it will 
-- be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
To my friends in Congress, together we must act this very month -- before the 
next fiscal year begins October first -- to get America's economic house in 
order. The gulf situation helps us realize we are more economically vulnerable 
than we ever should be. Americans must never again enter any crisis -- economic 
or military -- with an excessive dependence on foreign oil and an excessive 
burden of federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans are sick and tired of endless battles in the Congress and 
between the branches over budget matters. It is high time we pulled together -- 
and get the job done right. It is up to us to straighten this out. 
</P>
<P>
This job has four basic parts. 
</P>
<P>
First: The Congress should, this month, within a budget agreement, enact 
growth-oriented tax measures -- to help avoid recession in the short term; and 
to increase savings, investment, productivity and competitiveness for the 
longer term. These measures include extending incentives for research and 
experimentation; expanding the use of IRAs for new homeowners; establishing 
tax-deferred family savings accounts; creating incentives for the creation of 
enterprise zones and initiatives to encourage more domestic drilling, and, yes, 
reducing the tax rate for capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
Second: The Congress should, this month, enact a prudent multi-year defense 
program -- one that reflects not only the improvement in East-West relations, 
but our broader responsibilities to deal with the continuing risks of outlaw 
action and regional conflict. Even with our obligations in the gulf, a sound 
defense budget can have some reduction in real terms, and we are prepared to 
accept that. But to go beyond such levels, where cutting defense would threaten 
our vital margin of safety, is something I will never accept. 
</P>
<P>
The world is still dangerous. Surely that is now clear. Stability is not 
secure. American interests are far-reaching. Interdependence has increased. The 
consequences of regional instability can be global. This is no time to risk 
America's capacity to protect her vital interests. 
</P>
<P>
Third: The Congress should, this month, enact measures to increase domestic 
energy production and energy conservation -- in order to reduce dependence on 
foreign oil. These measures should include my proposals to increase incentives 
for domestic oil and gas exploration, fuel-switching, and to accelerate the 
development of Alaskan energy resources, without damage to wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
As you know, when the oil embargo was imposed in the early 1970s, the United 
States imported almost 6 million barrels of oil per day. This year, before the 
Iraqi invasion, U.S. imports had risen to nearly 8 million barrels per day. We 
had moved in the wrong direction. Now we must act to correct that trend. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth: The Congress should, this month, enact a five-year program to reduce 
the projected debt and deficits by $500 billion -- that is, by half a trillion 
dollars. If, with the Congress, we can develop a satisfactory program by the 
end of the month, we can avoid the ax of "sequester" -- deep across-the-board 
cuts that would threaten our military capacity and risk substantial domestic 
disruption. 
</P>
<P>
I want to be able to tell the American people we have truly solved the deficit 
problem. For me to do that, a budget agreement must meet these tests: 
</P>
<P>
It must include the measures I've recommended to increase economic growth and 
reduce dependence on foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
It must be fair. All should contribute, but the burden should not be excessive 
for any one group of programs or people. 
</P>
<P>
It must address the growth of government's hidden liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
It must reform the budget process, and further: It must be real. 
</P>
<P>
I urge Congress to provide a comprehensive five-year deficit reduction program 
to me as a complete legislative package -- with measures to assure that it can 
be fully enforced. America is tired of phony deficit reduction, or promise-now, 
save-later-plans. Enough is enough. It is time for a program that is credible 
and real. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally, to the extent that the deficit reduction program includes new 
revenue measures, it must avoid any measure that would threaten economic growth 
or turn us back toward the days of punishing income tax rates. That is one path 
we should not head down again. 
</P>
<P>
I have been pleased with recent progress, although it has not always seemed so 
smooth. 
</P>
<P>
But now it is time to produce. 
</P>
<P>
I hope we can work out a responsible plan. But with or without agreement from 
the budget summit, I ask both houses of the Congress to allow a straight 
up-or-down vote on a complete $500-billion deficit reduction package -- not 
later than Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
If the Congress cannot get me a budget, then Americans will have to face a 
tough, mandated sequester. 
</P>
<P>
I am hopeful, in fact I am confident, the Congress will do what it should. And 
we in the Executive Branch will do our part. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, our ability to meet our responsibilities abroad depends 
upon political will and consensus at home. This is never easy in democracies -- 
where we govern only with the consent of the governed. And although free people 
in a free society are bound to have their differences, Americans traditionally 
come together in times of adversity and challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Americans have stepped forward to share a tearful goodby with their 
families before leaving for a strange and distant shore. At this very moment, 
they serve together with Arabs, Europeans, Asians and Africans in defense of 
principle and the dream of a new world order. That is why they sweat and toil 
in the sand and the heat and the sun. 
</P>
<P>
If they can come together under such adversity; if old adversaries like the 
Soviet Union and the United States can work in common cause, then surely we who 
are so fortunate to be in this great chamber -- Democrats, Republicans, 
Liberals, Conservatives -- can come together to fulfill our responsibilities 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you, good night, and God Bless America.

GULF WATCH: DAY 41; 
</P>
<P>
A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
President Bush addressed the nation, outlining "what is at stake -- what we 
must do together to defend civilized values around the world." He praised the 
American military and hailed the new level of cooperation between Washington 
and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Japan said it may give $2 billion to the nations hit hardest by U.N. sanctions, 
on top of the $1 billion aid package already promised for multinational 
peacekeeping forces in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hostage Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraq promised to permit Arab-born American males to leave occupied Kuwait with 
American women and children. And the State Department said it has chartered two 
more Iraqi Airways jets to airlift up to 800 Westerners from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, four more countries -- Austria, Bangladesh, Greece and Switzerland 
-- ordered their besieged diplomats to pull out. The U.S. embassy continues to 
hold on. At the western border of Iraq, about 300,000 Egyptians and 70,000 
Asians wait to cross into Jordan. Two Virgin Atlantic aircraft left London with 
supplies for the refugees. One of the planes was due to ferry refugees to Sri 
Lanka and Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi military forces have stepped up activity along the country's borders with 
Turkey and Syria, but there are no signs of imminent hostilities, a Pentagon 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the crisis in the Persian Gulf has sparked 
terrorist threats against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade Front: 
</P>
<P>
The first of the nations to respond to Saddam Hussein's offer of free oil, the 
Philippines and Namibia, said no. But Cuba and Romania have struck oil deals 
with Iraq, and some Eastern European countries are trying to keep up their 
military sales to Iraq, the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crisis Indicators: 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. troops on the ground: 100,000 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. sailors aboard ships in region: 35,000 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. warships in region: 50+ 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. reservists to be mobilized: up to 49,703 
</P>
<P>
* Iraqi troops in/near Kuwait: 265,000 
</P>
<P>
* Iraqi tanks in Kuwait: 1,500 
</P>
<P>
* Total Americans in Kuwait: about 1,500 
</P>
<P>
* Total Americans in Iraq: about 300 
</P>

U.S. PART OF YEAR'S GULF COST PUT AT $7.5 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told a Senate committee Tuesday that a yearlong 
military presence in the Persian Gulf would cost the United States $7.5 billion 
in fiscal 1991 -- enough to wipe out most of the post-Cold War "peace dividend" 
that Congress had hoped to achieve in the year that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Cheney estimated that 
the United States could persuade its allies to pick up half the tab, which he 
said could total $15 billion in fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
That was not enough to satisfy members of the panel, who repeatedly told Cheney 
that they believe the allies should pay more than they have thus far indicated 
they are willing to contribute. They aimed their harshest criticism at West 
Germany and Japan, which they said are making relatively small contributions 
despite the fact that their robust economies are particularly dependent upon 
Persian Gulf oil. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the lives of American boys who are at risk here -- not Japanese and not 
German," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). "We should at least be able to expect 
them to pick up a significant share of the burden." 
</P>
<P>
Others noted that oil-producing countries in the Middle East are enjoying a 
huge surge in revenues as a result of the crisis and contended that they should 
be forced to contribute a greater portion of those earnings to an effort that 
is aimed at guaranteeing their own security. 
</P>
<P>
If the military operation continues through the fiscal year and Cheney's cost 
estimate proves accurate, the commitment would significantly dampen 
expectations that the U.S. government would have big military savings from the 
recent thaw in relations with its old superpower adversary, the Soviet Union. 
Many in Congress had hoped that they could apply the windfall -- known as the 
"peace dividend" -- to deficit reduction or to pressing social concerns such as 
education. 
</P>
<P>
While Democrats hope to preserve the peace dividend by forcing allies to pick 
up a greater share of the costs of the Persian Gulf operation, the 
Administration clearly hopes that Operation Desert Shield has given it leverage 
to stave off deep defense cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's testimony by Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, was the Pentagon's first formal presentation on Capitol Hill 
since the crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
The actual size of next year's defense budget is a critical issue before 
congressional and White House negotiators as they struggle to agree on a budget 
only three weeks before the start of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, for example, had passed a bill shortly after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion 
of Kuwait that envisioned trimming $10 billion from current levels of spending, 
adjusted for inflation. Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) 
noted in an interview that Cheney's forecast suggested that the additional 
costs of the Persian Gulf operation would eliminate three-quarters of that 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
The House is debating legislation that projects even deeper cuts -- slashing 
$24 billion in long-range spending commitments from President Bush's request, 
including a $12-billion reduction in 1991 outlays. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams charged Tuesday that the pending House bill 
would "greatly complicate" Operation Desert Shield and "increase the potential" 
for other regional flare-ups to turn into major crises. 
</P>
<P>
"This proposal, in summary, is simply isolationist and extreme," Williams 
asserted at the daily Pentagon briefing of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's primary objections to the House bill center on a proposed 
130,000-troop reduction, termination of the B-2 Stealth bomber program and 
slashes in "Star Wars" anti-missile research, the C-17 cargo plane, the A-12 
carrier-based attack plane and the Advanced Tactical Fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the magnitude of the troop reduction "would pose an undue risk to 
national security, greatly complicate the department's ability to deal with our 
current crisis in the gulf and also rob the department of the flexibility that 
we need to manage the (troop) drawdown in an effective, responsible way." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also protested the bill's provision to permanently base most 
troops in the United States and rotate them on temporary duty to posts abroad. 
</P>
<P>
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) defended the bill, 
saying his committee had drafted it in a "fiscally responsible manner. Some 
adjustments are required, but nothing that has occurred in the gulf has called 
into question the wisdom of the approach the committee took in July." 
</P>
<P>
Further, he contended that the gulf crisis only emphasizes the wisdom of the 
House bill's spending priorities, which favor lighter tanks and improved sea 
lift and airlift capacity over high-tech equipment more suited to a superpower 
war. 
</P>
<P>
House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) added: "We can and will 
afford weapons critical to efforts like Operation Desert Shield: tanks, 
precision missiles and fast sea lift. But 'Star Wars,' the B-2 bomber and the 
MX missile are costly systems designed for a Cold War that we already won."

ARAB-BORN MALE AMERICAN CITIZENS ALLOWED TO LEAVE; 
</P>
<P>
HOSTAGES: U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THE MOVE COULD REUNITE SCORES OF SEPARATED 
FAMILIES.

<P>
Expanding the exodus of Americans from the Middle East, Iraq has agreed to 
permit Arab-born male U.S. citizens to join women and children in the 
U.S.-backed airlift from occupied Kuwait, the State Department announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A Voice of America broadcast described the accord as an "important 
development," and U.S. officials said the move could reunite scores of American 
families separated as foreign-born husbands were forced to stay behind in 
Kuwait while their wives and children were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department warned, however, that U.S.-born American men still hiding 
in Kuwait "remain subject to detention and arrest" by Iraqi troops. And in 
another grim warning, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney disclosed that the 
five-week crisis has sparked a flurry of terrorist threats. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before Congress, Cheney said pro-Iraqi demonstrations across the 
Middle East have inflamed anti-American sentiment and elevated "the terrorist 
threat to our forces in Saudi Arabia and to U.S. personnel and interests 
worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
The developments on hostages and terrorism came as the Defense Department 
reported an increase in Iraqi military activity along the Syrian and Turkish 
borders, but said it had no indication that hostilities were imminent. 
</P>
<P>
In the Persian Gulf, an estimated 100,000 U.S. troops began firing live 
ammunition as part of their training for a possible military operation against 
Iraq after their Saudi hosts abandoned a restriction that had forced the 
soldiers to fire blanks. 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman said the live firing of the rifles, cannons and artillery, 
authorized under a new agreement between U.S. and Saudi forces that became 
effective Tuesday, was necessary "even though we are in defensive posture." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's relaxation of its restrictions on evacuation from Kuwait was expected to 
open the way for an expanded airlift of Americans stranded in the war zone. The 
United States chartered two Iraqi Airways 747s in the apparent hope of 
evacuating hundreds more Americans by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 U.S. citizens have left Iraq and Kuwait so far, but the State 
Department said Tuesday that 1,700 Americans still remain in Kuwait alone. One 
official said a "significant number" of them are Arab-born men who are 
naturalized U.S. citizens now entitled to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement by Iraq, although limited, marks the first time it has extended 
exit privileges to able-bodied American men. Baghdad had previously permitted 
women, children and the infirm to leave, while decreeing that American men 
would remain involuntary "guests" of Iraq until the current crisis passes. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the turnabout over the Voice of America, the State Department 
said the American men now eligible for departure would include U.S. citizens 
"born in Iraq, Kuwait or another Arab country." 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast, reversing earlier instructions, urged those foreign-born 
citizens to "contact the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait immediately." But it cautioned 
that "Iraq will not permit (U.S.-born Americans) to depart the country." 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the announcement was "an 
important development" and "news that we welcome." But he added that the United 
States continues to believe that all persons still trapped in Kuwait should be 
allowed to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department refused to provide an official estimate of how many of the 
Americans trapped in Kuwait would be affected by the agreement. But in 
emphasizing its significance, officials noted that many of the American women 
recently evacuated from Kuwait said they were forced to leave Arab husbands 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, there are quite a number of families that fit into that category," 
one ranking State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
In sounding a new warning about the danger of terrorist attacks, Administration 
officials emphasized that the United States had not yet received any warning 
that was both specific and credible -- the grounds for an official alert. 
</P>
<P>
But the State Department said at a midday briefing that the United States is 
"concerned about indications that terrorist groups may be planning operations" 
against U.S. citizens or other targets in response to the American 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Cheney said U.S. 
officials had received "bomb threats, death threats and verbal warnings from 
international terrorist organizations." 
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary noted that terrorism could become a significant weapon in 
the Iraq arsenal. In an apparent warning against a repetition of the 1983 
bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Cheney declared it "imperative 
that we take adequate precautions to protect our interests worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater pledged that the Administration 
would make public any "credible" terrorist threat against an American target. 
</P>
<P>
And in a strongly worded warning, the White House spokesman asserted that "the 
United States would hold Iraq responsible for any act of terrorism undertaken 
by organizations based in Iraq or operating under Iraqi guidance." 
</P>
<P>
On the military front, the Pentagon drew no official conclusions in calling 
attention to the stepped-up activity by Iraqi troops along the Turkish and 
Syrian borders. 
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Pete Williams declined even to specify whether the 
"increased military activity" represents an increase in the number of Iraqi 
forces or simply more aggressive air and ground operations. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a week, the Pentagon had noted no significant changes in Iraqi 
deployments. Tuesday's comments appeared to confirm reports from the region 
that Iraq was assuming a more visible military posture on fronts far from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Asked, however, whether the Iraqi forces have assumed an offensive or defensive 
posture, Williams said only: "We don't detect any sign of imminent hostilities, 
and we'll leave it at that." 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said the separate authorization for live-fire exercises by 
American troops came after weeks of negotiations with Saudi officials concerned 
about the dangers inherent in the use of live ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the Saudi government has now agreed to authorize the firing 
of guns and artillery with calibers of up to 105 millimeters after being 
persuaded that such exercises are essential to keep American troops alert 
during what could be a prolonged stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
The approval does not yet provide authorization for the firing of large 
120-millimeter anti-tank weapons and artillery, for which ground rules are 
still being negotiated, Pentagon officials said. They added that no such 
permission was necessary for the firing of naval guns, which would normally 
occur in international waters.

HOUSE PANEL REJECTS STIFF CURBS ON CONTENT OF ADS FOR CIGARETTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Responding to intense opposition by tobacco and advertising interests, a key 
congressional subcommittee voted Tuesday to kill proposals by anti-smoking 
advocates to impose sweeping new restrictions on cigarette promotional 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
However, the panel approved a measure that would dramatically increase the 
prominence of warning labels on cigarette packages and billboards, ban sales to 
minors nationwide and restrict sales from vending machines and distribution of 
free samples. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents said it appeared unlikely that further action would be taken on 
the bill this year unless Congress reconvenes after the November election. The 
poor prospects reflect a failed behind-the-scenes effort to reach a compromise 
between the $40-billion-a-year tobacco industry and its congressional foes. 
</P>
<P>
After an often-acrimonious debate, the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee 
on health and the environment voted 13 to 9 to quash a proposal to bar the use 
of human or cartoon figures in cigarette advertising. The measure would have 
allowed only "tombstone" ads -- written text with no illustration other than a 
picture of the cigarette brand. 
</P>
<P>
That was the most far-reaching provision of the Tobacco Control and Health 
Protection Act of 1990, a compendium of anti-smoking measures sponsored by Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), the subcommittee chairman. The provisions are 
intended to halt the marketing and sale of cigarettes to young people, 3,000 of 
whom begin smoking each day. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman and his allies maintained that limitations should be imposed on the 
industry's $3-billion annual advertising effort, particularly ads that portray 
smoking as sexy, sophisticated and linked to success. Opponents, led by Rep. 
Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.), said such curbs would be an unconstitutional 
infringement of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry was joined by advertisers, billboard companies and 
newspaper and magazine publishers in lobbying to bury the "tombstone" proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman's entire bill, in fact, was rejected Tuesday in favor of a measure 
introduced by Rep. Bob Whittaker (R-Kan.), another anti-smoking leader, as a 
compromise. In addition to deleting the "tombstone" restriction, Whittaker's 
alternative dropped a proposed ban on tobacco company sponsorship of sporting 
events and public entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The new measure would require that warning labels cover an entire side of a 
cigarette package, double the current size of warnings on billboards, prohibit 
sales from vending machines accessible to minors without adult supervision and 
ban distribution of free samples on streets, sidewalks, public parks or through 
the mail.

COLD-WEATHER CAR POLLUTION CURBS URGED 
</P>

<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency proposed new standards Tuesday to cut 
harmful emissions from automobiles operating in cold weather, saying the rules 
could reduce pollution levels 29% nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Improving a car's cold-weather performance would also reduce pollution levels 
in regions with higher temperatures, such as Southern California, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tightening the regulations for auto makers would affect 40% of all cars and 
trucks in the 1993 model year, increasing to all models by 1995 as the rules 
are phased in, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new carbon monoxide standards would require improvement in engine 
calibrations to reduce unnecessary fuel enrichment, increasing average car 
prices by $19 to $31, officials said. But improved fuel economy resulting from 
more complete engine combustion would more than offset the increased purchase 
cost, they said. 
</P>
<P>
EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said the new regulations not only would 
improve air quality but could save up to 43,000 barrels of oil each day due to 
more efficient fuel consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Because concentrations of carbon monoxide increase significantly at colder 
temperatures, the agency said it planned to require automobile manufacturers to 
further improve engine calibrations so that emissions are greatly reduced in 
winter weather, particularly when cars start up. 
</P>
<P>
The current federal pollution limit, which applies only to automobile 
performance in temperatures of 68 to 86 degrees, is 3.4 grams per mile. 
Beginning in 1993, the EPA wants many new cars to meet a standard of 10 grams 
per mile at a temperature of 20 degrees. The new standard for light trucks 
would range from 12 to 15 grams per mile, depending upon weight. 
</P>
<P>
The cold-weather standards are more liberal than warm-weather rules because 
emissions are harder to control at lower temperatures, officials said. But they 
stressed that the proposed improvements would serve to reduce cold-weather 
emissions by more than one fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Harmful automobile emissions result from incomplete combustion of fuel and are 
particularly high during the first few minutes after a vehicle is started. 
</P>
<P>
EPA tests of recent-model vehicles show that emission levels are below the 
3.4-grams-per-mile standard at a temperature of 75 degrees. But at 20 degrees, 
emissions range up to 35.9 grams per mile. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Bowditch, vice president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn., said 
his organization has been discussing the proposed standards with the EPA for 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
"This is, in fact, a first draft, and there will be more discussions on the 
subject," Bowditch said. "But we're more or less prepared for the regulations. 
The numbers the EPA has proposed will be difficult, but we'll take them in 
stride one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Under its rule-making procedures, the EPA is inviting public comment and will 
hold a hearing on its proposed standards before issuing final rules later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The standards being proposed are based on the levels of control the agency 
believes are technologically feasible and cost-effective in the near term," a 
spokesperson said. "To determine the amount and kind of vehicle control needed 
in the future, the agency is undertaking a long-term study to determine the 
need for further regulation."

MANDELA SEES PEACE PROCESS PERILED; 
</P>
<P>
S. AFRICA: ANC LEADER SAYS THE GOVERNMENT IS UNWILLING TO ACT TO END BLACK 
FACTIONAL VIOLENCE. HE WARNS OF POSSIBLE RETURN TO ARMED STRUGGLE.

<P>
As black factional fighting flared again near Johannesburg, Nelson Mandela met 
President Frederik W. de Klerk on Tuesday and later declared the peace process 
imperiled by government reluctance to move swiftly to end the township carnage. 
</P>
<P>
"It is dragging its feet, (and) the peace process is definitely threatened," 
Mandela told reporters after leading a 22-person African National Congress 
delegation in three-hour talks with De Klerk in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela added that the ANC might be forced by its supporters to consider a 
return to the 29-year-old armed liberation struggle, which it formally 
suspended last month. 
</P>
<P>
"If the government fails to take action, if violence continues to rise and the 
people continue to demand to be armed, we will find it difficult to oppose that 
demand, and, of course, the consequences would be very clear to everybody," 
Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting between factions, which pits mostly migrant Zulu workers from 
Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party against Xhosas and other 
supporters of Mandela's ANC, has thus far claimed nearly 700 lives in townships 
surrounding Johannesburg since late July. 
</P>
<P>
It appears to echo the three-year-old internecine war in the eastern province 
of Natal, Buthelezi's home base. Battles between Zulu followers of Inkatha and 
Zulu followers of the ANC have claimed nearly 4,000 lives in Natal. 
</P>
<P>
Although both Mandela and De Klerk renewed their commitment to the process of a 
peaceful, negotiated end to black oppression on Tuesday, they remained at odds 
over the cause of the violence near Johannesburg and in Natal. 
</P>
<P>
Top-level government officials delivered a rare public criticism of Mandela 
this week, and chief government negotiator Gerrit Viljoen said that the ANC 
"must cease claiming total innocence for themselves and their followers, and 
laying blame on their opponents, or the police." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, the largest and most influential black political group in the country, 
has accused the police of siding with Inkatha, a charge that the police deny. 
Numerous accounts of witnesses to the violence in Johannesburg-area townships 
suggest that some policemen may be assisting Inkatha against the ANC, the 
government's old enemy. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, at least 24 people were hacked, shot or burned to death in battles 
between migrant Zulus and township residents in Katlehong, Vosloorus and Tokoza 
townships southeast of Johannesburg. Police officers and troops under white 
commanders exchanged gunfire with black combatants in the townships, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela has claimed that elements of the police who oppose De Klerk's peace 
initiatives are stoking the black fighting to subvert the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to state very clearly and very emphatically the government has the 
capacity to put an end to this violence if it wants to, and I want them to use 
that capacity," Mandela said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of casualties suffered by our people and the failure of action by 
the government threatens the peace process," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC delegation told De Klerk that it had launched a concerted effort to end 
the violence in Natal, including several short-lived peace agreements with 
Inkatha leaders in some areas. But it said that none of its strategies would 
work unless the government security forces began acting impartially. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC leaders said that the government could end the fighting in Natal only 
if its security forces took over from the self-government Kwazulu homeland's 
police force, which is under the command of Buthelezi. The ANC also recommended 
that police commanders in Natal establish open lines of communication with ANC 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, saying he was deeply concerned about the escalating violence, 
promised to consider the ANC's recommendations. The president added that the 
government already had taken steps to increase police patrols in Natal and 
improve socioeconomic conditions there. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk also said "the growing sense of urgency in the country . . . demands a 
commitment by all representative leaders to peacefully work out the 
constitutional future of the country." The remarks were an apparent reference 
to Mandela's refusal to meet Buthelezi. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela said that the ANC would give De Klerk time to respond to its 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite (the government's) past record of making statements they have not 
carried out, let us give them a chance," he said. But "the government cannot be 
allowed to talk peace and negotiation and at the same time conduct war against 
us."

COUNTY OFFICIALS DRAFT PLAN TO PROTECT OAKS, SYCAMORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County officials have drafted an ordinance that would prohibit most 
property owners from chopping down oak and sycamore trees on patches of rural 
and urban land throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
If the Board of Supervisors adopts the ordinance, Ventura County will become 
one of a handful of counties in the state to have such a regulation, although 
some environmentalists say the proposal is not restrictive enough. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is scheduled to be discussed at a Thursday Planning Commission 
meeting, although final approval is not expected until next month. 
</P>
<P>
County officials decided to pursue an ordinance guarding the oaks and sycamores 
in the rapidly developing areas of the county after receiving letters from 
Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Moorpark and Ojai, which all implemented measures 
to protect the trees. 
</P>
<P>
"It distresses me to the utmost when I can stand on a street in Thousand Oaks 
where the trees are protected, and 10 yards away they're removing trees in the 
county," said Bill Elmendorf, urban forester for Thousand Oaks. "It's a shame 
to take down a tree, especially if you don't have to." 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed ordinance, oak and sycamore trees could be removed if they 
are diseased, in the way of public utilities or a threat to public safety. 
Property owners could also apply for a special permit to remove a tree if they 
can prove that there is no other way to build around it. 
</P>
<P>
Also, property owners would be required to apply for a permit to trim larger 
oak and sycamore trees. 
</P>
<P>
"If we really want to safeguard trees, we have to take certain measures," said 
Todd Collart, manager of the county's zoning administration section. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance would affect 26,000 acres of unincorporated rural and 
urban areas, including Oak Park, Bell Canyon, Ventura River Valley and the 
Santa Susana Knolls near Simi Valley. It does not include open space and 
agricultural land, which total about 470,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Although response to the proposal has been favorable, county planners said, the 
proposed measure has received some criticism from local environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot of trees on the agricultural land and that's fine," said 
John Etter, a Simi Valley environmentalist. "But the ordinance should be 
extended to open space. We want to make the message clear that you don't mess 
around with this. Trees are a resource that should be preserved." 
</P>
<P>
Collart said county planners decided not to include open space and agricultural 
land in the ordinance to avoid a controversy. About eight years ago, officials 
proposed a similar ordinance that included nearly all areas in the county. That 
measure, however, was soundly defeated after farmers and ranchers argued that 
they should be able to do as they please with their land. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sensitive matter," Collart said. "We fully understand people's concerns 
about expanding the ordinance into open space, but we are trying to put 
together a proposal that will succeed. We talked about the history of this 
thing and decided to shrink the ordinance to include urban and rural areas." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Kemper, a member of the Ventura River Valley advisory council, said she is 
concerned that the ordinance will only cause bureaucratic hassles for 
individuals who want to remove a tree so they can build onto their homes.

"It's just one more restriction," Kemper said. "If you want to save trees, you 
have to have rules. But, it seems like we have more and more rules every time 
we turn around." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Keith A. Turner, county planning director, said: "We're proposing 
something people should be doing anyway . . . protecting the large, mature 
trees of the county." 
</P>
<P>
Collart added: "Hopefully, we can get people to stop and think of why they're 
chopping trees down."

JAIL FEE APPROVED OVER CITIES' PROTESTS; 
</P>
<P>
ASSESSMENTS: SUPERVISORS SAY STATE BUDGET CUTS FORCED THE ACTION. MUNICIPAL 
OFFICIALS SAY FEWER SUSPECTS MIGHT BE JAILED, THUS JEOPARDIZING PUBLIC SAFETY.

Despite opposition and pleas for a delay, the County Board of Supervisors 
decided Tuesday to charge cities about $120 every time their police officers 
book someone into Ventura County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
They approved the fee over the objections of city officials who said that they 
couldn't afford it and that they might have to offset the cost by booking fewer 
people into the jail, thus jeopardizing public safety. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors told the city officials who packed the hearing room that they 
had little choice but to impose the fee because state funding cuts had left 
them $5.8 million short. 
</P>
<P>
"The state is the rascal here," Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer said after the 
hearing. Although the state cut funds to counties, the Legislature passed a law 
allowing counties to recoup some of the funds by assessing the booking fees and 
requiring school districts to pay for property tax collection. 
</P>
<P>
The fee, estimated at $120 per person, is expected to generate at least $1 
million a year in Ventura County to cover administrative costs at the jail. 
That would free funds to offset cuts in health, mental health, welfare and 
criminal justice programs. 
</P>
<P>
The city officials asked the supervisors to delay approving the fee until they 
could study its impact further and come up with alternatives. Some learned of 
the fee only days ago. 
</P>
<P>
However, the supervisors approved the fee, which will go into effect Jan. 1 and 
be retroactive to July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to bite the bullet," Schaefer said after it was approved. But the 
approval also included a provision for a task force of city officials to look 
at alternatives to the fee. 
</P>
<P>
That irked some city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The task force was a way to mollify people there," said Santa Paula Police 
Chief Walter H. Adair, who said the time to form such a group is before 
approval of the fee. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that police would book fewer people into the jail concerned 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, who warned supervisors in a letter that it 
might cause an increase in crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned that cities, in an effort to avoid the fee, will be citing 
and releasing a majority, if not all, misdemeanor offenders," he said. "My 
office currently files approximately 2,000 misdemeanor cases a month." 
</P>
<P>
The fee also could add to the workload of the criminal justice agencies, he 
said, if a defendant is cited and released and then fails to appear later in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard would be hit the hardest by the fee. Already financially drained, the 
city might have to pay $550,000 in booking fees. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Robert Owens compared the fee to "charging the doctor for 
hospitalizing the patient." He said police might have to release people under 
the influence of heroin and cocaine rather than book them as they now do. That 
could amount to about 2,500 drug abusers a year who are cited and then 
released, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi asked the supervisors, "Does the fee policy as 
proposed force cities to alter their policies to the point of being detrimental 
to our excellent countywide record regarding public safety and criminal 
activity?" 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Paula, Adair said the fee will cost the city $77,000 to $120,000 a 
year. He said he is contemplating laying off one or two officers to offset the 
cost and possibly cutting the number of offenders taken to the jail. 
</P>
<P>
But the supervisors refused to buy the argument that the fee might jeopardize 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a false argument," Supervisor James R. Dougherty said. "If they choose 
not to book someone, that is their decision. Don't lay it off on the board." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors contend that cities can better afford the cost of booking 
people into the jail than the county can. They point to undesignated reserves 
in the cities' budgets that could be tapped. 
</P>
<P>
But the cities hinted that the booking fees might cause them to think twice 
about helping the county fund the operation of the new jail, which is scheduled 
to be built starting next year. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatives to the booking fees were proposed by city officials and others. 
Steve Blanchard, vice president of the Oxnard Peace Officers Assn., said the 
fee could be collected from defendants after conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Mayor Richard L. Francis said after the hearing that one possibility is 
for the city to book offenders at its own jail, rather than use the county 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it is even legal," he said. "It's something to be explored." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Councilwoman Ann Rock said city and county officials should band 
together and let the state know how they feel about funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it any more," she said. "Let's 
put our heads together and give them hell."

BUILDER, HOPE OFFER RIDES TO HEARING ON ANNEXATION; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE EFFORT IS PART OF AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN TO DRUM UP SUPPORT 
FOR MAKING JORDAN AND RUNKLE RANCHES A PART OF SIMI VALLEY.

<P>
Entertainer Bob Hope and a developer are offering free rides and refreshments 
to Simi Valley residents who attend a meeting in Ventura this morning 
concerning a proposal for the city to annex Hope's Jordan and Runkle ranches. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 cards were sent offering rides to the meeting, along with coffee 
and doughnuts, Fred Maas, vice president of Potomac Investment Associates, said 
Tuesday. The firm has an option to buy the 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch for 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Corina Antonucci, a volunteer at the Jordan Ranch Information Center in Simi 
Valley, which is operated by Hope and Potomac, said she had received 30 to 40 
inquiries about rides by late Tuesday. She said at least one bus had been 
chartered to take people to the 9 a.m. meeting of the Local Agency Formation 
Commission at the Ventura County Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
Maas would not reveal the cost of the gesture by Hope and Potomac. "It's not a 
lot of money," he said. "It's very inexpensive." 
</P>
<P>
The offer to provide rides to the LAFCO meeting is the latest maneuver in an 
aggressive campaign by Hope and the developer to drum up local support for the 
city to annex the entertainer's property. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Hope and Potomac have taken out full-page ads in newspapers 
outlining some of the benefits that the city and the county would reap from the 
annexation. The ads feature a picture of a smiling Hope with an American flag 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hope and the developer have sent about 10,000 letters to residents 
explaining the annexation proposal and asking for support. 
</P>
<P>
Maas said so far that Potomac and Hope have received about 1,500 responses to 
the letters and that about 25 or 30 were from people against annexation. 
</P>
<P>
Maas said Hope and Potomac decided to offer rides to today's LAFCO meeting 
because they have heard that the environmental group Save Open Space, which is 
opposed to development of Jordan Ranch, has hired buses to take people to the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But Mary Wisebrock, head of Save Open Space, said the group had no plans to bus 
people to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the money to hire buses, although we are getting some people to 
car-pool in," said Wisebrock, whose group has taken out ads in newspapers 
opposing the annexation. She said the meeting will not be convenient for many 
of the groups's 250 members because they will be at work. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO is scheduled to meet in the Board of Supervisors hearing room to consider 
Simi Valley's request for an early opinion on the feasibility of expanding the 
city's sphere of influence to include the Hope property. City officials said 
they want to avoid the long and costly process of amending the city's General 
Plan, traditionally required before LAFCO takes action, if it appears that the 
proposal would be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is scheduled to vote on whether to change its procedures for 
hearing such proposals and not on the issue of annexation. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Maas said LAFCO's decision will give Hope and Potomac an idea of what 
the chances are for annexation. 
</P>
<P>
Hope, fearing opposition to his Jordan Ranch development from the County Board 
of Supervisors, turned to Simi Valley in July with the annexation proposal. In 
addition to Jordan Ranch, Hope has asked the city to annex 3,600 acres of his 
Runkle Ranch a few miles northeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Wisebrock said her group is opposed to development of Jordan Ranch south of the 
city because of the increased traffic and smog it would generate in eastern 
Ventura County and because it is tied to a controversial land swap involving 
federal parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Under the land-swap proposal, the National Park Service would exchange 59 acres 
needed for an access road to the Jordan subdivision for 1,100 acres of the 
ranch. In addition, Hope would sell and donate 4,600 acres in the Santa Monica 
and Santa Susana mountains to park agencies for a below-market price of $10 
million.

<P>
A 25-year-old Thousand Oaks man who reportedly tried to drive off in his white 
Porsche with a sheriff's deputy hanging on the window is being held on 
suspicion of assault with a deadlyweapon on a police officer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hans Petersdorf is also accused of resisting arrest, reckless driving, 
evading arrest and driving with a suspended or revoked license, said Ventura 
County Sheriff's Sgt. Bruce Watlington. 
</P>
<P>
Bail has been set at $20,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the driver of a white Porsche 930 Turbo had evaded them for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 27, a deputy clocked the car traveling north on Westlake Boulevard at 
Hillcrest Drive at about 115 m.p.h., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 1, the same deputy saw a Porsche at the intersection of Duesenberg 
Drive and Thousand Oaks Boulevard, but the driver sped off while the deputy 
talked with him, Lt. Richard Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura deputies on Tuesday blocked the Porsche's escape route at Westlake 
Boulevard and Hillcrest Drive with two patrol cars at 11:15 a.m. But as Deputy 
Carl Gruen tried to wrestle the keys from the driver, he tried to drive away, 
Diaz said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

RED CROSS TO HOLD CLASSES FOR WORKERS

<P>
Faced with a shortage of volunteers and ever-present earthquake danger, 
officials of the Ventura chapter of the American Red Cross said they plan to 
hold training seminars later this month aimed at rebuilding a dwindling corps 
of relief workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We can get ahold of food and blankets and cots in a pinch, but we need people 
trained in disaster assistance," said Lenore Gabel, the chapter's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more than 300 trained volunteers, but that wouldn't be nearly enough 
people to handle a catastrophic earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
In major disasters, the Red Cross counts on trained volunteers to administer 
first aid, provide food and shelter, locate trapped survivors and assess 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
With the San Andreas Fault along the northern border of the Ventura Basin and 
other fault lines riddling the Santa Barbara Channel, the county faces the 
possibility of a major earthquake, said Thomas Headon, chief scientist at the 
U.S. Geological Survey's Pasadena office. 
</P>
<P>
Last October's Bay Area earthquake, along with the recent Santa Barbara fire, 
generated dozens of calls to the Red Cross Ventura chapter from people offering 
to lend assistance in the event of a local disaster, said Scott Eaton, a 
volunteer supervisor of food and shelter operations for the Red Cross. But 
virtually all of the prospective volunteers had to be turned away because of a 
lack of training, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We appreciated those offers, but it is very difficult to work effectively with 
untrained personnel during chaotic situations," Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
The training courses are scheduled for Sept. 29 and 30 at Cabrillo Middle 
School in Ventura, Gabel said. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers before had to travel as far away as Los Angeles for such training. 
</P>
<P>
Gabel said the courses will include an overview of disaster relief programs, 
instruction in managing shelter and food operations, doing damage assessments, 
and a basic lifesaving class. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

A smoggy back-to-school heat wave with temperatures topping 100 degrees in the 
San Fernando Valley greeted schoolchildren who returned to classes Tuesday 
while bidding goodby to their last three-month summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in July, all 616 schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District 
will operate year-round to make room for new students. Under the new plan, 
student vacations will be taken throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little nostalgic about it," said Carpenter Avenue School Principal Joan 
Marks, who greeted new students and their parents in the auditorium of the 
Studio City elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in the fast-growing district is expected to total more than 625,000 
this year, district officials said. During the past two years, enrollment in 
the Los Angeles school district, the nation's second largest, has increased by 
about 30,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Valley schools, which make up nearly 30% of the district's total student 
enrollment, reported increases in already crowded primary grades. Final fall 
enrollment numbers will not be ready until next month, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
To make more classroom space available, 37 elementary schools in the Valley are 
operating on year-round schedules, with the remaining 103 elementary, junior 
and senior high schools scheduled to switch in July. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of attending school during the sweltering Valley summers began to 
hit home for teachers and students who have yet to begin the year-round 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 109 degrees in my classroom today," said Linda Minster, an eighth-grade 
American history teacher at William Mulholland Junior High School in Van Nuys. 
"That is cruel and unusual punishment." 
</P>
<P>
At Taft High School in Woodland Hills, Principal Ron Berz said the extreme heat 
drained some of his students' normal enthusiasm, at least during the first week 
of school. 
</P>
<P>
"The students are usually pretty motivated and anxious to get back to school, 
but they were lethargic," Berz said. "This is the hottest first day I can 
remember." 
</P>
<P>
The school board on Monday is scheduled to consider a $35-million plan to 
install low-cost, portable air-conditioning at the hottest 61 year-round 
schools, including 35 in the Valley where classroom temperatures routinely 
exceed 90 degrees during the summer. The plan is contingent upon Sacramento 
agreeing to give Los Angeles most of the $36 million remaining in the state's 
air-conditioning fund, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
To combat the heat this week, principals at Valley schools are being allowed to 
call for shortened days, beginning Wednesday, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials had more on their minds than the heat after a drive-by 
shooting Monday of a 15-year-old student who was leaving the campus of John H. 
Francis Polytechnic High School in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Manuel Yepiz of Sun Valley, remained in stable condition at 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center, Los Angeles police said. Detectives, who 
believe the shooting was gang-related, said no arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
But Principal Virginia Holt said the shooting was upstaged Tuesday by the 
excitement of students getting reacquainted after the summer off and the 
beginning of classes. "We have had a very quiet, peaceful first day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday there were three school police officers on the campus in response to 
the shooting, Holt said. Normally, there is one officer assigned to each 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police also increased patrols by the campus, where officers said 
members of several rival gangs attend school. The additional patrols are a 
routine at the beginning of the school year and were not prompted by the 
shooting Monday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"We put extra patrols out there to kind of set a tone," said Lt. Michael 
Ranshaw, who added that there were no problems Tuesday. "So far, so good," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the heat and fears of violence, many students said they were glad 
to return to school. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good vacation but I missed the teachers and my friends," said Melissa 
Reiss, a third-grader at the Vintage Street Fundamental School in Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
Reiss was one of the few in her class to have one of the Vintage Street 
school's new blue, white and gray uniforms. School officials and parents voted 
in spring to begin a voluntary dress code that calls for students to wear 
uniforms. It is the second Valley school to try the experiment, which is meant 
to discourage the wearing of gang colors and make it easier for parents to 
dress their children. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a very finicky child and this saves screaming fights in the morning 
over what to wear," parent Barbara Friedrich said. "It also gives them a sense 
of pride and belonging."

JUDGE DEALS SETBACK TO WARNER RIDGE FOE; 
</P>
<P>
ZONING: COUNCILWOMAN JOY PICUS SAYS THE DECISION MEANS ANY UNHAPPY DEVELOPER 
CAN GET A COURT TO REVERSE CITY COUNCIL ACTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
In a blow to City Councilwoman Joy Picus' effort to head off a commercial 
complex proposed for Warner Ridge, a Superior Court judge on Tuesday gave Los 
Angeles 30 days to rezone the Woodland Hills property to permit the office 
project to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Judge John R. Zebrowski had given the council the option of 
designating the property for either residential or commercial use. But 
Zebrowski said Tuesday that he had changed his mind because of a recent state 
Supreme Court ruling. He told the council that it must rezone the property for 
commercial development within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The 21.5-acre Warner Ridge property is one of about 15,000 in Los Angeles in 
which the zoning and planning designations are in conflict. The property is 
zoned for single-family houses but the Woodland Hills Community Plan designates 
it for office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
State courts have not clarified whether cities, when faced with such a 
conflict, must change zoning to match planning, planning to match zoning or 
whether they have the flexibility to do either. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Zebrowski had relied on a Riverside County case in giving the city the 
option to change either the plan or the zoning. He also had given the city five 
months to take action. 
</P>
<P>
But since that decision, the judge said Tuesday, the state Supreme Court has 
largely invalidated the ruling he had relied upon. 
</P>
<P>
Picus and other city officials, while admitting that time was short, said they 
will appeal Zebrowski's latest ruling as well as continue with an appeal of his 
July decision. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether to build single-family houses or medium-rise office towers 
on the property, which is on De Soto Avenue between Pierce College and Warner 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Picus won accolades from many Woodland Hills homeowners by 
persuading the council to reject the office complex proposed by Warner Ridge 
Associates and rezone the land for houses. She said office towers would 
inundate surrounding streets with traffic and smog. 
</P>
<P>
At her behest, the council moved to change the community plan designation to 
conform to the new zoning, a process that normally takes six months or more. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Picus said she was "angry, dismayed and shocked that the city's 
planning process can be pushed aside by a judge's whim." 
</P>
<P>
She said that if the Warner Ridge developers "get away with this, any developer 
who doesn't like what the council does can run to court to get it reversed." 
</P>
<P>
But Albert Spound, a partner in the Warner Ridge project, said he was happy 
with the ruling. "We now expect to get our commercial zoning in 30 days and 
then hopefully we can get started on this project." 
</P>
<P>
Spound contends that because the developers bought the land on the assumption 
that offices could be built there, it is unfair and illegal for the city to 
abruptly change the zoning in response to pressure from nearby homeowners. 
Houses would be far less profitable than offices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership says it pays $330,000 a month on loans on the vacant property. 
</P>
<P>
The developers, a partnership of The Spound Co. and Johnson Wax Development 
Co., originally proposed 810,000 square feet of office space. 
</P>
<P>
But Spound said Tuesday that he and his partners "have never been set in 
concrete on this. We have always been willing to talk, but the city has been 
unwilling." 
</P>
<P>
Picus said Tuesday she was "not willing to talk compromise on this. I'm not 
giving up." 
</P>
<P>
She added that if forced to permit commercial development on the site, "it 
certainly will not be the type and magnitude of development originally 
proposed. I will try to put as many restrictions as possible on the land." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gross, president of Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, said he was 
"not at all pessimistic" about Tuesday's ruling "because it doesn't seem to be 
supported by anything." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that eventually the city's right to zone property as it sees fit will 
be upheld on appeal," he said.

ONE TERM IS ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The excellent letter to the editor from Harry Godley, published Aug. 14, 
expresses the increasing frustrations the public feels with our government. The 
situations that Godley cites are symptomatic of the crying need to limit 
government officials to a single short term in office, without the possibility 
of subsequent reelection or reappointment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, lobbying activities by paid lobbyists should be a criminal 
offense, with the same type of penalties that are now applicable to the crime 
of jury tampering. Removing the pressures of peddled influences and of 
reelection or reappointment would permit our government officials to 
concentrate on representing and serving the public. With these simple reforms, 
the costs of all levels of government would be dramatically reduced.

WAYNE REYNOLDS BUNNELL; TELECOMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Reynolds Bunnell, who served as director of telecommunications for 
County-USC Medical Center, has died in Mission Hills. He was 49. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Sylmar, Bunnell died Sunday of pneumonia, said his father, Andrew 
Bunnell. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Burbank, Bunnell was raised in the San Fernando Valley and moved to 
Gorman as a teen-ager. He rode a 120-mile round trip each day on a school bus 
to attend Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, where he graduated in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Bunnell worked as a salesman for California Water and Telephone Co., which 
later became GTE California Inc. He earned an associate of arts degree in 
advanced electronics from a Southern California community college and in 1967, 
he was hired by Los Angeles County to work in the telecommunications 
department. 
</P>
<P>
As director of telecommunications for the hospital, he was active with the 1984 
implementation of the 911 emergency telephone system countywide and traveled 
around the state encouraging other counties to adopt similar programs, said 
Oscar Tandog, assistant director of telecommunications. Bunnell also was 
involved with creating an emergency backup telephone system for County-USC 
Medical Center, Tandog said. 
</P>
<P>
Bunnell was a member of the Elks Lodge No. 1919 in Gardena and a group called 
Clean Campgrounds Always. For the past three years he dressed up as Santa Claus 
and visited patients at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of eight years, Lydia Bunnell; a son, Loren Bunnell 
of San Diego; a daughter, Dana Smith of Porterville; parents, Andrew and Avon 
Bunnell of Lake View Terrace; and a sister, Patricia Suzanne Moat of Kagel 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held Friday at 8 p.m. at St. Didacus Catholic 
Church, 14339 Astoria St. in Sylmar. The Neptune Society in Burbank is handling 
arrangements. Contributions can be made in Bunnell's name to the charity of the 
donor's choice, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles or the Elks Lodge No. 1919 in 
Gardena.

SCHAEFER AND HER CONSTITUENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A message for Madge Schaefer: "Your spitefulness and pettiness are showing." 
</P>
<P>
You apparently do not understand why you really lost your election. 
</P>
<P>
You blame it on "one issue radicals." You are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The real reason you lost is that you spent the past several years not 
representing the people of your district, on this and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
You have done a very good job of representing a few rather than the majority. 
You have represented outside interests rather than those of your own 
constituents. You took over Oak Park's MAC, giving positions on that board to 
the most wealthy in the community, breaking with a long tradition of electing 
members, common human decency and the concept of equal representation. You 
consistently push for big money land development interests, such as David 
Murdoch, Bob Hope and Potomac Investment Associates, a Maryland-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
My neighbors and I did not vote against you because of one issue politics. We 
voted against you because you have refused to represent us as our supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I oppose the changes being proposed to the county general plan that would 
allow big outside interests to destroy my neighborhood. But I did not vote 
against you because of just that one issue. Had you represented my family and 
me better on many other issues, I might have voted for you in spite of this one 
issue, taking it as a fair disagreement. I voted against you because you chose 
to represent the interests of others. If you want to serve outsiders like 
Potomac Investment Associates, then please, Ms. Schaefer, move to Maryland and 
run for election there. 
</P>
<P>
In the final days of your term, just once really represent your constituents 
rather than outside interests.

HOPE, JORDAN RANCH DEVELOPER OFFER FREE RIDES TO ANNEXATION HEARING; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI VALLEY: THE EFFORT IS PART OF AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN TO DRUM UP SUPPORT 
FOR MAKING THE LAND A PART OF THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Entertainer Bob Hope and a developer are offering free rides and refreshments 
to Simi Valley residents who attend a meeting in Ventura this morning 
concerning a proposal for the city to annex Hope's Jordan and Runkle ranches. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 cards were sent offering rides to the meeting, along with coffee 
and doughnuts, Fred Maas, vice president of Potomac Investment Associates, said 
Tuesday. The firm has an option to buy the 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch for 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Corina Antonucci, a volunteer at the Jordan Ranch Information Center in Simi 
Valley, which is operated by Hope and Potomac, said she had received 30 to 40 
inquiries about rides by late Tuesday. She said at least one bus had been 
chartered to take people to the 9 a.m. meeting of the Local Agency Formation 
Commission at the Ventura County Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
Maas would not reveal the cost of the gesture by Hope and Potomac. "It's not a 
lot of money," he said. "It's very inexpensive." 
</P>
<P>
The offer to provide rides to the LAFCO meeting is the latest maneuver in an 
aggressive campaign by Hope and the developer to drum up local support for the 
city to annex the entertainer's property. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Hope and Potomac have taken out full-page ads in newspapers 
outlining some of the benefits that the city and the county would reap from the 
annexation. The ads feature a picture of a smiling Hope with an American flag 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hope and the developer have sent about 10,000 letters to residents 
explaining the annexation proposal and asking for support. 
</P>
<P>
Maas said so far that Potomac and Hope have received about 1,500 responses to 
the letters and that about 25 or 30 were from people against annexation. 
</P>
<P>
Maas said Hope and Potomac decided to offer rides to today's LAFCO meeting 
because they have heard that the environmental group Save Open Space, which is 
opposed to development of Jordan Ranch, has hired buses to take people to the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But Mary Wisebrock, head of Save Open Space, said the group had no plans to bus 
people to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the money to hire buses, although we are getting some people to 
car-pool in," said Wisebrock, whose group has taken out ads in newspapers 
opposing the annexation. She said the meeting will not be convenient for many 
of the groups's 250 members because they will be at work. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO is scheduled to meet in the Board of Supervisors hearing room to consider 
Simi Valley's request for an early opinion on the feasibility of expanding the 
city's sphere of influence to include the Hope property. City officials said 
they want to avoid the long and costly process of amending the city's General 
Plan, traditionally required before LAFCO takes action, if it appears that the 
proposal would be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is scheduled to vote on whether to change its procedures for 
hearing such proposals and not on the issue of annexation. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Maas said LAFCO's decision will give Hope and Potomac an idea of what 
the chances are for annexation. 
</P>
<P>
Hope, fearing opposition to his Jordan Ranch development from the County Board 
of Supervisors, turned to Simi Valley in July with the annexation proposal. In 
addition to Jordan Ranch, Hope has asked the city to annex 3,600 acres of his 
Runkle Ranch a few miles northeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Wisebrock said her group is opposed to development of Jordan Ranch south of the 
city because of the increased traffic and smog it would generate in eastern 
Ventura County and because it is tied to a controversial land swap involving 
federal parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Under the land-swap proposal, the National Park Service would exchange 59 acres 
needed for an access road to the Jordan subdivision for 1,100 acres of the 
ranch. In addition, Hope would sell and donate 4,600 acres in the Santa Monica 
and Santa Susana mountains to park agencies for a below-market price of $10 
million.

CITIZENS PANEL FILLS 9 VACANCIES DESPITE PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A citizens advisory committee for the North Hollywood redevelopment zone filled 
nine vacancies in an election Tuesday that was held despite objections of city 
officials and others about the way the panel chooses members. 
</P>
<P>
The election provided enough members to give the 25-seat committee a quorum, 
which means it can advise the Community Redevelopment Agency on several 
projects, including a proposed Vineland-Magnolia shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
The selections were made in a meeting punctuated by catcalls from audience 
members who wanted all residents and businesses within the 740-acre 
redevelopment area to have the right to vote. Under the committee's bylaws, the 
selections are made by existing members of the committee, which is known as the 
North Hollywood Project Area Committee. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 people attended Tuesday's meeting, including 33 candidates who 
vied for the open positions. Critics contend that the citizens committee is a 
tool of the CRA and business interests. 
</P>
<P>
"They're keeping anyone who criticizes out," said Norton Halper, a Hollywood 
resident and a spokesman for Endangered Citizens of North Hollywood, which is 
critical of the panel's procedures. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood resident Maria Fant, who was elected to the advisory committee 
Tuesday, collected 32 signatures on a petition calling on Los Angeles City 
Councilman John Ferraro to overturn the election. "The whole community should 
be able to vote," Fant said. "The only reason I was elected was the committee 
didn't know my feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Donald R. Spivak, director of operations for CRA, said that allowing only 
committee members to vote is less expensive and much faster than a general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Councilman Richard Alatorre, a member of the council's Community 
Redevelopment and Housing Committee, questioned the validity of the vote, 
saying the North Hollywood group failed to alert potential candidates.

Alatorre's remarks -- Due to an editing error, an article Wednesday incorrectly

to fill vacant seats on the North Hollywood Project Area Committee. Although 
the committee did conduct an election Tuesday, Alatorre's remarks dealt with a 
committee election in February.

GROUP ORGANIZES TO CLEAN UP SEPULVEDA AREA, FIGHT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
About 40 Sepulveda-area homeowners and representatives of businesses, schools 
and community organizations met Tuesday night to discuss ways to clean up the 
community and combat crime. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which gathered for an organizational meeting of the Sepulveda 
Community Coordinating Council, also talked about the need to create 
alternatives for youths who might otherwise become involved in crime. 
</P>
<P>
The council will work under the auspices of the Los Angeles County Federation 
of Community Coordinating Councils, which has organized 58 similar groups, 
including five others in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Many people at Tuesday's meeting expressed frustration with conditions in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a community that has had it up to here," Jeff Smith, owner of Edifice 
Construction Co. on Tupper Street, said as he held his hand next to his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Capt. Jim Whitley said that although crime has decreased 8% 
in the area since 1987 and police patrols have increased, "there are 
limitations on what we can do. You can become the eyes and the ears of the 
Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Phyllis DeObaldia, personnel director of Penny Lane, a halfway house 
for wards of the court, volunteered to co-chair the organization. The group 
agreed to meet in two weeks to begin setting goals. 
</P>
<P>
Community members have said they want to broaden the campaign against drug use 
by establishing programs for area youths that will provide constructive 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to take a more comprehensive approach to this rather than just 
setting up barricades," Arline DeSanctis, chief field deputy for City 
Councilman Joel Wachs, said in an interview earlier Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
DeObaldia said one purpose of the council "is to deal with young people, to 
become involved with them." She said the council will be able to apply for 
grants from Los Angeles County and private foundations to fund its work. 
</P>
<P>
Community councils are formed to deal with a variety of problems, but most have 
made crime a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only the money things, but things that they can do that wouldn't cost 
anybody anything," said Lauraine Barber, executive director of the federation. 
"For example, maybe some retired people can tutor young people." 
</P>
<P>
The Sepulveda council will handle a six-square-mile area -- with about 40,000 
residents -- bounded by Balboa Boulevard, the Pacoima Wash, Lassen Street and 
Roscoe Boulevard.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT / POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: ENTERTAINER MUSIC AWARDS TO 
BE PRESENTED IN ENCINITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The ninth annual Entertainer Music Awards ceremony will be held Monday night at 
the La Paloma theater in Encinitas, honoring this year's winners of the contest 
for San Diego County bands and nightclub performers. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a panel of local club owners, deejays and other industry people 
selected five nominees in each of the 12 categories. Ballots were then printed 
and distributed to various locations around the county, giving the public the 
chance to vote for their favorites. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-day balloting period ended last Sunday. At the awards ceremony, the top 
vote-getter in each category will be announced and presented with a solid 
bronze "Jolson" statuette, cast in the likeness of legendary pop singer Al 
Jolson and designed by former Charger Ed White. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to predict the people's choices is a risky proposition, but here goes: 
</P>
<P>
* Best Contemporary Solo or Duo (nominees are Ray and Lainie Correa, Gary 
Lehman, Bobby Arvon, Billy Fowler, and Fantasy, featuring Elizabeth Webb and 
Don Tennison): Ray and Lainie Correa. They've got great voices, great harmonies 
and a great repertoire of pop oldies and current hits. 
</P>
<P>
* Best Contemporary (nominees are Hut-Sut Ralston, the Bob Long Band, Second to 
None, the Cat-Illacs and B-Natural): The Bob Long Band. Excellent musicians and 
lots of charisma. 
</P>
<P>
* Best Rhythm and Blues (nominees are the Rhumboogies, the Forbidden Pigs, the 
Blonde Bruce Band, the Rick Gazlay Group and the Nightcrawlers): The Blonde 
Bruce Band. A bunch of white guys who play the electric blues with as much 
intensity and as much passion as any black roadhouse band in the Deep South. 
</P>
<P>
* Best Reggae (nominees are Dr. Chico's Island Sounds, the Cardiff Reefers, 
Burning Bridges, Tribal Lunchbox and Limbo Slam): The Cardiff Reefers. Again, a 
bunch of white guys -- surfer dudes, in this case -- who really put their 
hearts and their souls into black music. 
</P>
<P>
* Best Jazz (nominees are Peter Sprague, the Mark Lessman Band, the Easton-West 
Band, Fattburger and Aubrey Faye): Peter Sprague. Years ago, Downbeat magazine 
called him "an awful hot little comer." He's since grown up into one of the 
hottest jazz guitarists around, not just in San Diego, but in the country. 
</P>
<P>
* Best Vintage Jazz (nominees are Tobacco Road, the Dick Braun Orchestra, the 
Chicago 6, the Chicago 15 and the Sue Palmer Trio): Tobacco Road. Their weekday 
afternoon dance concerts at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach are always well 
attended, and they're adept at handling a variety of vintage jazz styles, from 
stride to swing. 
</P>
<P>
* Best Country (nominees are the Savery Brothers, Dakota, Char Carroll and 
Crossover, North 40 and Scary Mary): the Savery Brothers. The longtime house 
band at the Pomerado Club in Poway plays traditional country twang laced with 
elements of Cajun and rhythm and blues. 
</P>
<P>
* Best Vintage Rock (nominees are Dr. Feelgood and the Interns of Love, 
Rockola, the Big Fins, the Redcoats and the Nostalgics): Rockola. They play the 
most faithful renditions of classic rock songs from the 1960s I've ever heard. 
</P>
<P>
* Best Rock 'n' Roll, Top 40 (nominees are Notice to Appear, Big Bang, Flyweil, 
the Siers Brothers and the Heroes): Flyweil. They've been plying the local 
nightclub scene for nearly a decade, and they've amassed quite a sizable 
following. And for a cover band, these guys sure know how to rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
* Best Rock 'n' Roll, Original Music (nominees are the Beat Farmers, the 
Paladins, Usual Suspects, Private Domain and Comanche Moon): the Paladins. This 
trio has released three albums of infectious, foot-stompin' rockabilly, the 
last two on the nationally distributed Alligator Records label, and their local 
shows are almost always sold out. 
</P>
<P>
* Entertainers of the Year (nominees are the Beat Farmers, the Savery Brothers, 
the Paladins, Rockola and Dr. Feelgood and the Interns of Love): the Beat 
Farmers. Anyone who caught their riveting performance at last weekend's 
Michelob Street Scene '90 will know why. 
</P>
<P>
* Entertainer of the Year (nominees are Country Dick Montana of Beat Farmers, 
Char Carroll, Paul Shaffer of Private Domain, Bob Tedde of Rockola and "Bogie" 
of Dr. Chico's Island Sounds): Country Dick Montana. He's the Foster Brooks of 
the local music scene, with a voice even deeper than Johnny Cash's and the 
overwhelming presence of a backwoods preacher. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets to Monday night's Entertainer Music Awards ceremony are $10 (reserved 
VIP seating, $25). All proceeds will go to the Mary Lou Clack Center for 
Handicapped Children, a nonprofit organization in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The best description of what Nick Lowe does is found in the title of his debut 
solo album, 1978's "Pure Pop for Now People." Lowe, who will appear Thursday 
night at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa, writes clever little pop ditties with 
simple, instantly memorable melodies, all sorts of catchy hooks and openly 
sardonic lyrics. He honed his talents in the early 1970s, during a five-year 
stint with British pub-rockers Brinsley Schwarz. The group broke up in 1975 and 
Lowe formed his own band, Rockpile, with rockabilly revivalist Dave Edmunds. 
</P>
<P>
Rockpile was primarily a touring band; in the six years the group was together, 
only one album was released. Still, Lowe frequently set foot in the recording 
studio. He cut a handful of critically acclaimed solo albums (including his 
1979 breakthrough LP, "Labour of Lust," which spawned his only Top 40 hit, 
"Cruel to Be Kind"). He also produced albums by such fellow pop-meisters as 
Elvis Costello and Graham Parker and the Rumour. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Lowe released his first solo album in three years, "Party of 
One." He also produced the debut album by the Katydids, a London pop-rock band 
fronted by expatriate San Diegan Susie Hug. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Boom Crash Opera's Sept. 22 show at Rio's in Loma Portal has been 
canceled. Songwriter-bassist Richard Pleasance was diagnosed as having 
tinnitus, the ringing of the ears that also plagues the Who's Pete Townshend, 
and was told to take the rest of the year off. The Australian dance band has 
canceled all touring plans until a replacement can be found. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Club of Rome, one of San Diego's most talented original-music bands, will 
perform at Saturday's Environmental Awareness Fair on Moonlight Beach in 
Encinitas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale Saturday at 10 a.m. for Billy Joel's Nov. 7 concert at the 
San Diego Sports Arena, this time at all TicketMaster outlets, even May 
Company. On Monday at 10 a.m. tickets for Santana's Oct. 11 show at Starlight 
Bowl in Balboa Park will be available. . . . Look for a late November or early 
December appearance by veteran heavy metal band AC/DC at the San Diego Sports 
Arena. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Nick Lowe, Thursday at the Bacchanal in 
Kearny Mesa; Screamin' Jay Hawkins with the Subdudes, Thursday at the Belly Up 
Tavern in Solana Beach; Anson Funderburgh and the Rockets with the Forbidden

LOS ANGELES RAISES PARKING FEES, BUSINESS TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Business tax is going to be 10% of gross receipts. That is a big number! 
</P>
<P>
What is also "gross" is that the same package includes ". . . a doubling of a 
special levy that pays for trash trucks." 
</P>
<P>
New trash trucks with hydraulic arms are going to be bought to replace all of 
the present trucks under a new law that mandates use of 60-gallon trash 
containers. That must be more than a million containers that must also be 
purchased! 
</P>
<P>
Present trash collection is quite satisfactory, thank you. Why spend all this 
extra money on new trucks and back-breaking containers? How about spending it 
on more needy causes or, golly, a smaller tax increase?

MELVIN DURSLAG: THERE MUST BE A LESSON HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you will pardon the lack of euphoria in this hour of Los Angeles' triumph, 
we should like to interject the sobering thought that most problems connected 
with the football Raiders have developed after they have signed the papers. 
</P>
<P>
They signed papers three years back to remain in Los Angeles, where the stadium 
would be renovated. 
</P>
<P>
They signed papers to play in Irwindale, where a stadium would be constructed. 
</P>
<P>
And they signed papers to return to Oakland, where the guarantee was made that 
the stadium would be full. It was guaranteed, in fact, for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
In all of the foregoing cases, a done deal turned out to be a deal 
distressingly undone. 
</P>
<P>
So each time the Raiders become involved in a transaction, you are asked to 
recall the words of a distinguished American who reminded us: 
</P>
<P>
"It ain't over till it's over." 
</P>
<P>
At this moment, the Raiders have agreed to play in Los Angeles at a new 
Coliseum built from the shell of the old Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The tab for this remodeling will be fingered mostly by Spectacor, the 
management firm now operating the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Spectacor was enlisted to manage the Coliseum when, over a period of 45 years, 
the Coliseum made it clear it couldn't manage itself. 
</P>
<P>
So the three amigos -- Al Davis, Spectacor and the Coliseum -- enter into a 
deal, a nice, tidy deal, free of complications except for permits that must be 
delivered, environmental reports that must be favorable and blessings from 
preservationists who must be satisfied that not a stone is flawed in the 
precious structure said to embody "the glory that was Rome with the grandeur 
that was Greece." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Los Angeles, a principal in the negotiations, is charged with the 
responsibility of chilling all beefs. 
</P>
<P>
If he succeeds, and the project goes forward as planned, the Raiders, USC and 
all those who follow them will have benefited from a spit-and-polish facility 
long overdue in a village the size of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It would have luxury suites, that monument to football elitists, who nibble 
from the buffet while blood is spilling below. 
</P>
<P>
It would have club boxes. Translation: seats in the stands costing more than 
they should. 
</P>
<P>
And the peasantry would occupy what's left, assuring, as the blueprint is 
drawn, sellouts for every game of both tenants. 
</P>
<P>
USC is a far bigger player in the deal than many suspect. It is the senior 
occupant of the stadium. A football giant, it has cursed its lot for years, 
looking at automatic sellouts at Notre Dame, Ohio State, Michigan, Nebraska and 
the like, all encamped in fine stadiums, while USC romps about in something 
dated. 
</P>
<P>
Consigned to a similar structure in Pasadena, UCLA would find itself well 
behind its cross-city neighbor if USC were able to offer luxury suites to its 
big-time donors and modern, comfortable seating to others. 
</P>
<P>
Picturing the disparity that would develop, Spectacor always envisioned a 
return to its acreage by UCLA, a spokesman once explaining: "The Bruins 
couldn't afford to let the Trojans sneak that far ahead of them." 
</P>
<P>
If the deal works at the Coliseum -- and you had better believe the 
obstructionists haven't yet begun to fight -- it will be interesting to see if 
fans who abandoned the Raiders will forgive them and return to the nest. 
</P>
<P>
If one has a political grievance in this town, one takes it to the lawn of the 
Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
But football fans express their grievances by staying home, as the Raiders 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing earlier that they were moving to Oakland, they found season-ticket 
sales in L.A. plunging to 22,000, lowest in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds this year were embarrassing for exhibition games, but picked up 
surprisingly for the home opener with Denver last Sunday, when the Raiders drew 
54,000. 
</P>
<P>
Will the old fans, many of whom gave up their season seats, find it in their 
hearts to forgive? 
</P>
<P>
A good bet would be that if the Raiders recapture their dignity on the field, 
they will have, in a new stadium, no trouble unloading the 65,000 spaces they 
figure to have. 
</P>
<P>
Now, you might ask, how do folks feel in the Bay Area, having lost -- at least 
on paper -- the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you ask the San Francisco 49ers how they feel and they will tell you they 
never felt better. They want the Raiders in Oakland as they want Joe Montana in 
Vladivostok. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders always upstaged the 49ers when the two shared those precincts. 
Today, it is a tossup whether the 49ers or the Oakland Athletics want the 
Raiders back the least. 
</P>
<P>
The A's own the community in Oakland, not at all concerned with the plight of 
old Raider fans eager to see their beloved outlaws return to the local stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that yet happens depends, as pointed out above, on permits, on 
environmentalists and on preservationists who are next to be heard from in this 
continuing scenario. 
</P>
<P>
If you are trying to prove the folly of man, review the following: 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum has the Raiders locked up, lets them escape to Irwindale, where 
the deal fails. The Raiders then use Sacramento as the wedge to get a deal from 
Oakland, where that deal fails. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to make a new deal in Los Angeles, the Raiders are rejected. They get a 
second deal from Oakland, whereupon Los Angeles then comes up with a deal, 
keeping the team where it wanted to be in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
All this time, energy and expenditure into the toilet -- and everyone is back 
where he started.

RAIDERS: IT'S AS IF THEY NEVER LEFT; 
</P>
<P>
MOVES: ONCE AGAIN, THE INERTIA OF EIGHT YEARS IN LOS ANGELES OVERCOMES DAVIS' 
IMPETUS TO RELOCATE.

<P>
To those cities and politicians who have wheeled and dealed, dreamed and 
schemed, comes this latest bulletin: Owner Al Davis signed a contract Tuesday 
to keep the Raiders in Los Angeles, ending a three-year bidding war that has 
come full circle and left in its wake the ruination of careers, dreams and -- 
in the case of Irwindale -- just plain ruins. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier Hermosillo, come on out of that Irwindale gravel pit. You'll always have 
the summer of 1987, when you landed the deal to bring the Raiders to your cozy 
little town by the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson, sorry that fourth term is doomed. Just remember 
how big you were for those few moments in March, when the prodigal Al Davis 
agreed to come home. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Sacramento, one year ago you were really looking smart. You still are. And 
so was that $50 million you offered those Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, to Tom never-give-up-hope Bradley: Was Tuesday as sweet as Jan. 18, 
1980, when it was disclosed that the Raiders would replace the Rams at the 
Coliseum? 
</P>
<P>
Davis and Spectacor Management Group, the private firm that manages the Los 
Angeles Coliseum, agreed Monday to a 20-year lease in exchange for a privately 
financed, $145-million renovation of the Coliseum. This includes stadium 
improvements the Raiders claimed they were promised when they moved here from 
Oakland in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is said the Raiders will receive $32 million in advance cash 
payments from Spectacor and forgiveness of a $10-million debt the team owes the 
Coliseum Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But with all the fanfare, there is still a catch: The contract could be void in 
a few years if Spectacor does not produce an environmental impact report 
allowing the multimillion dollar renovation of the Coliseum and raise the 
private financing to ,pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to renovate the 67-year-old Coliseum call for retention of the historic 
existing exterior walls. The interior, however, will be drastically altered to 
include the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A reduction in stadium capacity from 92,500 seats to 70,000 for Raider 
games and 85,000 for USC games. Davis said Tuesday he actually wants only 
65,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Construction of as many as 250 luxury boxes at mid-level of the stadium and 
15,000 club seats. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental impact report is expected to take a year. Reconstruction 
would begin after the 1991 Raider and USC seasons. During the 1992 season, both 
USC and the Raiders will have to play elsewhere. Speculation is the Raiders 
will play at Dodger Stadium and USC at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The longstanding dispute between the Raiders and the Coliseum was resolved last 
week when the commission, which no longer runs the facility, voted to drop its 
$58-million breach of contract suit against the Raiders if the team signed an 
agreement to stay. 
</P>
<P>
That suit was filed after the Raiders announced in August of 1987 that they 
intended to move to Irwindale, where officials offered to build a stadium in a 
gravel pit. But the controversy created by Davis and his team started much 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Here's Davis and his Raiders recording history in The Times headlines: 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders Defy League, Court, Head for L.A. (March 2, 1980) -- Not yet. The City 
of Oakland claimed eminent domain and the state Supreme Court sent the trial to 
Superior Court. A court order blocked the Raider move, and the team played in 
Oakland through the 1981 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozelle Antitrust Theory: From Here to Antiquity (Aug. 19, 1982) -- A federal 
court jury in May issued a $49-million judgment in antitrust damages against 
the NFL. The Raiders moved to Los Angeles that fall. 
</P>
<P>
Raiders' Fans Are Screaming: They Are Upset by Poor Seats, Missing Tickets, 
Gouging (Aug. 27, 1982) -- Even before the first game, fans were on Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders Feel at Home in L.A. and Win, 24-3 (Aug. 30, 1982) -- 40,906 fans 
showed up Aug. 29, 1982 for the Raiders' first home game, an exhibition victory 
over the Green Bay Packers. After the game, Lyle Alzado said: "I thought it 
(the fans' reception) was good. It's L.A. Either you like it and understand it, 
or you don't. I like the L.A. people. They're crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders to Be Paid $4 Million: Coliseum Board Sees 'Moral Obligation' to Al 
Davis (Feb. 2, 1984) -- Even though the Raiders won the Super Bowl in January, 
at least one county official was prophetic about giving Davis $4 million before 
he signed a final contract: "This could mean that Davis could move the Raiders 
tomorrow, take the $4 million and pay no penalty," said Donavan Main, then the 
principal deputy county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
It's Official: Davis Signs Contract to Keep Raiders in L.A. (Dec. 9, 1984) -- 
Davis committed the Raiders to the Coliseum through 1991, with options through 
2006. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders to Install Long-Awaited Luxury Boxes in Coliseum (Aug. 21, 1986) -- 
Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
Seating Ruckus Clouds Coliseum Future; Dispute Over Boxes Reconfiguration May 
Bring a Raiders Move (Mar. 22, 1987) -- Davis said he would not build luxury 
boxes unless the Coliseum Commission agrees to an $8 million to $15 million 
reconfiguration of regular seating. The Commission president refused Davis' 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
Raiders Explore Carson, Rose Bowl Options (May 30, 1987) -- The Carson City 
Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
Raiders Sign Pact to Build Stadium on Irwindale Site (Aug. 21, 1987) -- Here's 
where Xavier Hermosillo, the flamboyant official spokesman for Irwindale, 
became famous. Here's why the Coliseum Commission filed a $57-million suit 
against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 They're Singing: You Had It Coming To Ya: Raider Move (to Irwindale) has 
Oakland Smiling (Aug. 28, 1987) -- This tune will also change. 
</P>
<P>
One of Irwindale's Negotiators in Raiders Deal Gives Up Role (May 24, 1988) -- 
Hermosillo said adios, and later, so did the Raiders, when Irwindale ran into 
legal, financial and environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland/Sacramento story: Oakland Dreams of a Return (April 2, 1989). 
$50-million for Raiders Okd by Sacramento -- Inducement for Move Approved 
Unanimously (Sept. 14, 1989). Davis Approves a Return to Oakland by Raiders in 
'92 (March 13, 1990). Oakland Moves to Kill Deal With Raiders (April 18, 1990). 
Oakland Extends Deadline for Relocation Decision by Raiders -- Negotiations in 
L.A. Are Apparently Making Little Progress (Aug. 31, 1990). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile: Oakland Mayor Falls Victim to Raiders Deal (June 7, 1990); and 
Bradley Holds Out Hope That the Raiders Will Stay (March 14, 1990). 
</P>
<P>
One last gasp: C'Mon Al, Just Give Us A Little Hint (Sept. 9, 1990).

NEWSWIRE: TV EXECUTIVE 1ST BLACK MEMBER AT AUGUSTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Townsend, president of Gannett Television Group, has become the first black 
applicant accepted for membership in the prestigious Augusta National Golf 
Club, the golf club confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
An announcement from Gannett said Townsend has direct responsibility for six of 
the company's television stations. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend, 48, was director of field services for the Children's Television 
Workshop and was involved in the children's programs, "Sesame Street" and 
"Electric Company." He became station manager of WTOP-TV in Washington in 1978 
and held that job until being named to his present post in May, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this summer, there was a great deal of controversy over the 
exclusionary membership policies of Shoal Creek Country Club, the site of last 
month's PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
The club admitted a black member after the outcry. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights leaders in Georgia had announced plans to protest next spring's 
Masters if Augusta National, all-white since its founding by golfer Bobby Jones 
in 1932, was not integrated.

FISHING: THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF MARLIN MAKES THEM A BIG FAVORITE WITH ANGLERS

After long hours on an open sea, the wind in his face and a chill in his bones, 
Bob King had had enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll cover this area, then try the Avalon Bank and then the 14-mile bank," he 
said of a course that would eventually lead back to the mainland. "Then we'll 
go back to Newport." 
</P>
<P>
The day was not yet over, but those aboard the 47-foot Davis sportfisher, even 
though warm and snug in the cabin below, would not argue with King's plan to 
return early. They, too, had grown tired of scouring a sea whipped by an 
unseasonably cold wind. 
</P>
<P>
"This is summer!" one of the fishermen uttered in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
The search for marlin had been fruitless, not only for King and his group, but 
for most teams competing in the West Coast Marlin Shootout, a yearly 
competition that at this point was mostly droning on to the tune of diesel 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what they say about marlin fishing, don't you?" King asked. "Hours 
and hours of boredom, punctuated by a few moments of sheer panic." 
</P>
<P>
King, 61, said that isn't always the case. Sometimes the panic comes sooner. 
Otherwise, the Newport Beach yacht-broker wouldn't have stuck with the sport 
for the past 35 years, during which he has caught 100 marlin. 
</P>
<P>
But prospects on this day were dim. There were no birds feeding and few signs 
of life in the water -- no marlin tailing downswell, no feeders feeding. 
</P>
<P>
King had turned the yacht toward the mainland, away from the area known as "the 
slide," a barren slope rising steep and high on Catalina's east end, and was 
nearing the Avalon Bank, a popular spot outside Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the clouds parted and gave way to brilliant sunshine. The ocean 
flattened and turned a deep blue. Sunlight spilled glittering gold across the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
The VHF radio, mostly silent to this point, came alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a hookup," a voice said, giving the angler's name, time of day and 
location. 
</P>
<P>
The slide was suddenly a hub of activity. Another hookup was reported, then 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"So much for my plan," King said, turning the sportfisher about. "I guess we're 
going to stick it out, after all." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the boat was close to the slide, there were at least 30 others 
trolling the waters nearby, and more on the way. Two other tournaments were 
also in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Gulls and terns were searching frantically for bait fish, which, when 
frightened by predators, flutter across the surface in a collective panic. 
</P>
<P>
One marlin jumped and splashed down just off the port bow of the sportfisher, 
but attempts to lure it were futile. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean had come alive, but time had run out, too. 
</P>
<P>
It was 4:30 p.m., and Wanda Kipper, tournament chairwoman, ordered all lines 
in. Fishing would resume the next day, which turned out to be much the same as 
the first. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen marlin were caught and released during the two-day event, which raised 
$15,000 for the American Cancer Society. Fishermen aboard Pacifica Yachts of 
Costa Mesa won with six marlin worth 900 points, points being awarded according 
to the length of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Striped marlin are found throughout the Pacific, from Southern California to 
the Hawaiian Islands and seas of Japan, in the South and Indo-Pacific oceans, 
as well as the Indian Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
They generally make their way up the Baja coast and into local waters -- in 
blue water around the Channel Islands, offshore banks and high spots -- in late 
summer and stay through much of fall. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, the sport has a tremendous history, dating back to Aug. 
28, 1903, when Edward Llewellyn of Los Angeles caught the first marlin on rod 
and reel -- a 125-pound fish he and his colleagues called a marlin spikefish. 
</P>
<P>
Llewellyn was a member of the then-fledgling Avalon Tuna Club, members of which 
were after the giant blue-fin tuna that were common in the waters around the 
Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Another was taken in 1905, and another in 1908. There were nine caught in 1909, 
the largest a 339-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
"Then they caught on," said Charlie Davis, an author-fisherman who caught his 
first marlin in the 1940s. Tuna Club members caught 100 marlin in 1912 and the 
count grew to 223 in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
The legendary Zane Grey, author, outdoorsman and Tuna Club member, used to fish 
local waters extensively in search of large game fish -- and he found plenty of 
marlin and swordfish. 
</P>
<P>
By 1937, Grey held 10 all-tackle world records, one of them being the first 
1,000-pound marlin caught on rod and reel, although that one was not taken in 
local waters. He was said to have hooked more than 100 swordfish in one year, 
many of those around the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
In 1925, he wrote of an unsuccessful 12-hour battle with a swordfish that he 
estimated to have exceeded 1,000 pounds. The giant broadbill, 11 1/2 hours into 
the fight, surfaced during the night to feed on a school of flying fish, 
seemingly unaware that it had even been hooked. 
</P>
<P>
Zane's son, Loren, said he and his father once caught and released 12 marlin in 
one day near San Clemente Island. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Pigg, a Tuna Club member for more than 40 years, said that he used to see 
schools of more than 100 marlin in the waters off Santa Barbara Island. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, Ruth De Lamar of the Balboa Angling Club, caught a 329-pound striper 
that, for a while, stood as a world record. In 1956, Ardelle Chambers of Chula 
Vista caught a 276 1/2-pound striper 14 miles off the Coronado Islands, just 
south of the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Big game was providing big thrills just off the Southern California coast -- 
and it still is. 
</P>
<P>
The prestigious Balboa Angling Club and Avalon weigh station reported historic 
highs last season. BAC members weighed 158 marlin and the club recorded 549 
more that were either tagged and released or just released. Rosie Cadman at 
Avalon reported 393 other stripers. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, they were in droves right out in front of Avalon, right on the 
Avalon Bank for a long time," Davis said. "We were catching fish while dodging 
the buoys they have for shrimp traps out there." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Kogler of Costa Mesa caught 38 stripers aboard his 25-foot boat last 
season and said one of the reasons people are catching more fish is that more 
people are fishing for them, especially aboard smaller -- and cheaper -- boats. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the normal people I know can't afford big boats," Kogler said. "We 
fish them in what we can and the small boats -- they're faster to the feeders 
(marlin feeding on the surface), they're cheaper to run. . . . Your average 
working man can afford to buy one. The maintenance, the running (costs), 
everything's cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
A large yacht can burn 500 gallons of fuel in just a few days. 
</P>
<P>
"We only burn a couple of gallons an hour when we're trolling," Kogler said. 
"So it's affordable for us." 
</P>
<P>
Kogler, 35, won awards from the Balboa Angling Club last season for the first 
marlin of the season -- caught July 14 -- and the last, taken Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"We ended up baiting a fish Dec. 26, which was the latest I've ever seen one, 
but he didn't bite," Kogler added. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Woodard of Huntington Harbour has been fishing for marlin locally for the 
last 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was probably the best year off the coast that we've had," he said. 
"We caught 14 fish last year." 
</P>
<P>
His heaviest weighed 232 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
After a slow start, this season appears to be picking up as well. 
</P>
<P>
Just last Sunday, skipper Steve Von Seggern, 26, and the two anglers aboard the 
Billfish, a 54-foot Bertram, experienced a double hookup while fishing the 
Osborne Bank near Santa Barbara Island. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought they were both sharks because they didn't act like marlin at all," 
Von Seggern said. "They didn't do anything for a long time and then finally one 
of them jumped and we knew what it was." 
</P>
<P>
Both fish took off in the same direction, but one suddenly turned and went the 
opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
"We stuck with it as long as we could until we got almost spooled on both of 
the rods," Von Seggern said. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to tie one of the boat fenders -- also called bumpers, which float 
-- to one of the rods and throw it overboard, then chase down the other fish. 
</P>
<P>
"And it just took off at, like 15 knots, sliding across the water just like in 
Jaws," Von Seggern said of the fendered rod. 
</P>
<P>
Angler Pat Tooley then put the boat's skiff into the water and took off after 
his fish, which was pulling the fender, while Von Seggern maneuvered the boat 
as Dan Wlasiuk fought his fish from its bow. 
</P>
<P>
After 40 minutes, Wlasiuk brought his marlin to the surface, Von Seggern 
released it and the two noticed Tooley being towed to sea. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw this speck on the horizon and hoped it was Tooley," Von Seggern said. 
</P>
<P>
Von Seggern caught up to the skiff and there was Tooley, who had already pulled 
the rod up from beneath the fender and was trying to fight his marlin. But the 
reel's drag, ruined by the saltwater, wasn't working properly. 
</P>
<P>
After jumping back onto the sportfisher, Tooley and Wlasiuk cut the line on the 
first rod and spliced another rod onto it while Von Seggern was backing down on 
the fish with the boat. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent another 20 minutes on that one and finally got it, and released that 
one also," Von Seggern said. "By that time we could barely see the skiff 
again." 
</P>
<P>
They picked up the skiff, then caught and released two more marlin. 
</P>
<P>
Said Davis: "You better have a good boat-handler behind you. There have been a 
number of times when marlin have jumped in the boat, and this is not a nice 
thing to have happen. 
</P>
<P>
"They get jumping around in circles, sometimes they go crazy when they're 
hooked. They do all kinds of wild and crazy stuff. I think that's one of the 
things that makes them such an exciting fish -- you just never know what 
they're going to do."

Don Mattingly, sidelined since July 25 because of a stiff lower back, was 
activated by the New York Yankees Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly is hitting .245 this season in 343 at-bats with five home runs and 35 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
He has not hit a home run since May 20. Mattingly's last appearance was July 24 
at Texas. He was placed on the 21-day disabled list the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sure I would be back -- that was never a question," Mattingly said 
before Tuesday night's game against the Rangers. "In fact, I thought I would be 
back before this, but it took more time than I expected to come around. "I have 
no goals. I'm not looking to do anything offensively or defensively very 
special. All I want to do is play and stay healthy and not experience any more 
pain." 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly did not play in the Yankees' 5-4 victory Tuesday.

LOS ALAMITOS; 
</P>
<P>
FRENCH CANADIAN DRIVERS HAVE A POWERFUL PAIR IN NOTHING VENTURED AND CAPITAL 
GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SCHUELEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two trotting half-brothers have helped to form the French Connection, Los 
Alamitos style. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing Ventured, a 4-year-old horse, has proved to be plenty gained for 
trainer-driver Nicol Tremblay. 
</P>
<P>
Capital Game, his 3-year-old half-brother, has been a huge capital gain for 
driver and co-owner Gaetan Brunet. Tremblay and Brunet are both French 
Canadians from Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing Ventured has won his last eight starts in invitational and free-for-all 
company, and had a career-best time of 1:57 2/5 at Sacramento. He will be 
trying to extend his streak in a $20,000 free-for-all feature next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Capital Game has dominated the 3-year-old trotting division in California. He 
has won three of his last four outings, the only setback coming when he 
ventured into the free-for-all ranks and finished second to Nothing Ventured at 
Sacramento. He ranks as a short-priced favorite in the second race Thursday, a 
$6,000 trot. 
</P>
<P>
Tremblay and Brunet are unrelated and did not meet until the former moved to 
California in 1980. "A friend of mine said, 'Hey, I've got somebody I want you 
to meet who can't speak English,' " Brunet said with a smile, remembering the 
introduction. 
</P>
<P>
Brunet, 38, came to the United States as a teen-ager from Ottawa. Tremblay, 48, 
learned the sport a tougher way, competing on the harsh winter circuits of 
Canada and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Tremblay acquired Nothing Ventured for owner Gratien Deschenes of Quebec in a 
three-horse package as an unraced 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Tremblay describes Nothing Ventured as an ideal physical specimen but not very 
smart. "He's a bad-tempered horse and wants to kill himself all the time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we put him on the van in Sacramento, he cut himself, and we had to 
tranquilize him. He's just a dummy; he doesn't know where the mile starts or 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's a good horse. he's got a lot of ability and he never breaks. He's not 
fussy, and he races without Lasix. The only thing he doesn't like is mud." 
</P>
<P>
Brunet purchased Capital Game for $600 at a Pomona yearling sale. "I had $2,000 
to spend for yearling capital," Brunet said. "I took him back East in March of 
his 2-year-old year and he got real sick and almost died. They held up the van 
for 48 hours in Amarillo, and I was real lucky that we found a good vet there 
who treated him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a horse not made, he was born. When I was at Vernon Downs (in New York) 
that summer training him, Howard Beissinger, Clint Galbraith and Team Nordin 
all said, 'Who is this colt?' 
</P>
<P>
"He qualified at Vernon last September in 2:04, the last quarter in :30, and I 
called Jack Sherren, my father-in-law, in California. He said the last Sire 
Stakes race just went in 2:05, and I headed back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny. At this time last year, the mare (Initial Investment) was nothing, 
and now she's a prolific broodmare." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Nothing Ventured and Capital Game, Initial Investment is also 
the dam of Final Investment, an 8-year-old who won in 2:00 4/5 trotting this 
summer at Vernon Downs. 
</P>
<P>
J. Paul Reddam, a mortgage banker in Sunset Beach, knows timing is everything. 
He was happy to see Riviera Hanover win the first $35,000 leg of the American 
Pacing Classic in 1:55 Saturday but considers the likelihood of a repeat 
performance this Saturday remote. "If we were going to get the money, this was 
the time," said Reddam, who co-owns the 6-year-old gelding in partnership with 
Maryann Plano, wife of trainer Rick Plano. "Next week, we're facing a different 
class of horse." 
</P>
<P>
T K's Skipper, the best older pacer in the nation, will join the series 
Saturday. "He'll be there (today) and race Saturday," trainer Nick Sodano said 
from New Jersey. The 5-year-old horse was originally scheduled to arrive last 
week, but a flight cancellation forced Sodano to transport him from Du Quoin, 
Ill., to Lexington, Ky., to train. T K's Skipper, who had a 1:49 2/5 time trial 
Sept. 1 at Du Quoin, will arrive on a Tex Sutton charter flight with a load of 
thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
Reddam and Plano enjoyed their moment in the sun. "I've owned horses for 10 
years, and this is the best one," Reddam said. "We claimed him for $50,000 last 
December, and now he's won $57,000. We're 'out' and he's getting better. We had 
all the best of it. Dare You To (the favorite, who finished third) had a real 
tough trip and had been off for three weeks. Making the top was the key. He's 
won seven times for us and never lost when he's on the lead." 
</P>
<P>
Harness Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Driver Gene Vallandingham was suspended for 10 days through next Tuesday by Los 
Alamitos stewards for "careless driving which resulted in disqualification and 
an accident" in the invitational pace Sept. 1. Vallandingham, driving Riviera 
Hanover, veered out in the stretch and interfered with Power and Glory, who 
broke stride and fell after the finish. Jim Todd, Power and Glory's driver, who 
went after Vallandingham on the track, was fined $200 by the stewards for 
"unprofessional conduct upon the conclusion of the race." 
</P>
<P>
Driver Bob Sleeth will return Thursday after a 10-day suspension. He failed to 
pass a test for alcohol Aug. 30. Stewards placed Sleeth on probation for the 
remainder of the year. . . . A filly by Denali out of the Rowdy Yankee mare, 
Positively Rowdy, topped the Pacesetter yearling sale at Los Alamitos Sunday. 
Rick Plano paid $29,500 for the unnamed filly. A total of 55 yearlings were 
sold for $319,725, an average of $5,813, up from the average price of $4,400 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Wrenn, who came from Detroit to drive Dare You To Saturday, said he would 
continue coming west on weekends before returning full time for the winter in 
three weeks. Wrenn, 27, scored his 2,000th career victory during the summer in 
Detroit. He finished third in the driver standings at his first Los Alamitos 
meeting last winter. . . . Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager of Los 
Alamitos, said a consortium of 14 Nevada sports books will be able to start 
handling Los Alamitos wagering Sept. 27.

VAN DE KAMP'S FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY UNDER CHAPTER 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 75 years of serving up goodies to generations of Southern Californians, 
Van de Kamp's Holland Dutch Bakers has filed for bankruptcy law protection. 
</P>
<P>
The privately held company continues to operate out of its landmark Dutch-style 
bakery uilding in Glassell Park, northeast of downtown Los Angeles, but has 
laid off more than 100 employees and owes back pay to many that remain, union 
representatives said Tuesday. Company officials are asking the unions to make 
concessions to keep the firm going. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing was brought about by several factors, including slow 
summer sales, high labor costs and some extraordinary losses last year because 
the change to a new computer system disrupted deliveries, said David A. Gill, 
bankruptcy lawyer for Van de Kamp's. 
</P>
<P>
Calls to Van de Kamp's President Robert Schott and its owner, Simon S. David, 
were not returned Tuesday. David also owns a Carson-based real estate firm 
called Interstate Consolidated Industries. 
</P>
<P>
The baking company's unions had another explanation for Van de Kamp's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been run into the ground by the present management," said Bill Walton, 
president of Bakery, Confectionary &amp; Tobacco Workers Union Local 37, which 
represents most of the unionized employees. "It's a sad story because Van de 
Kamp's is a good company and a good name." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Young, an attorney for the Teamsters union, which represents another 60 
employees at the company, said, "There's no doubt that, if the current 
management stays in, the company will be out of business maybe in a matter of 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Gill said management has projected that it has enough money to continue 
operating the company. Despite the unions' harsh words, "Our principal secured 
creditors and the unions are being most cooperative in keeping the company 
alive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition filed Aug. 31, Van de Kamp's listed assets 
of $15.03 million and liabilities of $42.7 million. Under Chapter 11, a company 
continues to do business but is protected from its creditors while it works out 
a plan to pay its debts. 
</P>
<P>
The company's largest creditors are Security Pacific National Bank, which is 
owed about $5.5 million, and the Internal Revenue Service, which is owed about 
$2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's laid off about 125 of its nearly 500 employees late last month, 
just before the bankruptcy petition was filed, Walton said. About 140 employees 
are owed two weeks pay, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gill said Van de Kamp's is meeting its current payroll, and U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court Judge Robin L. Riblet has given the company authority to pay some of what 
it owes employees. When a company is operating under Chapter 11, the court must 
approve all major expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
The company is seeking temporary relief from its collective bargaining 
agreements, including suspending contributions to the employees' medical and 
dental plans and eliminating vacation pay and sick leave pay, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Riblet has given the company and the unions until Friday to negotiate some sort 
of settlement. Riblet has indicated that she will grant a 30-day suspension of 
the contracts if no other agreement is reached, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the employees are very discouraged and very angry," said Young, the 
Teamsters' attorney. "The company is 75 years old, and they have employees that 
have been there 25 or 30 years, who grew up with the company." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's Holland Dutch Bakers, with its trademark blue windmills, was 
founded in 1915 by brothers-in-law Theodore J. Van de Kamp and Lawrence L. 
Frank, uncles of California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. The Van de Kamp 
family sold its interest in the company more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Van de Kamp products have been sold mostly in supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
A separate company under different ownership produces Van de Kamp's frozen 
foods.

HUGE CANADIAN OIL PROJECT CLOSE TO A DEAL

<P>
A multibillion-dollar project that will tap vast oil reserves off Newfoundland 
for U.S. refineries has finally overcome a series of delays and will be 
launched soon, industry sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The $4.4-billion (C$5.1 billion) Hibernia oil project has been beset by doubts, 
squabbles and delays, but oil companies and the federal and Newfoundland 
governments are reportedly resolving final details and close to a deal. 
</P>
<P>
The pact will be signed next week at the latest and construction will begin 
this month, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Production at Hibernia -- which was discovered in 1979 and is believed to 
contain between 525 million and 890 million barrels of oil -- will begin in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations over government aid and Newfoundland's participation in 
construction had in part delayed the project, which is designed to produce 
110,000 barrels of oil a day for refining on the East coast of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil Corp.'s Canadian unit holds a 28.1% stake in Hibernia, Gulf Canada 
Resources Ltd. owns 25%, government-owned Petro-Canada Inc. has another 25% and 
Chevron Corp.'s Canadian unit holds 21.9%.

Energy analysts were skeptical that the project would go ahead because it was 
not expected to be viable unless oil fetched $25 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
When the project was announced ahead of the November, 1988, elections -- with 
generous federal funding seen as a blatant attempt to buy votes in the East -- 
oil prices were well below $20 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
But the final agreement comes when oil prices have been driven above $30 a 
barrel by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc.: The Anaheim-based operator of Carl's Jr. 
restaurants reported net income of $5.1 million for its second fiscal quarter, 
up 7.7% from the second quarter of 1989. Revenue for the quarter was $125 
million, up 1.8% from the same period last year, despite the franchising or 
sale of 40 company-owned restaurants in Arizona during the first and second 
fiscal quarters. The company said the figures were encouraging in light of 
heavy competitive discounting in the market.

Waste Not: An unlikely competitor in hazardous waste disposal turns out to be 
the cement industry. Cement kilns are increasingly burning hazardous waste for 
fuel. Kilns not only neutralize the wastes but turn them into part of their 
finished product. LaFarge Corp.'s Systec Environmental division, which serves 
600 hazardous waste producers in the United States and Canada, says it can burn 
anything its customers produce: waste solvents, paints, inks, pharmaceuticals 
and cosmetics. A kiln operates at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, 800 degrees hotter 
than the typical waste incinerator. That exceeds the Environmental Protection 
Agency's guidelines for temperatures that neutralize hazardous compounds.

FORMER HUGHES EMPLOYEE WINS BIG JURY AWARD; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE WORKER SAYS HE WAS FIRED AFTER ACCUSING THE COMPANY OF 
OVERCHARGING ON DEFENSE CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY PLANS TO APPEAL.

<P>
A Superior Court jury awarded $1.95 million Tuesday to a former Hughes Aircraft 
Co. employee fired after he accused the company of overcharging the government 
on defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
After five days of deliberations, the jury found that Hughes discriminated 
against Bobby Coffey, 55, of Woodland Hills, because of his age and upheld his 
claims that Hughes charged the government for employee time not performed on 
various contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Coffey and I are extremely gratified," his lawyer, Melanie Lomax, said 
after the award was announced. 
</P>
<P>
"The part he was happiest about was the false (overcharges). The jury has sent 
Hughes a clear message not only on the honesty of billing charges, but on how 
they treat their longtime employees." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes spokesman Bill Herrman said Hughes was "disappointed" by the verdict and 
plans to appeal. A Hughes lawyer also attacked Coffey's work record. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey was first hired by Hughes in 1969 and was assigned as a programs control 
administrator charged with keeping tabs on the costs of government defense 
work. 
</P>
<P>
He was fired in December, 1989, allegedly for falsifying a time card, 
indicating that he had worked eight hours a day on two days in which he worked 
only half days. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey sued Hughes, charging that his time card offense was an oversight, that 
he should not have been fired for it and that the real reason he was dismissed 
was because he pointed out allegedly fraudulent practices Hughes engaged in by 
overcharging the government on defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey sought $8.5 million in punitive damages and lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
The jury awarded him $127,477 in general damages, $75,000 for his pain and 
suffering and $1.75 million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
"Hughes played games on U.S. defense contracts" by charging employee hours 
against projects they never worked on, Lomax said in closing arguments in the 
case last week. 
</P>
<P>
She said in one instance, Hughes charged the government $48,000 for materials 
that the company was able to obtain for $2,000, and on a secret project, 
charged $90,000 in employee time when actual charges totaled only $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Krischer denied Coffey's allegations that Hughes overcharged the government, 
saying some of the work employees did was for secret projects that they did not 
know about.

Univision Holdings Inc., the Hallmark Cards subsidiary that owns 
Spanish-language KMEX-TV in Los Angeles, said the station's general manager, 
Emilio Nicolas Jr., has resigned and been succeeded by Richard P. Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez joined KMEX-TV, Channel 34, in April as general sales manager from 
WHCT-TV in Hartford, Conn., where he was general manager and a partner. 
</P>
<P>
Although KMEX-TV has been doing well in ratings, station sources said 
management in New York had been increasingly concerned about costs, in 
particular losses associated with "L.A. Fiesta Broadway," a Cinco de Mayo 
street fair that the station sponsored and broadcast earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolas, whose father started what is believed to be the nation's first 
Spanish-language station in San Antonio, said he hoped to remain in the 
broadcasting field. JOHN LIPPMAN

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: CONSUMER STOCKS' RECENT DECLINE MAY LAST A WHILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Consumer stocks, the stars of the '80s, suddenly are Wall Street's biggest 
question mark. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, and particularly over the past few months, some of the 
best-known names in many key consumer products businesses have seen their 
stocks devastated. The culprit has been a slowdown in sales as consumers have 
tightened their belts or abandoned some former favorites for other products or 
brands. 
</P>
<P>
The casualty list includes fast-food king McDonald's, appliance maker Maytag, 
the Hartmarx men's clothing firm, textile giant Fieldcrest and retailers J. C. 
Penney and Toys R Us. All have seen their stocks fall far more than the 13% 
drop in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index from its peak. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts are calling this a normal cyclical drop in the stocks, tied to a 
normal cyclical decline in consumer spending that may or may not lead to 
outright recession. But there's a deeper fear lurking: What if some consumer 
goods and services sectors are entering not a cyclical decline but a secular 
one -- a trend that could extend well into the 1990s? 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Acuff, market strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham in New York, 
notes that many key consumer businesses already have tumbled into deep slumps. 
"We've lost the publishing stocks over the last few years, and we've lost the 
hotels, like Marriott and Hilton," he says. "Some might argue that we're now 
losing McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
The cold reality for consumer goods and services providers, Acuff says, is that 
"we're not going to see the exuberant consumer in the 1990s that we saw in the 
1980s." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the aging of the American population, and the maturing of the baby 
boomers, has long been expected to translate into slower consumer spending and 
a higher savings rate over time. The argument is that the boomers, in 
particular, have practically everything they need after their spending binge of 
the 1980s -- everything except the money to fund their children's college 
education or their own retirement. 
</P>
<P>
No one is suggesting that consumer spending is simply going to collapse. But if 
the trend over the next few years is for a greater emphasis on staying at home 
and saving than going out and spending, then the growth rates of many consumer 
companies may be lower than what Wall Street anticipates. The experience of 
McDonald's, Hartmarx and Penney could be an early warning. 
</P>
<P>
And for those consumers who need an extra push to exit the ranks of the 
freewheelers, Congress may soon oblige: A proposal now is circulating on 
Capitol Hill to impose a special federal "luxury" tax on purchases of goods 
such as jewelry and boats to help reduce the government's gaping budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Some money managers, however, warn that it could be folly to speak too 
generally about consumer trends. "We have a lifestyle in this country to be 
pretty good spenders," says Robert Kommerstad, chairman of Pasadena-based 
Provident Investment Counsel, a major investor in many consumer goods 
companies. While spending may slow, he says, to assume that America in the 
1990s will mimic Japan in the 1980s -- high savings, low consumption -- is 
probably going too far. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, companies in the food and drug businesses, among other consumer 
areas, sell goods that people can't very well go without, no matter what the 
economy, Kommerstad notes. And many of those companies also are big players 
overseas, which means they're much less dependent on the actions of American 
consumers than they were 10 years ago. "I don't think anything can get in the 
way of a consistent rate of growth for those companies," Kommerstad says. 
</P>
<P>
So far, that seems true for many of the firms. For example, at an Aug. 22 
meeting with analysts, Coca-Cola management "indicated that the soft drink 
business is as solid and predictable as ever," says analyst Lawrence Adelman at 
Dean Witter Reynolds. Recession or no, Coke is comfortable with analysts' 
estimates of $2 a share in earnings this year, up 20% from last year, Adelman 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Kommerstad also notes that a spending slowdown ultimately could benefit the 
strongest players in many consumer sectors, "because in tougher times the 
marginal guy gets squeezed." That could leave more market share for the 
strongest companies to grab. 
</P>
<P>
Still, investors now may need to worry as much about perception as reality in 
looking at consumer stocks. Retailers, food companies, apparel firms and 
leisure-time companies were red-hot stocks in the 1980s, riding the consumer 
spending boom. But no trend lasts forever, and when change comes it is often 
unrecognized -- and even denied -- by investors until it is well along. 
Remember how, in the mid-1980s, many investors refused to believe that small 
stocks could have peaked in 1983? 
</P>
<P>
If the market is suddenly perceiving that growth in consumer spending is coming 
down, and likely to stay down, the consumer stocks' still high 
price-to-earnings ratios could be slashed much more than they already have 
been. Even the strong players could be penalized, at least for a period of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can just write off these companies, but I agree that the 
(P/E) multiples are too high," says Fred Astman, a money manager at First 
Wilshire Securities in Los Angeles. Look at it this way: If the market decides 
that, in a slower spending environment, Toys R Us should sell for 15 times 
earnings rather than 20 times earnings, the stock would go from $23.50 now to 
$16.75, even though it has already plunged from $35. 
</P>
<P>
For investors who've ridden the consumer stocks' magnificent gains from the 
1980s, now may be a good time to consider selling at least a portion of your 
holdings, especially if your stocks still appear to be anticipating strong 
growth ahead. By next spring, we all may be filling the shopping malls again, 
buying like crazy. But in this market, hedging one's bet is the wiser move. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: The nation's regional stock exchanges are likely to merge with the 
major exchanges or disappear over the next 10 years, the chairman of the 
American Stock Exchange said Tuesday. In a speech in Washington, James Jones 
predicted that only the three largest stock markets -- the New York Stock 
Exchange, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers' over-the-counter market and 
Jones' own Amex -- will survive by the year 2000. That may sound self-serving, 
but Jones maintains that cost pressures are killing the smaller exchanges. . . 
. Torrance-based Standard Brands Paints, the home decorating retailer, is 
having a tough time in the slow economy. But Kansas City, Mo., investor John 
Latshaw continues to raise his stake in the chain. Latshaw, head of Latshaw 
Enterprises, bought 149,200 more Standard shares between July 10 and Aug. 30, 
according to an SEC filing. He paid between $8.75 and $12.125 apiece. The 
purchases raised Latshaw's stake to 811,515 shares, or 14.2%. Standard stock 
closed at $7.50 Tuesday, a 52-week low. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Board Options Exchange is introducing the first long-term put and 
call options on individual stocks, beginning Oct. 5. The options to be issued 
first will expire in either July, August or September, 1992, and will cover 14 
blue chip stocks, including AT&amp;T, Exxon, Boeing, IBM and McDonald's. 
Options currently extend for less than one year. The new options will give 
investors a long-term tool for hedging their holdings.

NYSE OKS AFTER-HOURS TRADING SESSIONS; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: IF APPROVED BY THE SEC, THE NEW TIMES WOULD BE THE FIRST STEPS 
TOWARD ROUND-THE-CLOCK ACTIVITY ON THE EXCHANGE.

<P>
The New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday approved two stages of its plan to 
implement 24-hour trading by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Approved were two trading periods, called crossing sessions, that would allow 
completion of trades after hours. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE board also approved a series of rules for trading after the exchange's 
regular hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board president Richard A. Grasso said the plan "reflects the NYSE's 
commitment to innovative services for its customers and positions the exchange 
competitively in the evolution of the 24-hour marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
NYSE Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. unveiled the extended trading plan earlier 
this year in response to increasing competition from other markets. 
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the exchange's five-part plan was introduced Aug. 3, 
permitting some late trades at the market closing price for orders already in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
The two after-hours trading sessions approved Tuesday would be instituted 
pending approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The first session would run from 4:15 to 5 p.m. and permit trading at the 
market's closing price. All orders placed during this session would be matched 
up and executed at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The second session, running from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m., would allow traders to 
execute computerized program trades based on aggregate prices tied to a market 
index. The NYSE said the fourth phase of its plan, targeted for 1991, would 
allow auctions several times during the night of all listed securities. The 
fifth phase would provide for conventional trading round the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan has said 24-hour trading is planned for the end of the decade, but other 
officials have said it could be in place within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Round-the-clock trading now exists in the foreign currency and U.S. Treasury 
bond markets, where dealers conduct transactions via telephone and computer 
links. The two Chicago futures markets plan to begin computerized, 
extended-hours trading in November. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the NYSE board approved the formation of a market for trading 
unregistered securities under a new federal regulation. The NYSE said the new 
market could be in place by early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange also has announced plans for trading unregistered 
securities, which are placed privately with big institutions. The SEC passed 
Rule 144a earlier this year easing trading of such securities.

ARABIAN ADVENTURE; 
</P>
<P>
MODERN EXPLORERS SIFT DESERT SANDS IN SEARCH OF LOST CITY OF UBAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE HORTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
T. E. Lawrence called it "the Atlantis of the sands," and it was so fabled a 
city that more than 50 years ago British explorer Bertram Thomas scoured the 
Rub al Khali (Empty Quarter) desert in search of it, until he ran low on food 
and water and was forced to abandon his search. 
</P>
<P>
But now, an eclectic team of explorers led by Nicholas Clapp, a soft-spoken Los 
Angeles filmmaker, believes it is on the road to finding the lost city of Ubar, 
deep in the desert of Oman. 
</P>
<P>
Their quest for the ancient metropolis, which was built around the trade in 
frankincense, has been attended by plenty of Arabian romance: fierce 
sandstorms, encounters with wild animals and now the complications of modern 
civilization -- the crisis in the nearby Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Clapp's hunt for Ubar began casually eight years ago with a bookseller's 
recommendation: "I went in looking for a book, and she handed me 'Arabia Felix' 
and said, 'You read this,' " he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
In the book, Thomas, a British Army officer, onetime aide to the Sultan of 
Oman, protege of Lawrence and one of only two Westerners to traverse the dunes 
of the Empty Quarter, described his unsuccessful mission to discover the ruins 
of the "great city." 
</P>
<P>
Clapp had been to Oman in 1980 and was looking for a project to take him back. 
After reading Thomas' 1932 account of the road to Ubar, Clapp had found his 
project: the search for Ubar. 
</P>
<P>
While other explorers had sifted the sands of time in search of the smallest 
clues, this expedition would be a high-tech archeological effort guided by 
computer-enhanced images from space, run by a team of amateur and professional 
explorers and financed by the Oman government. 
</P>
<P>
When Thomas gave up his search years ago, he carefully noted the coordinates of 
the road he believed led to the lost city before leaving the desert. "Some few 
days to the north . . .," said Thomas' guides as they labored under the desert 
sun to help the Western explorer map a road that someone might someday follow. 
</P>
<P>
Clapp, an Emmy Award-winning documentary filmmaker for Armand Hammer 
Productions, decided he would be that someone. Clapp began to read everything 
he could find about Ubar. He found tales of the lost city's splendor in 
everything from the Koran to "A Thousand and One Nights." 
</P>
<P>
Although separating fact from fantasy proved difficult in the diverse accounts, 
Clapp began to get a picture of the fabulously wealthy city that existed about 
the time the lucrative frankincense trade started. That city had thrived for at 
least 2,000 years before the birth of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Its prized incense, more valuable than gold during Ubar's heyday, came from 
trees found only in the hills of what is now the Dhofar region of Oman. An 
aromatic resin derived from tree sap, frankincense brought great wealth to 
those who controlled its harvest and distribution, including Ubar's residents. 
It was used in a wide range of rituals and ceremonies, including cremations and 
royal processions. 
</P>
<P>
But the Koran notes that great wealth did not lead to great happiness for the 
people of Ubar. Because they lived sinful lives and refused to repent, the 
Islamic holy work says, Allah ultimately destroyed their "many columned city . 
. . whose like has never been built in the whole land." 
</P>
<P>
"The whole key to the mystery and romance of ancient Arabia is rooted in the 
frankincense trade," Clapp said, noting that scholars have studied the trade 
"farther on up the route it was traded. But virtually nothing is known of the 
trade at its source." 
</P>
<P>
Clapp and colleagues have now begun to change that. This summer, after years of 
planning, Clapp, along with Los Angeles lawyer George Hedges, Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory geologist Ronald Blom, archeologist Juris Zarins and famed British 
explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, finally stood on the sands traversed by Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
They began unearthing what they hope will be evidence of the so-called Ad 
civilization that spawned the lost city of Ubar, if not the city itself. 
</P>
<P>
Their short expedition in July, staged in preparation for a major exploratory 
trip this winter, did not locate the city with certainty. 
</P>
<P>
But it did uncover artifacts -- about 900 pottery shards and flint pieces -- 
that suggest they are on the right tract. The frankincense trade route, at the 
least, has been discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Certain they have uncovered long-buried clues to the ancient people who built 
the trade, the men remain hopeful of finding Ubar. 
</P>
<P>
One obstacle may be the troubles in the Persian Gulf. Oman borders Saudi 
Arabia, and the next expedition, Clapp said, will "of course await the settling 
of hostilities." 
</P>
<P>
Clapp knew from the beginning that searching for the remnants of one small city 
in the vast and desolate Rub al Khali dunes would be a formidable task. And he 
had no intention of venturing into the desert until he had done as much 
preparation as possible. He began looking for ways that technology could help 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with only his historical references and with Thomas' notes about the lost 
road, Clapp approached Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy called up and said, 'I'm trying to find a lost city,' " recalled 
Ronald Blom, a JPL geologist. "My first thought was that this was a crank 
call." 
</P>
<P>
But as Blom listened to Clapp, he found himself engrossed in the project; 
before long, he and his boss, Charles Elachi, were part of the search. 
</P>
<P>
Elachi headed JPL's Shuttle Imaging Radar program, part of an effort to 
generate and use images from a sophisticated radar system carried on the space 
shuttles. He and Blom believed the radar might help locate traces of 
civilization in the Rub al Khali because it can produce images of objects 
buried in the sands. 
</P>
<P>
It did. In 1984, during the Challenger's next-to-last flight, the Shuttle 
Imaging Radar system gathered data as it passed over Oman. From that data, 
high-tech images were generated and later enhanced with images from French and 
American satellites. 
</P>
<P>
At almost exactly the spot noted by Thomas, in a stretch of Arabian desert so 
deserted that it is known as the "Empty Quarter," the men found evidence of a 
100-yard-wide road connected to dozens of other ancient roads in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Images in hand, Clapp turned his attention to assembling an expedition team, a 
job that proved to be less than difficult. "Everyone I spoke to was very 
enthusiastic about this project," Clapp said. 
</P>
<P>
JPL's Blom, already hooked into the Ubar quest, signed on for the expedition. 
Clapp also approached his friend, lawyer Hedges, who, as a student of classics 
and archeology, promised to bring another view to the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Nick knows that I am not a quitter. When I start something I make it happen," 
Hedges said. "And I had a real romantic feeling about this project right from 
the beginning. It really appealed to my spirit of adventure. It was immediate, 
full-blooded enthusiasm on my part." 
</P>
<P>
Realizing that they needed more technical guidance, the team approached Juris 
Zarins, an archeologist at Southwest Missouri State University, who had spent 
several years doing fieldwork in the Arabian desert. 
</P>
<P>
To complete the team, they invited Sir Ranulph Fiennes, a dashing British 
adventurer and explorer who had fought with the Sultan of Oman's forces during 
a rebellion in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the team in place, the expedition faced imposing obstacles, most 
of them financial. Ultimately, the team found support from various sources, 
including $15,000 from the Oman International Bank, free transportation from 
Gulf Air and full tactical support and transportation within Oman from its 
government, an absolute monarchy that rules the Kansas-sized country of 1.3 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
In Oman, the team received red-carpet treatment. Within days of arrival, the 
expedition had a helicopter, a pilot and ground vehicles from the Omani 
military, and a cadre of armed escorts from the Royal Omani Police. 
</P>
<P>
"We told the Omanis, 'There's a big hole in your history,' " Clapp said. " 'We 
know your ancestors controlled the most valuable commodity in the ancient 
world. But we don't know anything about the people who ran the trade prior to 
100 BC.' The Omanis were very interested in learning with us." 
</P>
<P>
Before they left the United States, Clapp and Zarins had compiled a list of 35 
sites to investigate. Almost immediately they began to uncover what 
archeologist Zarins believes are artifacts from the incense civilization. 
</P>
<P>
Some of what they found was from well-studied periods, including fragments of 
classical pottery. But Zarins was more excited about small bits of an 
indigenous, reddish-brown pottery discovered at several sites. "Some of the 
pottery was really different and represented an unexplored aspect of the 
region," Zarins said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the thrill of discovery, the expedition brought the hurdles that have 
historically troubled the most intrepid explorers. Raging sandstorms cut short 
the group's work in the Empty Quarter, where they had most expected to find the 
city of Ubar. Giant "heat-seeking" ticks chased them around a cave that they 
had entered to escape the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Tired of the ticks and concerned about the return of a leopard that also seemed 
to inhabit the cave, the men resumed their desert search, only to come upon a 
deadly Arabian viper. Not far from that, they came upon a scorpion. 
</P>
<P>
But the trip also had its serendipitous moments. One day while driving between 
two sites, Zarins and Hedges stopped for a cold drink. Near the car, Zarins 
noticed something strange. "Archeologists are trained to look for things in the 
landscape that are out of place. I noticed some nearby stones that rose too 
high, so we went to investigate," Zarins said. 
</P>
<P>
There the men found more of the indigenous pottery as well as evidence of 
structures that they believe tie the site to the incense trade. 
</P>
<P>
"We went looking for clues to a lost city," Hedges said, "and we came back with 
what may well prove to be evidence of an entire civilization."

A TOAST TO TRUMPS' ART OF THE MEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dine at Trumps and some notables will be looking over your shoulder. In 
celebration of its 10th anniversary, the Westside restaurant has chosen 29 
portraits of prominent locals to peer down on its diners. The paintings are by 
14 artists. The main piece is a series of 40 photographic portraits by David 
Hockney hanging over the bar. 
</P>
<P>
"Restaurants are about people," said co-owner and chef Michael Roberts. "What 
could be better than having people on the walls?" 
</P>
<P>
A close second might be wall-to-wall people filling the restaurant for the 
exhibit's opening Monday evening. It was a crowd heavy with art lovers who 
generally applauded the idea of showcasing art in restaurants. "It's a great 
idea," said Henry Geldzahler, former curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
in New York. "It works as decor. Sometimes it even works as art." 
</P>
<P>
"The more exposure, the better," said artist David Limrite. I don't care where 
it hangs." Artist Ian Falconer liked the idea of portraits in restaurants. 
"It's a nice change. They usually have a lot of minimalists." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, both Hockney and Geldzahler quoted the line by Peter De Vries: 
"Art is so bad in restaurants to get back at museums for serving such lousy 
food." 
</P>
<P>
There seemed to be no complaints about either the food or the art from the 
artists and subjects present. The painters included Don Bachardy, Sylvia Shap, 
Falconer, Kim McCarty, Limrite, Joe Fay and Ron Meyers. Among the subjects were 
Marcia Weisman, Dr. Arnie Klein, Earl McGrath, Morris Pynoos, Mario Tamayo, 
Michael McCarty, Thom Guitterez, Daniel Adams, William Escalera, Sabato 
Fiorello, and Joan and Jack Quinn and their daughters Amanda and Jennifer. 
</P>
<P>
One guest who saw social commentary in the scene was J.C. Suares, creative 
director of Connoisseur magazine, who said, "It used to be that artists were 
famous and cooks cooked. Now cooks are famous and artists do the clowning 
around. But don't worry, the '80s are bound to come to an end sometime."

It's not unusual for 17-year-old Daniel Cooper to wake up at 4 a.m., tiptoe 
quietly out of his house and into his van, then pull slowly away from the front 
curb. 
</P>
<P>
Most parents would squawk that such behavior is for the birds. Cooper's know 
it's for the bird-watching. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been interested in birds since he was about 5 years old," said Daniel's 
mother, Lily Cooper. "Before he knew how to drive, his dad and I would take him 
on these bird walks and he would be the only one there who wasn't an adult. In 
fact, there weren't even any teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Cooper contributes a regular column on bird-watching, or birding, as it 
is called, to a monthly newsletter published by the Friends of the Los Angeles 
River, a conservation group. And recently, the San Marino High School senior 
completed his "Beginners' Bird Guide to San Marino and Vicinity." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper wrote and illustrated the 27-page booklet, which features pen-and-ink 
drawings of about 50 of the most common species in the area. The guide 
describes, among other things, each bird's markings, the sound it makes, its 
habitat and its migratory patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he embarked on the project after leading bird walks for the Los 
Angeles and Pasadena Audubon societies, as well as for the Huntington Library 
Art Collections and Botanical Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the people who go out on the tours are really interested in birds, 
but they don't know a lot about them," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's booklet, which was put together with the assistance of the Huntington 
Library, is sold at the library's bookstore, as well as at the Eaton Canyon 
Nature Center and the El Molino Viejo, which is run by the San Marino 
Historical Society. He also plans to sell the guides while leading bird walks 
around the area. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the market is," he said, rolling his eyes. "If you can even call 
it that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Cooper spends many Saturdays at local parks and other areas where 
common birds can be found, the real thrill for him is spotting rare ones. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of such birds as the blue-footed booby, the yellow-bellied 
flycatcher and the black-billed cuckoo, Cooper has ventured on daylong and 
overnight expeditions to desert oases in the state such as the Morongo Valley 
and Mojave Narrows Regional Park. He also has traveled to coastal communities 
such as Newport Back Bay, Central Park in Huntington Beach and Point Loma in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Once while he was in Deep Springs, in Mono County about 300 miles north of Los 
Angeles, he and a birding companion spotted a rare eastern phoebe. When they 
returned and reported their sighting, they were met with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"We told these guys who are well known Los Angeles County birders, but because 
it's a rare bird they didn't believe us," he said with a shrug. "Sometimes 
people don't take me seriously because of my age." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when he was as young as 10, Cooper's parents indulged his interest in 
birding and accompanied him on organized tours and walks. 
</P>
<P>
"When I used to go out with my dad, people thought he was the birder and that I 
was just a kid who didn't know anything," Cooper recalled. "But really it was 
the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
Now that he is older and doesn't have to take his parents along, Cooper's hobby 
has really taken off. Knowing about birds has meant learning about Southern 
California's natural habitats. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain birds you can't find unless you can recognize a red fir or a 
lodgepole pine," he said, referring to the types of trees where certain birds 
forage. "You can't be into birding without knowing about ecology, nature and 
the seasons." 
</P>
<P>
He has even learned a bit about development and politics. "Suddenly it's not an 
issue you read about in the paper," Cooper said. "When you see barren land and 
a bulldozer where a row of Joshua trees used to be, you get involved on a 
personal level."

Frank Pierson, who directed HBO's tough drama about capital punishment, 
"Somebody Has to Shoot the Picture," which airs again tonight on HBO, was a 
magazine journalist, working in Life magazine's Beverly Hills office, when he 
decided in the mid-'50s to try his hand at script-writing. It was the family 
trade; his mother had been a writer at Warner Bros.

Pierson took his $7,000 in profit-sharing and made it last two years. He grew a 
beard and sold nary a word. "On a Friday, the money was all gone and I shaved 
my beard so I could go job-hunting on Monday. You couldn't wear a beard and get 
a job in those days." 
</P>
<P>
But that Friday afternoon his agent called to report first that he had sold one 
of Pierson's teleplays and second that he'd found Pierson a job as a story 
editor on "Have Gun Will Travel." 
</P>
<P>
Pierson broke into directing doing episodes of "Have Gun." Later he directed 
"The Looking Glass War" as his first feature, and then the Barbra Streisand 
remake of "A Star Is Born" and "King of the Gypsies." As a screenwriter, he 
adapted "Cool Hand Luke," won an Oscar for his script of "Dog Day Afternoon" 
and recently co-authored "Presumed Innocent." 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody Has to Shoot the Picture" was an original screenplay by Doug Magee, 
who as a Newsweek reporter-photographer had published a book in 1980 called 
"Slow Coming Dark" about a dozen Death Row inmates. The script had been 
optioned and dropped before Robert Cooper, a senior vice president of HBO, took 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The project became viable when Roy Scheider agreed to play the burnt-out 
photographer -- for Time magazine -- who agrees to photograph the execution of 
a condemned man, at the condemned man's request. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had strong feelings against capital punishment," Pierson said at lunch a 
few days ago, "ever since I read Arthur Koestler's very convincing arguments on 
the moral issues involved. Does society have the right at all to take a life? 
And isn't the chance of an error too great for execution to be accepted by a 
society that thinks of itself as moral?" 
</P>
<P>
Magee's plot is highly melodramatic, a thickly plotted and suspenseful crime 
thriller; but, within Death Row itself, the film has the feeling of a 
docudrama, and the detailings -- including the mad mumblings and shoutings in 
the background -- were thoroughly researched, Pierson says. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's Starke Prison near Gainesville was used for some establishing shots. 
The execution chamber itself was a set at Universal's new sound stages in 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
"The witnesses are very close to the electric chair, no further than the next 
table," Pierson said, gesturing perhaps eight feet away. In an eerily touching 
moment, the warden kisses the condemned man on the forehead and whispers to 
him. The incident is based on a report from a witness at an actual execution. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea," Pierson says, "is that the Death Row guards and the prison 
officials try to make the prisoner feel like a member of a team, as if they all 
have this thing to do well and they're all in it together. They're very afraid 
of violence at that last minute, and they try to brainwash the prisoners into 
thinking that violence would be a betrayal of the team, of their trust. But 
they've also got some control devices you don't see and they can break a man's 
arm very quickly if he starts to struggle." 
</P>
<P>
The film's ending goes against conventional expectations and is the stronger 
for it. An alternative ending was written and shot and will be used in a 
European theatrical version, which Universal will distribute. 
</P>
<P>
"The networks like to pick challenging subjects for their films," Pierson says. 
"But in the end they often trivialize them. This one follows through on the 
premise that is set up. It's a powerful experience for the audience whether you 
think Ray (played by Arliss Howard) is guilty or not. You're still faced with 
what it means to execute a man." 
</P>
<P>
HBO's Cooper, who also OKd the recent production called "Seductions," short 
stories by Hemingway, Dorothy Parker and Mary McCarthy, may be helping to point 
the way, Pierson feels, toward a newly attractive boldness and innovation in 
cable programming. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the potential," he says, "of a nurturing, encouraging creative 
environment that would make possible here what exists in London. I mean those 
crossovers in which actors, writers, directors, producers can move freely and 
easily between the stage and television, or the stage and television." 
</P>
<P>
Pierson, a former president of the Writers Guild, has become so active in the 
Sundance Institute in Utah that he's bought a place of his own near by. There 
he and such colleagues as Larry Kasdan, Walter Bernstein and Sydney Pollack 
help young writers and directors develop new projects. 
</P>
<P>
"You read about those astronomical prices being paid for scripts that don't 
sound that wonderful. But the good news is that the studios are more aware than 
ever that stories are important, scripts are everything." 
</P>
<P>
Pierson is wearing a beard again. 
</P>
<P>
The film airs on Tuesday and on Sept. 22, 24, 27 and 30.

RATFINK: Ed (Big Daddy) Roth, the hot rod designer, cartoonist and

"That was it," says the creator of the obese rodent, "Ratfink." "That was the

BANKING: Despite concern that some major money-center banks could fail and wipe 
out the federal insurance fund if a major recession hits the nation (A1), 
Orange County's 38 small community banks are so far doing better than expected, 
says industry consultant Gerry Findley of Brea. . . . The locals chalked up a 
combined $11.6-million profit for the first quarter, and soon-to-be-released 
second-quarter figures should show better results, he says. James Granelli and

<P>
Orange County prosecutors Tuesday filed assault and weapons charges against a 
white teen-ager, two white men and one black man as a result of a street fight 
that resulted in near-fatal head injuries to a 15-year-old black Garden Grove 
girl. However, they ruled out race as a motive for the violence. 
</P>
<P>
The only felony charges were filed against the 17-year-old white youth, who 
prosecutors believe threw a shard of heavy sliding-door glass that nearly 
killed Amber Jefferson, whose mother is white and father is black. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on Amber, a cheerleader at Santiago High School, has become a 
centerpiece for civil rights activists to focus public attention on their 
convictions that racism is prevalent in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi on Tuesday harshly criticized those 
community leaders who have called the Amber Jefferson attack a racial issue and 
defended his decision not to seek hate-crime charges against anyone in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that various sources will express themselves without being privy 
to the facts," Capizzi said at a news conference. "It's easy to comment and 
make statements that border on hysteria and get the community upset, but which 
have no factual basis." 
</P>
<P>
Amber Jefferson's mother, Cody Donnelly, was incredulous at Capizzi's decision 
not to seek hate-crime charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my God, what's going on?" she said. "This is just incredible to me. My 
daughter is still in very bad condition and anyone who says this thing was 
blown out of proportion doesn't know what we've been through." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state attorney general's office said Tuesday it will proceed 
with its own review of the case despite the district attorney's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very much concerned about the allegations in this case," said Rudy 
DeLeon, special assistant to Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. "That's his 
(district attorney's) evaluation based upon the facts he has, but we would also 
be concerned about making an evaluation based on the data." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Sheriff's Department, in sending prosecutors the results of 
its three-week investigation into the incident, had included "race hate 
violations" as one of several possible charges to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
But Capizzi said his office rejected filing any race hatred charges after a 
thorough review of the state statutes and the investigators' reports on the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Racism was not the cause of the fight or of Amber's injuries," Capizzi said. 
He added that "this was a street brawl" that started with two white girls 
fighting over a boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Amber was injured Aug. 7 shortly after midnight in the parking lot of a Stanton 
condominium complex where she was staying for a few days. Twelve people from 
the two sides fighting were involved altogether, but she was the only person 
seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
A team of surgeons operated for more than 10 hours on her head injuries. The 
most serious injury was a split on the left side of her head that ran from 
above her eyes to her chin and ran deep enough to break her jawbone. Her jaw 
remains wired and doctors say she may not fully recover for another three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Amber and those with her say some of the whites called them "nigger" before the 
fighting broke out. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said that although racial slurs were made by some of the whites against 
the blacks, "it did not escalate" to the level of a violation of the race 
hatred statute. 
</P>
<P>
The decision brought a sharp reaction from Amber's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very disappointed that no race crimes have been charged and that (one) 
of Amber's friends has been charged," said Carol Sobel, an American Civil 
Liberties Union attorney representing the Jefferson family. "I have read the 
D.A.'s account of the events, and we simply do not agree with them." 
</P>
<P>
Black community leaders who had already condemned the Sheriff's Department for 
not making a quick arrest in the incident were also harsh in their criticism of 
Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
"To deny what is unfortunately an ugly aspect of day-to-day life in Orange 
County is, in fact, to allow things to get worse," said Mark Ridley-Thomas, 
executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission, which had asked authorities to look into racial overtones to the 
incident, defended Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the fact that (the district attorney) is going to prosecute someone 
for a particularly vicious crime overshadows whether or not the hate crimes act 
is used. . . . The most important thing is that the person who cut Amber is 
brought to justice; that will send as strong a message as anything." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said a major problem has been the number of conflicting stories from 
witnesses about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, when the youths from Amber's group were first 
interviewed, they never said anything about racial slurs. It wasn't until 
subsequent interviews that they mentioned them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi also said one of the youths who was with Amber the night of the attack 
told authorities that some in that group encouraged him to claim it was a 
racially motivated incident because he could make $1,000 as his share of the 
proceeds in a civil lawsuit. Capizzi said that youth is adamant that race was 
not involved. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi also defended Sheriff Brad Gates' staff for not making an immediate 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better to take your time and do things right than to hurry and have to do 
them over again," he said. Capizzi said the criticism was unfair because the 
youth considered responsible for Amber's injury was taken into custody nearly 
24 hours after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Although he wasn't charged then, he was held as a probation violator because of 
his involvement in the incident. A Sheriff's Department spokesman said the 
youth was on probation for burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said charges might have been filed earlier if the sheriff had received 
better cooperation from witnesses. One other problem, he said, was that Amber 
herself "did not know exactly who or what had caused her injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Amber and a small group of friends had just returned to the condominium complex 
when a white girl in her group confronted another white girl she had argued 
with earlier about a mutual boyfriend. Suddenly, according to various accounts, 
two young white men appeared with baseball bats; some of the blacks with Amber 
grabbed 2-by-4 boards, and a fight broke out. The Sheriff's Department, in its 
report to prosecutors, said there may be grounds for charging all 12 people 
involved from the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
But Capizzi said his office decided to restrict the charges to violations where 
there was a good chance of a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old accused of a felony faces charges of mayhem, assault with a 
deadly weapon, infliction of great bodily injury and battery. He could receive 
a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison if convicted on all charges. Capizzi 
said his office will ask that he be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
The other three were charged only with misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
Included was the youth's father, Earl Wimberly, 42, accused of assault and 
exhibiting a deadly weapon. A third white charged is Trevor McClure, 21, 
accused of exhibiting a deadly weapon and challenging to fight. The only black 
charged was Louis Jones, 19, accused of fighting in public and malicious 
mischief. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jones was the only one from Amber's group charged, Capizzi said that 
group may have been responsible for starting the incident. He said members of 
the group had been drinking at a motel earlier that night and were loud enough 
to cause the manager to complain. 
</P>
<P>
The group then headed to the condominium complex with the specific intent "of 
engaging in a fight," Capizzi said, because of an earlier confrontation between 
the white girls. 
</P>
<P>
Although Capizzi did not agree with those who claimed the incident was racial, 
he insisted his office and the Sheriff's Department are sensitive to 
allegations that a race question was involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's safe to say that there was much more extensive effort (in the 
investigation) once that was injected into it, because it's something the 
county is very much concerned with," Capizzi said. "I don't think Orange 
Countians will tolerate that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
But his answers did not satisfy many of Amber's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever something like this happens, it's always like we are the agitators 
and we're stepping out of bounds," said the Rev. James Carrington, pastor of 
the Friendship Baptist Church in Yorba Linda. "Despite what officials say, we 
are aware of similar incidents of prejudice and abuse that are flaring up in 
Orange County."

OIL BAN: Among lobbyists in Washington for an offshore oil drilling ban (A3) 
was a group from Orange County. The group made the trip because, Laguna Beach 
Mayor Lida Lenny says, "We had a spill, so we know what we're talking about." 
In February, a tanker ran aground and dumped nearly 400,000 gallons of crude 
oil off Huntington Beach. . . . The Orange County group also included John 
Sibley of the Orange County Environmental Management Agency, Newport Beach City 
Councilwoman Ruthelyn Plummer and Orange County League of Cities President

DAYS, $7 FOR EACH DAY AFTER THAT. BUSINESS AND VACATION FLIERS ALIKE ARE

Marion Young wasn't leaving on a trip Tuesday. She was just scouting the 
parking situation at John Wayne Airport in preparation for a weekend flight. 
</P>
<P>
When she discovered that the long-term parking lot on Main Street across the 
San Diego Freeway from the airport will be closed when the new terminal opens 
Sunday, and that the alternative is going to cost her significantly more, she 
decided to leave her car at home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's outrageous, but what can you do?" Young said. "I'll just have 
to have a friend drive me. You can buy an airline ticket to Seattle for what 
they want you to pay for four or five days (parking) here." 
</P>
<P>
While $49 flights to Seattle are hard to find, many travelers will be paying 
that amount to park their cars for five days at the new Thomas F. Riley 
Terminal. That's a hefty increase from the $30 that travelers are accustomed to 
paying for the same amount of time in the Main Street lot. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Sunday, the Main Street lot's 1,843 parking spaces that cost $6 per 
day will be closed. Customers will instead be directed to one of three parking 
garages next to the terminal and charged $14 for the first two days, $7 for 
each day after that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's disgusting," said one business traveler from Costa Mesa who 
parked her minivan in the Main Street lot Tuesday. "I went over there (to the 
terminal parking) and pulled in and got to thinking that $14 is a lot. So I 
drove over here." 
</P>
<P>
The county spent $86.3 million to build three garages next to the new terminal 
that nearly doubled the airport's parking capacity to about 8,400 spaces. One 
of the garages opened last year and currently charges a daily maximum rate of 
$12. 
</P>
<P>
But beginning Sunday, all three garages will charge a maximum of $14 a day. The 
county arrived at that rate after calculating what was necessary to pay for the 
cost of construction and still remain competitive in the market, assistant 
airport manager Jan Mittermeier said. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers indicated in surveys conducted for the county that they preferred 
parking closer to the terminal and were willing to pay more for the 
convenience, Mittermeier said. Most of those surveyed were business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the county concluded that the Main Street lot, sometimes called 
the remote lot, would be unnecessary because of the new, ample parking and, in 
addition, inefficient to operate. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have most parkers around the terminal -- and that is what we believe 
most travelers will want -- and we keep the remote lot open, I still have to 
run the shuttle out there every 10 or 15 minutes, even if only four cars are 
parked there," Mittermeier said. "It's just not cost-effective for us to have 
that lot open and run the shuttle." 
</P>
<P>
Survey aside, Wayne Taylor, a salesman from Coto de Caza, is one business 
traveler who said Tuesday that he would prefer to park in the Main Street lot 
and ride the shuttle to the terminal to avoid the "hassles" of traffic. But he 
indicated that he will use the new parking facilities and let his company 
absorb the cost. 
</P>
<P>
"I just pass the expenses on," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Nearing of Mission Viejo said the rate hike is prompting him to 
consider taking his business elsewhere. He said it would be worthwhile for him 
to drive the extra 15 minutes to Lindbergh Field in San Diego to avoid the 
ever-worsening traffic in and around John Wayne Airport and, now, the higher 
parking rates. Long-term parking at Lindbergh costs $7.50 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it really hurts for someone to be dipping into my wallet and I don't 
have a choice," Nearing said. 
</P>
<P>
After Saturday, the Main Street lot will be used only to accommodate overflow 
traffic during busy times such as holiday weekends, and if demand ever exceeds 
the new parking capacity, according to Phyllis Bartolini, manager of Ampco 
Parking, the company that runs the airport's parking facilities. Until then, 
the lot will remain empty and its shuttle buses in storage, Bartolini said. 
</P>
<P>
Cars parked in the lot before Sunday can stay there, but shuttle service will 
cease Saturday night when Ampco Parking's old contract with the airport 
expires, said Bill Pemberton, an airport operations manager. To retrieve their 
cars, he added, people will have to take a taxi or walk to the lot. 
</P>
<P>
If the Main Street lot is ever used again, it will have hourly rates of $1 and 
a maximum daily rate of $7. 
</P>
<P>
Short-term parking is uneffected by the changes, with the hourly rate staying 
at $1. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather pay half as much," vacation-flier Joe Wells from El Toro said. "But 
what choice do we have about it?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PARKING CHANGES AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT 
</P>
<P>
Through Saturday 
</P>
<P>
No changes 
</P>
<P>
Short-term parking will continue to be in southwest parking garage (B1). 
Long-term 
</P>
<P>
parking continues at remote lot on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
After Sunday 
</P>
<P>
Remote lot is closed to public. People who left cars there can get them out, 
but no new parking there will be permitted. No shuttle service for the remote 
lot. Short-term and long-term parking will differ only in price, not location. 
The east parking garage (A2, B2) and the northwest parking garage (A1) will 
open for the first time.

RECYCLING PROGRAM DELAYED TILL JANUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although city officials had hoped to begin a new recycling program this month, 
delays in permit hearings for a processing plant that will handle the refuse 
have pushed back the start date to the beginning of January. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, approved earlier this year, all refuse from the city will be 
taken to a plant in Stanton, where recyclable materials will be separated from 
the garbage using magnetic and weight-sensitive machinery. 
</P>
<P>
The city's 10-year contract with CR Transfer Inc. guarantees that at least 25% 
of the garbage collected in the city will be recycled, without residents having 
to separate plastics, glass or newspapers out of their trash bins. 
</P>
<P>
Until the plant is ready to accept the city's refuse, Newport Beach will 
continue its curbside newspaper pickup.

$639,000 TO SUPPORT SCIENCE PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine biology professor Eloy Rodriguez has received a $639,000 grant to 
support science education programs and science summer camps for minority and 
low-income children. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year award was given by the California Postsecondary Education 
Commission's Eisenhower Grant Program, university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It will help pay for Rodriguez's KIDS camp (Kids Inventing and Discovering 
Science), an intensive four-week summer school program at UCI for about 50 
bilingual and Spanish-speaking students ages 5 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
"A growing number of youngsters are left out of the educational loop, 
particularly if they are poor or not proficient in English," said Rodriguez, 
who recalled excelling in high school science classes yet was discouraged from 
pursuing college by guidance counselors. 
</P>
<P>
"The KIDS program was designed to engage these students and to keep them 
excited about scientific inquiry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, 43, who studies toxicology in plants, said the summer camp will be 
expanded next year to include children from other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
The funds will also help support Project Storyline: Science, a model that 
Rodriguez and his colleagues are developing for teacher training and science 
instruction for children in kindergarten through eighth grades. The aim is to 
create 35 instructional courses that deal with basic scientific concepts. 
Twelve of those courses will be translated into Spanish.

COMPUTERS TO OFFER A 'LOOK' AT HISTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
History students can rely on more than their imaginations this year as they try 
to envision the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s face when he delivered his famous 
"I Have a Dream" speech. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of computer technology, those students will soon be able to 
summon programs that display King's image on screen, speaking as if in a 
television documentary. 
</P>
<P>
They will also be able to read the text of the address or any other important 
speeches of the era. 
</P>
<P>
"I get the chills just thinking about it," said Wick Lobo, a teacher at 
Thurston Middle School who also conducts computer classes for the Orange County 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
New computer equipment will be delivered to the school as a result of a 
$160,000 investment by the district and its fund-raising group, SchoolPower. 
Administrators say students at all grade levels will benefit from the addition 
of 48 new computers districtwide. Included are word-processing, database and 
spreadsheet programs, much like those found in businesses, Lobo said. 
</P>
<P>
New computer laboratories will be set up with 15 computers each at Thurston and 
Laguna Beach High School, while older computers from the high school will be 
used as an additional learning tool at the elementary schools. LESLIE EARNEST

CITY TAKES ACTION TO SAFEGUARD TRASH

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council gave tentative approval this week to an ordinance to prohibit 
the taking of recyclable trash from curbsides by anyone but the city's contract 
trash hauler. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-scavenging ordinance coincides with the start of the city's 
residential recycling program on Oct. 1, Assistant City Manager Gerard Goedhart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fear is that individuals will go by and pick up the materials that have 
been put out, taking them for their own personal gain," he said. "We have to 
make it clear that that is stealing from the public." 
</P>
<P>
The money received from recycling the material will be used to defray the cost 
of the curbside containers and the pickup of the material, Goedhart said. 
</P>
<P>
"The success of the program depends on the amount of materials collected," he 
said. "There are some very organized people out there who would try to take 
advantage of this. We want them to know that under no circumstances will we 
allow scavenging." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question from Councilman Anthony R. Selvaggi, city officials 
acknowledged that enforcement of the ordinance will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The number of days when trash is collected within the city by Briggeman 
Disposal will increase from one to four per week beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"This will reduce the geographical area the Police Department will have to 
watch over any given day," Goedhart said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are encouraged to call police if they notice any suspicious behavior 
around their curbside trash. 
</P>
<P>
Fines for violating the ordinance have not been determined, but Goedhart 
estimated that they would begin at $100 for a first offense and rise with each 
additional offense. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will be considered for final approval at the council's Sept. 24 
meeting.KATHIE BOZANICH

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PIGEON FANCIERS FROWN ON CITY'S 10-BIRD LIMIT

Bogdan (Bugsy) Symanski's hobby is racing his homing pigeons. But someone in 
town wishes his pigeons would leave home for good. 
</P>
<P>
Since an anonymous caller complained to the city about the dozens of pigeons 
Symanski keeps in his back-yard loft on Law Drive, Symanski has found himself 
in the middle of a flap. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was a neighbor," said Symanksi, 35, a self-employed machinist 
who emigrated from Poland in 1973. "All seven of my neighbors signed a petition 
saying they didn't find the birds a nuisance. I think it might have been a 
jealous flyer." 
</P>
<P>
Such an unhappy cross-town rival may have nevertheless set into motion a chain 
of events which both neighbors and other pigeon-racing fanciers are watching. 
</P>
<P>
Symanski was supposed to appear in court on Aug. 29 to face misdemeanor charges 
of violating the city ordinance that prohibits keeping more than 10 birds. But 
in stepped the California State Pigeon Racing Assn. Attorney Paul Volchok, 
representing the association, argued that the city's regulations made the sport 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a minimum of 50 pigeons," he said. "You really need 100 pigeons to be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
To race, the pigeon owners, or "flyers," arrange to have their birds banded and 
then trucked to a remote location. On a recent Saturday in Stanton, for 
example, several local groups (Symanski belongs to one called the L.A. Rams) 
were preparing for a race. The birds would be trucked to Delano in the Central 
Valley, about 160 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The distance between the race release point and the flyer's home is measured in 
one-thousandths of a yard. The winner is the bird that travels the distance the 
fastest, allowing for the different trip lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Although some Garden Grove council members expressed sympathy for people who 
might not want to live near a flock of birds, the council directed the city 
attorney's office to postpone prosecution until Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working with" the racing association, said Greg Devereux, director of 
housing and neighborhood development, which is responsible for code 
enforcement. "The feeling is that some of what they're asking seems 
reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the groups' requests is an increase in the number of birds 
permitted. 
</P>
<P>
The sport has its rewards beyond trophies and ribbons, says racing secretary 
Bob Schneider of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a thrill to see a bird released 160 miles away approaching a block away. 
It takes you out of your everyday world."JIM TORTOLANO

Two teachers from the Santa Ana Unified School District have been chosen as 
Orange County Teachers of the Year for 1990-91, Supt. Rudy Castruita announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the history of the competition that two teachers from 
the same district have been selected by the Orange County Department of 
Education, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dee Gomez, an English-as-a-second-language teacher at Santa Ana High School, 
and Lynn Maher, an English teacher at MacArthur Fundamental Intermediate 
School, were the winners, Castruita announced at a school board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a real feather in our teacher corps' caps," Castruita said. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, who was in the audience, said she was "overwhelmed" by the honor. Being 
a good teacher means "total commitment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't look at a kid just when he's in your classroom. You also need to 
look at him when he's outside your classroom," she said. "It's the whole 
student." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez and Maher will now compete for California Teacher of the Year, which will 
be selected by the state Department of Education.

SUPERVISORS ORDER STUDY OF 'SRO' HOTELS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THE ORANGE COUNTY REVIEW OF THE LOW-COST HOSTELRIES PIONEERED IN SAN 
DIEGO IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN 60 DAYS.

<P>
With Orange County struggling to find affordable housing for its growing 
population of low-income working people and welfare recipients, county 
supervisors Tuesday ordered a study of an innovative housing program initiated 
in San Diego and emulated across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Orange County study will focus on construction of 
single-room-occupancy hotels, which are clustered residential living areas that 
resemble college dormitories, often featuring shared bathroom and cooking 
areas. The 60-day review will be conducted by the Environmental Management 
Agency, which is expected to return with specific recommendations for zoning 
and building code changes that would allow for development of the hotels in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
SROs, as the residential hotels are known, have been successfully tested in San 
Diego, and Orange County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, a leading advocate of SRO 
construction, said Tuesday that the facilities "would truly be something that 
would be effective in terms of helping the homeless people of this county." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who co-chaired an SRO task force with Stanton, 
agreed, calling the prospects of residential hotel construction in Orange 
County "excellent" and predicting that some of the facilities could be built as 
early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
Since San Diego launched an SRO program in 1987, the idea has spread to cities 
across the country, but it has been slow to catch on in Orange County, where 
the area's wealth often has obscured a dire shortage of low-income housing. If 
the supervisors approve the needed building and zoning changes, officials 
predict that SRO development will quickly take off because the area's acute 
housing shortage has created a demand for the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lennon, community affairs director for the Orange County Building Industry 
Assn., said local developers already have expressed interest in building SROs. 
The BIA is planning to hold a workshop at the end of October to brief 
prospective developers on building the residential hotels. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be a moment too soon, say county officials and housing advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing more and more working poor people in this county," said Larry 
Leaman, director of the county's Social Services Agency. "We have more and more 
people coming forward needing food stamps and needing welfare and needing 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
The county's review will be aided by a new guide to SRO development prepared by 
area cities, building industry officials and county staff members. That 
document, entitled "Orange County SRO Housing Development Guide," was presented 
to the board Tuesday and was quickly hailed by housing advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"They're calling this the SRO cookbook," said Judy Lenthall, president of 
HomeAid, a nonprofit housing corporation backed by the Building Industry Assn. 
of Southern California. "But I've been calling it the SRO New Testament. It's 
fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
Lenthall, who drafted the much-admired San Diego program, called the Orange 
County guide the "latest and greatest in SRO planning and development in the 
nation" and predicted that it would be widely used by city and county 
governments trying to pave the way for SRO construction in their areas. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County cities assisted in drafting the report, and their cooperation 
would be needed to make widespread development of the residential hotels 
possible. Most of the county's densely populated areas are incorporated, so 
merely amending the county zoning laws would not have any direct effect on the 
laws of cities. 
</P>
<P>
The cities' support seems solid, however, as 16 of them were represented on the 
task force that produced the guide, and the local League of California Cities 
chapter heartily endorsed it.

Indeed, SRO construction has found support from a broad range of 
constituencies: Conservative Republicans such as Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Jack Kemp -- who commended Stanton on Orange County's guide -- see 
them as a way for the private sector to address a social need. And liberal 
Democrats hail them as a way to alleviate homelessness.

"This program has no politics," Lenthall said. "Orange County is ripe, and 
they've finally matured enough to recognize the importance of affordable 
housing. I'm very optimistic."

WHY DIDN'T BUSH FIRST GET CITIZENS OUT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one has asked Bush why he reacted so quickly in the Gulf crisis with the 
embargo and show of military force and did not act first to protect and get the 
Americans and other foreign people out of there. 
</P>
<P>
Why was it such a surprise to him that they were taken hostage? Also, now this 
afterthought of asking for military and monetary help from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
During the first week of this crisis, a reporter asked Bush a question (while 
he was on vacation in Maine), and his reply was a very sharp "I don't mix 
business and pleasure." Who was minding the store?

<P>
First, before we start to cry over spilled milk, I would like to say I think we 
should have waited to follow the U.N. lead and not gone into Saudi Arabia like 
charging elephants.

<P>
Now that we are there, how to get out and not lose one American or Arab boy to 
this debacle is our problem. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say to the U.N., "What do you want us to do?" and do it.

<P>
Nothing wimpy about that. I think the whole world would breathe a sigh of 
relief and the lives of thousands would be saved.

<P>
I am not taking a guilt trip from Secretary of State James Baker, who said, "We 
have to stay united."

<P>
No one asked me if I wanted in and no one is asking me if I want out. I'm 
saying I want us out in our unilateral role and back the U.N. in any role they 
want us to take with the rest of the world.

IF SPARKS GETS OK TO PLAY AT MATER DEI, HIS PRESENCE WILL BE FELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Derek Sparks came to the door, and the floor rumbled beneath him. 
</P>
<P>
If Sparks' strides can make the ground shake, what kind of tremors are we in 
for if Sparks is declared eligible to play football for Mater Dei this season? 
</P>
<P>
Get the Richter scale ready. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks, a 6-foot, 212-pound all-Southern Section running back last year at Van 
Nuys Montclair Prep, enrolled at Mater Dei this week. If Sparks is ruled 
eligible to play for the Monarchs -- the Southern Section executive committee 
will meet at 11 a.m. today to discuss the situation -- Mater Dei will have a 
few additions to its football program: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A remedy for its mediocre offense. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another year of rumor and innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the latter, Mater Dei has been in this position before. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the school was placed on probation without sanctions when the 
Southern Section ruled that Mater Dei had violated a rule regarding illegal 
inducements in the transfer of Corona del Mar quarterback Dan O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
While it might be determined that Mater Dei -- and Sparks -- has acted properly 
in this case, bitter words, or at least whispers, from rival camps surely will 
hit the rumor mill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you hear? They promised Sparks cash! A car! An appearance on 'The 
Simpsons!' ... " 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei has heard it before. And so has Sparks. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old from Wharton, Tex., already has attended three high schools in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, he went to his hometown school, Wharton High. The next year he 
moved to Southern California, attending Wilmington Banning where, after gaining 
1,394 yards, he was named the state's sophomore of the year by Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>
He transferred to Montclair Prep for his junior year, gaining 1,944 yards and 
scoring 35 touchdowns last season. Two weeks ago, he played in Montclair Prep's 
season opener in Hawaii, gaining 63 yards in a 28-7 loss to Honolulu 
Farrington. He left the game in the third quarter after spraining his right 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Sparks says, he is transferring to Mater Dei because his mother, June 
Sparks, was still living in Texas but wanted to be with Derek for his senior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"She had friends in this (Santa Ana) area," Sparks said. "Plus she didn't want 
to live in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Why Mater Dei? 
</P>
<P>
"I liked Mater Dei because they stress academics so much," Derek Sparks said. 
"Once you go to a private school, you get used to everything being first-rate. 
I didn't want to sell myself short." 
</P>
<P>
Sparks did not attend classes Tuesday. He said he was waiting for his schedule 
to be finalized. Monday was the first day of classes. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if thought Mater Dei wouldn't be taking a little heat from rival programs 
if he becomes eligible, Sparks shook his head and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
"When I transferred to Montclair, there were lots of newspaper articles (with) 
quotes from the other teams," Sparks said. 
</P>
<P>
"They said stuff like, 'Yeah, he's getting paid to play,' and all that garbage. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"But no rules were ever broken. . . . One reason I didn't play last week is 
they (Mater Dei administrators) were making sure everything was OK and 
official." 
</P>
<P>
But is everything OK with Sparks? Moving three times in three years has to wear 
on you, right? 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep assistant football coach John Hazelton said Sparks sounded as if 
he was nearly in tears when he left a message on his answering machine about 
leaving Montclair. 
</P>
<P>
"When I think about it I go, 'Dang,' " Sparks said. "If I could do it all over 
again, I would've just picked one school so things could just be the same. But 
things don't always work out that way. Sometimes you just do with what comes 
your way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard, though. You have got to drop your friends and the guys on the 
football team. . . . But my mom wanted to be with me and I wanted to be with 
her. She wanted to live here, so I moved to be together." 
</P>
<P>
The gray shorts Sparks was wearing had a Mater Dei football logo stamped on 
them. His gray T-shirt had Montclair Football across the front. 
</P>
<P>
To which school does he feel more affinity? 
</P>
<P>
Only time -- and yards gained -- will tell. 
</P>
<P>
Add Sparks: Sparks, who was listed as a preseason prep All-American by 
SuperPrep magazine this year, says his goal is to break the Southern Section 
career-rushing record of 5,998 yards set in 1986-88 by Russell White of Encino 
Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
Including the 63 yards he gained in the Hawaii game two weeks ago, Sparks has a 
career total of 3,401 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He'll need a 2,598-yard season to break White's mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's going to be tough," Sparks said. "I've already missed one game, 
and I didn't get to play a full game in Hawaii . . . Also, it looks like it'll 
be more difficult because I'm moving up divisions (Mater Dei is Division I, 
Montclair Prep is Division IX). 
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenge, but I like challenges. Whatever comes, comes, though. The 
main thing is to fit in with the program." 
</P>
<P>
Or get in.

High School to a season-opening 15-14 victory over El Dorado in nonleague water 
polo Tuesday at Villa Park.

TRUSTEE FAVORS BID BY JAFFEE ON 2 NATIONAL LUMBER STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A court-appointed bankruptcy trustee overseeing the liquidation of National 
Lumber &amp; Supply Inc. recommended Tuesday that the company's two operating 
stores be sold to former company president Melvin Jaffee. 
</P>
<P>
But the landlord of one of the two stores objected to the sale to Jaffee, and a 
federal bankruptcy judge said he won't rule on the sale until he receives 
additional financial information from the three bidders for the stores. 
</P>
<P>
The stores in Encinitas and Catherdral City are all that remain of the once 
vibrant, 21-store home-improvement chain that Jaffee and his father built over 
48 years. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James N. Barr ordered National Lumber's assets liquidated 
Aug. 29. The order followed National Lumber's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
petition in early April. 
</P>
<P>
At a bankruptcy hearing in Santa Ana on Tuesday, Jaffee bid $2.5 million for 
the Cathedral City and Encinitas stores. Two competing chains also submitted 
bids to the court, with terms differing from those offered by Jaffee. 
</P>
<P>
Lumber City bid $1.2 million for the Cathedral City store, with the stipulation 
that $1.8 million in inventory remain at the store. Builders Emporium bid 
$700,000 for the lease to the Encinitas store, said Richard Marshack, a Santa 
Ana lawyer and court-appointed trustee in the liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Torrell, an attorney for Jaffee, said the owner of the Encinitas store, 
Mitsui/SBD, has raised objections to the sale to Jaffee, including whether the 
former National Lumber president has adequate financing for the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
After more than four hours of hearings and negotiations between the bidders 
Tuesday, Barr postponed any action on the sale until a hearing scheduled for 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee said that if he succeeds in buying the two stores, he will keep the 
National Lumber name but change the concept of the stores. He declined to say 
what specific changes he plans. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $2.5 million, Jaffee said he would pay $700,000 in cash and borrow $1.5 
million. In addition, Marshack said he would credit Jaffee with $300,000 in 
return for Jaffee forgiving $3.5 million in personal loans he made to National 
Lumber three months before it went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Marshack said he has been impressed by Jaffee. "He's a good guy," Marshack 
said. "He put his own money into the company when he could have kept it and 
used it later -- like now -- to buy those two stores." 
</P>
<P>
Marshack said National Lumber's chief asset is a $2-million promissory note 
from the sale of its Ontario store. Other assets include lease-backs at four 
stores, which are reportedly worth about $1 million each. 
</P>
<P>
Builders Emporium had offered to buy the former National Lumber store in South 
Gate if the Encinitas store were included, Marshack said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee announced his desire to buy the stores in court Tuesday morning. When 
the other two bidders came forward, Barr ordered the parties to leave the 
courtroom to negotiate. But the parties were unable to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
National Lumber was started by Jaffee's father, Sol, in 1942 on Woodruff Avenue 
in Bellflower.

ORANGE COUTY EARNINGS: KARCHER ENTERPRISES SEES SALES INCREASE IN 2ND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite discounting to stay competitive, Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. said 
Monday that it earned $5.1 million during its second quarter ended Aug. 13, up 
8.5% from earnings of $4.7 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim-based operator of the Carl's Jr. fast-food chain said sales for the 
quarter rose to $125 million, up 1.7% from last year's $122.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company called the figures "encouraging, considering the heavy competitive 
discounting" among fast-food chains over the summer that hurt industry profits. 
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of Karcher's fiscal year, the company earned $10.3 
million, a drop of 1% from last year's $10.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Given the improvement in second-quarter earnings, the company said it expects 
to show stronger year-end earnings for 1990 than it did in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sales for the first six months rose 3.8%, to $282.1 million from $271.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Sales increased this year despite Karcher's selling or franchising 40 
company-owned restaurants in Arizona, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher owns, franchises or licenses 554 restaurants in the western United 
States and Japan.

UNISYS CORP.'S TIMEPLEX WILL BUY OUT DOELZ 
</P>

<P>
To boost its technological prowess in creating high-speed data transfer 
networks, Timeplex, a subsidiary of computer maker Unisys Corp., said Tuesday 
that it has agreed to acquire the assets of Doelz Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal, which is subject to approval of shareholders of Irvine-based 
Doelz, were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Doelz, which employs 60 workers, will be integrated into Timeplex, a 
manufacturer of high-speed data communications network equipment based in 
Woodcliff Lake, N.J. Company officials said no layoffs are expected. 
</P>
<P>
Doelz produces so-called wide-area networks that allow computers and other 
office equipment to communicate over telephone lines between distant sites. 
</P>
<P>
Timeplex, which has sales in excess of $200 million, said in a statement that 
it will support Doelz's current line of packet-switching products. The switches 
can burst packets of data over a communications network quickly and 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies have had a relationship since 1987, when Timeplex was 
acquired by Unisys. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last two to three years, approximately 60% of Doelz's current 
production has been distributed by Unisys," said Dewaine L. Osman, president of 
Timeplex and the Unisys Communications &amp; Networks group. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Doelz said the sale would enable the company to better explore new 
technologies. "To some extent you like to run your own show, but on the other 
hand Timeplex has a lot more resources to do more interesting things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The engineering portion of Doelz will remain in Irvine and be known as the 
Doelz Technical Center. Doelz, 71, will be Timeplex's chief scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Doelz founded the company in 1979 and 10 years later led a group of European 
investors in a buyout of the firm -- then known as Doelz Networks Inc. -- for 
an undisclosed sum. At the time, Doelz officials said revenues were in the 
$10-million to $20-million range.

COMING OUT IS A BALL; 
</P>
<P>
YOUNG LADIES OF CHINESE HERITAGE TO TAKE THEIR TURN AS DEBUTANTES 
</P>

<P>
At first glance, the 22 girls, resembling swan-like fairy princesses under the 
bright photo studio lights, did not seem like trailblazers in the demure world 
of debutanting. 
</P>
<P>
They were stereotypically deb down to every ruffle and bow in their billowy 
white gowns, no different from all the other girls who have prepared for this 
"coming out" rite of high society from New York and Philadelphia to Los Angeles 
and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
And, as they posed for Morgan Studio photographer Arone Long for their first 
group portrait -- their Dec. 29 "Winter Blossom Ball" still months away -- they 
acted as thrilled and properly awed as any debs-in-training before the big 
event. 
</P>
<P>
But these 22 girls from some of Southern California's posher neighborhoods, and 
whose fathers range from doctors and engineers to corporate moguls, are not 
your typical American debs. 
</P>
<P>
These girls are all of Chinese descent. And their parents, immigrants from 
China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, have organized their own 
Chinese-American Debutante Guild, the first such all-Chinese group in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The unusualness, even oddity, of such a move -- especially for an 
ethnic-minority group that had never been associated with this still highly 
popular social ritual in America -- is not lost on these Chinese-American girls 
from Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Murmured one of them, as she was re-fluffing her gown during a break in their 
recent portrait sitting: "To me, it always seemed strictly for white girls. You 
know, a Scarlett O'Hara or a Grace Kelly. But not us." 
</P>
<P>
An Asian-American-sponsored debutante ball is still something of a novelty. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-'60s, the Japan America Society of Southern California, a cultural 
affairs organization, did stage an annual ball that included whites but was 
predominately for girls of Japanese descent. 
</P>
<P>
But this Los Angeles "Cherry Blossom Ball" was discontinued in 1968 because, a 
Japan America Society organizer explained, of the nationwide decline in the 
popularity of debutante balls during the anti-establishment '60s. 
</P>
<P>
The newly formed Chinese-American Debutante Guild is considered the first such 
Asian-ancestry sponsor in Southern California since the '60s, representatives 
in the Asian-American communities said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Chinese-American organizers like to assert that their effort is in 
no way an ethnic-minority challenge to the traditional, white-dominated 
debutante circuit. 
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that some Asian-American girls have made their debuts at balls 
on the traditional circuit with such long-established charitable presenters as 
Las Campanas, Les Amis des Femmes and the Children's Home Society's Newport 
Beach auxiliary. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Chinese-Americans like to depict their new guild as just one more 
effort to celebrate their own ethnic heritage and pass on ethnic success models 
to their otherwise American-born, American-raised children. 
</P>
<P>
These are much the same arguments used by the African-American community groups 
-- including Links, a professional women's organization -- which have sponsored 
their own debutante balls in Los Angeles and Orange counties for years. 
</P>
<P>
"We see nothing wrong with forming our own (debutante) group. People with the 
same backgrounds, the same values, feel more comfortable with each other," 
explained May Hsu of Tustin, co-chairwoman of the Chinese-American guild. 
</P>
<P>
However, guild organizers said they are concerned that some Americans -- 
especially those critical of the proliferation of Asian-language signs and 
Asian commercial strips in Los Angeles and Orange counties -- might perceive 
their all-Chinese guild as racially separatist. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no, this is not so," said Ruth Ding of Newport Beach, long a key figure in 
local Chinese-American cultural programs. "Our children are already so 
Americanized. How can one small (all-Chinese) group like ours hurt." 
</P>
<P>
"And, really, our program isn't so very different," Ding added. "We, too, want 
the opportunity to honor our outstanding young women in this very special way." 
</P>
<P>
For these guild members -- affluent families living in prestigious areas 
outside the Chinese enclaves -- now find themselves turning their attention to 
yet another status symbol of the upwardly mobile in America. 
</P>
<P>
They have discovered debutanteland. 
</P>
<P>
To many, debutanting has always meant dazzling but rather shallow displays of 
conspicuous high society, when America's social elite staged its whirlwind 
rounds of mammoth "coming out" parties. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, the more serious debutante-sponsor groups have tried to live down 
the grandiose images. For years now, these groups have tied their events 
closely to charitable causes -- using the balls as fund-raisers and also 
recruiting the girls for community-service projects . 
</P>
<P>
But the central vision of any debutante program is still this hallowed rite of 
passage: the night of the debut extravaganza where the girls are formally 
introduced to society. 
</P>
<P>
Consider again the Chinese-American Debutante Guild-selected girls, ages 17 to 
21. They are viewed as high-achiever students in various universities -- the 
schools include Yale, Wellesley and UC Berkeley and Irvine -- as well as being 
from socially prominent families in the Chinese immigrant community. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the fathers are in the business and professional fields, there 
is one diplomat in the group: C.Y. Chang, Los Angeles director-general of 
Taiwan's Coordinating Council for North American Affairs. His deb daughter, 
Grace, is studying at Northwestern University. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their deb apprenticeship, these girls have attended classes on the 
American social graces for young ladies -- etiquette, poise, proper attire, 
social dancing -- and on choosing careers. They have gone to numerous informal 
parties at homes hosted by guild parents. 
</P>
<P>
And the main event, the "Winter Blossom Ball" Dec. 29 at the Disneyland Hotel, 
will feature much of the flourishes and speeches associated with such balls, 
including the classic moment when each girl is announced and escorted down the 
center of the ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exciting program and a lot of fun. It's real neat. All of us feel 
proud and lucky at being chosen," said Emily Liu, 17, of Palos Verdes, who is 
entering the University of Notre Dame this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The girls also lauded the charitable side of today's debutanting. "I think 
that's great because it gives depth to the program and the image," said Joni 
Lee, 18, of Huntington Beach, a student at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The organizers pointed out that their guild was created as a fund-raising arm 
for a proposed Orange County-based senior citizens center program for the 
Chinese-American community. 
</P>
<P>
The center project, still in the study stage, was launched last year with 
$10,000 "seed money" from three organizations: Chinese-American Lions Club of 
Orange County, Orange County Chinese Cultural Club and Pan Pacific Performing 
Arts Inc. 
</P>
<P>
According to project president Nelson Mar of Irvine, the proposed center will 
chiefly be an informational and referral facility. Eventually, he added, the 
center will join other Asian-American organizations in expanding housing, 
health and recreation programs for seniors, particularly immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
This community activism extends to each of the 22 guild debutantes. The girls 
are required to serve at least 100 hours in a community-service program. Some 
of the girls have already done extensive volunteer work, such as in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as Christina Sun, 19, of Palos Verdes, have been involved in 
Chinese community projects. A student at UCLA, Sun has been tutoring immigrant 
children in English and other subjects at an elementary school in Los Angeles' 
Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all this community activism, one historic mission of debutanting 
cannot be underestimated, even in the '90s -- that is, these groups as social 
catalyst and social arbiter. 
</P>
<P>
For the debs, this means making the proper connections not only for careers but 
also for marriage. 
</P>
<P>
This is no small matter for those in the Chinese immigrant group. They worry 
that their children, depicted as already too Americanized, are not making 
enough contact with other Chinese. They fear that their great hope -- that 
their children will marry other Chinese -- may be dashed. 
</P>
<P>
The debs in the Chinese-American guild are a typical case. Nearly all were 
raised in predominantly white American areas and went to elementary and high 
schools there. And, unless they attended Chinese churches or Chinese language 
schools, they seldom went to all-Chinese gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some of the older girls were already mostly dating white or other 
non-Chinese males. 
</P>
<P>
So the parents, when forming their debutante guild, saw a golden opportunity in 
social arrangements: a program where nice Chinese girls can meet nice Chinese 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
The parents saw to it that the male partners at the debs' parties and social 
dancing classes were all young Chinese-Americans from the same coterie of 
immigrant families. 
</P>
<P>
Tilting the ethnic scale even more, the parents have made it an official policy 
that the male escorts to the Dec. 29 ball must be of Chinese descent. 
</P>
<P>
And when one of the girls told the guild committee that she wanted her white 
boyfriend to be her escort, her request was flatly turned down. 
</P>
<P>
This deb, Sansan Kwan, 19, of Rancho Palos Verdes, said she is still not happy 
with the committee's decision. "But I can live with it. It's one of those 
things. I mean, all of us already know the feelings of our parents on this 
issue," said Kwan, a student at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she added, "this (guild) program is overall a very good one. I still 
feel very honored at being part of it." 
</P>
<P>
The other debs, too, seem to be taking their parents' ethnic arrangements in 
stride. 
</P>
<P>
"These (all-Chinese parties) are a lot of fun. I like the idea of meeting other 
Chinese. And I think all of us are becoming more aware of our Chinese identity 
as we get older," said UCLA student Rosalie Chin, 20, of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
But Yale student Stacie Cheng, 18, of Los Angeles added: "We also realize we're 
a bicultural generation, and I think we have learned to be comfortable with 
that. Socially, I don't think it (ethnic background) matters as much to us, one 
way or another." 
</P>
<P>
So on the marriage issue, the feelings of these debs may be summed up this way: 
no matter whom they marry -- Chinese or non-Chinese -- the choice will be up to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Their parents seem to agree. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we can't push it (dating and marrying a Chinese)," said guild 
co-chairwoman May Hsu. "We're in America, and you can't do that, can you?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet, with the guild's specially prepared girl-meets-boy encounters in mind, Hsu 
added: "But we can try and provide the right opportunities for them. We can 
suggest -- and hope for the best."

DISCOVERY: NEWPORT HOLOGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Set among Lido Marina Village's covey of sailboat shops, restaurants and 
clothing stores, Southern California's only hologram gallery might be mistaken 
for an optical illusion. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Holograms, with its three-dimensional watches winking enticingly from 
behind the display windows, catches the curious eye. But once inside the dark 
shop, one may become uneasy. Walls lined with 3-D laser reproductions pulse 
with an eerie greenish glow. Under closer inspection, the ghostly images appear 
to reach out from their frames and into space. 
</P>
<P>
What type of retailer would surround himself with these all-too-lifelike 
portraits of skeletons, lions' heads and Hollywood glamour queens? 
</P>
<P>
David Schaffner, owner of Newport Holograms, sits quietly at his desk across 
from a three-dimensional portrait of a look-alike Marilyn Monroe, who silently 
blows kisses at passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, a hologram is a good image without any sound," he said. 
"Holograms are my love, my life, my work." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, holograms have been his obsession. 
</P>
<P>
While visiting a relative in Dallas, Schaffner discovered holography at a store 
in the area. "On our way downtown, I wondered what the big deal was. I mean, 
that we'd drive all the way into town to see these hologram things," he said. 
"But they blew me away. I saw opening a gallery as an opportunity to be in on 
the cutting edge of a new art form." 
</P>
<P>
Instinct, and good sense, led Schaffner to open his doors in well-heeled, 
upbeat Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here, both tourists and locals, enjoy being in on what's new and 
different," he said. "My goal is to give the physical nature of the gallery 
enough versatility to provide optimum creativity in displaying the pieces." 
</P>
<P>
The word "hologram" derives from the Greek holos and gramma, meaning "total 
drawing." A hologram is actually a glass plate coated with a high-resolution, 
light-sensitive emulsion. A single laser beam travels along low-frequency 
tables toward an object, passes through a lens and splits into two beams. One 
beam establishes a light reference on the plate, the other beam records the 
image. Illumination of the hologram lends the illusion its three-dimensional 
fullness and depth. 
</P>
<P>
The process is expensive, however. Master plates can cost as much as $10,000 to 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
While purchasing a hologram may be cost-prohibitive for most, the shop also 
carries other hi-tech visuals, such as laser discs and 3-D jewelry. Pieces at 
the shop retail for as little as $15 and go as high as $15,000 (both prices 
include frames and lighting). 
</P>
<P>
Costs aside, it is the novelty of the items that brings people into the shop. 
</P>
<P>
"(With) holograms, as with all optical illusions, seeing is believing," 
Schaffner said.

ARTS COUNCIL GIVES GROUPS FUND BOOST;

<P>
GRANTS: THE GARDEN GROVE SYMPHONY AND NEWPORT HARBOR ART MUSEUM EACH RECEIVED 
MORE MONEY THAN AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE HAD RECOMMENDED.

<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum and Garden Grove Symphony came away winners 
Tuesday when the California Arts Council overruled its own advisory panel and 
granted both institutions more money than had been recommended for them. 
</P>
<P>
The panel would have reduced the museum's grant from almost $60,000 last year 
to less than $10,000 and placed it on a sort of funding probation because it 
continues to operate without a director and chief curator. But the council 
rejected the plan, raised the museum's rankings, which are based on artistic, 
administrative and outreach strength, and voted to award it nearly $19,000 this 
year, according to council spokeswoman Joanne Anglin. 
</P>
<P>
The council also raised the Garden Grove Symphony's ranking, qualifying it for 
the minimum state grant of $1,000, Anglin said. It is the orchestra's first CAC 
grant. Advisory panel members had characterized the group's quality as "very 
poor" and charged that its programs "bordered on a pops flavor." 
</P>
<P>
Anglin said council member Harvey Stearn of Irvine, who asked the council to 
raise the rankings of both the museum and the orchestra, argued that panelists 
had "given undue weight" to the museum's lack of a director and chief curator 
in making their evaluation. The institution has been without either staff 
member for months. 
</P>
<P>
Stearn "felt that panelists could not assume that there would be negative 
consequences to museum programs as a result of this," Anglin said. 
</P>
<P>
While the museum will still receive far less state money than it got last year, 
board president Thomas H. Nielsen welcomed the reconsideration: "We are 
grateful to the council members for their careful review of the museum's 
current operating conditions and past accomplishments, as well as our proposed 
outreach programs," he said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Symphony general manager Yaakov Dvir-Djerassi, who lobbied for the 
orchestra at the council's meeting Tuesday in Sacramento, helped persuade the 
council that its service to the city's large Korean community merited state 
support, Anglin said. 
</P>
<P>
"The council felt like there was a sense of meeting the needs of that 
particular community and that (the orchestra) shouldn't be cut out altogether," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dvir-Djerassi said by phone after the meeting that the victory was the 
orchestra's way of making a statement. "The monetary thing was secondary," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen other Orange County groups were awarded a total of $262,363 in council 
grants, ranging from $96,278 for South Coast Repertory to $1,000 each for four 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum and Garden Grove Symphony were the only 
organizations statewide to receive more money after council reconsideration of 
panel recommendations.

PROTESTERS TRY TO HALT DEPARTURE OF RECHRISTENED EXXON VALDEZ

Protesters in inflatable boats surrounded the former Exxon Valdez before dawn 
today, climbing her sides to unfurl a banner and chaining themselves to her 
rudder. Nine protesters were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Police using bolt cutters freed two protesters from the environmental 
activist group Greenpeace who had chained themselves to the tanker's rudder 
about 20 feet above the water. The pair, along with a third protester 
attempting to hang a banner from the rudder, were arrested, Sgt. David Rohowits 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Police Chief Arthur LeBlanc said nine people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Les Rogers in Houston said Greenpeace protesters in motorized 
inflatable boats pulled up to the stern of the tanker about 4:30 a.m. as the 
giant ship was preparing to get under way for the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, renamed the Exxon Mediterranean in July at the end of an 
unprecedented refitting, caused the worst oil spill in American history in 
Alaska's Prince William Sound in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Quirke, a Greenpeace spokesman, said four people, including one who fell 
and hurt his arm, climbed the side of the ship to hang a banner that read "Sane 
Energy: When?" 
</P>
<P>
Protesters also floated an oil boom and a 20-foot inflatable globe about the 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to blockade the Valdez to call attention to the fact it represents a 
battleship in the war on the environment," Quirke said. "It has put us in the 
precarious position of being on the brink of war in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
Once the protest was over, a blanket of fog rolled in and the tanker's 
departure was put on hold.

IRAN'S AYATOLLAH CALLS FIGHT WITH U.S. 'HOLY WAR' 
</P>

<P>
Iran's spiritual leader today called the struggle against the United States a 
"holy war" and said Muslims who die fighting the U.S. presence in the region 
will go to heaven as martyrs. 
</P>
<P>
The call by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei came a day after Tehran reportedly agreed to 
give Iraq food and medicine in exchange for oil and cash. 
</P>
<P>
Such a deal could puncture the U.N. embargo that aims to force Iraq out of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's pronouncement also came two days after Iran said it plans to renew 
full diplomatic relations with Iraq, which is seeking to break the isolation 
imposed on it since it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Tehran Radio, Khamenei said: "Muslim nations will not allow America 
to set up its security and defense system in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"The struggle against American aggression, greed, plans and policies in the 
Persian Gulf will be counted as jihad (holy war), and anybody who is killed on 
that path is a martyr," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 Americans and Britons who had been stranded in Kuwait, meanwhile, 
took off today from Baghdad, ending a six-week ordeal. Their Boeing 747 was 
chartered jointly by the United States and Britain.

BUSH 'FORTHRIGHT' IN MESSAGE TO IRAQIS;

GULF CRISIS: THE PRESIDENT DECLARES HE HAS NO QUARREL WITH THE PEOPLE, SAYING 
THE FAULT LIES WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN.

President Bush today taped a "very forthright" message to the Iraqi people, 
saying that he has no quarrel with them and that their suffering is the fault 
of their president, Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The White House urged Baghdad to air the eight-minute tape within five days, 
saying the television message will be released around the world after that. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that if Iraqi officials censor or 
edit the message, "it'll be clear to the world what they were not willing to 
let their people see." 
</P>
<P>
Bush stood in front of his desk in the Oval Office for the 7:30 a.m. taping, 
fewer than 12 hours after a speech to Congress and the nation in which he 
prepared the American people for a long and possibly painful U.S. commitment in 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
His media adviser, Sig Rogich, said, "I'm very pleased with (the tape). He was 
very forthright." 
</P>
<P>
Rogich declined to release a copy of the tape or its text. But Fitzwater said 
Bush reiterated his statement that the United States has no quarrel with the 
Iraqi people and that their suffering is due to Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said on the tape that "we want a peaceful resolution; we want peaceful 
coexistence with the people of Iraq," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, asked if Bush used harsh rhetoric against Hussein, described the 
message as "personal and . . . directed toward the people of Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the tape will be delivered to the Iraqi ambassador later today 
by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger. The White House will then 
give the Iraqi government five days to broadcast the tape before releasing it 
to the world, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Rogich said that he was putting Arabic subtitles on the tape and that a 
simultaneous audio translation was being added. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made the tape following an announcement by the Iraqi government last week 
that it would broadcast a message to the Iraqi people from Bush, and an offer 
to send a television crew to interview him. 
</P>
<P>
The President chose to make his own videotape rather than submit to an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that Bush worked on the message with officials from the State 
Department and National Security Council and that he also consulted with 
experts on the Arab world.

2 COMPTON MEN SENTENCED IN HOLDUP OF 22 AT VAN NUYS BAR

<P>
Two men were sentenced to lengthy prison terms today for their roles in a 
holdup in which 22 patrons at a Van Nuys bar were robbed and held hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Judith Meisels Ashmann sentenced Otis Tooks, 31, 
of Compton to 35 years in prison, and Arthur Taylor, 24, also of Compton, to 24 
years for the March 14 robbery at the Nice 'N' Easy Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Tooks received the maximum term and Taylor somewhat less for the crimes, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Dver, who prosecuted them. Dver said Tooks received 
the longer sentence because of prior criminal convictions. 
</P>
<P>
A jury last month deliberated less than a day before finding the two men and 
another man, Albert G. Sutton, guilty of 14 counts of robbery in the holdup. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing for Sutton, 24, of San Dimas was postponed until Oct. 10 because his 
attorney was ill. 
</P>
<P>
The three men, armed with semiautomatic handguns and rifles, entered the bar at 
7214 Sepulveda Blvd. about 7:30 p.m. They herded the bar's employees and 
customers onto the dance floor, Dver said. 
</P>
<P>
While Tooks held the patrons at gunpoint and Sutton kept a lookout, Taylor 
ordered everyone to turn over their money and jewelry, threatening some victims 
with their lives, Dver said. One patron managed to sneak out and call police, 
who surrounded the bar, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
The three men were apprehended as they tried to flee through a roof exit, 
dropping money and jewelry as they went, Dver added.

Forty-nine blacks and a white policeman were killed in some of the most vicious 
factional fighting since violence erupted in townships around Johannesburg a 
month ago, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
A predawn bombing damaged the offices of the governing National Party but 
caused no injuries, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths occurred overnight and early today in the townships ringing 
Johannesburg, where battles between rival black groups have claimed about 700 
lives in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
Worst hit was Tembisa, northeast of Johannesburg, where 25 bodies were found, 
police said. Also, 13 people were killed in Vosloorus, seven in Tokhoza and one 
in Katlehong -- all townships southeast of Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
The policeman was killed and three colleagues seriously wounded when they were 
ambushed with assault rifles while driving through a squatter camp in the 
Soweto township. 
</P>
<P>
Also in Soweto, three blacks were killed when their yellow van was riddled with 
gunfire from AK-47 rifles. The attackers apparently mistook the van for a 
police vehicle, most of which are yellow.

Max Hedglin is anything but a wallflower when it comes to expressing his 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
He hired a helicopter to drop 2,500 carnations and 10,000 love letters on the 
lawn of his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Hedglin, 38, who owns a convenience store in nearby 
Greenville, the $3,000 tribute on Saturday failed to take root with Bonnie 
Adams. But then, a week earlier she had married City Councilman Mike Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities charged Hedglin with littering. On Tuesday, he pulled up outside 
the Police Department in a stretch limo and paid a $237 bond.

The thrill-seeking sport of bungee jumping was banned today pending review of 
an accident that injured a former Miss Australia and an experienced jumper. 
</P>
<P>
Natalie McCurry, whose reign as Miss Australia ended Monday, suffered a broken 
collarbone when a cord came free as she and a staff member of the Bungee Bats 
group plunged 130 feet. 
</P>
<P>
McCurry and Andy Gulby took a tandem leap from a cage suspended by a crane off 
Sydney's Birkenhead Point. 
</P>
<P>
They had their arms wrapped around each other, and elastic cords attached to 
their ankles were supposed to stop their fall a couple of yards above the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the cords broke free from the cage, leaving only the other to 
support the couple's combined weight. 
</P>
<P>
They hit the water and went under before the remaining cord stretched back. 
Then they dangled upside down for several minutes with their heads just above 
the surface.

Japan has set up a study panel to seek ways to encourage private sector 
investment in Third World nations, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The panel's study will help complement Japan's drive to recyle its huge trade 
surplus into developing nations," a Finance Ministry official told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said the panel is scheduled to come up with recommendations 
to the government in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
They said Japan needs to find measures to help redirect the flow of Japanese 
capital because most private-sector funds have so far flowed to industrial 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
Of Japan's $67.54 billion in direct investment abroad in the last fiscal year, 
48.2% went to the United States and 20.8% went to nations in the European 
Community.

Summer box office receipts for Cineplex Odeon Corp., one of North America's 
biggest movie theater chains, are not as strong as the money-losing company 
hoped, President and Chief Executive Officer Allen Karp said today. 
</P>
<P>
But he still expects Cineplex's earnings for the peak movie-going summer season 
to be higher than in 1989, in contrast to the rest of the industry, which he 
believes will earn less. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough summer," Karp said in an interview. "But we had a couple of 
advantages going for us." He mentioned Cineplex's performance in Canada and its 
conservative bidding that helped it avoid some highly touted films that did 
poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex, which loaded itself with debt because of over-ambitious expansion 
plans, lost $50.4 million in the first half of 1990.

EXXON CALLS ALASKA CLEANUP A SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
OIL SPILL: DESPITE SOME CRUDE REMAINING ON ONCE-PRISTINE BEACHES, ITS CREWS ARE 
GOING HOME.

<P>
Exxon today declared its Alaska oil spill cleanup a success and said it is 
demobilizing the cleanup crew after a second summer of work, despite some crude 
oil remaining in the once-pristine environment. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, the shorelines look good," Exxon cleanup manager Otto Harrison 
said Tuesday night at the final cleanup operations meeting of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"That does not mean that all the oil is gone or that every bit of shoreline 
looks good," Harrison said, predicting that winter storms will pick up where 
Exxon left off, leaving oiled beaches in better shape when Exxon returns next 
spring to survey the condition of the shores. 
</P>
<P>
Some work crews were taken off beaches today and all others were to be finished 
for the year by Friday. Harrison said Exxon will leave a skeleton staff in 
Alaska over the winter and the company will reopen its Alaska cleanup office 
next April. 
</P>
<P>
A standing-room-only crowd packed a city auditorium to hear Exxon's last formal 
pronouncements about the summer cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
State officials reserved comment and let Exxon have the spotlight during the 
meeting. Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper scheduled his own news conference for today, 
but commented that "there's still a lot to do." 
</P>
<P>
The tanker Exxon Valdez hit a charted reef in March, 1989, and broke open, 
spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound and the Gulf 
of Alaska, coating 1,200 miles of shore with crude, ruining fishing and killing 
tens of thousands of sea birds, eagles, otters and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
The spill was the worst in American history and triggered the greatest cleanup 
mobilization ever mounted for an oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that could have been done in a sound environmental manner has been 
done," Harrison said. "Fishing, tourism and biological restoration have been 
good in 1990. Debris has been picked up. Tar mats have been removed." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison noted that fishermen this summer caught a record number of salmon in 
Prince William Sound. He noted that tourists returned and he said no animals 
were killed by oil this summer. 
</P>
<P>
However, Harrison acknowledged that, 18 months after the spill, some beaches 
look worse because Exxon pulled apart storm berms above the high tide line in 
order to expose buried oil.

Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world widened 3.7% in August while 
its surplus with the United States narrowed, the Finance Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
The overall surplus grew to an unadjusted $3.49 billion in August from $3.37 
billion in August, 1989, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time this year that the nation's trade gap has widened 
compared with a year earlier. The surplus had declined for 11 consecutive 
months until March. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus with the United States narrowed to $2.83 billion from 
$3.01 billion in August last year. 
</P>
<P>
The surplus with the United States shrank because of lower demand for Japanese 
exports resulting from a slowing U.S. economy, economists said.

A federal court has dismissed a multimillion-dollar antitrust lawsuit filed by 
a bowling ball manufacturer against the Professional Bowlers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed in 1988 by EurekaUrethane Inc. of St. Louis after the PBA 
did not clear for use in its tournaments a bowling ball the firm produced that 
carried a beer company's product name and logo. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling last week, Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh said the PBA's actions in 
refusing to sanction the ball were "neither unreasonable nor anti-competitive" 
and were "a sound exercise of business judgment calculated to preserve their 
ability to serve the interests of professional bowlers."

When he made a surprise training ride with the alternate U.S. two-man bobsled 
team at the Calgary Olympics in 1988, Willie Gault said he was satisfied with 
his performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my push times proved I deserve to be here," said Gault, then of the 
Chicago Bears and now a wide receiver with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Gault didn't end up pushing a U.S. sled in competition at Calgary, but Tuesday 
he again proved he deserves future consideration for a spot on the Olympic 
team. He teamed with former Olympic track and field champion Edwin Moses and 
Bubba Womack of Brunswick, Ga., to set a track record in the three-man push 
competition at the National Push Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The trio posted a record time of 5.18 seconds on one run and won the three-heat 
competition with an overall clocking of 15.68 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
American bobsledders have been shut out of Olympic gold since 1956, but Gault 
and more than 50 other athletes who turned out here for the weeklong 
competition are giving bobsled officials renewed hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've seen in the first two days of competition has been unbelievable," 
said David Helm, executive director of the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton 
Federation. "We knew we had some great athletes coming in, but we never 
imagined we would see times like these." 
</P>
<P>
Gault created something of a furor when he joined the bobsled team after the 
Bears' NFL season ended early in 1988. Several sledders believed that he hadn't 
put in enough time to go to the Olympics, especially after he replaced longtime 
competitor Don LaVigne, who later was reinstated on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Herschel Walker of the Minnesota Vikings failed to appear Monday, 
but bobsled officials said Walker was trying to work out an arrangement where 
he will be able to compete at a later date. They said they were hopeful he 
might be able to compete within the next week. 
</P>
<P>
Gault, Walker and Moses underwent a series of tests here in mid-July designed 
to gauge their strength and running abilities needed to compete in world-class 
bobsled events. And they were impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Gault finished first and came within seven points of tying the record for the 
U.S. Bobsled Federation's qualifying tests. He scored 802 points in a test that 
included 30-, 60- and 100-meter sprints, the shot put, and vertical and long 
jumps. 
</P>
<P>
Although both Walker and Gault have their obligations to football, they remain 
resolute in staying in contention for the 1992 Winter Games at Albertville, 
France. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever commitment we have to make, we're going to do them," Gault said. 
"Whatever the rules are, we're going to abide by the rules." 
</P>
<P>
"As I get more and more experience with it, I'm going to feel more comfortable 
with it," said Walker, who suffered a minor injury in the Vikings' 
season-opener on Sunday. "Experience plays a big part in this sport. You have 
to know what you're doing."

LAWRENCE TAYLOR WINS NFC DEFENSIVE HONORS

<P>
Lawrence Taylor, who reported to the New York Giants just four days before last 
Sunday's game with the Philadelphia Eagles, today was named the NFC Defensive 
Player of the Week. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Dilweg of Green Bay, David Fulcher of Cincinnati and Sammie Smith of 
Miami also earned the NFL's first-week honors. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who held out for 55 days, had seven tackles, including three sacks, and 
forced a fumble in New York's 27-20 win over Philadelphia, its first over the 
Eagles after four straight losses. It was the fourth time since 1988 that 
Taylor has won NFC defensive honors. 
</P>
<P>
Dilweg, making his first start at quarterback for Green Bay in place of Don 
Majkowski, who held out until late last week, won NFC offensive honors. He 
completed 20 of 32 passes for 248 yards and three touchdowns in a 36-24 win 
over the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Fulcher was named AFC Defensive Player of the Week. He tackled Ken O'Brien for 
a safety, then intercepted his final pass in the Bengals' 25-20 win over the 
New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, the AFC Offensive Player of the Week, rushed for 159 yards on 23 carries 
and scored twice as Miami beat New England, 27-24. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Delton Hall, who started Sunday's season opener, 
has been placed on the injured reserve list because of a partially torn tendon 
in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, linebacker Greg Lloyd was admitted today to a hospital with the 
stomach flu. It is not known how long he will be sidelined, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Eric Williams joined the Washington Redskins today with parting 
shots at the Lions organization that traded him after six years in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"They're definitely not a class organization at all" Williams said after 
passing a physical examination for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Williams ended a holdout with Detroit only last week and was traded to the 
Redskins on Tuesday for veteran running back James Wilder and a fourth-round 
draft choice.

Reports already filtering in tell us that Raiders fans in Northern California 
have taken Tuesday's twist of fate in the typically understated style 
characteristic of the Silver and Black. They're burning their T-shirts, 
shredding their pennants and going at their pirate tattoos with 50-grit 
sandpaper. Better a scar than a grinning reminder that you-know-who has 
betrayed them again. There's talk some may even bathe. 
</P>
<P>
Listen, except that nothing befits a Raiders fan like overreaction, the current 
wailing and gnashing of fangs is altogether premature.

Yes, we know you wanted the Raiders back in Oakland last week. Yes, we know you 
have suffered nine long years, and now that Al Davis and Spectacor have cozied 
up, it's going to be harder than ever to keep the embers of Raidermania 
glowing. Well, who can blame you, if all you can envision is the 20-year 
Davis-Spectacor-L.A. Coliseum partnership announced Tuesday? 
</P>
<P>
But you shouldn't go cutting your Electra-glides into metal confetti yet. 
Despite the hoopla and smiling faces, despite Davis' contention that they'd 
settled a situation akin to the Middle East -- a crisis a day, the owner termed 
it -- and now they could get on with more important stuff, like winning the AFC 
West, despite the crestfallen looks in Oakland City Hall, all Davis really said 
Tuesday was, "If." 
</P>
<P>
If an environmental impact study allows renovation of the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If private financing can be found to pay for the $145-million renovation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If historical preservationists can be persuaded that reconfiguration (including 
addition of luxury boxes) of the 67-year-old stadium is not tantamount to 
painting Mount Vernon fuchsia. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And if special interest groups can be persuaded not to file lawsuits at every 
turn. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Then the NFL will retain the geography of the 1980s, the Raiders will continue 
to recruit Raiderettes from Hollywood casting lines, and Spectacor will have 
done more than simply persuade Davis to fulfill his original lease agreement in 
Los Angeles. Otherwise, Oakland -- and, indeed, even Sacramento -- could be 
going through this whole tap dance again in less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Two years. That's how long Spectacor has to work out the details of the 
agreement Davis signed. Gregg Lukenbill, the Sacramento Kings' owner and 
would-be football impresario, has jumped through enough bureaucratic hoops 
trying to do for Sacramento almost exactly what Spectacor wants to do for Los 
Angeles to wonder if 24 months is enough time to get it done. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the renovation itself. Start to finish, it's a three-year job, 
minimum, Sacramento's stadium builder says. More likely, it's a four- to 
six-year project. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot can go wrong in four to six years," Lukenbill says. "A lot can go wrong 
in four to six days." 
</P>
<P>
Lukenbill comes by his skepticism honestly. Besides regularly duking it out 
with City Hall, he has also gone 15 rounds with Davis. For now, Lukenbill 
ruminates. 
</P>
<P>
But if there are more plain old sports fans in the Big Valley than there are 
unquenchable Raiders fans -- a fairly safe assumption -- then Tuesday could be 
considered a great day for Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
First, because a second NFL team in Northern California would have presented 
the same brand of geographical prejudice that hounds Sacramento's bid for 
major-league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Second, because while 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo could not have blocked the 
Raiders' return to Oakland -- the Raiders won the right of franchise movement 
in court in 1984 -- he will lobby against a new Bay Area team from his position 
on the NFL's Committee on Expansion. Meanwhile, DeBartolo has said he has no 
opposition to the NFL setting up a shop in Sacramento. But he also has said 
Sacramento's best route to the NFL would be through luring an existing 
franchise. The teams usually mentioned are New England, where shaver magnate 
Victor Kiam has a running battle with the owners of Foxboro Stadium, and Tampa 
Bay, where the cantankerous Hugh Culverhouse Sr. has been quiet since local 
burghers began talking sweetly about a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if in two years Spectacor has not knotted all the loose ends, the 
Raiders might be on the prowl again. By that time, the Acro Park stadium ought 
to be a reality, reducing Davis' previous reservations about Sacramento to your 
basic zip-a-dee-doo-dah. Besides, two years is long enough to forget what an 
awful aftertaste remained the last time we swallowed Al's vague proposals, 
leaving only the memory of what a good idea it was. 
</P>
<P>
The same point of view should hold for Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
When this back-to-Oakland stuff heated up three years ago, I wrote that Davis 
had too much invested in Los Angeles ever to leave. To prove the courage of my 
conviction, I offered that anyone holding an original copy of that column 
could, on the day Raiders moving vans crossed the Alameda County line, smack me 
in the face with a cream pie. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, as a Raiders return seemed increasingly imminent, it has come to my 
attention that more than a delighted few of you had preserved that column in 
some special place. Lest you add that piece of columnist bravado to your 
Raiders pyre, wait. Nobody's saying I-told-you-so yet. Not with so many 
bureaucrats, bank presidents and activists to satisfy. 
</P>
<P>
This still has a ways to go.

The 52nd season of racing at the Los Angeles County Fair commences Thursday 
afternoon at Fairplex Park in Pomona with a 13-race card. The first post is at 
12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Included on the opening-day offering is one appaloosa event, three for quarter 
horses and nine thoroughbred races. 
</P>
<P>
The Pick Six commences with the fifth race, the first of the thoroughbred 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Two daily doubles will be offered daily through the 19-day meet, which runs 
through Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Races 5 and 6 will be the early double, with the day's final two races the late 
double. A triple, on races 9 through 11, will be offered daily. 
</P>
<P>
There will be $5 exacta wagering on all races except the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The day's most lucrative event is the $50,000-added Foothill Stakes, which will 
be the 12th race on the card. The 6 1/2-furlong dash lured a full field of 10 
and offers a purse of $50,000-added. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's tri-champion jockeys at Fairplex Park -- Corey Black, David Flores 
and Martin Pedroza -- are set to ride in the Foothill. Black is aboard Cove 
Way, Flores will ride Pass the Blame and Pedroza is on Candyman Bee. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup, in post position order with jockeys and weights: Due to the King, 
Julio Garcia, 122 pounds; Sharp Event, Ray Sibille, 114; Gate Flyer, Paul 
Nicolo, 114; Gundaghia, Corey Nakatani, 122; Devine Force, Frank Olivares, 114; 
Candyman Bee, 114; Cordial Steppe, Danny Sorenson, 114; Pass the Blame, 122; 
Cove Way, 122, and Black Czaravich, Kent Desormeaux, 114. 
</P>
<P>
The 10th race is the $40,000-added Bustles and Bows Stakes for juvenile fillies 
at 6 1/2 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
The first running of the $15,000-added First Down Dash, honoring one of the 
greatest quarter horses of all time, is the afternoon's fourth event. Ten 
passed the entry box for the 350-yard sprint.

Shirley MacLaine's song and dance act will be a little less dance and a bit 
more song. 
</P>
<P>
She blames age. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real life that's a problem. I can't run for a cab in the rain in the 
streets of New York anymore," the 56-year-old MacLaine said. 
</P>
<P>
After 40 movies, five TV specials, six books and a half a century of dancing, 
MacLaine said on the new syndicated TV show "Personalities" that it was time to 
"scale down the dancing." 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't that direly necessary to me. At this stage, I think it's bombastic 
because of my age you can still do this stuff," she said in the interview 
broadcast Monday.

Debra Winger says she loves U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) but hates political 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"If I wanted an aquarium, I would've bought one and lived in it," Vanity Fair 
quoted the actress as saying in its October issue. "That's why I don't have any 
problem seeing other men." 
</P>
<P>
Kerrey was governor of Nebraska when he met Winger in 1983 during filming of 
"Terms of Endearment" in his state. 
</P>
<P>
Their relationship ended in 1985, and Winger married actor Timothy Hutton in 
1986. Hutton and Winger had a son before they separated in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Winger and Kerrey are seeing each other again, but "not as often as I 
want," Kerrey said. "It seems like once every 10 years."

BOX OFFICE TAKE AT $3.5 MILLION, NEAR RECORD PACE OF '89

<P>
Moviegoers have paid more than $3.5 billion so far this year at the domestic 
box office, nearly matching last year's record-setting pace when the final 
total topped $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
With the surprise hit "Ghost" and the courtroom drama "Presumed Innocent" 
helping to keep sales from lagging in the late summer, the year-to-date box 
office total reached $3.51 billion over the weekend, according to Daily 
Variety, compared to $3.56 billion for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the total at the same juncture had hit $3.18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The top 10 movies of the weekend, led by "Ghost" and the horror-thriller 
"Darkman," drew $26.6 million during the three days, off 42% from the four-day 
total of $45.5 million registered over the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The lukewarm performance reflected the fact that no major new releases made it 
into the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
For the week, the total domestic box office reached $82.4 million, off from the 
$91.5 million of the year-ago week. In 1988, the figure was $88.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
During the weekend, "Ghost" became the second-highest grossing movie of the 
year, as it has now taken in $133.4 million in nine weeks. 
</P>
<P>
It trails only Disney's "Pretty Woman," which has brought in $170.3 million in 
26 weeks and was still showing at 872 screens last week. 
</P>
<P>
New Line Cinema's "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" has taken in $133 million in 
24 weeks, while Paramount's "Hunt for Red October" has grossed $120.6 million 
in 28 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Carolco's "Total Recall," which was the leading summer release until a few 
weeks ago, has earned $117.2 million in 15 weeks, and Fox's "Die Hard 2" has 
pulled in $111.1 million in 10 weeks.

FAMED BOUTIQUE IS SOFFIA WARDY'S SHOW TO RUN NOW

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soffia Wardy will smile with recognition if you mention the TV commercial about 
the pharmacist and his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Dad and daughter are sitting around the table at home, talking about how dad's 
customers have come to depend on him over the years and how the daughter, as a 
new pharmacist taking over the business, has big shoes to fill. 
</P>
<P>
The phone rings. It's an old and exacting customer. Daughter assumes the 
customer wants to talk to dad. But, to her surprise, she finds the call is for 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial over, torch passed. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Soffia Wardy knows that one. As the daughter of Amen Wardy, the owner of 
Orange County's best-known boutique, she has known what it feels like to face 
customers with purses full of money who come through the door expecting to 
spend it at the urging of a man who has been in the fashion business for more 
than 30 years -- not a young woman of 23 who has been in it for four. 
</P>
<P>
But the Amen Wardy store in Newport Beach's Fashion Island is her show now, and 
has been for more than two years. Her father now spends most of his time at his 
newer Beverly Hills store and leaves the Newport Beach operation to 
vice-president and general manager Soffia. 
</P>
<P>
And, she said, the transition appears to have worked, the result, she said, of 
longtime customers recognizing that they are still being watched over by the 
Wardy family. 
</P>
<P>
"What's made the business so successful," she said, "is his presence in the 
store. There are very few businesses like ours that still have the family 
involved. In businesses like Nieman-Marcus that started as family businesses 
and are now corporations, you don't see the presence of the family in 
management or in the store itself." 
</P>
<P>
However, she said, "when he started not being in the store, it kind of threw 
people because they're used to seeing him here. As I started to come in and get 
to know the customers they started feeling a bit more comfortable because they 
thought, 'OK, Amen's not around, but at least his daughter is here.' They felt 
like they were being well taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
A few customers balked at first, she said, but "my dad always backed me 100%, 
no matter what decision I made. When someone would (question a decision), he 
would turn to me and say, 'You have your decision right here.' That helped me 
tremendously, but it also made the customer feel that dealing with me was just 
like dealing with him." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not exactly. Wardy and her father have come to be not unlike another 
father-daughter business combine, Hugh and Christie Hefner -- he the 
high-profile, flamboyant point man of the Playboy empire, she the analytical 
business brains behind the operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very different," she said. "He's got this unbelievable amount of 
enthusiasm and energy. He can pump up the sales staff and the customer so much. 
I'm not like that at all. I'm in the administrative end a lot more, the 
organization of the store. He is much more into merchandising the store and 
getting into the dressing rooms with the customers. I deal a lot more with the 
customer concerns and the staff if they need guidance. That's the part that he 
doesn't like to do and has no patience for. So we balance each other out really 
well." 
</P>
<P>
However, Wardy's father had no intention of giving up his role quickly or 
easily, she said. After attending a language school and taking some fashion 
design classes in Italy, Wardy returned home to a job in her father's Newport 
Beach store in which she was told to do little more than sit in the store's 
jewelry boutique and answer customer questions about the items. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like, 'OK, you're my daughter, come into the business,' " she said. 
"He wanted to see whether I liked it and was capable of doing it. It wasn't 
made easy for me. But I decided I wasn't just going to sit there and twiddle my 
thumbs." 
</P>
<P>
She began reading up on fine jewelry, learning as much as she could about her 
then-limited job and reorganizing the filing system of that department. After 
six months, she slowly began to take on more duties, "doing a little bit of 
everything, trying to pick up as much as I could, and little by little I 
started easing into the management position. I learned a lot in a short time 
from my father, but I had to learn a lot where he didn't have the patience to 
say, 'This is how you do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her father, however, said he did recognize that his daughter had an aptitude 
and a love for the fashion business. 
</P>
<P>
"When she came back from school in Italy," he said, "she found she liked it, 
and she was very good. She worked out very nicely. She's terrific. I still have 
my finger in (at the Newport Beach store), but I couldn't have two stores 
without her." 
</P>
<P>
Being the daughter of Amen Wardy meant, at least for Soffia, that a career in 
fashion was inevitable. Her mother and aunt also worked in clothing 
manufacturing and retail and, according to Amen, Soffia's brother Jean-Paul, 
who is studying business at USC, will eventually enter the family business. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew," Soffia said, "that I'd inevitably end up working with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It had been very much a one-man operation, though. He had a lot of trouble 
relinquishing authority. He's just got to be in on everything. But little by 
little, when he started to feel more confident with what I was able to do for 
him, I was able to take things off his shoulders and for the first time he 
relinquished that authority." 
</P>
<P>
Her changes in the operation of the boutique have, for the most part, been 
subtle from the customer's point of view, she said. Most have been involved 
with internal organization and streamlining the backstage operation of the 
business. However, she now requires that her sales staff wear a uniform -- 
black suits with large gold buttons -- in the manner of European boutiques. And 
she is presiding over a remodeling job that will make the store more visually 
open. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, it is Amen Wardy who continues to do all of the buying for the 
store, and though she has never had one of her decisions vetoed, she says that 
"I run everything by him first." 
</P>
<P>
She puts in long weeks, often working 10 hours a day, six days a week. But, she 
said, her upbringing prepared her for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been like that," she said. "People have said, 'Why don't you have 
fun? I mean, you're only 23. How can you be so serious?' But that isn't an 
attitude I acquired just since I came into the business; it has always been a 
part of my personality. I've always been very serious, very responsible, very 
much into what I happen to be doing at the time." 
</P>
<P>
She would like to be able to give her father "more time and flexibility to 
travel a lot more and really enjoy, because he's been in this business since he 
was 14." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, "I don't think he'll ever retire. I think as long as he's 
alive and the business exists, he'll be a part of it. He's got that 
unbelievable energy." 
</P>
<P>
She sees her job as a kind of legacy, and one that she intends to remain with, 
if not necessarily expand. There are no plans, she said, to open more boutiques 
or turn the Amen Wardy name into a kind of empire. She is satisfied to continue 
to pull the backstage strings while her father's name is on the front of the 
building and his personality continues to shape what goes on inside. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there will ever be anybody to replace him," she said.

BASICS REIGN AT GRANDDADDY OF SURF SHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL FEINEMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is probably the oldest surf shop in the country, and as such, Hobie Sports 
Shop in Dana Point is something like a favorite pair of broken-in Levi's. 
</P>
<P>
After 40 years, the shop has a comfortable, lived-in feeling that transcends 
the framed black-and-white photographs of surfer greats and the classic boards 
hung throughout the store. 
</P>
<P>
It has established itself as a bellwether for the surfwear industry. And, 
lately, its clientele is sending out a clear message: "back to basics." 
</P>
<P>
"Surfers like to think they are first on the train," store manager Stephen 
Koehne explains. "Several seasons back, they jumped on neon colors. Since the 
mainstream picked up on them, however, surfers only use neon as an accent -- if 
at all. For the most part, they now prefer the deep rasta (reggae-influenced) 
reds, greens and yellows." 
</P>
<P>
They are also sticking with the established surfwear labels: Stussy, Gotcha, 
Quicksilver and O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
"The scruffier guy who likes the dreadlock image, even if he is a student, 
generally likes Gotcha," Koehne says. "Stussy appeals to the more 
fashion-conscious, affluent surfer; Quicksilver to the hard-core surfer, and 
O'Neill to the functional, Joe Average surfer who doesn't care about making a 
statement with his clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Some customers are loyal to one label; others buy two or three. Increasing 
numbers round out their wardrobe with Mossimo, Spot Sport or Redsand volley 
shorts and tank tops. And the most stylish top it all off with a pair of X-Isle 
sunglasses, a brand giving Ray-Ban some serious competition. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the weather and the environment cooperate, Koehne expects 
reasonably good sales for Southern California surfwear lines and for shops like 
his. But, he notes, "it used to be that you had to go to a surf shop to buy 
surf clothes. Now there are so many pseudo-surf shops everywhere and so many 
clothing companies that the supply may exceed the demand."

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five months have passed since Pat DeMar was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's 
disease, a paralyzing and fatal illness, and still her hands have not betrayed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"The disease takes everything away," she says. "What I can still do, though, is 
paint." 
</P>
<P>
Her canvas isn't made of paper but of cloth. DeMar paints abstract swirls and 
fluid lines on vintage tuxedos. 
</P>
<P>
She has learned to hold the paint brush differently to overcome the weakness in 
her hands, but the illness has not interfered with her deft strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Other activities -- walking, driving, cooking a meal -- are no longer possible. 
She speaks with difficulty. She's been told by doctors that she is dying -- a 
prognosis she refuses to accept. She is 32. 
</P>
<P>
It's the painting that gets her up in the morning. To her, it's not a pastime 
but a passion that she discovered when she was 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
DeMar's hand-painted tuxedos bring a new twist to formal wear. She typically 
paints the jackets' lapels, and sometimes the front and backs. Often, she'll 
adorn the tuxedo with some kind of whimsical decoration. 
</P>
<P>
One of her hottest new creations is a tuxedo garnished with miniature utensils, 
which she has dubbed "the dinner jacket." 
</P>
<P>
She decorated another tuxedo with seashells on its lapels, a reflection of her 
love of the ocean. She also created a white tuxedo shirt with shells on the 
front bib. 
</P>
<P>
"One Texas oil man wanted a tux with oil derricks painted all over it," DeMar 
says. She obliged. 
</P>
<P>
For Christmas, she'll introduce holiday tuxedos arrayed with miniature toys, 
ornaments and red chili peppers. 
</P>
<P>
One can see the influence of her favorite artists on the tuxedos. An ivory 
tuxedo she named after artist Jackson Pollock comes with Pollock-style 
splatters of inky black paint on the front and down one side of the back. Her 
love of Oriental art reveals itself in a cream-colored tuxedo with an Oriental 
woman painted on the front. 
</P>
<P>
"My designs really come from the past," she confesses. 
</P>
<P>
Her customers include top celebrities. Bette Midler bought a tuxedo with 
multicolored abstract swirls on the lapels. Diana Ross bought a short, white, 
bolero-style jacket with an abstract design, then called and ordered a skirt to 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Fairchild has the so-called rosebud jacket, featuring tiny fabric roses 
on the lapels and swirling stems on the front. Mick Jagger, Rob Lowe, Paula 
Abdul and Candy Spelling own DeMar's designs, and Donna Rice bought a pair of 
her painted earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her customers are women 25 to 50, but men also buy her clothes. Her 
art-to-wear sells all over the world -- without any promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't advertise," DeMar says. "As an artist, I'm kind of a recluse. I just 
like to paint and get my product out there." 
</P>
<P>
The tuxedos are available to store buyers in garment showrooms in Dallas, Los 
Angeles and Chicago. In Orange County, she sells her line through The Look and 
Apropos in Fashion Island, Newport Beach, and From Laguna in Laguna Beach. The 
tuxedos cost from about $300 to $500. 
</P>
<P>
Her partner, Michael Laux, helps her run what has become a $200,000-a-year 
business, handling all of the production work so that she can design the 
clothing from her wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"He's now my legs," she says. With his assistance, she continues to create a 
new line of clothing four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
The pair work out of an upstairs studio off Coast Highway in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of DeMar's desire to paint, to embellish the ordinary, is everywhere: 
Painted tuxedos fill a circular rack in the center of the room. In one corner, 
there's a stack of bracelets she made from hand-painted fiberglass -- the same 
material used to make surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
"They were discontinued -- most people don't want bracelets that big," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Her line of aluminum copper earrings hangs on one wall like miniature artworks. 
DeMar hand-paints each large earring with a colorful abstract design. The 
earrings have sold at Nordstrom, Bullock's and Macy's. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to painting tuxedos, she decorates baby clothes, shoes, kimonos, 
hats, T-shirts, chiffon tops and silk skirts with her flowing brushwork. 
</P>
<P>
DeMar and Laux have a factory in El Toro where garments are cut, sewn and made 
ready for the artist's hand. The vintage tuxedos come from second-hand stores 
and dealers all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
DeMar has also started painting vintage velvet coats. She decorated one black 
velvet swing coat with a serpentine design in gold on the lapels and sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
She has been painting clothes for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working in oil and acrylic, doing large canvases, when a bunch of people 
started doing hand-painted clothing. It looked so interesting, I started doing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
She later began manufacturing the clothes to paint on. Only the disease has 
slowed her down. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, I got sick," she says. "First I started limping, and then I 
started dropping things." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors first assumed that she had a pinched nerve, but her condition worsened. 
She could no longer walk. Laux took her to leading neurologists, who made the 
diagnosis -- amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS, a degenerative 
nervous-system disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fatal and not real pretty," DeMar says. Doctors told her there was no 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're not giving into that," Laux adds. "We're not subscribing to that 
diagnosis. There's no acid test for Lou Gehrig's disease." 
</P>
<P>
DeMar has refuted the stark prognosis and now undergoes alternative treatments. 
She travels to Santa Cruz and Idaho for ancient Chinese medicine, including 
deep tissue massage and acupressure. The treatments are painful and costly 
(they are not covered by insurance), but DeMar says she's starting to feel 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"Five months ago, I could barely talk," she says. "And I couldn't open my 
hands. Now I've gotten a lot of that back." 
</P>
<P>
An art auction is planned for Nov. 4 at Club Postnuclear in Laguna Beach to 
help pay her medical costs. Prominent artists will donate their work for sale. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, DeMar will continue to rise each morning and reach for her 
paintbrush. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard on me," she says. "A lot of the business used to be meeting with 
buyers and finding out what people wanted. Now, I'm a lot more limited. 
</P>
<P>
"What keeps me sane is for me to come here and paint. If I didn't have this, 
I'd go home and die." 
</P>

DRESSING FOR DINNER; 
</P>
<P>
DINING OUT MEANS SEEING AND BEING SEEN, AND PART OF THE L. A. RESTAURANT 
EXPERIENCE INCLUDES SITTING AT TABLES DRESSED AS WELL AS PATRONS ARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dining in Los Angeles is nothing less than a theatrical experience. People 
dress for the occasion because they intend to be seen, as well as to see. 
Restaurants "dress" too, priding themselves on decor that ranges from sleek 
high-tech to colorful south-of-the-border. In fact, style for the restaurant, 
as well as the patrons, is key. 
</P>
<P>
Since all the posing and positioning goes on just above the flatware, anyone 
serious about cutting the right image over dinner can not be content with the 
concept of a simple dinner dress. 
</P>
<P>
Designers have rallied to the cause, with glamorous dresses and evening suits 
that show off plenty of skin where it counts -- above the table. Dresses and 
suits with decollete show off a toned bust line. 
</P>
<P>
Faux jewels and pearls are piled on, and there can be even more drama with 
'60s-inspired hairstyles, sometimes, at least, created with wigs. 
</P>
<P>
Basic black has become too basic, given that many of these clothes are made in 
colors that seem to glow: lime green, sapphire, crimson, winter white and 
emerald. 
</P>
<P>
But women won't be the only ones winning raves for their outfits; the 
best-dressed tables this fall will be wardrobed in various costumes, from 
garden bouquets to crystal balls to gilded cherubs. And there won't be a 
stuffed shirt in the bunch. 
</P>
<P>
L.A.'s party planners have declared the end to the stuffy, formal table 
setting. While elegance is still the feeling all want to evoke, no one is 
suggesting starched white napkins and silver candlesticks. Ethnic themes, 
vibrant color and unconventional centerpieces are in vogue. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Fuhrman of Creative Concept catering has designed an autumn setting he 
describes as playful and inviting. 
</P>
<P>
The topiary centerpiece incorporates fresh red roses lightly sprayed with 
copper and bronze paint; the table, with place settings from Classic Party 
Rentals, is strewn with apple-scented potpourri, and gilded cherubs accent the 
floral lame tablecloth. 
</P>
<P>
"I find black very romantic," said Fuhrman, who designed the 25th wedding 
anniversary party last year for Creative Artists Agency's Bill Haber. 
</P>
<P>
Parties Plus, another party planner and caterer, uses an Oriental theme with 
black and gold brocade obi-like runners, black plates, black napkins tied with 
antique gold tassels, chopsticks, red lacquer soy sauce containers, and a tall, 
asymmetrical orchid centerpiece set in antique Chinese tea holders. "I think 
that table-top design is going to be the trend of the '90s," said Julie Loshen 
of Parties Plus. Loshen is a veteran of numerous film premieres and will be 
doing the Maple Center's fund-raiser this fall as well as the opening of the 
Harry Winston store on Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic food has become very important," she added, "and the role Indochinese 
food is playing in California is tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
Colin Cowie's modernistic table setting "commands a great sense of formality, 
but (it's) incredibly contemporary," said the man responsible for Hugh Hefner's 
wedding party decor. "I think we created a very serious look by using a few 
materials -- a less-is-more type of deal. I love the idea of putting 
inexpensive crushed glass with antique silver. You can break the rules." 
</P>
<P>
The table also incorporates silver lame napkins, Christofle silver chargers and 
a row of crystal balls. 
</P>
<P>
Vivid colors highlight the table top created by Sharon Sacks of Just Call 
Sharon, who will be doing the premiere party for Castle Rock film production 
company's premiere of "Misery" in December. She uses floral-patterned Dresden 
china (from Foster-Ingersoll), mirroring those flowers with David Jones' floral 
centerpieces set in silver snail-shaped vases. Aqua-blue Pratesi linens were 
set atop a stone-colored table. "Most of the major linen companies like Pratesi 
are realizing that people want color," said Sacks. "And something like this 
doesn't have to be overly expensive."

INNOVATIVE EARRING MAKER FINDS GOLD IN MOTHER LOBE OF JUNK;

FOUNDER OF THE JUNQUE LINE.

<P>
Where others see trash, Lucy Cordova sees a pair of earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Bicycle tires, old records, paper clips -- no common object is too lowly for 
her lobes. 
</P>
<P>
"I make earrings out of things you wouldn't normally think they're made of," 
says the 27-year-old woman. "People don't recognize the materials. They touch 
them and say, 'Oh, they're bicycle tires!' " 
</P>
<P>
Once she has finished applying paint, glitter, pearls and rhinestones to her 
designs, few people recognize the earrings for what they are: junk. Only on 
closer inspection does one see the tread of a tire, the grooves from an old 
record. 
</P>
<P>
"I just get things around the house," she says. "I broke a glass in the kitchen 
one day and when I saw the pieces I said, 'Hey, I can use these as earrings!' " 
</P>
<P>
Her glitzy, gaudy designs are strictly for fun. One pair features three roving 
eyeballs, the plastic kind found on small stuffed toys. She sells her earrings 
on torn pieces of cardboard under the name Junque for $5 to $10 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean it to be trashy," she says. That's why she gave "junk" a faux 
French spelling. 
</P>
<P>
Cordova's fetish for earrings led her to create the Junque line. 
</P>
<P>
"I love earrings. I have 80 pairs, and I didn't get my ears pierced until I was 
19," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, she bought a pair of earrings made from warped record fragments 
in a department store. She lost one of the earrings and couldn't find a pair to 
replace them. That's when she decided to make the earrings herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a couple pairs and wore them to work at a nightclub," she says. "My 
co-workers saw them and said, 'Make some for us.' I started selling them that 
way." Since then, she has expanded her line to include all kinds of everyday 
objects. 
</P>
<P>
Her method for transforming records into earrings is not terribly 
sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
She holds a disposable lighter underneath the record to soften the vinyl, then 
cuts it with a scissors into the shape she wants. Then she melts the piece 
again to create funky waves and folds. Often, one can still see the grooves in 
the vinyl on the finished product. 
</P>
<P>
"I want people to see they are records, so the lines show," Cordova explains. 
</P>
<P>
Old records have proven the perfect medium for her big earrings, which can 
measure several inches in length and diameter. Not only is the vinyl material 
malleable, it's light enough not to weight down one's lobes. 
</P>
<P>
She buys the record albums for about 50 cents each at swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know who these people are," she says. "But I think I melted 
Rickie Lee Jones once." 
</P>
<P>
After she has worked the vinyl into the desired shape, she decorates it with 
paint, rhinestones, sequins, glitter, and even small screws and bolts. 
</P>
<P>
Cordova adorned one pair with white lace and seed pearls. Only the black vinyl 
kept them from looking like something out of a bridal magazine. 
</P>
<P>
She has painted some with old fingernail polish and coated others with 
"webbing," a spray paint that gives a lacy effect. 
</P>
<P>
Once she found an old chain in her father's garage, cut it up and attached the 
links to her earrings. She wraps geometric-shaped pieces of vinyl with scraps 
of suede donated by a friend, then sprinkles rhinestones and beads onto the 
fabric. 
</P>
<P>
As a finishing touch, she often substitutes a paper clip for the conventional 
earring hook. 
</P>
<P>
Cordova cuts up bicycle tires and decorates them in similar fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"I buy the tires new," she says. "I couldn't use old ones -- they'd be flat and 
dirty." 
</P>
<P>
While shopping at a home supply store, she bought a vinyl floor tile and turned 
it into earrings too. 
</P>
<P>
She also makes earrings out of paper. She moistens heavy, watercolor paper, 
bends it into wavy abstract shapes and lets it dry. Then she paints the 
hardened paper and douses it with glitter. One pair of pink and purple squares 
has a raised cross and iridescent sparkles. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at things and think, 'Gosh, what can I do with this?' " she says, 
holding up a plastic bottle that she has cut up for future earrings. 
</P>
<P>
All of Cordova's designs are big, gaudy and fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I like big earrings." 
</P>
<P>
One pair features fragments of an old 33 rpm folded and painted with silver 
webbing. A triangle-shaped pair comes in teal-colored suede littered with a 
small rhinestone, beads and a narrow strip of iridescent film. 
</P>
<P>
"The earrings are good conversation pieces," Cordova says. "A girl looked at me 
the other day and said, 'You put a paper clip through your ear?' 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I like them." 
</P>
<P>
She's also started making bolo ties out of records. The vinyl's warped shapes 
suit bolos perfectly and appeal to men who want a different look when they're 
trolling the nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
Junque sells at Total Effect 'n' Fashion at 1142 N. Brookhurst St. in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Cordova concedes that her disposable earrings are not for everyone. They're for 
people who, like her, prefer clothes and costume jewelry that are "trendy and 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a certain kind of person," she notes.

THE ENDURING VALUE, ALLURE OF CASHMERE; 
</P>
<P>
SWEATERS: CONTINUING HIGH DEMAND AND SCARCITY OF SOFT GOAT WOOL HAS PUSHED 
PRICES HIGHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, Kathryn Bold writes about fashion for the View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clothing trends come and go with the seasons, but in the ever-changing world of 
fashion, cashmere endures. 
</P>
<P>
Sweaters made of this soft and expensive fiber, gleaned from the undercoat of a 
Kashmir goat, have always kept their allure. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Orange County, where a warm climate does not require a closet full of 
sweaters, there are shops devoted entirely to cashmere, including Cashmeres of 
Scotland in South Coast Plaza and The Cashmere People in Fashion Island. TSE 
Cashmere, a boutique that carries cashmere knitwear for men, women and 
children, opens this month in South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
"Cashmere is always in demand," says Michael Wu, manager of The Cashmere 
People. "Every year the price goes up. It's a better value than the U.S. 
dollar." 
</P>
<P>
He may be right. One customer told Wu she'd been wearing her cashmere sweater 
for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not high fashion -- it's high class," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Classy cashmere does not come cheap. Prices have escalated in recent years due 
to scarcity of the wool. 
</P>
<P>
Kashmir goats, which supply the fiber, live in the Himalayas. Ranchers have 
been mostly unsuccessful at raising the goats in captivity because the animals 
favor extremely high altitudes, so while demand for cashmere continues to 
increase, the goats' population has not. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could raise the goats myself, I would," Wu says. 
</P>
<P>
Once a year, the goats are rounded up and their downy underbellies combed for 
the soft, light fiber. 
</P>
<P>
One goat yields about 3 ounces of cashmere a year. It takes two to six goats to 
make a single sweater, Wu says. Small wonder that raw cashmere costs about 10 
times as much as regular wool. 
</P>
<P>
Scarcity has only added to cashmere's lasting appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby boomers have all grown up. They have good jobs, good lives and they 
want to enjoy good sweaters. They learned from their parents about cashmere. 
The name is always there," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Many are just discovering cashmere's benefits, particularly its incomparable 
soft texture and comfortable feel compared to heavier sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
People who are allergic to wool often find they can wear cashmere without 
itching. 
</P>
<P>
Others want cashmere sweaters as a status symbol they can wear on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
"Cashmere has a lot of snob appeal because of the price," says Mary Sjoberg, 
manager of Cashmeres of Scotland. A pure cashmere sweater sells for about $250 
to $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
Most cashmere sweaters come in traditional styles -- a crew or V-neck in a 
cardigan or pullover. At Cashmeres of Scotland, there's an elegant crew neck 
cardigan by Ballantyne in black cashmere with gold buttons for $450, or a cable 
knit cardigan in dusty pink by Vivex with gold buttons, also for $450. Both 
styles could last a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Still, to attract younger, more fashion-conscious customers, cashmere sweater 
designers have come up with styles that are downright trendy. 
</P>
<P>
One atypical cashmere sweater is an oversized cardigan with a hood that comes 
in bright orange, available at Cashmeres of Scotland for $1,150. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an astonishing color for cashmere," says Lisa Aastrup, sales clerk.

Most cashmere sweaters come in traditional colors such as burgundy, navy, gray, 
ivory and black, but some manufacturers have added more contemporary hues, such 
as purple, olive and turquoise. Cashmeres of Scotland carries a pale apricot 
sweater by Shirin that comes in a wrap style and ties at the side for $575. 
</P>
<P>
Patterns on sweaters have become bolder as well. In addition to the traditional 
argyles, one can find sweaters with fun "Picasso" prints and stained-glass 
patterns as well as embroidery and sequins, Wu says. 
</P>
<P>
His shop has a crew-neck cardigan in black with big turquoise polka dots for 
$460 and an equally exotic over-sized tunic in a black-and-ivory "pinto" 
pattern for $590. The sweater pairs well with cashmere ivory leggings for $325. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sweaters, one can find cashmere stirrup pants and leggings, 
capes, "jogging suits," dresses and even robes. 
</P>
<P>
Unless money is no object, Wu suggests choosing a classic sweater, one that 
won't be out of style by next season. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, many select the lighter one- or two-ply cashmeres 
instead of the heavier eight-ply sweaters. Cashmere sweaters aren't like paper 
towels. One can't judge their quality by the number of plies. The ply concerns 
only the weight of the yarn. 
</P>
<P>
"A one-ply sweater can be very expensive too," Wu says. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the quality of the cashmere with care. Some manufacturers weave other, 
less desirable parts of the goats' coat into the sweaters, Sjoberg says. 
</P>
<P>
For the highest quality cashmere, she recommends buying sweaters with the gold 
seal from the Scottish Cashmere Assn. Ltd., verifying that the sweater is 100% 
cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
If treated properly, one can wear a cashmere sweater for years. 
</P>
<P>
Sjoberg suggests putting the sweater in a cotton sack (a pillowcase will do), 
and adding cedar chips to ward off moths. 
</P>
<P>
If you find a hole in the sweater, take it to a weaver. Often the hole can be 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard of people throwing away cashmere sweaters that get holes in them," 
Sjoberg says, shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
Wash the sweater by hand using a mild soap, rinse completely and let it dry 
flat, away from sunlight, which can discolor the garment. The shape of the 
garment should come right back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a resilient fabric," Sjoberg says. "If you take care of it, it will 
last 20 years."

It is, without a doubt, the Tiffany's of shopping malls. In fact, Tiffany &amp; 
Co. is a tenant. 
</P>
<P>
But don't use the M word and make the mistake of referring to South Coast Plaza 
as a mere mall. 
</P>
<P>
The preferred terms here are gateway retail destination or America's premiere 
retail center. The latter was conferred on South Coast Plaza by American 
Airlines and the Walt Disney Travel Co. when the firms added the shopping 
center as a destination on their package tours -- along with such rival tourist 
spots as Disneyland, the San Diego Zoo and Universal Studios. (All of which 
South Coast Plaza outranks in terms of numbers of visitors, with an estimated 
18 million "guests" annually.) 
</P>
<P>
California's office of tourism even thought enough of the place to name it one 
of the state's "20 Fun Spots." 
</P>
<P>
But whether South Coast Plaza should be considered a mall, retail center or 
tourist attraction is immaterial. Die-hard shoppers have their own term for it: 
the ultimate. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many shopping connoisseurs routinely make 45-mile pilgrimages to South 
Coast Plaza from Los Angeles or 60-mile treks from San Diego to get there. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder. The center may not be California's largest mall (that honor belongs 
to Torrance's Del Amo Fashion Center), but it is surely the ritziest, featuring 
many shops more closely identified with Rodeo Drive or 5th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Among the tenants are Cartier, Mark Cross, Polo/Ralph Lauren, Yves Saint 
Laurent, Rive Gauche, Burberry's, Rizzoli, Gucci, Bally's of Switzerland, Louis 
Vuitton, Barneys New York (which includes a Hermes department), FAO Schwarz, 
Esprit, George Jensen, Orrefors, Porsche Design, Laura Ashley, Alfred Dunhill, 
Bruno Magli, Fila, Boehm Porcelain Gallery, Descamps, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, 
Jessica McClintock and Koala Blue. Plus, the Laguna Museum of Art has a branch 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Chanel, the current candidate for most-imitated retailer in the world, opened a 
store in South Coast Plaza earlier this week. Also scheduled to open soon are a 
Calvin Klein store, a Liz Claiborne boutique and a branch of New York's 
Metropolitan Museum of Art gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
This is the place to see it all. For along with such specialty shops, there are 
eight department stores: I. Magnin, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, Robinson's, 
Bullock's, The Broadway, May Co. and Sears. The total number of stores exceed 
300, including such familiar standbys as The Limited and The Gap. 
</P>
<P>
The center's stores are all located in or near one of three shopping "courts" 
(the Carousel Court, named for its replica of a turn-of-the-century carousel; 
the Jewel Court, which features a stained glass dome with 7,600 pieces of 
glass, and the Crystal Court, the fanciest area of all with marble floors, a 
75-foot-tiered rotunda and a spectacular, modern fountain in which water moves 
from outside to inside the building. By itself, the Crystal Court, which is 
separate and located across the street from the Carousel and Jewel courts, is 
larger than many shopping malls). 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the South Coast Plaza's retail section covers more than 10 acres. 
Indeed, the center is so big and diversified that some retailers (Esprit, for 
example) have even taken out two stores. 
</P>
<P>
High-end goods are sold in abundance. (A recent mall-sponsored survey showed 
that the average household income of the South Coast Plaza shopper is $62,000 a 
year.) But there are still plenty of offerings from stores such as Sears and 
such restaurants as McDonald's (though many mass retailers have left the center 
in the wake of so many upscale tenants). 
</P>
<P>
Like most malls, South Coast Plaza also contains a de rigueur collection of 
movie theaters. But unlike most other malls, the theaters are housed separately 
-- in the nearby South Coast Plaza Village and South Coast Plaza Town Center. 
That's so movie lines will not interfere with shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
The Town Center also includes high-rise office buildings, a 400-room hotel, the 
South Coast Repertory Company and the noted Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, which has hosted the New York City Ballet, the American Ballet Theatre 
and the New York City Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, there's a sculpture collection including works by Moore, Calder, Miro, 
Rickey and Dubuffet. 
</P>
<P>
And don't miss the impressive, 1.6-acre garden, "California Scenario" by 
sculptor Isamu Noguchi. With its "Forest Walk," "Desert Land" and bubbling 
stream areas, it is regarded by some as the state's most important outdoor 
garden open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
All considered, South Coast Plaza is not a bad little package, especially when 
you consider that less than 25 years ago the whole place was nothing but a lima 
bean field. It was developed in 1966 by C. J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to find shoppers with many complaints about South Coast Plaza, but 
when you do they're likely to bemoan the fact that the place can get so crowded 
you can spend 10 minutes just getting out of the parking lot. And those who 
prefer the larger size of the Beverly Hills branches of Saks Fifth Avenue and 
I. Magnin say they always feel like they're missing something in those 
retailers' smaller South Coast Plaza stores. 
</P>
<P>
The quibbles are small, however, when you consider that the persnickety 
shoppers who raise them are the same shoppers who respectfully refer to the 
center as "South Coast Mecca." 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Plaza is located at the interchange of the San Diego Freeway and 
Bristol Street in Costa Mesa, about 45 miles south of Los Angeles and 60 miles 
north of San Diego. It is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily except weekends. 
Saturday hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday hours are from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
