AL MARTINEZ: ROLEXING HIS WAY TO DANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A friend who always has striven to appear trendy has just come into ownership 
of a two-tone Rolex watch. It is something he has wanted most of his adult 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"A Rolex makes a statement," he used to say, "the way a tall, gorgeous blonde 
woman on your arm makes a statement." 
</P>
<P>
The friend, whom I shall call Ernie, is not likely to ever end up with a tall, 
gorgeous blonde woman, so I had mixed feelings when he informed me he had 
finally gotten a Rolex. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, I was glad he possessed half of what he has always wanted. On 
the other, I feel his life is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Wearers of these pricey trinkets have been falling victim to thieves at the 
rate of one a day. Three people have been killed for their Rolexes in L.A. 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie has one of the cheaper models. The two-tone is composed of gold and 
stainless steel and sells new for about $3,500. The President goes for $10,000 
up, depending on the number of jewels encrusted in its solid gold frame. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie bought his watch from an acquaintance for $2,000. He is paying him off at 
$200 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good price," I said. "Why did he sell it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you know," Ernie said evasively. "He's 52 and time isn't important to him 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"Time isn't important to a stockbroker? Since when?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, he figures we spend too much of our lives worrying about minutes." Ernie 
let that hang for a moment and then sighed. "OK, so the guy is terrified of 
getting killed. It's no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Ernie was clearly uncomfortable with the notion that his life was in danger 
from something he had always wanted. It was like discovering the tall, gorgeous 
blonde woman of his dreams was a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
He has cause for concern. We are in what one detective describes as a Rolex 
Street Crime Phase. For awhile, the fad among thieves was to snatch gold 
chains. Then it was robbery at automated bank teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is Rolex watches. 
</P>
<P>
This is not of personal concern to me, by the way, since I don't own any status 
symbols. No one is likely to kill me for my Timex or my Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
But I do feel sorry for Ernie and for the rest of you who have plunked down 
thousands to flash what it is no longer safe to flash. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad state of affairs," the aforementioned detective said to me, "when 
you can get killed for just wearing a watch." 
</P>
<P>
The policeman did not want his name used for the same reason Ernie preferred 
anonymity. He also owns a two-tone Rolex. So call him Fred. Ernie &amp; Fred, 
together again. 
</P>
<P>
A collector of antique watches, Fred traded up for the Rolex and wears it all 
the time. He realizes, of course, that this makes him a target, but not as much 
as someone who owns a President. 
</P>
<P>
The President is such a desirable model that people who fence jewelry have a 
waiting list of customers. They take orders for the watches and pass the orders 
on to their . . . well . . . Rolex acquirers. 
</P>
<P>
The two-toners are not that much in demand, Fred says, but just the same, he 
wouldn't wear one if he didn't carry a gun. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there is Mary Mulis. She not only allowed her name to be 
used today, but also informed me she wears $20,000 worth of jewelry every day 
in addition to her Rolex. 
</P>
<P>
No question, Mary is tough. A mugger grabbed her purse once in a parking lot 
and had to slam her against a car a couple of times to get the purse away from 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Then she chased him, screaming, and threw her shoes at the guy. Two men stopped 
the mugger, but let him go when he dropped the purse and pulled a knife. Mary 
probably would have wrestled him for the knife. 
</P>
<P>
"I refuse to be held hostage because I wear a Rolex," she said. "I bought it 
because it's practical and will last all my life. When I die, I'll pass it on 
to my children." 
</P>
<P>
I asked Fred if he had any advice for Rolex wearers, short of carrying a .38 
police special. He said, if robbed, don't risk your life by refusing to give up 
your watch. 
</P>
<P>
Then he added thoughtfully, "The crook may shoot you anyhow, but that's a 
chance you take." 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad we've become the kind of society that spins on status symbols. 
It's too bad we've become the kind of society that takes what it wants by 
whatever means necessary. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad, but it's a fact. 
</P>
<P>
Leave the watch home, Ernie, and buy a bumper sticker instead. There's one that 
says, "My Other Car is a Rolex."

ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer-comics night? It's no joke. The L.A. Cabaret in Encino hosted just 
such an event the other day. You had to read the small print to know that three 
of the five comics were former lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
But, another performer, Diane Faber, has combined both worlds -- litigation for 
a large firm by day, laughs in small clubs by night. 
</P>
<P>
"The two professions are similar," said Faber. "You have to prepare, be able to 
think on your feet and you want the people listening to get a certain 
reaction." 
</P>
<P>
When Faber, a regular at L.A. Cabaret, appears before yuppie-type audiences she 
tosses out one-liners about lawyering, such as: "My job is to be the most 
unpleasant person possible -- and I do it well." 
</P>
<P>
But she sometimes hesitates to reveal her daytime profession to blue-collar 
crowds. "Their reaction often seems to be, 'We don't have to laugh. You've got 
a good enough life,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Booking agents can be discouraging, too. "Sometimes," she said, "one will come 
up to me and say, 'I really liked your show -- uh, I was in an auto accident . 
. . ' " 
</P>
<P>
Only in L.A. Real Estate Notice of the Week: 
</P>
<P>
In a flyer announcing the listing of a $449,000 Silver Lake house, agent Andrew 
Chase included the usual sharp photos, florid adjectives, bright colors and 
exclamation marks. 
</P>
<P>
But -- and it hurts us to reveal this -- Chase concluded the flyer thusly: 
</P>
<P>
"Does anybody read these things? Come on -- sell this house and save the 
owner's neck!" 
</P>
<P>
The uncredited star of "Darkman," a film about a scientist wreaking revenge on 
the bad guys who disfigured him, is (envelope please) . . . 
</P>
<P>
L.A.'s ever-growing skyline. 
</P>
<P>
The scientist, dangling from a helicopter over Bunker Hill, whizzes by the 
73-story Library Tower as well as the twin, polished granite Wells Fargo 
buildings and crashes through a window of the California Plaza, disrupting 
executives who are taking a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, unlike the city, even found a use for the still-undeveloped 
Convention Center property, where a carnival is staged. 
</P>
<P>
Critics who contend that downtown L.A. is congested because of its many 
building projects can take solace in the fact that the movie's villain is a 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
Mention of L.A. is, however, omitted, possibly to lend credibility to a scene 
in which the hero is blown out of a loft in the industrial section. He survives 
because he lands in a wide, deep, flowing river. 
</P>
<P>
Since we recently mentioned USC grads who became Watergate figures, it's only 
fair that we give equal space to UCLA alumnuR. Haldeman. 
</P>
<P>
We received a press release about a company called Americom International that 
began: 
</P>
<P>
"What do George Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev and H. R. Haldeman have in common?" 
</P>
<P>
Give us a second. We're sure we can come up with an answer.

The crossroads of Veteran Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard, used by 127,401 cars 
during one recent 24-hour period, is L.A.'s busiest intersection, according to 
the city Transportation Department.

DEBATE OVER THE CHURCH AND CELIBACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 35 years I have taught in Catholic schools, and I have worked closely with 
the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
Celibacy does not mean isolation. Priests are fully aware of the many struggles 
in family lives, traumas among the secular and their own personal sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
Who was with me in intensive care unit, buried my parents, married my son and 
recently buried my oldest child? A priest! 
</P>
<P>
We would be honored to set his place at our table and dine on Christmas or any 
day that another family isn't in need. 
</P>
<P>
Do not stereotype the lonely ones who may prefer to isolate themselves on the 
few occasions they have. Even Christmas.

Rodriguez may have been a Catholic before but for sufficiently grounded, 
unfeigned Catholics, celibacy is not in peril and the likes of the Atlanta 
scandal are not new in the church whose attachments to God, historically or 
otherwise, remain a palpable truth.

Re: Jane Redmont's column "What Constitutes a Whole Person?" Commentary, Sept. 
7) concerning celibacy in the Roman Catholic Church. It is obvious that Redmont 
fails to understand the whole truth of Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
What was to me most disturbing was the lie that "The Roman Catholic Church has 
developed a culture of concealment and secrecy around these (heterosexual and 
homosexual) relationships (among priests) that breeds stress, lies and 
heartbreak." 
</P>
<P>
What is at issue here is commitment. When a priest vows celibacy, he disavows 
intimate relationships with anyone but Christ. Just as in marriage, our vows to 
our spouse disavow intimate relationships with anyone but our spouse. 
</P>
<P>
The recent scandal of Atlanta Archbishop Eugene Marino shows only that there 
are priests who break their vows, just as there are people who are unfaithful 
to their spouses. This does not constitute changing Roman Catholic doctrine any 
more than infidelity among married couples constitutes the abolition of the 
sacrament and institution of marriage.

UNFAIR WAYS

<P>
It is to be hoped that the decision of the Augusta National Golf Club to admit 
its first black member will inspire the oh-so-white private country club world 
of the United States of America to swing open its doors more widely. 
</P>
<P>
But hope is just about all anyone has to lean on. 
</P>
<P>
Shoal Creek Country Club, you may recall, agreed to accept its first 
African-American under the less than graceful circumstances of a $2-million 
advertising walkout by major corporations from the network telecast of the PGA 
Championship there. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, three of golf's governing groups issued new guidelines requiring 
clubs that want to host approved tournaments to prove that their membership 
practices do not discriminate against minorities -- or women. 
</P>
<P>
That clarion call prompted two major private golf clubs -- one in St. Louis and 
the other near Chicago -- to withdraw as hosts of planned PGA events. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Augusta Club is likely to hear the applause of no more than one hand 
clapping. Its decision was triggered when the corporate sponsors of next year's 
Masters -- held every year at Augusta, Ga. -- threatened to pull out. The 
sponsors are The Travelers Companies and Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the reality of this sorry overall performance, every male American 
-- i.e., the subgroup that constitutes the vast bulk of private golf club 
membership -- needs to examine his conscience with some care and determine 
whether continued membership in his club, if it is discriminatory, is worth the 
moral erosion of his soul.

INDEPENDENCE ISN'T BRED AT A CARNIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE PROMISES OR DOCTRINAL 
COMMITMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM FRENCH SMITH, William French Smith was U.S. attorney general in the 
Reagan Administration. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate begins hearings today on the nomination of Judge David Souter for 
associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. It is my fervent hope, and I 
suspect the hope of most Americans, that these hearings will signal an end to 
the Roman-carnival atmosphere that has come to envelop such events. 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary polarization of the confirmation process during the late '80s 
reached its zenith -- or more accurately, its nadir -- during the Senate's 
consideration of the nomination of Judge Robert Bork to replace Associate 
Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. Interest groups opposing Bork engaged in a display 
of political muscle more extreme than anything I have seen even in elective 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign was not limited to attempts to influence senators directly. 
"Studies" were issued describing Bork's opinions as a lower-court judge and 
academic writings in unconscionably misleading terms, which were then widely 
disseminated by stories in the press. One group even hired a well-known movie 
actor to film a TV commercial in which the actor made outrageous 
pronouncements, the import of which was that if confirmed, Bork would threaten 
our very way of life. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, as Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) stated in the debate before the final 
vote, "The man has been trashed in our house. Some of us helped generate the 
trashing. Others of us yielded to it." 
</P>
<P>
Political campaigns that inflame passions at the expense of reason and 
commitment to the public good, and in which lying and distortion play a key 
role, are always bad. But there are special and important reasons why a 
campaign of this sort involving a Supreme Court nominee is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Our Constitution grants people certain rights against -- and imposes certain 
limitations on -- the powers of the state. But in order to prevent the 
Constitution from being a mere piece of parchment, the framers also made sure 
it provided for institutional arrangements that would serve as the guarantors 
of those rights and limitations. One of these vital institutions is an 
independent judiciary whose only obligation is to the law, not to political 
factions. 
</P>
<P>
The principal constitutional protection for judicial independence is that 
federal judges, once appointed, serve life terms. But an important political 
protection is the reverence most Americans feel for the tradition of 
independence. That reverence has made it difficult for the other branches to 
use even those powers they clearly enjoy under the Constitution, such as the 
power to alter the number of justices on the Supreme Court, in order to make 
sure the court reaches a politically desired result. 
</P>
<P>
The political campaign conducted against the Bork nomination was in its essence 
an attack on judicial independence. Its basic premise was that the Senate 
should use its advise-and-consent power not to assure the appointment of a 
qualified jurist to the court, but to guarantee that the appointee would reach 
results satisfactory to powerful interest groups. This, of course, is 
completely at odds with the judge's oath to "administer justice without respect 
to person" and to "faithfully and impartially discharge and perform" judicial 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
So far no such campaign has been mounted in conjunction with Souter's 
nomination. The one danger sign is some of the claims made about the types of 
questions that senators should ask during the hearing. One argument is that in 
order to deserve confirmation, Souter must be willing to state in advance how 
he will decide cases involving abortion. Somewhat more subtly, others are 
insisting not that he make commitments on particular issues, but to particular 
constitutional doctrines, such as the right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
There is widespread agreement that Souter should not make any promises about 
particular cases. But, as Justice John Paul Stevens explained in a recent 
speech, the attempt to get commitments about doctrines is also wrong. It is at 
best futile and at worst very dangerous. Futile, because judges don't rule on 
general doctrines -- they decide cases. So that while a senator may think that 
a nominee who has embraced the right to privacy will surely protect the right 
to abortion, in fact any judge worth his or her salt will decide that question 
in light of the particular facts and arguments made in the particular case. 
</P>
<P>
And the attempt to get commitments is dangerous, because we want our judges to 
be open-minded, to decide cases on the basis of the law, not on the basis of 
promises made in order to get confirmed. As Stevens said, "That's not part of 
the independent judiciary that's such an important part of our tradition and 
our history." I hope the Senate will function as the guardian of that tradition 
and history during the course of the Souter hearings, rather than as its enemy.

IT'S ONE THING TO OPPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY, ANOTHER TO PRETEND SUPPORT WHILE

<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM BARR, William Barr is deputy attorney general of the United States. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House of Representatives is poised to take a major step backward in the 
fight against violent crime. In a bill purporting to be an anti-crime measure, 
the House Judiciary Committee has sent to the floor a proposal that would 
effectively abolish the death penalty in this country. 
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of Americans believe that the death penalty is a just 
punishment for the most heinous crimes. Thirty-six states have adopted capital 
punishment. Yet, for more than a decade, these laws have been rendered almost 
unenforceable by a system that allows convicted murderers to delay 
indefinitely, and ultimately to avoid, imposition of their sentences. After 
exhausting all appeals, murderers are allowed to file endless habeas corpus 
petitions in state and federal court, raising largely technical challenges to 
their convictions and sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The writ of habeas corpus originally was a legal device used to challenge 
attempts by the government to seize and detain an individual without trial. 
During the Warren court era, the writ was converted into a right to multiple 
appeals of issues already decided. This radical expansion of the scope of 
habeas corpus has allowed inmates sentenced to death to nullify their sentences 
through strategic delay. 
</P>
<P>
As of 1988, the average delay from time of sentencing to time of execution of a 
capital sentence was almost seven years. In that same year 296 individuals were 
convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death while only 11 capital 
sentences were actually carried out. Obviously, such delay undermines the 
deterrent and retributive force of the death penalty and breeds frustration and 
disrespect for our criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
The case of Robert Alton Harris illustrates the point. In 1978, while on parole 
for voluntary manslaughter, Harris shot two teen-age boys to steal their car 
for a robbery. Later, he confessed to the murders. He was convicted of 
first-degree murder and sentenced to death by a California jury in 1979. In 
1981, the California Supreme Court upheld this conviction and sentence, finding 
that "none of the many contentions raised by (Harris) has merit." Since that 
time, Harris has filed several state and four federal habeas petitions, each of 
which has been rejected. His sentence has still not been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of jurists chaired by retired Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. has offered a 
solution to this problem. If a state provides those on Death Row with counsel 
at state expense in state habeas corpus proceedings, the prisoner will get only 
two "bites at the apple" -- one state proceeding and one full federal review. 
No further habeas corpus petitions could be filed unless a claim of factual 
innocence were raised. The Bush Administration, the National Assn. of Attorneys 
General and the National District Attorneys Assn. support the principles behind 
Justice Powell's reform proposals. The House bill, far from curing present 
abuses, would make matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
First, the House proposal rejects the Powell Committee's quid pro quo 
principle. It affirmatively encourages the filing of successive habeas corpus 
petitions containing claims unrelated to guilt or innocence. At the same time, 
it imposes requirements for state-appointed counsel that very few lawyers can 
meet and even fewer state taxpayers can afford. Under the House proposal, 
convicted murderers like Harris would go on avoiding punishment by raising 
alleged technical "defects" in their sentences -- "defects" that have nothing 
to do with their guilt or innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the House proposal overrules two recent Supreme Court decisions that 
attempt to provide some reasonable safeguards against habeas corpus abuse. In 
Teague vs. Lane, the Supreme Court held that prisoners cannot use habeas corpus 
to challenge their convictions based on judicial decisions that were not even 
rendered at the time of their trial and appeals. The House proposal overrules 
Teague, and thus renders every criminal conviction in the nation subject to 
constant challenge based on cases that have not yet even been decided. The 
Judiciary Committee proposal also overrules the court's decision in Wainwright 
vs. Sykes. The Sykes decision requires that defendants follow state procedural 
rules in order to preserve claims for federal review, thus preventing criminal 
defendants from "sandbagging," that is, from holding back their claims in state 
court only to raise them years later in a federal proceeding. The House 
proposal would effectively reward defendants who ignore state procedural rules. 
</P>
<P>
It is one thing to openly and honestly oppose the death penalty outright -- a 
position the American people have rejected. It is another thing entirely to 
proclaim support for the death penalty in order to curry political favor while 
at the same time voting to erect a labyrinth of procedural rules to prevent the 
penalty from ever being applied. This crime bill is a sheep in wolf's clothing.

NATION'S JUDGES FEAR SPECTRE OF DREAD 5TH VOTE;

 The careers of Judge David H. Souter of New Hampshire and Chief Justice 
Leander Shaw Jr. of the Florida Supreme Court have much in common -- both were 
rising judicial stars in their states, and both were appointed to their state's 
highest courts in 1983. But while Souter will almost certainly become a justice 
of the U.S. Supreme Court, Shaw's career is likely to come to a crashing end in 
a retention election contest in November. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion issue has much to do with both scenarios, and will have even more 
to do with the future of every judge in America. 
</P>
<P>
Souter sat as a lower court judge in New Hampshire from 1978 to 1983. During 
this time, the New Hampshire Legislature considered a law that would have 
required judges to approve abortions for minors if parental consent was 
unavailable. On behalf of his fellow judges, who were not eager to assume this 
task, Souter successfully urged defeat of the measure. And after his elevation 
to the state Supreme Court, he never once had to rule on the controversial 
issue of abortion rights. If he had, he certainly wouldn't have been nominated 
for the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
At least he would have had job security, as New Hampshire judgeships are 
permanent until a mandatory retirement age of 70. Florida, on the other hand, 
is one of 16 states that, like California, subject Supreme Court justices to 
retention elections. Many other states subject justices to contested elections. 
In Florida, justices face the voters every six years. Shaw, the first black to 
sit on Florida's high court, was easily confirmed the first time and faced 
every prospect of an easy reconfirmation this November. The 59-year-old judge 
was even promoted to chief justice this year. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike New Hampshire, the Florida Legislature did pass a statute requiring 
minors to obtain the consent of a parent or a judge before an abortion could be 
performed. The constitutionality of that law was challenged by a pregnant 
15-year-old whose case came before the Florida Supreme Court after the U.S. 
Supreme Court decided last June to broaden allowable restrictions on abortion. 
The girl's lawyers argued that her right to choice was preserved under the 
constitution of the state of Florida, which, like California, Alaska and 
Montana, has an explicit guarantee of the right of privacy. The Florida Supreme 
Court agreed with the argument and Shaw wrote the majority opinion last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
That ruling turned Shaw's retention election into a referendum on abortion, 
with the anti-abortion forces calling for his scalp. Shaw is busily raising 
campaign funds, attempting to keep his seat. But the anti-abortion movement 
succeeded in electing a governor opposed to abortion and wields significant 
political clout in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
If, as the anti-abortion forces fervently hope, Souter's confirmation provides 
the fifth vote to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the landmark decision that gives 
constitutional protection to a woman's right to choose abortion, it will become 
increasingly difficult for judges to avoid deciding abortion cases. Since few 
states give judges the security of lifetime appointments, the Florida scenario 
has the potential for replay everywhere in America. Regardless of how judges 
decide abortion cases, there will be a deeply offended political constituency 
ready to be mobilized to unseat them. The prospect is an insidious threat to 
judicial independence: Will judges decide abortion cases by gauging the latest 
shifts in the winds that rage around this issue? 
</P>
<P>
There's another irony in the inevitability of the dilemma. For years, 
conservative critics of "judicial activism" have been chuckling up their 
sleeves, suggesting that the judges subjected to political attacks brought 
these attacks on themselves by sticking their judicial noses where they didn't 
belong. But even judges who were put on the bench because of their commitment 
to "judicial restraint" will find no escape from the issues that abortion laws 
present. 
</P>
<P>
Souter's elevation warmed the hearts of every judge in America. The elevation 
to the pinnacle of an obscure jurist whose main qualifications are that he's 
smart and works hard offers hope that it could happen to anyone. At the same 
time, the fate of Chief Justice Shaw will send a cold shiver down the spine of 
every judge in America. And judges with shivering spines are not what America 
needs in the 1990s.

MAGAZINES: U.S. EDUCATION DOESN'T MAKE THE GRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in 1983, the landmark study, "A Nation at Risk," found that "The 
educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising 
tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a nation and a people." 
</P>
<P>
Has the situation changed since then? 
</P>
<P>
Millions of parents sending their kids off to school this week know the answer: 
"Yeah, it's become worse." The Sept. 10 Newsweek reports, for instance, that 
test scores are down nationwide again this year. But then, Newsweek's experts 
ask, what do you expect of kids who are stupefied by TV and video games then 
forced to read lousy textbooks and study boring curricula? 
</P>
<P>
Any parent or teacher knows that the problem goes much deeper than that, 
though. The Sept./Oct. Utne Reader pulls together a collection of articles and 
essays addressing the problems of public education today and suggesting an 
intriguing array of potential cures. 
</P>
<P>
Educational reform organizations, for instance, suggest such radical measures 
as deregulating the teaching profession so that electricians and medical 
doctors and anyone else with knowledge to impart can step into classrooms and 
teach. 
</P>
<P>
"Training in pedagogy should not be a requirement for someone to be associated 
with young people," one reformer writes. Another expert would open the 
classroom to "co-teachers" -- why, for instance, shouldn't the town's Civil War 
buff share his knowledge with a group of fourth-graders? 
</P>
<P>
One of the most intriguing reforms suggested is to simply let kids tutor each 
other more often and in more situations, beginning in kindergarten. "Under this 
system," one expert explains, "the tutor is the one who benefits most from the 
tutoring. The tutors get a great deal of benefit from preparing the material, 
playing the tutor role, and feeling good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever changes are made, someone will have to push for them. But who? In an 
Utne piece excerpted from the Washington Monthly, Joseph Nocera argues 
persuasively that urban public schools have declined because the middle class, 
mainly the white middle class, have abandoned them. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, how many middle class Southern California parents, Angelenos in 
particular, feel strongly about improving public education but "aren't willing" 
in Nocera's words, "to sacrifice their children on the altar of their social 
principles?" 
</P>
<P>
Nocera believes that there is hope that the parents left behind will change 
schools: "It would take only a few eloquent black voices to turn the state of 
the schools into the moral cause it ought to be," he writes. Meanwhile, Nocera 
himself pulled his kids out of urban schools, and feels like "a co-conspirator 
in the one great crime of my class." Mere guilt isn't gonna solve much, though. 
In another essay, John Gatto, a New York City Teacher of the Year, says what 
millions of parents and teachers and probably students too feel: "We need a 
ferocious national debate that doesn't quit, day after day, year after year, 
the kind of continuous emphasis that journalism finds boring. We need to scream 
and argue about this school thing until it is fixed or broken beyond repair . . 
. ."

REQUIRED READING 
</P>
<P>
Readers get ready: A mo' better Spin magazine hits the stands next month. 
</P>
<P>
Director Spike Lee says he was only "vaguely familiar" with the rock 'n' roll 
magazine when editor and publisher Bob Guccione Jr., called him and asked him 
to be "guest editor" for a month. But Lee took him up on it, and the October 
issue is all his. 
</P>
<P>
How'd he do? Ask him. 
</P>
<P>
"As I look at the lineup, not only is it the blackest issue (which wasn't very 
hard to do) but, I might add, it may be one of their best," the filmmaker says 
in his editor's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
His brief tenure introduced the magazine "to a wealth of African-American 
talent: writers, journalists, artists, and photographers," Lee writes in his 
editor's remarks. That's true, although he would have introduced even more new 
talent if he hadn't put himself on the cover, included a profile of his sister, 
allowed many of the features to brim over with references to his own films, and 
conducted the two lead interviews himself. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's Q&amp;A with the Rev. Al Sharpton begs for a more skilled and skeptical 
interviewer. But that same naive and impassioned style makes Lee's interview of 
Eddie Murphy a quirky and refreshing joy to read. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, Lee and Murphy have seemed to represent opposite poles of the 
new black Hollywood: Murphy the commercial compromiser, Lee the righteous (and 
self-righteous) crusader. This interview does little to change those images. 
But as the two alleged enemies do their verbal dance, sometimes sparring, 
sometimes playing off each other's clear admiration for the other, struggling 
throughout with the question of just how bonded they should be by their race, 
both reveal deeper and deeper layers of character beneath the skin. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a very strong black consciousness but I am about gradual change and 
dialogue that is much more civil," Murphy says. Yet what he most admires is 
that Lee remains politically outspoken in spite of the frightening history of 
outspoken black leaders in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Lee seems most impressed that Nelson Mandela thanked Murphy for the laughs he'd 
given the African nationalist leader while he'd been imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
At their worst, both weasel out of responsibility for their mistakes and 
shortcomings by blaming racism. (It was even some unnamed "they" that kept the 
two from getting together before now: "How come we never just talked to each 
other?" Lee asks. "What they like to do is to separate," Murphy says.) 
</P>
<P>
But Murphy is much more willing to admit his own fallibility. After Lee 
steamrollers him with vague notions about how earthshaking a cinematic 
collaboration between the two of them would be, Murphy raises the possibility 
that they'd make a stinker. 
</P>
<P>
At their best, though, the two are clearly trying to do the right thing in 
fighting racism and injustice and in assuming a disproportionate share of 
responsibility -- as black men and as media heroes -- for young blacks in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
As promised, the rest of Lee's Spin package is sufficiently black it makes you 
realize just how white the media is -- and how impoverished it is for that 
homogeneity.

SPANISH CIVIL WAR AND FAMILIAL DEVOTION;

THE STUFF OF HEROES BY MIGUEL DELIBES TRANSLATED FROM SPANISH BY FRANCES M.

<TEXT>
<P>
The war between righteous and unrighteous can be fierce and bloody; nowhere 
near as bloody, though, as the civil war between two of the righteous. 
</P>
<P>
Spain was bled dry by such a civil war half a century ago, and it is still 
recovering. Pity the land with a surplus of the just or, as someone put it in a 
context I cannot recall: Alas for the country that requires heroes. 
</P>
<P>
It is the theme of Miguel Delibes's novel, titled with an ironic ambiguity that 
becomes abundantly plain well before the end. Delibes has written a 
post-convalescent novel; his is one of many voices to declare the Spanish Civil 
War dead, and buried too; though perhaps not entirely composted, broken down 
and dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
Published in 1987, or 48 years after the war ended, it strikes this reader, who 
lived and wrote in Spain at the end of the 1960s, as something of late and old 
news. Which does not deprive the book of value. Its humane political message, 
voiced throughout, comes in at the end with a sharp epigrammatic force that 
makes it feel new. As fiction, the book seems uncertain as to what it wants to 
be. It makes several choices, one or two quite good, and a third -- which 
submerges the second half -- like lead. 
</P>
<P>
The novel begins in 1927 in the bosom of a provincial family whose patriarch 
had fought as a red-bereted traditionalist in the Carlist wars and who -- in 
family legend -- could have a been a count, had he been pushier. The house is 
dark and stolid and emblazoned with an escutcheon. 
</P>
<P>
The stolidity is deceptive. Grandfather Leon, his three children and their 
spouses live in perpetual disputation. Although all but one are conservatives, 
the Spanish right was divided three or four ways, and each division was a small 
civil war to itself. 
</P>
<P>
Leon was one kind of monarchist; Uncle Felipe Neri, a colonel, was a different 
kind. Uncle Vidal was an anti-monarchist, a proto-Fascist and a free-thinker. 
Several of the women seemed to believe that the rightful ruler of Spain was Our 
Lady of Pilar and her attending clergy. 
</P>
<P>
Delibes softens these wars with familial devotion. And he lightens them with 
eccentricity. Into this faintly comic provincial pressure-cooker comes a 
portent. 
</P>
<P>
Gervasio, the grandson, erupts whenever he hears martial music. His skin 
develops bumps, his hair stands up straight. The grandfather is overjoyed; 
surely, the boy is a future hero. 
</P>
<P>
His uncle, Colonel Felipe, is also much moved, though more cautious. He keeps a 
journal of what he calls Gervasio's horripilations. They occur not only from 
music but at patriotic rallies, and at the Good Friday procession of 
blood-stained Christs. He gives Gervasio a set of his uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Telmo, the boy's father, has them burned. He is the plebeian in-law who married 
upward; his family are shopkeepers, he is an atheist and a liberal. His wife 
prays for him; his son wonders if he is damned. 
</P>
<P>
Gervasio and his prothetic stigma -- we see the Civil War coming, of course -- 
make a wonderful image, particularly as the author writes as a real little boy 
living in the picaresque life of his family and his town. The passage of time, 
however, is not kind either to him or to the book. 
</P>
<P>
Gervasio turns into an adolescent who hangs out with his schoolmates and gets 
up to various kinds of unremarkable mischief. The horripilations go into 
temporary recess. They reappear when the Civil War breaks out. Telmo is 
imprisoned with other "leftists" in the town bullring, though Felipe's 
gallantly exercised connections keep him alive; unlike his two socialist 
brothers, who are murdered and mutilated. At the same time, other relatives are 
horrifically killed by the Republicans in Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
Dreaming of heroism, Gervasio joins the navy with his schoolmates. The second 
half of the book shows him on a training ship and then on a warship. We miss 
his family; the last part of the book is a tedious account of a young man who 
dreams of glory but finds he's a terrible sailor. 
</P>
<P>
His wartime experiences break down his illusions about the glory of the Franco 
"crusade." A kindly superior turns out to be a Republican spy, and is arrested 
and shot. At the end, he reflects. His Republican superior was a hero too. So 
were his murdered relatives on both sides. It is not the cause -- the 
righteousness that confers glory. "Couldn't it be the other way around? 
Couldn't it be that the man who dies generously is the man who ennobles the 
cause he serves?" 
</P>
<P>
It is an apt and shining discovery, a redefinition of heroism for a

YOUR WHEELS: PRESSURED BY FAULTY OIL INDICATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: While returning from vacation in my 1987 Thunderbird, the chime on 
the dashboard sounded and a picture of an oil can lit up. I pulled off the 
highway and checked the dip stick, which read full, and the coolant, which was 
full. I continued home, but this condition occurs often now. It only lasts for 
a few minutes. The Ford dealership is unfamiliar with this problem. Can you 
offer any ideas about the cause? -- K.O. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It's a risky proposition to fool around with a low oil indication, 
since low oil pressure or low oil level that causes a loss of pressure can ruin 
your engine. Low pressure is often accompanied by high engine temperature, loud 
knocking noises and eventually a seizure in which engine parts become welded 
together. 
</P>
<P>
The dashboards of most modern cars contain lights that alert the driver to a 
problem -- unfortunately after it has already occurred. At one time, most cars 
came equipped with oil pressure gauges that provided a continuous readout. They 
were replaced with the lights, which immediately became known as idiot lights. 
</P>
<P>
These dashboard lights have partially redeemed themselves in recent years, 
though. In the past, idiot lights have signaled only that the pressure in the 
lubricating system was below normal. But newer cars, including your 
Thunderbird, have a sensor that will activate the dashboard warning if the oil 
level drops too low. That way, if you have neglected the onerous job of 
checking your oil dipstick, your engine will be saved from ruin. 
</P>
<P>
The Thunderbird chime and light go on simultaneously when the oil pressure 
drops to about 50% of normal. At idle, for example, normal oil pressure should 
be 30 pounds per square inch; the oil light indicator will light up at 15 
pounds per square inch. 
</P>
<P>
There are many specific causes of low oil pressure, but general causes include 
a faulty oil pump, a malfunctioning oil filter, grossly worn out parts in the 
engine or low oil. 
</P>
<P>
The mechanics at your dealership should have been able to determine with 
certainly whether you have low oil pressure or not. It is possible to attach a 
mechanical pressure gauge to engine that should provide an exact reading of 
your pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly, either the pressure sensor or the level sensor is malfunctioning. One 
distinct possibility is that the level sensor is faulty, since it can become 
contaminated with engine deposits, such as tar. Unlike the pressure sensor, the 
deposits can cause an intermittent false alarm. If this is the problem, the fix 
will be inexpensive.

LEONA VALLEY'S 'COUNTRY' FOLKS FEEL THE SQUEEZE; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: SOME SAY A 7,200-HOUSE PLAN OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER, AND 
OTHERS SAY IT MIGHT BENEFIT THE ENTIRE ANTELOPE VALLEY.; 
</P>
<P>
LEONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LUSTIG, Lustig is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just west of Palmdale, between Portal Ridge on the north and the Sierra Pelona 
Mountains on the south, lies the small and narrow Leona Valley and its 
principal community of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
Life tends to be a little slower for the 1,600 residents of Leona Valley. Most 
residents consider themselves "country" -- which they say makes them truly 
appreciate the high desert land they live on. 
</P>
<P>
Water is scarce -- most residences rely on wells. Brush fires during the summer 
months are a continual threat. And whenever residents feel a slight rumble, 
they wonder if it's because of a passing truck on Elizabeth Lake Road -- the 
main artery through Leona Valley -- or because the town sits on the San Andreas 
Fault. 
</P>
<P>
But now many in the community see a more immediate danger to their lifestyle: a 
7,200-house development to be built on the nearby 11,500-acre Ritter Ranch, 
which is owned by Merv Adelson -- former chairman of Lorimar Telepictures who 
recently separated from his wife, TV newswoman Barbara Walters -- and his 
partner, Irwin Molasky. Construction of single-family homes is scheduled to 
begin in 1993 just outside the western boundary of Palmdale and continue until 
2015, when two-acre mini-ranches will be completed a few miles from the 
community of Leona Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Schools, shops, an amphitheater, equestrian center, golf course and walkways 
are all to be part of the Ritter Ranch complex, with about 7,500 acres expected 
to remain as open space. 
</P>
<P>
A Leona Valley town meeting in November involving 31-year-old Peter Wenner, 
Ritter Ranch's project manager, became a shouting match, and although 
discussions between town representatives and the Ritter Ranch Associates have 
begun, there remains a wide chasm of mistrust on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Adelson declined to comment on his plans, but newly elected town Councilman 
Norm Wolstein, 39, cited the residents' major concerns: possible water 
shortages; a desire to preserve the wetlands (an area just south of Elizabeth 
Lake Road, with its own characteristic wildlife and ecology); an influx of 
traffic on Elizabeth Lake Road, much of it heading for nearby Bouquet Canyon 
Road, which leads to Los Angeles; and the developers' request for annexation by 
the city of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Wolstein wants Leona Valley to retain the attractions that drew him and his 
family there last year from Sepulveda. It was great "to get out of the 
congested crime-ridden city," he said, yet still be close enough to commute to 
his aerospace job in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a cherry festival and a parade with all the kids every year in Leona 
Valley," he said. "There's a July Fourth picnic -- without fireworks. We have 
community meetings; people get involved here. And they're very friendly. It's a 
great place." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann Floyd, 50, said, "If the project goes through, the current residents 
of Leona Valley become 'Old Town,' " adding that people would be economically 
shut out of the new project. 
</P>
<P>
The new housing units are expected to cost between $175,000 to more than 
$500,000, while the price of an average existing house on a three-acre lot in 
Leona Valley is about $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got the potential for disaster here," Floyd said. "Fifty percent of us 
get our water from wells. We've learned to live with the environment. City folk 
get the idea you get water by turning on the tap and that chickens come from 
Styrofoam containers in the meat department. There's an end to everything, and 
if you stretch it too far. . . ," she said, shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Johnstone, 36, a resident for two years, said he loves being able to look 
at the sky at night and see the stars. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see the valley cut up into little pieces with one acre or 
less," he said, adding that lot sizes in the area now average about three 
acres. "I'm concerned about smog, traffic, water, crime, sewers, my whole 
country way of life disappearing." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone in Leona Valley regards the Ritter Ranch project as an 
intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew one day it would be developed," said Gloria Bryant O'Brien, who has 
lived in Leona Valley 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The land-use people," she said, referring to the slow-growth advocates, "are 
all new people, and they assumed this valley grew the way it was by itself. 
</P>
<P>
"The sellers have a right to split that land into 60 different developers if 
they want. If they did, we'd be dealing with 60 different groups of people. 
Considering what that could be, this is OK with me," she said. "This particular 
group has what looks to me to be more than just a reasonable plan, it looks 
thoughtful. The development on the Leona Valley end will be so sparse, you 
wouldn't see it. The other end is the denser housing." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Ritter, 61, former owner of the ranch, views the situation in terms of 
hard reality. 
</P>
<P>
His grandfather, John E. Ritter, came to Leona Valley with his wife to 
homestead 160 acres in the 1880s. His sons acquired additional land, and by 
World War II the 12,000-acre Ritter Ranch produced wheat, cattle, hay, barley, 
honey, grapes and wine. 
</P>
<P>
But today, as Ritter bent down on one knee and ran the soil of his former ranch 
through his fingers, then watched it blow away, he said economics don't make 
farming feasible any longer. 
</P>
<P>
Before his family sold the land to investors for just under $1 million in 1957 
and leased it back until 1972, the net income on the ranch was about $50,000 in 
a good year, he said. "We couldn't gross enough to meet the taxes in the late 
1960s," he said. Ritter Ranch Associates purchased the land from the investors 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Dry-land farming takes a lot out of the soil," he said. (Dry-land farming uses 
little water, and is beneficial for such crops as barley and other grains.) 
"When we have wet years here, you can grow a good crop. But the land just gets 
wore out. It's used up." 
</P>
<P>
Ritter, a former Leona Valley resident, lives in nearby Wrightwood, working for 
the developers as a consultant. His job is to try to explain to local residents 
the advantages they would realize from the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the politics of the valley," Ritter said. "Over the last couple of 
months, I've interviewed close to 50% of the families there. After I interview 
them, then they feel fairly good about it. Some of them don't want any 
development, even someone building a house next door to them. But most people 
have an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Evans, Palmdale planning director, said of the development: "There are a 
lot of really good opportunities for all parties concerned. It has the 
potential of being a very dynamic project for all of the Antelope Valley, but 
there are still issues needed to be resolved, such as the question of the 
interface between Ritter Ranch and Leona Valley." 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley-East Kern Water District is studying the water supply, and 
the wetlands concern is being addressed by various ecological groups. Also, an 
environmental impact study of the project is about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the residents fighting Ritter Ranch realize that development of some 
kind is going to go through and that there is little they can do about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognize that property owners have rights to develop their property," 
Johnstone said. "The only thing I'm asking is, do it within certain guidelines. 
Make it compatible with the way we are now." 
</P>
<P>
Wolstein said the developer has been gradually moving toward more 
accommodation, a different tactic from that used during the initial meeting 
last November between Wenner of Ritter Ranch Associates and Leona Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to explain the project to about 300 townspeople in broad terms, 
Wolstein said the meeting at the Leona Valley community center quickly 
degenerated into an emotional screaming match. 
</P>
<P>
"Ritter Ranch Associates wasn't prepared to go into much detail," Wolstein 
said, "and I think that was perceived as if he was holding information back. We 
were thinking the worst and he didn't do anything to dispel our fears." For his 
part, Wenner refuses to talk about what happened that night, but since then, he 
and other Ritter Ranch representatives have been meeting with Leona Valley 
residents in groups no larger than three or four at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to the town meeting to get out the facts of the project," said project 
manager Wenner, who presented the preliminary plans for the project. "Nothing 
is carved in stone," he added. "This is a first cut, going in to get comments. 
If we weren't interested in the residents' input, they wouldn't be able to see 
this. Leona Valley has been prominent in our minds since the very first day." 
</P>
<P>
To make sure its concerns are addressed, and at the suggestion of the office of 
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, whose district includes northern Los Angeles 
County, Leona Valley elected its Town Council. "We don't have any legal 
authority because we're not incorporated," Wolstein said, "but we can advise, 
and the community can speak with one common voice." 
</P>
<P>
The election, on July 10, had 16 candidates running for five permanent council 
seats and two alternates. Of 945 registered voters in Leona Valley, 437 voted, 
and six of the seven seats were filled by slow-growth advocates, including 
Wolstein. 
</P>
<P>
"It's helped already," Wolstein said of the council. "There have already been 
conversations with the Ritter people about coming to the table to bargain with 
us, whereas in the past they may have been a little reluctant." 
</P>
<P>
Wenner said he wants to persuade Leona Valley residents that "we're not a bunch 
of ogres that are going to go in and destroy your lives. Whenever a project of 
this size gets announced, there is always an evolutionary process. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We've been real sensitive to the people in Leona Valley. Since we are such a 
large land mass, we're able to appropriately reduce density going west, and as 
we head west, the density and lot sizes decrease," he said, referring to the 
move toward the community of Leona Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Some Leona Valley residents remain skeptical, and some are cautiously 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Bailey, 70, said: "They're not being totally honest with us. They tell us 
we're not going to be able to see most of the development from the road. But I 
live on the side of a hill and can see all the way down to Wrightwood. Don't 
tell me it's not going to have an impact." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Bob Mallicoat, 67, who owns the 315-acre Pitchfork Ranch 
just west of Leona Valley, said, "We hope to be able to come to a middle 
ground. I keep hopes high. I'm a positive thinker."

<P>
For 24 years, Neil Derrough had a front-row seat to the well-documented 
corporate turmoil that gripped CBS, once known as the "Tiffany of the 
networks." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, when Eric Ober was named president of CBS News, Derrough, now 
the general manager of KNSD-TV (Channel 39), greeted the news with a certain 
amount of resignation, a sense that he had seen it all before. 
</P>
<P>
Just for a second, he also must have flashed on his own career, and how close 
he came to rising to the top of television's most prestigious organization. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Ober worked for Derrough, who served as president of CBS 
Television Stations for six years until he left the network in 1986. It was his 
duty to oversee the operations of the five TV stations CBS owned throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"In a large corporation, you spend a certain amount of time, and you make a run 
for it," Derrough said over lunch a few days after Ober was named to head CBS 
News. "Was there a point where I might have liked to be Group Broadcast 
president? Yeah. But the cards didn't fall that way." 
</P>
<P>
Timing is everything, and the 52-year-old Derrough has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"CBS had become a different place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39 offers Derrough plenty of challenges. When he took over, it was 
perennially the third-rated news operation in the city. In his two-year tenure, 
he has changed the station's call letters and given it a new identity. After 
little movement, the station's ratings have slowly started to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he has a 3-year-old daughter by his wife of nine years -- Sharon 
Lovejoy, a former CBS correspondent -- Derrough's priorities have changed since 
his days at the network. He talks about the satisfaction of operating a TV 
station and the disappointment of not spending more time with his now 
25-year-old daughter from his first marriage, a marriage that dissolved during 
his CBS tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"My life objective is much different today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Living and working in San Diego -- far from "Black Rock," the CBS corporate 
headquarters in New York -- has allowed him "to focus on what matters," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Family and friends made a difference; it wasn't all the deals I made," he 
said, referring to then and now. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard, though, for Derrough not to have fond memories of CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a heyday, it was an era. It had been the dominant TV influence. . . 
. It was like tampering with the crown jewel of the medium." 
</P>
<P>
As for the new president of CBS News, Derrough said Ober is the "right guy at 
the right time." The news people will "accept him," and he "knows what the job 
is," in the sense that he has been involved at every level of the network for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, Derrough said, "he's a businessman. He's been accountable." 
</P>
<P>
Ober is charged with boosting CBS' lackluster ratings, stabilizing management 
and returning some past glory. 
</P>
<P>
According to published reports, Ober got the news job because he was a CBS 
insider, a contrast to the outsider image of his predecessor -- David Burke, a 
former ABC News executive. Critics said Burke was unable to deal with the 
intricacies of CBS management, either on financial or personal levels. For 24 
years, Derrough was the consummate CBS insider, groomed within the 
organization, a veteran of the tradition and corporate struggles that shaped 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
Derrough started in 1962 in the sales departments of CBS Radio stations in 
Detroit and Boston. In 1967, he took over as general manager of KCBS Radio in 
San Francisco. While most of his contemporaries were in television "selling 
(commercial) spots in Los Angeles," he was running the first all-news CBS radio 
station on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Radio was in a changing period," Derrough said. "Radio was essentially 
forgotten. All the bright, young, attractive people were running as hard as 
they could to TV." 
</P>
<P>
But with videotape, advanced satellite technology and CNN still years away, 
radio was still the medium with instant news and immediacy. The late '60s and 
early '70s were an exciting time in history, and news radio flourished. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Derrough took the job of general manager of WCBS Radio in New York, 
the CBS Radio flagship, which was finding success with an all-news format. 
</P>
<P>
"News radio has a lot to do with developing the appetite for news, letting 
people know that there was an audience for news," Derrough said. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '60s and early '70s, Derrough and most CBS employees had little 
doubt who was the guiding hand of CBS: William S. Paley, the founder of CBS. 
Although Paley turned 70 in 1971, he personally interviewed Derrough for the 
WCBS job, and was still actively involved in all aspects of the organization, 
meeting with top officers three to four times a years, Derrough said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Derrough moved into television, taking the general manager post of the 
CBS-owned and -operated WBBM in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"Derrough . . . was at WBBM to bring order to the place," Peter Boyer wrote in 
his book "Who Killed CBS?" "The ratings and attention WBBM were getting were 
nice, but it was too maverick. The carte blanche was gone." 
</P>
<P>
One of Derrough's first acts was to take Van Gordon Sauter off the air. Often 
described as something of a Hemingway-esque character in both style and 
appearance, Sauter would later preside over CBS News during the early 1980s, 
its most tumultuous time, eventually rising into the CBS corporate structure 
before being forced out in 1986 in yet another shake-up. 
</P>
<P>
"We called him into the office and told him we were going to take him off the 
air for Bill Kurtis," Derrough recalled. "He looked at us, pushed his chair 
back, and said, 'I don't know about you, but I'm going to go out and get 
drunk.' " 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, Sauter would become Derrough's boss and, ironically, an ally 
in the corporate infighting that gripped CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Derrough says the CBS of lore began to come apart in 1978, soon after he had 
taken over WCBS-TV in New York. In Derrough's eyes, the problems started when 
the decision was made to add another level of management to each division of 
CBS -- sports, news and entertainment -- creating, in effect, independent 
fiefdoms. 
</P>
<P>
Until that point, "the network was run like a TV station," Derrough said. "One 
guy had run all of it, and each department reported to one guy." 
</P>
<P>
And, in Derrough's opinion, it ran well enough. In the new system, each 
division was looking out for its own success, not that of the company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, when Derrough was named president of the CBS Television Stations, the 
highest post on his side of the corporate ladder, CBS was still riding high, 
with Walter Cronkite in his last days and the network programming doing well in 
the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
When CBS network programming started to slip in the ratings, and video and 
cable started to further cut into the share of the network's audience, CBS 
became the focus of a fierce and well-documented corporate battle. Ted Turner 
talked of a hostile takeover. Newspaper articles said Sen. Jesse Helms wanted 
conservatives to buy it. Meanwhile, Paley was in his 80s, and the company was 
taking on a new look. 
</P>
<P>
The mid-1980s became the era of massive budget cuts throughout the 
organization, most publicly in the news department. 
</P>
<P>
CBS News, the "house that Murrow built," had always operated aloof from 
corporate pressures. To many, CBS News represented the heart of CBS, its 
corporate identity. It didn't matter how many millions it lost. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Derrough says, the company definitely needed to be trimmed, 
especially the news department. The loss of dozens of employees and a tighter 
budget, he said, have not drastically hampered the operations of CBS News. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen no evidence of it having a dramatic bearing on how they cover the 
news," Derrough said. 
</P>
<P>
But he does object to the manner in which cuts were implemented, particularly 
calls for mandatory staff cuts, regardless of the division's efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Because the TV stations generally operated as money-makers, Derrough for many 
years worked outside the fray. But, as the company looked for every dollar, the 
stations were increasingly pulled into the discussion and given the same 
cost-cutting mandates as the other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures mounted at every level of the company, Derrough said. He recalls 
it as an "unpleasant" place to work. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a palace revolt. Nobody knew who was going to stay, and who was 
going to be crowned. 
</P>
<P>
"It ended up at a point . . . I had reached a point where I had to leave," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Derrough said the end came when he was asked to fire Frank Gardner, the general 
manager of KCBS-TV (Channel 2) in Los Angeles. Three weeks earlier, Channel 2 
had debuted an experimental news format called "the wheel," which featured 
20-minute looks at one subject, such as health or fitness. Critics ripped it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I refused to (fire Gardner), they said, 'Well, it sounds like you're 
resigning,' " Derrough said. 
</P>
<P>
After taking time off, Derrough went to work for Gillett Communications, first 
running a station in San Luis Obispo and then taking over Gillett's San Diego 
operation in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
KNSD may be far away from New York, but controlling a TV station was always an 
optional goal of his career if things didn't work out at CBS, Derrough said. He 
may miss the chauffeur and the intensity of network life, but he likes the 
control his current job affords him, the ability to bring change and to 
interact with the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Running a TV station in a major market is one of the best jobs in the 
business," he said.

Faux Pas: Art thieves who thought they swiped a museum-quality collection last 
week in Cannes, France, are probably mourning the one that got away, police 
said Wednesday. Collector Jacques Schwarz-Fuchs told authorities that at least 
eight of the stolen works are copies of paintings by Pablo Picasso, Pierre 
Auguste Renoir and other 19th- and 20th-Century artists. But the thieves left 
an original Camille Pissarro that probably was worth more than all the stolen 
items together, police said. BETH KLEID

Sawallisch to Philly: German impresario Wolfgang Sawallisch, whose association 
with the Philadelphia Orchestra dates back 24 years, Wednesday was named 
musical director of the orchestra. Sawallisch, director of Germany's Bavarian 
State Opera in Munich, will take over the podium in the 1993-94 season. He 
replaces Riccardo Muti, who will end a 12-year reign with the Philadelphia 
Orchestra after the 1992 season. BETH KLEID

'Winged Figure' in Laguna: Artist Jim Morphesis' controversial painting, 
"Winged Figure," which was rejected by the John Wayne Museum of Art because 
airport officials found it unsuitable, will be on display at the Laguna Art 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Museum director Charles Desmarais said he is showing it to "lift the gloomy 
veil" from the painting. The work, which was originally commissioned by the 
airport, is a nude portrait of the Greek figure Icarus. It will be on display 
at the museum from Sept. 28 to Dec. 16. BETH KLEID

LOUIE LOUIE OFFERS ENTERTAINING HOUR OF RADIO-READY TUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ROSENBLUTH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Garage band music it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Though Louie Louie shares his name with the quintessential grunge-guitar hit of 
the '60s, he draws little inspiration from the chaotic, 
anyone-can-be-a-rock-star sound it exemplifies. Slick and snap-crackle-pop 
crisp, the sloe-eyed singer's debut album, "The State I'm In," could only have 
been recorded in the most high tech of studios. 
</P>
<P>
Louie Louie, the singer from Santa Ana whose real name is Louie Cordero, makes 
no secret of just who his influences are. Average White Band and Prince song 
titles work their way into his lyrics, and in concert Tuesday night at the Roxy 
in Hollywood, the artist paid homage to Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Madonna and 
the disco-era S.O.S. Band by slipping snippets of their tunes into the midst of 
his own. In fact, Louie Louie's strength lies mainly in his ability to parrot 
so many styles so ably. Though there's little original about his act, it is at 
least refreshingly diverse. 
</P>
<P>
Backed my enough players to put up a football team (some of whose sole function 
seemed to be to sway with the music), the singer bounded from the imminently 
enjoyable dance pop of "Pushin' It Too Hard" and "Stop Lookin' for Someone 
Else" to the sly, Latin-flavored "Variety Is the Spice of Life" with unflagging 
energy. So animated were the performances that it often seemed as if the stage 
itself were moving from side to side in an effort to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of the faster-paced compositions, which constituted about 
three-quarters of the show, ranges from serviceable to extraordinary, the 
latter of which describes the heady "The State I'm In." The song could easily 
slip by undetected on a Prince album as the work of the master himself, though 
it's hard to imagine anyone giving it a more impassioned treatment than its own 
author did Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
A canny expression of 21st-Century Angst, the song's sole failing is an 
obtrusive horn break. Renowned trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie makes an appearance on 
one track on Louie Louie's album, and it's almost as if horn parts were quickly 
tacked on to others so that it wouldn't appear as if Gillespie were recruited 
for his name value alone. 
</P>
<P>
But the evening's most significant clunkers came when the group slowed down the 
pace of the proceedings to allow Louie Louie to try his hand -- and voice -- at 
some generic urban contemporary-style balladry. Clearly, he needs to do more 
homework. Only "Unicorn" displayed any sort of melodic or lyrical imagination. 
</P>
<P>
The nadir came with "Penny Lady," a pathos-laden ode to a homeless woman in 
which Louie Louie offers her not food or shelter but a copy of his album. 
</P>
<P>
That sorry exception aside, however, Louie Louis presented a remarkably 
entertaining hour of radio-ready (critics of the genre might say formulaic) 
contemporary pop music. But a lack of his own distinct musical personality 
might hinder his ability to make the leap from the teen positions on the 
charts, where the sassy "Sittin' in the Lap of Luxury" has already taken him, 
into the upper single-digit spots. 
</P>
<P>
Even if his only goal is to hold title to the most important "Louie Louie" in 
the history of pop music, he faces the formidable task of developing a style to 
rival the impact of garage rock. 
</P>
<P>
Dance diva Nayobe's opening set inadequately displayed her considerable vocal 
talents, marred as it was by a malfunctioning sound system and time constraints 
that limited her to just four songs.

A RESPONSIBLE LESSON IN SEX EDUCATION FOR TEENS AND PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "ABC Afterschool Special" series puts its best foot forward with today's 
outstanding season premiere, "A Question of Sex" (at 3 p.m. on Channels 7, 3, 
10 and 42). 
</P>
<P>
Starring Tracey Gold of "Growing Pains" and sensitively directed by "Top Gun" 
actor Tom Skerritt, the hourlong drama revolves around Shauna, a teen-age girl 
who decides to publicly protest the lack of sex education and counseling for 
teens in her town. 
</P>
<P>
She comes into conflict with the school board and her mother, a board member up 
for re-election. Mom insists that sex education is the parents' responsibility, 
even though she herself can't talk about it to her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Courtney Flavin from a story by Flavin, Beth Thompson and Tracey 
Thompson, the drama addresses parents' concerns, the importance of 
communication and of giving teens the information to make responsible choices. 
It avoids extremes and finds a common-sense compromise, doing so with honesty, 
unusual artistic integrity for a "message show" and a complete lack of 
exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
If the latest Kinsey report is any guide -- suggesting that a majority of adult 
Americans are woefully ignorant about sexual realities -- this straightforward 
hour should be required watching by parents as well as teens. LYNNE HEFFLEY

'FAT' JOKES THE BREAD AND BUTTER OF 'BABES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new Fox comedy series "Babes" is about three rotund sisters. In the 
premiere (at 8:30 tonight on Channels 11 and 6), Darlene (Susan Peretz) and 
Charlene (Wendie Jo Sperber) encourage Marlene (Lesley Boone) to get a job as 
an oversize hosiery model. 
</P>
<P>
The actresses are fine, but "Babes" is not, its few glimmers of real humor 
obliterated by "fat" jokes, one after the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Babes" is pioneering, however. It introduces a new ism to TV comedy. In its 
50-year history, American TV has been guilty of racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, 
ageism and probably other isms as well. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes fatism. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, "Babes" gives lip service to opposing fat bias. Charlene's 
boyfriend finds her sexy. Moreover, brassy Darlene tells self-effacing Marlene, 
"You're a beautiful woman. Don't be ashamed of who you are." And when Marlene 
is called a "porker" by a commercial director, her sisters are outraged. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the entire premise for "Babes" -- its reason for existing, 
it appears -- is that fat is funny. 
</P>
<P>
It's in the sisters' body language. Two express anger by butting people in the 
stomach with their heads a la the Three Stooges. 
</P>
<P>
It's in the jokes. 
</P>
<P>
* When Darlene shows up, Charlene says, "It's either my sister, Darlene, or a 
piece of Sky Lab." 
</P>
<P>
* A secretary tells Marlene when she arrives for an audition, "Take a seat. 
Take as many as you need." 
</P>
<P>
It's in the sight gags. 
</P>
<P>
* When all three sisters sleep in the same bed, it, predictably, collapses. 
</P>
<P>
* Darlene eats cereal for breakfast -- a whole box. 
</P>
<P>
* When Darlene gets up from her chair, it clings to her body. 
</P>
<P>
No, not funny, just gross. HOWARD ROSENBERG

NELSON CONDUCTS BERLIOZ, RAVEL, TCHAIKOVSKY AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning the final week of the summer season at Hollywood Bowl with yet 
another guest conductor, the players of the Los Angeles Philharmonic seemed, 
paradoxically, more relaxed, more malleable and more cooperative than one might 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
For his second Bowl appearance, however, John Nelson made wonderful music 
Tuesday night with our overworked but willing orchestra -- before a crowd 
counted by management at 9,293 listeners. 
</P>
<P>
He elicited from the Philharmonic tight performances, splendid soloism and 
cohesive ensemble playing. 
</P>
<P>
The American conductor, now 48 and a free-lancer tied only to Opera Theatre of 
St. Louis, led an unremarkable program -- Berlioz's "Benvenuto Cellini" 
Overture, Ravel's Piano Concerto in G and Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony -- with 
heat and conviction, as if each of these pieces had suddenly become a matter of 
life and death. 
</P>
<P>
And so they had, apparently. Tchaikovsky's overfamiliar Fifth moved along 
unhurriedly, but with an urgency and thrust few achieve. Its opening and finale 
made their rhetorical points without overstatement or dutifulness, but in all 
seriousness, and with immaculate instrumentalism. 
</P>
<P>
The inner movements became occasions for genuine articulation but no 
grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
And there was no letdown at midprogram, when the brilliant Jean-Yves Thibaudet 
returned to play the Ravel concerto. 
</P>
<P>
At his first appearance in Southern California at a recital at Ambassador 
Auditorium eight years ago, the French pianist performed a Ravel group Albert 
Goldberg called "exquisite." Thibaudet's Ravel continues to earn that 
description. In the G-major concerto, he sculpted every 16th-note, colored 
every phrase to fit within his ideal conception of the piece, and made it all 
seem natural and effortless, as well as thrilling. DANIEL CARIAGA

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: IN THIS WORLD, DOUGHNUTS ARE AN AFTERTHOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The sign over the door reads: "Since 1968." And the photos plastered all over 
the walls of Donut World in Capistrano Beach indeed elicit fond memories of the 
late '60s. 
</P>
<P>
The "decor" is especially nostalgic for surfers who can remember the break at 
Killer Dana and the huge waves that once cascaded down in the now-calm waters 
of Dana Point Marina. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the folks who line up at the counter of this rustic little eatery every 
morning and lunchtime aren't there to examine the photos, however. And most 
order a doughnut (from among the nearly two dozen different varieties 
available) only as an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the breakfast sandwiches are the hot item. Bacon and egg, 
sausage and egg and the standard BLT are handed over hot off the grill on your 
choice of toast. All are priced at $3.10 or under. The bread and fixings are 
fresh and the result is a delicious handful of breakfast to go. 
</P>
<P>
If you've got a few minutes to spare and the appetite, the full-fledged 
breakfast plates are worth the time and effort. There are a few tables inside 
and a few more outside, but when $3.45 will get you two eggs, four pieces of 
bacon, toast and crisp hash browns, seating location is not a prime concern. 
</P>
<P>
Come lunchtime, the special is the popular choice. It includes a killer of a 
cheeseburger, a choice of fries or egg roll -- that's right, egg roll -- and a 
soft drink, all for $3. 
</P>
<P>
 Donut World, 34852 Doheny Park Road, Capistrano Beach. Open Mondays through 
Saturdays 5 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sundays till 3 p.m. (714) 496-2454. JOHN WEYLER

"The Haunting" (1963), directed by Robert Wise. 112 minutes. No rating. 
</P>
<P>
 This ghost story will give you sweaty palms, high blood pressure, just about 
everything a scary movie should, without benefit of fake decapitations and 
gallons of fake blood -- just a plot, some chilling sound effects and superb 
black-and-white photography. Not to mention a cast headed by Julie Harris and 
Claire Bloom. ERIK HAMILTON

"The Crimson Pirate" (1952), directed by Robert Siodmak. 104 minutes. No 
rating. A spoof of all those Errol Flynn pirate movies. 
</P>
<P>
The pirates say "Arrrgh!" a lot and tend to get their peg-legs stuck in the 
grills over the hatches. And this time it's Burt Lancaster who gets to be 
gallant as hell. 
</P>
<P>
"The Third Man" (1949), directed by Carol Reed. 100 minutes. No rating. An 
American comes to postwar Vienna to discover a friend has been murdered, and he 
winds up learning a little about love and loyalty -- too late, alas, to help 
himself. With Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, a script by Graham Greene that is a 
marvel of wit and intelligence, and some great zither music. MIKE FLAGG

The Canyon Inn, 6821 Fairlynn Blvd. (just off Esperanza Road), Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Open weekdays from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. and weekends from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 
779-0880. Anchored in a strip mall, this may well be the "last of the 
neighborhood saloons," as management claims. There's lots of wood, a jukebox 
heavy on classic rock, and help that knows the regulars -- from suits to 
shirt-sleeves types -- by name. RICK VANDERKNYFF

The Doll Hut, 107 S. Adams Ave. (at Manchester Avenue), Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Open Monday through Saturday, 1 p.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 533-1286. Top 40 is 
strictly prohibited, it's too loud and cramped to ever be a pickup joint, and 
its grunge-over-glitz motif is the antithesis of all those peach-stucco and 
neon yuppie hangouts. It's also the best place in O.C. to hear avant-rock, 
drink Guinness and shoot pool. JOHN PENNER

(714) 553-1333. Frazzled after a day on the fast track? Try a glass of Chianti

Currently the only pub in Orange County that makes its own beer on the

Labor Day may have come and gone, but starting Friday, Sept. 14, and continuing 
through Sept. 23, you can stretch your summer fun at the second annual Newport 
SeaFest, two weekends of continuous contests, shows and special events in and 
around Newport Beach. Organized by the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce 
and involving hundreds of volunteers, the festival was designed to boost 
post-season business in the area with a program of events ranging from 
sandcastle competitions to hot-air-balloon races. Most events are geared toward 
families; many are free. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance to get the family out and have a great time while the weather is 
still nice," said Phil Glasgow, SeaFest chairman. Glasgow estimates that more 
than 75,000 sun-lovers will attend the festival's 22 events. 
</P>
<P>
The Corona del Mar area is the hot spot for the opening weekend. At 9 a.m. 
Friday, Sept. 14, some of the country's best water polo teams will gather at 
Corona del Mar High School's Marian Bergeson Aquatic Center for the UCI 
Collegiate Water Polo Tournament. The games continue through Sunday, Sept. 16. 
Admission prices vary. 
</P>
<P>
Gourmets of all ages will appreciate "A Taste of Newport," a three-day food 
fest at Fashion Island. The event, which runs Friday, Sept. 14, from 5 to 10 
p.m., Saturday, Sept. 15, from noon to 10 p.m. and Sunday, Sept. 16, from noon 
to 6 p.m., features delectables from 40 local restaurants and caterers, along 
with nonstop entertainment. (Average White Band headlines Friday, Billy Vera 
and the Beaters appear Saturday, and Latin jazz master Pancho Sanchez performs 
Sunday.) Nibblers pay a $5 admission fee, then purchase $1 tokens redeemable 
for samples from Five Feet Too, Balboa Dessert Company, Newport Landing and 
more. Admission (but not the token) is free Saturday and Sunday, Sept. 15 and 
16, for children 12 and under. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 a.m. on both Saturday, Sept. 15, and Sunday, Sept. 16., 30 rainbow-hued 
ballons will fill the skies in the Newport Hot Air Balloon Spectacular. The 
launching site at the corner of Coast Highway and Newport Center Drive opens at 
6 a.m., giving visitors plenty of time to ogle the balloonists as they prepare 
their craft for the 7:30 takeoff. After the flight, balloonists will return to 
the launch site to mingle with the crowd until 11 a.m. Tethered balloon rides, 
food and entertainment will be available all morning. Admission is $4 for 
adults; children 12 and under are free. The USS Lynde McCormick, a 4,500-ton 
guided missile destroyer to be anchored off Corona del Mar, will be open for 
free tours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sept. 15 and 16 as well. Shuttles will leave 
the parking structure at 610 Newport Center Drive for the Orange County Harbor 
Department, where visitors can catch a 20-minute boat ride out to the ship. The 
last launch departs at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Sept. 16, landlubbers can participate in what Glasgow calls "the 
granddaddy of all sandcastle contests." Held from noon to 3 p.m. near the jetty 
on Corona del Mar State Beach, the contest is open to all ages. 
Pre-registration is required to build. Just a bump, set and a spike away, a 
volleyball competition runs Saturday and Sunday, Sept. 15 and 16, from 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 21, the focus shifts to Newport's harbor and coastline with the 
arrival of the Californian, the state's official tall ship. The Californian, 
along with dozens of antique and contemporary wooden boats, will be moored in 
Newport Harbor and will be open for tours Saturday and Sunday, Sept. 22 and 23, 
as part of SeaFest's Wooden Boat Festival. Activities will include 
boat-building contests for children and adults, demonstrations and lectures. 
Admission is $3 to $5. Also on tap Friday, Sept. 21, is an all-ages fishing 
tournament and the kickoff of the Hyatt Newporter Jazz Festival, which 
continues through that weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Families can help preserve the beauty of the Back Bay at National Estuary 
Day/Clean Harbor Day II, Saturday, Sept 22. Armed with trash bags and goodwill, 
volunteers are invited to meet at the Newport Dunes Aquatic Park at 9 a.m. and 
"clean their way toward the harbor," said Glasgow. Other events that day 
include an around-the-pier swim off Balboa Pier, a windsurfing contest at the 
Ameri 8can Legion Yacht Club and a surfing contest. On Sunday, Sept. 23, you 
can pedal up an appetite in 10- to 100-mile cycle tours of the Bike Classic, 
which begins and ends at the Dunes, then satisfy that growling stomach at the 
Pavilions Chowder Cook-Off, held from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Via Lido Plaza. 
Admission is free to the cook-off; Bike Classic participants must pre-register 
through the chamber. A Kite Festival at the Balboa Pier park provides a 
high-flying finale on Sunday, Sept. 23, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., featuring 
single- and double-line competitions for all age groups, and free kites for 
children 12 and under (while supplies last). 
</P>
<P>
By the way, if you want to make a real summer vacation of it and stay over for 
the festivities, a number of local hotels are offering special SeaFest 
discounts. For a complete calendar of SeaFest activities and to purchase event 
tickets, stop by the SeaFest Information Booth in Fashion Island or call the

DANIELS IS DOWN, NOT OUT IN WIN; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AN INJURY KEEPS HIM FROM STARTING BUT NOT FROM HITTING THREE-RUN 
DOUBLE IN THE EIGHTH INNING TO LEAD DODGERS PAST PADRES, 10-3.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kal Daniels missed a third consecutive start for the Dodgers Wednesday because 
of strained muscle in his left side. But he proved there is more than one side 
to Kal Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth inning of a 3-3 tie with the San Diego Padres, Daniels stepped 
gingerly off the bench and into another Dodger highlight film with a 
bases-loaded, pinch-hit double down the right-field line, leading the Dodgers 
in a 10-3 victory before 16,706 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just down at the end of the bench, shooting the breeze, when they called 
me to hit," Daniels said. "I was wearing my turf shoes, and I didn't even have 
time to put on my cleats. I didn't have time to get loose. I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged and added, "Then I go up there just trying to get a fly ball. I 
guess I got more than that, huh? Maybe it is better to be lucky then good." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels' pained effort saved his teammates from another long look in the 
mirror, after they had blown a 3-0 lead by giving up three Padre runs in the 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are looking toward Cincinnati and another weekend showdown with the 
National League West-leading Reds. 
</P>
<P>
They have moved to within six games of the Reds, who lost to Houston, 3-1, 
Wednesday. But the Dodgers have 19 games left. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like every time we've played the Reds, we've had to sweep them," 
Daniels said. "So what else is new?" 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' eighth inning actually had roots in the fourth, when Daniels said 
that coach Bill Russell asked him if he could hit. Before the game, Daniels had 
taken his first batting practice since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Yeah, I can hit in an emergency,' then I didn't think anything of 
it." said Daniels, who is batting .400 in September with five home runs and 14 
runs batted in despite suffering from a muscle pull since late August. 
</P>
<P>
Four innings later, after the Padres had tied the score off Dodger starter Jim 
Neidlinger and reliever Dave Walsh, the eighth inning began with a one-out 
single by Eddie Murray against reliever Atlee Hammaker. Murray, playing with a 
sore wrist, had already hit a homer and double and scored two runs. 
</P>
<P>
After Murray took second on a balk, Hubie Brooks was intentionally walked and 
Mike Scioscia singled, loading the bases. With right-handed hitting Juan Samuel 
batting, Greg Harris, a right-hander, relieved Hammaker. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda considered this the perfect "emergency" and called 
on Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were Greg Harris, which of those two batters would you rather face?" 
Lasorda said after citing Daniels' team-leading 24 homers with 77 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels lined a 1-and-1 pitch down the first base line, over the bag and into 
right-field corner for three runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers added four runs in the ninth against Eric Show. Jay Howell, 
pitching a scoreless two innings, converted his seventh consecutive save 
opportunity for his 15th save, and the victory went to reliever Tim Crews, who 
faced two batters in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
But what big batters they were. Crews walked Jack Clark to load the bases after 
the Padres had scored three runs, then retired Joe Carter on a fly ball to deep 
center to end the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Crews said he is one Dodger who is not going to visit Riverfront Stadium to 
watch the Reds play Houston tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you kidding me?" he said. "I've got to get away from the park and relax. 
I've been in so many situations with men on bases lately, that's why my hair is 
gray." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, stung by Murray's 23rd homer and RBI singles by Jose Offerman and 
Samuel in the first six innings, rallied with one out in the seventh. After 
Neidlinger had retired 12 consecutive hitters, Fred Lynn singled to center. One 
out later, pinch-hitter Mike Pagliarulo singled to right. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts singled to left for one run. Garry Templeton singled to center for 
another. Against Walsh, Gwynn hit a grounder that bounced off the glove of a 
diving Murray. It ricocheted to second baseman Samuel, who threw high as Murray 
raced back to the bag. 
</P>
<P>
A run scored and runners advanced to second and third before Crews replaced 
Walsh and walked Clark. Then he retired Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
After the game, the Dodgers recalled four more players from triple-A 
Albuquerque: third baseman Dave Hansen, catcher Carlos Hernandez, pitcher John 
Wetteland and infielder Luis Lopez. Albuquerque defeated Edmonton, 2-0, to win 
the Pacific Coast League title. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds will pitch three left-handers at the Dodgers this weekend 
-- Tom Browning, Danny Jackson and Norm Charlton -- and they probably will be 
the Reds' rotation for the playoffs. Even though four of the Dodgers' top five 
power hitters hit better against right-handers -- Kal Daniels, Eddie Murray, 
Kirk Gibson and Mike Scioscia -- the Dodgers are 27-22 against left-handed 
starters. The Dodgers will counter with Fernando Valenzuela, Ramon Martinez and 
Mike Morgan, who has only won once since pitching a two-hitter against the Reds 
July 30. . . . Ray Searage said he will be ready for the Reds series after 
pitching four strong simulated innings. Searage was activated from the disabled 
list Tuesday but wanted one more appearance on the side before entering a 
regular game. He has not pitched since Aug. 14. . . . Mike Hartley was still 
suffering from a sore left side after injuring it in his start here Tuesday. 
Hartley is not scheduled to start again until Tuesday.

BRUINS HOPE THEY HAVE THROWBACK TO AIKMAN; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: MADDOX IS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NOW, BUT HE SHOWS THE POISE OF ANOTHER 6-4 
UCLA QUARTERBACK FROM TEXAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a high school senior in Hurst, Tex., in 1988, Tommy Maddox saw UCLA prepare 
for its Cotton Bowl game against Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
After watching Bruin quarterback Troy Aikman, Maddox said, he decided to come 
to UCLA. He made a recruiting trip to Michigan, but he canceled trips to 
Louisiana State and Brigham Young. He was committed to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox is a redshirt freshman, but he has poise and bearing that is reminiscent 
of Aikman. Both quarterbacks came out of the Southwest, Aikman from Oklahoma 
and Maddox from Texas. They're each 6 feet 4, with strong arms. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman has established his credentials with the Dallas Cowboys after being the 
first player chosen in the 1989 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox is beginning his college career, playing for the first time in the 
second half of last Saturday's game against Oklahoma at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I did some good things and I made some mistakes," Maddox said of his 
eight-of-16 passing performance for 106 yards with two interceptions. "But 
everyone has to get out there for the first time, and I got through that. I 
think I proved to myself and some other people that I can play on this level." 
</P>
<P>
Firmly believing that there is no substitute for game experience, Maddox added: 
"You can learn more in three plays on the field than watching the whole game on 
the sideline. On the sideline, You don't have five guys rushing around trying 
to kill you." 
</P>
<P>
Although Jim Bonds was named the starting quarterback for Saturday's game 
against Stanford at the Rose Bowl, Maddox figures to get plenty of playing time 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody likes to start, and I'm not any different," Maddox said. "However, 
that's out of my hands. All I can do is go out to practice and improve every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Maddox was an all-around athlete at L.D. Bell High School. As a senior, he 
passed for 2,601 yards and 18 touchdowns. He was also a guard on the basketball 
team, averaging 35.8 points in his senior year, and pitched and played first 
base for the baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
He left as the school's all-time passer in football and all-time scorer in 
basketball. However, he faded from the spotlight last year as a quarterback on 
UCLA's scout team. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming out of high school, you're used to getting attention," Maddox said. 
"Then, you're on the scout team, and if you missed practice, no one would know 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough, but it gives you a chance to find yourself. You've reached one 
of your goals in life just getting to college." 
</P>
<P>
Maddox, 19 this month, took his year of apprenticeship in stride and said he 
had fun in. "You've got to enjoy anything you do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he may not be aware of it, Maddox has a nickname in his new 
environment: "Fly." 
</P>
<P>
Homer Smith, UCLA's offensive coordinator, inadvertently supplied it when asked 
a few weeks ago whether Bret Johnson would have been the No. 2 quarterback if 
he hadn't left school. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Smith said cautiously, "but there's a fly in the ointment: Tommy Maddox. 
He's still green, but he does things that I marvel at. He's a very talented 
young man. He has the quickest arm on the team and he's the tallest and he 
throws tall." 
</P>
<P>
Maddox moved up on the depth chart when Johnson left for Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised," Maddox said of Johnson's decision. "Everybody on the team 
had it in the back of their minds that if he doesn't start he's going to leave. 
I can't blame him. I can't blame anyone for wanting to play." 
</P>
<P>
Maddox should feel at home at UCLA because there are 15 Texans on the team. 
However, his choice of schools didn't endear him to the folks at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people in Texas are still pretty hot about that," Maddox said of his 
decision to play for UCLA, "but I didn't want to play in the Southwest 
Conference." 
</P>
<P>
He said his decision was partly based on NCAA sanctions involving Southwest 
Conference schools. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Mark, was a quarterback at Southern Methodist when the football 
program was temporarily curtailed by NCAA sanctions. Mark then transferred to 
Texas Christian, where he played baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark was the best recruiter UCLA had," Tommy Maddox said of his brother. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds is a junior, so Maddox is probably the No. 1 quarterback of the future -- 
if not sooner. 
</P>
<P>
And he's upbeat about the season, despite the 34-14 loss to Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after the game, the team was upset because it wanted so badly to turn 
things around from last year," Maddox said. "But we've had good practices, and 
the spirit was back on the team. I think you'll see a different team this 
Saturday."

When you've broken every significant record, become the greatest player in the 
history of your sport and led your team to a decade of dominance, all before 
your 30th birthday, there wouldn't seem to be too much left open to question. 
</P>

But at 29, Wayne Gretzky finds whispers and rumors swirling about him on the 
eve of his 12th National Hockey League season. Such as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has begun to skate on the downside of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He will never win a Stanley Cup for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The back injury he suffered at last season's end could linger. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He is the team's de facto general manager, making the key decisions with 
owner Bruce McNall while Rogie Vachon serves as a figurehead. 
</P>
<P>
Here for the Kings' training camp, Gretzky sat down with reporters to comment 
on these and other subjects, including drug revelations concerning his former 
team, the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Let's start with the question you must have been asked a thousand 
times this summer: How's your back? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The doctors have told me it's fine. It's just a matter of building the 
strength up. I've been doing a lot of sit-ups. If I worry about it, I think 
that's when you get hit and get hurt. In scrimmages, I've been getting some 
hits. Not heavy hits, just body contact, and it's been holding up fine. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Were you ever worried that it was a career-threatening injury? 
</P>
<P>
A: Before the first test, yeah, I was worried because if it was my disk, then 
you're talking career-threatening. But when they said it was my muscles, I 
wasn't worried, because then, it's a matter of time and strengthening them. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did doctors give you any advice on keeping your back sound? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yeah, they told me to stay out of the corners and I'd be fine. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In your two years in Los Angeles, the Kings have yet to win a second-round 
playoff game. Is the organization really any closer to a Stanley Cup? 
</P>
<P>
A: Rome wasn't built in a night. Looking at the hockey team now compared to 
when I first came here, it's night and day. I remember first stepping on the 
ice with the Kings, coming from a Stanley Cup champion, and thinking, 'whoa, 
we've got a long way to go here.' Their minor league team was older than our 
team, all 30-, 31-, 32-year-olds. That's not how you build a minor league 
system. Now they've gone outside and signed as many 21-, 22-year-olds as they 
can. There's some direction from (Coach) Tommy (Webster), Rogie and Bruce. 
That's been so positive. We're getting more depth. It just makes it more fun. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But not as much fun as it was last season in Edmonton, where your old team, 
the Oilers, returned to the top two years after trading you. Was it tough to 
sit in Los Angeles and watch your former teammates win their first Cup without 
you? 
</P>
<P>
A: Oh no, that doesn't bother me at all. Because I played with those guys, I 
know how good they are. The only thing I'm disappointed in is that we weren't 
there. They played well. They deserved to win. I was hoping they'd win. First 
of all, they're my friends. I have absolutely no ill feelings toward them. 
Second of all, they're the team that knocked us out. And thirdly, it's our 
division. For years, we've been trying to gain respect for our division. It was 
my off-season, and I didn't want to get in front of the TV to watch every game. 
I'll admit that. But I watched one in Paris at 2 in the morning and I watched 
the final game in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The Oilers have a new challenge to overcome with the recent story in the 
Edmonton Journal that goalie Grant Fuhr was a cocaine user for seven years 
before entering a rehabilitation center last summer. Did you know about that? 
</P>
<P>
A: (The Oilers) are good people. They don't deserve that. I never saw it. You 
always hear different reports, but you believe nothing of what you hear and 
half of what you see. It just amazes me that it did go on, because (Fuhr) 
figured in most of our wins. He played so well. A lot of people are taking 
shots at (General Manager) Glen (Sather). I know Glen has sent players through 
rehab. He's taken care of them as far as getting help (goes), put them in rehab 
and paid for it. I know two or three guys he helped, and I'm talking before Cup 
winners. To say that he didn't care and it's his fault Grant is in this 
situation, that's not fair to Glen. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What should the league do about it? 
</P>
<P>
A: The policy of the president (John Ziegler) is that he doesn't believe there 
is a drug problem in the NHL. If he takes a stand that you can get help, that 
there is a rehab program, I guess that's like saying we do have a problem. 
Drugs won't be tolerated. Therefore, there is no rehab program. If you do it, 
you're out of hockey. It's plain and simple. I think, in general, it's out of 
the game, but let me tell you, it's everywhere in society. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you agree with Ziegler's policy? 
</P>
<P>
A: I agree with him in a lot of ways, but I think in the next Players' 
Association agreement, something is going to have to be done. If there are 
players out there that need help, better to save them than have them mess up 
their lives. I don't know how many players are in that situation. I can't 
comprehend being able to skate while on a substance. Skating alone is an art. 
Doing it on a substance? I don't know. That's got to be tough. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In your just-published book, 'Gretzky: An Autobiography,' you talk bitterly 
about the harsh treatment you received in your hometown, Brantford, from some 
of the parents of your teammates when you were a kid -- the jealousies that 
surfaced when, at age 10, you had already become a dominant player. Was that a 
catharsis for you, a venting of feelings you had long kept pent up? 
</P>
<P>
A: I have absolutely no complaints about my life. But people think I got handed 
everything, all this kind of fell in my lap, that I was just God-gifted with 
all this talent. I wanted people to realize it's a lot tougher than just waking 
up one day and you're in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you feel you missed anything in your childhood? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't think I missed anything as far as fun, friends and that sort of 
thing. But I moved away from home when I was 13. I have a little brother 
(Brent) I hardly know. He's almost 18 years old now. When I left home, he was 
3. I wouldn't say I'm bitter, but I'm not really excited the way it turned out. 
I moved an hour away from home just to get away from the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Any advice for kids today facing that kind of pressure? 
</P>
<P>
A: I get a lot of parents coming up to me, telling me they are grooming their 
kids to be professional athletes. I'm really against that. I think it's a great 
life, and yeah, you can lead them in that direction. But I think a lot of 
parents live their lives through the kids. Because they didn't make it, they 
want their kids to make it. It puts a lot of undue pressure on the kids. For 
everyone that makes it, nine or 10 quit when they're 16, 17. I was reading 
about the USC quarterback (Todd Marinovich) who was groomed to the point where 
he couldn't eat cake at birthday parties. I think sports for kids is the 
greatest thing in the world because it teaches you how to share, about winning 
and losing and pressure. But I don't think you should force your kid to become 
a professional athlete. Q: How about your own son, Ty, born earlier this 
summer? He'll have some pretty big skates to fill. 
</P>
<P>
A: If he wants to play hockey, great, I'll take him to the rink. If he wants to 
play baseball, great. Same thing if my daughter (21-month-old Paulina) wants to 
play. But I'm not going to let them live and die it. Schooling is important, 
family is important and a lot of other things. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In your book, you talk about people always predicting it was just a matter 
of time until you tumbled from your pedestal. When you were 10, they said it 
would happen by the time you were 12. . . . This past year, the stories began 
that you have passed your prime, that the Great One has become the Average One. 
Is it starting all over again? 
</P>
<P>
A: It never ended. It becomes almost funny. People in general want to build 
somebody up and then try to knock them down. They always root for the underdog. 
When I came in the league, Guy Lafleur and Marcel Dionne were the two who 
carried the league. And everybody rooted for me to beat them and win a scoring 
title. But after I won two or three in a row, people couldn't wait for the next 
guy to come along and knock me down. And now, there's Mario (Lemieux). I told 
him, there's going to come a point in time when people are going to start 
saying some other guy is better. It's already started. People are waiting for 
(Eric) Lindros to knock Lemieux down. That's what makes sports go. To say I'm 
washed up, I'm probably the only guy in hockey who can win a scoring title and 
everybody is saying I had a bad year. I don't worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Not at all? 
</P>
<P>
A: It doesn't bother me, but it motivates me. No question about that. I get 
hungry to prove people wrong. But my whole life, I've always been in the 
situation where if the team wins, I'm going to take the roses. Oh, Gretzky 
played so well. But if the team loses, I'm on the other side of the road. 
Gretzky played awful. That's what happened last year. We didn't have a very 
good year, and I take the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you feel you're still playing as well as ever? 
</P>
<P>
A: I feel my game changed the last two years simply because I went from playing 
with two All-Stars (Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen) to a lot of different people. 
Nothing against those people, but it's not easy to play with me. We were 
changing and changing and changing. A lot of it had to do with the fact the 
club didn't want to break up (Luc) Robitaille and (Bernie) Nicholls and others. 
That was important to the team. So I played with guys from the minor leagues. I 
played with everybody. But that was fine. I understood that. Now, I'm real 
excited about playing with Tony (Granato) and Tommy (Sandstrom). 
</P>
<P>
Q: Almost since you arrived in Los Angeles, there have been stories that you 
make the key personnel decisions on the team in conjunction with McNall, that 
Vachon is the general manager in name only. Those whispers grew after last 
year's trade of Nicholls. Your reaction? 
</P>
<P>
A: I really get frustrated by it. In Edmonton, as much as my teammates came to 
me and asked me for advice on things and wanted me to communicate with 
management, they knew I was a player. That's the way I am here. I have to go to 
work with these guys every day. I need Marty (McSorley) and Jay (Miller) behind 
me. I don't want those guys to think I'm the one saying, 'Trade that guy, trade 
that guy.' That's not right. If they ask me for advice on different players I 
played with or against, I tell them automatically. If I know the players as 
individuals, if I think they're a winner or a loser, if I think they care, I 
say so. But beyond that, I don't go to Rogie and say, 'You've got to trade this 
guy.' That's absolutely asinine. Part of the problem is that Rogie keeps a low 
profile. Players sometimes think they can take advantage of him because he is 
low-key. That's the misconception. He's quiet, but he can be stern. Tommy and 
Rogie are my bosses. They make the decisions. I have enough to worry about 
playing hockey without worrying about who is going to play on the minor league 
team and all the other things. My brother (Keith) was a free agent and he 
didn't get offered a contract anywhere. . . . That doesn't mean I'm not friends 
with Bruce. He changed my whole life. But I also know he's my boss, and I would 
never embarrass him or try to disappoint him. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But is it not reasonable to assume that if King management was about to 
trade Nicholls for Granato and Sandstrom, two guys that would skate on your 
line, they would first consult you? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yeah, it is. If we don't win, my neck is in the noose. So when they ask me 
about things, I can either be quiet, turn my cheek the other way and maybe 
never win, or I can step forward and say, 'Hey, this guy can play,' or, 'That 
guy can't play.' One of my best friends on the team was Bernie. . . . We were 
good companions. Having said all that, I still believe it was a good trade. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When will your playing days be over? 
</P>
<P>
A: I hope to play another six years. I'll be 35 years old at that time. That'll 
be 18 years as a pro for me. . . . Of course, if I get 190 points when I'm 35 
and we win 50 games, I'm sure I'll play more. It's hard to walk away when it's 
been your whole life and then, all of a sudden, it's over.

2 LOYOLA BASEBALL PLAYERS HURT IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball players Tim Williams and Darren Sugiyama of Loyola Marymount were 
injured Saturday night in a drive-by shooting incident. The two, along with 
teammate Todd Gates, were driving west on Manchester Avenue from the 
Westchester campus toward Williams' apartment in Playa del Rey shortly before 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said a car began tailgating them, and when Sugiyama changed lanes to 
let the car pass, it pulled alongside the passenger side and a shotgun blast 
was fired into a side window. 
</P>
<P>
None of the players were hit by the pellets. Williams, a senior all-conference 
outfielder and one of the team's top pro prospects, was in the back seat and 
was struck by glass from an exploding window. He suffered serious injury to his 
right eye and needed emergency surgery to remove shattered glass. The right 
lens of his eye also was removed, but can be replaced as an implant after some 
healing. 
</P>
<P>
Sugiyama, a sophomore infielder from Long Beach, suffered cuts around the neck. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, a sophomore outfielder from Framingham, Mass., was not injured and was 
able to get to a phone and call for help quickly. The players were taken to 
nearby Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, where Williams had surgery at 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting is being investigated by police, but there are few leads. Williams 
described the assailants as three white males and a white female in a blue 
Blazer or Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, an Inglewood resident who was a CIF player of the year at Playa del 
Rey St. Bernard High School, was released from the hospital Tuesday. A CAT scan 
revealed no glass remaining after surgery. He said he hopes to return to 
classes next week, but he will probably miss fall baseball practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are blurry but clearing up," Williams said Wednesday.

O'MALLEY: WILL TRY TO HELP RAIDERS, TROJANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although football has never been staged at Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers would 
consider the Raiders and USC as short-term tenants under certain conditions, 
team President Peter O'Malley said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Coliseum is being remodeled and the two teams that play there need a 
place to go, we'd consider it if it didn't disrupt the baseball season," 
O'Malley said from Pittsburgh, where he is attending the baseball owners' 
meetings. "Scheduling would be the key to this." 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley delivered a statement Wednesday, saying if Mayor Bradley asks the 
Dodgers to accommodate either football team, the Dodgers would try to help. 
That could come in the fall of 1992, depending on the reconstruction of the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the Dodgers' assurance was given before Tuesday's announcement the 
Raiders would stay in Los Angeles, provided the Coliseum undergoes substantial 
renovation and the stadium's private managers live up to the terms of an 
undisclosed agreement. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley, a member of the board of directors of the L.A.-based Amateur Athletic 
Foundation, has been a long-standing supporter of the Southland athletic 
community. He has close associations with those involved in the agreement that 
will keep the Raiders here. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders and USC welcomed O'Malley's statement but said it is premature to 
discuss where they might play in 1992. Also being considered are the Rose Bowl 
and Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley said neither the Raiders nor USC has contacted the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Mike McGee, USC athletic director, said the school wants to investigate all 
situations before discussing any proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter has always been a community-minded person," said Al LaCosale, the 
Raiders' administrative executive. "I think everyone appreciates the statement 
he made. But where we might play in 1992 is something for down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Although football has never been held in Dodger Stadium, Bob Smith, director of 
stadium operations, said the facility could accommodate the game. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s Dodger officials laid out a football field, "just to see if it 
would fit," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't be easy, but it could be done," he said. "It would probably entail 
moving the outfield fences back." The football field would stretch from home 
plate to straightaway center field. "I think it would look good for the 
viewer," Smith said. "The left and right sidelines would be good seats." 
</P>
<P>
He said the football stadium would hold about 50,000, which could present a 
problem for USC. The Trojans will play Notre Dame at home in 1992. That game 
has drawn more than 90,000 at the Coliseum in past seasons.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S HOME SWEET HOME AGAIN AS METS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Pirates learned Wednesday night what everybody in the National 
League is increasingly aware of: 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets are two different teams. There is the road version, which has 
trouble beating anybody. And there is the home version, which is virtually 
unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
David Cone survived a wild spell in the third inning Wednesday night to pitch a 
three-hitter and help the Mets beat the Pirates, 2-1. In winning their 10th in 
a row at Shea Stadium, the Mets improved baseball's best home record to 49-22. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets cut the Pirates' lead in the East to 2 1/2 games and set the stage for 
a big game tonight. It will be Doug Drabek (19-5) for the Pirates against 
Dwight Gooden (16-6). 
</P>
<P>
The three wins in a row at home are a turnabout from the Mets' recent trip. On 
that trip, they lost all three games at Pittsburgh, scoring two runs, and were 
2-6 overall, and fell out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
The most glaring problem on the road for the Mets was their inability to hit 
left-handed pitching. 
</P>
<P>
And they didn't seem as if they had solved that problem against John Smiley 
(8-9) Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But a walk, a single and Dave Magadan's double to right-center gave the Mets a 
2-0 lead before Smiley got his first out. 
</P>
<P>
Cone struck out four of the first seven batters before Smiley singled in the 
third for the first Pirate hit. Then, with two out, Cone lost control, walking 
Jay Bell and Andy Van Slyke. On a 3-and-2 count, Bobby Bonilla, after fouling 
off two pitches outside the strike zone, walked to force in the run. 
</P>
<P>
But Barry Bonds took Cone off the hook. The first pitch was low and inside. 
Then Bonds went after the next one, which may have been ball two, and popped to 
short. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 8, Atlanta 3 -- Matt Williams hit a three-run home run in the 
first inning at San Francisco to send the Giants on the way to their fifth 
victory in a row. The victory left the Giants tied for second place with the 
Dodgers, six games back in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
The home run was the 30th for the third baseman and helped John Burkett (12-7) 
end a string of seven winless starts. Burkett left with two out in the eighth 
inning, after rookie Dave Justice hit his 24th home run. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, 11-2 against the Braves, are 6-0 against them at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
It may have been a costly victory for San Francisco. In the fourth inning, 
Kevin Mitchell left with a hyper-extended left knee. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 3, Cincinnati 1 -- Bill Doran, the Reds' first batter, homered, but 
that was the end of their scoring at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the ninth, Ken Caminiti looped a single to left for the third 
hit off Jose Rijo and it drove in the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
In the 13th inning, Mike Simms' first major league hit knocked in the go-ahead 
run. He scored another on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 9, Philadelphia 3 -- Ryne Sandberg may not consider himself a home-run 
hitter, but the pitchers do. 
</P>
<P>
After the Cubs, who scored 10 runs in an inning Tuesday, had a six-run first 
inning at Chicago, Sandberg unloaded in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second baseman's 34th home run to tie the Giants' Mitchell for the 
league lead. Sandberg has hit 64 homers in the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The first seven Cubs reached base against starter Jose DeJesus. The big blow 
was a two-run single by Andre Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning the night before, the Cubs had 10 runs before a batter was 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, St. Louis 2 -- Oil Can Boyd (10-5) has been saying that he is a 
better pitcher than ever this season. He seems to be proving it, too. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd gave up two runs and five hits in seven innings at Montreal to win his 
third in a row. The right-hander has lost only two of his last 17 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Delino DeShields drove in four runs and hit his fourth home run to lead 
the Expos' assault on Bob Tewksbury (10-6). The third loss in a row eliminated 
the Cardinals from the race. DAN HAFNER

BODDICKER CAPS DAY OF BOSTON GOOD NEWS

<P>
After two weeks of almost daily bad news, the good news came in bunches for the 
Boston Red Sox Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The best was that Roger Clemens' shoulder injury is not serious and he can 
start throwing again. Clemens may be ready to start in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Also, bullpen star Jeff Reardon, who underwent disk surgery Aug. 4, pitched in 
the bullpen and was restored to the roster. 
</P>
<P>
And Mike Boddicker pitched a six-hitter against the Milwaukee Brewers, the Red 
Sox getting 13 hits in a 6-1 victory. The Brewers had hammered Boddicker in 
three previous starts in which the Red Sox were beaten, 18-0, 5-0 and 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I called my father-in-law (in Cedar Rapids, Iowa) today and he took the hex 
off me, the Milwaukee hex," Boddicker said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
"I called him on April 1 and told him as an April Fool's joke that I had been 
traded to Milwaukee. He got on the phone and called everybody he knew. I called 
him again about four hours later and he said, 'You're gonna pay for this.' He 
put the curse on me and I got blasted every time I played them." 
</P>
<P>
In a fitting climax, the Red Sox improved their lead in the American League 
East to four games over Toronto, which lost to Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Boddicker (15-8) pitched the Red Sox to only their fourth victory in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Boston has had trouble scoring runs. Ellis Burks, Carlos Quintana and Wade 
Boggs remedied that against one of the league's better pitchers, Teddy Higuera 
(10-7). 
</P>
<P>
Burks and Quintana each had three hits and Boggs two. They drove in four runs 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors reported no ligament damage in the shoulder Clemens (20-5) hurt in a 
game against the Oakland Athletics on Sept. 5. They also said the swelling had 
gone down. He will accompany the team on a 10-game trip that begins at Chicago 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Reardon, who has 18 saves, was not expected to make it back this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I can help this club," Reardon said. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 9, Seattle 3 -- Befitting a trip on which they all but wrapped up their 
third consecutive division title, the Athletics trotted out their best road 
pitcher to complete it. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sanderson (16-9), buoyed by a five-run sixth inning, pitched six innings 
and improved his record away from Oakland to 11-3 and give the A's an 8-1 mark 
on a trip that began with them leading the West by 5 1/2 games. They returned 
home with a 11-game lead and 20 games to play. 
</P>
<P>
After hitting four home runs on the trip, Mark McGwire was given the day off. 
In his place at first base, they unveiled another potential power hitter, Dann 
Howitt. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 3-3, Howitt triggered the five-run inning when he tripled 
into the gap in right-center field to drive in the tiebreaking run. Terry 
Steinbach doubled in two runs later in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"My first major league hit was meaningful and that's good," said Howitt, a 
26-year-old former Cal State Fullerton star. "It was a good time to get it, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson was 3-0 on the trip, winning in Boston and New York, too. 
</P>
<P>
"When our offense gets nine runs like today, I don't think there's any need to 
make a big deal of our starting pitching," Sanderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Griffeys, father and son, provided the Mariners' offense. Ken Sr. walked in 
the first inning and his son hit his 19th home run. In the fifth Ken Sr. 
singled in the other run. 
</P>
<P>
The A's were 5-1 in the Kingdome and won the season series with Seattle, 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 7, Toronto 5 -- On the day that Manager John Wathan's contract was 
extended, the Royals ended their nine-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson hit a tremendous three-run home run, his 24th of the season, and 
George Brett went four for four, including two triples, for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Davis, who led the majors with 44 saves last season but has been a 
disappointment for the Royals, pitched two scoreless innings, striking out two, 
for his first save since May 7 and only his sixth this season. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's home run landed beside the televison camera in center field, far over 
the fence. 
</P>
<P>
Brett, who talked about retirement early in the season, pulled into a virtual 
tie with Oakland's Rickey Henderson for the batting lead. Brett is batting 
.3266, Henderson .3272. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 12, Chicago 2 -- Brook Jacoby and Alex Cole each had four of the 
Indians' 17 hits at Cleveland in handing the White Sox their sixth loss in 
seven games. 
</P>
<P>
The attack enabled Bud Black (11-10) to win for the first time in more than a 
month. He gave up eight hits in seven innings but didn't walk a batter and 
struck out eight. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 2, Detroit 1 -- Jack Morris, twice a 20-game winner, is getting 
closer to 20 defeats. He had a two-hitter and a 1-0 lead going into the eighth 
at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
But Jeff McKnight, one for 20, hit his first major league home run and later in 
the inning Cal Ripken singled in the winning run with a smash off shortstop 
Alan Trammell's glove with two out and the bases loaded. Until the hit Ripken 
was four for 25 with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Morris is 11-18, although he has pitched nine complete games, most in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 5, New York 4 -- It was anything but an auspicious major league debut for 
Yankee pitcher Steve Adkins at New York. 
</P>
<P>
He lasted 1 1/3 wild innings without giving up a hit, but walking eight. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Maas hit his 17th home run and Hensley Meulens hit his first for the 
Yankees. DAN HAFNER

What's in a name? Plenty, if you happen to be Roman Zubinsky Phifer, UCLA's 
outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Phifer said he believed for several years that his middle name was given to him 
because his father had a wartime buddy in Germany named Zubinsky. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't learn until last year from my mother that they got the name Zubinsky 
out of a phone book," Phifer said. 
</P>
<P>
As for his first name, he acknowledged that he's the namesake of Roman Gabriel, 
the former Ram and Philadelphia Eagle quarterback who grew up in North 
Carolina, as did Phifer. 
</P>
<P>
Phifer, who was suspended from school last fall for an off-campus altercation, 
had a career-high 13 tackles, including three behind the line of scrimmage, in 
the 34-14 loss to Oklahoma Saturday. MAL FLORENCE

FLORIDA STATE MAY DECIDE BY NEXT WEEK

Florida State University President Bernard Sliger said Wednesday he hopes to 
announce the school's decision on moving to a new conference by the middle of 
next week, well ahead of a school-established timetable that allowed to the end 
of September. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Herald reported Wednesday that Florida State is only waiting to be 
invited by the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Southeastern Conference has also been lobbying Florida State, but the ACC 
package is more lucrative, Sliger confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Sliger said that no decision could be announced until the options are presented 
to the school's athletic board. That is expected today and a decision is 
expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State presently competes in the Metro Conference in all sports but 
football. The Seminoles are independent in football. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State could be competing in most sports by next year, although it would 
take several years before the school could play a full conference schedule in 
football.

DETMER HAD PLENTY OF HELP IN TAKING WIND OUT OF HURRICANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five more reasons (other than quarterback Ty Detmer) why Brigham Young beat 
former No. 1-ranked Miami: 
</P>
<P>
(1) Defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougar defense is usually as thin as the mountain air in Provo, Utah. But 
last Saturday against Miami, BYU didn't allow a touchdown pass, caused two 
turnovers, intercepted a pass, recorded three sacks and stopped the Hurricanes 
on two crucial second-half, fourth-down plays. In past seasons, short 
fourth-down attempts were gimmes for BYU opponents. So sure was the outcome 
that the Cougar offense, including Detmer, wouldn't bother budging from the 
bench on fourth-down stands. No more. "Last year I wouldn't even have gotten 
excited about it," he said. "But this year our defense is really playing well. 
They shut (Miami) down and gave us good field position all day." 
</P>
<P>
(2) Earl Kauffman. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars' triple threat punted four times and averaged 53.8 yards per kick. 
Of his six kickoffs, five sailed out of the end zone and the other one wasn't 
returned. He also had field goals of 32 and 29 yards, as well as two extra 
points. 
</P>
<P>
(3) The Big Mouth Factor. 
</P>
<P>
After several Hurricane players participated in some mid-week verbal bashing of 
BYU, Miami Coach Dennis Erickson ordered all lips zipped. Too late. The Cougars 
used the comments for added inspiration. Truth be known, Erickson was scared 
stiff of BYU's potential. On the eve of the game, which was Miami's season 
opener, he told Miami Herald columnist Edwin Pope that the Cougars were the 
most underrated team in the country. He was right. 
</P>
<P>
(4) Miami defensive tackle Russell Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland, Miami's best defensive player, was neutralized most of the evening by 
Detmer's scrambling and BYU's massive offensive line. In fact, said Maryland, 
BYU rarely double-teamed him the entire game, a surprising tactic, considering 
Maryland's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
(5) The Altitude. 
</P>
<P>
Provo's elevation, nearly a mile high, seemed to wear down the Hurricanes. 
"Defensively, they weren't coming real hard," BYU running back Mike Salido 
said. "I saw them bent over or with their hands on their hips. They didn't 
really come to play, not after they saw a bunch of balls flying around. I even 
think we could have run on them all night." 
</P>
<P>
Since we're on this list kick, three auxiliary reasons why BYU might somehow 
sneak away with another national championship: 
</P>
<P>
(1) The publicity generated from Detmer's Heisman run will keep BYU planted 
firmly in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
(2) Of the Cougars' 10 remaining regular-season games, only Oregon, Colorado 
State, Wyoming and Hawaii offer legitimate concern. 
</P>
<P>
(3) If the defense is for real, BYU could beat anyone. 
</P>
<P>
And in case you're wondering, a perfect record means BYU must play in the 
Holiday Bowl, which provides an automatic bid to the winner of the Western 
Athletic Conference. The contract is ironclad. 
</P>
<P>
The Holiday Bowl projects a payout of $1.2 million per team, which is 
considerably less than checks written by the Orange Bowl ($4.1 million per 
team), Sugar Bowl ($3.2 million), Cotton Bowl ($2.9 million) or Fiesta Bowl 
($2.25 million) in 1989. If BYU is able to finish its schedule without a loss 
and climb atop the polls, it will be interesting to see potential opponents 
choose between a chance at No. 1 or a bigger bowl payday. In 1984, Holiday Bowl 
officials expected teams to stand in line for the chance to play undefeated 
BYU. They were disappointed and eventually had to settle for Michigan, which 
was 6-5 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun to do a little pie-in-the-sky guessing," said John Reid, executive 
director of the Holiday Bowl. "But this is very similar to what happened in 
'84. There's a long season to play, obviously. But we might change our sights a 
little bit. It's just that you can't set your sights too high. You have to 
temper it." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's convincing 20-7 victory over Clemson did more than end a 29-game 
losing streak to the Tigers. Barring a collapse by Virginia, it all but ensures 
the Cavaliers an Atlantic Coast Conference championship, their second in as 
many years. This isn't the strongest of conferences. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also makes Virginia Coach George Welsh the hottest commodity in 
college football. In eight seasons, he has become the school's winningest 
coach, which tells you all you need to know about past Virginia teams. Look for 
Welsh's name to start appearing on the wish lists of athletic directors and 
maybe some NFL general managers. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly enough, Virginia's strongest competition for the ACC title might 
come from Maryland, which is 2-0 after upsetting 25th-ranked West Virginia in 
Morgantown. The Terrapins won only three games in 1989. Virginia and Maryland 
meet in the final regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
There are better jobs to have than the ones held by Alabama Coach Gene 
Stallings and Clemson's Ken Hatfield. Stallings, who replaced Bill Curry during 
the off-season, watched the Crimson Tide begin its season with a 27-24 loss to 
Southern Mississippi, the same team that defeated Florida State in its 1989 
opener. Adding to Stallings' misery was the loss of star running back Siran 
Stacy, who injured his knee during the game and is out for the season. Alabama 
followers, not known as the most patient fans in college football, are 
reportedly in mourning. They don't take losses well. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield followed the immensely popular Danny Ford, who was eased out after 
rules improprieties were uncovered in the football program. The deeply 
religious Hatfield asked his players to refrain from drinking beer or other 
alcoholic beverages until season's end. He also doesn't allow swearing on the 
field. After the loss to Virginia, it's safe to assume that both of those rules 
were probably broken. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Clemson faces surprising Maryland at College Park, and Alabama plays 
very talented Florida. Losses could make things very sticky for Hatfield and 
Stallings. 
</P>
<P>
A strange weekend for Southern Methodist. First, the Mustangs beat Vanderbilt, 
44-7, the largest margin of victory ever recorded for a Southwest Conference 
school over a Southeastern Conference team. It was SMU's first victory over a 
Division I-A opponent since 1986. The Mustangs didn't punt during last week's 
game. They gained 233 yards rushing, a total that took them six games to reach 
in 1989. And SMU quarterback Mike Romo, a sophomore, threw six touchdown 
passes. In 12 games, Romo has set eight school records, tied one and surpassed 
Don Meredith as SMU's No. 5 career passing leader. 
</P>
<P>
Then came news on Sunday that Atlanta Falcon Coach Jerry Glanville was sending 
a game ball to the Mustangs. The Falcons defeated the Houston Oilers, the same 
team that fired Glanville and hired former University of Houston coach Jack 
Pardee as a replacement. Pardee's team had humiliated an undermanned SMU squad 
last year, 95-21. This was Glanville's pay-back. 
</P>
<P>
Said SMU Coach Forrest Gregg of the gesture: "It's Jerry's game ball and he can 
do what he wants with it. On behalf of the entire SMU team, I accept his 
gracious gift." 
</P>
<P>
Gregg may get another gift this Saturday. The Mustangs play a so-so Tulane 
team. 
</P>
<P>
The Western Athletic Conference shouldn't be confused with the SEC just yet, 
but WAC teams won five of nine games last week: BYU over Miami, Utah over 
Minnesota at Minneapolis, Wyoming over Washington State at Pullman, Air Force 
over Hawaii and Colorado State big over Montana State. . . . The SEC has lost 
its top two running backs: Tennessee's Chuck Webb and Alabama's Stacy. . . . As 
promised by Colorado Coach Bill McCartney, Mike Pritchard, who rushed for 217 
yards against Tennessee in the Pigskin Classic, was back at wide receiver 
against Stanford. Back at halfback was Eric Bieniemy, who missed the Tennessee 
game for disciplinary reasons. Bieniemy had 149 yards against Stanford, 121 in 
the second half. He also scored the game-winning touchdown with 12 seconds 
remaining. . . . Texas owes its 17-13 upset of Penn State to walk-on kicker 
Michael Pollak, who made three field goals. Pollak, a junior, earned a 
scholarship last spring but had not attempted a field goal for Texas until last 
Saturday. In two seasons, he had three kickoffs to his credit. 
</P>
<P>
Our Top 10: (1) Auburn, (2) Florida State, (3) Notre Dame, (4) BYU, (5) 
Virginia, (6) USC, (7) Tennessee, (8) Colorado, (9) Michigan, (10) Texas

BEST PAL STAMPS HIMSELF CALIFORNIA'S BEST WITH EASY VICTORY IN FUTURITY

<TEXT>
<P>
With his decisive victory in Wednesday's $344,100 Del Mar Futurity, Best Pal 
has stamped himself California's best 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the gelded son of Habitony will take on the cream of the East in 
the $1-million Breeders' Cup Juvenile Oct. 27 at Belmont Park remains to be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
Best Pal, who defeated 17-1 shot Pillaring by 3 1/2 lengths in 1:35 2/5, then 
survived foul claims by jockeys Eddie Delahoussaye and Rafael Meza, isn't 
eligible to the Breeders' Cup. He would have to be supplemented for $120,000, 
and owner John Mabee isn't ready to commit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early," said the man behind Golden Eagle Farm after the 11-10 
favorite won his third stakes of the season on closing day. "I'll have to sit 
down and talk with (trainer) Ian (Jory), see how he comes out of the race, then 
sort the whole thing out." 
</P>
<P>
Although the California Cup Juvenile Nov. 3 at Santa Anita would be Best Pal's 
for the taking, the purse is only $100,000. Deposit Ticket, who won the 
Hollywood Juvenile, has flourished in the East, but there are no other 
2-year-olds who have really asserted themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can beat Deposit Ticket," Mabee said. "I'm not worried about him. 
He does have an advantage because he has been back East, but I think this horse 
can handle anything." 
</P>
<P>
Jory is in agreement and he left little doubt he'd like to go to the Breeders' 
Cup. The trainer hasn't been shy when talking about Best Pal -- he predicted a 
Futurity victory at the beginning of the meeting -- and nothing changed after 
the horse won for the fourth time in five tries. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's the best 2-year-old in the country," he said. "I don't think 
anybody can touch him. I'd think the Breeders' Cup is something we have in 
mind. We might possibly run him in the Norfolk (Oct. 7 at Oak Tree), but we'll 
have to sit down with Mr. Mabee and talk it over. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to train him up to the Breeders' Cup, but we'll see. He's done a fair 
share of racing for a 2-year-old, and we've got some plans for him next year. 
We don't want to burn him out." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were more than a few spectators who thought the winner should have 
been disqualified. Regional, the longest shot in the race at 63-1, nearly went 
down going into the first turn and Pillaring also was bothered. It appeared Pat 
Valenzuela and Best Pal may have crossed over the field without being clear. 
</P>
<P>
However, after conferring for several minutes, the stewards ruled there would 
be no change. This led to smiles from Jory and Mabee, the former president of 
Del Mar and still a member of the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"(Best Pal) came over and I almost got dropped going into the first turn," said 
Delahoussaye, Pillaring's rider. "I had to jump heels. I don't know if I was 
going to beat the winner, but it had to cost me a couple of lengths. My horse 
ran real well." 
</P>
<P>
Meza was just glad to make it back in tandem with Regional. He thought they 
were sure to be separated. 
</P>
<P>
"Patrick came right over and was never clear," he said. "I was close to going 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who has been silent around the media in recent weeks, told Mabee 
and Jory they had nothing to fear regarding the inquiry when he arrived in the 
winner's circle. Del Mar's leading rider did talk with Steve Schulein, a member 
of the track's publicity department, about the Futurity, probably because there 
were no reporters present. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran a super race," Valenzuela said to Schulein. "He's probably as good as 
any 2-year-old I've ever ridden. I think he'll get better with age. He's a nice 
horse." 
</P>
<P>
Got To Fly, in his first race with blinkers, was third, a head behind 
Pillaring. Formal Dinner, the 5-2 second choice while coupled with Running 
Total, was another six lengths back in fourth after setting the pace for about 
five furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of horse going into the turn, but the winner just came by and 
jerked the heart out of mine," said Gary Stevens of Formal Dinner, who had won 
the Sanford at Saratoga by four lengths in his previous outing. "But, he kept 
running." 
</P>
<P>
Bucking Bird was fifth, then came Magnificent Red, who was coupled with Best 
Pal, Arctic Deputy, Running Total, Regional, Sunshine Machine and Terrific 
Trip. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Fair will begin its 19-day meeting today with a 13-race 
card. First post is 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The $50,000-added Foothill Stakes at 6 1/2 furlongs is one of two feature 
attractions. A full field of 10 3-year-olds was entered, topped by Due To The 
King, Gundaghia, Candyman Bee and Cove Way. 
</P>
<P>
Due To The King is the 122-pound highweight and he will be ridden by Julio 
Garcia. Martin Pedroza, who finished in a three-way tie for the lead in the 
jockey standings at Fairplex last year, will be aboard Candyman Bee. David 
Flores and Corey Black, the two riders he tied with, will ride Pass The Blame 
and Cove Way, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Two races earlier, 2-year-old fillies will go 6 1/2 furlongs in the $40,000 
added Bustles and Bows Stakes. Ifyoucouldseemenow, an impressive maiden winner 
at Del Mar, Island Choice and Brazen top that lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar showed an overall increase of 2.6% in combined mutuel handle. The daily 
average was a record $7,510,866. Off-track handle was up 4.9% while there was a 
slight decrease -- less than 1% -- on track. On-track attendance was up 1.2% 
from last year (the daily average was 16,506, compared to 16,310 in 1989) and 
off-track increased 6.3% (a record 19,522 opposed to 18,370 last year). 
</P>
<P>
John Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm led the owner standings with a Del Mar record 
$644,034 in earnings. . . . Richard Mandella won with his last five starters at 
the meeting to tie Bill Spawr and Wayne Lukas in the trainer standings. They 
all ended up with 14 victories. Mandella won Wednesday with Song Stylist, Polar 
Boy and Indian Wind after scoring with Bel's Starlet and Corwyn Bay on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Best Pal, who also won the I'm Smokin and Balboa, was named Horse of the Meet 
by members of the media. Other winners in the balloting were: Sensational Star 
(sprinter), Quiet American (older horse), Live The Dream (grass horse), Bayakoa 
(older filly or mare), Tight Spot (3-year-old), Slew Of Pearls (3-year-old 
filly), Best Pal (2-year-old) and Beyond Perfection (2-year-old filly). . . . 
After riding King Of Will in the third race, Alex Solis took off the remainder 
of his mounts complaining of stomach cramps. Russell Baze missed the fifth and 
sixth races due to illness, but he came back to ride his final two mounts -- 
Shirkee and Terrific Trip.

Israel has closed a port in southern Lebanon after discovering it was used to 
smuggle Israeli food supplies to Iraq through Lebanon, security officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
They said the port of Naqoura, at the Lebanese-Israeli border and inside 
Israel's self-declared security zone in the south, was shut after Israel 
discovered that food being sent to Christian East Beirut had ended up in 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
The security officials said that the Israeli goods were repackaged in East 
Beirut under Lebanese labels and sent to Iraq through Syria and Jordan.

CAMBODIA PACT STIRS CALLS FOR CEASE-FIRE

Cambodian rebel and government leaders, following up on their acceptance of a 
United Nations peace plan, on Wednesday called for a voluntary cease-fire and 
began winding down radio propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Hun Sen, who arrived in Bangkok Wednesday, said that agreeing to the 
plan was a good start but that further steps were needed. In a government 
broadcast, he repeated his call for a cease-fire and said a Supreme National 
Council, part of the peace pact, should be convened promptly. 
</P>
<P>
He again urged a cease-fire before leaving for Jakarta, Indonesia, where, on 
Monday, the four Cambodian groups who have waged a civil war for more than a 
decade agreed to the U.N. terms. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to construct a new boat in which all of us could sail, that 
is the Supreme National Council," Hun Sen said at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is that now we have the boat, the passengers are on, but we have not 
yet put the engine on. We need to go very fast. That is why I have come here." 
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, commander of one of three resistance factions and the 
son of former Cambodian leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, made similar 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"Even before a formal agreement is reached, all Cambodians, if they really want 
peace, should create a peaceful, safe environment for implementation of a peace 
agreement," he told reporters here. "I am very favorable for a self-restraint 
cease-fire." 
</P>
<P>
The peace pact, meanwhile, was endorsed by both China, which has backed the 
hard-line Communist Khmer Rouge rebels, and Vietnam, which supports the 
Cambodian government. China also said it was ready for the first time to 
establish contact with the Cambodian government. 
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh quoted Khieu Samphan, leader of the Khmer Rouge, as saying he would 
prefer to wait for that conference before agreeing to a cease-fire, but that an 
interim cease-fire "may be" possible. 
</P>
<P>
The accord is designed to establish a transition administration so that 
hostilities can end and free elections can be held. It sets up a four-party 
Supreme National Council and commits the factions to a major U.N. role in the 
interim government. 
</P>
<P>
In talks late Wednesday with Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Choonhavan, Hun Sen 
proposed that the first council meeting take place at the former Cambodian 
embassy in Bangkok on Monday, Thai spokesman Suvit Yodmanee told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Suvit quoted Hun Sen as saying the meeting should elect a chairman and decide 
who should represent Cambodia at the U.N. General Assembly meeting later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Although a cease-fire is part of the U.N. plan, the pact is not expected to be 
effective until it is ratified in an international conference that is not 
expected to be convened before November.

Canadian and U.S. planes on Wednesday combed a 300,000-square-mile area in the 
northern Atlantic Ocean for a Peruvian Boeing 727 that ran low on fuel and 
ditched a day earlier with 16 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Coast Guard spokesman Chip Chase said the search area was expanded 
because satellite signals believed to be from the downed plane turned out to be 
from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has been sighted yet. We're going to continue searching as long as we 
can," said Chase, adding that he was uncertain how long those aboard could last 
in the water if they survived the ditching. 
</P>
<P>
The airplane, owned by Faucett Airlines of Peru, left Milan, Italy, early 
Tuesday. It refueled in Reykjavik, Iceland, before heading to Gander, 
Newfoundland, for a second refueling and was to arrive in Miami the same day. 
</P>
<P>
Chase said seven planes were involved in the search, including two U.S. Air 
Force Reserve Hercules, one from Iceland and the other dispatched from Detroit. 
Five Coast Guard and Canadian Navy ships also were involved in the search, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Chase said weather conditions were "pretty good" despite light fog, 3-to-6 foot 
waves and winds of 10-15 m.p.h.

MICHIGAN PASSES PARENTAL CONSENT ABORTION BILL

A measure to require girls to obtain parental consent for an abortion sailed 
through the Michigan Legislature on Wednesday, but abortion-rights activists 
pledged a quick counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
The measure requires unmarried girls 17 and younger to have permission from a 
parent or a judge to get an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
It will become law 90 days after the last legislative session in December, 
taking effect about April 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature approved an identical bill earlier this year, but Gov. James J. 
Blanchard vetoed it. Right To Life of Michigan then gathered about 330,000 
signatures to put it back before the Legislature, which took less than five 
hours to approve the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Because it began with a petition drive, Blanchard cannot veto the latest 
version. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Listing, president of Right To Life of Michigan, said it would 
encourage sexually active teen-agers to use birth control. Girls who do become 
pregnant will be able to get help, guidance and support from their families in 
deciding what to do, she added. 
</P>
<P>
State Rep. Maxine Berman denounced the bill as "a mean-spirited shame. A lot of 
teen-agers are going to find themselves in horrible positions because of this." 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Spillar, national coordinator for the Fund for a Feminist Majority, 
said laying the groundwork for a repeal effort will start immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be organizing the outrage and the anger. We know it's an uphill battle 
here," she said.

S.D.-BASED PLANES JOIN ESCALATING WAR ON DRUGS; 
</P>
<P>
SMUGGLING: HAWKEYE SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT AND CREWS WERE SENT LAST MONTH TO 
PANAMA AS PART OF THE INCREASED PENTAGON EFFORT TO STOP THE DRUG FLOW INTO THE 
UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
While staging the largest military build-up since Vietnam, the Pentagon is also 
stepping up efforts to fight the flow of drugs to the United States, military 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
To assist that battle, San Diego-based E-2C Hawkeye surveillance aircraft and 
crews have shipped out to Panama where they will be stationed at Howard Air 
Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
The planes, which are based at Miramar Naval Air Station, flew to Panama on 
Aug. 15 -- marking the first time Pacific Fleet surveillance planes have been 
deployed on a long-term basis to ferret out drug traffickers, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to do our work on the war on drugs and, at the same time, try 
to carry on the Operation Desert Shield. It may mean we put a little less 
towards the war on drugs," said Adm. Frank B. Kelso II, chief of naval 
operations, during a recent press conference in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the moment, officials say, they have heightened -- not slackened -- 
surveillance to halt the flow of drugs. A senior Administration official says 
the Pentagon has been able to "enhance detection and monitoring efforts" in 
international waters and air space despite the Middle East operation. 
</P>
<P>
One San Diego-based unit, comprising about five aircraft, flew to Howard Air 
Force Base in Panama last month. Normal deployments of this kind are no longer 
than 90 days, sources said. Officials will periodically evaluate the 
effectiveness of this unit and decide whether to continue. Citing security 
concerns, officials declined to identify specific squadrons that are involved. 
</P>
<P>
The $46-million Hawkeye is a fixed-wing propeller plane that distinguishes 
itself in the sky by the huge, round dish attached above its fuselage. As two 
pilots fly the plane, three crew members monitor information relayed by the 
rotating radar dish. They look for aircraft that have not filed a flight plan 
with the host country, that are flying below or above their filed flight plans, 
are not using lights, or are showing inappropriate fuselage or identifying 
markings. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in counter-narcotics efforts are not confined to the Pacific 
Fleet. The Atlantic Fleet has also sent aircraft and radar equipment to Panama 
to assist in monitoring smuggling. And the Navy and U.S. Customs officials are 
using P-3 Orion planes in the eastern Pacific, Atlantic and Caribbean regions. 
</P>
<P>
Crew members and aircraft stationed at the Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in 
Puerto Rico will continue in their current post as lookouts. Four AWACS 
(Advanced Warning Airborne Command System) and several KC-135 aircraft are 
stationed there. That group, which has double the funding of its West Coast 
counterpart, also has at least two Navy task groups that search dozens of boats 
each month. There are no AWACS stationed permanently in such a capacity on the 
West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of increasing our efforts at this time," said Major Doug 
Hart, a Department of Defense spokesman. "We are definitely stepping up efforts 
in the areas of interdiction and intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
The expansion is possible because the Department of Defense is expecting much 
more money to devote to interdiction, Hart said. In 1990, Defense spent an 
estimated $447 million on interdiction; in the proposed 1991 budget, officials 
have allocated $775 million. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, West Coast officials have felt the sting of fighting a battle 
in which their resources are dwarfed by their East Coast counterparts. In 
April, one lone surveillance plane, operating near San Diego, pursued five 
drug-smuggling planes at the same time. The AWACS lost track of three of them 
when they split up over the Gulf of California. Crew members aboard the plane 
relayed information to Mexican authorities and U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents, who snared the two planes, along with 3,000 pounds of 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Navy crew members, along with other military personnel, have no jurisdiction to 
arrest smugglers. Instead, they forward the information to arresting 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The new enhanced campaign is an effort to carry out plans approved by Secretary 
of Defense Dick Cheney on Sept 18, 1989. At that time, Cheney declared that the 
Pentagon's war on drugs was a high priority national security mission.

EX-VALDEZ LEAVES SAN DIEGO BAY; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE EXXON TANKER, REPAIRED AND RENAMED SINCE ITS MASSIVE OIL SPILL 
LAST YEAR, BATTLES PROTESTERS AND FOG TO SET SAIL FOR THE MIDEAST. 
</P>

<P>
Delayed first by environmentalists and then by the environment itself, the 
former Exxon Valdez left San Diego Bay six hours later than planned Wednesday, 
returning to service after 14 months of repairs with a new name, a new route 
and yet another encounter with Greenpeace under its belt. 
</P>
<P>
In an elaborate pre-dawn send-off, members of the environmental activist group 
scaled the side of the tanker, which has been rechristened the Exxon 
Mediterranean, and unfurled a banner that read "Sane Energy: When?" Two 
demonstrators, handcuffed to each other, perched atop the huge rudder, while 
six more attempted to block the ship's passage by forming a human oil boom in 
the chilly water. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Harbor Police officers quickly quashed the demonstration, arresting 
nine of about 40 protesters, according to Chief Arthur Le Blanc. But, by the 
time divers could confirm that demonstrators had not damaged the newly repaired 
hull of the tanker that caused the nation's worst oil spill, Exxon faced 
another problem: fog. 
</P>
<P>
"It was thick. Two hundred feet from the pier," the ship disappeared, said Fred 
Hallett, vice president of National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., where the 
ship was built and received $30 million in repairs. "Somebody said, 'She's 
gone.' And then the captain held her out in the channel for more than an hour." 
</P>
<P>
When the fog lifted, the Coast Guard and the Harbor Police escorted the 
Mediterranean out of the bay. At noon, the 987-foot ship finally set sail for 
Singapore, its first stop before heading to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Exxon officials announced that, because of declining need to transport 
Alaskan crude oil, the embattled vessel would become the first U.S.-licensed 
tanker to enter foreign service. It will load Mideastern oil and deliver it to 
Europe, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics charged that the reassignment was a public relations move designed to 
distance the ship from Alaska's Prince William Sound, where it ran aground 
March 24, 1989, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil and tearing up a third 
of its hull. 
</P>
<P>
But Exxon officials said good business sense, not image-building, predicated 
the change. On Wednesday, Les Rogers, a spokesman for Exxon Shipping Co., 
seemed unfazed by the protests and delays, saying he was just pleased that the 
vessel was on its way. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready for the voyage," he said, noting that the Mediterranean had 
demonstrated its seaworthiness in 10 days of ocean trials that ended last week. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace organizers, who assembled members from around the country for their 
early-morning protest, said their intention was both to delay the launch and to 
make the connection between oil spills and the military buildup in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
"We intended to stop the Exxon Valdez for as long as we could, but we also did 
it to make a point," said Kelly Quirke, a Greenpeace campaigner based in San 
Francisco, who said a second banner, which the protesters failed to hang, said, 
"From Alaska to Iraq, America's Dying for Oil." 
</P>
<P>
"There are two wars going on right now -- a war on the environment and an oil 
war," Quirke said. "They can't be separate, because the root is the same: 
over-dependence on fossil fuels." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Hollister, a Greenpeace action coordinator from Washington, said six boats 
carrying about 40 Greenpeace members, including two trained rescue divers, 
approached the tanker before sunrise at about 4:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Four climbers equipped with 16-foot ladders and compressed nitrogen suction 
cups headed up the side of the tanker with the intention of hanging the two 
banners. Before they could do so, however, the suction cups failed, causing 
three of the climbers to fall into the water. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Hollister said, they managed to attach the smaller banner to the ship. 
</P>
<P>
The two protesters who attempted to lock themselves to the tanker's steering 
column at the top of the rudder soon found that it was too big to encircle with 
their arms. So they "improvised," Hollister said, handcuffing themselves to 
each other instead. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the six people who made up the human boom chained themselves in 
place around a 20-foot inflatable globe that was painted to resemble the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
During the protest, Nassco's oil boom was slightly damaged, according to 
Hallett, who seemed more amused than distressed by the occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
"Here are individuals protesting the use of oil," he said with irony, "and it 
appears that they damaged an environmental safeguard to the ship." 
</P>
<P>
In general, however, law enforcement officials noted that the protesters were 
well-behaved. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very civil," said Le Blanc, the chief of Harbor Police. "When they 
were told they were under arrest, they acquiesced very peacefully." 
</P>
<P>
All nine protesters who were arrested were charged with misdemeanors -- ranging 
from trespassing to creating a disturbance, Le Blanc said. They were cited and 
released on their own recognizance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Gaunya, 28, a full-time Greenpeace employee from Washington, was 
the only person to be injured during the protest, organizers said. When the 
suction cups he was using to climb the tanker failed, he said, he fell, hit a 
floating oil boom and sprained his elbow. When asked if the protest was worth 
the pain, he replied, "Definitely." 
</P>
<P>
"I have peers in Saudi Arabia right now who possibly will be giving their lives 
for oil," said Gaunya, who attended a Greenpeace news conference with his right 
arm in a sling. "I wouldn't hesitate to do it again tomorrow."

CANYON FIRE IS NEARLY CONQUERED, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>

The wind-whipped brush fire that burned more than 3,300 acres as it sped 
through a rural canyon of luxury homes near Escondido this week was fully 
encircled by firefighters Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Forestry expects the 150 remaining firefighters to 
have the blaze extinguished by 8 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began about noon Monday, damaged five homes, forced the evacuation of 
more than 200 residents, and, for a time, threatened to leap Del Dios Highway 
and attack the lakeside community of Del Dios. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a line around the whole thing," CDF spokeswoman Audrey Hagen said 
Wednesday evening. "We had a couple of hot spots around Del Dios Highway at 
about 3:30 (p.m. Wednesday), but everything is looking good now." 
</P>
<P>
She said one lane of Del Dios Highway was temporarily closed Wednesday to deal 
with the spot fires, which were quickly extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone evacuated has been allowed back home. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are pinning the blame for the blaze on target shooters. Spent shell 
casings were found at the fire's origin. On Tuesday, one CDF official 
speculated that sparks from the muzzle of a high-velocity weapon could have 
started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Seven firefighters suffered minor injuries: a broken ankle, a twisted knee, a 
bee sting, cuts, bruises and a case of heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
A total damage figure has not yet been determined, but damage to homes alone is 
estimated at $100,000, CDF spokeswoman Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of fighting the fire was $650,000 -- $150,000 for the air assault and 
$500,000 for the ground crews and equipment, she added. 
</P>
<P>
CDF officials said more than $20 million in homes, property, animals, sheds, 
and other structures were spared by the work of firefighters and volunteers, 
who attacked the blaze house to house. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, air tankers continued to douse the area with fire retardant, and 
helicopters made trips to nearby Lake Hodges reservoir, scooping hundreds of 
gallons of water at a time to drop on the fire. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the homes affected by the fire had power restored by noon 
Tuesday, said SDG&amp;E spokesman Fred Vaughn. Two poles, a power line and a 
transmission pole were damaged in the fire, interrupting service to many homes 
at about 2 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell, meanwhile, ran into snags Wednesday that kept it from fully 
restoring phone service to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we still have 25 customers who are out of service," Pacific 
Bell spokesman Tommy McNaghten said Wednesday afternoon. Temporary cable to be 
laid today should solve the problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
McNaghten said customers still without phone service can make free local calls 
and credit card or collect long-distance calls from a truck at the intersection 
of Mt. Israel Road and Del Dios Highway. The truck will arrive at 6:30 a.m. 
today.

JAPANESE FIRM BUYS STAKE IN U.S. GRANT HOTEL; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: IT ACQUIRES HOMEFED'S $45-MILLION MORTGAGE HOLDING IN THE BANKRUPT 
DOWNTOWN LANDMARK.

<P>
A Japanese hotel company's purchase of HomeFed Bank's $45-million mortgage on 
the U.S. Grant Hotel last week should end the thrift's drawn-out and troubled 
involvement with the owners of the downtown landmark. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed, the hotel's leading creditor, would not reveal the amount Sansei U.S. 
Hotels Inc. paid for the notes and the hotel's $5-million parking garage. 
According to HomeFed, the hotel and garage are worth $30 million. "We are very 
pleased with the deal," spokeswoman Kaye Rowan said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sansei's acquisition of the notes and property does not necessarily mean 
that HomeFed will be severing all ties with the Grant, whose default on an 
initial loan of $32 million caused the hotel to declare bankruptcy in February 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sansei borrowed $30 million from HomeFed to finance the new arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"We've obviously assessed their credibility and determined that this is a 
worthwhile loan," Rowan said. "We know that the U.S. Grant is in good hands." 
</P>
<P>
Under the purchase agreement, Sansei now owns the U.S. Grant's 236-space 
parking garage, which HomeFed acquired as part of the hotel's debt 
restructuring plan last year after its owners filed for protection under the 
federal bankruptcy code. 
</P>
<P>
Sansei also will be able to foreclose on the hotel if its owners, U.S. Grant 
Associates, are not able to pay off their $50 million debt by Jan. 31, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Victor A. Vilaplana, a San Diego attorney who represented HomeFed in the 
bankruptcy proceedings, said HomeFed officials are relieved now that they can 
think of the hotel in terms of "normal loans, instead of a special arrangement 
. . . . All bankruptcy plans are sort of unusual." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they are pleased that the matter has been restructured in a more 
conventional way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Vilaplana said a second company, WestCoast Hotels, was going to 
join with Sansei in the deal. Under the final arrangement, WestCoast will 
simply manage the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
John Roberts, who has been the U.S. Grant's managing director since May, said 
the U.S. Grant's new management company is considering adding a swimming pool 
and a spa to the hotel, which has 286 rooms and more than 30,000 square feet of 
banquet and meeting space. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts also said the company is consulting with a major restaurant operator 
about the possibility of adding a theme restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
But the most significant addition WestCoast and Sansei will bring to the U.S. 
Grant is stability, Roberts said. "Finally we have a permanent owner." 
</P>
<P>
The 80-year-old hotel reopened in 1985 after a four-year, $64-million 
renovation. Investors were originally optimistic about the hotel's prospects as 
part of city's downtown renewal, which included the construction of Horton 
Plaza and the San Diego Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Within two years, however, unrealistic occupancy expectations and mismanaged 
marketing left the hotel mired in debt. HomeFed instituted foreclosure 
proceedings in September 1987. In February 1988, the Grant's owners declared 
bankruptcy to block HomeFed's plans to auction off the property. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the hotel and thrift agreed to a restructuring plan under which 
HomeFed would have the right to foreclose if the Grant owners cannot pay off 
nearly $50 million in debt or find a buyer by January, 1991. Under the 
arrangement announced last week, Sansei will assume HomeFed's right to take 
control of the hotel next year. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said business has been up at the hotel in recent months, though he 
declined to say by how much. Occupancy has generally been in the area of 50%, 
he said, which is approaching the hotel's goal of 60% to 70% occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Roberts acknowledged, meeting that goal could be tough, especially with 
the hotel room glut in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing as well as anybody in the downtown area," Roberts said.

INCORPORATION DRIVE SNARES RELUCTANT DEVELOPERS; 
</P>
<P>
CALABASAS: CITYHOOD PROPONENTS ARE JUBILANT AS LAFCO EXCLUDES ONLY ONE OF NINE 
BUILDERS FROM THE PROPOSED BOUNDARIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Six developers were rebuffed Wednesday in their attempt to win exclusion from 
the boundaries of the proposed city of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Local Agency Formation Commission, the government panel 
charged with overseeing incorporation proposals, agreed to exclude only one of 
nine developers who sought to be outside the city boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Two other developers withdrew their requests. 
</P>
<P>
The successful developer was the Los Angeles-based Johnston Group, which has 
one more office building to construct in a business park off the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood supporters hailed the decision as a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we're over most of our severe hurdles and don't anticipate any 
problems will show up," said Bob Hill, president of the Calabasas Cityhood 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which sets the election date, is 
expected to hold a hearing on the issue in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the supervisors and by area voters, the new city of Calabasas, 
population 27,000, would be about 11 square miles located in the Santa Monica 
Mountains west of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and other cityhood advocates finally allowed themselves to laugh, shake 
one another's hands and even hug on Wednesday -- the most emotion they have 
shown since commission hearings began July 11. 
</P>
<P>
Because their cityhood drives failed in 1981 and 1988, they have said they do 
not want to celebrate prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnston Group tempered the otherwise jubilant mood. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the company's Malibu Canyon Business Park/Corporate Center exempt 
from the proposed city, but on Tuesday it filed suit against the commission for 
approving Calabasas' independence without first conducting an environmental 
review. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin H. Johnston, the company's general partner, said he filed the Superior 
Court lawsuit out of concern that a new city would block construction of roads 
crucial to a regional transportation plan. 
</P>
<P>
But cityhood proponents said they did not consider the lawsuit a serious threat 
and expected incorporation to be placed on the March, 1991, ballot for voters' 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the developers seeking exclusion said they were already applying for 
building approvals from the county and were loathe to begin the process with a 
new bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
They also said they feared that a new City Council would enact a building 
moratorium, delaying their projects and costing them substantial sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
Commission attorney Clark Alsop acknowledged that newly incorporated cities can 
freeze construction for as long as 30 months while they adopt a general plan. 
</P>
<P>
During the last few weeks, the cityhood committee -- concerned that the 
exemptions would leave town fathers with little control over local land use -- 
met with the builders to persuade them otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting most builders' requests, the commission agreed with cityhood 
advocates that the properties' exclusion would carve up the proposed city, 
leaving Calabasas without cohesive boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners also noted that several of the developers had already received 
county planning approvals that would be difficult for a city to challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two developers -- Ring Financial, and a joint venture between Cabot, 
Cabot &amp; Forbes and the Currey-Riach Co. -- delighted cityhood champions by 
withdrawing their exclusion requests. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very classy group of people you have here seeking incorporation," 
said attorney Douglas Ring, who represented his uncle Ellis Ring's company. "I 
am genuinely impressed with them." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, who owns four shopping centers in Calabasas, said the only purpose of 
his lawsuit was to ensure that Calabasas wouldn't thwart regional 
transportation plans. 
</P>
<P>
He said Ventura Freeway alternative routes were crucial to his properties and 
his tenants. 
</P>
<P>
But cityhood advocates noted that they had worked out a transportation 
agreement with the county that would provide an alternative to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
And committee member Dennis Washburn suggested that the suit was really 
designed to stall incorporation until Johnston wins approval for his business 
park's eighth and final structure. 
</P>
<P>
Planned at eight stories -- five above the level of the freeway and three below 
-- the mid-rise office building would be the tallest in the business park, 
Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
Washburn said its height would be precedent-setting in the area and bound to 
stir controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Although Johnston denied that approval of the final building was his true goal, 
his attorney, Rogert L. Stanard, acknowledged that delays could be "a side 
benefit" of the suit.

CSUN TO USE GRANT TO HELP CHINA TRAIN ITS EDUCATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Cal State Northridge officials Wednesday announced that the university has 
received a grant from the People's Republic of China to assist in a massive 
overhaul of that country's educational system. 
</P>
<P>
The university will use a $965,888 grant to run a series of educational 
workshops aimed at boosting the quality of teaching in rural China, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN was selected by the Chinese government over three other universities to 
receive the grant. 
</P>
<P>
The university's application for the grant spurred some dissent last year among 
faculty members who said they feared that the university would appear to be 
supportive of China's totalitarian regime. 
</P>
<P>
But physics Prof. Paul Chow, who helped the university prepare its grant 
application, said the university's efforts will benefit common Chinese 
citizens, not the country's political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"People should make a very, very clear distinction between the people and 
politics," Chow said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people must be educated. Education has no boundary." 
</P>
<P>
More than 75% of the People's Republic of China's 2 million junior high school 
teachers do not have any college education and some did not finish high school, 
Chow said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a long-range plan to expand compulsory education in rural areas from 
six to nine years, the government has launched a massive effort to retrain some 
of these "unqualified" teachers. 
</P>
<P>
China received a $50-million loan from the World Bank earmarked for educational 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the money will be used to purchase equipment for schools, Chow said. 
</P>
<P>
With the grant money, Chow said, staff members with the campus's China 
Institute will recruit educational experts from around the world to go to China 
to run a series of two-week workshops. 
</P>
<P>
The sessions will be on topics ranging from methods of teaching physics and 
geography to the use of computers for educational management. 
</P>
<P>
Each workshop will accommodate about 40 faculty members of China's Institutes 
of Education, where Chinese secondary schoolteachers go on weekends, nights and 
vacations to improve their teaching skills, Chow said. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN competed for the grant against Ohio State University, Columbia 
University's Teachers College and the Ontario Institute for Studies in 
Education in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Some faculty members at the university were upset because they did not want to 
appear to support the Chinese government that in June, 1989, killed scores of 
students in a massacre in Beijing's Tian An Men square. 
</P>
<P>
They had urged the university to sever any educational links with China until 
its citizens were granted more freedom. 
</P>
<P>
But other CSUN professors argued that a better educated populace would be 
better able to press for change and freedom in their country.

FURLOUGHS URGED TO LIMIT JOB CUTS IN TORRANCE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance school officials and two unions representing non-teaching personnel 
are exploring a furlough program as a way to minimize layoffs of blue- and 
white-collar workers in the Torrance Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose as the district trimmed nearly $1.5 million from its nearly 
$80-million budget and eliminated 39 jobs. Meanwhile, contract talks are 
continuing between three unions and the district. 
</P>
<P>
Public discussion of furloughs -- days off without pay -- as a cost-saving 
mechanism came up at Monday's board meeting, attended by dozens of grim-faced 
school workers who crowded into the room or watched on a television set in a 
nearby hallway. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the board authorized a cost-cutting package that 
included axing the 39 jobs, some through attrition and the rest through 
layoffs. It also voted not to fill two other jobs and demoted 12 employees. 
Thirty-day notices to the workers being laid off will be mailed shortly, 
administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
No teachers were affected by the cuts. Teachers must be notified by March 15 of 
staff cuts in the coming school year. 
</P>
<P>
The furlough system, which would have to be negotiated between the unions and 
the district, received some support during and after the meeting, although 
trustees rejected an effort by board member John Eubanks to have it adopted 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Verna Font, leader of Local 99 of the Service Employees International Union, 
which represents 291 maintenance, custodial, cafeteria and other workers in the 
district, said: "I highly recommend that (the furlough concept) be brought to 
the negotiating table." 
</P>
<P>
And board member Ann Gallagher said in an interview after the meeting: "It's 
something that I would think seriously about." 
</P>
<P>
However, board President Owen Griffith and district administrators expressed 
caution, saying furloughs are not a cure-all and could create new problems. 
</P>
<P>
To cut $1,459,500 from the proposed 1990-91 budget, the board also dropped most 
high school bus transportation and some field trips, reduced the hours of some 
classroom aides, cut money for conferences, and suspended behind-the-wheel 
driver training. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second major budget cut in months. In March, the board trimmed $1.5 
million, eliminating 20 positions and reining in other spending. 
</P>
<P>
The board approved most of Monday's cuts by a wide margin, but before the votes 
were taken, workers went to the podium and urged the board to consider 
alternatives to layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to keep our schools a clean and safe place where our children can 
learn," said James Pepper, an assistant grounds foreman with the district for 
21 years. He said the staff cuts could result in hazards such as broken glass 
in play areas and sandboxes. 
</P>
<P>
Some board members, in turn, were apologetic. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't for a moment want to do what I'm proposing to do," David Sargent said 
after moving that seven clerical jobs be cut. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators said this week's budget slashing was made necessary by several 
factors, including reduced state funding, rising health-benefit costs and a new 
county fee for tax services. 
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum, Harvey Oelkers, assistant superintendent for business 
services, warned that Los Angeles County may now charge school districts for 
the cost of collecting and distributing property taxes -- a fee that could cost 
the Torrance district as much as $440,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
And Gov. George Deukmejian has set the cost-of-living adjustment for school aid 
at 3% instead of the 4.76% approved by the Legislature -- a $995,000 loss for 
the Torrance district, Oelkers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
On the furlough concept, it is unclear whether board members and union 
representatives see eye to eye. 
</P>
<P>
Some workers this week immediately endorsed the idea of furloughs as an 
alternative to layoffs. And a few said they would forgo a raise if it meant 
that their co-workers could keep their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be willing to give up that raise. I think everyone would," said Steve 
Ragsdale, a school maintenance mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
One union officer said that last week, at the bargaining table, his union 
suggested forgoing a raise and accepting a 10-day furlough -- which would in 
effect be 10 days without pay. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, it was a viable proposal. They didn't seem to be 
interested," said James W. Durham, first vice president of Chapter 19 of the 
California School Employees Assn., which represents district clerical and 
technical workers. He said the district prefers "doing away with jobs." 
</P>
<P>
As for the raise, Durham said the district's offer of 1% for clerical and 
technical workers is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Edward Richardson declined to comment, saying: "All of that is a matter 
of negotiations. We haven't said publicly what we have on the table." 
</P>
<P>
The district is negotiating with three unions whose contracts expired June 30: 
Local 99, Chapter 19 and the Torrance Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TORRANCE SCHOOL BUDGET CUTBACKS 
</P>
<P>
 The almost $1.46-million in budget cuts made by the Torrance school board this 
week and the amount saved include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Abolishing nine grounds maintenance jobs: $173,000. Mowing will be done 
every other week; trees will be trimmed once every three years instead of 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
* Abolishing 15 custodian and master custodian jobs and demoting 12 head 
custodians: $295,000. Classrooms will be cleaned less frequently. 
</P>
<P>
* Abolishing six maintenance mechanic jobs: $127,500. 
</P>
<P>
* Abolishing seven clerical jobs: $106,500. 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing hours of instructional assistants in kindergarten through third 
grade from 10 to eight hours: $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Canceling some field trips for grades kindergarten through 12: $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Eliminating virtually all high-school bus service by offering it only to 
students living more than 2.25 miles from school: $85,000. The limit is now two 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
* Cutting instructional supplies budgets by 10%: $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
The board, in a separate action, suspended behind-the-wheel driver training 
because of funds withheld by the state.

SUPERVISORS ADOPT UNPRECEDENTED FEES ALONG WITH $1.6-BILLION BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors on Wednesday gave tentative approval to a $1.6-billion 
county budget for 1990-91 that includes $13.5 million in administrative fees 
that will be charged to special districts, including school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The county will impose the controversial fees for its services in collecting 
property taxes for the districts. About $9 million in fees will come from 
school districts, and the rest will come from cities and special districts. 
There are 45 school districts and five community college districts in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
County spokesman Robert Lerner said the unprecedented fees will be used to help 
offset a $21-million shortfall in state funds for the county's medical programs 
for the working poor. During the current fiscal year, the County Medical 
Services health program for the poor had a $41-million budget. However, that 
will be reduced to $20 million beginning Oct. 1, when the new fiscal year 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the county will lose $23 million in state funds in the coming fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state Legislature passed a law to allow counties to impose the 
administrative fees, county officials expect local educators to challenge the 
fees either in court or by lobbying legislators to change the law. 
</P>
<P>
If the fees are successfully challenged or repealed, the county's medical 
programs for the working poor could be eliminated entirely as early as next 
February, Lerner said. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that health care for 25,000 persons will be stopped. You'll have an 
awful lot of working people who cannot afford to pay for health care on their 
own going without it," Lerner said. 
</P>
<P>
The county contracts with nonprofit community clinics to provide health care 
for the working poor. On Tuesday, representatives from various clinics were at 
the board meeting to express their concern over the funding shortage and 
possible elimination of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant supervisors voted 4 to 1 to impose the administrative fees. Only 
Supervisor John MacDonald, a former educator, voted against the fees. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a protest vote more than anything," MacDonald said. "Although the 
county needs to backfill some important health programs, the way the 
Legislature forced us into raising those fees was tantamount to being 
unethical." 
</P>
<P>
"The formula imposed on us by the Legislature was not fair. It had nothing to 
do with the size of the districts. It only had to do with the amount of taxes. 
There are some small districts that will have $250,000 obligations. I felt it 
was a real unfair formula." 
</P>
<P>
According to MacDonald, schools will pay $100 million in administrative fees in 
California because of the new law. The San Diego Unified School District is 
expected to pay about $3 million in fees. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Boysen, superintendent of the County Office of Education, called the fee 
a way of "robbing Peter to pay Paul." Although Boysen blamed the state for 
forcing the board to take action on the fees, he complained that the county is 
attempting to balance its budget by "taking $9 million away from 
schoolchildren." 
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely going to be a challenge at the state level. I think the 
California School Board Assn. will get all the school districts together and 
file one lawsuit," Boysen said. 
</P>
<P>
In another effort to raise revenue, cash-starved supervisors also voted to 
charge a booking fee to cities for all prisoners in the county jails. County 
officials estimated that the fee will raise about $3 million in new funds, 
which will be used to help run the jails. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego would be exempted from paying the booking fee because of an agreement 
that it signed with the county last year, Lerner said. However, the board 
directed its jail subcommittee to reopen talks with San Diego in hopes of 
getting the city to agree to pay the fee. 
</P>
<P>
Other features in the budget approved by the board: 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing the Superior Court budget by nearly $1 million and the Municipal 
Court's by more than $555,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing the county marshal's budget by $275,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Allocating $2.5 million more for alternate defense counsel contracts for 
indigent defendants. 
</P>
<P>
* Directing the chief administrative officer to find ways to implement a 3% 
across-the-board reduction in general fund expenditures beginning Jan. 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The chief administrative officer is expected to offer a pro forma resolution 
for approval of the budget at the board's Sept. 25 meeting. Final approval is 
expected Oct. 2.

CARSON AIMS AT $29-MILLION BUDGET; LESS THAN IN '89-'90 
</P>

<P>
The Carson City Council agreed Monday on $29 million as the target for the 
current year's budget, a decrease of $900,000 from what the city spent last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, made at a budget workshop more than two months into the fiscal 
year that began July 1, set no specifics for the amounts to be spent by each 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Vera Robles DeWitt said the council hopes to vote on a complete budget 
package, which will be drafted by Finance Director Lorraine Oten, at a budget 
hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the council passed a $34.8-million budget but spent only $29.9 
million after instituting a hiring freeze and cuts in capital purchases midway 
through the year to keep down an anticipated deficit. However, the city still 
spent $2.2 million from its reserves to balance the 1989-90 fiscal budget. 
There is now $7 million in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The city's financial problems stem, in part, from stagnant sales tax revenues, 
on which the city depends for about half of its income. Overall, expenditures 
have risen almost twice as much as revenues in the last five years, city 
officials said. In addition, state budget cuts this year cost Carson $1 million 
in anticipated revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The city built up a large reserve fund in the early 1980s, which the city wants 
to preserve. Officials are reluctant to use it for routine expenses, preferring 
to reserve it for replacement of capital equipment and emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The latest 1990-91 budget proposal is an increase from the $28-million spending 
package presented to the council last week by an advisory committee. The 
committee's proposed budget recommended steep reductions in services and 
layoffs to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
In writing the budget, Oten will use suggestions made by employees, union 
representatives and staff, as well as public and council input at workshops 
held this week. The budget is likely to include an array of increases in fees 
and charges for services, council members said. 
</P>
<P>
Oten presented the tentative $29-million spending plan to the council at its 
workshop Monday. Discussions at the workshop indicated that any final budget 
will require layoffs, although the number of positions that would be affected 
has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
Oten said her tentative proposal is fiscally sound and is based on "a more 
optimistic outlook" regarding city revenues than the advisory committee's. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, proposed fee increases would account for an additional 
$600,000 in revenue. Such increases would include raising the price of Parks 
and Recreation Department swimming lessons and swimming pool rental fees, as 
well as instituting a charge for participating in the city's youth sports 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The latest proposal, one of many efforts since May, moves the city a step 
closer to adopting a final budget for this fiscal year. Last year's budget was 
adopted halfway into the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt last week blamed the other council members for the city's recurring 
tardiness in preparing a budget. "Nobody wanted to bite the bullet" and face 
budget cuts, she said, adding that hostility among council members has made it 
difficult to work together on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Sylvia Muise and Michael Mitoma disagreed, saying city 
department heads had done a poor job in coming up with areas where they could 
save money. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that staff becomes politically motivated when it comes to budget 
time," Muise said. "I think staff, in fact, riles up the troops if we propose 
any cuts -- that's how staff saves their territory." 
</P>
<P>
Mitoma said the staff "is under the misguided conception that there are 
unlimited resources in the city."

JUDGE HIS VOICE, NOT HIS ATTIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was very disappointed with Nat King Cole Jr.'s comments in the Los Angeles 
Times (Aug. 24) in which he criticized my performance in a singing contest 
because I did not wear a necktie. 
</P>
<P>
The advertisement we responded to was for a singing contest, not a beauty 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
We were told not to wear a tie if we felt like it. 
</P>
<P>
I did not like the review that Mr. Cole gave me. I have sung in hundreds of 
nightclubs and nightspots and have always been a hit. I have a good voice and 
should have been judged for my voice -- not if I had a tie on or not. I am now 
in the process of forming my own music company. 
</P>
<P>
All of us contestants should have been judged for our singing, not for our 
dress. I, for one, thought that everyone who performed that evening did an 
absolutely wonderful job.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FOUNDRY VIOLATES EMISSIONS LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District says a Torrance foundry has 
violated a court order limiting its emissions of airborne lead particles. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD prosecutor Joseph Panasiti said two samples taken last week outside the 
Martin Brass Foundry at 2341 Jefferson St. show lead concentrations exceeding 4 
micrograms per liter of air. The foundry is under a court injunction to keep 
its lead emissions below 3 micrograms per liter. 
</P>
<P>
Panasiti said Wednesday that he will request a hearing on the issue in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. Charles Ivie, an attorney representing the foundry, 
said he considers the court-ordered limit on lead emissions too stringent and 
will ask that it be increased.

POISON GRAIN KEEPS UNDERGROUND SQUIRRELS UNDER CONTROL AT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wondering where most of the ground squirrels have gone at San Elijo State 
Beach? 
</P>
<P>
They are underground, of course, but not playing or hibernating or planning a 
migration to some better home. 
</P>
<P>
They're dead. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 80% of ground squirrels at the beach were poisoned in late July 
under a California Department of Parks and Recreation effort to keep them from 
bothering campers and to prevent the tunneling rodents from further eroding the 
area's bluffs and undermining park facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, the squirrels were a biological and environmental and facilities 
problem that was getting worse fast," said Bill Tippets, a senior resource 
ecologist with the Parks Department. "We had to take them down to a reasonable 
number." 
</P>
<P>
The beach's ground squirrel population was cut from an estimated 500 to less 
than 100, Tippets said. 
</P>
<P>
"The population is low, but they're still there," he said. "We've had no 
(recent) complaints from the public" about the poisoning program or squirrels 
bothering campers. 
</P>
<P>
The ground squirrels, which are considered pests under state law, were poisoned 
with oat grain laced with the chemical diphacinone. The tainted grain was 
placed in small bait stations made of narrow piping for two weeks in late July. 
</P>
<P>
After eating the grain, the squirrels become lethargic and, fearing 
vulnerability from predators above ground, instinctively return to their 
burrows, where they die, Tippets said. 
</P>
<P>
"Something had to be done. There were just too many of them," he said. "It was 
an unnatural situation: they can be aggressive because they have learned to beg 
and people feed them. Campers were saying the squirrels were infesting or 
invading the campsites to the point that they weren't able to use them." 
</P>
<P>
The department routinely evaluates the pest populations at state beaches and 
parks and periodically uses poisons to reduce their numbers when they become a 
nuisance, Tippets said. 
</P>
<P>
Overpopulation of ground squirrels and other animals considered pests occurs 
because of the absence of predators such as eagles, hawks, foxes and coyotes 
and because of the availability of nonnatural food sources such as handouts 
from people. 
</P>
<P>
The upsetting of the ecological balance creates an environment in which ground 
squirrels proliferate to an abnormally high density, and, in the case of San 
Elijo State Beach, creates the need to reduce their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Diphacinone, which is similar to rat poison, is approved by the state for pest 
control purposes. The chemical is an anti-coagulant that affects a body's 
ability to form blood clots. A ground squirrel will die after eating several 
batches of diphacinone-tainted grain. 
</P>
<P>
The poison has been used at other state parks in San Diego, but this was the 
first time it was used at San Elijo to control a pest population, Tippets said. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials will monitor the squirrel population to determine whether 
additional poisoning will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
Enough of the rodents remain so that San Elijo will have a thriving ground 
squirrel community, Tippets said. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials never considered poisoning all the squirrels, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would we consider eradication? Just because one link in the food chain 
(predators that prey on the squirrels) is gone doesn't mean that another group 
can't exist. The squirrels have a right to be there, but their numbers have to 
be controlled to a reasonable level." 
</P>
<P>
At San Elijo, the ground squirrels burrows were undermining the bluffs and park 
facilities, such as parking lots, comfort stations, outdoor amphitheater and 
other structures, Tippets said. Minor repair work will be needed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"These squirrels are active burrowers, and they were causing significant bluff 
erosion," he added. "It is not that bad now, but it would be if they were 
allowed to continue to grow." 
</P>
<P>
The Parks Department received a few complaints that the poisoning was inhumane, 
but it was not feasible to trap and move the squirrels to a new site, Tippets 
said. Also, a legal birth control agent like one that was used to reduce the 
pigeon population in Balboa Park in 1986 isn't available for squirrels, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Several San Diego animal advocate groups said they were unaware of the 
squirrel-control program or were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The bait stations were above ground, but the openings were too small for 
children or pets to reach the tainted grain, Tippets said. The stations have 
since been removed and squirrel-control signs posted temporarily have been 
taken down. 
</P>
<P>
San Elijo State Beach in Cardiff has 171 campsites on 42 acres.

Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation did its third liver transplant 
overnight Tuesday, on a 49-year-old San Diego man. 
</P>
<P>
The six-hour surgery on the man, who declined to be identified, began about 6 
p.m. Tuesday, a Scripps spokeswoman said. He needed a new liver because of a 
condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis, a hardening and inflammation 
of the bile ducts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Whittier woman who underwent a liver transplant at Scripps last 
Friday was upgraded earlier this week to serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Those two transplants followed the July death of the first person to undergo 
the operation in Scripps' new program.

D.A. REJECTS CASE AGAINST OFFICER CHARGED WITH SOLICITING PROSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing insufficient evidence, the district attorney's office has declined to 
prosecute a San Diego police sergeant arrested for allegedly soliciting a 
prostitute at the Del Mar race track last month. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Rooten said he rejected the case because the Sheriff's 
Department couldn't prove that Sgt. Reginald Frank had asked a undercover 
female deputy for sex or offered money for such an act. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no specific act mentioned and no overt act," Rooten said. "If there 
had been an exchange of money or they had gone to a certain location, that 
would constitute something. But there's a lack of evidence that a crime had 
been committed. It's just not there." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his arrest, Frank, 36, was accused of offering $40 for a sex 
act. Lt. John Walker, who heads the Sheriff's Department's special 
investigation vice detail, said at the time that Frank was arrested as part of 
a random sting. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, who works in the police robbery division, also has served on the Border 
Crime Prevention Unit, a joint anti-crime squad made up of San Diego police and 
Border Patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Frank said little about the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's better to keep my mouth shut and get on with my life," he said. 
"It really hurt. I have a family and 12 1/2 years on the force. But now it 
feels good." 
</P>
<P>
Rooten said his office does not discuss cases that are not filed. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Glenn Revell, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, would not comment on the 
matter except to say that the department was aware that no charges would be 
filed and accepted the decision. 
</P>
<P>
But Everett Bobbitt, Frank's attorney, called the arrest "a real bad bust. It's 
the first case I can recall where I felt that a ticket should not have been 
issued." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt said the undercover female deputy was inexperienced at conducting 
prostitute stings and had portrayed a prostitute only three other times. 
</P>
<P>
"They took an inexperienced deputy and said, 'Fill this role,' " Bobbitt said. 
"You have to know an entrapment situation. It takes a lot of experience and 
training." 
</P>
<P>
According to Bobbitt, who read the undercover deputy's written recollection of 
the case, the deputy approached Frank at the track as he was filling out a 
betting slip, introduced herself and said she was confused about betting. Frank 
explained the procedure, then the deputy excused herself, telling him, "I'll be 
around if you need anything," Bobbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, Bobbitt said, she returned and asked Frank whether he had won. 
He said he had. She told him that she knew nothing about betting, and Frank 
asked her what prompted her to come to the track. "Don't you know what I do?" 
she asked, according to Bobbitt. He said Frank thought she might be an 
undercover officer and had recognized that he was a cop. 
</P>
<P>
The undercover officer said she was going to walk out to her van and Frank said 
he would walk with her. She then asked him if he would offer her something, 
Bobbitt said. When he asked her what she had in mind, she asked him if he would 
offer her money, Bobbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt said Frank told the undercover deputy that he only had $40 and then was 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is like charging someone with running a stop sign and looking back 
and realizing there's no stop sign," Bobbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Rooten said the undercover officer did not tape-record the conversation.

AD MAKES CASE FOR AN ELECTED CITY ATTORNEY, SEEKS CANDIDATES FOR JOB; 
</P>
<P>
BALLOT: SANTA MONICA VOTERS HAVEN'T DECIDED YET ON AN INITIATIVE TO MAKE THE 
OFFICE ELECTIVE RATHER THAN APPOINTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica voters have not yet had the chance to decide whether they want to 
make the city attorney an elected position, but a residents group behind the 
ballot measure has begun advertising for candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monicans for the Citizens Protection Act, the group that through an 
initiative drive placed the question of an elected city attorney on the Nov. 6 
city ballot, ran a quarter-page ad last week in the Los Angeles Daily Journal, 
a legal newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
In the corner of the ad, which cost the group $495, is a picture of the goddess 
of justice, with "City Attorney, City of Santa Monica" in bold letters. 
</P>
<P>
The ad says candidates must be registered Santa Monica voters at the time of 
nomination, November, 1990, for an election in February, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In a box, the ad emphasizes that "the candidate should have a personal and 
professional commitment to upholding and obeying all laws of the land and must 
not have prior criminal record." 
</P>
<P>
The ad calls for candidates to send resumes and a photo to the campaign 
headquarters of Santa Monicans for the Citizens Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the measure, listed as Proposition Y on the ballot, are 
attempting to oust City Atty. Robert M. Myers because of his policy not to 
prosecute homeless people for such misdemeanors as sleeping in parks and public 
inebriation. They have also made an issue of the several times that Myers was 
arrested in connection with his participation in protests against nuclear 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
They say Myers' tolerant attitude toward the homeless is to blame for a growing 
homeless population in the city and aggressive panhandling and attacks by some 
transients. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Dutton, an organizing member of the group, was one of three people 
filing a complaint against Myers last week with the State Bar of California, 
the regulating agency for attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint charges Myers with violating the State Bar's Act and Rules of 
Professional Conduct for not prosecuting those certain misdemeanors and claims 
that his misdemeanor arrests for trespassing in protest of nuclear testing in 
Nevada constitute an act of moral turpitude. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Scott, a State Bar spokeswoman, said state law prohibits comment or 
characterization of complaints filed against attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Myers said complaints have been filed against him in the past for his actions 
without any disciplinary action being taken. He said Dutton filed the complaint 
to get media attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Leslie Dutton's consistent tactic has been to file complaints even though she 
knows they go nowhere," said Myers, who was appointed city attorney in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Myers said other complaints in connection with his arrests were filed against 
him in June, 1987, and a year ago. In both cases, he said, the State Bar 
determined that there was insufficient grounds for disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
Myers also criticized the ad placed by Dutton's group, saying it gave a false 
impression that the city is looking for a city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an attempt to prescreen candidates for the office of city attorney," he 
said. "She wants to pick people who share her right-wing philosophy if the 
measure passes." 
</P>
<P>
The homeless issue and the ballot measure to make the city attorney an elected 
office are expected to be key issues in the race for three seats on the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Councilwoman Christine Reed has been a vocal opponent of Myers and 
has given her support to the ballot measure. Of the nine candidates for City 
Council, five oppose Proposition Y. In addition, Santa Monicans for Renters 
Rights, a powerful tenants group, opposes the measure.

2 ATHLETES TO STAND TRIAL IN ARMED ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two former high school athletes were ordered Wednesday to stand trial for 
committing three armed robberies in Escondido and Vista before a high-speed 
chase that left a companion dead from an apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Arrington and Hubert Phillips, both 19, were ordered to appear Sept. 
26 in Superior Court after a preliminary hearing by San Diego Municipal Judge 
Charles Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
They are accused of holding up a Vista cab driver, the night auditor at an 
Escondido motel and a baker in a doughnut shop, all within 30 minutes at about 
3 a.m. Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Phillips was a star senior fullback at Southwest High School. 
Arrington also played football and had attended Tuskegee University in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Cab driver Judee Davis identified Phillips in court as the gunman who robbed 
her of $83 while she was sitting in her cab outside a Vista restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Davis called sheriff's deputies from the restaurant, supplying a partial 
license plate number. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Debra Miller said she saw a white Honda with the same partial 
license letters in Escondido minutes later and began a chase that ended in 
Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Other deputies responded and officers found the stolen car abandoned near 
Southwest High School. In the back seat was the body of 17-year-old Cahill 
Muhammad, who had died from a gunshot wound in an apparent suicide.

Fred Bray, the night auditor at a Best Western Motel in Escondido, said a man 
wearing a black mask held him up at gunpoint and took $195. 
</P>
<P>
Bray testified that he gave the gunman bills and rolls of quarters, and that, 
when he turned to hand him some rolls of dimes, the gunman had left. Bray said 
a camera recorded the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Donut Star baker Rey Ouk testified that a gunman jumped over his counter and 
demanded money. He said he gave the man $65, adding that he thought the gunman 
was the same one who had robbed him previously of $200.

Sheriff's Deputy Alan Cutsinger said that Arrington denied being involved after 
his arrest, but later conceded he was the driver in the holdups. 
</P>
<P>
Arrington refused to identify any accomplices, said the deputy but did say that 
the teen-ager found dead in the car feared going to prison if arrested and had 
planned to commit suicide first. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Russell Moore said a police dog found Arrington hiding in some bushes 
near the high school. He said Arrington told deputies to kill him, saying he 
was not going to "snitch" on any of his friends, Moore said.

A PRICE TAG THAT CONTINUED TO GROW AND GROW; 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY HILLS: CITY MANAGER MARK SCOTT SAYS THE NEW CIVIC CENTER COST FAR MORE 
THAN EXPECTED BECAUSE OFFICIALS FAILED TO WATCH THE BOTTOM LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nine years and $121 million later, Beverly Hills is starting to come to terms 
with the cost of its lavish new Civic Center, originally estimated at a quarter 
of the price. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released to the City Council Tuesday night, City Manager Mark Scott 
said his five-month investigation found that decision-makers failed from the 
start to keep their eyes on the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
Obsessed with building a Taj Mahal of the Westside, they found themselves 
saddled with costs that relentlessly escalated and could not be stopped without 
undermining the project's basic architectural concepts. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the arched rotunda spanning Rexford Drive, the heart of architect 
Charles Moore's Italianate design, was part of a group of outdoor structures 
whose cost was "dramatically underestimated" at $2 million by Moore's own 
consultant, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
"When the real costs of these elements were understood, it was far too late to 
make major changes," Scott said, referring to the later $14-million cost. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to check the old library building for asbestos also caused "serious 
delays and additional costs." So did a decision to dig foundations for the 
police station so deep that the excavation became a mudhole. 
</P>
<P>
The report named no culprits. But Scott, who was named to the city's top job 
when his predecessor retired under fire earlier this year, said that a separate 
investigation by a team of lawyers and accountants may lead to legal action. 
</P>
<P>
For the future, Scott urged the City Council to develop a "tolerance for bad 
news . . . so you can find out what's wrong and do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Excluding a separate $12-million contract for renovating the 59-year-old City 
Hall, Scott's report found a $109.1-million bottom line for the costs of 
building the Civic Center. As recently as November, 1989, City Council members 
were told that the total would be $14 million less. 
</P>
<P>
The latest estimate includes $27.6 million for the police station, $21 million 
for the library, $9.3 million for the fire headquarters, $8.5 million for 
parking and $14 million for outdoor work including an amphitheater and Moore's 
soaring concrete arches. 
</P>
<P>
Other costs include a $6-million security and communications system for the 
Police and Fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
Poring over old reports and other archival data, Scott said, he felt like "an 
archeologist and historian," turning up "twists and turns that would probably 
put 'Twin Peaks' to shame." 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Baroque-styled City Hall has towered over Santa Monica Boulevard 
since 1931, but civic-minded individuals started talking about a more elaborate 
complex in the 1960s, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the cramped quarters of the Police Department and library, and 
worried that the old fire station would not survive an earthquake, the City 
Council hired a consultant in 1981 to report on the city's needs for space. 
</P>
<P>
A design competition followed, calling for architects to come up with a civic 
center that would also include an ill-defined, 25,000-square foot "Community 
Cultural Complex." 
</P>
<P>
That concept eventually emerged as a proposal for a full-fledged community 
theater before it was cut to save money, but when a design jury chose Moore's 
proposal in 1982, the $30 million cost seemed easily affordable. 
</P>
<P>
"The $30-million figure that was estimated was a very early, preliminary 
figure," Scott stressed, saying that other costs, such as architectural and 
engineering fees, brought the first real estimate up to $36.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although it chose Moore's design, the jury composed of prominent architects and 
scholars took pains to add some recommendations of its own that were sure to 
raise the cost. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the jury urged that Moore's "new spaces of great richnesses" be 
executed "finely and in enduring materials," not the stucco that Moore 
originally suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"As the design develops, pressures will mount to make further economies. The 
central rotunda must not be eliminated or much reduced in scale or quality. 
Without it, the design has no heart," the jury said. 
</P>
<P>
As Scott read that excerpt Tuesday night, City Council members interjected 
snorts of sardonic laughter, knowing that the concrete casting needed to make 
the rotunda had proven to be one of the most problematic and expensive parts of 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it perfectly clear that this was well before the time any of us 
was on the council," Councilman Max Salter said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in college at the time," joked Councilman Robert K. Tanenbaum (who, in 
fact, graduated from UC Berkeley in the mid-1960s). 
</P>
<P>
An assumption that city workers would not have to move to temporary quarters 
during construction also proved to be "extremely naive and costly," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfied with Moore's estimate, the city took another look at the project, 
added several millions to upgrade the exterior and make other improvements, and 
came up with its first genuine budget for the project in 1984 -- $65.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that the fire station and parking structure went out to bid. In 
retrospect, Scott said, "there is no question that proceeding with these 
elements made it more difficult to adjust" as the theater was dropped, the arch 
work bogged down and departmental needs evolved over time. 
</P>
<P>
"The Civic Center project suffered continually from 'fast-track' processes and 
from failure to set clear, up-front objectives," he concluded. "Options were 
limited because previous phases had been initiated already. In many instances, 
budgets did not precede design, they followed them." The theater was dropped in 
1985, a difficult decision that was expected at the time to save about $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
After a long redesign process, the City Council voted in late 1986 to award the 
contract to finish the job to the J. A. Jones Construction Co. of North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
It was during Jones' contract that the asbestos and ground-water problems 
surfaced, but Scott said possible legal problems made it difficult for him to 
go into too much detail about the last two years of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been suggested to me that it's not a topic I should spend a lot of time 
talking about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, City Councilman Bernard J. Hecht broke in to say, "They never had 
an asbestos inspection!" but he was shushed by his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1987 and the end of 1989, the construction cost of the final phase -- 
the library, the police station and the outdoor structures -- rose from the 
Jones company's $43.6 million original bid to roughly $53 million in November 
of last year, but "staff wishes to be cautious in characterizing case and 
responsibility," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
As of now, he said, it should cost another $14.5 million to finish the project, 
but differences with Jones over more than 500 change orders could affect the 
final cost. 
</P>
<P>
Tanenbaum, who campaigned against the large scale of the Civic Center when he 
was first elected in 1986, recalled that his proposal to scale it down was 
outvoted shortly after he took office. 
</P>
<P>
He said that "negligent, incompetent, bureaucratic behavior" led to the 
excesses of the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
"But it has its positive side," he said, comparing it to the Eiffel Tower in 
Paris, which was highly controversial when it was built. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty years from now, people are going to say, 'What a bright group of people 
they must have been to build these beautiful buildings,' " Salter added. 
</P>
<P>
"People will come to see it," Salter said. "They won't have to go to the 
Vatican. We've got it here."

DOWNEY'S CIVIC CENTER TOOK LESS BY 6 YEARS, $112 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How much did it cost to build a Civic Center in Downey, where officials started 
thinking about a new municipal edifice complex at about the same time as 
Beverly Hills did? 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing, including the furniture, cost roughly $8.5 million to $9 
million," Assistant City Manager Lee Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
There's another big difference between the two projects: Downey's was finished 
six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Powell said municipal workers and the public in the city of 88,000 in 
southeastern Los Angeles County are more than satisfied with the three-story 
building of glass, brick and steel, complete with a soaring atrium. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends where you were before," he said. "We used to have our City Hall in 
an old schoolhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the relatively low cost and quick construction of the Downey City Hall, 
"Lord knows, things didn't go perfectly smoothly," Powell said in an interview. 
But he doubted that the lessons learned would be of much use in either city. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned lots of things about building city halls, but I guess we won't be 
able to use them till we're all dead, and somebody else will have to figure it 
out all over again," he said.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: TOTH HEADED FOR ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Socker goalkeeper Zoltan Toth has reached a verbal agreement to play for the 
St. Louis Storm, but the deal may not be ironed out until Monday, Storm Coach 
Don Popovic said. 
</P>
<P>
It had been reported that Toth left San Diego and signed with St. Louis 
Wednesday. But Popovic said Toth was still in San Diego when they spoke 
Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not here," he said. "We've agreed verbally on everything, but the deal 
isn't done. Nothing is signed." 
</P>
<P>
Popovic said Toth, the MSL's all-time leader in winning percentage and 
goals-against average and is tied for first with Baltimore's Scott Manning for 
all-time playoff victories (35), would start ahead of 10-year veteran Slobo 
Ilijevski. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally think he's the best in the league," said Popovic, who coached 
Toth while both were with the New York Arrows. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Toth, 34, brings to three the number of veterans the Sockers have 
lost from last year's championship team. Defender Ralph Black signed with 
Tacoma, defender George Fernandez with Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's true," said Socker Coach Ron Newman. "I'm sorry to see him go. 
He's a good player and a good friend. We just got caught in the old money 
trap." 
</P>
<P>
Newman said the Sockers were already locked into a contract with Victor 
Nogueira, the No. 1 goalkeeper from the 1988-89 season, and that keeping both 
was financially impossible. Although he knew of several teams that were 
interested, Newman said he had hoped that Toth, a Socker since 1984, would 
reach an agreement to stay. Newman said Toth told him he was willing to take a 
pay cut to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"He did say he didn't want to go anywhere," Newman said. "I was hoping we could 
do something here for him. He did agree to a substantial cut, but it still 
meant we had two goalkeepers." 
</P>
<P>
Toth was second to forward Branco Segota on the team's player payroll last 
year, earning $68,000 to Segota's $102,000. 
</P>
<P>
Popovic wouldn't indicated how much Toth's contract would be worth, but that 
both sides were satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"He's happy, and I'm happy that we could reach a figure management agreed on," 
Popovic said. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

INJURY KNOCKS DUFF FROM STARTING ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jamal Duff, a freshman linebacker from Tustin, was one of the few defensive 
players singled out by Coach Al Luginbill as having had even an adequate game 
Saturday against Oregon. But only four days after playing what Luginbill called 
"a tremendous football game," Duff learned that he lost his starting outside 
linebacker spot to junior Lou Foster. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances were beyond Duff's control. He was kneed in the right 
quadriceps by a teammate during the second half Saturday, forcing him to miss 
practice Monday and Tuesday. And Foster, a transfer from DeAnza Community 
College, is about 90% back from the hamstring injury he suffered early in camp. 
</P>
<P>
Duff, who also has a chipped fracture in his right hand, practiced Wednesday 
and is expected to play Saturday against Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate, but that's the game," Duff said. "I'll just have to work 
hard to get my job back." 
</P>
<P>
Duff, 6-feet-7 and weighs 225 pounds, said he could have played better against 
Oregon. "I don't really feel like I was on my game. I missed too many tackles." 
</P>
<P>
Other than the change at outside linebacker, Luginbill said all other starting 
positions will probably remain the same. He said, though, that that could 
change as late as Saturday night. "I won't be afraid to make changes 
immediately during the game," he said. "The players were made aware of it." . . 
. Luginbill said the intensity level has been "very good" in practice all week. 
"We didn't have this kind of intensity in practice until the seventh game last 
year. But I said that last week and look what happened in Oregon." . . . 
Defensive end Steve Matuszewicz (left ankle) and free safety Zac Stokes (left 
shoulder fracture) are out of Saturday's game. Luginbill said he is leaning 
toward redshirting Matuszewicz.

U.N. NEAR ACCORD ON IRAQ FOOD AID; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: THE U.S.-SPONSORED PLAN WOULD ALLOW LIMITED HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE. IT SEEKS TO DEAL WITH THIRD WORLD PROTESTS AND FORESTALL BLOCKADE 
LEAKAGE. 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council neared approval Wednesday of a compromise plan to 
permit limited humanitarian shipments of food to Iraq, U.N. sources said, as 
the United States maneuvered to prevent a major breach of the embargo imposed a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
The expected relaxation of the trade ban seeks to blunt mounting protests from 
Third World nations that the quarantine is too broad and potentially inhumane. 
The move came as a ship carrying food from India sought passage through the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials expressed the hope that tight restrictions in the U.N. plan for 
humanitarian aid could keep the embargo from leaking so badly that it would 
greatly prolong the economic siege of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, endorsed by the five permanent members of the Security Council and 
expected to be approved in a vote today, will require that any shipments to 
Iraq be authorized by a special U.N. committee and distributed by international 
relief workers, diplomats at the United Nations said. 
</P>
<P>
With U.N. officials barred by Iraq from surveying food needs, it remains far 
from clear how the program will be carried out. But the hurried effort to 
resolve the contentious debate over food aid offers a likely preview of future 
fractures as a diverse coalition of nations seeks to maintain common cause in 
an economic war against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in New York said the decision to take the matter to the Security 
Council was made after it became clear that a separate sanctions committee -- 
deadlocked when Cuba and Yemen insisted that food shipments begin immediately 
-- could not reach a consensus on the sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat said a clear majority of the 15-member Security Council is 
united behind the U.S.-sponsored plan in an effort to "address the humanitarian 
problem without opening the door too wide." But Cuban Ambassador Ricardo 
Alarcon voiced public dissent, declaring: "We don't have to wait for a famine." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bush expressed sympathy for the "incredible hardships" 
faced by the citizens of Iraq but blamed them on the Iraqi government. In an 
eight-minute speech videotaped for broadcast on Iraqi television, Bush 
emphasized that the United States has "no quarrel with the Iraqi people," a 
White House spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
And the State Department added new urgency to its plea for American women and 
children in Kuwait to leave the country as soon as possible as U.S. officials 
expressed concern that the current Iraqi-authorized evacuation may soon be 
forced to shut down. 
</P>
<P>
From Baghdad, however, there was another concession, as five Americans who had 
been detained were released into the custody of U.S. diplomats. They were 
expected to join an airlift of 286 other U.S. citizens scheduled to arrive in 
the United States today. About one third of the Americans in Iraq and Kuwait 
have now been evacuated, the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over food aid to Iraq represents the most important unresolved 
issue surrounding the sanctions imposed on Baghdad by the U.N. Security Council 
last month. An exception for "humanitarian" shipments of food was not further 
defined, leaving unresolved under what circumstances such aid might flow. 
</P>
<P>
But as the United States hoped openly that food shortages might turn Iraq 
against President Saddam Hussein, other nations -- particularly from the Third 
World -- have expressed mounting discomfort at the prospect of using food as a 
weapon. Their unease has raised the threat of cracks in the worldwide embargo. 
</P>
<P>
With U.S. officials concerned that any unauthorized leakage could quickly turn 
into an open flood, diplomats at the United Nations said the compromise reached 
Wednesday represented a bid to satisfy some of the discontent while retaining 
strict U.N. control over the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the diplomats said, the United States and other Western nations 
pledged that they would not object to the proposed massive Indian food shipment 
-- despite a belief that there is not yet a need for such humanitarian 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
But the diplomats said the United States, backed by the Soviet Union, insisted 
that the shipment be authorized only after agreement was reached on terms 
making clear that the Security Council alone had the right to grant such 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to avoid the kind of ad-hocery that could have blown the whole 
embargo apart," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian ambassador to the U.N. said the proposed shipment of some 11,000 
tons of food was intended to relieve the suffering of an estimated 140,000 
Indians and thousands of other foreigners stranded in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic show of support for the effort, about 40 Third World nations 
signed a document at the United Nations urging that the ship, now waiting at an 
Indian port, be permitted to proceed at once to Iraq in recognition of the 
"exceptional circumstances" there. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Iran and Turkey signaled a new willingness to open their 
borders to food shipments to neighboring Iraq, which has been forced to ration 
supplies of flour, sugar and other staples. 
</P>
<P>
Neither proposal made clear how such food is to be distributed. But U.S. 
officials said the mounting support for food aid has forced the United States 
to abandon hopes for unanimity and to take the plan to the Security Council -- 
despite the certain opposition of Cuba and Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
"There is one thing that everyone agrees on," one diplomat said, "and that is 
that the Security Council has to make sure that it cannot be blamed for 
pictures of starving babies." 
</P>
<P>
The speech videotaped by Bush on Wednesday morning, in which he spoke standing 
before his Oval Office desk, was made in response to an Iraqi offer to permit 
the President to address the people of Iraq over state-run television. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said it will wait five days for Iraq to broadcast the tape 
before making it available for use elsewhere. The eight-minute tape was to be 
presented to the Iraqi ambassador by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence 
Eagleburger this morning. 
</P>
<P>
A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested the 
speech was carefully written to throw back at Hussein a number of pledges he 
had made and broken. The official said that Bush also focused on the 
deprivations the Iraqi people suffered during the eight years of war that 
Hussein pursued against Iran. 
</P>
<P>
But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the speech is not a direct 
attack on Hussein and declared: "We expect that Iraq will honor its invitation 
to allow this to be addressed to the Iraqi people." 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the White House has more than one audience in mind. While it would 
like to have the tape reach the Iraqi people, it is also seen as a 
support-building mechanism if it were broadcast elsewhere in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
The White House spokesman said Bush worked on the speech text himself and 
discussed it in at least two sessions with aides from the State Department and 
the National Security Council staff. He was also said to have consulted outside 
experts on the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
"The President took this message very seriously," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The urgent new language in U.S.-sponsored radio broadcasts to Americans in 
Kuwait included an exhortation to women and children to contact the U.S. 
Embassy as soon as possible and a warning that the United States "cannot 
guarantee" how long the current airlift may continue. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials expressed concern that many of the estimated 1,200 
Americans still in Kuwait may have been too slow to make arrangements to leave. 
With the U.S. Embassy running low on food and water, they said, it is unclear 
how long the evacuation can continue. 
</P>
<P>
In reporting separately that two women and three children had been released 
from Iraqi custody in Baghdad on Wednesday, the State Department lowered to 
"about 80" its estimate of Americans held by Iraqi authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Richard Boucher also disclosed that a U.S. official had been 
permitted to meet for the first time with Miles Hoffman, the American shot and 
wounded by Iraqi forces in Kuwait last week while attempting to evade capture. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Hoffman, who suffered a broken bone in his left 
forearm, is doing "as well as can be expected." But he said Iraq has rebuffed 
American requests that the injured American be released and has moved him to an 
"undisclosed location."

BOY, 2, SHOT, APPARENTLY INTENTIONAL TARGET OF GANG; 
</P>
<P>

ALSO VICTIMS OF BULLETS.

A 2-year-old Lynwood boy was shot and critically wounded -- apparently on 
purpose -- as he played with a push toy in front of his home, authorities said 
Wednesday. He was one of four children shot in Los Angeles within the span of a 
few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathon Fabian was in critical but stable condition Wednesday at Martin Luther 
King Jr./Drew Medical Center. The toddler was struck in the stomach by a 
small-caliber bullet in the 4000 block of Platt Avenue Tuesday evening, said 
Sheriff's Deputy Kathleen Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Police suspected gang members, but the precise motivation for the shooting was 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
While increasing numbers of children are falling victim to random gang gunfire, 
Jonathon's shooting appeared to be one of the first incidents in which a child 
was the intended target, law enforcement authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just when you think you know the limits of the insanity, something like this 
happens," said Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Fred Nixon. "I have 
never heard of a deliberate gang shooting where the victim was of such a young 
age." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a 2-year-old considered a threat to anyone," added Sheriff's 
Detective Craig Ditsch, who is in charge of the investigation. "For the most 
part, gang members shoot other gang members and kids are sometimes shot 
accidentally." 
</P>
<P>
In other shootings of children, a 13-year-old was shot and killed and a 
16-year-old companion was wounded as they sat in a car in South Los Angeles 
waiting for a traffic light to change. A 7-year-old boy, caught in a gang 
cross-fire in South Los Angeles, was struck in the leg by a bullet. The 
incidents were believed to be unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
Few law enforcement agencies keep track of the ages of crime victims. However, 
gang-related homicides are rapidly increasing, gang experts say. As of 
Wednesday morning, for instance, there had been 116 gang-related murders 
reported in unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County this year, compared to 
112 in all of 1989. At this rate, officials believe, the number could reach 160 
or more by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"The boldness of gangs continues to escalate," said Steve Valdivia, executive 
director of Community Youth Gang Services. "They are shooting into homes, 
churches, at cops. It's getting to the point where the intended victims can be 
virtually anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathon Fabian was playing in a push-car about 6:50 p.m. Tuesday, his father 
standing a few yards away, when two shots rang out, according to authorities. 
Witnesses told sheriff's investigators that they saw three teen-age boys 
running away from the wounded child, one of them carrying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Police were puzzled by the attack. They took special notice of witnesses' 
reports that two shots had been fired at close range and that no other possible 
gang targets were standing nearby -- leading them to believe the 2-year-old was 
the target. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand it myself," said Sheriff's Detective Craig Ditsch. "I don't 
know if it was fun target practice or what." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors recalled how they had been out watering their lawns at the time and, 
turning toward the gunfire, saw Luis Fabian, 27, holding his son in his arms, a 
helpless expression on his face. 
</P>
<P>
"I went down there and found the father on the telephone, panicking, trying to 
communicate in Spanish with 911 operators, the phone in one hand and his 
bleeding child in the other," said Percy Ross, a superintendent with Caltrans. 
"I lifted the little boy's shirt and saw a bullet wound in his back. I yelled 
'Give me the phone!' " 
</P>
<P>
The boy was taken by paramedics to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the father has no gang affiliations and was not believed to be the 
intended target. 
</P>
<P>
For residents of this lower-middle-class enclave of ranch style homes, 
Jonathon's shooting was a tragic reminder of how much their once-quiet 
neighborhood has changed. Only last weekend, less than a block from the 
Fabians' home, neighbors said a group of young men stood on a corner, yelled 
out a gang slogan and opened fire on a passing car, critically wounding its 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
The toddler's 26-year-old mother, Yvonne Fabian, remembered. "A week ago we 
heard five shots in the same area my son was shot." 
</P>
<P>
Fabian, whose family moved into their small, yellow home only three weeks ago, 
said she only recently started allowing Jonathon and his baby sister to play in 
the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to keep my children in the back yard but that was like keeping them in 
jail," she said, standing at her front door, her eyes brimming with tears. "All 
I care about now is that my son gets well.' 
</P>
<P>
Another mother, whose four children are grown but who now cares for four 
grandchildren, stood in her doorway Wednesday and looked out warily at the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to do except pray for all the children, " she said, refusing 
to give her name out of fear the gang members might return. " . . . Once they 
lose their life, they can't reach back and get another one. And what are they 
losing it for? Silliness." 
</P>
<P>
While police believe the shooting was intentional, teen-agers on the street 
said that the boy might have been the accidental victim of an escalating war 
between rival gangs, one black and one Latino, for whom Platt Avenue is 
becoming the main battleground. 
</P>
<P>
"After school last night, the blacks and the Mexicans were after each other," 
said a 17-year-old Lynwood high school student, who asked not to be identified. 
"The blacks and the Latinos used to be together. But something happened." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathon lay crying in King/Drew Medical Center's pediatric unit Wednesday, his 
father trying to comfort him with a white teddy bear. "He's going to pull out 
of it," Luis Fabian said. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours after Jonathon was brought to the hospital, 13-year-old Claudette 
Ku, 13 arrived by ambulance with a mortal gunshot wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Claudette had been shot about midnight Tuesday as she rode down 82nd Street, 
sitting between her 16-year-old boyfriend, Carlos Perez, and an unidentified 
driver, both of whom are gang members, said Los Angeles police officials. 
</P>
<P>
The car stopped at a light and was about to make a right turn onto Hoover when 
a white Buick Regal pulled up beside it with two men inside, police detectives 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where you . . . from?," one of them asked Claudette and her companions, police 
said. Before they could answer, one of the men in the Buick raised a sawed-off 
rifle and fired one round into their car. The bullet missed the driver, but hit 
Claudette, passing through her head and striking her boyfriend in the face, 
police said. The girl died Wednesday morning. Carlos Perez was in stable but 
serious condition at an undisclosed hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a 7-year-old boy was in good condition Wednesday at Kaiser Sunset 
Medical Center in Los Angeles after being shot in the leg Tuesday night. Police 
said a neighbor, who is a suspected gang member, fired several shots at a 
passing car, missed, and hit the youngster, who was riding his bicycle.

CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR SET 2 DEBATE DATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Setting up events that could prove pivotal in their neck-and-neck race for 
governor, Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein jointly announced Wednesday that 
they will meet in televised debates twice next month. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued by both campaigns, the candidates set Oct. 7 and 18 
as debate dates. The first of the two hour-long sessions will be held in the 
Burbank studios of television station KNBC, and the second in San Francisco at 
KPIX, the CBS affiliate in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
In a break from what has become the expected debate format, the candidates said 
that half of each session will be set aside for exchanges in which Democrat 
Feinstein and Republican Wilson will question each other. 
</P>
<P>
The other half of each debate will feature the candidates responding to 
questions posed by a panel of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two campaigns have been engaged in quiet 
behind-the-scenes negotiating sessions since August, apparently finding much 
common ground even as Wilson and Feinstein bickered publicly over issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides met in good faith and both candidates desired to get this nailed 
down with a minimum of trouble," said Wilson's campaign director, Otto Bos. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's campaign director, Bill Carrick, said there were no substantial 
disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Dianne is going to feel comfortable and Wilson is a veteran debater," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two debates, which will be open to any subject, are expected to be the only 
head-to-head sessions between the two, despite the avalanche of requests that 
have buried each of the campaigns. Among other groups, the California League of 
Conservation Voters has pressed the candidates to gather to discuss 
environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is about it, given the campaign schedules and other campaign 
demands," Carrick said. Each session not only requires the candidates to 
dedicate an hour to film the debate, but also generally requires them to study 
briefing books for days ahead of time, cutting into the time they can give to 
campaign events and fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Wilson had challenged Feinstein to debate him and set aside 
Oct. 7 and 17 as potential dates. The first date was agreed to by Feinstein, 
and the second was moved back a day to avoid conflicting with the televising of 
the second game of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
The first debate, to be held on a Sunday at 6 p.m., will be sponsored by the 
California Assn. of Broadcasters, which months ago offered to sponsor a 
meeting. The second, an 8 p.m. Thursday session, will be sponsored by KPIX. The 
panel of reporters will be picked from a pool submitted by both campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Carrick said the campaign representatives were unsuccessful in efforts to have 
both of the debates -- rather than just the San Francisco event -- aired before 
prime time viewing audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"Our desire, the Feinstein campaign's desire, was to try to have debates which 
would reach the largest number of Californians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Feinstein and her Democratic primary opponent, Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp, took part in two debates that were out-watched by virtually every 
other television program on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem was that major Southern California stations chose not to 
air the first debate, which was broadcast from San Francisco. And Northern 
California stations generally did not air the second debate, which was beamed 
from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the stations airing the upcoming debates have pledged to offer their 
signal to other stations, but there is no firm indication whether viewers from 
different areas will be able to watch both debates. 
</P>
<P>
In another campaign development, the Wilson campaign on Wednesday began airing 
another campaign commercial, this one a 30-second advertisement touting 
Wilson's Senate record in support of legislation aiding so-called "crack 
babies," the offspring of addicted mothers.

IRAN PLAYING A STRONG HAND IN GULF GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iran, hard-pressed to beat a pair of deuces just a few months back, now holds 
some aces in the Persian Gulf game. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is pressing peace on Iran like a smitten suitor, trying to brush away the 
animosity of a decade of grinding war and hostile truce. At the same time, the 
oil-rich gulf sheikdoms that once bankrolled Iraq have recently entertained 
Iranian emissaries. 
</P>
<P>
The winning hand, a breakout from diplomatic isolation in the West and 
even-handed treatment from the Arab world, may be in the cards. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say they're playing it well," said Don Kerr, an analyst with London's 
International Institute of Strategic Studies. "We're talking about the Middle 
East, and the Iranians will keep all options open as long as they can." 
</P>
<P>
Describing the Iranians, along with the Syrians, as among the subtlest players 
in the region, Kerr explained that the ruling clerics in Tehran, the Iranian 
capital, have seen "an opportunity to improve their position -- and they're 
going after it." 
</P>
<P>
The approach seems contradictory, however: In succession, Iran has condemned 
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and demanded a withdrawal; accepted President 
Saddam Hussein's offer of peace and restoration of diplomatic relations, and 
voiced alarm over the buildup of Western military forces in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Now official hints and unconfirmed news reports indicate that Iran is prepared 
to crack the U.N.-mandated sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"But that should not mean the Iranians are prepared to get into bed with 
Saddam," Kerr observed. "They're natural rivals, even without hostility. This 
goes back thousands of years. There are people out there who talk in current 
terms about the destruction of Nineveh." 
</P>
<P>
(The ancient city of Nineveh, on the Tigris River in what is now northern Iraq, 
was the capital of the Assyrian Empire. Its capture in 612 BC by a coalition of 
peoples, including Medes from what is now western Iran, marked the end of the 
empire.) 
</P>
<P>
Tehran, of course, is looking out for its own interests. Peace with Iraq, on 
Iranian terms, was an offer that could not be refused. And unease with Western 
naval, ground and air forces in the gulf region is instinctively political, 
because Tehran, like Baghdad, opposes outside domination of the waterway. 
</P>
<P>
The probability that Iran will ship some food and medicines to its old enemy is 
based on Islamic and humanitarian principles, and it is a position with growing 
acceptance in many Arab countries. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to balance a delicate situation," observed Shireen T. Hunter, 
a Middle East specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies 
in Washington. "They have to be very careful. But by and large, I think they'll 
abide by the embargo." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Iran has given nothing except the implied assurance that it will not 
pose a threat to the Iraqi flank while Hussein deals with the dangerous 
confrontation over his occupation of Kuwait. And Iraq has hedged against that 
assurance, reportedly keeping seven army corps of up to four divisions each 
along the 800-mile border. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, meanwhile, has withdrawn its troops from 100 square miles of Iranian 
territory held since the August, 1988, cease-fire and has agreed to share 
control of the strategic Shatt al Arab waterway that forms the southern 
frontier of the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian action in the crisis has ruffled few feathers. American and British 
naval officers in the Persian Gulf say the Iranians are active, but not 
aggressive. Iranian pilots are flying American-made P-3 Orion reconnaissance 
planes along their shores, watching the foreign warships, but Tehran's 
patrol-boat navy has made no threatening move. 
</P>
<P>
But while Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani maintains a strong centrist grip 
on his country's politics, some radical voices are still being raised. In 
Parliament on Monday, opposition Deputy Sadegh Khalkhali, a former judge and 
longtime Washington-baiter, said the weekend visit of Iraqi Foreign Minister 
Tarik Aziz, the first by a top Baghdad official since Iran's 1979 Islamic 
revolution, "flung wide open the door of solidarity and unity between the 
peoples of Iran and Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "The United States must leave this region in humiliation and 
disgrace. This region belongs to Muslims." 
</P>
<P>
And on Wednesday, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, called 
for a "holy war" against the American military forces in the gulf. A Tehran 
Radio broadcast, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., said the 
religious primate of Iran's Muslims promised martyrdom for anyone killed 
opposing the U.S. presence. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rafsanjani also opposes the presence of the Western fleet, but he 
reminded Aziz that the invasion of Kuwait brought on this situation. He 
accepted the benefits of peace in their own war and called again on Iraq to 
withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the potential promise of food and medical supplies has yet to 
materialize. The Tehran Times said Wednesday that the Rafsanjani regime, whose 
policies the Tehran Times reflects, is "studying the issue," and it added: 
"Iranian officials are convinced that the Muslim Iraqi people should not pay 
for the mistakes of their government. Iraqi women and children had no role in 
the occupation of Kuwait by Baghdad troops.' 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press, quoting what it termed a well-informed source in Tehran, 
reported that in return for food and medical supplies, Iraq will ship refined 
oil to Iran, whose refinery capacity at Abadan and other cities was damaged 
severely by Iraqi shelling during the 1980-88 war. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, the Washington analyst, called the situation in Iran after the 1988 
truce "very emotional." The military had collapsed, the economy was devastated 
and, she said, the attitude in Europe and the United States was that Iran would 
abandon its independent policies "and come crawling back." 
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War, the strategically placed country of 50 million 
people no longer had a high profile in world affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The economic situation has gotten little better, with inflation and 
unemployment detracting from efforts to rebuild the ruined industrial sector. 
Oil remains the only important source of revenue, and it has provided Tehran 
with an unexpected windfall, with Iraqi and Kuwaiti exports embargoed and world 
prices rising. 
</P>
<P>
Iran has continued to hold to its OPEC pricing policy on oil, similar to 
Iraq's, of controlled production to reach and maintain a target price. The 
Saudi Arabian decision to pump more oil to compensate for blocked Iraqi and 
Kuwaiti shipments was opposed by Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Times said in an editorial: "It is in fact a service to the U.S. and 
its Western allies and an effort to protect the Saud ruling family and their 
reign in Saudi Arabia. . . . There is a lot of oil in the international markets 
and in tankers floating on the high seas." 
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim Chalabi was in Aziz's 
delegation in Tehran over the weekend and suggested that his presence signaled 
continued agreement on oil policy between Baghdad and Tehran. Chalabi also 
could have been on hand to arrange the reported shipments of Iraqi refined oil 
to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Other news reports have suggested that Iran might help Iraq break the oil 
embargo by transferring Iraqi crude to Iranian pipelines for delivery beyond 
the blockade zone. Kerr, the London analyst, said he doubts that Iran would 
want to make that commitment, which could potentially risk a blockade of Iran's 
shipping points. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iranians don't want to side with Saddam," Hunter said. "If he's 
victorious, what's to stop him from turning against them again? He's the same 
guy who signed the Algiers Agreement (which divided the Shatt al Arab between 
Iran and Iraq), and then he tore it up and went to war."

CRISIS MAKING POLITICIANS RUN ON ISSUES OF THE PAST

EAST LANSING, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Democratic Sen. Carl Levin debated Republican Rep. Bill Schuette, his 
reelection opponent, here last week, virtually the only subject on which they 
agreed was President Bush's decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
No big surprise there. But what was notable was what they did argue about -- 
energy policy and defense spending -- subjects that were politically comatose 
until Iraq invaded Kuwait last month. By contrast, the two candidates brushed 
past abortion and the environment -- two issues originally expected to burn 
brightly this fall. And the constitutionality of flag-burning -- a question 
that ignited passions only three months ago -- never came up. 
</P>
<P>
As in Michigan, candidates across the country are aggressively employing the 
developments in the Mideast to sharpen their differences, even when they agree 
on the deployment itself. In the process, the Persian Gulf crisis is reviving 
partisan disputes that were more common when Jimmy Carter sat in the Oval 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
In Illinois, GOP Rep. Lynn Martin has slammed Sen. Paul Simon for supporting 
large cuts in the defense budget -- a position that appeared politically 
unassailable only weeks ago. In Kentucky, Democratic challenger Harvey Sloane 
and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell have ripped each other for financial ties 
to the oil industry, whose standing as a political demon had shrunk along with 
oil prices in the mid-1980s. "The oil companies have become worse than the 
savings and loans," Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
In Michigan, where these themes have converged, the Senate contest has taken on 
overtones of a political race back to the future. Both candidates have 
aggressively employed the new circumstances to reinforce their long-standing 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Schuette, 36, an attractive and energetic three-term representative from the 
north central part of the state, faces an uphill battle to unseat Levin, 56, a 
shrewd and rumpled graduate of gritty Detroit politics who was first elected to 
the Senate in 1978. Levin leads Schuette by more than 2 to 1, according to a 
Detroit News poll released this week. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the campaign, Schuette has been relying heavily on the polarizing 
"wedge" issues that Bush used in 1988 to portray Democrat Michael S. Dukakis as 
an elitist liberal ideologue. Since early this spring, Schuette has 
persistently attacked Levin for opposition to the death penalty, uncertainty on 
flag-burning and for refusing to rule out new taxes, hoping to convince voters 
that "Levin is a man who stands 180 degrees from the beliefs and values of the 
mainstream of Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
That case has been difficult to make against Levin, whose affable frumpiness 
effectively armors him against accusations of trendy elitism. And, with the 
Soviet threat imploding, Schuette was denied one of Bush's sharpest wedges -- 
national defense. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the emergence of the new threat in the gulf, Schuette, like Martin 
and other GOP challengers, has nimbly resuscitated the traditional Republican 
complaint that Democrats are dangerously soft on defense. At last week's 
debate, Schuette repeatedly hammered Levin for not supporting the military 
buildup pursued by Ronald Reagan and Bush. Although Levin has endorsed the 
President's moves in the Mideast, Schuette charged, he "never gives us the 
means for a strong national defense." 
</P>
<P>
Schuette may have found a potent symbol for his case when he criticized the 
senator for standing on the deck of the battleship Wisconsin during an early 
September tour through the combat zone, although Levin had voted against 
recommissioning the ship in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Levin is not totally defenseless against the charge of being soft on national 
security. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on conventional 
forces, he frequently notes, he has supported shifting resources from nuclear 
to conventional weapons -- the relevant measure of strength in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, few Democratic strategists had hoped to spend the fall debating 
military preparedness. To the extent that the agenda has shifted from cutting 
defense spending to ensuring America's security against unanticipated threats, 
"it has taken the argument away from the Democrats," said Republican pollster 
Alex Gage, who is advising Schuette. 
</P>
<P>
But, if the crisis has freed Republicans to strike old poses on national 
defense, it has also enabled Democrats to dust off their invective against Big 
Oil. 
</P>
<P>
For Levin, that presents an opportunity to underscore his basic campaign theme. 
While Schuette has tried to polarize the race around cultural issues, Levin, 
like many Democrats this year, has sought to divide the electorate on economic 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
To cement his links with swing blue-collar voters -- conservative on social 
issues but suspicious of the wealthy and big business -- Levin has stressed 
such populist issues as trade and tax "fairness." Now, the rise in gasoline 
prices has presented him with perhaps his most compelling populist villain. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's debate, Schuette proposed to ease the energy price rise by 
offering domestic oil companies more incentives to drill for new supplies -- in 
effect arguing that the proper response to soaring prices is tax breaks. But 
Levin swung for the gut, declaring that "we ought to sock it to the oil 
companies in every way we possibly can. They're gouging the heck out of us. We 
. . . ought to have a windfall profits tax on their excess profits." 
</P>
<P>
Few here doubt that Levin won that exchange. "The farmers are bitching about 
(oil prices), the bankers are bitching about it, working folks don't understand 
it," said state Rep. Bob Emerson (D-Flint). "Everybody's mad at the oil 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
The Mideast crisis has also intensified fears of an imminent recession in the 
state, where slipping car sales had induced jitters even before the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
That economic anxiety represents the wild card in this race, as in many others 
around the nation. Republicans hope it will strengthen their anti-tax and 
time-for-a-change arguments. Schuette has already put Levin on the defensive 
for previously endorsing an oil import fee and has pledged not to support any 
budget agreement that includes new taxes. If such an agreement is reached 
before Election Day, and Levin votes for new taxes, "all of a sudden, it would 
be a close race," said Republican consultant Tom Shields. 
</P>
<P>
But, short of such a dramatic development, most Michigan analysts feel that 
voters here will do what they usually do when they feel a cold economic gale 
gathering: lean toward Democrats who promise them shelter against hard times. 
Of all the political winds now blowing from the Persian Gulf, that may prove 
the most powerful.

DISCOVERY MAY AID DETECTION OF DIABETES; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENCE: ANTIBODIES TO PROTEIN IDENTIFIED BY RESEARCHERS ARE PRESENT IN THE 
BLOODSTREAM AS LONG AS SEVEN YEARS BEFORE DISEASE DEVELOPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A major step toward the identification of individuals likely to develop 
insulin-dependent diabetes is reported today by researchers from UC San 
Francisco and Yale University. Physicians hope that earlier detection of 
potential diabetics will allow intervention and prevent development of the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
The research team has identified a protein in the pancreas that is destroyed by 
an individual's immune system, thereby causing the disease, according to a 
report in the British journal Nature. Antibodies to this protein are present in 
the bloodstream as long as seven years before diabetes develops, making it 
possible to identify individuals who are almost certain to develop the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big deal . . . a very exciting piece of news," said pathologist Noel 
Maclaren of the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have recently begun clinical trials using drugs such as 
azathioprine to suppress the so-called autoimmune attack in such individuals, 
hoping to forestall the onset of diabetes and give the patients at least 
several additional years without the need for daily injections of insulin. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians are now using relatively crude tests for antibodies against insulin 
to identify individuals who will receive the treatment, but such procedures 
miss many potential victims. 
</P>
<P>
Tests for antibodies against the newly identified protein, which should be 
available in a few months, are expected to be much more accurate in identifying 
potential diabetics, improving the odds that the screening process will 
identify all individuals likely to develop the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Identification of the protein may also make possible other ways to interfere 
with the autoimmune attack, such as by selectively destroying antibodies 
directed against it. 
</P>
<P>
"This really puts out hope for us being able to come to terms with the immune 
response that leads to diabetes," said Robert E. Silverman, head of the 
diabetes branch at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases in Bethesda, Md. "It's pregnant with possibilities for potential 
breakthroughs." 
</P>
<P>
Between 750,000 and 1 million Americans suffer from insulin-dependent diabetes, 
also known as juvenile-onset or Type 1 diabetes, according to the American 
Diabetic Assn., and 13,000 to 15,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. 
</P>
<P>
Although insulin injections can control the overt symptoms -- such as excessive 
thirst and urination -- that can lead to coma, most diabetics eventually 
develop serious complications, including kidney damage, nerve damage in the 
arms and legs and vision loss. By preventing, or at least delaying, the onset 
of the disease with the immune-suppressing drug, researchers hope to reduce the 
severity of these complications. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have known about the newly identified protein, which has been 
called the 64K protein because of its size, for several years. Researchers 
around the world have been trying to isolate and purify the protein, but this 
has been extremely difficult because it occurs in very low quantities in the 
pancreas. 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came from an unexpected source. Biologist Pietro De Camilli, 
now at Yale in New Haven, Conn., and formerly at the University of Milan in 
Italy, has been studying a seemingly unrelated autoimmune disorder called 
"stiff-man syndrome." That very rare disease of the central nervous system, 
which affects perhaps only 300 people worldwide, is characterized by 
progressive rigidity and painful spasms of muscles throughout the body. 
</P>
<P>
The Yale team reported in May that patients with stiff-man syndrome showed very 
high concentrations of antibodies against an enzyme called glutamic acid 
decarboxylase (GAD), which plays a vital role in brain cells that are important 
in muscle activity. 
</P>
<P>
Three key factors led to the conclusion that GAD was the 64K protein. First, as 
many as 20% of the individuals with stiff-man syndrome were also diabetic, De 
Camilli discovered, a much higher percentage than in the population at large. 
</P>
<P>
Second, GAD is also found in the insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas. "That 
is practically the only place outside the nervous system where there is a 
significant concentration of the enzyme," De Camilli said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
And third, GAD is the same size as the 64K protein. 
</P>
<P>
Based on these factors, De Camilli contacted immunologist Steinunn Baekkeskov 
of UC San Francisco, who was attempting to isolate the 64K protein. "The 
collaboration very quickly resulted in the demonstration that the two proteins 
were the same," he said.

EXXON VALDEZ EXITS SAN DIEGO WITH NEW NAME 
</P>

<P>
Delayed first by environmentalists and then by the environment itself, the 
former Exxon Valdez left San Diego Bay six hours later than planned Wednesday, 
returning to service after 14 months of repairs with a new name, a new route 
and yet another encounter with Greenpeace under its belt. 
</P>
<P>
In an elaborate pre-dawn send-off, members of the environmental activist group 
scaled the side of the tanker, rechristened the Exxon Mediterranean, and 
unfurled a banner that read "Sane Energy: When?" Two demonstrators, handcuffed 
to each other, perched atop the huge rudder, while six more attempted to block 
the ship's passage by forming a human oil boom in the chilly water. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Harbor Police officers quickly quashed the demonstration, arresting 
nine of an estimated 40 protesters, according to Chief Arthur Le Blanc. But by 
the time divers could confirm that demonstrators had not damaged the newly 
repaired hull of the tanker that caused the nation's worst oil spill, Exxon 
faced another problem: fog. 
</P>
<P>
"It was thick. Two hundred feet from the pier, (the ship) disappeared," said 
Fred Hallett, the vice president of National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., 
where the ship was built and received $30 million in repairs. "Somebody said, 
'She's gone.' And then the captain held her out in the channel for more than an 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
At noon, after the fog lifted, the 987-foot Exxon Mediterranean finally set 
sail for Singapore -- its first stop before heading to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Exxon officials announced that because of a declining need to 
transport Alaskan crude oil, the embattled tanker would become the first 
U.S.-licensed tanker to enter foreign service. It will load Middle Eastern oil 
in the Mediterranean and deliver it to Europe, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics charged that the reassignment was a public relations move designed to 
distance the ship from Alaska's Prince William Sound, where it ran aground on 
March 24, 1989, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil and tearing up 
one-third of its hull. 
</P>
<P>
But Exxon officials said good business sense, not image-building, predicated 
the change. On Wednesday, Les Rogers, a spokesman for Exxon Shipping Co., 
seemed unfazed by the protests and delays, saying he was just pleased that the 
vessel was on its way. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready for the voyage," he said, noting that the Mediterranean had 
demonstrated its seaworthiness in 10 days of ocean trials that ended last week.

A Santa Ana woman gave birth to quadruplets at UC Irvine Medical Center here 
Wednesday afternoon, the second foursome to be born this year at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the ones that arrived last Feb. 10, the boy and three girls born 
prematurely Wednesday to 28-year-old Consolacion (Solly) Amante were not the 
result of fertility treatments, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The chances of such "spontaneous" quadruplets is about 1 in 512,000 births, 
said Dr. Manuel Porto, the obstetrician who delivered the Amante infants by 
Cesarean section shortly after 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though she had seen the sonograms and we had gone over it, there's still 
that surreal aspect to it. She didn't really believe it until they were there 
-- four babies," said Porto. 
</P>
<P>
The quadruplets, who were born 10 weeks prematurely, were in serious but stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Jeremy Stewart, the biggest at 3 pounds, 9 1/2 ounces, arrived first. 
Seconds later came a 2-pound, 14 1/2-ounce girl named Jeraldine Elaine. Then 
Jessamine Eileen weighed in at 2 pounds, 14 1/2 ounces. Last was 2-pound, 
12-ounce Jacqueline Elise. 
</P>
<P>
Their father, Oscar Amante, 30, who workes for a computer printer manufacturing 
firm in Irvine, was present for the births. "At first I thought it couldn't be 
happening to us, but it's great," he said. "Our entire family is very excited." 
</P>
<P>
The Amantes also have a son, Jonathan, 4, and a daughter, Jane, 1. 
</P>
<P>
The previous set of quadruplets arrived at UC Irvine on Feb. 10 to Karen Miner, 
a 32-year-old schoolteacher from Orange. They were the county's first set of 
quadruplets to be born through a non-test-tube fertility technique known as 
GIFT, which involves placing sperm and eggs in the mother's Fallopian tubes.

S.D. SPARED AS DENSE SMOG STIFLES L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: IT'S BEEN A SCORCHER IN SAN DIEGO, TOO, BUT THE COUNTY HAS ESCAPED 
MOST OF THE SMOG THAT HAS CHOKED RESIDENTS OF THE LOS ANGELES BASIN.

<P>
The Los Angeles area this week has been plunged into a merciless plague of heat 
and smog that has obliterated skylines, sending a few disgruntled tourists 
packing for home and leaving some residents literally gasping for clean air. 
</P>
<P>
First-stage smog alerts have been posted in parts of the San Gabriel and San 
Fernando valleys for five of the past seven days. In downtown Los Angeles, 
visibility has been limited to a few miles, with the San Gabriel Mountains lost 
in a sea of brown haze. 
</P>
<P>
The foul air was just as foul Wednesday, with "unhealthful" air in 12 of the 34 
air-monitoring areas of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
including normally clear West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County was at the center of the high-pressure system responsible for 
the Southern California heat wave, but the county largely was spared from the 
smog, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The highest pollution reading all week was Alpine's level of 125 on Wednesday, 
right in the middle of the standard pollution index range considered 
"unhealthful." 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, air pollution levels in the Los Angeles area have been above 
200. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, El Cajon was the only area in San Diego County to reach 100 on the 
pollution scale, said Bob Goggin, public information spokesman for the San 
Diego County Air Pollution Control District. Between 51 and 100 is considered 
"moderate." 
</P>
<P>
Other readings Wednesday included 84 at Escondido, 75 at Kearney Mesa and 50 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The only other readings at the unhealthful level over the last week were at 
Alpine on Sept. 8, in El Cajon on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
But throughout the Los Angeles area, playground games have been canceled and 
pedestrians have protected themselves from the unrelenting sun and contaminated 
air with parasols and wet handkerchiefs. Those who could avoided the smog 
altogether by staying indoors. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Civic Center posted a high of 94 degrees, the ninth consecutive 
day of plus-90 degree weather. The inland valleys fared even worse, with highs 
reaching 105 in Riverside and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Lewis' work as a garbage-truck driver took him to what was arguably the 
most unpleasant place to be on a hot, smoggy day -- high atop 500 feet of trash 
at the Sunshine Canyon Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
As a light wind kicked up a cloud of dust amid the sea of disposable diapers 
and plastic trash bags, Lewis watched bulldozers cover his load of garbage with 
a layer of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep the trash covered up pretty good, so you don't have too much 
stench," said Lewis, 56. "It's the smog and the fumes from all these trucks 
that bothers me. . . . The heat isn't that bad. It's nothing like what the 
fellas are suffering in Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
What's causing the hellish weather? Joe Cassmassi, a weatherman with the AQMD 
described the conditions in the atmosphere above Los Angeles as "worst-case 
meteorology." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, temperatures near the century mark break up the inversion layer that 
holds pollutants close to the ground. But this week, a high-pressure system 
centered over San Diego has kept the inversion layer intact, leading to the 
unusual combination of smog and near-100-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
Even the usually pleasant beach communities have been affected by the smog 
siege, Cassmassi said. "You have to get out of L.A. pretty much, and even out 
of Orange County to get away from the smog." 
</P>
<P>
For those out-of-towners visiting the Los Angeles area, Wednesday's dirty air 
and heat seemed a far cry from the pleasant, post-card vistas they had seen in 
the travel agent's office back home. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Steven, a 21-year-old tourist from Scotland, sat in the shade of a kiosk 
at the front entrance to the Huntington Library in San Marino, resting after a 
midday walk that unexpectedly became a desert-like trek. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost unbearable," she said. "I expected brilliant sunshine and clear 
skies. It's been kind of a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Prigatamo, a volunteer who collects donations for the library, offered the 
weary tourist a glass of water. It wasn't the first time Prigatamo had rescued 
a pedestrian from the heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a woman and her child approached Prigatamo's kiosk on foot. 
The woman said she was from Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her, 'You walked all the way from Switzerland in this heat, that's 
crazy,' " Prigatamo said, laughing. "But seriously," he added, "another person 
walked from the Norton Simon Museum (in Pasadena). Now that's a long way." 
</P>
<P>
Some Los Angelenos appeared to be taking it all in stride, greeting the the 
perennial summer-ending smog siege an heat wave with the same aplomb reserved 
for rush-hour traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Urquisa, 29, spent Wednesday installing a sprinkler system at Cal Tech. 
After three days of working shirtless in the hot sun, his skin was burnt bright 
red. But he didn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like been to the beach," he said in Spanish. "Sure you can feel the heat. 
But you get used to it."

IRANIAN AYATOLLAH URGES HOLY WAR AGAINST U.S. BUILDUP 
</P>

<P>
The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, declared Wednesday that 
opposition to the American military presence in the Persian Gulf region is a 
Muslim "holy war," and he labeled U.S. policy "greedy, bullying and shameless." 
</P>
<P>
Any Muslim killed in the struggle against U.S. forces will be a martyr, Tehran 
Radio quoted Khamenei as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The surprisingly harsh indictment of the U.S. military buildup topped mounting 
Iranian concern over the deployment of Western warships in the gulf in response 
to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has called for a holy war, or jihad, against the 
American troops defending Saudi Arabia. The sheik of Mecca has in turn demanded 
a jihad against Iraq. Khamenei's remarks, as monitored by the British 
Broadcasting Corp., appeared likely to increase the tension. 
</P>
<P>
However, there was no indication from the reported remarks that Khamenei, 
successor to Iran's late revolutionary leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, 
was calling for Iran's armed forces to join the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who fights America's aggression, its greediness and its plans to 
encroach on the Persian Gulf region has engaged in jihad in the cause of 
Allah," the religious leader said, "and anyone who is killed on that path is a 
martyr." Martyrdom has special meaning to Muslims, a promise of direct ascent 
to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
To the Western world, Muslim martyrdom in the Middle East raises the specter of 
suicide attacks, and Khamenei played directly to those fears, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"It's surprising how the Americans don't take lessons. They saw how vulnerable 
their presence can be. Have they forgotten how a bunch of pious Muslim youth -- 
just that -- swept them away and evicted them from Lebanon?" 
</P>
<P>
He referred to the 1983 suicide truck-bombing of a U.S. Marine barracks at 
Beirut airport that killed 241 American servicemen. If Khamenei's remarks were 
more than hyperbole -- and to anti-American Muslim listeners they could be -- 
he has introduced a dangerous element into the bristling confrontation over the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Tehran Radio did not identify Khamenei's audience. 
</P>
<P>
Since their deployment, American and other Western forces have taken 
precautions against possible commando strikes. The majority, on board about 50 
warships in the region or in the deserts of Saudi Arabia, would prove difficult 
targets, but military personnel on leave or American civilians could prove 
vulnerable in gulf cities. 
</P>
<P>
No other Iranian leader has taken such a bellicose line in the conflict. The 
ayatollah often speaks with a moderate voice, particularly on economic issues, 
but has made heated remarks against Western influence in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran has attempted to walk a policy tightrope between its antipathy to 
foreign forces in the area, particularly American, and its opposition to the 
invasion of Kuwait by a longtime enemy, Iraq. Iraqi-occupied Kuwait presents a 
major strategic threat to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's promise of peace with Iran was backed up last weekend by Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz, who was in Tehran as the first top official from 
Baghdad to go to Iran since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. Aziz offered to 
normalize relations between the two oil-producing gulf powers that fought a 
brutal war from 1980 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In consultations with Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, the Iraqi 
reportedly raised the prospect of food shipments through Iran in defiance of 
U.N. sanctions.

The U.S. troop deployment to Saudi Arabia has been a massive undertaking by any 
measure. Over the last five weeks, steady streams of cargo ships have unloaded 
hundreds of tanks and other equipment to bolster U.S. ground forces there. 
</P>
<P>
But the sea lift has become so large that Navy transportation strategists have 
found they need more fast roll-on, roll-off cargo vessels to keep up the pace 
-- and they are thinking seriously about chartering a large Soviet version of 
the ship, now docked in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
The incident may seem ironic -- another example of the Cold War thaw -- but it 
serves to illustrate a point: 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States spent billions during the early 1980s bolstering its 
armed forces, the buildup was shaped primarily to deal with a Soviet nuclear 
attack or an invasion of Western Europe -- not a flare-up in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
While officials insist that American troops and equipment are generally 
well-suited for possible engagement with Iraqi forces, they concede that the 
United States is finding it still has some important needs -- such as more sea- 
and airlift capacity, lighter tanks, more offense-oriented aircraft carriers 
and better protective gear against chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"We have designed a military force to fight in Europe," Senate Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said shortly after returning from a tour of 
U.S. forces on the Arabian peninsula. "That force was a heavy force, heavy 
tanks, M-1 tanks." 
</P>
<P>
But as Nunn conceded ruefully, the effective but ponderous M-1s don't lend 
themselves to the kind of rapid deployment that the United States needs in the 
Persian Gulf and are too big to be flown in swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
"The first M-1 tanks were just arriving the day I was there," he said -- three 
weeks after the deployment began. "We have a lot of rethinking to do about our 
military strategy." 
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf crisis erupted right in the middle of a fledgling debate over 
what kind of troops and equipment the United States should have in the 
aftermath of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate last month passed a military spending bill designed to begin the job 
of reshaping U.S. forces for new contingencies. And the House is expected to 
begin debate on its version as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
But while Congress probably will not make any major changes until fiscal 1992, 
when strategists know more about Soviet intentions and the emerging challenges 
in the Middle East, some programs seem likely to win a significant boost as a 
result of the gulf experience. 
</P>
<P>
The House Armed Services Committee has launched a detailed study of the 
military's post-Cold War needs, but Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), the panel's 
chairman, and Nunn both have some ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are: 
</P>
<P>
More rapid sea-lift cargo ships to make the deployment of equipment easier. The 
United States now has eight such vessels. "If we have twice as many fast 
roll-on, roll-off ships, we can move twice as many divisions in the same amount 
of time," Aspin said. 
</P>
<P>
Creation of a new tank-like vehicle that can be moved more easily than the M-1s 
that are now stationed in Europe. "What we're looking at is some vehicle that 
can be moved a lot easier than what we've had in Europe. We can only put one 
M-1 in the C-5" cargo plane, Aspin said. "We're moving against the tide of 
having to build another main battle tank." 
</P>
<P>
A new boost for the C-17, a giant cargo plane being built by McDonnell Douglas 
Corp. in Long Beach as a successor to the aging C-141 -- and designed to fly 
faster and land in much tighter spots with bigger payloads. President Bush 
requested procurement of six C-17s at a cost of $1.7 billion in fiscal 1991, 
which begins Oct. 1. Both the Senate-passed defense authorization bill and the 
House Armed Services Committee version defers procurement because of the 
plane's development and testing delays. 
</P>
<P>
A shift to "lighter, more lethal" U.S. forces to replace existing ground units, 
which are either too heavy and too slow to deploy or else lack sufficient 
firepower, endurance and ground mobility. "The Army and the Marine Corps need 
to go on a diet," Nunn said in a recent floor speech. "We have the 
technological potential to permit the Army and the Marine Corps to get the 
weight of their combat forces back to 1980 levels by the year 2000, and with 
improved firepower and survivability." 
</P>
<P>
Revamping U.S. strategy for aircraft carriers to make them more offensive, 
rather than defensive. Nunn wants to add more fighter-bombers and reduce the 
number of planes assigned to defend them and surrounding ships from assault. 
"We ought to be considering taking some of our carriers and making them much 
more Third World-oriented," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Improved gear for use against chemical weapons, particularly in the face of the 
threat posed by Iraqi troops, who have used such weapons before. "We have had a 
better design of gear available for several years," said Michael Brower, an 
analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists. "The gear we have now has 
several layers of material that does not breathe outside air. It is a terrible 
burden for troops." 
</P>
<P>
Retired Navy Capt. James Bush, associate director of the liberal Center for 
Defense Information, asserts that "the military plans we have today are 
inadequate for the post-Cold War area." 
</P>
<P>
He called for scrapping provisions of the 1947 National Security Act, which he 
said have tied U.S. forces so rigidly to areas such as Europe, South Korea and 
Japan that U.S. commanders have been unable to shift troops from other regions, 
forcing the White House to call up the reserves instead. 
</P>
<P>
"Why fall back on the guard and reserve forces when you have 2 million men and 
women in uniform?" Capt. Bush asked. "The reason is because of the rigidity of 
these plans." 
</P>
<P>
Joshua Epstein, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution, said that "we 
have a lot of the right stuff" for deployments like the current one, but "we 
just have a lot of extra stuff." 
</P>
<P>
He contended that the United States "could have invested much more heavily in 
close air support, in sea lift and the sort of mundane necessities of 
conventional conflict rather than the very big, very high-technology-ticket 
items such as nuclear-powered aircraft carrier battle groups and follow-on 
attack forces. And of course in the strategic field we have five or six ways of 
penetrating Soviet airspace." 
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf crisis has highlighted other needs, said an aide to Sen. Pete 
Wilson (R-Calif.), who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We need research into preserving our electronic and tank weaponry from 
malfunctioning in the hot sun and blowing sand," he said. "We need better 
air-cooling, better reinforcement of armor around wires in the air-defense 
system so that the sun doesn't melt them." 
</P>
<P>
Considering that former President Jimmy Carter instituted a rapid deployment 
force to protect oil supplies from the Middle East in the aftermath of the 1973 
Arab oil embargo, Pentagon and congressional planners have had several years to 
prepare for the kind of crisis with which they are now confronted. Could more 
have been done? 
</P>
<P>
Aspin defends the thrust of defense budgets of the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is the major threat has been the Soviet Union," he said. "If you 
wanted to do something against Panama or Grenada or Iraq, you used what you've 
got. It's not ideal, but it's pretty adequate." 
</P>
<P>
Aspin said that, up to now, "our equipment was designed and structured to fight 
the Soviet Union. We design American tanks with Soviet tanks in mind, American 
planes with Soviet planes in mind, and tactics with the Soviets in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had known five years ago that the Soviet threat was going to recede, and 
in 1990 that we would be facing Iraq or Panama, we could have designed forces 
differently and they would be better," he said. "But it would have taken an 
enormous amount of foresight." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, advocates of new weapons programs that face immediate cuts or 
cancellation because of the fading Soviet threat are scurrying to propound new 
rationales tailored to meet the kind of "Third World threat" represented by 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the B-2 Stealth bomber, originally intended for deep penetration of 
Soviet airspace in a nuclear war, now is being touted for potential surprise 
attacks against the mass-destruction weapons plants and personal quarters of 
such dictators as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Libyan leader Moammar 
Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Strategic Defense Initiative, the space-based "Star Wars" 
program to intercept long-range Soviet missiles, is being promoted in 
ground-based form as a way to kill the missiles of Third World dictators and 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
Whether these and other weapons can be rescued from the budget knife remains to 
be seen. But Aspin -- and others on Capitol Hill -- are convinced that the 
military needs to learn from its experience in the Persian Gulf this year. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've got now is a kind of transition budget, keeping at least one eye on 
the Soviet Union but speculating about what we may be looking at in the 
future," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Hafez Assad, like Syria itself, has always perplexed the West. Yet of 
all the Arab leaders, none has been more skillful and cunning in executing 
policies that are both predictable and consistent. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since high school, when he led street demonstrations in support of Arab 
nationalism, Assad has been the odd man out in the Arab world, a contradictory 
figure who mastered the manipulation of others and built a reputation as a 
statesman who, though devious, honors his word. Many Middle East watchers 
consider him the cleverest politician in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
What Assad wants for Syria is everything that the Saudis never wanted for Saudi 
Arabia. He wants his country to be the pivotal and preeminent Arab kingpin, a 
position normally reserved for Egypt and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
He wants to be the man without whose cooperation neither peace nor war is 
possible in the region. He wants to be the dark shadow over Israel, the thorn 
in the side of the superpowers. And with infinite patience, ruthless brutality 
and political savvy, Assad has put his blocks into place, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
The man James A. Baker III -- the first secretary of state to visit Syria in 
two years -- will meet Friday in Damascus combines the sharp-edged toughness of 
a military man with the urbanity of a barrister. His conservative business 
suits are correctly tailored and -- with his close-cropped hair, trim mustache 
and ramrod-straight posture -- it is difficult to imagine him in traditional 
Arab dress, bent in prayer, though his fingers constantly work over a set of 
amber prayer beads. 
</P>
<P>
Assad does not drink and has not had a cigarette since he quit, cold turkey, 
his five-pack-a-day habit several years ago. He invokes the name of God often 
but is guided by political expediency more than by any higher power. He speaks 
of his desire to promote democracy but watches over his people with 13 military 
and intelligence agencies. He denounces Israel as the enemy, yet secretly cuts 
deals with Israel, honoring "red lines" across which his troops do not stray. 
</P>
<P>
Tall and personable, Assad is a product of both his impoverished childhood and 
Syria's rich cultural heritage. He was born in 1930 in the agricultural village 
of Qirdaha, near the Mediterranean. His father, a farmer, was an Alawite, a 
Shiite Muslim minority subsect not known for its religious fervor. And as a 
youth Assad was said to be deeply affected by the isolation and deplorable 
conditions of the Alawite community. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was a teen-ager, Arab nationalism and Zionism were growing in 
the Middle East as competing forces. Assad joined the nationalistic and 
socialistic Baath Party while in high school and carried his political activism 
into the military academy, from which he graduated in 1955 as an air 
lieutenant. He took further aviation training in the Soviet Union and later 
established a secret military committee within the Baath Party. The committee 
formed the framework for his bloodless midnight coup in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The predictability of Assad's policies reflects his willingness to do anything 
to promote Syria's influence and Arab prominence on the world stage. When that 
meant needing better relations with Washington, he would help achieve the 
release of a U.S. hostage. When it meant abandoning an old ally, Yasser Arafat, 
he would use Syrian artillery to drive him out of Tripoli, Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
When it meant controlling Lebanon's destiny, he would send troops to support 
the Lebanese Christians -- thus putting Syria and Israel on the same team -- 
then switching sides and using his troops to back the Muslims and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
In a review of Assad's 20-year reign, the human rights organization Middle East 
Watch said in a report released this week: 
</P>
<P>
"From the very outset, this regime has been a gross human rights violator. 
Today, in spite of gestures of liberalization, its practices remain repugnant. 
Having killed at least 10,000 of its citizens during the past two decades, it 
continues to kill through summary executions and violent treatment in prison. 
It tortures on a routine basis and arrests and holds thousands without charge 
or trial." 
</P>
<P>
Although Muslim fundamentalists reject the secular values of Assad's omnipotent 
Baath Party and view Syria's Alawite-dominated rule as heretical, Assad appears 
much less concerned about the threat of religious radicals than are his 
neighbors. While the Saudis, for instance, curtailed liberalization policies 
when fundamentalists protested, Assad went ahead and let Damascus evolve as one 
of the Arab world's most cosmopolitan and, by regional standards, wicked 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Over glasses of Scotch and Lebanese wine, Syrians and foreigners alike while 
away evenings in fine restaurants and greet the morrow in nightclubs featuring 
cabarets and the Arab world's only topless dancers. It is Assad's way of 
telling his Arab neighbors that he doesn't give a hoot what they think: He runs 
things the way he wants. 
</P>
<P>
The only people made speechless by the Syrians' sybaritic penchant for enjoying 
themselves are the Iranian pilgrims who arrive by the planeful to visit a 
Shiite shrine on the outskirts of Damascus. They lower their gaze as they walk 
past theaters showing movies such as Charlton Heston's "The War Lord," and 
vendors hawking lottery tickets and postcards of blond girls in bikinis and 
posters advertising the buxom beauty of a California belly dancer named Tamara. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason Assad moves to his own beat is that the Syrians, unlike some 
Arabs, grew up with an identity and a sense of having had a history. In the 7th 
and 8th centuries, Syria was the capital of the Omayyad Empire that stretched 
from Spain to India. 
</P>
<P>
Damascus then was a seat of learning, the home of poets, philosophers and 
writers, and Syria's cultural and artistic contributions to the world rivaled 
those of Mesopotamia and Egypt. Saladin, the Arabs' 12th-Century hero, used 
Damascus as a base to fight the Crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
To this day many Middle East intellectuals consider Assad's Syria to be the 
conscience of the Arab world -- in a spiritual, not moral, sense. 
</P>
<P>
That a president with such an unenviable human rights record should be the 
conscience of anything is one of the peculiarities of the Arab world. But Assad 
has learned that when his help is needed as a regional counterweight, everyone 
-- including the Americans -- overlooks his track record. All he has to do is 
wait, and visitors eventually come courting.

IRAQ SAID TO USE FRENCH ELECTRONICS GEAR; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: THE CONTRACTOR DENIES IT SUPPLIED EQUIPMENT REPORTEDLY AIMED AT 
JAMMING AMERICAN AWACS.

<P>
A major French defense contractor Wednesday denied reports that it has supplied 
Iraqi military forces with electronic equipment capable of jamming American 
AWACS surveillance aircraft deployed in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The terse denial by the large French electronics group, Thomson-CSF, followed a 
report in the London-based Financial Times that American officials have asked 
the French Defense Ministry for technical details of Thomson equipment that 
allegedly has been used by Iraq to jam communications of the Boeing airborne 
warning and control system aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"Thomson denies that it has supplied Iraqi forces with any equipment able to 
jam AWACS or AWACS-related planes," Thomson said in a statement responding to 
the article. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times article also reported that some of the equipment used to 
jam the AWACS aircraft was part of a $170-million contract signed in February 
between Thomson and the government of Saddam Hussein. According to Pierre 
Marion, former head of French intelligence, the Iraqis planned to use the 
electronics equipment to construct their own AWACS aircraft by mounting it on 
Soviet Ilyushin 76 transport planes. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson, however, said no equipment from the contract has been delivered to 
Iraq and added that the equipment in the contract "was in no way related with 
surveillance or countermeasures." The state-owned Thomson company, France's 
largest high-tech arms producer, said the contract has been embargoed as part 
of the sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement declined to comment on 
the reported U.S. request for information. "These subjects are always 
delicate," the official said, "since they involve both important commercial and 
military considerations." 
</P>
<P>
However, since the gulf crisis began, American and French officials have 
reported general cooperation between the two countries regarding details of 
French high-tech equipment in Iraqi hands, including the R-530 air-to-air 
missiles used by Iraqi pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 20 years, France has been the second-biggest supplier to Iraq's 
military, behind the Soviet Union, accounting for 20% of Iraqi foreign arms 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis were even able to get equipment that was never procured by France's 
own military," said one Western diplomat in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman declined to comment Wednesday night on whether Iraqi 
forces had attempted to jam AWACS operations in the Middle East, saying that 
"we can't go into the operational details of whether jamming is taking place or 
not." 
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman stressed that the AWACS has "some inherent and 
sophisticated jam-resistant capabilities" and said the Air Force felt "very 
confident" that the Saudi Arabian-based aircraft could carry out their mission. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of sophisticated military equipment to Iraq was supposedly reviewed in 
France by the Joint Ministerial Commission for War Materiel, composed of 
several key ministers in the government, including Chevenement. 
</P>
<P>
But French embarrassment about the quantity and sophistication of arms supplied 
to Iraq, which now may be used against French forces in the gulf, has caused 
some French politicians to call for a legislative oversight commission to be 
created to monitor arms sales. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to Chevenement charged that the reports against Thomson were 
part of a campaign by enemies of the defense minister.

Republican J. Fife Symington III heads into a gubernatorial showdown against 
Democrat Terry Goddard with a less-than-ringing endorsement from former Gov. 
Evan Mecham. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll support Fife," said Mecham, who lost his comeback attempt in Tuesday's 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
"As I've said many times, Goddard will be a 100% disaster. Fife will only be an 
80% disaster." 
</P>
<P>
With 99% of the state's precincts reporting, Symington had 161,347 votes, or 
44%, to Mecham's 89,496 votes, or 24%, in the five-way GOP race. Goddard had 
209,454 votes, or 84%, to beat perennial candidate David Moss, with 39,970, or 
16%. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the great battle begins," said Symington, a millionaire developer, of his 
general election contest with Goddard, the former Phoenix mayor who also is 
known as Samuel P. Goddard III. 
</P>
<P>
Mecham was seeking a political comeback 2 1/2 years after his impeachment 
conviction and removal from office. Analysts said his chances were doomed by a 
higher-than-anticipated turnout. Also, the five-way race split the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Rose Mofford, who became governor upon Mecham's ouster, had decided to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
Symington, 45, portrayed as the liberal in the GOP primary, used his victory 
speech to get in his first jabs at Goddard, 43, the son of former Gov. Sam 
Goddard. 
</P>
<P>
Goddard "is a professional politician, a tax-and-spend Dukakis liberal 
Democrat, and I'm a Goldwater conservative, and I'm proud of it," Symington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Symington ran a major campaign in the mid-1980s to promote a retail office 
complex that he was developing over then-Mayor Goddard's objections. His 
great-grandfather, Henry Clay Frick, founded U.S. Steel.

pressuring Japan to share more of the financial burden of deploying U.S. troops 
in the Middle East, where Japan gets the majority of its oil. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, attached to a $283-billion military programs bill, would require 
the removal of 5,000 U.S. troops per year from Japan if the Japanese failed to 
pay all costs of stationing U.S. forces in that nation. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. David E. Bonior (D-Mich.), sponsor of the amendment, protested that "Japan 
gets almost 70% of its oil from the Middle East, yet has offered to pay only $1 
billion for the defense of the Persian Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
The 370-53 vote for the amendment reflected the depth of congressional 
exasperation over the failure not only of Japan, but also of West Germany and 
other U.S. allies, to foot more of the bill for Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes earlier, in fact, the House cast a related vote that was characterized 
as a protest against NATO allies seen as lax on burden-sharing. By 249 to 174, 
the House upheld a prohibition in the defense bill against placing a U.S. air 
wing at an expensive new base in Crotone, Italy -- a move that has been called 
NATO's top priority. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the time for NATO-bashing," Rep. David O'B. Martin (R-N.Y.) argued 
vainly in seeking to strike the provision from the defense measure. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the House brushed aside objections to the Bonior amendment. Rep. 
Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) argued that it would be counterproductive because a 
reduction in the 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan would harm American security 
interests in the Far East far more than Japan's. 
</P>
<P>
Bonior suggested that the proposal was intended primarily as a warning that the 
United States, with severe budget problems and the need to fund pressing 
domestic needs, was going to insist more than ever on burden-sharing in its 
international defense efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wake up call for a new world order," he said, invoking the term used 
by President Bush in his Tuesday night speech to Congress describing the 
changing post-Cold War scene. 
</P>
<P>
The House action on funding for the Mideast operation came as the aircraft 
carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower and guided-missile cruiser Ticonderoga, two of the 
first ships to bolster Operation Desert Shield, steamed into port at Norfolk, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
The Eisenhower and its support ships sailed through the Suez Canal Aug. 8 and 
patrolled the Red Sea until Aug. 24. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney visited the 
carrier during its deployment to review operations. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really the only U.S. forces that were ready at that time to interdict 
a further Iraqi aggression into Saudi Arabia," Rear Adm. Thomas Lynch, 
commander of Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12 and Battle Force 6th Fleet told 
reporters aboard the Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
In other defense-related action, the House rejected a burden-sharing proposal 
designed to pressure South Korea into assuming more responsibility for 
defending itself against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
An amendment by Rep. Robert J. Mrazek (D-N.Y.) would have withdrawn 13,000 of 
the 43,000 U.S. troops in South Korea over the next three years, nearly 
doubling Cheney's plan to pull out 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was defeated, 265 to 157, after Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) 
warned that an increased withdrawal might encourage North Korea to launch an 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"North Korea has done nothing to lessen its threat or change its dictatorial 
policies to warrant us lowering our guard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The House approved a Democrat-sponsored plan aimed at having a bipartisan 
commission decide on closings of military bases, instead of the defense 
secretary as under current law. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats charged that Cheney used partisan politics last January in 
recommending the closure or realignment of 47 bases, 93% of which were in House 
districts represented by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans offered, then withdrew, a proposal that would have made it easier 
for Cheney to proceed with the base closures. Rep. Lynn Martin (R-Ill.) charged 
that Democrats were being hypocritical in proposing huge troop cuts while 
opposing for parochial reasons the shutdown of bases. 
</P>
<P>
The House will continue debating the defense bill today as conservatives, 
pointing to new threats represented by the Persian Gulf crisis, seek to restore 
funding to programs that were cut deeply by the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee chopped $24 billion from President Bush's defense request for 
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. The cut was $6 billion deeper than a bill 
passed by the Senate just after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt will be made today to keep alive production of the B-2 Stealth 
bomber, which the pending House bill would terminate after completion of 15 
previously funded planes. Also, proponents of the Strategic Defense Initiative 
anti-missile program, known as "Star Wars," will try to restore $1.5 billion in 
funding cut by the Armed Services Committee.

TV AND STILL CAMERAS WILL BE ALLOWED IN A FEW FEDERAL COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Television and still cameras, which have gone everywhere from the moon to the 
bottom of the ocean, will finally creep into a few federal courts under a plan 
approved Wednesday by the top judges of the U.S. court system. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next July, six federal trial courts and two appellate courts will get 
permission to allow news cameras to photograph, record and broadcast civil 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
However, cameras will not be allowed during trials or appeals of criminal 
cases. Judges will retain the authority to ban cameras at any time. And the 
Supreme Court will remain off limits to modern technology, including tape 
recorders and still photographs. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday's action by the Judicial Conference of the United States is an 
important, if grudging, step toward allowing cameras into the federal courts, 
where they have been banned for decades. 
</P>
<P>
The sensational publicity surrounding the 1935 Lindbergh kidnaping trial 
convinced many lawyers and judges that photographers disrupted the courts and 
distorted the public's perception of the judicial system. A decade later, the 
federal rules of criminal procedure were amended to ban cameras from criminal 
trials. In 1962, the federal court system excluded cameras from civil 
proceedings also. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, of course, television cameras have turned their eye on all manner 
of public business, including the daily activities of the President and 
Congress. Moreover, 45 states now permit cameras in their courts, for criminal 
as well as civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
"The pervasive view was that this is something that was inevitable," said David 
Sellers, a spokesman for 27-member Judiciary Conference of the United States. 
The senior judges, who represent the regional federal courts, chose to go ahead 
with a cautious three-year experiment "rather than have something forced upon 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the "controlled experiment" approved Wednesday, a committee of judges 
headed by Judge Robert F. Peckham of San Francisco will seek jurists who are 
willing to let news cameras into their courts. Only one news cameraman and one 
still photographer in "suitable business attire" will be allowed into a court, 
the new policy says. In 1994, the Judicial Conference will decide whether to 
change the rules to allow cameras in all courts. 
</P>
<P>
After being rebuffed for years, news media lawyers said they were delighted 
with the change.

SACRAMENTO FILE: BILL SIGNED TO PROTECT CREDIT CARD HOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Merchants will be prohibited from requiring customers to write their credit 
card numbers on the backs of checks for identification purposes under 
legislation signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The new statute, effective Jan. 1, is the result of a bill (AB 2880) sponsored 
by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos). It swept through both the Assembly 
and Senate with little opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants argue that they need the credit card numbers to help protect 
against bounced checks, but credit card companies don't cover bounced checks, 
according to Areias. And the numbers can be illegally used by thieves to run up 
huge bills on cardholders' accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another consumer protection measure (AB 2920), also authored by 
Areias, is awaiting the governor's signature or veto. It would prohibit 
merchants from requiring customers to write their home addresses or telephone 
numbers on the front of credit card slips. 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNOR 
</P>
<P>
Bills Signed 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti: SB 1977 by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) to allow the courts to 
suspend or delay for one year the driver's license of a teen-ager who is 
convicted of defacing property with painted or other graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs: SB 2739 by Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) to 
require state agencies that receive federal "war on drugs" funds to report to 
the Legislature on how they plan to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
Video Games: AB 3280 by Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-El Monte) to prohibit 
video games for use by youths under the age of 18 from containing paid 
advertisements for alcoholic beverages or tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
Police: AB 1720 by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) to require a state 
study of the feasibility of establishing a college scholarship program for 
prospective police officers. A report with recommendations will be made to the 
governor and the Legislature by Jan. 1. 
</P>

<P>
Miscellaneous 
</P>
<P>
Procrastination: The Legislature sent Gov. George Deukmejian more than 1,500 
bills during the hectic final week of the recently concluded session. The 
Assembly and Senate had sent the governor only about 700 bills during the first 
eight months of the year. Under the state Constitution, Deukmejian has 30 days 
to either sign or veto the last-minute barrage of measures. He recently took a 
verbal jab at the lawmakers by saying, "Procrastinating is human nature, but 
it's time for the Legislature to take a good hard look at its practice of 
passing hundreds of bills, many of which are not controversial, at the tail end 
of the session."

<P>
Capital Fact 
</P>
<P>
The Latin words "Senatoris Est Civitatis Libertatem Tueri" inscribed above the 
state Senate chamber rostrum translate into "It is the Duty of the Senators to 
Protect the Liberty of the People."

THE STREETS OF L.A. -- LIFE AND DEATH FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the South Los Angeles street where Claudette Ku lived, mothers took their 
children out for a stroll under the searing morning sun Wednesday, just as they 
do every morning -- just as others were doing several miles east, past the 
house in Lynwood where Jonathon Fabian lives. 
</P>
<P>
Like ducks in a shooting gallery, the children of Los Angeles always come out 
-- to walk with their mothers and play and ride. Some die. Each month, the toll 
of Los Angeles' dead and wounded children rises, pushed ever-upward by gang 
gunfire and parental abuse. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the family of Claudette Ku, a 13-year-old girl fatally shot in a 
gang-related shooting, prepared to select a coffin. At Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center, relatives kept vigil by the bedside of 2-year-old 
Jonathon Fabian, critically shot in the abdomen by three teen-agers as he 
played near his house. In West Los Angeles, a man was in police custody for 
allegedly beating his 3-year-old son to death. And in Municipal Court, a 
divinity student was being arraigned for strangling his 3-month-old child and 
taking the body to his wife's workplace. 
</P>
<P>
But on Vermont Avenue, at 82nd Street, where Claudette Ku lay on the sidewalk 
dying the night before, children were at play again Wednesday morning. Luis 
Garza-Ruano stood in his doorway and watched while mothers came out and 
strolled with their babies -- past wood-shuttered windows, graffiti-smeared 
porches and alleys strewn with mattresses, wine bottles and old boots. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed an unconscious act of defiance, this urge to get the children out 
into the sun -- as if all the horror and grief that welled up in two more 
households had failed to mar one of the simplest pleasures of family life. 
</P>
<P>
A sunburned woman walked by Garza-Ruano, carrying her little girl over her 
shoulder. An older girl scampered behind them, whirling an empty pop bottle and 
chattering to herself. There were children strapped into strollers, children 
carrying infants, children peeking out of doorways and alley gardens and 
cluttered markets. 
</P>
<P>
"Something like this, you wonder why people ever take their children outside 
the house," Garza-Ruano said. "But you have to take them outside, right?" 
</P>
<P>
The night before, a few feet from his living room door, Claudette Ku was shot 
once in the head as she sat in a car at a red light with her boyfriend and 
another companion. On Wednesday morning, Garza-Ruano left his wife, Marta, and 
2-year-old daughter for a moment in the doorway ("You hate to look away, even 
for a second," he said) and walked to the corner where paramedics placed the 
girl's body on a stretcher. The sidewalk had been swept, but a lipstick tube 
dropped by the dead girl was lying near the curb. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear the shots and I look out," Garza-Ruano said. "I look and I see the 
blood. Poor girl." 
</P>
<P>
Garza-Ruano's 7-year-old son, Alexander, heard the shots too. After the crowds 
left and the police and the paramedics took away the victims and the empty car, 
the father tried to explain it all to his son. 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't sleep much last night," the father said. "He ask me, 'Do the 
children die?' I say, 'Yeah.' I tell him when he gets older, he better be 
careful, stay away from the pandillas (gangs)." 
</P>
<P>
Those are the kinds of warnings that Frederick Williams, 13, hears every day 
from his mother and father. On Wednesday, Frederick heard the warnings again, 
12 hours after their neighbor, 2-year-old Jonathon Fabian, was shot while he 
played on a toy in front of his family's house in the 4000 block of Platt 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"He don't go nowhere now," said Frederick's mother, 33, a U.S. Census employee 
who declined to give her name. "If (Frederick) wants to go roller skate or go 
see 'Robocop' at the movies, I drive him. This boy will not join a gang. This 
boy ain't gonna be in the line of fire." 
</P>
<P>
The houses on Platt Avenue are low-slung stucco dwellings. They have small 
squares of lawn, driveways and gnarled oaks -- and a sense of well-scrubbed 
comfort that has long disappeared from the street where Claudette Ku died. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick and his mother happened to be in the emergency room at King Medical 
Center Tuesday night when paramedics brought in their 2-year-old neighbor. 
Frederick, there for treatment of cold sores and a fever, at first failed to 
recognize Jonathon. 
</P>
<P>
"They were rolling him through the hall and he went right past us," Frederick 
said. "His eyes were open, but he didn't say anything. When we got home and the 
neighbors told us what happened, we realized who he was." 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God he's still alive," Frederick's mother said. "I looked at my babies 
this morning and I was thankful they were all healthy and well. All you have to 
do is look into those faces to know how terrible it would be if that boy didn't 
make it." 
</P>
<P>
Hugh and Janet Lee live next door to the Fabians. They are childless, but they, 
too, felt for Jonathon. 
</P>
<P>
The Lees, who work as letter carriers for the U.S. Postal Service, have long 
thought about having a baby. But the morning after their young neighbor was 
shot outside their kitchen window, the Lees wondered if having a child was the 
right thing to do after all. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, how do you bring a child into this world?" Hugh Lee asked. "You can't 
protect the children. You see these people let their kids go off to the park . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
". . . And you wonder," interjected his wife, "if they'll come back alive."

4 DEATHS DECLARED A MURDER-SUICIDE CASE

After a weeklong investigation, police said Wednesday it was a pregnant woman 
who fatally shot her two young children and ex-boyfriend and then turned the 
gun on herself. 
</P>
<P>
"We're classifying this case as a murder-suicide," Capt. Thomas Lazar said of 
one of the city's worst murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Our victims are the two children and the male adult." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say they have not determined a motive. 
</P>
<P>
"We may never know," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
The four bodies were found Sept. 5 when police were called to an apartment by a 
family friend who had arrived to help the mother and her children move to 
another area. Getting no answer to his shouts, the friend peered through a 
broken window and saw only the woman's legs as she lay on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the two-bedroom apartment police found the woman, Hanh Thi Duong, 25, 
and her ex-boyfriend, Oanh Van Le, 30, on the living room floor. An undisclosed 
type of firearm was found between them. In a bedroom, Duong's 7-year-old son, 
Thang Quoc Nguyen, and 4-year-old daughter, Lan Ngoc Nguyen, were found dead, 
each from a single gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, police were hampered because of the unwillingness of the victims' 
relatives and friends to contact police with information. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to run down these people real easily," Lazar said. "We've 
run into some cultural problems. . . . They did not come in and volunteer any 
information to us." 
</P>
<P>
When relatives were finally interviewed, they told police that Duong and Le had 
an "on and off again" relationship and were living together in the apartment 
before Le moved out Aug. 27.

200 LAID OFF AT TROUBLED WHEELCHAIR COMPANY; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE ACTION BY EVEREST &amp; JENNINGS IS THE LATEST CUTBACK BY A LOCAL 
BUSINESS THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A GENERAL SLOWDOWN IN THE COUNTY.

<P>
A Camarillo wheelchair company that once dominated the worldwide market has 
laid off 200 workers -- about a third of its local work force -- in a quick 
attempt to stabilize the financially reeling corporation. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs at Everest &amp; Jennings International Ltd. are the latest in a 
series of cutbacks by area businesses that have contributed to a general 
slowdown in the county's economy, according to economic experts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Everest &amp; Jennings' workers, another 670 workers in the 
county have been laid off in recent months by such firms as Northrop Corp., 
Raytheon Co. and Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst I've seen it since 1969," said Ralph Chumacher, president of 
the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. "I think it reflects the mood of 
the whole economy in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
James Esmay, dean of the business school at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand 
Oaks, said he expects layoffs among various businesses in the county to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any question that the economy has slowed down," Esmay 
said. "Whether we are in a recession, we still won't know for a couple of 
quarters." 
</P>
<P>
The Everest &amp; Jennings employees, were notified Tuesday and Wednesday that 
they were being laid off. Company officials said they hope that the layoffs are 
only temporary, but would not speculate when any workers might be rehired. 
</P>
<P>
"Our company has been going through a difficult period," said a company 
official who asked not to be identified. "The fact is, there was a need to 
reduce our costs very quickly and very decisively. These are the hard actions 
you have to make to protect the remaining positions." 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has already cut about 350 workers worldwide since December, 
is not anticipating more cuts, officials said. The employees laid off this week 
range from salaried managers to assembly workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be meeting with the remaining people to make sure they understand the 
situation," the official said. "What we're trying to do is steady the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
The company -- which made wheelchairs for Franklin D. Roosevelt and Sir Winston 
Churchill -- has been struggling to recover from a disastrous attempt to 
diversify into other medical products during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the company lost $42.1 million on sales of $183.9 million due mainly 
to restructuring costs, inventory writedowns and costs of starting new 
products. 
</P>
<P>
In two letters written last week to Everest &amp; Jennings, Equity Pacific 
Ltd., a major shareholder in the company, said payments on $14 million in loans 
it made to the wheelchair manufacturer are overdue. 
</P>
<P>
Top officials at Equity Pacific refused to comment on the matter. But a source 
at Equity Pacific said the quick layoff decision could have been prompted by 
the complaints about overdue loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
"Something had to be done to bring spending in line with revenues," the source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the laid-off workers at Everest &amp; Jennings were told that 
Wednesday was their last day of work, some will be kept on for another month, 
depending on the nature of their jobs, the Everest &amp; Jennings official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We still hope to recall the workers as quickly as we can, but it's uncertain," 
he said.

PARKS COMMISSION WANTS PIER RESTORED 
</P>

<P>
The Ventura parks commission recommended Wednesday that the City Council accept 
$3 million in grants and borrow $500,000 to restore the Ventura Pier and build 
shops at its base. 
</P>
<P>
Since pilings were destroyed in a 1986 storm, at least 1,000 feet of the 
longest pier in California have been closed. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's recommendation will go to the City Council on Sept. 24 and, if 
approved, the funds would be used to lengthen the 118-year-old pier to its 
original 1,958 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to lease 15,000 square feet at the base of the pier to 
restaurants and retail stores to offset about $150,000 in yearly maintenance 
costs, said John Baker, Ventura city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"The concessions will generate a revenue fund so that the restoration will pay 
for itself," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
A grant of $500,000 from a state special account has already been secured for 
the project. The remaining $3 million will come from four sources pending 
transfer of ownership to the city of Ventura from the state and assurances that 
concessions will be built, said Mary Lou Schill, commission administrative 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
The funds would include $1 million from state bonds approved by voters in 1980, 
$500,000 from a loan by the California Coastal Conservancy to be paid back in 
the first five years, $1 million from a California Coastal Conservancy grant 
and a $500,000 grant from the Wildlife Conservation Board. LAURA PITTER

TEACHER SUIT ALLEGES BIAS IN JOB TRANSFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oxnard elementary school teacher filed a race-bias suit Tuesday against the 
Oxnard School district, alleging that she was transferred because she is 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Cecelia Bishara, a Chilean-born, 11-year veteran of the Oxnard school system, 
filed the suit in Ventura County Superior Court, saying that the unwanted 
transfer spurred her to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Patterson, the district's assistant superintendent for personnel, said 
Tuesday that Bishara was transferred to a bilingual first-grade class in a 
different school because the district eliminated the bilingual kindergarten 
class she was teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Bishara's suit charges that the district passed over equally qualified 
non-Latino female teachers and chose her to be reassigned when it had to fill a 
vacancy at the Kamala Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson confirmed that Sierra Linda Elementary School Principal Edmundo 
Chavez transferred Bishara out of her bilingual kindergarten class and assigned 
her to a bilingual first-grade class at Kamala School on April 26, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says that Bishara's doctor advised her to go on a medical leave of 
absence Sept. 9, 1988, because of her anxiety over the transfer. And the suit 
charges that the district refused Bishara's repeated attempts to reverse the 
transfer, making its final refusal on Jan. 19, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Bishara quit her job the next day because of "risk to her emotional well-being" 
and her belief that the transfer was equal to being fired, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks the court to order the district to pay Bishara lost salary and 
wages, psychiatric and medical expenses and unspecified punitive damages. MACK

SCHOOL BOARD MAKES CHOICE FOR TOP POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard Union High School District's five-month search for a new 
superintendent ended Wednesday night when the board named the head of a small 
Stanislaus County high school district to its top job. 
</P>
<P>
Ian C. Kirkpatrick, 48, accepted the $87,000-a-year post left vacant with the 
July 1 departure of Bob Cash. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick, who assumes the post full time on Oct. 8, had been superintendent 
of the Oakdale Joint Union High School District for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to become an important cog in the wheel," Kirkpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard district, with six high schools and 11,000 students, has a student 
body nearly four times larger and far more ethnically diverse than Oakdale, 
whose three high schools enrolled 2,400 students this year. Minority students 
compose 65% of Oxnard's student population, compared with 35% in Oakdale. 
</P>
<P>
"Migrant, bilingual and bicultural education is something we'll be working on 
as often as possible," said Kirkpatrick, a former social studies teacher and 
track coach. 
</P>
<P>
District trustees launched their search for a new superintendent in March when 
Carter announced that he would be stepping down. He left the post he held for 
10 years to take a job as superintendent of the Santa Clara Unified School 
District in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees paid $12,000 to an assistant director of the California School Board 
Assn. to help find a successor. The search yielded nine finalists from a field 
of 50 applicants that included an associate dean of USC's School of Education 
and superintendents of the Glendale Unified and Berkeley Unified School 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees interviewed all finalists before settling on Kirkatrick. Before 
offering him the job last week, trustees visited with educators and board 
members in his 440-square-mile district in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"The words we kept hearing were 'hard-working, integrity, ethical and 
conservative,' " Trustee Jean B. Daily said. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

4 BRIDGES PICKED FOR QUAKE FORTIFICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Department of Transportation has identified four bridges in the 
unincorporated area of the county that should be strengthened to better 
withstand earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ventura County officials will decide whether improvements will be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
The bridges are located at the Ventura River at Casitas Vista Road northwest of 
Ventura, Calleguas Creek at Hueneme Road near Point Mugu, Coyote Creek at Santa 
Ana Road in the Ojai Valley and the Santa Clara River at South Mountain Road 
northeast of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The total cost for the bridge improvements was estimated at $978,000 -- the 
most expensive being the Santa Clara River bridge at $575,000. The work would 
involve installing cables to prevent the bridge from falling off the abutments 
during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
New legislation in the wake of the Oct. 17, 1989, earthquake near San Francisco 
calls for the identification of bridges statewide that need renovation. Ventura 
County was among four governmental agencies selected for a pilot program to 
implement the improvements before they are done statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature appropriated funds for the statewide improvements, but the 
money is far less than what is required, according to a county public works 
agency report given to the Board of the Supervisors on Tuesday. The work may 
require a 30% match of local funds, according to a report by Al F. Knuth, 
deputy director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
Knuth said Caltrans is letting local officials decide whether to proceed with 
the work. His office will evaluate the risk for the four bridges first and 
evaluate cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Gordon, principal engineer with the transportation department, said all the 
bridges except the one over Calleguas Creek have low traffic volumes. The four 
were picked, he said, because of their age and their proximity to areas 
vulnerable to earthquake damage. JANE HULSE

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: REDEVELOPMENT SUIT GETS COURT APPROVAL

<P>
The Moorpark Unified School District was given the go-ahead by the state Court 
of Appeal on Monday to continue its lawsuit challenging the city's 1989 
redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
A lower court had ruled in January that the district waited too long to join 
lawsuits filed by Ventura County, the Mosquito Abatement District and the 
Ventura County Community College District over the city's redevelopment plans. 
</P>
<P>
According to district officials, the redevelopment plan would deprive the 
district of $120 million in taxes over 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
The city's redevelopment plan includes more than 1,200 acres of the downtown 
area in addition to the Virginia Colony, a small community on the eastern side 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Tax revenue gained through redevelopment will be used to pay for sidewalk, 
storm drain and street repairs. The city will also be able to lend residents 
money to rehabilitate houses. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

Adrian Bertolotti, 40, was arrested on suspicion of cultivation and possession 
for sale and is being held in lieu of $100,000 bail. His mother, Anna, 58, and 
his wife Page, 28, were held on suspicion of the same charge but were later 
released on their own recognizance. 
</P>

WOMAN, 72, ESCAPES $175,000 HOUSE FIRE

<P>
A Meiners Oaks woman barely escaped a fire Wednesday that destroyed her home, 
damaged a neighbor's house and ignited a small grass fire a block away. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said a faulty heating unit in the garage caused the fire, which 
may have smoldered for several days before it erupted, causing $100,000 damage 
to the house and $75,000 to the contents, including a late-model car. 
</P>
<P>
Jennie Taylor, 72, who lived at 819 Cambon Circle, escaped when she heard an 
explosion in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
Six engine companies with 35 firefighters from as far as Rincon, Camarillo and 
Las Posas responded to the blaze, but the roof was caving in when they arrived, 
making it hazardous for them to enter, department spokesman Norm Plott said. 
The firefighters arrived on the scene at 11:13 a.m. and had the fire 
extinguished at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Two firefighters were treated for heat exhaustion, another for minor burns and 
a fourth, Fred Mandragon, 55, captain of the Oak View fire station, was taken 
to Ojai Valley Community Hospital with chest pains, Plott said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a part-time Ventura College employee, said she had just returned from 
her morning swim, parked her car in the garage and entered the house when she 
heard an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big, muffled boom," said Holly Mitchem, Taylor's neighbor, whose 
house had $2,000 in damage. THIA BELL

19TH-CENTURY SAILING SHIP REPLICA TO BE OPEN FOR TOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A full-scale replica of a 19th-Century sailing ship, complete with wooden 
masts, will dock at the Channel Islands Harbor on Saturday as part of the 
harbor's 25th anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Ventura County Maritime Museum, the $450,000 ship Pilgrim will 
be docked behind the Whale's Tail Restaurant and will be available for public 
tours until next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the festivities, the ship will be the site of the theatrical version 
of Richard Henry Dana's epic "Two Years Before the Mast." The one-act, one-man 
show, which will run Saturday and Sunday, depicts Dana's experiences as a 
sailor aboard the Pilgrim in 1835. 
</P>
<P>
Guided tours of the ship and the smaller ship Witch of Wood will be offered 
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday through Thursday. The cost is $3, $1.50 for 
children 12 and under. 
</P>
<P>
The original Pilgrim was built in Medford, Mass., in 1825 at a cost of $50,000 
and was lost 21 years later in a fire at sea. The Pilgrim's home dock is Dana 
Point Harbor, where it acts as a classroom for the Orange County Maritime 
Institute.

BASEBALL: BILL WHITE, WHO THREATENED TO RESIGN, GETS THE BACKING HE SOUGHT ON 
INCIDENT INVOLVING UMPIRE JOE WEST.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill White, National League president, gained the support he wanted from owners 
here Wednesday concerning an incident with umpire Joe West. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill has the full support on his stance in this matter," said Bill Giles, 
Phillies' president. "Bill seemed satisfied everybody was behind him. I hope he 
gained some power in the West case." 
</P>
<P>
White met with West after the veteran umpire threw Philadelphia pitcher Dennis 
Cook to the ground during a Phillies-Dodgers brawl Aug. 22 and ejected Phillie 
Von Hayes for making a remark to a first base coach about another umpire. 
</P>
<P>
West said White supported his actions. But White quickly issued a contradictory 
statement, saying he had barred the umpire from making further physical contact 
with players. 
</P>
<P>
Richie Phillips, executive director of the Major League Umpires Assn., then 
asked Commissioner Fay Vincent to intervene. After a daylong meeting last week, 
Vincent said the matter was resolved and that umpires' cases would continue to 
be handled by league presidents. 
</P>
<P>
But White wanted a stronger show of support from Vincent and reportedly 
considered quitting. 
</P>
<P>
Owners termed the 90-minute National League meeting as "peaceful," despite 
reports that White remains unhappy. However, a showdown may be approaching on 
another subject -- American League owners' desire to share in the NL's 
$190-million expansion fee windfall. 
</P>
<P>
Giles said NL owners remain opposed to sharing the $190 million they will split 
when two franchises are chosen by next September. The teams won't begin play 
until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
AL owners did not split their expansion fees when Toronto and Seattle joined in 
1977 and, Giles said: "We don't think they should get any. . . . It should be 
done as in the past. There's never been a split before." 
</P>
<P>
AL President Bobby Brown said the league sent NL owners data on the financial 
impact of adding two franchises "to see what they think about it." The AL 
hasn't formally asked to share. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, club owners will decide today whether to approve Robert Nederlander 
as general partner of the New York Yankees. Nederlander met with the ownership 
committee for several hours Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Committee cahirman Jerry Reinsdorf said the committee will make a 
recommendation to the joint meeting of AL and NL owners, but declined to reveal 
it. No owners have voiced opposition to the theater producer's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Nederlander must be approved by three-fourths of AL owners and a majority of NL 
owners to replace George Steinbrenner, who was forced to resign Aug. 20 after 
Vincent's investigation into his dealings with self-described gambler Howard 
Spira. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last month's 7 1/2-hour rain delay for a Texas Ranger-Chicago White Sox 
game was discussed in the AL meeting, but Brown said, "We decided to leave that 
alone and hope it never happens again." 
</P>
<P>
 -- AL teams will be discouraged from supplying champagne or other alcohol for 
postgame celebrations by championship teams. Brown said private parties would 
be permitted outside of camera range. 
</P>
<P>
 -- AL owners were briefed on the new Comiskey Park, which will open next 
season, plus new stadiums in Cleveland, Baltimore and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robert J. Kheel was hired as NL counsel, replacing Louis L. Hoynes, who 
will become senior vice president and general counsel for American Home 
Products Corp.

So it was Geiger who won the golden opportunity to succeed Lew Perkins, who 
came to Maryland after serving at Wichita State. The automatic question is why 
would anyone want to leave Stanford, richly endowed and with enormous prestige, 
for the discontent and ongoing problems at Maryland? 
</P>
<P>
In conversations with an assistant who once worked for Geiger and a Stanford 
alumnus who knew him from almost the day he arrived, the picture they paint is 
of an individual who knows how to project, has outstanding intellect, can sell 
an idea (also himself), has a good sense of humor, is the ultimate politician, 
enthusiastic, can get things accomplished, is creative and perceptive ... 
except in handling people. 
</P>
<P>
One negative aspect to his 10-year performance is that at Stanford, and 
previously at Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania, he had 
difficulty keeping a staff -- either the people left or were fired. Also, he 
has difficulty understanding how a football program should be conducted, he has 
a tendency to avoid problems, is not a good businessman, has difficulty saying 
"no," can be overbearing, likes to second-guess, depleted the fiscal reserves 
at Stanford and seemed more interested in getting a booster to make a donation 
rather than soliciting the help he or she might otherwise be able to offer. 
</P>
<P>
His mental capacities are enormous and can't be underrated, even though a 
bachelor's degree from Syracuse is the extent of his formal education. He is 
receptive to appointing minorities to positions of authority, has an "Ivy 
League aura," usually says all the right things, exudes some of the same 
characteristics found in network television executives and is a doer. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Geiger could possibly bring an end to the Maryland slump. But 
maybe not. Some of the same Maryland administrators, including President 
William Kirwan, were in accord with the former chancellor, John Slaughter, when 
he demonstrated how little he knew about sports. Slaughter, after the damage 
was done, took a hike, going off to be president of Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland's search committee, making a recommendation to Kirwan, was no doubt 
overwhelmed by the mere anticipation it could attract an athletic director from 
Stanford. Maybe there was a more gifted man or woman at Long Beach State, 
Kentucky, Alcorn State or Alderson-Broaddus. But being able to draw from 
Stanford is what Maryland wanted in playing its own game of climbing the 
academic-athletic-social ladder. The only thing better would have been Harvard 
or Yale. 
</P>
<P>
Geiger doesn't have much to beat since he's following Perkins, who never 
clicked with the populace, even though he had some important Maryland graduates 
endeavoring to help him. There are enormous problems at Maryland, coaches and 
assistant administrators trying to cover their own territories in a fight for 
survival, plus recruiting difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
So Geiger is in an enviable position. Anything he does, major or minor, will be 
applauded and, in time, the conditions can only be improved because they have 
to get better, even by osmosis. Take a bow, Andy. It's an almost can't-miss 
opportunity, plus a salary in excess of $120,000 and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Geiger, no doubt, had a longer relationship at Stanford than early reaction to 
his administration would have suggested. A 1983 column by Glenn Dickey in the 
San Francisco Chronicle offered this conclusion: 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question Geiger has an outstanding mind. Those who have worked 
with him on innovative ideas in cable-TV programming, for instance, praise his 
creativity and say he grasps ideas quickly. In my own dealings with Geiger, I 
found he has a way of cutting through to the essentials of complicated deals. 
</P>
<P>
"Some day, perhaps soon, those qualities will get him a job for which he is 
better-suited, a job in which he works primarily with ideas, not people. And 
when he leaves, the sigh of relief within the Stanford athletic department will 
be heard in downtown San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Now the reign of Geiger is about to begin. Not wanting to demean him but having 
the link to Stanford was his most important professional credential. It got him 
the job.

CSUN RALLIES TO TIE WASHINGTON IN TWO OVERTIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In regulation play and double overtime, Washington's soccer team appeared to 
have Cal State Northridge beaten Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Linhart and Danny Daniels, Matador forwards who recently had been 
sidelined because of injuries, scored to help CSUN tie the 19th-ranked Huskies, 
3-3, before 542 at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
With his back to the net and 3 minutes 21 seconds remaining in the second 
overtime, Daniels took a pass from Armando Valdivia, turned, and shot blindly 
from 25 yards out to tie the score for the final time. Regular-season games do 
not proceed beyond two overtimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew where I was and I didn't have time to look or to think," said Daniels 
of his first career goal. 
</P>
<P>
After missing the first 3 1/2 matches of the season with a hyperextended 
Achilles' tendon, Daniels entered the match against Washington just before 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking I got to get on the field and do something good," Daniels said. 
"Those two weeks out were the longest I've ever been hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore from the island of Cyprus also figured in the CSUN goal that tied 
the score, 2-2, with 2:11 left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Just as he was attempting to shoot from close range, Daniels was tackled by 
Husky defender James Dunn and the Matadors were awarded a penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
Linhart, a junior from Thousand Oaks High, scored with a boot to the right 
corner. Washington keeper Rolf Norton got a hand on it when he dived, but 
barely slowed the ball on its way into the net. 
</P>
<P>
It was Linhart's second goal of the game in only his first start. He had been 
used as a reserve because his knee was weak following surgery June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get into top form until two weeks ago," said Linhart, who played for 
CSUN as a freshman in 1987 but missed the '88 season as a redshirt and last 
season to concentrate on his studies. 
</P>
<P>
Washington (3-0-1) scored 12 minutes into overtime on a goal by Shannon Murray. 
Daniels appeared to clear the rebound off Chad Crithfield's corner kick, but it 
deflected off a CSUN player and landed near Murray. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN trailed, 1-0, at halftime but tied the score less than four minutes into 
the second half. Bobby Reyes' corner kick started the play. The perfectly 
targeted crossing pass soared over a bottleneck of players in front of the net 
and was headed by Gus Cardenas. He laid the ball at the feet of Linhart, who 
booted it into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Matador midfielder Terry Davila suffered a concussion. He already had 21 
stitches in his forehead following a collision last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN captain Ed Burns limped off the field with a left knee injury in the first 
half.

CARTER LIKELY TO CARRY LOAD FOR KENNEDY; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: GOLDEN COUGARS FAVORED ALONG WITH SAN FERNANDO, WHICH WILL REVERT TO 
ITS WISHBONE ATTACK.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kennedy High Coach Bob Francola figures he rode his bicycle at least 1,500 
miles this summer. Big mileage for the big guy, who has shed 100 pounds since 
last fall and weighs in at 204. 
</P>
<P>
The former Hollywood High standout says he has lost so much weight that "people 
believe me now when I tell them I used to be a fullback and not a lineman." 
</P>
<P>
Francola's tailback, Ontiwaun Carter, rushed for 1,563 yards last fall. Big 
yardage from a big-play guy. Carter, however, gained five pounds in the 
off-season and it has not slowed him at all. 
</P>
<P>
"(People) remarked last year how much bigger and faster he seemed," Francola 
said. "Believe it or not, 'Twan's bigger and faster now." 
</P>
<P>
Carter, a 5-foot-10, 175-pound senior, is expected to carry the bulk of the 
Kennedy offensive load. And take it from anybody who tried to bring down Carter 
from behind last year and failed, nobody confused him with an offensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
The return of Carter, who led area City players in rushing last fall, is the 
primary reason North Valley League coaches point toward the Golden Cougars as a 
co-favorite with San Fernando. Simply put, Carter is Kennedy's marquee player, 
a player capable of lighting up a scoreboard -- or shooting the lights out. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, in fact, the Kennedy field went black in the middle of one of his 
scoring jaunts, a power outage having cut off electricity in the stadium. In 
the blink of an eye -- Francola says Carter has run 40 yards in 4.41 seconds -- 
Carter was standing alone in a darkened end zone. Which, come to think of it, 
happened often enough when the lights were on. 
</P>
<P>
Running primarily out of a single-back set, Carter averaged 6.2 yards a carry 
and scored 10 rushing touchdowns. No loss of power is expected in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"He's due for a great season," Francola said. "He's got to get his hands on the 
ball 30 times a game by either the run or pass." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the key for Kennedy might be its passing game, since stopping Carter often 
meant stopping the team in its tracks. The Golden Cougars' offensive line 
features four juniors and a senior, although junior guards Troy Bregel and 
Craig Gardner started every game last season. 
</P>
<P>
Effective pass blocking will be a must with 6-5 senior Mike McMullen, a pocket 
passer, starting at quarterback. Carter, who caught four passes last season, 
will be utilized more often as a receiver, Francola said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be as close to balanced as possible," Francola said, referring to 
run-pass equity. Last season, Kennedy passed for 1,138 yards and rushed for 
1,651. With Carter accounting for 94.7% of the team rushing total, better 
balance in the backfield sounds like a good idea too. 
</P>
<P>
Senior receiver Keith West, Kennedy's lone two-way starter, caught 29 passes 
last season to lead returning area City Section players. West will start for 
the third year at safety and also will handle the punting and kicking. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, San Fernando is undergoing a metamorphosis. Three seasons ago, the 
wishbone set was jettisoned so the Tigers could better utilize the multiple 
talents of All-City quarterback Joe Mauldin. Next came Michael Wynn, who passed 
for 24 touchdowns and earned All-City honors as a junior in 1988. Yet last 
season, with Wynn back for his senior year, the offense fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers had problems finding receivers and the offensive line was a sieve. 
So just in time for the new decade -- and the beginning of San Fernando's 
fourth quarter-century of football -- it's Back to the 'Bone. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a lot quicker this year," Hernandez said. "Last year we were kind of 
stocky and slow." 
</P>
<P>
The backfield of 1990 is stocked and fast. Kennedy gets things done with 
Carter; San Fernando by committee. 
</P>
<P>
Brothers Tony and Leonice Brown, uncles of former Crespi All-American Russell 
White, will split time with LaKarlos Townsend, Will Taylor and Amon Flanagan in 
the Tiger backfield. 
</P>
<P>
If three of the five merely repeat their efforts of a season ago, the Tigers 
will gain roughly 2,000 yards on the ground. Leonice Brown rushed for 1,097 
yards at Crespi last year as a junior before transferring. Townsend, a junior, 
gained 464 yards, and Taylor, a senior, rushed for 260. 
</P>
<P>
It won't hurt the transition to have former Tiger running back Chris Richards, 
who started for two seasons at Cal, serving as an assistant coach. But unless 
San Fernando's line play improves, rolling up yardage with the wishbone might 
prove to be nothing more than wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Their success always seems to depend on how good they are up front," Francola 
said. "When Fernando's good it's because they have good linemen. They always 
have the skill kids." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando has two returning all-league linemen in Steve Diaz (5-10, 210) and 
Rene Acosta (6-1, 250). Quarterback Cruz Trevino is not particularly fleet of 
foot, but nobody is questioning his judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"Speed-wise, he's about average," Hernandez said. "But he runs the team real 
well and he knows which guys he needs to give it to." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's senior quarterback Dave Erhardt, a transfer from Canoga Park, has 
the arm and mobility to give defenses fits. Erhardt passed for 889 yards and 
seven touchdowns and scored four times on the ground. Cleveland was moved from 
the West Valley League to the North Valley this season. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll have to be reckoned with," Francola said. "Cleveland's in a good 
position. Everybody's looking at Fernando and us and if we're not careful, 
we're both going to end up chasing Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
Reseda, promoted to the North Valley from the 3-A Mid-Valley League, might take 
its lumps. The Regents could use as many as eight two-way players and are 
fielding one of their smallest teams in several years. To worsen matters, Andre 
Jackson, the returning starter at quarterback, moved to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Yet if Reseda's characteristically solid defense can keep the team close, the 
Regents have the capability to win in the fourth quarter. Sophomore kicker 
Gerald Cohl made 22 of 23 point-after tries and six of 10 field-goal attempts 
while playing for the B team last year. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda allowed an average of 202.6 yards a game, second only to Granada Hills 
among area City teams. Otherwise, it would seem to be a good league in which to 
be a ballcarrier. Among the 17 City schools in the Valley last season, 
Cleveland was eighth in total defense (219.0 average), San Fernando (226.7) was 
10th and Kennedy (278.2) was 16th.

FORKEL FINDING HIS GROOVE AS A PROFESSIONAL BOWLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like most aspiring actors, Eric Forkel hopes to land a starring role on one of 
America's most popular TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
But he is not an actor; he is a professional bowler. 
</P>
<P>
And although he has come close, Forkel has never made the Saturday matinee. 
Bowling observers say, however, that Forkel's moment is nearly at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric seems to be getting better all the time," said Mike Durbin, a three-time 
winner of the Firestone Tournament of Champions who is a bowling commentator 
for ESPN. "He has really solid fundamentals, not a lot of flair out there, but 
he gets the job done. He has steadily improved as he has bowled on the 
(Professional Bowlers Assn. national) tour." 
</P>
<P>
Forkel, a left-handed bowler, did get into the limelight last month when he won 
the PBA Showboat Western Region Open in Las Vegas. Even though it is not a stop 
on the national tour, the tournament draws more bowlers than any regional on 
the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big breakthrough for me," said Forkel, who lives in Granada Hills. 
"I bowled for the title and I won with a strong finish. This is a culmination 
of what I've been working on for sometime." 
</P>
<P>
Still the win -- he beat Mark Baker of Huntington Beach, 237-185, in the final 
-- did not come in a national event. Winning one of the PBA's 33 national 
competitions is Forkel's ultimate goal. A victory at one of the national events 
would qualify him for the tour's top stop, the Firestone tournament in Akron, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Forkel, who will turn 30 this month, has been on the fringe of national success 
since 1988, when he was named Southern California bowler of the year by the 
Bowling Writers of Southern California based on his performances in PBA 
regional events and on the independent Professional Coast Bowlers Tour, which 
also stages regional events. He has earned $21,000 this year and about $100,000 
in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Yet nothing has come easily. Forkel constantly battled to maintain a steady 
income, sometimes from work on the side. In his personal life, Forkel had to 
overcome the death of his father and the breakup of his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Getting to the edge of the national pro bowlers circuit was challenge enough, 
but getting beyond that might be the most difficult part of all. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition is so tough at (the national) level," Forkel said. "You are 
going against the best bowlers in the country. You have to try a little harder 
at this level." 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California bowler-of-the-year award seemed an obvious springboard 
for Forkel. Ostensibly, it would bring Forkel offers from sponsors and 
televised appearances at national events on programs like "Pro Bowlers Tour" on 
ABC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Forkel is still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
A friend has provided him with additional cash to travel to certain PBA 
national events, but Forkel has competed in only 26 national events over the 
past two years. The top bowlers on the national circuit usually compete in that 
many events in one year. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, before Forkel's name becomes commonplace in TV Guide, he feels he 
must get a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
In bowling, sponsors differ from those in auto racing and golf in that they 
generally do not get their names mentioned or shown on television. A sponsor 
will make a payment covering some of the bowler's expenses, then take a 
percentage of the bowler's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his failure to gain financial backing, Forkel has been able to maintain 
his consistency on the lanes. He has continued his winning ways and has 
progressed into the late stages of some of the top national tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Forkel advanced to the semifinals of three PBA national 
tournaments. He placed 16th in the Fair Lanes Phoenix Classic and in the 
Columbia Open in Austin, Tex., but his best showing came in the Miller Lite 
Challenge in Tucson, Ariz. Forkel finished sixth there, just missing the finals 
of the tournament and a chance to compete in the nationally televised portion 
of the event. 
</P>
<P>
He is close enough to the big time that he just needs a push to get himself 
over the edge, but Forkel watchers feel that boost must come from within. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to believe he can win," Durbin said. "It is now a matter of him 
believing he can compete with the elite. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I am trying to (instill) in him a mental attack," said Len Mal, 
Forkel's coach, who also has coached PBA Hall of Famers Dave Davis, Johnny 
Petraglia and Dave Soutar. "I have worked on building him a better professional 
attitude, reminding him that every ball means something and that he must have a 
winning attitude. The only difference between Eric and guys making $200,000 is 
mental." 
</P>
<P>
A six-figure income must have seemed as remote as a 900 series when Forkel 
became a member of the PBA in 1982. Working as a clerk at an Encino 
supermarket, he was more concerned with trying to make a living than stardom as 
a pro bowler. 
</P>
<P>
He had attended Valley College for six months but realized that college was not 
what what he wanted. Bowling, which he had taken up only five years earlier, 
would be the ideal way to make a living for Forkel. Unfortunately, it didn't 
start that way. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two years, I struggled just to break even," Forkel said. "I would 
say I was losing (money) at first." 
</P>
<P>
While Forkel had to work at the supermarket for financial support, he gained 
spiritual support from his father Wally. When the two were not arguing about 
the younger Forkel's bowling style or his lack of confidence, Eric found in his 
father constant reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started, I was told by a lot of people that I wouldn't make it in 
this sport," Eric said. "I would receive a lot of negatives, but my father was 
a positive. We would fight a lot, but he was always trying to help me." 
</P>
<P>
When Wally died of cancer in 1985, the already insecure Eric needed a new form 
of encouragement. Eric found some solace in victories, winning a few scratch 
tournaments that year and showing signs of improvement. But his father's death 
slowed Eric's rise in the bowling ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just starting to get in a positive frame of mind, he was due to start 
bowling better," Mal said. "The death of his father really hurt him. His father 
was his best friend." 
</P>
<P>
Forkel's career appeared to be like a bowling ball traveling down the lane, 
barely clinging to the edge while avoiding a fall into the gutter. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, he appears to be breaking back into the middle of the lane. 
Has he begun his break too late, or will Forkel find the sweet spot and begin 
to win on the national tour? 
</P>

BRISON'S ODYSSEY TAKES HIM TO LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Brison, the former San Fernando High athlete who was suspended from 
athletics for one year by the City Section, has enrolled as a junior at 
Eldorado High in Las Vegas, his fifth high school. 
</P>
<P>
Brison, 16, had lived with his mother in Pacoima until he moved this summer to 
Las Vegas, where his father resides. He joined the football team the day after 
Eldorado started summer football practice Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Eldorado opened its season last week with a 27-0 victory over Clark of Las 
Vegas, but Brison missed the game because of a broken thumb. He injured his 
right thumb in practice and will miss at least one more game. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the injury, Brison has impressed Eldorado Coach Gary Mitchell. The 
5-foot-9, 191-pound Brison will play running back and defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the better ballplayers I've seen in a while," Mitchell said 
Wednesday. "He has the ability to help us in a lot of different positions. We 
look for a lot of big things from him." 
</P>
<P>
Brison was suspended from San Fernando in May after he was arrested and charged 
with punching Birmingham High track Coach Scott King. He completed the spring 
semester at Jane Addams continuation school in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Brison was arrested April 30 after his father James accompanied him and a 
contingent of San Fernando track athletes to Birmingham. Because San Fernando 
had failed to request permission to use the track, King asked the athletes to 
leave, prompting an argument between King and James Brison. The younger Brison 
then punched King, according to a police report. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police referred his case to juvenile authorities, who placed him on 
six months' probation. In June, the City Section's Interscholastic Athletics 
Committee banned him from athletics for one year, retroactive to April 30. 
</P>
<P>
The committee had considered a permanent ban but chose the less-severe 
punishment because members were impressed with Brison's contrition and his 
character. 
</P>
<P>
City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness learned of Brison's transfer this week 
and will not contest his eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"First, there is no jurisdiction for us to do that, but even if there was, I'm 
not going to make an issue of it," he said. "I have no ax to grind with the 
boy. I want the young man to get on with his life." 
</P>
<P>
Brison transferred because of the City Section ban and said he is content at 
his new school. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't play in California, so I came here," he said. "This is a nice 
school with a nice atmosphere. I'm happy being here." 
</P>
<P>
He started his high school career at Westlake, moved to Alemany halfway through 
his freshman year and then moved to San Fernando midway through his sophomore 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Brison had 238 yards rushing and 208 receiving last year at Alemany. He was one 
of the area's top sprinters last spring, posting times of 10.8 seconds in the 
100 meters and 22.2 in the 200 for San Fernando.

NEWS BITES : CAN THIS MERINGUE BE SAVED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a remarkable act of public-spiritedness, the Sheraton Grand Torrey Pines 
Hotel in La Jolla provides a hotline for questions about food, from home as 
well as professional cooks, on any subject at all: nutrition, ingredients, menu 
planning, even recipes via fax. Executive Chef Jim Coleman or one of his main 
staff members handle the questions. The number is (617) 450-4527 (there's no 
charge but the phone company's), and the best time to call is from 4 to 7 p.m. 
Monday through Friday, though they do take calls at other times. 
</P>

<P>
But He Still Gets Carded 
</P>
<P>
The Pillsbury Doughboy is 25 years old this year, and he's had a full, rich, 
lite 'n' flaky life so far. 
</P>
<P>
In the past quarter century he has popped out of 5,760 cans of dough, appeared 
on 25.4 billion packages, inspired a giant ectoplasmic manifestation in "Ghost 
Busters" and has been belly-poked on TV no fewer than 32,000 times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pickled Pups 
</P>
<P>
A food chemist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory in Philadelphia 
has created a pickled hot dog that doesn't have to be refrigerated. The problem 
was keeping the dogs from turning to mush in the pickling solution; James B. 
Fox's solution was adding the thickening agent xanthan gum -- more or less 
giving the hot dogs a collagen injection. 
</P>
<P>
Fox describes the flavor as tasting like a dill pickle with a pickled meat 
flavor. "If you happen to like pickled flavors, you'll like this," he says. "I 
have carried them on backpacking trips." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
There's a Grub in Your Future 
</P>
<P>
What's in an insect? Take away its wings, legs, body armor and disgusting 
antennae and stuff and it's basically the same sort of rich, tender 
invertebrate flesh as those bugs of the sea, the crustaceans. Or eat it when 
it's still a grub; throughout the tropical world grubs are considered 
delicacies, and with the growing interest in things Australian we will soon get 
the chance to try the native Aussie delicacy known as Witchetty Grubs. 
</P>
<P>
That name will be a marketing problem, though. 
</P>
<P>
Let's call them . . . Land Shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's Only a Naive Domestic Tap Water But You'll Be Amused by Its Surface 
Tension 
</P>
<P>
Last week the American Institute of Wine and Food held a tasting of tap water 
from 12 California communities, collected in accordance with professional water 
tasters' guidelines (which exist). The best-tasting water, according to seven 
food and wine experts, came from Huntington Beach, which gets its water from 
local wells. Huntington Beach water had only 299 milligrams of dissolved solids 
(minerals) per liter; 11th-place Santa Barbara tap water had 800 mg/l. 
</P>
<P>
How do water tasters cleanse their palates between waters? Eating crackers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Department of Practical-Sounding Inventions 
</P>
<P>
We all know the biggest lie in the world is, "To open, tear on dotted line." A 
couple of years ago this was brought home to a fellow named Gregg Converse when 
he saw his girlfriend using her expensively capped teeth to open a cereal box 
just so she wouldn't break a nail trying to tear on a dotted line. He invented 
a solid plastic tool called the Boxtopper to do the job. If you can't find them 
in stores, they're available for $2 postpaid from Boxtoppers, P.O. Box 2349, 
Bath, Ohio 44210. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call Him Mr. Tea 
</P>
<P>
Making tea is about as hard as boiling water and then sitting down; imagine how 
hard it must be to sell people on buying tea in canned form. T. Hasegawa Co. of 
Japan is taking on the challenge, though, with its new development, canned 
carbonated tea. The flavor is said to be "clearer and more defined" than that 
of the usual canned tea. Plus you can shake up the can and squirt your friends 
with it.

THE GALLO WARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secrecy has always surrounded the E. and J. Gallo Winery operations. But a few 
intimate Gallo family details have been revealed via court records over the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest and Julio Gallo sued their younger brother, Joseph Gallo Jr., when he 
tried to market his own line of cheese with the Gallo name. "I have only got 
one name," Joseph Gallo told the press at the time. "I don't know how I'm 
supposed to look for another one." 
</P>
<P>
It was a messy legal battle. The older Gallos contended that Joseph Gallo's 
cheese wasn't a quality product. Joseph Gallo ended up countersuing his 
brothers claiming they had cheated him out of a portion of his inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, the younger Gallo contended that Joseph Gallo Sr. had founded the 
Gallo Winery, making Joseph Jr. entitled to a third of the profits. But the 
court, agreeing with Ernest and Julio Gallo, decided that the winery was 
founded by the elder brothers with their own funds. The funds came from the 
estate of the Gallos' parents, Joseph and Susie, who died in an apparent 
murder-suicide on June 21, 1933, before the end of Prohibition later that year. 
In February of this year, Joseph Gallo filed a federal appeal, renewing his 
claim to a one-third interest in Gallo. DAN BERGER

WINE NOTES: BERINGER TO RENAME NAPA RIDGE BRAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The name of Beringer Vineyards' successful "Pop-Premium" brand, Napa Ridge, may 
soon be changed to Coastal Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Moone, president of Beringer, said the Coastal Ridge name will be 
test-marketed in Colorado, Arizona and Georgia in early 1991, and if the test 
is favorably received, the brand will be changed nationwide. Moreover, the name 
of the wine already has begun transition in that direction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first tests with the name in focus groups was very positive," said Moone, 
"so we're already phasing it in." Bottles of the current releases of Napa Ridge 
wines now have the name as "Coastal Napa Ridge," with the word "Coastal" in 
script type. If the test proves successful, the word Napa will be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Moone said the Coastal Ridge name "tested with consumers better than Napa Ridge 
-- they thought it was more indicative of a high-quality wine." 
</P>
<P>
The Napa Ridge brand recently has created some headaches for Wine World, 
Beringer's parent company, though at the beginning, he said, the name was 
logical. "When we started out with Napa Ridge, we were using Napa wines. It was 
a time when there was a surplus of Napa wines, and we were a Napa product," 
said Moone. "But as the brand grew and the supply of Napa wine shrunk, we began 
to use more and more grapes from other coastal regions, and we became a 
non-Napa wine." 
</P>
<P>
He said the wine in the bottle soon wasn't a product of the Napa Valley, so he 
felt the name inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, federal law says wines that carry in their brand names the name of a 
regional appellation (in this case it was Napa) cannot blend grapes from other 
regions as flexibly as if a broad appellation such as California were used. 
This meant that making Napa Ridge wines was logistically more difficult. Also, 
the rules made it more difficult to make consistently styled wines. 
</P>
<P>
Changing to an appellation that doesn't hamstring the wine maker will permit 
more blending and thus make for more consistent wines, Moone said. Moone said 
the testing would run through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Napa Ridge line is the nation's sixth largest Pop-Premium brand after 
Sutter Home, Glen Ellen, Gallo, Sebastiani, Mondavi and Fetzer. Under the Napa 
Ridge name, Beringer produces about 750,000 cases of Chardonnay, Cabernet 
Sauvignon, Chenin Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc, Gewurztraminer, Zinfandel and 
non-varietal red and white table wine. 
</P>
<P>
Moone said the Napa Ridge brand is growing rapidly, but he said Wine World's 
other low-priced brand, Los Hermanos, is down to 200,000 cases as the winery 
phases it out. 
</P>
<P>
The Robert Mondavi brand is the top-listed brand in Newport Beach restaurants, 
but Kendall-Jackson is fast moving up to challenge, according to Scorecard, a 
monthly publication that analyzes trends in Southern California's retail and 
restaurant wine sales. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey of 58 restaurants, Scorecard found 152 brands of Chardonnay, with 
Kendall-Jackson the leader, listed by 41 of the 58 restaurants. Chateau St. 
Jean had 36 placements and Robert Mondavi 31. Raymond had 28 followed by Far 
Niente (25) and Callaway (24). Mondavi was the out-front leader in Cabernet 
listings, with 46 to Beaulieu's 32 and 22 for Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Cumulatively for the two most popular varieties, Mondavi had 77 placements with 
Kendall-Jackson at 48. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Mondavi brands (including Vichon and Opus One) accounted for 12% of 
the American wine listings of Chardonnay and Cabernet, the publication said. 
Moreover, Mondavi Fume Blanc led in Sauvignon Blanc listings with 32 and also 
was the leader in Pinot Noir placements. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Eberle, owner and wine maker of Eberle Winery in Paso Robles, and Joe 
Carrari, a grape grower in Los Alamos Valley, have been presented with awards 
from the Central Coast Winegrowers Assn. Eberle was named Wine Maker of the 
Year and Carrari Wine Grower of the Year. Birtice Card of Hampton Farms, who 
helped establish the Central Coast wine-growing region and the Los Padres 
Grower Foundation, was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
A group of wine makers and grape growers on California's Central Coast is 
supporting a proposal for an appellation to be called Santa Barbara Coast, an 
area encompassing most of Santa Barbara County as well as a portion of southern 
San Luis Obispo County. 
</P>
<P>
At an informal meeting held at Brander Winery in Santa Ynez Valley, about a 
dozen of 18 wineries attending the late-August meeting said they favored the 
appellation, which comprises about 8,000 acres of vineyard land, including 
6,000 in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
Two San Joaquin Valley men have been indicted for conspiring to obtain higher 
prices for cheaper grape varieties by misrepresenting them as expensive 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments stem from a grape-pricing scandal following the 1988 harvest in 
California, according to federal government charges. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said that brothers Frank and Nick 
Bavaro were charged with misrepresenting 6,500 tons of wine grapes, 
representing more than 1 million gallons of wine valued at more than $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Following the 1988 harvest, various investigative agencies including BATF and 
the state Alcohol Beverage Control Department uncovered more than a dozen cases 
where cheaper grapes were misrepresented as more expensive varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers for Common Sense, the coalition of alcoholic beverage industry trade 
groups that opposes Proposition 134 (which would raise taxes on alcoholic 
beverages), says it has mailed out more than 18,000 copies of the tax proposal 
to callers responding to radio and television ads. 
</P>
<P>
The material being sent out is a kit containing a highlighted version of the 
proposition with comments about its various sections as well as copies of 
articles that have appeared referring to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Bill McIntyre, a spokesman for the Irvine-based group, said the anti-Prop. 134 
campaign began with statewide radio ads June 18. A series of television ads 
began July 23. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought after the first couple of weeks the calls would slow down, but they 
actually increased," said McIntyre. Seventeen different radio commercials have 
been used.

Prop. 134, the so-called "nickel-a-drink" proposal, would raise the tax on wine 
from 1 cent per gallon to $1.29 per gallon. Proponents say funds raised -- $700 
million in the first year -- would be used for a variety of health and social 
programs to combat alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre said the proposition would require "spending $2 billion, so all 
Californians, whether they drink or not, would have to pay for this." He added 
that the measure provides "nothing for public school education and only 3% to 
drunk driving enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
The ads say that reading the proposition explains its ramifications. Copies of 
the proposition may be obtained by calling (800) 464-READ. 
</P>
<P>
Major funding for Taxpayers for Common Sense comes from the Beer Institute, 
Wine Institute and the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). 
The group was founded earlier this year to fight Prop. 134.

HOW MUCH GALLO IS THERE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is estimated that Gallo's sales in 1989 were 71 million 9-liter cases of 
wine. "But that's only a best guess," says one industry consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Major wine industry watchers are never certain their numbers on Gallo are 
correct. Gallo employees are forbidden to say anything about the company, which 
means even getting accurate case sales and dollar volume figures is a guessing 
game. As for dollar volume, an industry analyst said Gallo revenues for the 
year were probably about $850 million. 
</P>
<P>
That figure comprises about $100 million from the sales of Gallo varietal 
wines, $120 million from the sale of 2.3 million cases of brandy, and the 
remainder from the sale of jug wines such as Boone's, Thunderbird and wines 
sold in huge boxes for restaurant by-the-glass programs. Included in the 
restaurant sales are wines sold under the names Carlo Rossi and William 
Wycliffe. 
</P>
<P>
Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco investment house with holdings in the 
wine industry, said in a recent report on the wine industry that in 1989, Gallo 
vaulted from third to No. 1 in the sale of varietal wines by U.S. wineries, 
with 4.3 million cases sold. No. 2 was listed as Sutter Home with 3.4 million 
9-liter cases. 
</P>
<P>
Gallo represents about 30% of all U.S. wine produced, and it gets most of that 
volume by buying grapes on the open market, though the company also owns 5,000 
acres of grapes other than its Sonoma ranches. Most of that vineyard land is 
located in Livingston, along the Merced River in Merced County. DAN BERGER

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: ELBOW ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Around 3 o' clock at Musso &amp; Frank, with the counter mostly emptied of its 
flannel-cake stragglers, a busboy smooths out white linen napkins for the 
dinner crowd. An ashtray smell of cold, burnt wood comes off the grill behind 
the counter's middle, and a man pokes among the dead ashes for a while before 
walking over. 
</P>
<P>
"If you hear a little explosion," he says, "don't worry. I'm turning on the 
grill. If you hear a big explosion . . . run like heck." 
</P>
<P>
Within a couple of minutes, he coaxes the grill into crackling life. The warm 
scent of woodsmoke spreads across the room. A red-jacketed waiter comes over 
and pours a clear, cold martini, Hollywood's best, from a pony into a tiny, 
frosted glass, then carefully spoons Welsh rarebit from a metal salver onto 
crustless toast. Other waiters bustle about the empty restaurant, preparing for 
the evening rush. 
</P>
<P>
It seems very much a perfect gentleman's lunch, here in these worn, wooden 
swivel chairs beneath the ancient hunt-scene wallpaper. The rarebit is rich, 
warm, a little grainy, not a platonic Fannie Farmer vision of the classic 
cheese dish but very good anyway, especially when cut through with the chill, 
bitter snap of the gin, and topped with salty bacon you crumble yourself. The 
service is solicitous, but mostly leaves you to your own thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Musso's, the oldest real restaurant in Los Angeles, is an easy place to be 
happy, and it seems a privilege to be able to come here every once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, it's impossible to describe Musso &amp; Frank as a restaurant, 
rather than one's own relationship to Musso &amp; Frank. Like the Griffith Park 
Observatory or Ramon Navarro's star on Hollywood Boulevard, Musso's just is, 
canned asparagus and crab Louie and all. Faulkner and Fitzgerald and M.F.K. 
Fisher drank here, and practically everybody has opinions of the place, none of 
which are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
You might dislike the flannel cakes -- thin, plate-size pancakes that taste 
something like rubbery fortune cookies -- but almost everybody else adores 
them. You might subscribe to the conventional wisdom about the place (you'll do 
all right if you stick to steaks, chops and martinis), but thousands of others 
can recite the unchanging list of daily specials by heart. 
</P>
<P>
Curious about jellied consomme? Quivery brown stuff, sort of refreshing with a 
squeeze of lemon, mounded in a tiny, iced bowl. Combination Louie? Cooked, 
chilled shrimp, crab and lobster piled on a bed of lettuce, with little paper 
cups of horseradish-catsup sauce and spicy thousand island dressing on the 
side. Finnan haddie? A huge, naked haunch of smoked haddock, intimidating but 
sort of delicious really, served with good tartar sauce and boiled new 
potatoes. The sheer size of the menu, which doesn't seem to have changed much 
since the restaurant opened in 1919, makes it possible to eat as Jay Gatsby may 
have, or Nora Charles, or Mr. and Mrs. Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
At the counter, all sorts of possibilities arise that probably wouldn't occur 
to you in a booth. You can split a club steak or a Wednesday order of 
sauerbraten with a friend without feeling cheap. You can strike up a 
conversation with the person sitting next to you, who might be a B-movie 
character actor, or the woman who arranges the music for "Twin Peaks," or a 
seedy Brit who's just had his car stolen and wants to borrow 20 bucks just till 
next week. (You watch close, to make sure he doesn't stick you with the check.) 
</P>
<P>
"What's in a chicken pot pie?" asks a man at the end of the counter. "Chicken, 
for crying out loud," his friend says in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
If you've sat at the end closest to the door, you can watch a waiter croon Hank 
Williams songs or make silk hankerchiefs disappear. The waiter, Manny, also 
makes the best Caesar in the joint, garlicky and awash with pungent anchovies. 
(If you're with a pretty girl who looks longingly enough at him when he's 
tossing one, he might slip you a few leaves free of charge.) You can order 
coffee and a bread pudding, and peoplewatch for hours during the pre-theater 
rush. You can eavesdrop. 
</P>
<P>
"Taylor's is where you go for a steak," said the woman sitting next to me one 
evening. She reached over and stabbed a forkful of Caesar salad from my plate. 
"Musso's is where you come for, well, a bowl of peas." She ordered a hot turkey 
sandwich for herself and a hot chicken sandwich for her friend, and under the 
gobbets of brown gravy, one sandwich not only looked, but also tasted exactly 
like the other, mounds of bland comfort food on crustless white toast. I let 
her have a big piece of my steak. 
</P>
<P>
 Musso &amp; Frank Grill, 6667 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, (213) 467-7788. Open 
Monday-Saturday, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Full bar. Validated parking in rear.

TREATS FOR MEXICAN INDEPENDENCE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican Independence Day this weekend will no doubt inspire a round of 
celebrations. Since parties usually mean chips and dips, this is the time to 
try out a crunchy, full-flavored chip that is authentically Mexican but not 
commonly known: duritos. 
</P>
<P>
Think of duritos as a cross between Indonesian shrimp chips, pasta and 
chicharrones. Raw, they look like strips of hard, ridged, translucent pasta. 
When deep-fried, they puff up like shrimp chips. And they look a little like 
chicharrones -- crisp-fried pork cracklings that also make good snacks. The 
difference is, duritos are made from flour and not from meat. 
</P>
<P>
The raw chips are manufactured in Mexico and exported to Los Angeles. They're 
available here in a variety of markets, among them the Tianguis chain, the 
Grand Central Public Market in downtown Los Angeles and Market Basket in 
Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
Or you can buy bags of fried duritos processed by Del Mar Foods Co. of 
Oceanside and packaged under its Don Victor label. Del Mar produces duritos 
flavored with chili powder and lemon in two sizes -- small dippers and 
large-sized chips. The large chips are also available without seasoning, and 
the little dippers come in two additional flavors: shrimp and jalapeno. 
Tianguis carries the Don Victor chips. 
</P>
<P>
Olvera Street is a good source for another type of treat -- candy. The 
selection of typical Mexican dulces (sweets) displayed in stalls there includes 
biznaga, which is cactus candy. Biznaga is often cut fine and added to the 
filling for chiles en nogada -- fresh poblano chiles stuffed with meat, fruit 
and nuts and topped with walnut sauce and pomegranate seeds. It's a dish linked 
to pomegranate season, which is getting underway now. 
</P>
<P>
Look also for candied sweet potato (camote) and squash (calabaza). Coconut 
turns up in alfajores (blocks of white coconut candy tinted shocking pink on 
one side) and cocadas, baked confections that vendors define as macaroons. 
</P>
<P>
Pepitoria, the Mexican version of pralines, contains either peanuts or pecans. 
And there are individually wrapped circles of mazapan (marzipan) made of 
peanuts ground as fine as dust. 
</P>
<P>
Milk and sugar cooked together is the base for a number of candies including 
jamoncillo (bars of plain milk fudge); rosquilla (ridged bars of 
coconut-flavored milk fudge); marina (balls of milk fudge coated with chopped 
pecans); gorditas de leche (milk fudge patties) and leche quemada (burnt milk 
fudge). 
</P>
<P>
And there's still more -- balls of sweet-sour tamarind-flavored candy, rolls of 
guava paste, melcocha (taffy) and large cookies, either plain or coated with 
multicolored candy sprinkles (grajea). Look for the candies at the stands that 
line the center of the street. 
</P>
<P>
In some Olvera Street shops, you'll find equipment for cooking and serving 
Mexican meals. The Casa de Sousa's stock of pottery includes stunning, large 
talavera-style bowls in deep blue and cream from Guadalajara and a hand-painted 
brown dinner set from Michoacan. Blue-rimmed, handblown glassware and 
ornamental tin service plates would create a striking table. On the practical 
side, there are molcajetes (rough stone mortars), tortilla presses and iron 
comales (griddles) on which to bake the tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
The Casa California offers pottery bean pots and enormous cazuelas that could 
function as serving containers for a large gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Here you will find the highly effective aluminum lime squeezers that are 
manufactured in Mexico. A larger size in the same design is used for oranges. 
Other kitchenware includes wooden spoons, rolling pins and molinillos, the 
wooden beaters that are used to froth hot chocolate. The shop also carries 
yarn-embroidered baskets for tortillas and has at least one of the large, 
unlined copper cazuelas in which Mexican cooks prepare sweets and other dishes.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: DO WE HAVE A NATURAL HUNGER FOR NUTRIENTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Woody Allen's movie "Sleeper," set far in the future, he explains to a 
surprised traveler from the past that hot-fudge sundaes and steaks have been 
found to be good for you. We'd all like to live that fantasy: having foods that 
look, smell and taste good turn out to be the most nutritious. Even better 
would be if the reverse were true: if finding a food distasteful signaled that 
it was not nutritious, or even plain bad for us. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, that implies an inborn ability to select a good diet and avoid a poor one 
-- equipment we lack. It's true that we do have some general genetic 
information handed down from remote ancestors, as well as more recent 
scientific and cultural guidelines. Otherwise, we're on our own in dealing with 
a huge, varied food supply perhaps as challenging as that faced by the 
hunter-gatherers of long ago. The human race has been so successful as a 
species partly because we are omnivores, able to adapt to new sources of 
nourishment -- provided we experiment with caution. 
</P>
<P>
By this time in our evolution, the ways we choose foods are complex. Dr. Paul 
Rozin, professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, recently 
published an update in Nutrition Reviews on how long-lasting food preferences 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few genetically programmed biases for or against certain food 
substances. Thousands of years ago, two bits of enduring information were 
acquired by our nomadic progenitors: Sweetness provides energy and bitterness 
can signal harm. 
</P>
<P>
Today, when drops of salty, sour, bitter or sweet solutions are placed on the 
tongues of newborn babies, their expressions range from emphatic rejection of 
the bitter solution to beaming acceptance of the sweet one. The age-old lesson 
is still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Humans also instinctively display ambivalence about new foods -- suspicion 
coupled with curiosity. Historically, man has had an inborn ability to make the 
link between a given food and unpleasant consequences. This information was 
handed down through the generations, promoting survival of the species. 
</P>
<P>
There are innate hungers for a few essential nutrients. Earlier in this 
century, Dr. Curt Richter conducted classic studies with rats (another 
successful omnivorous species). Sodium-deficient for the first time, the rats 
selected high-sodium foods. Made thirsty, they chose foods high in water. It's 
also possible, but unproven, that there are innate hungers for protein, 
carbohydrate and calcium. 
</P>
<P>
Be that as it may, over time humans (and rats) learn to identify foods that are 
deficient in specific nutrients and foods that supply the lack. Long before a 
deficiency of Vitamin C was pinpointed as a cause of scurvy, British ships were 
carrying preventive medicine in the form of limes (citrus fruits are high in 
Vitamin C) on long voyages. Centuries before, the diet of Chinese sailors 
included the fresh, Vitamin C-rich leaves of ginger plants. 
</P>
<P>
Predominantly, however, our food choices are influenced by culture and 
ethnicity, and by individual experiences, pleasant and unpleasant. Sometimes 
cultural knowledge is a plus. The ancient Mexican practice of soaking corn 
kernels in lime water to soften them for tortillas also releases niacin in the 
corn for absorption by the body and helps prevent pellagra in corn-eating 
populations. Fermenting milk to produce yogurt makes it possible for 
lactose-intolerant people to enjoy its nutritional benefits, among them 
protein, riboflavin and calcium. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you belong to the people of northern Japan, who 
habitually eat a high-salt diet, you have a better chance of developing 
hypertension than inhabitants of the southern Japanese islands, where salt 
consumption is low. An innate recognition of the need for enough sodium is not 
paralleled by an inner gauge signaling when you've had too much. Similarly, the 
universal inborn preference for sweet flavors doesn't extend to an instinctive 
knowledge that sugary foods, particularly sticky ones, are harmful to teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Within cultures, there are many variations in individual food preferences. 
Strangely enough, though, family relationships have little impact on individual 
choices. Heredity plays a role in obesity, but bows out when it comes to food 
selection. Even a mother's or father's likes and dislikes have no great 
influence on those of their children. 
</P>
<P>
Why the family has so little imprint on individual choices is a mystery. 
Another public-health puzzle is why people like or dislike foods because of 
their intrinsic sensory properties. Obviously, it's easier to persuade people 
to eat healthy foods if they also taste good. Worldwide, the food industry is 
devoting some $2.5 billion annually to finding ways to give flavor to low-salt 
products, add sweetness to foods low in sugar, or introduce a rich and creamy 
"fat" sensation without using fat. 
</P>
<P>
Both as nutritionists and as food lovers, our taste is for fresh and lightly 
processed foods. But with all this research going on, maybe Allen's 
hot-fudge-sundae future isn't so far away after all. 
</P>
<P>
Question: While listening to a TV talk show that took viewers' calls, I heard a 
mother call in and ask if it was safe to let her two daughters, age 10 and 12, 
become vegetarians. The answer given was that it was fine, especially if the 
diet contained dairy products and eggs. However, the person on the show was a 
health reporter, not a nutritionist. Was the advice sound? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Indeed it was, as far as it went. A lacto-ovo vegetarian diet can 
provide enough of the essential nutrients young people need for growth and 
development. Contrary to popular belief, however, the nutrient that deserves 
special attention is not protein. Almost certainly, it will be present in 
sufficient amounts -- not only from dairy products and eggs but from the 
vegetables and grains the youngsters eat to get the calories they need. 
</P>
<P>
Iron is a different story. In vegetarian diets, the amount of iron is more 
limited. Iron from vegetable sources also is absorbed less efficiently than 
iron from animal flesh. For these reasons, it's important to pay particular 
attention both to getting enough iron into the diet and to making sure that 
it's well absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
Iron-rich foods include enriched and fortified breads and cereals, dark-green 
leafy vegetables and dried beans. The key to enhancing absorption from these 
foods is Vitamin C. That's found in generous amounts in many fruits and 
vegetables, among them citrus fruits, tomatoes, cantaloupe, honeydew, broccoli, 
green pepper and cabbage. Serving a C-source along with an iron source makes 
good nutritional sense. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I bought a tube of concentrated tomato paste in an Italian grocery. The 
packaging had no instructions about how much to use in place of regular tomato 
paste in a can, and nobody in the store could tell me. Do you know? 
</P>
<P>
A: Whether it comes in a tube or a can, we're talking about the same product. 
Either way, that means about 15 calories per tablespoon, virtually all from 
carbohydrate. Use the same amount as you would if the paste came in a can. The 
advantage of the tube is when a recipe only calls for a tablespoon or two. Of 
course, it can be more expensive to buy it in this form. You could open a can 
of paste when you need a small amount and divide the rest into small portions 
to store in the freezer until needed. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, tubes of tomato paste and other seasoning are only beginning 
to become popular. In Europe, this form of packaging has been in use for a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are there any differences in the Vitamin-C content of frozen orange juice 
prepared from concentrate versus the juice available in the dairy case? 
</P>
<P>
A: The differences are insignificant. In six ounces of juice, the average 
amount of Vitamin C ranges from 74 to 76 milligrams, considerably more than the 
Recommended Daily Allowance of 60 mg. It's true that Vitamin-C losses occur as 
the juice sits in the refrigerator. To minimize losses, keep the juice tightly 
covered. Refrigerate it promptly after use, and buy amounts that you can use up 
within a few days.

BACK TO BASICS: CARAMEL CANDY: SWEET AND EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homemade caramels have a flavor distinctively their own -- buttery, creamy, 
with undertones of butterscotch. Ideally they should be delicately chewy with a 
smooth, grainless texture. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve these characteristics, cook the ingredients slowly, allowing the 
sugars and milk solids to caramelize. The longer and slower the mixture is 
cooked, the darker the color and the stronger the flavor of the finished candy. 
</P>
<P>
Before beginning the cooking process, line an 8-inch baking pan with foil and 
butter lightly, or lightly butter an area approximately the same size on a 
marble slab and arrange metal candy bars that have been lightly buttered on the 
inside over top, forming an 8-inch square. 
</P>
<P>
Combine the corn syrup, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, whipping cream and 
butter in a heavy 4-quart saucepan. Place over medium heat and stir constantly 
with a wooden spoon until all the sugar crystals dissolve, then wash down the 
sides of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in hot water (Step 1). 
</P>
<P>
A candy thermometer must be used when making caramels. Place it in the pan and 
move as necessary when stirring the mixture (Step 2). The thermometer may be 
clipped to the side of the pan, but needs to be moved frequently to prevent the 
candy under it from scorching. 
</P>
<P>
Continue cooking the mixture, washing down the sides of the pan at least two 
more times, for 30 to 40 minutes. Stir constantly during the last of the 
cooking period to prevent scorching. 
</P>
<P>
When the mixture registers 238 degrees on the thermometer, begin testing for 
the desired consistency by dropping a small amount of the mixture into ice 
water (Step 3). Test the cooled ball of candy between your thumb and fingers 
(Step 4). The consistency will be the same as the finished batch. 
</P>
<P>
Pour the mixture into the prepared pan (Step 5) or inside the candy bars. Do 
not scrape the caramel that remains in the cooking pan, as it is tougher and 
will leave hard spots in the poured-out batch. Instead, scrape the remainder 
onto a plate (Step 6) and serve separately. 
</P>
<P>
The caramel should stand at room temperature overnight so that it cools evenly 
and becomes firm. 
</P>
<P>
Remove the caramel from the pan and peel off the foil (Step 7) or remove the 
metal candy bars. Butter the blade of a chef's knife and cut the candy into 
squares with a sawing or rocking motion (Step 8). 
</P>
<P>
Wrap the caramel individually and store at room temperature for several days or 
in the refrigerator up to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
CARAMELS 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups light corn syrup 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk 
</P>
<P>
2 cups whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup butter, cut into thin slices 
</P>
<P>
Line 8-inch baking pan with foil. Lightly butter foil and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Place corn syrup, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, whipping cream and butter in 
4-quart heavy saucepan. Place over medium heat. 
</P>
<P>
Stir mixture constantly with wooden spoon until all sugar crystals are 
dissolved. Wash down sides of pan with pastry brush dipped in hot water. 
</P>
<P>
Stir frequently, moving thermometer as necessary, until mixture reaches 238 
degrees. Wash down sides of pan at least twice more during cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Begin testing for desired consistency by dropping small amount of mixture into 
ice water. When candy reaches 245 degrees or desired consistency, remove from 
heat. Cooking process will take about 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Pour into 8-inch foil lined pan or onto lightly buttered marble slab with 
buttered metal candy bars arranged to form 8-inch square. Do not scrape pan. 
</P>
<P>
Allow to firm overnight. Lift caramels from pan, peel off foil or remove metal 
candy bars. Butter blade of chefs knife and cut into 3/4- to 1-inch squares, 
using sawing motion.

A VEGETARIAN MEAL SPICED WITH TASTES OF INDIA; 
</P>
<P>
ETHNIC CUISINE: A MENU OF SOUTH INDIAN DISHES FAVORS STEAMED AND LIGHTLY 
SAUTEED DISHES UTILIZING TRADITIONAL FLAVORINGS.

<P>
Following a strict vegetarian diet is a challenge when traveling. At times, 
South Indian violinist L. Subramaniam has made do with fruit and nuts; other 
times he's gotten by with cheese pizza or meatless Chinese dishes. But at home 
in Reseda, he can eat just as he did growing up in his native Madras -- thanks 
to his wife, Viji. 
</P>
<P>
Subramaniam may be internationally known for his work in Indian classical, 
Western classical and neo-fusion music -- a blend of jazz and classical Indian 
and Western elements -- but it's his wife who orchestrates traditional Indian 
meals for the family. (She's also a musician -- when Subramaniam performs at 
Wadsworth Theater tonight as part of the Los Angeles Festival, Viji will 
perform alongside her husband. She plays the tambura, a stringed instrument 
from which a constant tone sounds out as a reference point for the musicians, 
and she keeps time with hand gestures.) 
</P>
<P>
South Indian food is "very balanced," says Viji, who was born in Madras and 
raised in Bombay. Steamed and lightly sauteed foods are favored over fried 
food. And safflower and corn oils are beginning to replace coconut and sesame 
oils as cooking mediums. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally she branches out into other cuisines -- Mexican, Chinese and 
Italian, for instance. Eggplant Parmigiana is one of her husband's favorite 
dishes. And she makes enchiladas filled with cheese, olives and mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The Subramaniam household is traditionally Indian in many respects. Figures and 
paintings of Hindu gods are displayed in the living room. Shoes are removed at 
the entrance. And an auspicious symbol decorates the door step. In India, this 
symbol, called kolam, would be freshly painted each day. But this kolam is a 
permanent sticker, a modern approach to the old custom. 
</P>
<P>
Music pervades the family. Even 2-year-old Raju knows how to hold a miniature 
violin. The influences come from both sides of the family. Subramaniam has made 
approximately 50 recordings; he scored the film "Salaam Bombay," served as 
musical adviser for the Peter Brooks stage production of the Indian epic 
"Mahabharata," and has taught South Indian music at California Institute of the 
Arts in Valencia. Viji is the daughter of noted North Indian singer Lakshmi 
Shankar and Rajendra Shankar, an elder brother of sitarist Ravi Shankar. She 
also sings and holds a master's degree in music from Cal Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The Subramaniams met in 1974 in London while taking part in "Festival From 
India," a program presented by George Harrison that featured Ravi Shankar. They 
were married in Bombay in a ceremony that lasted three days and involved 
serving elaborate meals to 500 guests. 
</P>
<P>
For her family meals, Viji finds almost everything she needs at local Indian 
markets, but she brings certain products home from India. For instance, 
pappadams (lentil wafers) are thinner in Madras than those available here. She 
also brings South Indian rice seasoning mixes. 
</P>
<P>
The following recipes were selected from a dinner Viji prepared recently for 
her family, including daughters Niru, 10, and Seeta, 6, and her father-in-law, 
V. Lakshmirarayana, and a few friends. The menu: masala alu, spicy potatoes 
prepared according to a recipe from the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh; a 
spinach, lentil and coconut concoction called spinach kootu; a Punjabi lotus 
root curry; sambar, a tamarind-flavored lentil and vegetable soup spooned over 
rice; pachadi, the South Indian version of the yogurt relish called raita, and 
tamarind chutney spiced with home-grown chiles. 
</P>
<P>
Along with basmati rice, Viji Subramaniam offered crisp fried pappadams. The 
dessert was payasam, a typical southern Indian sweet of vermicelli cooked with 
milk, sugar, raisins and cashews and flavored with crushed cardamom. All of 
this was served in individual thalis -- metal trays containing small metal 
bowls to hold the food. 
</P>
<P>
Special ingredients needed for these dishes include canned lotus root from 
India; amchur, a tart seasoning made by grinding dried mangoes; the Indian 
spice blend called garam masala; powdered asafoetida, and, for the dessert, an 
extra-fine grade of Indian vermicelli. These can all be found at Indian markets 
in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 L. Subramaniam performs tonight as part of the Los Angeles Festival. The 
concert begins at 8 p.m. at Wadsworth Theater on the Veterans Administration 
Grounds.

MARGARINE VS. BUTTER; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: SCIENTISTS ARE CONCERNED OVER INTAKE OF TRANS FATTY ACIDS, THE TYPE 
FOUND IN MARGARINE. BUT THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Butter lovers may have felt vindicated recently when a study in the New England 
Journal of Medicine reported that a type of fat found in margarine may increase 
the risk of heart disease. But some medical experts are cautioning that while 
the study was well designed, the results do not give a green light either to 
eating only butter or forsaking margarine. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a provocative new finding, but before it's applied to the public, it 
needs to be repeated and confirmed. People shouldn't go overboard with a single 
study," said Alan Chait, professor of medicine at the University of Washington 
and chairman of the nutrition committee of the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't get too excited about this," said Kenneth Fisher, director of the 
life-sciences research office of the Federation of American Societies for 
Experimental Biology. Fisher said Americans should still focus on reducing the 
total amount of fat they eat, which would automatically lower the intake of 
trans fatty acids, the type found in margarine. 
</P>
<P>
Trans fatty acids are formed when fats and oils are hydrogenated. During this 
process, hydrogen molecules are added to polyunsaturated or monounsaturated 
oils, which turns the liquids into semi-solid shortenings or margarines. 
Hydrogenation not only imparts a creamy, firm texture to the products but 
prevents them from turning rancid. 
</P>
<P>
The more solid the fat, the more trans fatty acids it contains. Thus, stick 
margarines have slightly more trans fatty acids than those sold in tubs, while 
diet margarines and vegetable-oil spreads, which have more water and less fat 
than margarine and are also sold in tubs, have the least amount. 
</P>
<P>
On average, liquid "squeeze" margarines contain fewer trans fatty acids than 
any of the other choices, according to the National Assn. of Margarine 
Manufacturers. Sales of stick margarines have declined in the past 10 years, 
while sales of lower-fat vegetable-oil spreads and diet margarines have 
skyrocketed, from 15% to 41% of total sales. 
</P>
<P>
While Americans consume most trans fatty acids in margarines and hydrogenated 
oils found in processed foods, such as cookies, crackers and cakes, lesser 
amounts are contained in meat and dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have been concerned about the possible adverse health effects of 
trans fatty acids for years, according to Robert Nicolosi, a professor in the 
department of clinical science at the University of Lowell in Massachusetts. 
Aside from their effect on blood cholesterol levels, other possible adverse 
effects include their impact on the immune system, fat metabolism and a link 
with some kinds of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there is "very poor evidence and very few substantiating studies" 
that trans fatty acids have any detrimental health effect on humans in the 
levels consumed, said Nicolosi. These same conclusions were drawn in several 
recent reports, including one by FASEB. 
</P>
<P>
The study in the New England Journal of Medicine was the first to find that 
trans fatty acids lowered the "good" cholesterol in the blood, known as HDLs, 
or high-density lipoproteins, and raised the level of "bad" cholesterol in the 
blood, called LDLs, or low-density lipoproteins. Epidemiological evidence 
suggests that a high level of HDL in the blood is strongly correlated with a 
low risk of coronary heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
According to the New England Journal article, which used the FASEB study as its 
source, Americans consume between eight and 10 grams of trans fatty acids a 
day, or 6% to 8% of their daily fat consumption. Mary Enig, a research 
associate at the University of Maryland, believes that the daily average is 
more like 13 grams but that it can go as high as 38. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, another FASEB report stated that it is difficult to maintain a 
reliable estimate of the fatty-acid contents of foods, in part because 
manufacturers change the types of fats and oils they use, depending on price 
and availability. 
</P>
<P>
The New England Journal study, conducted in The Netherlands, placed 59 people 
on three three-week diets that varied in their fatty-acid composition. Based on 
their cholesterol profiles, participants' risk of heart disease was the 
greatest while following the diet containing a high level of trans fatty acids. 
</P>
<P>
Margarine manufacturers and other scientists have pointed out that the amounts 
of trans fatty acids and calories consumed in the study are far greater than 
those actually eaten by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
In their initial investigations, scientists frequently use large quantities of 
a given substance so that they can observe an effect, if there is one. 
Furthermore, the margarine eaten by participants was a formulation manufactured 
specifically for the study and is not commercially available.

MICROWAVE: SECRETS TO BAKING FROM-SCRATCH CAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe it's the proliferation of microwave cake mixes, maybe it's frenzied 
schedules, but whatever the reason, few microwave owners have learned how easy 
it is to toss together from-scratch batter and bake it by microwave. 
</P>
<P>
There are disadvantages, we'll admit. For example, the cakes don't brown the 
way they do in regular ovens. And they dry out too fast once they come from the 
microwave. 
</P>
<P>
But these are scarcely insurmountable problems. First of all, to compensate for 
the lack of browning, you need only to build a little color into the batter. 
</P>
<P>
As for the drying, that's hardly a problem. All you have to do is store the 
cake airtight as soon as it comes to room temperature. Our method is to 
double-wrap it in plastic wrap, then pop it into an airtight cake keeper or 
tin. That way it stays moist. 
</P>
<P>
CHERRY POUND CAKE 
</P>
<P>
2 cups sifted flour 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
1 cup butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 cup light-brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon almond flavoring 
</P>
<P>
4 eggs 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup finely chopped candied red cherries 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup powdered sugar, about 
</P>
<P>
Sift flour and baking powder. Cream butter until light. Gradually add brown 
sugar, beating until fluffy. Beat in vanilla and almond flavoring. Add eggs, 1 
at time, beating well after each addition. Mix in dry ingredients just until 
smooth. Fold in cherries. 
</P>
<P>
Spread batter evenly in greased microwave-safe, 9-inch (8-cup) ring mold. Rap 
lightly on counter to expel air bubbles. Center mold on microwave oven rack or 
elevate on microwave-safe, upside-down, shallow bowl. Microwave, uncovered, on 
MEDIUM (50% power) 10 minutes, rotating 180 degrees at half time. 
</P>
<P>
Rotate mold again 180 degrees and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 2 to 3 
minutes, or until wood pick inserted midway between rim and center comes out 
clean. (Any small moist areas will dry on standing.) 
</P>
<P>
Let cake stand, uncovered, in upright mold 10 minutes. Loosen cake all way to 
bottom of mold, invert onto plate, ease out and cool to room temperature. Sift 
powdered sugar evenly over cake just before serving. Makes 16 servings.

THE THAIS HAVE A WORD FOR IT: YUM; 
</P>
<P>
DELICACIES: IN TRADITIONAL THAI CUISINE, YUMS STAND ALONE AS DISHES TO BE 
NIBBLED AT LEISURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCIE McDERMOTT, McDermott has lived in Thailand and has written for 
various publications including Bon Appetit.

<TEXT>
<P>
When the back-to-school blues sap culinary spirits, take a lesson from cooks in 
the Southeast Asian kingdom of Thailand. Thai people aren't always in the mood 
to toil in the kitchen, but they're never too worn out to eat wonderful food. 
That's why their cuisine includes an array of fresh, simple dishes that sparkle 
with intense flavors. 
</P>
<P>
Thai salads make terrific autumn fare whether you're escaping Bangkok's turmoil 
in a riverside cafe or seeking an easy, appealing way to feed family and 
friends without wearing yourself out. Hearty, colorful jumbles of meat or 
seafood are intensely flavored with lime juice, chiles, cilantro and mint. 
Since most Thai salads are dressed without oil or cheese, they're also 
intrinsically healthful and tend to please first-timers and dedicated Thai food 
fans alike. 
</P>
<P>
I learned to love Thai salads during my Peace Corps days in Thailand. The Thai 
word for this particular category of dishes is yum. Unlike most Thai dishes 
that are created to season platefuls of plain, unsalted rice, yums stand alone 
as spicy, enticing dishes to be nibbled at leisure. 
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, yums are either the prelude to a meal or else a stand-alone snack. 
These robust, fiery dishes are usually paired with ice-cold beer or 
whiskey-and-soda, but I find that frosty glasses of lemonade or sparkling water 
temper the chiles equally well. 
</P>
<P>
California cuisine has ushered warm salads onto the list of dishes currently in 
vogue, and Thai salads fit into this niche. Meat or seafood predominates, which 
means they work nicely as a main course. And since they're best served warm or 
at room temperature, I can do all my chopping and other preparation work in 
advance and then assemble the yum when I'm just about ready to serve it. 
</P>
<P>
Thais prefer a meal full of contrasting flavors, and I quickly became a fan of 
this idea myself. I like to let my yum provide an exotic accent on a buffet of 
simple standards, leaving me free to enjoy my guests. Any leftovers provide me 
with a quick lunch or supper the day after the party. 
</P>
<P>
When I use a Thai salad as part of a buffet, I keep all the other dishes as 
simple as possible. Tortilla chips with salsa and several kinds of olives are 
out when guests arrive. Along with a Thai salad, I offer a pasta salad or 
potato salad, made up hours in advance so that it's cool and ready for 
presentation whenever I am. 
</P>
<P>
For a touch of color, I saute a skilletful of sugar snap peas or snow peas in a 
little olive oil just until they're shiny and brilliant green. In the same pan 
I saute cherry tomatoes for a minute or two, removing them when they're shiny 
and before they split open. Then I season to taste with salt and pepper the 
peas and tomatoes and transfer them to a platter. 
</P>
<P>
I round out the meal with two old Southern stand-bys that my North Carolina 
grandmother always used to please her guests. One is deviled eggs, which I 
spike with curry powder and minced green onions; the other is a homey bowl of 
carrot-raisin salad that the food processor can transform into a quick and easy 
dish. 
</P>
<P>
For a more elegant meal, I start with a simple leek and potato soup, which I 
can make the day before, and serve either warm or chilled. Plated servings of 
the beef or seafood salad follow, along with garlic toast. Since this menu 
leaves me ready for dessert, I finish up with either coffee ice cream with 
butter cookies at lunch or a luxurious, cool creme caramel at dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The four yum recipes that follow all use freshly squeezed lime juice for a 
burst of sharp, clean taste. If you're preparing things in advance, I suggest 
you postpone squeezing and mixing in the lime juice until serving time because 
its flavor turns harsh quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The beef salad is a standard in northeastern Thailand where robust grilled 
dishes are a specialty. It's delicious with leftover grilled beef, so I like to 
cook an extra steak whenever I'm grilling or broiling beef and make this salad 
the following day. 
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, cooks add crunch and fragrance to the beef salad with a spoonful 
of roasted rice powder. If you'd like to try this traditional touch, dry-fry 
grains of raw rice in an ungreased skillet over medium heat until they are 
wheaty-brown and fragrant. Then pound or grind them to a coarse, sandy powder, 
using a mortar and pestle or a coffee or spice grinder. 
</P>
<P>
The seafood salad works just as well with shrimp alone if you can't find or 
don't care for squid and bay scallops. An attractive way to present it as 
finger food is to place spoonfuls of the dressed seafood in lettuce cups, which 
are small crisp leaves of limestone or Boston lettuce. Using a slotted spoon to 
do this makes the lettuce cups neater. Guests pick up a seafood-laden leaf and 
roll it into a tube, taquito-style, before taking a bite. 
</P>
<P>
The pork salad also works well in lettuce cups. I like to garnish each cup with 
a sprig of fresh cilantro or a sprinkling of sliced green onions after 
arranging them on a serving platter. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Thai salad is rich with its creamy dressing of coconut milk and 
peanut butter. It works as a crudite platter for dipping as well as a composed 
salad to be passed at the table. Potato chips may not strike you as a 
traditional Thai ingredient but in this dish they are. 
</P>
<P>
You can expect some oil to separate from the peanut sauce as it cools. I stir 
it back in before serving, but you can also pour it off. If it thickens too 
much, thin the peanut sauce with a little additional chicken broth. 
</P>
<P>
If you like the spicy peanut sauce, also use it on satays, which are skewers of 
pork, chicken or shrimp, grilled or broiled. It's also delicious on a pasta 
salad, tossed with sliced green onions and minced cilantro on the corkscrew 
pasta called rotelle and served either warm or cold. 
</P>
<P>
Three exotic ingredients are called for in the following recipes: fish sauce, 
red curry paste and coconut milk. These are now widely available in Asian 
markets and even in some supermarkets. Fish sauce and red curry pastes will 
keep for months, the fish sauce at room temperature and the curry paste 
transferred from the can to a glass jar and refrigerated. Coconut milk is much 
more fragile once the can is opened, so be sure to chill any leftovers and use 
them up within a day or two.

ELECTIONS POMONA COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
WOULD-BE SUCCESSORS TO POLITICAL MAVERICK BRYANT TREAD SOFTLY 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until he was recalled in June, C. L. (Clay) Bryant was the City Council's 
maverick: bold and blunt, outgoing, outspoken and outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
His would-be successors describe themselves as stable, solid and practical. 
They pause before they speak and choose their words carefully. 
</P>
<P>
After a time of turbulence in city government, "people are looking for somebody 
with stability and common sense," candidate Boyd Bredenkamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Dahms and Nancy Lopez, who are competing with Bredenkamp in the Sept. 18 
special election to fill the unexpired portion of Bryant's term, said they 
admired Bryant for his compassionate nature and his ambition to improve the 
city, but not for his style. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need to make a public ordeal of your problems," Dahms said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said Bryant put too much energy into political battles. "Why waste time 
getting even, when there is so much to do?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even though the candidates have been cautious in their remarks, the 
campaign has been heating up. A Bredenkamp supporter has filed a complaint with 
the city clerk accusing Dahms of lying about his address when he registered to 
vote. And the mayor and council members have harshly attacked each other over 
their involvement in the campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
By a 2-1 margin, voters in June recalled Bryant after a yearlong campaign in 
which he was accused of browbeating employees, catering to special interests 
and making racist remarks. Bryant denied the charges, insisting that he was 
under attack because he sided with the downtrodden against powerful business 
and civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Bredenkamp helped start the drive to recall Bryant. Lopez circulated recall 
petitions. 
</P>
<P>
Bredenkamp, in an effort to link Dahms to the ousted councilman, said Dahms had 
an anti-recall sign in his business window and was allied with Bryant. Dahms 
said he supported some things Bryant did and opposed others. As for the recall 
sign in his window, Dahms said he always allows all political candidates to 
post signs on his property. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will complete a term that runs until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Bredenkamp, 49, grew up in Nebraska and was a truck driver for 10 years before 
coming to Pomona in 1974 to buy a doughnut shop on Mission Boulevard that he 
still operates. 
</P>
<P>
He has been active in a number of youth and business groups and also serves on 
the Planning Commission. He and his wife, Judy, have two children, 16 and 20. 
</P>
<P>
Bredenkamp is running with the backing of unions representing city 
firefighters, police officers and general city employees, the first time all 
three employee groups have united behind a candidate since 1960. He also has 
the backing of Mayor Donna Smith. 
</P>
<P>
On the Planning Commission, he has consistently voted against new housing 
developments because they would increase the population, adding to school 
overcrowding. Bredenkamp said he has been trying to send a message to the 
council that it should work with the school board to relieve overcrowding. "You 
can't have a quality city without quality schools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious problem facing the city, he said, is crime. Bredenkamp said 
the Police Department needs more officers and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Dahms, 33, said he too believes that crime is "at an intolerable level." 
</P>
<P>
"We need to provide a better, more efficient Police Department," he said. "I'd 
like to take a look at the upper management and make sure we are running it as 
efficiently as we can within the resources the department has." 
</P>
<P>
Dahms said the city must step up efforts to combat gangs. "We need to create 
the stigma that belonging to gangs is no longer cool," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dahms came to Pomona from Chicago 12 years ago, establishing a business 
involved in electronic security systems and military and aerospace work. Dahms 
said he has attended several colleges, but does not have a degree. He is a 
member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
He is president of the Central Business District, which is working to revive 
downtown Pomona, and also sits on several other boards of civic organizations. 
He has been so successful in business, Dahms said, that he can now devote most 
of his time to community service. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, 52, who was born in Pomona and has lived here nearly all of her life, is 
campaigning with the promise of becoming a full-time council member. 
</P>
<P>
But, unlike Bryant, who prided himself on being the people's watchdog on duty 
every day at City Hall, Lopez said she would not be looking over the shoulders 
of employees and would leave them alone to do their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Married 33 years and the mother of four children, Lopez has a long record of 
volunteering in community efforts. A founder of the Hispanic Youth Task Force 
to deal with gang problems, she conducts career weeks at Pomona schools and 
stages fiestas at the Civic Center on Mexican holidays in May and September. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said she would bring to the council a strong understanding of the 
community and its needs. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three candidates on the ballot, Lopez is by far the most outspoken. 
"People in the community know me as very bossy, very forward, very direct," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She was the only candidate to run against Bryant last year at the regular 
municipal election, before he joined with two other council members to fire the 
city administrator and became a recall target. She lost, 4,110 to 3,230. 
</P>
<P>
Although 30% of Pomona's population is Latino, Lopez said her Latino heritage 
may work against her in the election. "There is a lot of support for me out in 
the community," she said, "but people are saying that we already have two 
Hispanics on the City Council." The council has five members, including the 
mayor, although a ballot measure approved in June will expand the council to 
seven members next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said she is asking voters to "judge me on the basis of who I am and what 
I have done, not who I represent." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tomas Ursua said he thinks the big obstacle for Lopez is not that 
she would join Nell Soto and himself as the council's third Latino but that she 
is under-qualified. "People are looking for a higher-trained elected official 
these days," he said. He dismissed Lopez as a community volunteer with links to 
the Establishment. "She's the kind of person who doesn't question the system," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lopez claims that the Police Department has not hired enough Latino 
officers and attacks council members for allegedly putting their political 
ambitions ahead of community service. "Everybody on that (council) right now 
has his own self-interest," she said. "They are not interested or concerned for 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Lopez is the only candidate on the ballot who is not being 
backed by an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Smith has endorsed Bredenkamp, and Ursua has endorsed Dahms. Soto on 
Tuesday announced she is endorsing Dahms. Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer said he 
will remain neutral. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsements carry some political weight, but also some extra baggage. 
Dahms and Lopez claim that Bredenkamp would be under the thumb of Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said Smith is "looking for a puppet . . . someone she can manipulate and 
get some of the power she wants." 
</P>
<P>
Bredenkamp said his family and Smith's have been friends for years through 
youth sports organizations in which they both participated, starting with 
Little League. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we are friends," he said, "is that our basic philosophies are the 
same. Whenever we've gotten involved in any project, Little League or whatever, 
we've always worked for the good of the organization." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he would vote with Smith most of the time on the council because 
they think alike but that he has differences with her too. "I can think for 
myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Mulligan, who heads the Pomona City Employees Assn., said his group and 
associations representing police officers and firefighters interviewed the 
three candidates and concluded that Bredenkamp was the most knowledgeable and 
experienced. Mulligan said the associations will provide volunteer labor and 
contribute money as well. 
</P>
<P>
Bredenkamp has raised the most money, according to campaign reporting 
statements filed by the candidates for the period ending Sept. 1. Bredenkamp 
had amassed $10,999. Dahms had raised $8,569, including $1,250 from labor 
unions and $1,350 of his own money. Lopez reported $1,899 in contributions, 
including $1,110 from her husband. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the three candidates on the ballot, George Bosy, a motel 
operator who has clashed with the city over efforts to aid the homeless, took 
out papers to file as a write-in candidate, but failed to submit them by the 
filing deadline.

HOW HOT IS IT?; 
</P>
<P>
SOME PEOPLE FIND RELIEF -- IT'S ICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sure, the air out there feels as if somebody thought you were tonight's rib 
roast and slipped you into the oven at a slow bake. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't have to take it. This is 1990, and there are things you can do 
about the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Like get a job at an ice house. While his friends melt in their back yards and 
living rooms, Steven Fierro, 17, an Azusa High School senior, toddles off to 
the Monrovia Ice Co. in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
Here, in blissfully frigid air, he helps to shepherd a torrent of ice cubes 
into plastic bags, or chops steaming 300-pound blocks down to size with an ice 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
If he finds himself getting a little overheated -- during the hot weather, the 
plant on Huntington Drive can spit out as much as 20 tons of ice a day -- 
Fierro just strolls into the storeroom, where all those bags of cubes are kept 
at an icy 20 degrees. Here, Fierro and co-worker Eric Leal take a few breaths 
of arctic air and think about what it must be like outside. 
</P>
<P>
"On days like this," Fierro said, "I just want to come to work." 
</P>
<P>
There's no relief in sight. Rick Dittman, a meteorologist with Weather Data 
Inc., said there is a huge high pressure system parked on top of Southern 
California like a lid on a barbecue grill, with the San Gabriel Valley right in 
the middle. 
</P>
<P>
The normal "thermal trough," with offshore breezes wafting across the region, 
has been reversed, Dittman said. "Now you have winds blowing down from the east 
and the north, and cities like Monrovia, at the base of a huge mountain range, 
are in a perfect position for really hot weather," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia reached highs of 109 degrees for three days running this week, and 
other foothill cities were experiencing similar temperatures. The prospects are 
for similar weather through the weekend, Dittman said. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley residents have been finding lots of ways to escape that 
oven, or at least to step away from its direct blast. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody seems to have a favorite escape. There are back-yard swimming pools 
and Raging Waters, the water attraction in Bonelli Park in San Dimas. There are 
home air conditioners, shopping malls and air-conditioned movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Some cool-off strategies can't be shared. "I go home and sit in front of the 
air conditioner buck naked," a 16-year-old Pasadena girl said. 
</P>
<P>
At times like this, Sandy Gollihugh knows she's in the right business. As the 
rest of Pasadena contends with 104 degrees, Gollihugh is zipped into a heavy 
leather jacket for her job as an ice-skating instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it gets cold in here," Gollihugh said, leaning against the rail at 
the Pasadena Ice Skating Center on East Green Street. "On days like today, I 
know I made the right choice." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, there were great stretches of open ice at the center, as some of 
Gollihugh's students practiced their pirouettes and figure eights. A group of 
high school students from the Siloam Church Youth Group in Paramount celebrated 
their last day of vacation, charging around the rink in a chain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of tradition with us," said Sarah Choe, 16, a student at Warren 
High School in Downey. "We come here every year." 
</P>
<P>
Across the street at the Plaza Pasadena mall, the pace was slow, and the 
atmosphere was cool. Pedro Lopez, a retired store clerk from Pasadena, 
confessed that he had been in the mall for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very agreeable here," he said, sitting on a main-floor bench, with not 
the least inclination to move on. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not into winter sports and malls aren't your cup of tea, there's 
always Pasadena Superior Court. Court-watchers there are keeping their eyes on 
the trials being played out in air-conditioned courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Out at the Los Angeles County Fair, at the Fairplex in Pomona, four of the 
exhibit halls are air-conditioned for the first time. And horse racing begins 
today. For $3, you can watch the races from the air-conditioned clubhouse. Or 
for a $5 minimum, you can take a table at the race track's Top of the Park 
restaurant, which has a panoramic view of the track and its own parimutuel 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people head for the mountains. Mt. Wilson was a moderate 89 degrees 
Tuesday, 20 degrees lower than some of the cities below. Just as important, Mt. 
Wilson weather observer Lu Rarogeiwicz said, the 5,800-foot mountain is above 
the smog line. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley ozone levels have been soaring into the "very unhealthful" 
range most days this week. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a heavy blanket over the Basin," Rarogeiwicz said from his mountaintop 
perspective. "I can't really see into it -- it's a lovely brown color. But it's 
clear overhead. I can see all the way to San Clemente and San Nicolas islands, 
between 100 and 110 miles away." 
</P>
<P>
If the heat should fray tempers to the boiling point, there's plenty of room at 
the Pasadena Police Department lockup. "We can house 43 people here," Sgt. Jay 
D'Angelo said. "All of our cells are air-conditioned."

Nail salons looking for a toehold in South Pasadena may be out of luck soon. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Amedee Richards suggested at last week's council meeting that the 
city investigate the possibility of limiting the number of certain types of 
commercial enterprises in South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said he would like to see a "balancing of the nature of the businesses 
we have here." 
</P>
<P>
He cited a recent survey by the South Pasadena Chamber of Commerce, which found 
that there are 18 hair and nail salons, 16 fast-food restaurants, 15 
dry-cleaning shops and seven video rental stores in the 3.4-square-mile city. 
</P>
<P>
The matter was referred to the Planning Commission for further study. STEVE 
HIRANO

STATISTICS: FIGURES RELEASED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOW MAJOR CRIME DOWN IN 
THE TWO LARGEST CITIES IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. ANTI-GANG PROGRAMS WERE 
CREDITED WITH HELPING THE DECLINE.

Pomona and Pasadena, the San Gabriel Valley's most populous and crime-ridden 
cities, recorded decreases in major crime for the first six months of 1990, 
according to preliminary figures released by the state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
The decline stood in contrast to figures reported by all of the state's 52 
biggest police agencies, which combined logged increases in nearly every 
category of crime compared to the first half of 1989, the report from the 
attorney general's bureau of criminal statistics showed. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions in Pomona and Pasadena also reversed some of the increases 
registered last year in the two cities, which had more major offenses per 1,000 
residents than any other San Gabriel Valley communities. 
</P>
<P>
"A few months doesn't make a track record," Pomona Police Capt. Chuck Heilman 
said. "But we're hoping that what we're doing is on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, which last year recorded a 2.2% gain in crime, was down 6.2% for the 
first half of 1990, according to the state report. 
</P>
<P>
Between January and June, the city had 17 murders, compared to 25 for the same 
period in 1989, representing a 32% decrease. Assault dropped 5.1%, burglary 
went down 16.1% and theft sunk by 5.4% 
</P>
<P>
The only categories to show increases were robbery, which climbed from 386 to 
434, a 12.4% increase, and rape, which went from 31 to 39, up 26%. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, where serious crimes rose 14.9% in 1989, there was a 13% drop for 
the first six months of this year, the report showed. 
</P>
<P>
Murders were down from 11 to eight, a 27% decrease. Robbery dropped by 5.5%, 
assault fell 30.7%, burglary sunk 22.5%, and theft was cut by 10.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Increases were logged only in arson, which went from 34 to 46 incidents, up 
35%; auto theft, which inched from 670 to 675, a 0.7% rise, and rape, which was 
up from 20 to 29, an increase of 45%. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Police Lt. Gregg Henderson attributed the decreases to an anti-gang 
task force formed at the end of last year and to other programs that have 
landed some of the city's hard-core criminals in jail. But because the 
offenders will eventually get out, he cautioned against celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
"Statistically, it looks good and people feel good when they hear crime is 
down," Henderson said. "But if you live and die by stats, you're going to die. 
. . . Next month, you could be calling me and saying, 'Hey, did you know your 
stats went up 10%?' " 
</P>
<P>
Pomona police, who last year ended up investigating a record 44 homicides, also 
attributed their declines to special programs focusing on gang members. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, officers have tried to keep tabs on those youths thought to be 
the "shot-callers" -- the most active and violent members of their clique -- by 
taking them into custody on what used to be considered minor parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of trying to catch a guy doing something, we can now pick him up for 
being with another gang member or knock at his door at 7 in the morning and 
search his room," Heilman said. "The word is out that the courts are taking 
these things seriously." 
</P>
<P>
The state report, which only included figures from police agencies that serve 
populations greater than 100,000, found that robbery was the fastest growing 
crime in California, with an increase of 16.2% over the first half of 1989. 
Murder was next, with a 9.6% increase. Rape followed with a 7.6% jump. And 
assaults grew by 4.9% 
</P>
<P>
But because there was a drop in the huge number of thefts, overall crime 
statewide was down 0.7% over last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department reported a 0.2% decrease over 1989. And the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department logged a 3.7% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Final numbers for the year will be released by the FBI in the summer of 1991.

BUILDING PERMIT LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An emergency moratorium to prohibit issuance of building permits for large home 
expansions in the city's residential zones was extended Tuesday by the Board of 
Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions, originally approved in April, will stay in place until 
October, 1991, to allow city staff members time to devise permanent regulations 
against "mansionization," the building of large homes or additions that dwarf 
neighboring houses. 
</P>
<P>
A public workshop on the proposed rules for home sizes is scheduled for 7 p.m. 
Sept. 20 at the Pasadena Police Department's assembly room, 207 N. Garfield 
Ave.

CITY MAY NEED TO BUY WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the drought persists through the winter, the city will be forced to buy 
additional water, Mayor George Maurer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, the city has enacted a voluntary conservation program to reduce 
water consumption by 10%. But if the voluntary measures aren't enough, Sierra 
Madre may adopt a mandatory conservation program by next March, Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
The city offers free water conservation kits and a list of conservation tips 
for residents at City Hall, 232 W. Sierra Madre Blvd.

WASTE CENTER MAY REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials hope to reopen next week a household hazardous-waste program 
that was closed for nearly five months. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Perkins, administrative and environmental services manager for the city's 
general services department, said storage and labeling problems identified by 
the state Department of Health Services forced the closure in April. 
</P>
<P>
The problems have been corrected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials are scheduled to inspect the facility this week for 
recertification. Perkins said that if the city passes the inspection, the 
center will open Wednesday through Saturday from 7:30 a.m. to noon beginning 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The center, at the city yard at 2500 Michigan Ave., will accept household 
hazardous waste such as paint, paint thinner, motor oil, pesticides and bleach. 
The facility is open only to Santa Monica residents, and disposals are limited 
to a maximum of five containers of five gallons each.

GAS STATION PERMIT REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing increased traffic, noise and safety problems, the City Council 
unanimously denied a permit request for a 24-hour Arco gas station and 
mini-market at the southwest corner of Buena Vista Street and Duarte Road, in 
an area zoned for apartment buildings and houses. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision Tuesday came after an hour-long public hearing during 
which residents spoke both for and against the proposed Arco station. 
</P>
<P>
Those in favor said the station and mini-market would provide a convenient 
place for residents to shop. Those against, including Duarte Unified School 
District officials, said the station would be an "attractive nuisance," 
creating traffic, noise and loitering.

MORE PARKING METERS OKD

<P>
The City Council unanimously approved the installation of about 600 parking 
meters on seven streets. 
</P>
<P>
The additional meters, to be installed on streets including Washington, 
Sepulveda, Culver and Robertson boulevards, are expected to generate $80,000 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
The council also authorized $27,000 to pay for a community services officer for 
meter collection. The meters, which will be installed over a three-month 
period, are expected to produce $140,000 in parking violation fines. 
</P>
<P>
Affected businesses will be notified of a public hearing that will be held 
before installation of the new meters. 
</P>
<P>
The city will also remove poles that were installed two years ago without 
meters along Washington Boulevard between Zanja and Girard streets.

PREFERENTIAL PARKING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to resident complaints, the City Council has directed city staff to 
devise a system of preferential resident parking on Keystone and Coombs 
avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Keystone Avenue complained of a continuous parking spillover from 
the nearby Los Angeles County offices during business hours. 
</P>
<P>
Although police say they have increased enforcement, residents said there has 
been no difference. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of streets near Veterans Memorial Park, including Coombs Avenue, also 
complained of excess parking from the park. They complained to council members 
that park visitors were changing from business clothes to athletic attire on 
their front lawns. They asked the council to extend the weekday, daytime 
parking restrictions so that park users would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
The new parking guidelines will be presented at the council meeting Sept. 24.

</P>
<P>
Merchants who have businesses, including haircutting and retail sales, on 
Montana Avenue complained that a one-hour limit would be insufficient for their 
customers. But the council rejected the merchants' request for two-hour or 
90-minute parking. 
</P>

MAIN STREET ZONING CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After seeing that the west end of Main Street isn't destined to become an 
automobile row after all, the City Council decided Monday to change the zoning 
back to general commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager P. Michael Paules said in a report that the automobile 
zoning was established in 1986 when the city's General Plan was revised. 
However, Paules said the city has since realized the area is unsuitable for an 
auto strip, in part because of the shallowness of the lots. 
</P>
<P>
Paules said the change means businesses other than automobile dealerships will 
not have to obtain a conditional-use permit from the city to operate in the 
area.

The City Council agreed Monday to give members of the Police Employees' Assn. a

</P>
<P>
City Manager Kevin Murphy said the city and association, which represents 
civilian police employees, will reopen contract negotiations in six months

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: TO MARVEL AT HOW MUCH HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED ON 
INSPIRATION AND WILL ALONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When last mentioned here in March, the Glendale Teen Center was a fresh new 
idea, brought to life in rich detail by a young woman named Sheila Ellis, who 
believes that Glendale youth need a safe place to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
It was on the west side of town in a warehouse. It was well-appointed, with 
everything a teen-ager would need -- a soda fountain, a pool table and 
Ping-Pong table, a study room, a TV room, a conversation room. It had two 
adults on staff and a minimum of two trained teen-age volunteers in attendance 
each weeknight to befriend the young people who would drop in. 
</P>
<P>
All that was lacking then was securing a lease and coming up with financial 
commitments of around $135,000 a year. The target date was fall. 
</P>
<P>
Now that fall is here, the center might appear to have fallen short of its 
goal. It still has no lease and its balance sheet is hanging in at around 
$10,000, half from a community event in March and the rest a donation from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, who also happens to be pursuing a career as a Chicago-style blues 
vocalist, has learned a lot about the mechanics of building an institution from 
the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
She said she had no idea how hard it was going to be. The problem, which should 
be clear and imposing enough to discourage all but the most serious dreamer, is 
this: You can't get someone to hand over a lot of money without having 
something of substance to show -- such as a lease on a building -- and you 
can't afford to sign a lease without having a lot money in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Another way of looking at it, though, is to marvel at how much has been 
accomplished on inspiration and will alone. 
</P>
<P>
In the months since, Ellis and her many supporters have gone about laying a 
foundation of ideas and people, never doubting that, when the moment comes, the 
building and money will materialize. 
</P>
<P>
They have recruited real estate agents, lawyers and civic leaders to their 
board of directors. They conducted and published an assessment of the emotional 
and recreational needs of the city's teen-agers, documenting the value of a 
center. 
</P>
<P>
When the time came to decide whether to sign a lease without having the cash to 
cover it, the board was confident enough to do so. Negotiations are going on 
for a building on West Arden Avenue. Ellis is developing a list of major donors 
to tap when the moment is right. 
</P>
<P>
An equally important, and more delicate, job quietly began this summer with a 
group of teen-agers gathering each Wednesday evening in Ellis' pleasant home in 
the Kenneth Road neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, nominated by their teachers and counselors at school, are members 
of the Teen Center's Young Person's Council. They have two duties: to govern 
the center -- in conjunction with its adult program director and board -- and 
to volunteer time each week as teen peer counselors. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen showed up at last week's meeting. As there were too many for 
formal seating, Ellis pushed the couches aside and motioned all to form a 
circle. In khaki shorts, she sat down lithely, Indian style, setting a 
vegetarian dinner in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
The first half hour of the meeting concerned governance. On the agenda was the 
"term of commitment" clause in the group's bylaws. Ellis questioned whether the 
stated term of three months was long enough and whether renewal should be at 
the discretion of the director or the youths themselves. 
</P>
<P>
She tried to work by consensus, which proved difficult. Some said that three 
months was too long or that their schedules -- one young woman was taking 
geometry and trigonometry at the same time -- would make two hours every week 
difficult. One young man said he worked better when not tied to a routine. 
</P>
<P>
Others argued that without commitment, the organization would fail. And one 
young woman said she found it hard to tolerate those who simply showed up when 
they chose. 
</P>
<P>
To settle the disagreement, Ellis introduced the idea of a "floater," someone 
whose schedule, or character, could not conform to a regular assignment. 
</P>
<P>
It was agreed at last that the term would be three months, that the power to 
appoint would rest solely with the youth council and that volunteer shifts 
would be planned only a week at a time so that no one would get stuck. Floaters 
would be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The second half was about feelings. Judy Yager, psychotherapist with the 
Glendale Unified School District, told the youths that to be good listeners, 
they would have to know themselves. She asked each to identify two of their own 
qualities, one good and one bad. The bad, she said, hoping to soften a hard 
concept, could be an imperfection they were still working on. 
</P>
<P>
The first young woman said she was honest and direct and couldn't think of much 
that needed working on. With prodding from a friend, however, she remembered 
that she was trying to stop fighting with her father. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the youths were harder on themselves. The bad qualities included 
interrupting, rudeness and difficulty with words. By observation, a couple of 
positive qualities they didn't mention would be determination and trust. 
</P>
<P>
These young people are working hard toward a goal. And they're trusting that 
the adults will come through.

BAN ON HOUSE ADDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homeowners who want to add a second story may have to wait until February 
because the City Council has decided to extend an urgency ordinance that 
temporarily prohibits such additions to single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The extension, approved Tuesday, will be in effect until Feb. 1, to give city 
staff members move time to study the issue. However, if the study is finished 
before Feb. 1, the moratorium may be lifted earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The ban went into effect July 24 to allow the city to determine whether new 
regulations are needed to ensure that second-story additions do not infringe on 
the rights of neighboring properties.

JURY WON'T RULE ON GARAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County grand jury has decided not to get involved in a 
long-standing dispute between Monterey Park and several residents over a 
parking garage, city officials announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the City Council asked the grand jury to look into residents' 
complaints that a new parking structure at Garvey Medical Center violates the 
city's three-story maximum for that area. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say it is legal because it is a parking structure, not a 
commercial building, and is exempt from the three-story rule. 
</P>
<P>
But the grand jury's Government Operations Committee said that although it 
found no misconduct when the city approved construction of the parking garage, 
ruling on its legality isn't within its jurisdiction, Mayor Judy Chu said 
Tuesday. Grand jury officials couldn't be reached for comment.

CHANGE IN RENT LAW CONSIDERED; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: THE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR LANDLORDS WHO PLAN TO GO OUT OF THE RENTAL 
BUSINESS TO CARRY THROUGH WITH EVICTIONS WITHIN 60 DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of the continuing tug-of-war between landlords and rent control 
hard-liners in Santa Monica, city rent control officials are contemplating a 
tightening of regulations governing the circumstances under which landlords can 
evict tenants and go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal scheduled for a public hearing tonight before the Rent Control Board 
would require landlords who file notice of their intent to evict tenants and 
remove their properties from the rental market to carry through with the 
evictions within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the rent board, which is dominated by tenant partisans, say the 
change is needed because they say some landlords have been filing notices of 
intent to evict tenants to induce tenants to vacate apartments voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the tight rental market in Santa Monica, the argument goes, many 
tenants who are notified of a landlord's intent to evict do not wait for a 
formal eviction notice before finding another apartment. These tenants are 
inclined to grab another rent-controlled apartment whenever they can find one. 
</P>
<P>
When this happens, rent board officials say, some landlords then rent the 
apartments to more desirable tenants -- particularly people with higher incomes 
who might also be willing to pay under-the-table "finders fees" for a 
rent-controlled apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The eviction process under rent control is governed by a state law called the 
Ellis Act, which sets forth the conditions under which landlords can evict 
tenants and remove their property from the rental market and use it for some 
another purpose. For Santa Monica landlords, chronically unhappy with the low 
rents allowed by the rent board, the Ellis law has become their primary weapon 
for striking back and attempting to force change. 
</P>
<P>
The rent board's new proposal is an attempt to fine-tune local regulations 
implementing the Ellis Act. In addition to preventing landlords from seeking to 
create voluntary vacancies, the proposed change is designed to remove the 
uncertainty of whether or not the evictions will take place, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Ellis Act took effect in 1986, owners of about 200 apartment 
buildings in Santa Monica have filed notices with the city of their intent to 
evict tenants and go out of business, according to rent board officials. 
However, only about three-quarters of those landlords have gone forward with 
the evictions. 
</P>
<P>
Rent Control Board officials say owners of 141 properties with about 700 units 
have evicted tenants. Twenty owners subsequently withdrew their applications, 
and 34 applications affecting 335 units are in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
It is the applications in limbo -- where the threat of eviction exists but the 
landlord has not taken any further action and continues business as usual -- 
that the proposed changes would affect. "Ellis has been used to intimidate 
tenants, and the most valuable change is that it would basically stop landlords 
from making such threats," said rent board commissioner Wayne Bauer, who favors 
the change. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is going to stop (evictions), but it will force landlords to 
be serious about it," rent board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis said. "At least 
it lets tenants know that it's for real." 
</P>
<P>
But Carl Lambert, an attorney and landlord, calls the proposed requirement a 
meaningless change that detracts from the real issue behind the growing number 
of Ellis filings: that the existing system has made the business not worthwhile 
for landlords. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the regulatory changes being considered by the rent board may 
prove insignificant compared to changes in the rent control system that could 
result from the Nov. 6 election. Two ballot measures dealing with rent control 
-- one sponsored by landlords and a competing measure proposed by rent-control 
advocates -- would allow for substantial increases in rents on voluntarily 
vacated apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert and other landlords contend that unless the landlord-backed measure 
passes, permitting virtual decontrol of rents when apartments are voluntarily 
vacated, there will be a surge of Ellis Act evictions and a sharp decline in 
the number of apartments in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The rent board's public hearing tonight is at 7:30 in the City Hall Council 
Chamber.

END OF THE LINE FOR TROLLEY CARS; 
</P>
<P>
MONTEREY PARK: AFTER A FOUR-YEAR EXPERIMENT, THE CITY SEES THE FOLLY OF ITS 
TROLLEYS. THEY'RE JUST TOO IMPRACTICAL AND TOO EXPENSIVE. 
</P>

MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's bright red and green "trolley cars," now classified as an experiment 
that failed, will soon give way to carpeted transit buses. 
</P>
<P>
For four years, the trolleys-on-wheels have rolled up and down city streets 
five days a week, 12 hours a day, each month taking 15,000 passengers to places 
Rapid Transit District buses don't go, for just a quarter a ride. 
</P>
<P>
But although the novelty of the trolleys hasn't worn off, city officials say 
the vehicles are impractical. They guzzle gas, break down on steep climbs and 
are expensive to repair, Parks and Recreation Director Susan Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Navis, the city's transit consultant, said Wednesday that the trolley 
cars probably were a mistake, but "hindsight's 20-20. . . . The city didn't 
have any experience in transportation at the time. The trolleys were not doing 
what they were expected to do, but how do you know that (in advance)?" 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Monday decided to scrap the trolleys and replace them with 
ordinary 23-passenger transit buses similar to the kind used by automobile 
rental agencies. The buses, to be in service by June, 1991, will come equipped 
with wheelchair ramps, which the trolleys do not have. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of paying a transportation company $450,000 a year to run five trolley 
routes, Monterey Park will use Proposition A sales tax money to buy five buses 
for about $110,000 each under a lease-purchase agreement with an as-yet 
undetermined operator. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city will pay more at first under the lease-purchase arrangement, 
it will save money in maintenance and repairs over time, Navis said. Rides will 
still cost 25 cents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The trolley just eats up all the money," Hunt said. "While they're pretty to 
look at, they don't have a heavyweight body. Their useful life is over." 
</P>
<P>
The city's hilly terrain has taken its toll on the trolleys, which weigh only 
12,000 pounds, compared with the sturdier 22,000-pound transit buses. Hunt said 
trolleys have broken down, sometimes leaving riders stranded. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Fred Balderrama, who cast the lone vote against the plan to purchase 
buses, said the city instead should pay a transit company to run the bus routes 
to avoid liability when the buses are old and in need of repair. "Monterey Park 
has a lot of hills," he said. "There'll be a lot of wear and tear on those 
buses." 
</P>
<P>
Navis, who recommended switching to buses, said the trolleys "served a purpose 
in attracting riders. It was unique and different and fun -- it was a novelty." 
But the transit system needs to be more reliable than the trolleys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Covina, meanwhile, began running its own trolley routes last month, promoting 
the new system as "the return of the Red Cars." 
</P>
<P>
"We have had a few breakdowns since we've started, but we're hoping those are 
just inconsistencies," said Paul Hogan, administrative analyst in charge of 
transportation programs. The city owns two trolleys and pays a private company 
$174,000 a year to run the lines.

ELKS, BUILDER OK LEASE FOR HOTEL, LODGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An agreement has been signed between the Glendale Elks and a local developer to 
build a five-story hotel and lodge on the site of the club's historic building, 
which was destroyed by arson more than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A signing ceremony was held last Thursday after almost two years of 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement grants the developer, the Howard-Platz Group of Glendale, a 
long-term lease on the property at 120 E. Colorado St., said P. Dennis Keenan, 
the club's attorney. Terms of the agreement and financial arrangements have not 
been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The developer plans to build a 162-room business-class hotel on the Colorado 
Street frontage and a three-story lodge to the rear, on Elk Street. A single 
240-space garage with one level of subterranean parking will serve both 
facilities, Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
Only the gutted remnant of the 1917 lodge, which was listed on the city's 
roster of historic places and had one of the largest auditoriums of any Elks 
facility in the nation, has occupied the site since the $2-million blaze in 
January, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Since the fire, the Elks operated out of a 1940s-era addition at the rear of 
the property until May, when they moved to rented quarters at the Pasadena Elks 
Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Demolition at the Glendale site is scheduled for mid-October. Excavation and 
construction is to begin early next year, with completion expected in the 
spring of 1992, said a spokeswoman for Michael Howard, project director. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel will be a franchise of Compri, a nationwide chain based in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Before the fire, some members of the 122-year-old patriotic fraternal 
organization complained that the dilapidated old lodge was too large and too 
expensive for the club's dwindling membership to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Cost of renovation was estimated at more than $1 million. The club had sought 
to have the building's historic status removed so that it could be razed.

PASADENA OKS PANEL TO OVERSEE UPGRADES IN NORTHWEST AREA

A permanent, seven-member Northwest Commission to oversee city improvements and 
services in Pasadena's largest minority neighborhood was approved Tuesday by 
the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
Also approved were recommendations to improve conditions in the Northwest, 
including hiring a Northwest grant writer and an advocate/manager answerable to 
the city manager; establishing a city Housing Authority, and completing by 1993 
major capital improvements planned more than five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We, the staff, want to see this plan succeed and are going to devote massive 
resources of time and energy to make it happen," City Manager Philip Hawkey 
said. "I think we understand the spirit. I think we're on the same wavelength." 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations by the Northwest Task Force came after an eight-month study 
that found the city had not made the $35 million in capital improvements 
promised in the Northwest Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Directors adopted the plan in 1985 as a new beginning for the low-income, 
predominantly black and Latino area. 
</P>
<P>
But community activists demanded action after they said conditions had not 
changed much in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Northwest Task Force concluded that the city had failed to find grant, 
state or federal money for the area but tallied everyday city spending as part 
of the plan. Total capital spending was only $25 million, the task force said. 
</P>
<P>
Some board members were reluctant to approve the recommendations without first 
assessing whether the city, with budget and staff restrictions, can actually 
carry them out. 
</P>
<P>
"When we approve something in concept, no one quite knows what it means," 
Director William Thomson said. He added that approval could create expectations 
that might not be met and the directors would find themselves "back where we 
started." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Reynolds, who chaired the task force, said its members recognized that 
changes would be a long process, requiring monitoring by the new commission.

GONZALEZ BRINGS FRANKLIN FLAVOR TO NEW POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Armando Gonzalez left high school coaching in May to take the job as offensive 
coordinator for the East Los Angeles College football program. 
</P>
<P>
And after a week of play, it appears Gonzalez has supplied the Huskies with the 
kind of firepower that helped him win four City Section 3-A Division titles in 
eight seasons at Franklin. Last Saturday, East L.A. rolled up 505 yards in 
defeating Pierce, 32-31. 
</P>
<P>
Seven players from the Franklin team that defeated Garfield for the 3-A title 
last season followed Gonzalez to East L.A. One of them is quarterback Santiago 
Alvarez, the 3-A Player of the Year who led the state in passing with more than 
4,000 yards. He completed 32 of 46 passes for 395 yards and four touchdowns 
against Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
"The size and speed of the defenses we're going to play against are a lot 
different," Gonzalez said. "And they're going to be better prepared than the 
high school teams. 
</P>
<P>
"But this was a good way to get started." 
</P>
<P>
For openers: The Glendale College football team lost to Pasadena, 17-7, in its 
opener last Saturday, but Vaquero Coach John Cicuto was not disappointed with 
his team's performance against the Lancers, who were ranked fourth in the 
nation in one preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our biggest question mark would be defense, but our kids played with 
tremendous intensity," Cicuto said. "There were situations where Pasadena had 
the ball at the three, the 10 and the 20 and our defense came up with plays." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Glendale's offense was unable to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Marco Arcipreste had two passes intercepted, killing second-half drives into 
Pasadena territory. 
</P>
<P>
Cicuto also called the play of Glendale's special teams, "atrocious." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale has a bye this week before meeting Bakersfield College in its Western 
State Conference opener Sept. 22 at Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Little consolation: Occidental College running back Gary Little is out for the 
season with a broken leg suffered during the Tigers' preseason scrimmage at 
Santa Barbara City College. 
</P>
<P>
Little, who gained 898 yards as a freshman last season, will be in a cast for 
eight weeks and will probably redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Brian Manlangbayan filled in for Little in Occidental's 20-12 loss at 
the University of San Diego on Saturday and gained 157 yards in 28 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"We had high hopes and big expectations and he fulfilled them," Occidental 
Coach Dale Widolff said of Manlangbayan, who led San Diego El Camino High to 
the San Diego Section 2-A Division championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
If the shoe fits. . . .: A pair of bronzed football cleats will be on the line 
Saturday night when Occidental plays host to Whittier in the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference opener. 
</P>
<P>
The "trophy" is annually awarded to the winner of the game between the Tigers 
and the Poets. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the schools split two games under a SCIAC schedule that calls for 
each conference member to play another school twice. Whittier defeated 
Occidental, 26-12, at Whittier, but Occidental closed the season with a 7-0 win 
over the Poets that clinched a third consecutive conference championship for 
the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Poet Coach Don Uyeshima will have 18 of 22 starters back this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Detour: Hugo Allan Garcia of Glendale College had led from the start of the 
Moorpark Cross-Country Invitational last Friday until, with less than a mile 
remaining, he wandered 75 yards off course. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia recovered to overtake Jose Pina of Long Beach City College with 250 
meters remaining to win, timing 20 minutes 51 seconds for the four-mile course. 
Garcia's time broke the course record of 20:59 set by Glendale's Nick Lugo. 
</P>
<P>
At last year's Moorpark Invitational, Glendale's Nicole Jimenez led the women's 
race before taking a wrong turn in the last half-mile, cutting 200 meters off 
the course. She was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's men won the team title Friday with 59 points, defeating Bakersfield 
(73) and Long Beach City (99). The women, led by Jimenez's seventh-place 
finish, held off Santa Monica, 72-129.

Causing a ruckus: Glendale High football Coach Don Shoemaker intended for his 
running backs to split action in the Dynamiters' 36-13 win over Alhambra last 
Friday -- a plan that lasted until halftime, when Pathon Rucker got a little 
greedy. 
</P>
<P>
However, Shoemaker isn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, who finished with 191 yards in 25 carries -- including three touchdowns 
and two two-point conversions -- accounted for 118 of Glendale's 170 rushing 
yards in the second half. "We were trying to balance our attack," Shoemaker 
said. "But, heck, with the stuff he was doing, it didn't make any point to give 
the ball to anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Said Alhambra Coach Gil Ruedaflores: "There was only a single guy in the 
backfield. There was no secret what they were going to do. We just couldn't 
stop him."

ELIAS FOLLOWS A TOUGH ACT AT FRANKLIN

<P>
Franklin High won the City Section 3-A Division championship last season for 
the fourth time in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers also won City titles in 1983, '86 and '87 under Coach Armando 
Gonzalez, now the offensive coordinator at East Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a hell of a legacy," says Ed Elias, who replaced Gonzalez. "I hope I 
can just keep it going." 
</P>
<P>
Elias, 42, makes his debut Friday when Franklin travels to Roosevelt for its 
season opener. A UCLA graduate and a former assistant at Pasadena City and East 
L.A. colleges as well as Alhambra and Bell highs, Elias said there will not be 
a total overhaul of the offensive and defensive schemes. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are more similar than different in Armando's philosophy and my own," 
Elias said. "We might call it orange where they called it red." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents are likely to call Franklin good once again this season, even though 
the Panthers return only one starter from last season's championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Julio Moreno will start at quarterback, replacing Santiago Alvarez, the 
3-A Player of the Year who passed for more than 4,000 yards last season and is 
now running Gonzalez's offense at East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers also lost wide receiver Lamar Lovett, the state's leading receiver 
who is now at Arizona. Fabian Picon, Mark Alacantara and Mario Abarea will be 
the wideouts this season with Anthony Aguilar starting at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers' strength might be their offensive line, which is young but big. 
Brian Duran (6-foot-3, 255 pounds) is the lone senior in a group that includes 
juniors Sal Alvarez (6-3, 225), Albert Aguirre (6-3, 220), Miguel Pena (6-1, 
245) and Gilbert Lopez (5-10, 230). 
</P>
<P>
The unit is expected to spark a running game that will feature George Gomez at 
fullback and John Flores at tailback. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a Lovett or a Santiago but we might be just a little more 
balanced," Elias said. 
</P>
<P>
Linebackers Andy and Tony Aguilar, the younger brothers of two-time All-City 
selection Jose Aguilar, anchor a Panther defense that features Hector Chavez, 
Luis Rosas and Art Gamez in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at other Glendale-area City Section teams: 
</P>
<P>
Marshall (4-6): Entering his sixth season, Ken Gerard is the dean of City 
Section coaches in the Glendale area. 
</P>
<P>
And Gerard will have to call on that experience if he hopes to make his team a 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
The Barristers lost all 22 starters -- including Times All-Glendale receiver 
Miguel Osorio -- from a team that made the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a green team," Gerard said. "It's definitely a rebuilding year." 
</P>
<P>
Gerard, who had been Marshall's offensive coordinator, will switch 
responsibilities this season with Phil Duran, who had coached the defense. 
</P>
<P>
What Marshall lacks in experience it could make up for in sheer numbers. At a 
time when many schools are struggling to field teams of more than 40 players, 
the Barristers have 180 players in their football program. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard will be coaching many of the players who helped the Marshall "B" team 
finish 8-1-1 last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," Gerard said, "a lot of them could play another year of B's, 
they're so small." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall suffered a setback in preseason workouts when Jose Rodriguez, an 
all-conference quarterback for the B team last season, went down with a knee 
injury. Junior Richard Gomez and senior Alan Panduallo are battling for the 
position and both will probably see playing time. 
</P>
<P>
The nucleus of the team is likely to be a trio of players that will start both 
ways. Ricky Araujo (5-10, 170) will play tailback and defensive back. Mike 
Escodero (6-1, 200) will start at fullback and middle linebacker, and Oscar 
Bonilla (5-10, 200) will play tackle and defensive guard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best group I've ever coached attitude-wise," said Gerard, whose team 
opens Friday against 1989 3-A runner-up Garfield. "It's just a real 
wait-and-see situation." 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock (3-6): The Eagles have struggled in a Northeast League that features 
Franklin and L. A. Wilson, but third-year Coach Dennis Arnett believes this 
could be the season Eagle Rock gains a playoff bid. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can beat Franklin this year," Arnett said. "I think it's going to 
be between us and Wilson in the last game of league (play). Hopefully, that 
will be for the whole ball of wax." 
</P>
<P>
To move into contention, Eagle Rock is going to need an outstanding season from 
senior tailback Arin Dunn, who gained more than 100 yards in several games last 
season and finished with 800 yards for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to run," Arnett said, "but we're going to be a little bit more 
wide open on offense and occasionally go with a single back and several wide 
receivers." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Robert Mancilla will figure prominently in all schemes as either a 
running back or wide receiver. Juniors Frank Chavez and Ruben Estrada will also 
be wideouts and Raul Estrada will start at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Espinosa, who has a strong arm, and Paul Engel, who is more mobile than 
Espinosa, will split time at quarterback and operate behind an offensive line 
that features Robert Hadley, Pierre Upshaw, Tom Meskin and Eric Lozano. 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw and Lozano will also start on the defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock scrimmages Fairfax on Friday afternoon before opening its season 
Sept. 21 at Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo Hills (3-6): Coach Charlie Mack has 10 players back from last season's 
team and he is optimistic that the Dons will improve enough to make the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some experience at all positions but we just don't have much depth," 
said Mack, whose team opens play Friday at home against Grant. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons have a talented and experienced receiving corps in seniors Brian 
Burdette, Tim Fagan and Joe Letscher. 
</P>
<P>
The key for Verdugo Hills will be whether the offensive line can give junior 
quarterback Noel Alvarado enough time to take advantage of his receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Juniors Justin Van Fleet and Justin Jameson will start in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons' defense will be led by senior linebacker Jeff Robertson and senior 
linemen Eric McDonagh and Robert Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to need a real team defensive effort to be successful," Mack said. 
"We just don't have one monster guy that can dominate."

DOWNEY'S CIVIC CENTER TOOK LESS BY 6 YEARS, $112 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
How much did it cost to build a Civic Center in Downey, where officials started 
thinking about a new municipal edifice complex at about the same time as 
Beverly Hills did? 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing, including the furniture, cost roughly $8.5 million to $9 
million," said Assistant City Manager Lee Powell. 
</P>
<P>
There's another big difference between the two projects: Downey's was finished 
six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Powell said municipal workers and the public in the city off 88,000 in 
southeastern Los Angeles County are more than satisfied with the three-story 
building of glass, brick and steel, complete with a soaring atrium. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends where you were before," he said. "We used to have our City Hall in 
an old schoolhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the relatively low cost and quick construction of the Downey City Hall, 
"Lord knows, things didn't go perfectly smoothly," Powell said in an interview. 
But he doubted that the lessons learned would be of much use in either city. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned lots of things about building city halls, but I guess we won't be 
able to use them till we're all dead, and somebody else will have to figure it 
out all over again," he said. MATHIS CHAZANOV

WESTCHESTER MARKS 50TH YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS SAY SMALL-TOWN VALUES STILL PRESENT IN THEIR CITY

<P>
In the midst of hog farms and fields of beans and barley back in 1940, four 
developers began to build houses on a 3,000-acre tract that bordered a small 
airstrip called Mines Field. 
</P>
<P>
A real estate ad a short while later described the area as "climatically 
perfect . . . only a few minutes' drive to the beaches (and) only one-half hour 
to downtown." Two-bedroom houses, complete with garage, paved streets and 
"sewers to every lot" sold for $3,840 -- with $95 down. 
</P>
<P>
But that was then. Subdivisions bearing such names as Kentwood and Westport 
Heights have long since grown together to become the sizable community of 
Westchester, where homes generally cost $300,000 and up. The little airstrip 
has grown up too -- it's now Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
To mark its 50th anniversary, Westchester has launched a yearlong celebration 
that began last weekend with a children's parade. Titled "Growing Up in 
Westchester," Saturday's parade drew more than 500 youthful participants -- on 
decorated bicycles, on roller skates, on foot and in strollers. The 10-minute 
parade stopped traffic as it ran from Loyola Marymount University down Loyola 
Boulevard to Westchester Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents cited the parade as evidence that the small-town values of the 
1940s are alive and well in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a family community -- like a little town in the Midwest, except we 
happen to be attached to Los Angeles," said resident Karen Jacobs, whose family 
has lived in Westchester for three generations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've managed to keep a sense of community even though we're the gateway to 
one of the largest airports in the world," said Mary Lou Crockett, a member of 
the 50th anniversary committee. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go anywhere in Westchester and not see someone you know," added 
Barbara Wetcel, who said she stayed in Westchester so her son could go to 
Westport Heights Elementary, the school she attended. 
</P>
<P>
Events commemorating the golden anniversary include a Pumpkin Fest, the annual 
Jet to Jetty 5-K and 10-K race, and a Thanksgiving community worship service in 
which local churches will gather for one service. 
</P>
<P>
A silent auction and memorabilia exhibit will be held in January, and a country 
fair is scheduled for May, when another parade of collector cars, bands and 
drill teams will reverse the route of the children's parade. A movie marathon 
of 1940s films and newsreels will be presented in June. 
</P>
<P>
Artifacts and pictures of Westchester's history will be displayed in a special 
room at the Loyola Marymount University library. At the end of the celebration 
next September, a time capsule will be buried at a site yet to be chosen.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FRIDAY'S TOP GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
MUIR VS. FONTANA 
</P>
<P>
Friday at Fontana High, 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Muir High football team made a favorable impression in its 38-13 victory 
over Palmdale in its season opener last week, but so much for the easy portion 
of the team's non-league schedule. The final four games -- Fontana, L.A. 
Banning, Bishop Amat and Servite -- are the most difficult by far. The Mustangs 
could face their biggest challenge against a Fontana squad that went 14-0 en 
route to the Southern Section Division I title last season. Fontana opened with 
a 27-13 victory over Montclair. The powerful Steelers have an imposing 
offensive line that includes prep All-American tackles Robert Loya (6-foot-3, 
280 pounds) and Clay Hattabaugh (6-3, 265), who provide solid blocking for 
running backs Don Small and Hollerith Jones. The defense is led by All-Division 
I linebacker Bobby Sylvester. The Mustangs, with quarterback Sedrick Thomas, 
defensive backs Reggie Reser, Demetrice Martin and Hasan McCullough and more 
than adequate size on the line with guards Hank Curtis (6-1, 251) and Fred 
Sayegh (6-2, 263), might be the most talented team on Fontana's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
BISHOP AMAT VS. CARSON 
</P>
<P>
Friday at Long Beach Veterans Stadium, 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
When these teams met the past two seasons, the results were strikingly similar. 
Carson, a perennial L.A. City Section power, entered both games as one of the 
top-ranked teams in the nation, but lost 17-13 and 24-23. That should provide 
plenty of incentive for the Colts, who are once again ranked among the best in 
the nation in preseason polls. But Bishop Amat figures to be anything but a 
pushover. The Lancers opened the season by defeating Rubidoux, 37-7. Bishop 
Amat was led by running back Scott Fields, who rushed for 129 yards in only 
nine carries, and quarterback Zack Zertuche, who threw for three touchdowns. 
Lancer linebacker Jason Patterson, who also starts at fullback, helped hold 
Rubidoux to 80 total yards. This will be the season opener for Carson, which 
expects to have a solid defense that includes prep All-America defensive back 
Clayvand Thomas and linebackers Marcus Long (6-2, 218) and Tarriel Hopper (6-3, 
212). 
</P>
<P>
NOGALES VS. ARROYO 
</P>
<P>
Friday at Arroyo High, 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a matchup of similar offensive philosophies when these San Gabriel 
Valley teams meet in a non-league game. Both teams prefer to run the ball with 
their veer-option offenses. Nogales has dominated this series in recent seasons 
and won last year's game, 28-14. The result could be similar this time. Nogales 
(1-0) unveiled an outstanding one-two combination at running back in its 19-12 
victory over highly regarded Claremont last week. Junior Lawrence Lanham rushed 
for 128 yards and a touchdown in 14 carries and senior Tyrone Edwards, regarded 
as a major-college prospect, added 88 yards in 15 carries. The Nobles, who 
reached the Division IV semifinals for the first time last season, also have a 
big-play defense that includes linemen Shermaine Thompson and Tony Verran and 
linebacker Luis Cuevas. Arroyo (0-1) is led on offense by junior quarterback 
Keith MacLellan and lineman Chris Jacobson (6-4, 220). 
</P>
<P>
GLENDORA VS. WEST COVINA 
</P>
<P>
Friday at West Covina, 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the season, this game might not have been the most intriguing matchup, 
but a week can make a big difference. Both teams shut out their opponents in 
season openers. Glendora, which tied Ramona for the Southern Section Division 
IV title last season, stopped South Hills, 12-0. West Covina, in its first game 
under new coach Jim Wright, rolled to a surprisingly easy 32-0 victory over Don 
Lugo. West Covina, which appeared considerably stronger than last year's team 
that struggled to a 2-7-1 record, relied mostly on its defense that recorded 
two safeties and limited Don Lugo to 46 total yards. It was business as usual 
for Glendora, which had one of the top defenses in the valley last season and 
held South Hills to 114 total yards. Glendora is led on offense by running back 
Bill Zernickow and West Covina by quarterback Gary Nesbitt. MITCH POLIN

AQMD CITES L.A. FOR LOPEZ CANYON EMISSIONS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE LANDFILL EXCEEDED STATE AIR POLLUTION LIMITS 28 TIMES. THE 
CITY FACES $700,000 IN FINES, BUT A LESSER SETTLEMENT IS BEING NEGOTIATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Regional air quality officials have cited the city of Los Angeles for violating 
state air pollution laws at Lopez Canyon Landfill in the northeastern San 
Fernando Valley on 28 separate occasions, exposing the city to fines of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, city officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The violations carry fines of up to $25,000 a day, or a total of $700,000, but 
a lesser settlement is being negotiated and should be announced by Friday, 
Deputy City Atty. Christopher Westhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District enforcement staff cited the 
city Sept. 7 for exceeding the amount of methane gas emissions allowed under 
state law at the dump 28 times from April through July. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday. A spokeswoman for 
Diana Love, the district's chief prosecutor, said AQMD attorneys had been 
meeting all day to work out details of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Westhoff said the agreement also would cover steps that the city Bureau of 
Sanitation, which operates the dump, will take to control future emissions at 
the facility near Lake View Terrace. City officials have acknowledged, in 
hearings now being conducted by the AQMD hearing board, that a newly installed 
gas collection system, built at a cost of almost $4 million, is not working. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be coming back to the board with a modified order of abatement to 
rectify all problems," Westhoff said. "The city is not reluctant to deal with 
the problem." 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD citation was issued as a result of the hearings, which have been held 
periodically since April. At that time, residents who live near the dump and 
elected officials who represent the area asked the hearing board to close the 
landfill until gas emissions could be controlled. 
</P>
<P>
According to the city's own records, as recently as July, gas emissions at 
several points in the landfill were measured at 10,000 parts per million of 
air, 20 times the level permitted by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Kagel Canyon resident Rob Zapple, who has led the fight against the landfill, 
said the citation confirmed "the community's worst fears" about excess gas 
emissions at the dump and represents a "substantial victory for the community. 
We're very happy that the AQMD's enforcement staff has finally acted." 
</P>
<P>
Zapple said he disagrees with the proposal that the city pay a lesser fine. 
</P>
<P>
"That money could be used for monitoring gas emissions at the landfill on a 
daily basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Westhoff said the violations listed in the citation were technical. Sanitation 
officials had not repaired cracks in the landfill from which gas was escaping 
within 24 hours as required by state law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That has since been corrected, Westhoff said. "What we needed to do was tighten 
up our own procedures," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Westhoff said the city also will agree to pay fines for past violations, 
including penalties for illegal excavation work during installation of the gas 
recovery system. During that work in March, 1989, a city worker was 
hospitalized after he was overcome by the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't intend to excavate but we did," Westhoff said. "We didn't have a 
permit, so we agreed to pay a fine." 
</P>
<P>
City officials have maintained throughout the hearings that they are in 
"substantial compliance" with the law.

LAID OFF AEROSPACE WORKERS TO GET AID; 
</P>
<P>
JOBS: A WAR CHEST OF $10 MILLION IS BEING ASSEMBLED TO RETRAIN THEM. STATE 
GRANT FUNDS WILL FINANCE THE PROGRAM. 
</P>

<P>
A war chest of nearly $10 million in state grant funds is being assembled to 
retrain hundreds of workers hit by aerospace industry layoffs locally, a Los 
Angeles City Council panel was told Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert Farrell, chairman of the Community and Economic Development 
Committee and a lawmaker who has been prodding the city to gird itself for a 
defense spending wind-down, called the grants a "very encouraging sign of our 
increased capacity to meet the needs of displaced aerospace workers." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles area grant money, apparently the first of its kind to target 
the aerospace layoff situation, would be used to retrain people for work at 
McDonnell Douglas' Long Beach assembly plant and at other unspecified 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The $10 million in retraining money -- which may be supplemented by another 
$3-million grant to retool the skills of 1,000 defense industry workers for 
jobs at PacTel Cellular, the nation's second largest car phone company -- comes 
from the state's unemployment insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago the council adopted a preliminary plan to cope with aerospace 
industry layoffs, including a commitment to seek $28 million in U.S. Department 
of Labor grants for job retraining and a move to clear away a thicket of 
cumbersome rules that slow the city's ability to apply for federal funds to 
help retrain, counsel and possibly relocate displaced workers. 
</P>
<P>
The move to build a regional safety net for aerospace workers comes as some 
labor analysts have predicted that up to 20,000 Southland defense industry 
employees will be laid off by the end of the year. About 60% of the state's 
huge aerospace industry work force is located in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The $10 million is in two grants, each for $5 million, from the state 
Employment Training Panel. Only 75% of one of the grant's, or $3.75 million, 
must be spent to help aerospace industry layoff victims. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is a seven-member body created in 1983 to administer grant funds 
disbursed from a 0.1% annual allocation from the state's unemployment insurance 
fund. The so-called ETP grants are to be used to retrain workers who are about 
to be laid off, or who have been laid off, said Ada Carrillo, the panel's 
manager for planning and information. 
</P>
<P>
The grants only pay retraining costs, not for any stipends or wages to 
trainee-workers, Carrillo said. The retraining agencies, which in many cases 
are companies who are tapping the jobless market for new employees, do not get 
reimbursed for their training costs unless they hire the workers for at least 
90 days. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the new Southland grants will go to the United Auto Workers-Labor 
Employment and Training Corp., a organization established to retrain displaced 
workers. Bob Nelson, a vice president at UAW-LETC, said the nonprofit affiliate 
of the auto workers union will begin classes at its South Gate facility Oct. 1 
to retrain up to 1,200 laid off aerospace industry workers for jobs as 
structural mechanics and electronic assemblers at McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell makes its MD-80 and MD-11 commercial jets at its Long Beach site. 
</P>
<P>
The classes will be offered for 18 months. Individual classes will run for six 
or nine weeks, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The other grant is set aside exclusively for use in retraining Lockheed workers 
laid off at the company's Burbank plant and is being administered locally by 
the Verdugo Private Industry Council, a private nonprofit corporation serving 
Glendale and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Details have not been worked out about which companies or community colleges 
would operate the retraining programs, said Madalyn Blake, the Verdugo PIC's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
But Blake said the idea is to market the training program to production and 
some high-tech companies working between Burbank and Palmdale, a corridor where 
a majority of Lockheed employees live.

CLEAN UP ACT, L.A. ZOO TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMALS: U.S. CITES LONGSTANDING FOOD AND SANITATION PROBLEMS. THE FACILITY 
COULD FACE FINES OR REVOCATION OF ITS LICENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated by repeated violations of the Animal Welfare Act, federal officials 
have formally warned the Los Angeles Zoo to correct longstanding problems at 
the Griffith Park facility or face legal action that could bring stiff fines or 
license revocation. 
</P>
<P>
Problems found by U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors over the last three 
years include inappropriate food storage that could lead to contamination, 
sanitation deficiencies that could promote disease, pest and rodent 
contamination, inadequate housing and run-down animal barns. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, for example, an inspector noted that a refrigerator used to 
store food for polar bears had standing pools of polluted liquid that appeared 
to be blood. 
</P>
<P>
A medicine shelf contained bloody cardboard and paper towels, and a used 
hypodermic syringe was lying in the food preparation area for the polar bears. 
Fecal coloform levels were checked only sporadically in the bears' swimming 
moat. 
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials said they have corrected many of the problems in recent weeks and 
have plans to address the others. Agriculture Department officials acknowledge 
that there has been significant improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, records show, the zoo repeatedly missed correction 
deadlines set by the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
USDA officials said that Zoo director Warren Thomas failed to respond to a 
letter they sent him nearly a year ago demanding an immediate response to a 
list of 10 chronic violations. 
</P>
<P>
"We explained that there were some very significant problems," said William R. 
DeHaven, the USDA's supervisor of animal care for the western United States. 
"There was enough there for me to initiate some legal action." 
</P>
<P>
In the year since that letter, "things went from bad to worse" and the USDA 
began a formal investigation of the zoo, DeHaven said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Humane Society of the United States has written a 
scathing letter to the Agriculture Department complaining of a "shameful record 
of non-compliance" at the zoo. The society criticized the zoo for "inadequate 
exhibits" that are "deplorably barren and sadly outdated." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, Thomas rejected the Humane Society's criticism, 
saying: "Who the hell are they? . . . They're just people off the street." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he does not recall receiving the USDA letter and blamed 
middle-level employees for failing to inform him of the repeated USDA 
citations. He said he started a crash program last month to address the federal 
violations and, for the moment, has headed off legal action. 
</P>
<P>
Other problems cited by the USDA: 
</P>
<P>
* Gorilla housing had inadequate ventilation, as well as peeling paint and 
cracked and chipped concrete. Inspectors first noted the problem in 1987 and 
warned that the surfaces had to be repaired to allow proper cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
* A number of animal barns had peeling paint that could fall and be ingested by 
the animals. 
</P>
<P>
* Barn doors throughout the zoo had jagged, splintered or rotting edges that 
could injure animals. Though the problem was first noted in 1987, some barn 
doors still have not been repaired or replaced. 
</P>
<P>
* Drainage problems and standing pools of water and urine were found in and 
around animal enclosures. On Aug. 22, 1989, inspectors noted that runoff from 
thawing fish had contaminated the polar bear enclosure. Nearly a year later, 
the situation had not been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
* Toxic substances were stored in the same area as food additives and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
* Grain sheds contained open bags, spilled food, mouse feces and dead mice, a 
situation that inspectors said could lead to the spread of disease. 
</P>
<P>
In a warning letter to Thomas this week, DeHaven set deadlines of Sept. 30 and 
Nov. 15 for completion of some repairs, but no extensions would be granted on 
other matters, including rodent, drainage and water-testing problems. 
</P>
<P>
DeHaven said that prosecution is likely if the problems continue. "We would use 
this warning (letter) to seek the maximum penalty allowed by law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA, which inspects and licenses animal exhibits, could seek penalties of 
up to $2,500 per violation or revoke the zoo's license to operate. Fines could 
be significant, DeHaven said, and probably would be calculated at $2,500 per 
day per animal. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said this week that he first became aware of the USDA citations in July. 
"As soon as I saw it, I nearly had a heart attack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the problems, he said, can be blamed on the age of the zoo, which was 
built 25 years ago. "We're playing catch-up constantly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the USDA last month, John W. Grandy, a vice president of the 
Humane Society, said the zoo's record of federal violations is "unacceptable" 
and that the animals are housed in an "irresponsible and inhumane manner." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Zoo "has a lot of barren exhibits" that do not stimulate 
animals, Grandy said. A report by Humane Society investigator Lisa Landres 
says, for instance, that the zoo's elephant areas are relegating the animals to 
"boredom and monotony." Landres is a former elephant keeper who left the San 
Diego Zoo after a controversy in which she objected to the beating of an 
elephant. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Greuel, Mayor Tom Bradley's liaison to the Department of Recreation and 
Parks, said Wednesday that no one outside the zoo had been made aware of the 
problems and that the mayor's office planned to ask for a complete report on 
the progress of corrective actions. 
</P>
<P>
Greuel said that recreation and parks commissioners, who oversee the zoo, "are 
jumping on this immediately because they are concerned."

RAIDERS IN HAND, BRADLEY SEEKS SOCCER'S WORLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley said Wednesday, the day after the Raiders agreed to keep 
playing football in Los Angeles, that the city's next top sports priority is to 
secure the finals of the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, in a telephone interview from London, also revealed that he gave 
Raiders team owner Al Davis his personal guarantee at a key stage of the 
negotiations that he and other city authorities will do everything they can to 
expedite an environmental impact review, thus clearing the way for the promised 
$145-million Los Angeles Coliseum renovation that is the key element in the 
Raiders deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Friday, we brought the two parties, Davis and Spectacor (the Coliseum's 
private managers) together," Bradley said. "There were some minor questions 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the end of the meeting Davis stayed behind and he said to me: 'I want 
to hear it from you. Is this thing going to work? Is the EIR (environmental 
impact report) something you think we can do? Will we have the support of you 
and the city?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Absolutely,' " the mayor recounted. "He said, 'That's the bottom 
line.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who is in London promoting Los Angeles tourism, said he plans to play 
a very active role in the bid process for the World Cup, soccer's premier 
event, observing: "We're in the hunt now, and it's a question of whether we 
will be able to put together a good bid for the final. We want it, we deserve 
it, and I know that we can do it. 
</P>
<P>
World Cup organizing officials warmly welcomed Bradley's commitment. One 
official said Los Angeles has "been lagging behind" four Florida bidders in a 
competition that is to culminate with a selection made by the international 
soccer federation at the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of Tuesday's dramatic announcement that the Raiders are 
staying in the city, there were these other developments: 
</P>
<P>
* Los Angeles Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley opened the way for both the Raiders 
and USC to play in Dodger Stadium during the remodeling of the Coliseum. This 
could be in the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley said in a statement: "Neither USC nor the Raiders has approached us, 
but if the mayor asks us to accommodate either of those teams on a short-term 
basis, while the Coliseum is being remodeled, we would try to accommodate them, 
providing it does not disrupt the baseball season." 
</P>
<P>
* Donald Sterling, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball franchise, 
possibly stung by a commitment in the Raiders deal to finish Coliseum 
renovations before pursuing construction of a replacement for the aging Sports 
Arena where his team plays, announced that he is looking at several new sites 
away from the Coliseum complex for a stadium in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Top officials from (the) Ogden (Corp.) and the Madison Square Garden Corp. 
will be meeting with Clipper officials this month to evaluate specific parcels 
for development," Sterling said. "In addition, the leading architectural firm 
of Ellerbe Becket will be meeting with (us) next Tuesday to discuss design 
proposals for the new arena." He said the new arena would cost $150 million, 
seat 22,000 and contain 200 luxury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
* Jay Rounds, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy, said his 
organization is ready to work with Bradley, Spectacor and the Raiders to "find 
historically sensitive ways to make the needed improvements to the Coliseum" 
and has already agreed to serve on the steering committee that is arranging a 
design workshop for December on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased that the Raiders have chosen to stay in Los Angeles," Rounds 
said. "We feel that the Coliseum, like any other historic building, needs to be 
used to be preserved." He said the design workshop, being set up by Bradley 
aides, would hear public testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, commenting on the agreement, lauded the efforts of his deputy, Mark 
Fabiani, and one of his Coliseum Commission appointees, labor leader William R. 
Robertson, in expediting resolution of issues between the Raiders and Spectacor 
and remarked that "perseverance" was the key element in finally landing the 
Raiders for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
As regards Davis, Bradley remarked: "There was good electricity that flowed 
between the two of us from the first time I met him. I've never had a 
difference with Al Davis. Well, maybe one. The only time we differed was that 
day he accepted Oakland (last March)." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's vow of an all-out bid for the World Cup finals comes at a time when a 
combined Coliseum-Rose Bowl bid for World Cup games is just getting under way. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the World Cup organizing committee said Wednesday that about 
two dozen cities appear to be in the competition and that initial 
recommendations of between eight and 12 sites for games will be made to the 
international soccer federation, known as FIFA, in the spring of 1991. He said 
FIFA might choose sites in June, 1991, but probably would not allocate games, 
including a site for the semifinals and final, until the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Alan Rothenberg, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, 
who is expected next week to be named chairman of the World Cup Organizing 
Committee, said Wednesday that Bradley's statement was "music to my ears. . . . 
If that is the highest priority of the mayor, then I'm sure he'll see that the 
considerations we require would be met," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Scott Letellier, executive director of the organizing committee, said 
that "some of the Florida communities are ahead at this point in the bidding 
process." He noted that the state of Florida has already committed more than $1 
million in public funds in bid deposits.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: A SHORTER WORKWEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county Public Works Department has begun a "4/40" workweek for 47% of its 
3,400 full-time employees based in Alhambra. The move, which is designed to cut 
air pollution and traffic congestion, is expected to save about 77,000 gallons 
of gasoline and keep 27 tons of pollutants per year out of the air by reducing 
employee work trips by 20%, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, which began Monday, about 1,600 county employees will work 
10 hours a day, Monday through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
This brings to 3,200 the number of county employes working a "4/40 schedule. 
This program is expected to save taxpayers an estimated $1.7 million annually 
by reducing the number of sick days and reducing building operating costs, 
since the the building will be closed on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some other facts about county work habits, taken from a July survey: 
</P>
<P>
* Los Angeles County employs 75,000 people full time. 
</P>
<P>
* It has 3,000 employees working a "9/80" schedule, which means an 80-hour-work 
period spread over nine days. 
</P>
<P>
700 telecommuters work part-time at home. 
</P>
<P>
16,000 employees have flexible starting times. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, employees of the cities of Azusa, Carson, Duarte and Hermosa also 
have four-day workweeks.

PLEA BARGAIN IN MOLESTATION CASE REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge refused Wednesday to sentence a former schoolteacher who pleaded guilty 
to molesting four students, saying he finds the plea bargain agreed to by both 
sides inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Don Ray Moore had pleaded guilty in exchange for a reduced prison sentence of 
12 years. However, when the moment of sentencing arrived, Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge Michael R. Hoff said, "Based on the probation report, I find I 
cannot endorse the case settlement." 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared to guide Hoff in sentencing, contains statements made by 
alleged victims of the veteran fifth-grade teacher, who lived in the South Bay 
area and taught in South-Central Los Angeles during most of his 20-year career. 
</P>
<P>
The judge sent the case back to a Municipal Court for a preliminary hearing 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old Moore, who taught for 16 years at the 97th Street School, 
jumped bail shortly after his arrest three years ago, living as a transient and 
losing contact with his wife, children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
He was captured in July in a Ventura County homeless camp after authorities 
received a tip from a gas company employee. The worker had seen the well-spoken 
man he remembered meeting near the Hobo Jungle riverbed camp on a segment of 
the television program "America's Most Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Under last month's plea bargain arrangement, Moore admitted guilt on four 
felony counts of child molestation involving young girls. The proposed 12-year 
sentence would have made him eligible for release in six years. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors agreed to drop 17 additional counts as well as dozens of 
misdemeanor counts, which could have put him behind bars for the rest of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's attorney, Deputy Public Defender John Powers, said his client now wants 
to withdraw his guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty minutes after he entered his plea, he told me, 'I've made a terrible 
mistake,' " Powers said. "He initially felt it was a compromise to save 
everyone the trauma. . . . But after further consideration, he decided he would 
rather spend the rest of his life in prison than admit to something he didn't 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing jail blues and appearing confident, Moore boomed, "I certainly do," 
when asked whether he agreed to the rescheduled proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's hearing, Municipal Judge Elva R. Soper could reject Moore's plea 
withdrawal request and send the case to another Superior Court judge for 
imposition of the sentence, or resume proceedings against him on all 21 felony 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ryan Rainey said that the victims, now 18 to 20 years old, 
at first voiced relief when Moore pleaded guilty, because it meant that they 
would not have to go through the ordeal of testifying. But they became upset at 
learning that he had negotiated a light sentence, saying they believe their 
alleged assailant "should be locked away forever." 
</P>
<P>
Rainey said the young women now want to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is accused of lewd and lascivious acts with children under 14 between 
1981 and 1984.

WASHED-OUT HIGHWAY MAY BE WASHED UP; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: OFFICIALS WANT TO PERMANENTLY CLOSE STRETCH OF CALIFORNIA 39 
NEAR CRYSTAL LAKE THAT HAS BEEN BLOCKED BY BOULDERS SINCE 1978. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For years, northbound travelers on California 39 winding into the heart of the 
Angeles National Forest have been stopped abruptly by boulders blocking the 
road near Crystal Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Since a 1978 rainstorm washed out 500 feet of asphalt and tossed rocks onto the 
highway, a 4.4-mile stretch of roadway has been closed. In the meantime, state 
transportation officials have been unwilling to spend the estimated $20 million 
needed to reopen the San Gabriel Valley's central link to the forest and the 
Angeles Crest Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Now Caltrans and U.S. Forest Service officials want to make the road closing 
official, taking the unprecedented step of abandoning a part of California 39. 
</P>
<P>
The mile-high section of road with its breathtaking chaparral views 8 1/2 miles 
north of Azusa would be given over forever to hikers, mountain bikers and the 
forest's estimated 700 big horn sheep. 
</P>
<P>
Other state roads have been closed temporarily before, but they have always 
been repaired and reopened at some point, said Wallace J. Rothbart, chief of 
Caltrans' project studies branch for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, as he 
led a tour of the road Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Even the closing won't be cheap: officials estimate that it will cost several 
million dollars to remove barriers and shore up the road so it doesn't crumble 
into adjacent Bear Creek Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Although California 39, finished in 1961, once provided easy access to ski 
resorts at Mt. Waterman and Kratka Ridge and was a scenic route to Wrightwood, 
Caltrans officials say they have heard no complaints about the closing. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no pressure one way or the other from environmental groups or 
business interests to reopen the road," said Don Stikkers, district ranger of 
the Forest Service's Mt. Baldy District. "We just feel it . . . needs to get 
resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans will hold a hearing on the closure next Thursday from 4 to 8 p.m. at 
the Glendora Library. 
</P>
<P>
Stikkers said considerations include how a permanent closure would affect deer, 
bear, the big horn sheep whose migratory path includes the roadway and even 
trout that swim in Bear Creek Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Caltrans has maintained culverts along the closed part and even cleared 
small rockslides. "It always has been a maintenance headache," Rothbart said.

SUSPECT IN STABBING CASE KNIFED AT COURT; VICTIM HELD; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: JUST BEFORE HIS TRIAL IS TO START IN PASADENA, THE DEFENDANT IS 
ATTACKED IN AN ELEVATOR, ALLEGEDLY BY THE MAN HE IS ACCUSED OF KNIFING IN A 
BARROOM BRAWL. 
</P>

<P>
Just minutes before his trial was to start, a defendant accused of stabbing 
another man during a barroom brawl was knifed himself Wednesday -- allegedly by 
his victim -- as both men shared an elevator in the Pasadena Courthouse, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Allie Braverman, 40, was hospitalized in stable condition with at least five 
serious puncture wounds in the back and torso following the bizarre 10:30 a.m. 
confrontation, which started after he stepped into an elevator to ride the six 
floors up to the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
The only other person on the elevator was Joseph Hernandez, according to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hernandez whom Braverman had allegedly stabbed half a dozen times a year 
ago during a fight at a Rosemead bar, leading to Braverman's arrest on charges 
of attempted murder. Opening statements in his trial had been set for Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how the two men wound up on the elevator together. "That's the 
amazing thing here," said one Pasadena police investigator who did not want to 
be identified, "and we still don't have an answer to that one. We're trying to 
find out." 
</P>
<P>
What is known is that Braverman, bleeding profusely, staggered out of the 
elevator on the courthouse's top floor and into a courtroom -- Department G -- 
about 20 yards away. His dramatic entrance interrupted a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"He just walked in and stood there and said he had been knifed," said William 
Surray, a defendant in another case who had been waiting in the courtroom. 
"When he first walked in, there was blood all over his shirt, and as he stood 
there, the blood kept dripping from everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large crowd of sheriff's deputies, Pasadena police and other law 
enforcement officers who happened to be in the sixth-floor lobby watched in 
amazement. 
</P>
<P>
"The elevator door opens, and here you've got this crime scene," said Pasadena 
Police Lt. Roger Kelley. "It sounds like some kind of retribution or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Braverman lurched out of the elevator, Hernandez walked out, too, 
and was quickly taken into custody by officers and booked in county jail on 
suspicion of attempted murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was blood-soaked," the Kelley said of Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
A district attorney's investigator reported having seen Hernandez emerge from 
the elevator carrying what appeared to be a six-inch kitchen boning knife and 
trying to hide it in an ashtray, Sheriff's Sgt. Jim Rankin said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a 1 1/2-inch blade left, and they found two pieces of the blade in 
the elevator," Rankin said. 
</P>
<P>
The scene's aftermath was witnessed by several jurors in the upcoming trial, as 
they arrived at court to see Braverman being wheeled out and noticed the 
bloodstains in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Judge Charles Lee polled each of the jurors to determine whether 
they could still hear the case without prejudice. Convinced they could not, 
prosecutors quickly moved for a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Thomas Nishi opposed the move, arguing that it would make 
it difficult to get witnesses for a future trial because they would feel 
intimidated by Hernandez. Lee is to rule on the mistrial motion today. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Nishi said he had planned Wednesday to ask the judge to restrain 
Hernandez because of an alleged history of violence. The attorney claimed that 
Hernandez and some friends had beaten up people at the courtroom during an 
earlier preliminary hearing in the case because they mistakenly thought them to 
be Braverman's friends. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena courthouse -- like all but the downtown Criminal Courts Building 
and the Compton site in the county system -- does not have permanent metal 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
A court security commission in the summer of 1988, spurred by incidents such as 
the shooting that year of a Van Nuys bailiff by a disgruntled man, recommended 
that all the criminal courts get the $54,000 detectors, but that proposal has 
been slowed by staffing and funding problems, said John Steele, a court 
consultant on security. Wednesday's stabbing could speed that process, and "add 
an urgency" to the issue, he said.

HEAT TIED IN SECOND OVERTIME;

<P>
SOCCER: SAN FRANCISCO USES SMALLER FIELD TO ITS ADVANTAGE IN APSL CHAMPIONSHIP 
GAME.

<P>
The Los Angeles Heat, which struggled on narrow field all year, couldn't get 
its offense untracked Wednesday night in tiny Spartan Stadium and went into a 
second overtime tied, 1-1, with the San Francicso Bay Blackhawks in the 
American Professional Soccer League West championship game. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the first 15-minute overtime period, the Heat seemed to be 
regrouping and was attacking the San Francisco goal more as it did at the start 
the game. However, most of the attacks were coming from the middle of the field 
and proved ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, which held a one-game lead in the home-and-home series, came from 
behind in the second half of regulation play to send the game into two 
15-minute overtime periods, a standard used internationally to decide 
championship contests. If there is no score in the extra periods, the first 
game would come down to penalty kicks. A San Francisco victory would force 
another 30-minute mini-game to decide the league champion. The mini-game would 
also be decided by penalty kicks if it ended in a tie. 
</P>
<P>
The winner advances to Boston for the APSL's national championship game Sept. 
22. The opponent will be the Maryland Bays, champions of the APSL East. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday at Veterans Satdium in Long Beach, a field that offered more than 
70 yards of width and large areas behind the touch lines, the Heat dominated 
San Francisco, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the case Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Although Los Angeles came out firing, getting off three shots in the first 2 
1/2 minutes, it was the Blackhawks who controlled most of the regulation game. 
Spartan Stadium is only 65 yards wide, and that seemed to affect the Heat, 
which played much of its game down the middle of the field. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks got an unassisted goal from National Team member Eric Wynalda in 
the 37th minute, a rifle shot from the left side of the 18-yard mark. The hard 
shot sailed past Heat goalie Mike Littman and pounded into the back of the net, 
bringing the crowd of 3,800 to its feet. It was the first playoff goal for 
Wynalda and only his third of the year in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Although Los Angeles outshot San Francisco in the first half, 7-4, it seemed to 
be in a malaise after Wynalda's shot. 
</P>
<P>
But the Heat even when forward Waldir Guerra, who earlier reinjured his right 
ankle, tapped a loose ball off a corner kick past San Francisco goalkeeper Mark 
Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
It was a physical game. In the first half there were numerous shoving matches. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Sacks of the Heat got a yellow card for a hard tackle from behind only 
eight minutes into the game. Five yellow cards were issued in regulation and 26 
fouls were called.

PREP COLUMN: TWO-WEEK LAYOFF IS OK WITH SERRA COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most football coaches would dread having a two-week layoff at this point in the 
season, when game experience is crucial for building consistency. 
</P>
<P>
Serra High Coach Leo Hand, though, says he doesn't mind that the Cavaliers' 
next game isn't until Sept. 28, when they visit St. Paul of Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any problems with it," he said. "It gives us an opportunity to 
heal up and work on some of our mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Serra was left without a game this week because of a scheduling mistake by 
Centennial. The schools had a contract to play Friday night at Centennial, but 
when the Ocean and Pioneer leagues cross-scheduled their non-league games last 
year, Centennial arranged a game with Rolling Hills on the same night. 
</P>
<P>
Hand said Serra, which also has a bye next week, discovered the error last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We were kind of shocked," he said. "(Centennial) changed their athletic 
director and football coach last year, and somebody didn't check it out. They 
apologized. They knew they had made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Because Centennial was at fault, Serra suggested that it be allowed to play 
Rolling Hills. But the schools couldn't agree on a time and place to play, so 
Serra bowed out and Rolling Hills will play Friday night at Centennial. 
</P>
<P>
Hand said he was against playing at Rolling Hills in the afternoon because of 
the heat, and Rolling Hills was not willing to play Serra at night. Rolling 
Hills' field does not have lights. 
</P>
<P>
"We said we'd play them any night at any place," Hand said. "But I don't think 
it makes much sense to play in the daytime at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
"They preferred not to play us, and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Two of Serra's starting running backs were injured last week in a 38-0 win over 
Pasadena. Halfback Tim Trahan suffered a hairline fracture of the leg and 
fullback Corey Jones bruised his knee. 
</P>
<P>
Hand, however, expects both players to be ready to play against St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
As for his team's performance last week against Pasadena, Hand said he was 
disappointed despite the lopsided win. Pasadena made things easy for Serra by 
losing six of seven fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
"We played very poorly, but you really couldn't tell by the score," Hand said. 
"We got a lot of opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
The coach said part of the problem is that Serra has two many players going 
both ways. That will have to change, he said, if the Cavaliers want to compete 
against St. Paul, which carries close to 70 players. 
</P>
<P>
Serra has a roster of about 30 players. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to sacrifice in certain instances to have fresher bodies," Hand said. 
"If we don't, we're going to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills football Coach Gary Kimbrell was disappointed with more than his 
team's performance last week in a 28-9 loss to Mary Star. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't much of a team," he said. "We had guys talking in the huddle and 
finger-pointing, things that hadn't gone on before. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coaching for a long time, and I'm beyond being embarrassed by a 
defeat. But the attitude of the kids on the field is what was disappointing to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrell expects a better attitude against Centennial, and a bigger night from 
All-CIF running back Robert Coulter, held to 36 yards on 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have some good kids and we will improve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance, which averaged 140 yards rushing a game last season, gained 276 
yards on the ground last week in a 30-16 win over Verbum Dei. Included in the 
total was 216 yards by Alex Schultz, a 6-foot-2, 215-pound fullback. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be very, very good," said West Co-Coach Mark Knox. 
</P>
<P>
Another key, Knox said, was the play of the offensive line, anchored by tackles 
Scott Werner (6-2, 260) and Josh Gormley (6-5, 260). Werner is back after 
missing most of last season with a stress fracture in his foot. Gormley is a 
transfer from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, Werner, Gormley and free safety Jason Orpe, a junior who had an 
interception, all received game balls. 
</P>
<P>
West will play host Friday night to Mira Costa, which played El Segundo to a 
scoreless tie last week. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see the pieces are all there offensively," Knox said of Mira Costa. 
"They just didn't get it together. But their defense is very good." 
</P>
<P>
Four Carson football players who were suspended from school last spring, 
including All-American defensive back Clayvand Thomas, have been readmitted 
after a review by the administration. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Gene Vollnogle, though, said he doesn't expect Thomas to play until the 
middle of October. The senior is still recovering from a broken kneecap 
suffered in a car accident in March. 
</P>
<P>
"He started running Monday, but he wasn't able to get a mile in without 
stopping," Vollnogle said. "It's a month-by-month situation." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle said one of the reinstated players, Fiti Gagau, will play a key role 
in the Colts' opener Friday night against Bishop Amat at Veterans Stadium in 
Long Beach. The 5-11, 185-pound junior plays defensive tackle and outside 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"He raises hell on defense," Vollnogle said. "He's so damn quick." 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay Girls Basketball Club, founded by Palos Verdes High Coach Wendell 
Yoshida, will meet for the first time at 4 p.m. Saturday at Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
The club, open to players 13 and under, offers a fundamentals clinic, from 
which all-star traveling teams will be formed to compete in Amateur Athletic 
Union-sanctioned tournaments. Yoshida, one of the South Bay's most successful 
prep coaches, will serve as club president. 
</P>
<P>
Fees are $36 per player for the first month and $30 each month thereafter. The 
club will meet from 4-6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact Yoshida at 318-5491. 
</P>

a big game for the Stars. . . . North Torrance quarterback Brian Jurado, the 
area's leading passer last season, was held to 45 yards passing in a 14-11 win 
over San Clemente. Jurado did better on the ground, rushing for 60 yards and a 
one-yard TD. . . . Joe McEwen, a junior running back for Bishop Montgomery, had 
112 yards on six carries and scored on a 72-yard run in a 25-15 losing effort

BANNING HIRES PAEZ AS BASKETBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three months after he resigned as a coach and teacher with the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, former Cleveland High basketball Coach Marc Paez is 
back doing both -- at Banning High. 
</P>
<P>
Paez, 30, who left Cleveland in June after guiding the Cavaliers to a 21-6 
record and into the City Section 4-A Division semifinals in his only season as 
coach, was hired last week. 
</P>
<P>
Paez, who cited external distractions and the pressure to win at the Reseda 
school as a prime reason for resigning, said he does not expect to encounter 
similar problems at Banning. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, time will tell, but I suspect that it'll be closer to what I hope 
to find at the high school level," said Paez, a former assistant coach at St. 
Bernard. "I anticipate less off-the-court distractions. It should be closer to 
what I think high school basketball is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Paez replaces Gary Cain, who coached the Pilots for four seasons. A Banning 
administrator said Cain was forced to resign by the district in order to devote 
more time to his job as a counselor in the dropout prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
Paez said he had turned down several offers -- including professional coaching 
positions in Ireland and Turkey -- before Banning Principal Augie Herrera 
called him last month. 
</P>
<P>
Banning contacted him at the recommendation of City Section Commissioner Hal 
Harkness. Herrera had contacted Harkness to discuss possible candidates for the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I know about him and from the endorsements from (Cleveland Principal 
Ida Mae Windham), I thought that if somebody of his caliber and character was 
available, we should try to keep him around," Harkness said. 
</P>
<P>
Paez said he welcomes the job of building a program that has struggled. 
Banning, a perennial City power in football, has fielded .500 basketball teams 
in recent years. The Pilots were 11-13 last season.

The following are capsule reviews of some of the better restaurants recently 
visited by our critics: 
</P>
<P>
The Sportsman Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge is a throwback to the 1950s and 
'60s when it was one of the "special occasion" restaurants in Ventura. Although 
its prices might have changed with the times, the quality of its steaks and 
chops has not. The Sportsman is at 50 S. California St., Ventura, 643-2851. 
Open 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Monday-Friday, 11 a.m.-11 p.m. Saturday, 9 a.m.-2 p.m. for 
breakfast and lunch on Sunday, 5 p.m.-10 p.m. for dinner. Lunch for two, food 
only, $12-$20. Dinner for two, food only, $25-$46. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of Jag's India House call their Northern Indian cooking "royal Mogul 
cuisine." The hot fresh breads alone are worth the trip to the restaurant. 
There are dozens of versions of curries, from a fabulous shrimp masala to a 
lamb rogan josh. Jag's India House, 860 Hampshire, Suite U, Westlake Village, 
(805) 373-6266. Lunch 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Tuesday-Friday; dinner 5:30-10 
p.m. Tuesday-Sunday. Wine and Beer. Parking lot. MasterCard and Visa. Dinner 
for two, food only, $30-$50. 
</P>
<P>
MK's is hot and cold. Hot in that it's frequently packed, cool as an oasis on a 
summer afternoon. Some dishes are very, very good, notably the seafood Vera 
Cruz and the "grazing platter" of grilled vegetables, grains, soft cheese, 
chutney and salsa. The bread is great, and when it is dessert time you'll go 
far before finding a better apricot cobbler. MK's is at 139 Ojai Ave., Ojai, 
640-8001. Breakfast 8-11 a.m. Monday, Wednesday-Friday; until noon 
Saturday-Sunday. Lunch 11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday-Friday; noon-2:30 
p.m. Saturday-Sunday. Dinner 5-10 p.m. Wednesday-Monday. Meal for two, food 
only, $26-$58. 
</P>
<P>
Downey's is expensive, and sometimes it's worth it. The duck, no matter how 
prepared, is excellent. Add some of Downey's outstanding appetizers, such as 
the grilled squab, and flawless desserts, the Belgian chocolate marquis, for 
example, and you'll avoid the pitfalls -- overcooked fish and undistinguished 
beef and lamb dishes. Downey's is at 1305 State St., Santa Barbara, (805) 
966-5006. Dinner Tuesday to Sunday from 5:3O p.m. Dinner for two, food only, 
$65 to $80.

Heavy metal. What is it? Not a Chrysler or a Lincoln, we're talking music here. 
</P>
<P>
Is heavy metal just the teen-agers' way of giving parents gray hair (and 
scaring the cat)? Is it merely the soundtrack for D students with active glands 
who drive fast, party hard and have the warrants to prove it? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Deep Purple's "Machine Head" album from the early '70s was the first 
full-on heavy metal album, perhaps not. In any case, not long after that, 
critics started predicting the end of metal. Wrong again. Not only has metal 
not gone away, it's bigger than ever. Metal has its own magazines dedicated to 
the deification of the decibel, and even all-metal radio stations where nary an 
R.E.M. cut is heard. 
</P>
<P>
There's more to metal than just loudness. There's all that hair, all that 
mousse, all that black leather, all that screaming and different types of metal 
-- speed metal, thrash metal, gore metal, death metal, glam metal, corporate 
metal, and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Megadeth, the L.A. quartet who will play the Ventura Theatre 
tonight along with Excel. Megadeth, known as "the thinking man's metal band," 
has released four albums since 1985 with titles such as "Killing Is My Business 
. . . And Business Is Good," "so far, so good . . . so what!" and "Peace Sells 
. . . But Who's Buying?" The new one is "Rust In Peace." 
</P>
<P>
While most metal bands deal with hedonistic issues where fun is never a 
four-letter word, Megadeth instead deals with larger issues such as hate, 
death, war and understanding. It's a different type of metal band, and lead 
singer Dave Mustaine -- the Megadude -- is very different, and certainly not 
stuck for an answer when asked anything: 
</P>
<P>
What about the current tour? 
</P>
<P>
This will be our first tour since May, 1988. We'll be playing several dates 
around California before we get to Ventura. The 13th is my birthday, by the way 
-- I'll be 29, gettin' up there. After that, we'll be going to Europe for our 
Clash of the Titans tour along with Judas Priest, Testament and Suicidal 
Tendencies. Then we'll return to the states and do an arena tour with Judas 
Priest. 
</P>
<P>
You guys have recorded four albums that receive little airplay yet still the 
band seems to be doing fine. Explain. 
</P>
<P>
Well, we don't conform to anything. . . . We're not like those glam bands who 
make music so the girls will like us. We don't believe in that image stuff; we 
just get in, play hard and get out, without mascara. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a basic Megadeth fan and is it the stereotypical metal head? 
</P>
<P>
No, our fans are actually well versed in current events. They may have several 
Megadeth T-shirts in the closets, and they're probably shunned by their peers 
and they probably won't be reading The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Your band has gone through members like the lunch shift at McDonald's, why? 
</P>
<P>
Musical differences and definite personality clashes, the usual stuff. And one 
unnamed member decided he wanted to share my girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
How did Megadeth get started? 
</P>
<P>
I was in Metallica, but I got kicked out because I punched the lead singer in 
the mouth. He kicked my puppy so I punched him in the mouth. Then things got 
bad. I'm not going to say I'm sorry, but if I had it to do over again, I'd keep 
my dog at home. I miss those guys. In 1983, I decided to form the ultra 
heaviest, ultra furious band around. And I think I did. 
</P>
<P>
Why do critics knock metal? 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people just don't understand the lyrics and a lot of bands don't help 
because the singer is unintelligible and fails to enunciate. There's also the 
stereotype that people who listen to metal are underachievers like Bart 
Simpson, or that they're just a bunch of longhairs that do dope. Well, I've got 
long hair, don't party and I've been to college. 
</P>
<P>
Why can't you guys spell "death"? 
</P>
<P>
It's a phonetic spelling. 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s longhairs ostensibly were into peace and love, but today longhair 
seems to have a different connotation, why? 
</P>
<P>
Most of the longhairs now are children of the longhairs then. Today, the 
population seems real angry. Everyone wants to do what their parents did, but 
the parents tell them, "I walked to school five miles through the snow," and 
all that. With all the technology today, no one has to be uncomfortable 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Metal is bigger than ever, why? 
</P>
<P>
Genuine metal is having a resurgence; I'm talking about true heavy metal, not 
the pretending bands. You know, Poison looks like Motley Crue, who looks like 
Warrant, who looks like Poison. They can't decide whether they want to look 
pretty or tough. It's like: "Make up your mind, bonehead!" 
</P>
<P>
Describe Megadeth music. 
</P>
<P>
It's P.I.G. music -- P-I-G; that's personal instant gratification. 
</P>
<P>
How do you feel about the recent Judas Priest verdict? 
</P>
<P>
Some parents should be notified that their upbringing is detrimental to the 
child's health. Children learn things outside the home and the old "do as I 
say, not as I do" philosophy doesn't work. Parents need to be aware of peer 
pressure. That's how I started smoking; I thought it was cool. But I'd be 
giving my girlfriend this soul kiss and she'd make this face like "yuck." She's 
a total health freak and I've since quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
What do you think of bouncers? 
</P>
<P>
They're all like you and I. I give them respect; they're people, too. They may 
be big, bad and ugly on the outside, but on the inside they're just like us. 
They try to gain respect by bulking up. They're just there to protect us. 
Sometimes fans get carried away and they want to get up onstage with us; I 
guess we're their idols. Usually, they just stay a few seconds then jump off. 
But if they stay too long, the bouncers are supposed to get them off the stage 
-- gently, without beating anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Describe the new album, "Rust in Peace." 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's the first album we've done where everyone was there, if you know 
what I mean. There are no covers this time and we even have a new single, "Holy 
Wars." People may think it's about the Middle East, but it's not. I wrote it 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Good album titles. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks.

<P>
THE VENTURA 20; 
</P>
<P>
NOVICES CAN FIND OUT IF THEY'RE A BUDDING AL UNSER JR., WHO STARTED HIS CAREER 
IN A KART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a few brief moments, after slowing to a halt on the Ventura Freeway, you 
close your eyes and mentally take a fast ride. 
</P>
<P>
You're on a raceway! Your wheels grip the curves as you flatten the 
accelerator. A checkered flag and a screaming crowd inspire you to new excesses 
of speed. Varoom! 
</P>
<P>
Then it's open the eyes and back to slow and go. Not for you, the Indy. You are 
not Shirley Muldowney, nor were you ever meant to be. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a middle of the road. 
</P>
<P>
To find it, you get off the freeway, head down Harbor Boulevard in Ventura and 
park your sedan in a lot near the beach. From the sound of engines, you deduce 
correctly that you have arrived at Jim Hall's Kart Racing School. 
</P>
<P>
The school is open seven days a week and offers novices the chance to release 
the race car drivers within them. Students learn the steering, braking and 
passing techniques of racing karts. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Carol Smith assures you that these babies are not to be found next to 
the Big Wheels at Toys 'R' Us. Big-name racers such as Al Unser Jr. and Michael 
Andretti, she says, began their careers by driving karts. 
</P>
<P>
"You sit one inch off the ground in a frame only, because there's no body to 
the kart, and go about 85 m.p.h.," she says. "It's got a 17-horsepower, 
two-cycle, 100-cc Yamaha engine and an Emmick Express chassis." Goodness. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the nagging thought that learning to drive fast in Southern California 
is probably like taking surfing lessons for a trip to Death Valley, you decide 
to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
Past the chain-link fence surrounding the school's parking lot is a paved track 
in the shape of a man's hat. There are nine turns in all, several of them 
streaked with black skid marks and bordered by protective bales of hay and 
heaps of tires. Six karts are lined up along one stretch. Behind them are 14 
chairs where 12 men and two women will have their first lesson on vehicle 
dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
Now, vehicle dynamics is one of those terms you're convinced ranks right up 
there with interpersonal relationships. Even Eric Campbell, the tanned, 
self-assured racing instructor, seems to consider it best to deal lightly with 
what the karts can and cannot do. 
</P>
<P>
"The steering radius on a kart is only this far," he says, turning an imaginary 
steering wheel in the air. "And if you turn too sharply, it'll lock up." The 
class stares at him intently. "I don't know what'll happen then," he says with 
a smile, "but I can tell you it won't be good." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell reassures the group about safety at his school and in general. Since 
1982, according to Smith, more than 9,000 students have taken the course 
without suffering any serious injuries. Even children, if they are 8 years old 
and 5 feet tall, can take the class. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief lesson on the meanings of flags and hand signals, you and three 
fellow students are given racing jackets, helmets and gloves. With your chin 
strap fastened tightly, you ease yourself into the bucket seat, clutching the 
wheel at 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock. Campbell gives you the signal to go. You 
press your foot down tentatively and move onto the track. 
</P>
<P>
The engine is loud, and the asphalt is only inches from your elbow. You 
approach the first curve cautiously, Campbell's warnings in your head and your 
heart pounding in your chest. On your first lap, your top speed wouldn't get 
you stopped in a school zone. 
</P>
<P>
A few laps later, though, you're pushing the accelerator down. This, you think 
as your kart rips around corners, is what driving was meant to be. Never mind 
that your fellow students are zooming around you. 
</P>
<P>
Later, assistant instructor Tim Moser tells you that your speed did increase, 
but your driving form is, well, still a bit haphazard. This is not news. You've 
heard the same thing from your spouse. 
</P>
<P>
After each student has completed the introductory 10 laps, the class is led by 
Campbell onto the track. For the next half hour, he walks slowly, pointing out 
the ideal travel line, as well as the paint marks that indicate the best 
turning spots. Knowing the line of a track and the best places to brake and 
accelerate, he says, cuts time considerably. 
</P>
<P>
A few more practice laps and then the stopwatch is pulled out for the final 10. 
"The goal is to get faster each lap," Campbell says. "Your last lap should be 
your fastest." 
</P>
<P>
When it is your turn, you pull down your racing visor and gun your engine. The 
stopwatch clicks as you put the pedal to the floorboard. You round the first 
curve confidently, telling yourself that you can outrun the competition if you 
concentrate. You whiz down the straightaway. You imagine the checkered flag. 
The excitement. The new track record. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the sky whirls before your eyes like a revolving blue plate. You have 
spun out. Other than the mega-levels of adrenaline in your system and a 
slightly bruised ego, you are all right. Edging back onto the track, you take 
your final two laps, more conservatively this time. 
</P>
<P>
Your best time, Campbell tells you, is better than average. With a few advanced 
training sessions, he says, which cost $150 for half a day, who knows how far 
you could go? 
</P>
<P>
You don't know, but it's time to go home. You get into your trusty four-door, 
push aside the Ninja Turtles and lunch boxes on the seats, and put the key into 
the ignition. Giving the engine an unnecessary gun, you head for the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Now if everyone would just get out of your way, you think as traffic comes to a 
standstill, you could show them how it's done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

FOR THE KIDS TIDE POOLS;

THE CHANNEL ISLANDS VISITOR CENTER OFFERS A CLOSE-UP VIEW OF LIFE ABOVE AND

<P>
Park Ranger Pat Hackney reached into the indoor tide pool at the Channel 
Islands National Park Visitor Center and pulled out a round, bumpy sea 
cucumber. 
</P>
<P>
"Want to touch it?" he asked one of the kids surrounding him by the tide pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Yuck," was her answer. 
</P>
<P>
That's not surprising, given the disgusting manners of the sea cucumber. It has 
the unusual ability to upchuck its intestines to distract its enemies. Then it 
simply regrows them. 
</P>
<P>
That's but one curious fact about the marine life in the artificial tide pool 
at the Ventura Harbor. Hackney held up a strand of kelp and showed that it 
grows at the astonishing rate of 18 inches a day. Then he picked up a Wavy Top 
Turban Snail and pointed to its "trap door" that enables it to crawl inside its 
shell to be safe from enemies. 
</P>
<P>
The tide pool -- also home to abalone, scallops, anemones, starfish, crabs and 
coral -- is an example of the sea life that can be found in the Santa Barbara 
Channel. The little pools are what is left behind when the tide goes out. 
</P>
<P>
This indoor pool is a gathering spot for children and parents on Saturday and 
Sunday at 3:30 p.m. when Hackney or other rangers feed the pool dwellers. Not 
that the inhabitants need the handout of mussels. They get what they need from 
the kelp. The morsels of mussel are an added treat and give the 20 or so 
onlookers a chance to see and hear more about the fish. 
</P>
<P>
Hackney dropped a mussel tidbit near a crab and in less than a second it was 
gone. Another crab hauled away a shell with a morsel on it. Hackney fed a 
little piece of kelp to an abalone. 
</P>
<P>
He said tide pools are not easy to find around Ventura. But they are prevalent 
around the Channel Islands or at Carpinteria State Beach and farther north 
along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor center at the end of Spinnaker Drive has a lot to offer for free. 
On Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m., one of the rangers gives a 30- to 40-minute 
program in the center's auditorium on topics related to the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Saturday, Ranger David Ethell talked about the endangered 
California Brown Pelican that breeds on West Anacapa Island, the only breeding 
spot for the birds in the Western United States. 
</P>
<P>
The birds live almost entirely on anchovies. They dive-bomb for fish from 
heights of 30 to 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"They put their wings behind them, open their beaks and go for it," said 
Ethell, standing next to a stuffed pelican. 
</P>
<P>
Pelican numbers dwindled to a precious few during the 1960s because the 
chemical DDT got into the food chain, Ethell said. Because of it, their egg 
shells were too thin and would break when the 35-pound birds sat on them. DDT 
was banned in 1972, and the bird population increased. 
</P>
<P>
The rangers present other programs on such topics as whales and the Chumash 
Indians. In "Pinnapeds on Parade," they dress a child from the audience in a 
life preserver, put fins on his hands and feet to simulate flippers and cover 
him with fake fur to show how the seals and sea lions adapt to marine life. 
</P>
<P>
In the Chumash program, a ranger talks about how the Indians lived off the sea 
and how they traveled across the Santa Barbara Channel in their canoes made of 
driftwood logs. 
</P>
<P>
The center includes a museum of sorts that illustrates how the Indians 
survived. Children can pretend they are grinding grain like the Indians did 
using sand, a rock mortar and pestle. 
</P>
<P>
Children can handle caliche, sand castings of once live plants. They can see an 
example of a caliche ghost forest, similar to the eerie outcroppings on the 
islands. They can see a stuffed island fox and find out what other plants and 
animals can be found on the islands. The center also sells books, maps and 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
For a better view of the islands and Ventura, visitors can climb up to the 
center's observation deck to use the telescopes. They can also see a 25-minute 
film about the islands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: The Channel Islands National Park Visitor Center, located at 
the Ventura Harbor at the end of Spinnaker Drive, is open daily from 8 a.m. to 
5 p.m. For information, call 644-8262.

RELEASE BY SINGER/SONGWRITER DAVID BAERWALD, NOW GOING IT ALONE, IS GARNERING 
ACCLAIM.

<P>
Most critics agreed that David + David's 1986 album, "Boomtown," was one of the 
coolest releases of the decade. But now it's the '90s and David + David became 
David. David as in Ricketts is gone and Baerwald remains, and his current 
release, "Bedtime Stories," is garnering similar acclaim. The L.A.-based 
singer/songwriter will be at The Carnaval Club in Santa Barbara Monday night, 
sort of a musical alternative to the NFL. Baerwald's lyrics are equally 
hard-hitting -- there's just less blood. 
</P>
<P>
A wry writer with a cynic's wit, Baerwald describes losers losing, winners 
losing, whiners whining, winners whining, lovers leaving, losers loving and 
everyone pretty much confused and overwhelmed by it all. Baerwald's not exactly 
a barrel of laughs. He could have written great film noir mysteries in the 
'40s. 
</P>
<P>
David + David originally planned a follow-up to their 1986 debut, but Ricketts 
got sidetracked producing an album for folk singer Toni Childs, and the project 
was forever sidetracked. On the new one, Baerwald collaborated with Larry 
Klein, who co-wrote many of the tracks. David + Larry? However you add it up, 
the new one, produced by Los Lobos sax man Steve Berlin, is more Angst with a 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent telephone interview, Baerwald had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
What about the tour and the new record? 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Barbara show will be the first show on the tour although we did play 
The Roxy a week or so ago. It was a breeze. The album is doing about like the 
last one. 
</P>
<P>
David + David was a hit. Now it's David. What happened? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you can only have a big brother for so long before you want to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Like Wally and The Beaver? 
</P>
<P>
Exactly. 
</P>
<P>
How is this album different from the last, or is it different? Is it true that 
Ricketts basically did the music and you wrote the lyrics? 
</P>
<P>
Not really. Both Ricketts and I play guitar, bass and keyboards. The new one is 
very similar to the old one, except on this one Larry Klein did most of the 
music. We had people come in for the stuff we couldn't do or didn't want to do. 
We'll have a six-piece band on our tour. 
</P>
<P>
Describe David Baerwald music. 
</P>
<P>
Genius. 
</P>
<P>
On the album cover, you're holding your head in your hands as if you're in 
pain, in deep thought or looking in the mirror at Peter Murphy, what's wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I'm embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
In a Rolling Stone interview you say that " ... it's easier to survive if 
you're a killer -- especially if what you killed is something inside yourself 
... " Explain. 
</P>
<P>
I think I was talking about a song called "Stranger," and how things can happen 
to a person that just makes you want to sit down and quit being open with 
people. It's too early in the morning for this stuff. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to Ricketts? 
</P>
<P>
He's still around -- he's on his way over right now. We're still friends. 
</P>
<P>
Was J. Geils right, does love stink? 
</P>
<P>
No, love is what makes the world go 'round. 
</P>
<P>
Does bad love make for good songs? 
</P>
<P>
It can go both ways. 
</P>
<P>
How did you get started in music? 
</P>
<P>
I'm from Ohio originally, but my family moved to Japan when I was a kid -- my 
Dad is a teacher. I learned to play guitar in Japan. Then we moved to Los 
Angeles, and I didn't know anybody in school until I met this other kid who 
also played guitar. So we started a band when I was about 12 or 13. We played 
parties and stuff and then the punk thing happened and sort of sucked us up. I 
used to be a roadie for The Weirdos. I used to play in bars when I was 15 -- I 
grew up in nightclubs. Anyway, since I was underage, they'd make me wait 
outside in the parking lot until it was time to play. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Newman loves L.A. Is he right? 
</P>
<P>
L.A. is paradise. 
</P>
<P>
There's a pretty intense song on the new one called "Dance." Does everyone, 
even the wall flowers, dance? 
</P>
<P>
Everybody's got to dance sometime. 
</P>
<P>

THE MOVIE "MEN AT WORK" COULD HAVE USED SOME COUNTY TRASH-SMART ROLE MODELS FOR 
REALISM.

<P>
Have you seen "Men at Work," advertised as "Two Garbagemen Who Know When 
Something Smells Fishy"? It's the new environmentally themed movie with Charlie 
Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Lest you think this is going to be a plug for the 
movie, let me say right now: I think it's fishy. 
</P>
<P>
Where have these filmmakers been lately? They're out of date and out of touch. 
The movie shows the public and the government to be utterly ignorant and 
passive about garbage problems and solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it wouldn't have "played" if the garbage team hadn't included the 
obligatory psychotic Vietnam vet and instead had a grandma with a magna cum 
laude in history, such as the Ventura County Solid Waste Management 
Department's Pandee Leachman, a waste management analyst. Maybe the characters 
played by Sheen and Estevez in the movie are easier to relate to because 
they're bumblers -- unlike the brainy folks I know at the waste management 
offices in the city and county of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Werbalowsky, the city's new recycling coordinator, is a seasoned and canny 
environmental educator. I like his slogan, "Catch the WAVE -- Waste 
Alternatives for Ventura's Environment." He comes from the movie business, a 
delicious irony. 
</P>
<P>
David Goldstein, now a county waste management analyst, is a Phi Beta Kappa 
with a degree in political science. He initiated recycling programs while still 
in college and went to work in Santa Clarita and Los Angeles in collection, 
marketing and financing of recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
Why compare these folks to fictional movie characters? Well, I'm upset that the 
movie showed nothing of the current California environmental awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Industry wants to recycle for new materials and cities want relief from 
landfill lease expenses. And in California, where this film is set, every city 
has to cut its trash flow by 25% soon or face stiff fines from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
In the film's fictional Southern California surf town, recycling is not 
mentioned. But last Saturday, local civil and business leaders gathered to hear 
from a hired consultant, Roger Selbert, who is a conservative banking 
economist. His contention is that the main challenges the county economy faces 
are transportation and recycling (to solve landfill problems). 
</P>
<P>
As exemplified by the real-life Venturans I've mentioned, a new breed of 
pioneer has appeared here lately, people such as original pioneers: socially 
mobile and egalitarian. 
</P>
<P>
I've chosen my example environmentalists because they have something in common 
-- they've all had training at the West Point of waste management, UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA Recycling Design Program is conducted by a dozen experts in the field, 
including Gary Peterson, president of Ecolo-Haul. The certification program 
received national recognition as the most innovative University Extension 
course last year. 
</P>
<P>
When Peterson heard that I was a writer based in Ventura, he beamed. "Our three 
top students just went to work there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible to say that Gary Peterson started the professional thing 20 years 
ago in Malibu (a real surfer-garbageman, ironically) when recycling was 
considered almost subversive. He persevered through financial and political 
hard times to the point that his privately held recycling company was so big, 
it was bought by Waste Management. He has been credited with getting all of Los 
Angeles into recycling, "We would never have done this citywide otherwise," 
said John Stodder, the mayor's environmental chief. 
</P>
<P>
This will not be the last column about people in this profession. I just want 
to begin reporting that, in addition to our at-home efforts for the 
environment, there are professional efforts too. 
</P>
<P>
So, when I saw that movie with airheads pitted against the crooked waste 
hauler, I said there's another tale to be told here. Watch this space for their 
further adventures.

BIAS: EVER SINCE HE SUED DISNEYLAND OVER ITS BAN ON SAME-SEX DANCING, ANDREW

SOME CALL HIM A PEST.

<TEXT>
<P>
The kid who sued Disneyland has grown up. 
</P>
<P>
This week marks 10 years since Andrew Exler was kicked out of the Magic Kingdom 
for dancing with another man. Exler was 19 then. He won a civil rights battle 
that made headlines around the world and Disneyland ended up allowing same-sex 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
As a sort of anniversary party, Exler has invited gay and lesbian friends to 
join him Saturday at the amusement park and "dance the night away." He wants to 
celebrate, to relax. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a busy decade. 
</P>
<P>
The Disneyland case lasted four years and was a turning point in Exler's life. 
He was an argumentative teen-ager who'd always seen himself as something of an 
activist. Now he had found an outlet. Exler embarked on a crusade. He sought 
out injustice. He filed more lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
First he sued Chippendales because men weren't admitted to its male strip 
shows. Next he sued a Hollywood nightclub, claiming its "ladies free night" was 
sexually discriminatory. He even sued a senior citizens mobile home park in the 
Palm Springs area, where he lives, charging age discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
As Exler's legal experience grew, his litigious wrath expanded. He discovered 
that submitting a civil rights complaint to the state Department of Fair 
Employment and Housing was nearly as effective as going to court. He promptly 
went after gas stations here. Some of the self-serve stations advertised: "We 
Serve Ladies." Now, when you drive through town, you see signs that have been 
changed to read "We Serve You -- Just Ask." 
</P>
<P>
In August, Exler filed suit against Gloria Marshall Figure Salons because they 
don't admit men. It was his sixth well-publicized lawsuit to go with several 
smaller cases and 30 state complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Exler's activism has been directed primarily at men's rights. He has been 
lauded as a pioneer in the field, and to some extent, epitomizes the little guy 
who dares to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
But, at a time when minorities, gays and women are still fighting for equality, 
anyone who speaks up for a relatively privileged class is a target for 
contempt. And Exler's affinity for lawsuits has led him to be branded by 
critics as a professional litigant. 
</P>
<P>
"Enough of Exler," read a letter in the Desert Sun newspaper in the wake of the 
mobile home park suit. "Mr. Exler is not satisfied with attacking women, 
private enterprises, Mickey Mouse, now he directs his selfish, warped sense of 
values toward senior citizens. . . . He is a troublemaker who should get lost." 
</P>
<P>
Exler is unfazed by such criticism. His words, though self-righteous, are 
calmly spoken. 
</P>
<P>
"Black people tell me, 'Don't compare what you're doing to what civil rights 
leaders of the '60s did,' " he says. "But I don't see any difference between 
what I'm doing and what Rosa Parks was doing when she refused to get up and go 
to the back of the bus. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm right and I fight." 
</P>
<P>
Dark clouds hang close over the desert as shards of lightning flash in the 
hills. Exler steers a pale blue Cadillac through rain-washed streets that are 
deserted in midafternoon. The unseasonal storm has driven people indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Life is generally quiet in this resort town, so it has not taken long for Exler 
to become known here. Or despised, some would say. In the three years since he 
moved from Los Angeles, the newspapers have received many letters from him, the 
radio station many phone calls. The woman who runs the public law library often 
sees him pawing through the stacks. Palm Springs' gay community has repeatedly 
asked Exler, who is openly gay, to tone down his act. 
</P>
<P>
"People wonder what he is trying to accomplish," says Jim Suguitan, editor of a 
gay and lesbian publication called the Bottom Line. "I used to think he was out 
for the notoriety. Now I can see that Andrew has his heart in the right 
direction but sometimes he's misguided." 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union refused to endorse Exler's Disneyland suit. 
Other activists have complained that his cases distract the court from more 
pressing civil rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
"With the Chippendale's case, I've heard people say 'What do we need this right 
for?' " said Jon Davidson, a senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Exler filed similar complaints against Zelda's, a Palm Springs Club, 
and Pompeii, in nearby Cathedral City. He says, simply: "People have always 
been against me." 
</P>
<P>
In person, this man is not contentious. He is pudgy and pale, wearing a Mickey 
Mouse watch and two earrings, though his left ear has five piercings. 
</P>
<P>
His business card reads: "Andrew Exler, Danced at Disneyland, legal assistant, 
civil rights activist, free-lance journalist, 1991 law student." And he is not 
shy about using the word crusader in self-assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Critics scoff. Exler has not attracted any sort of organized following, they 
say. Nor does he fight with the activist's more established weapons of protest 
or boycott. 
</P>
<P>
"Lawsuits are much more effective and they can be quicker," Exler responds. "I 
can go to court and make a change. I can file a complaint with the state and 
stop a business from discriminating. 
</P>
<P>
"And you don't have to go looking for these lawsuits," he says. "When people 
are getting screwed, you see it. You read about it in the newspaper and hear it 
on the radio." 
</P>
<P>
Doubters have also accused Exler of profiting from his lawsuits, of living off 
the settlements he makes with businesses that he files against. 
</P>
<P>
Exler says that, as part of such settlements, he is prohibited from revealing 
specific amounts. He insists that he's received no more than $4,500 over the 
past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Some of that money has come from lawsuits, though he says he didn't make a dime 
from the Disneyland case. The rest has come from submitting state complaints 
under the Unruh Civil Rights Act, which legislates against discrimination by 
businesses. Any business found in violation must change its discriminatory 
policy and pay a minimum of $250 to the complainant. Exler says he often 
withdraws his complaint without payment if the business agrees to reform. 
</P>
<P>
"Civil rights plaintiffs lose more often than they win," says Erwin 
Chemerinsky, a USC law professor. "Can someone get rich from filing civil 
rights suits? It's possible to imagine that but I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
"The question really isn't whether he does or doesn't make money," Chemerinsky 
says. "The question is whether he is bringing meritorious or frivolous suits. 
My instinct is that he's serving a social function because he's testing what 
the law means and questioning gender roles." 
</P>
<P>
If Exler is making money, he does not show it. He drives a 14-year-old car and 
lives in a mobile home that he owns. He has worked, in recent years, as a 
filing clerk, a hospital employee and a paralegal. 
</P>
<P>
"The only gain made in civil rights cases is changing the law. Usually the 
plaintiff and the attorney lose money," says John J. Duran, an Anaheim gay 
rights attorney who is representing Exler in the case against Florentine 
Gardens, the Hollywood club that admits miniskirted women free of charge on 
certain nights. "Andrew is working to ensure equal rights for men. . . . Andrew 
is a part of the reformation of American culture." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Exler's lawyers speak so glowingly. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Allred took on the Chippendales case in June, 1988. Allred has made a 
name for herself handling similar suits and she initially sang Exler's praises. 
Theirs might have been a match made in civil rights heaven. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't work out that way. 
</P>
<P>
Exler says that he (and two co-plaintiffs) were hoping to take the case to 
court and win a judicial ruling that would set legal precedence for male strip 
clubs. Allred, however, was convinced they should accept a settlement. She 
believed that Chippendales offered better terms than Exler et al. could have 
won in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised," Exler said. "I felt this would be a very strong case." 
</P>
<P>
Heated telephone conversations ensued. Then, Exler says, Allred promised that 
if he settled the case, she would get him on "The Oprah Winfrey Show." 
</P>
<P>
"I have never promised to get anyone, including Andrew, on any television 
show," Allred says. "I do not produce 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' and I have no 
control over who that show will choose as its guest." 
</P>
<P>
When Exler did not accept the settlement offer, Allred says she withdrew as his 
attorney. Exler subsequently settled out of court, anyway. Chippendales gave 
him a letter of apology, an undisclosed amount of money and a promise that men 
would be allowed into the show, Exler says. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond rebutting his claims, Allred tersely declines to talk about Exler. He 
says he remains disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always Gloria's biggest fan," he says. "I'm not anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe activism, like charity, begins at home. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Marilyn Exler was determined to say a blessing over the Torah at her 
son Andrew's bar mitzvah. Few Conservative temples afforded women such 
privileges then. But Marilyn Exler had often discussed the importance of civil 
rights with her three boys and she wasn't about to back down from this fight. 
She protested and became the first woman to take part in a service at Temple 
Beth Emet in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"What I said to Andrew was that if you believe in something you should fight 
for that belief," recalls Marilyn, who is a family law attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The incident remains vivid among Exler's childhood memories. Not that he needed 
much goading. 
</P>
<P>
"Always arguing," Marilyn recalls of him. "Yes, there were some difficult 
times." 
</P>
<P>
By fifth grade, Exler was refusing to say the Pledge of Allegiance or take part 
in the noontime prayer at school. By age 16, he was writing letters to local 
newspapers condemning the school board for what he saw as inadequate sex 
education. 
</P>
<P>
And by the time he went to Disneyland with a gay friend, Exler was determined 
to challenge the amusement park's ban on same-sex dancing. He had discovered a 
larger arena in which to do battle. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes life very tough for him," says his mother. "Whenever you speak out, 
especially on issues that are unpopular, you are going to have people attack 
you. I don't know that I'd be able to withstand the criticism that he has." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Exler's causes are popular at home. His father, a retired engineer, 
disagrees with the Gloria Marshall case. His brother, an Orthodox Jew living in 
Israel, does not accept Andrew's homosexuality. Soon, Exler says, he will 
challenge discounts given to senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents qualify for those discounts," he says. "They don't like it when I 
bring that up." 
</P>
<P>
To this day, Disneyland insists that its decision to allow same-sex dancing had 
nothing to do with Exler. The scope of the ruling, park officials say, was 
limited to him and his partner. Yet Disneyland quietly changed its policy in 
1985, at roughly the same time it dropped an appeal of the Exler case. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it had to do with me," Exler says. 
</P>
<P>
The cases are pending against Florentine Gardens and Gloria Marshall -- Exler 
filed separate suits against the figure salon in Orange County and Los Angeles 
Superior courts. In the meantime, Exler works at a temporary job as an 
administrative assistant and lives with a man who is continually mistaken for 
the one who danced with him at Disneyland. Exler has also restricted himself to 
a diet of salads and has lost nine pounds "in spite of Gloria (Marshall)," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The line is thin, perhaps, between someone who feels he must fight injustice 
and someone who simply goes looking for a fight. If so, Exler has always 
consciously treaded that line and continues to do so. 
</P>
<P>
He recently took on the public law library because it wouldn't stay open on 
Saturdays. Entering a restaurant for lunch, he picks up a senior citizen's 
discount coupon as fodder for a possible future case. And he has a suit pending 
in small claims court against the company that maintains his trailer park. He 
claims they got tar on his Cadillac while repairing the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't fight," he says, "you don't get anything." 
</P>
<P>
Should Exler get accepted to a law school next fall, he doesn't expect to be 
filing many suits in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have to start slowing down because there won't be the time once I 
start studying," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, some people will be relieved to hear that. 
</P>
<P>
"A few," Exler says. "But I'll catch up with them eventually."

<P>
FILM: A TRULY ECLECTIC MIX OF LIVE MUSIC ACCOMPANIES TONIGHT'S HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
SCREENING OF THE GERMAN SILENT MOVIE 'THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The days of outdoor movies at the Hollywood Bowl continue. On the heels of last 
year's "Alexander Nevsky" and last month's screening of "Singin' in the Rain" 
comes a screening tonight of the 1921 German silent film "The Cabinet of Dr. 
Caligari." 
</P>
<P>
But this latest cinematic-music event -- part of the Los Angeles Festival -- 
promises to be considerably more inventive if not controversial. The film will 
be accompanied by a live soundtrack provided by the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
performing John Adams' tone poem "Harmonielehre" under the baton of David Alan 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to this odd mixture of Expressionism and contemporary music will be 
two especially different local ensembles: the five-member World Kulintang 
Ensemble (an ancient Philippine gong and drum ensemble) from Reseda and the 
F.A.M.E. Gospel Choir from central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a West Coast event, with strong ties to Los Angeles and San Francisco, 
but with other elements scattered here and there as well," Los Angeles Festival 
director Peter Sellars explained by telephone while rehearsing at Cahuenga 
Pass. "In Los Angeles, one type of culture doesn't swallow up another, they all 
exist in diversity, and this concert celebrates this idea." 
</P>
<P>
"Months ago, Peter told me he had a dream and vision of our ancient gong music 
being performed on the same stage as the L.A. Philharmonic," recalled Eleanor 
Academia-Magda, director of the Kulintang ensemble. "It came as no surprise a 
few weeks ago when he asked us to join this event." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the performance was to include the world premiere of a silent film 
by Sellars entitled "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez," a non-satirical but 
occasionally humorous examination of the world of Wall Street. Because of his 
duties at the Los Angeles Festival, he was unable to shoot the film last July 
as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars wrote the movie with Adams' "Harmonielehre" in mind as a soundtrack. He 
defends this process of filmmaking, putting the images to pre-existing music, 
as a product of today's culture as well as a return to movies like Walt 
Disney's "Fantasia." 
</P>
<P>
"We're in an era of MTV and the idea of matching images and music in this way 
is very logical," he explained. "More and more, our culture is growing 
non-verbal and that's not good in many ways, but in some ways it's a relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember first hearing 'Harmonielehre' at about 2 a.m. as I was walking home 
from the Kennedy Center in Washington. (Adams) had sent me a rehearsal tape and 
I was listening to it on my Walkman. 
</P>
<P>
"I pictured the music as the soundtrack of a lost Alfred Hitchcock movie. I 
could imagine a fevered Jimmy Stewart riding in a car while the music plays." 
</P>
<P>
Because the initial inspiration for the film was "Harmonielehre," Sellars 
wanted to keep an event dedicated to that work. He hopes that using "Dr. 
Caligari" instead of "Dr. Ramirez" will enhance both the film and add a 
dimension to Adams' work that is not immediately perceptible. 
</P>
<P>
"The silent era of film is my favorite time for movies," Sellars said. "And the 
artists who worked on 'Caligari' weren't very prominent after the film opened. 
This was their one claim to fame. It's a great movie, but not that good of a 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
"And most people find John's music very transparent, and can't immediately hear 
the connection he has made with Schoenberg." (The title for Adams work comes 
from a treatise on harmony by Arnold Schoenberg.) 
</P>
<P>
"By putting this film -- with all its German Expressionist roots -- alongside 
the music, elements of the music that usually go unnoticed are drawn out," 
Sellars said. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Harmonielehre' is basically a musical gloss on the styles and moods of 
Expressionism, though very whimsical," Adams said during a recent trip to Los 
Angeles, where he is working on a documentary film for children with Sellars. 
"I'm sure that this will change the original intent of the film, since music 
creates the context of a cinematic situation." 
</P>
<P>
Adams admits that these recent projects have made him eager to work in the area 
of film as he imagines the numerous possibilities. But he remains skeptical 
about playing the role of a traditional Hollywood film composer. 
</P>
<P>
"Every now and then I get a package from someone in Hollywood who wants me to 
score a movie, but then I look at the scripts, which usually aren't that good," 
Adams said. "I think of all the work it would take and usually conclude that 
it's just not worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally a filmmaker should consult with the composer from the very beginning 
of a project but because film is so expensive, collaborating like that is 
almost impossible."

The Children of Bali danced through its final performance at Rosemont Avenue 
Elementary in downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday. The 22-children troupe in 
traditional costumes culminated L.A. Festival appearances at the school to 
honor an exchange program they had with the second and fifth grade students. 
The host students presented their farewell gift to the Balinese children: a 
shadow puppet show, a rendition of "This Land is Your Land" and a demonstration 
of square dancing. "After they leave I'll still remember everything they did, 
and everything we did for them," said 10-year-old Rosemont student David 
Guanzon. The local school -- composed of 75% Latino students have spent the 
past three months learning Balinese culture and language. Children of Bali will 
continue its first U.S. tour in New Jersey.

MUSIC: MIXING VEDIC CHANTS WITH AMERICAN JAZZ, DR. L. SUBRAMANIAM MAY BE IN THE 
VANGUARD OF A CROSS-CULTURAL TREND. HE'LL PERFORM TONIGHT AT THE WADSWORTH 
THEATRE.

<P>
The Los Angeles Festival appearance of Indian classical violinist Dr. L. 
Subramaniam tonight marks an opportunity to hear the music of one of the area's 
surprisingly underpublicized performers. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of the San Fernando Valley since 1973, Lakshminarayana Subramaniam 
spends eight to 10 months touring each year, with only rare public appearances 
in the city he calls home. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it's true," he said by phone from London. "I don't perform nearly as much 
in Los Angeles as I would like. But most of the musicians I record with live on 
the West Coast, as do many members of my family. And I love the weather. So I'm 
very happy living there, even if I don't have enough opportunities to play my 
music." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's Subramaniam concert at the Wadsworth Theatre will feature the violin 
virtuoso in a program of Indian classical music performed with an unusual 
ensemble of four percussionists. 
</P>
<P>
"It is quite an unusual sound," Subramaniam said. "The percussion instruments 
include the tavil -- a barrel-shaped drum played with a stick in the left hand 
and pads on the right-hand fingers. Then there's the big, two-sided drum, the 
mridangam, a clay pot drum called the ghatam and a tambourinelike thing called 
a kanjeera. And, of course, I'll be playing solo violin. We'll do strictly 
Indian classical music, probably with some ragas of my own composition." 
</P>
<P>
Typical of Subramaniam, the ensemble represents an effort to stretch the 
envelope of a musical form. Trained in both Indian classical and Western music 
(he has a master's from CalArts in addition to an unused Indian degree in 
medicine), he has been a persistent and hard-working advocate of innovation 
within tradition, as well as of the interaction between musical cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"As an oral tradition, Indian music is strongly based in tradition," 
Subramaniam said. "Even so, each new generation tries to push the boundaries of 
the instrument and the music -- just as Paganini did with Western violin 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
"Violin and flute, for example, used to play roles as vocal accompanists in 
Indian music. But now they've become solo instruments as well. In addition, we 
still play ragas, but instead of playing in 1 1/2 octaves, we might play in six 
octaves. And instead of playing an eight-beat rhythm cycle, we might play a 21 
1/4-beat cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight," Subramaniam continued, "I'll play with four percussionists -- an 
unusual number of rhythm instruments -- which will call for careful 
organization to get maximum benefit from the different sounds and timbres. All 
of this is still well within the tradition of Indian classical music. What 
we're trying to do is make new innovations and new forms of expression based on 
that tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Subramaniam's interest in expanding the expressive potential of his music 
reaches well beyond its origins in the Indian oral tradition. In 1985, his 
"Fantasy on Vedic Chants" was performed by Zubin Mehta and the New York 
Philharmonic. (Since then, it has been performed in Moscow, Geneva, Paris and 
New Delhi, but never, sadly, in Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
Other Subramaniam orchestral works blending Indian and Western elements include 
a Double Concerto for Violin and Flute (commissioned and performed in the early 
'80s by the New American Orchestra, with Hubert Laws as the other soloist), a 
Double Concerto for Two Violins, and a Concerto for Violin and Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
As a fusion artist, he has recorded with a dynamic range of jazz musicians, 
from Stephane Grappelli and Maynard Ferguson to Herbie Hancock, Larry Coryell, 
Stanley Clarke and Tony Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Subramaniam sees nothing especially unusual about such cross-cultural 
activities. If anything, he perceives his work as the vanguard of an evolving 
trend toward musical interactivity. 
</P>
<P>
"To the casual listener, Indian music seems vastly different from Western 
music," he observed. "But they had very similar origins. We believe our music 
started with the Vedic chants -- first, via single-note lines, then, in order 
to emphasize the texts by raising and lowering pitches, by three-note 
tetrachords. Western music started similarly, with monotonal chant and 
Gregorian chant, which then evolved through all the various stylistic changes 
into the present. 
</P>
<P>
"What people are doing now -- in classical music, jazz and rock -- is writing 
pieces using elements from other cultures in an effort to create new styles. 
Which makes sense, because there is so much traveling and so many opportunities 
through records and video to hear what people are doing in different countries 
that listeners no longer hear only the music from their own societies. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe," continued Subramaniam, "that there will be more and more 
contact, and more interchange of ideas and concepts between cultures. And a 
place like Los Angeles, where there are people from many different cultures, is 
an especially fertile ground for this kind of creative interaction. 
</P>
<P>
"My only hope," he concluded with a small chuckle, "is that my performance 
tonight might generate some other opportunities -- perhaps via a performance of 
my "Fantasy on Vedic Chants" -- to work on that interaction right here in my 
own town."

COSTA MESA TO LOOK AT 'SISTER MARY IGNATIUS' FOR ARTS-GRANT VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Costa Mesa City Council has asked the City Attorney's Office to determine 
whether the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse has violated terms of its city arts 
grant with a staging of Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It 
All for You." 
</P>
<P>
The action is the first test of controversial arts-grant guidelines forbidding 
use of city funds for obscenity or "religious or political activity," adopted 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
Local residents, led by John and Ernie Feeney, have branded the play 
"anti-religious bigotry" and charge that it violates restrictions against 
religious activity. Ernie Feeney has said she hoped to see the play canceled, 
but the matter will not come before the city council until Oct. 1, one day 
after the play is scheduled to end its run. 
</P>
<P>
The Feeneys' previous objections about a pro-NEA flyer issued by South Coast 
Repertory in Costa Mesa led to the adoption of the restrictions attached to all 
city arts grants. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the playhouse board of directors issued a defense of the production. 
"Satire is not a crime and free speech is not a felony," the statement reads in 
part. "It is not our duty to tread so lightly as to avoid offending everyone, 
and we are not sorry we selected (the play)." 
</P>
<P>
David Sharp, co-producer of the play and a playhouse board member, said 
Wednesday that "the phone is ringing off the hook" with ticket requests, but 
there is little chance the run will be extended. RICK VANDERKNYFF

LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE THINS OUT RABBIT HERD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach City College's legendary rabbit population, which has figured into 
campus politics and theatrical productions, was thinned a bit during the 
summer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 rabbits were removed by county agriculture workers at the request of 
college officials. "It was an ecological imbalance," said Tracy O'Connell, a 
college spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The rabbits were lured into cages baited with lettuce and carrots, then were 
released in Harbor Regional Park, a large public park with plenty of water and 
vegetation in Harbor City, said Richard Wightman, deputy agricultural 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like a good environment for them," Wightman said. "I don't know what 
else they would need." 
</P>
<P>
About a third of the college's estimated bunny population was relocated, the 
first such effort since the rabbits began appearing on campus in the early 
1980s. A proposal to eliminate the animals three years ago was dropped after 
the campus newspaper ran heated editorials against the idea, students staged 
demonstrations to support them and about 1,100 people signed a petition to keep 
them on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The recent effort encountered no such opposition, despite stories in the campus 
newspaper, said John Taylor, acting director of support services. He attributed 
the lack of opposition to the decision to limit the number of rabbits being 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows exactly how the bunnies got there in the first place. Veteran 
staff members say wild jack rabbits were seen for years on the college's 
Liberal Arts campus on Carson Street, which used to be a bean field. 
</P>
<P>
But about seven years ago, they say, wild rabbits began disappearing, to be 
gradually replaced by tame rabbits with fluffy fur of various colors. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular theory is that nearby residents began abandoning their pet 
rabbits on campus and that the wild rabbits moved on to greener pastures, 
leaving the tamer brand to proliferate at a rate of about four new bunnies a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
For years their presence on the 68-acre campus has generally been considered 
harmless. Much loved by students and staffers alike, the animals have been 
parodied by administrators wearing bunny suits in skits during the college's 
annual Colleague Capers Variety Show. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago a candidate for the college's board of trustees, using the Latin 
word for the rabbit family, jokingly claimed the endorsement of the "bipartisan 
Leporidae Political Action Committee -- a small but active group on campus" -- 
and even persuaded a handful of supporters to appear at a candidates' forum 
dressed as bunnies. 
</P>
<P>
By last spring, however, the rabbit population had become so large that some of 
the animals began venturing into residents' yards near the campus, prompting 
complaints by neighbors that the rabbits were devouring their flower beds, 
O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
That is when campus officials decided to act. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to be good neighbors," said John Didion, former campus director 
of support services, adding that the timing of the rabbit roundup -- during the 
summer months when most students were gone -- is purely coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
He was quick to add, however, that campus visitors can still find at least 100 
of the critters lolling on the lawns, sitting on the sidewalks or biting at the 
bushes. 
</P>
<P>
"I assure you that there is no shortage of rabbits on the campus," Didion said.

SANTA FE SPRINGS: ORDINANCE PROVIDES PENALTIES TO FORCE OWNERS TO REPAIR UNITS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials acknowledge they were spurred by conditions at one apartment 
complex when they passed a law last May requiring an annual inspection of all 
rental housing in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, armed with flashlights and checklists, inspectors entered 11711 
Florence Ave. for the first time under the law designed to upgrade dilapidated 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
At the Florence Fountain Apartments, inspectors found a wide range of health 
and safety violations, including dangerous substandard electrical wiring, roach 
infestation, inoperative smoke alarms and water damage to bathrooms and 
kitchens, said Fernando Tarin, the city's director of housing and community 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
One apartment has lacked hot water for more than a year, the tenant said. Dirt 
has replaced grass in several landscaped areas. And water splashed from the 
pool runs up to the front doors of some units. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't surprised with what we found, to be honest with you," Tarin said, 
"considering the number of complaints we received." 
</P>
<P>
Such complaints had prompted the City Council to pass its ordinance requiring 
an annual inspection of every apartment in the city. The program pays for 
itself by charging owners an annual inspection fee of $50 per unit, plus $25 
for reinspections of units that are not up to code. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, repairs at the 81-unit Florence Avenue apartments must begin 
immediately or its owners -- Florence Realty Fund Ltd. of Los Angeles -- face 
utility shut-offs and criminal penalties of up to six months in jail or a 
$1,000 fine per violation. 
</P>
<P>
Repairs could also prove costly, up to $100,000, the building's management 
estimated. The landlord has sent notices that inspection fees will be passed on 
to renters. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be worth it," tenant Sheila Guzman said, "if they fix this place up." 
</P>
<P>
Guzman, a 36-year-old mother of two, regularly applies a heavily scented 
freshener to compete with the smell of roach spray permeating her kitchen and 
living room. All her pasta and cereal sits in sealed plastic containers above 
her refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
"I spray for roaches every night before I go to bed," she said. "I lost my fish 
over it, but you got to do it or live with bugs crawling all over you." 
</P>
<P>
In her bathroom, water damage has bubbled and discolored the walls. With a tug, 
Guzman can pull plumbing fixtures out from the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman and her husband pay $775 a month for their two-bedroom, two-bath 
apartment. "It's got to get better around here for the prices we're paying," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some apartments needed comparatively minor work, not one unit 
completely passed muster last week, when Tarin and city inspector Wayne Morrell 
looked over several apartments with Tom Flores, who represents Incomvest 
Properties, the management company. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said many of the building's deficiencies existed when his management 
company and the current owner took over more than two years ago. "We bought the 
building in as-is condition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores likened the 26-year-old complex to a used car that seemed to run well in 
the showroom, then fell apart a few months after purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The heating system, which breaks down easily, would never be installed in a new 
building, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Tarin told Flores that the bathroom plumbing, which has caused 
severe water damage, will probably need replacing. 
</P>
<P>
Wiring under the sink must also be fixed, Tarin said, in part because repairs 
had been made by unlicensed contractors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very fortunate someone didn't get electrocuted," Tarin said. 
</P>
<P>
Incomvest has also had electrical wiring problems at a 106-unit apartment 
complex it runs on North Cerritos Avenue in Azusa, said Dave Rudisel, Azusa's 
community improvement manager. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Springs modeled its inspection ordinance on Azusa's, which was the 
first Southern California city to begin annual rental inspections. Azusa 
officials declared the local Incomvest complex a public nuisance in January. 
</P>
<P>
Rudisel said Incomvest became more cooperative after realizing that the city 
planned to enforce penalties. "Apparently, only some minor problems remain," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Fe Springs, the renovation has already begun, Tarin said, motioning 
toward the sparkling pool, in which about a dozen children frolicked. "A couple 
of months ago, that pool was green," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the outside of the complex's buildings has been repainted. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said his company intends to cooperate with city officials in both Santa 
Fe Springs and Azusa. He showed off several renovated apartments. "As they 
become vacant, we either put in new carpet or change the drapes to vertical 
blinds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said bad tenants, including some with gang ties, have caused much of the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Caminos, 33, the new on-site manager, pointed to where an evicted tenant 
punched three holes in a door before departing. 
</P>
<P>
"He even stole the apartment numbers off the door," Caminos said. "I had just 
got the fountain working, and the day he moved out, he knocked it down." 
</P>
<P>
Tarin said despite initial costs, the inspections should ultimately benefit 
landlords by documenting which tenants trash apartments. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city would support the eviction of renters who damage property: 
"We'll be able to help them get the problem tenants out." 
</P>
<P>
Caminos said he intends to screen potential tenants more thoroughly than 
previous managers. In an interview earlier this year, his predecessor had said 
the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Do me a favor," shouted 15-year tenant Mary Jo Haller to Caminos and Flores. 
"Rent the apartment above me to a nice, single person." 
</P>
<P>
A family with six children had previously rented the two-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Tarin said: "These used to be some of the nicest apartments in the city. We 
were surprised to find they went downhill so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect it all to be fixed in 30 days. As long as they're making 
progress. . . ."

DEVELOPMENT RESTRICTED ON STREETS NEAR HISTORICAL ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moving to put a buffer zone around the new Willmore City Historical District, 
the Long Beach Planning Commission has restricted development in the Drake Park 
area and portions of 7th Street between Pacific and Maine avenues. 
</P>
<P>
The action is intended to protect additional historic structures and strengthen 
design controls for renovation and new construction in the downtown-area 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 property owners decried the proposal, saying property values have 
plummeted and the requirements make renovating or rebuilding financially 
unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
Multifamily development will be permitted only on sites where no historic 
structures now sit or where such buildings have been successfully moved to 
another location. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of historic buildings will be allowed to convert them to 
bed-and-breakfast inns, add artists' lofts or pursue other limited commercial 
efforts. The new restrictions allow late Victorian, California Bungalow, 
Mediterranean Revival and Craftsman architectural styles and prohibit Queen 
Anne, Art Deco and Modern International. 
</P>
<P>
Among the property owners to praise the plan was Councilman Evan Anderson 
Braude, a Willmore resident since August, 1989. "The value of this property is 
going up, even with the down-zoning," he said.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: MONTEBELLO; 
</P>
<P>
GROUND WILL BE BROKEN FOR LONG-AWAITED FIRE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of delays, groundbreaking is scheduled at 11 a.m. Friday for a fire 
station on the south side of Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
The station, at Greenwood Avenue and Date Street, will replace one of 
Montebello's oldest fire stations built in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
According to the plans, the station will be almost 10 times larger than the old 
station, and will house a captain, engineer and two firefighter paramedics. The 
station also will house the city's fire prevention bureau, emergency services 
section and the police community services office where residents can file 
reports or make complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5-million project, which was originally discussed in 1970, is scheduled 
for completion next September.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;

<P>
STREET CLOSURE OKD FOR SHOPPING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Whittier City Council voted 3 to 2 Tuesday night to provide the developer 
of a more than $20-million redevelopment project with a quarter-mile portion of 
magnolia Avenue north of Whittier Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth advocates Helen McKenna-Rahder and Bob Henderson voted against the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
Closing part of Magnolia, a popular north-south shortcut, remains an essential 
feature of the proposed shopping center, designed by Urbatec of Encino. The 
city's Redevelopment Agency had already approved the site plan. 
</P>
<P>
The road abandonement " is an inconvenience," said Mayor Thomas K. Sawyer. 
"There's no question of that. But it would be extremely difficult not to go 
ahead with this project." 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing Tuesday, Urbatec's proposed 16-acre shopping center drew nearly 
as much criticism s the road closure from more than a dozen residents who 
addressed a standing-room-only crowd of about 130. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of residents living on Magnolia argued for the closure, saying it 
would make the street safer and quieter.

MANAGER GETS CONTRACT EXTENSION, PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Norwalk City Council has extended the contract of City Manager Richard R. 
Powers by two years and raised his salary 26%, from $89,675 to $113,300 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The council also gave Powers a $7,500 bonus, which will be placed in a deferred 
compensation account, for outstanding performance during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Powers' original three-year contract, made in 1988, was extended by two years 
and will expire in July, 1993. All of the council members touted Powers' work 
for the city. Powers said his proudest achievements include eliminating a 
$3.3-million annual operating deficit the city faced at the time he became city 
manager.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: SOUTH GATE;

<P>
EX-MANAGER TO GET $63,500 SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Gate City Council has decided to pay $63,500 to former Administrator 
Bruce Spragg, who was fired last month. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to avoid any possibility (of a lawsuit), we negotiated," Mayor Robert 
A. Philipp said after the council approved the severance settlement last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The council also rescinded its Aug. 20 firing of Spragg, who then submitted his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Spragg, 57, had been the city administrator for more than eight years at an 
annual salary of $87,000 when he announced on Aug. 13 that he planned to retire 
in March. The council then asked Spragg to resign by Aug. 17. He refused and 
the council fired him. 
</P>
<P>
William D. Cornett Jr., a former South Gate city administrator, has been called 
out of retirement to head the city staff until a new administrator is named. 
The search for a new administrator could take up to four months, Philipp said.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: WATER DISTRICT TO REPORT ON GARVEY RESERVOIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under pressure from Monterey Park officials and state Sen. Charles M. Calderon 
(D-Whittier), the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California has agreed 
to submit a full environmental impact report before beginning repair work on 
Garvey Reservoir, which last year leaked and flooded more than a dozen homes. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old reservoir was shut and drained nearly dry in November, when 
divers discovered two cracks in the clay liner. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the water district has proposed to reinforce the reservoir with 
concrete and asphalt lining, dig more wells and install an intricate drainage 
system. Repairs would cost an estimated $20 million to $25 million and take a 
year to complete.

CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT? TIPS ON GETTING COOLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sure, the air out there feels as if somebody thought you were tonight's rib 
roast and slipped you into the oven at a slow bake. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't have to take it. This is 1990, and there are things you can do 
about the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Like get a job at an ice house. While his friends melt in their back yards and 
living rooms, Steven Fierro, 17, an Azusa High School senior, toddles off to 
the Monrovia Ice Co. in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
Here, in blissfully frigid air, he helps to shepherd a torrent of ice cubes 
into plastic bags, or chops steaming 300-pound blocks down to size with an ice 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
If he finds himself getting a little overheated -- during the hot weather, the 
plant on Huntington Drive can spit out as much as 20 tons of ice a day -- 
Fierro just strolls into the storeroom, where all those bags of cubes are kept 
at an icy 20 degrees. Here, Fierro and co-worker Eric Leal take a few breaths 
of arctic air and think about what it must be like outside. 
</P>
<P>
"On days like this," Fierro said, "I just want to come to work." 
</P>
<P>
There's no relief in sight. Rick Dittman, a meteorologist with Weather Data 
Inc., said there is a huge high pressure system parked on top of Southern 
California like a lid on a barbecue grill. 
</P>
<P>
The normal "thermal trough," with offshore breezes wafting across the region, 
has been reversed, Dittman said. "Now you have winds blowing down from the east 
and the north, and cities like Monrovia, at the base of a huge mountain range, 
are in a perfect position for really hot weather," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia reached highs of 109 degrees for three days running this week, and 
other foothill cities were experiencing similar temperatures. The prospects are 
for similar weather through the weekend, Dittman said. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley residents have been finding lots of ways to escape that 
oven, or at least to step away from its direct blast. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody seems to have a favorite escape. There are back-yard swimming pools 
and Raging Waters, the water attraction in Bonelli Park in San Dimas. There are 
home air conditioners, shopping malls and air-conditioned movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Some cool-off strategies can't be shared. "I go home and sit in front of the 
air conditioner buck naked," a 16-year-old Pasadena girl said. 
</P>
<P>
At times like this, Sandy Gollihugh knows she's in the right business. As the 
rest of Pasadena contends with 104 degrees, Gollihugh is zipped into a heavy 
leather jacket for her job as an ice-skating instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it gets cold in here," Gollihugh said, leaning against the rail at 
the Pasadena Ice Skating Center on East Green Street. "On days like today, I 
know I made the right choice." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, there were great stretches of open ice at the center, as some of 
Gollihugh's students practiced their pirouettes and figure eights. A group of 
high school students from the Siloam Church Youth Group in Paramount celebrated 
their last day of vacation, charging around the rink in a chain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of tradition with us," said Sarah Choe, 16, a student at Warren 
High School in Downey. "We come here every year." 
</P>
<P>
Across the street at the Plaza Pasadena mall, the pace was slow, and the 
atmosphere was cool. Pedro Lopez, a retired store clerk from Pasadena, 
confessed that he had been in the mall for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very agreeable here," he said, sitting on a main-floor bench, with not 
the least inclination to move on. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not into winter sports and malls aren't your cup of tea, there's 
always Pasadena Superior Court. Court-watchers there are keeping their eyes on 
the trials being played out in air-conditioned courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Out at the Los Angeles County Fair, at the Fairplex in Pomona, four of the 
exhibit halls are air-conditioned for the first time. And horse racing begins 
today. For $3, you can watch the races from the air-conditioned clubhouse. Or 
for a $5 minimum, you can take a table at the race track's Top of the Park 
restaurant, which has a panoramic view of the track and its own parimutuel 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people head for the mountains. Mt. Wilson was a moderate 89 degrees 
Tuesday, 20 degrees lower than some of the cities below. Just as important, Mt. 
Wilson weather observer Lu Rarogeiwicz said, the 5,800-foot mountain is above 
the smog line. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley ozone levels have been soaring into the "very unhealthful" 
range most days this week. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a heavy blanket over the Basin," Rarogeiwicz said from his mountaintop 
perspective. "I can't really see into it -- it's a lovely brown color. But it's 
clear overhead. I can see all the way to San Clemente and San Nicolas islands, 
between 100 and 110 miles away." 
</P>
<P>
If the heat should fray tempers to the boiling point, there's plenty of room at 
the Pasadena Police Department lockup. "We can house 43 people here," Sgt. Jay 
D'Angelo said. "All of our cells are air-conditioned." 
</P>

PIRATES' PRIDE HIGH IN FACE OF DIVISION CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was hustle and bustle time at Paramount High School last Friday, the final 
weekday before classes began. Construction workers, their saws whining, 
scurried to finish a $9-million science and administration complex. 
</P>
<P>
Electrical wires hung from ceiling panels, and floor covering stood boxed 
beside a barren stairway. Teachers, some wearing T-shirts proclaiming the 
school's back-to-back Southern Section Division III football titles, carted 
boxes of beakers and books. 
</P>
<P>
Football Coach Ken Sutch endured the din, his bright blue eyes gleaming at all 
the changes. Hours later in the season opener, Paramount rolled on, mauling 
Bell Gardens, 27-6. 
</P>
<P>
Like the new building, Paramount's football team is full of wrinkles but loaded 
with promise. Only eight starters return from last year's 13-1 team, but 
because Sutch allowed almost everyone to play last year, a host of experienced 
players return. 
</P>
<P>
Against Bell Gardens, Steve Lopez and Larry Hooper, both backups last season to 
All-Southern Section Jack Manu, took turns at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes for better morale and for better practices," Sutch said. "I owe it to 
the kid that comes out every day and runs sprints alongside the rest of the 
players. If I have the opportunity to play him, I will." 
</P>
<P>
It was easy for Sutch, 65-25 in his ninth season, to let everyone play last 
year. In more than half its games, Paramount held halftime leads as large as 35 
points. The only loss was to Lynwood, but that did not stop the Pirates from 
winning their second San Gabriel Valley League title. 
</P>
<P>
It might not be so easy this season. Only two Southern Section teams have won 
three consecutive titles. And this year, in an attempt to balance the level of 
play, the Southern Section bumped up fifth-ranked Paramount into Division II, 
which includes perennial finalists Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley, Muir of 
Pasadena and El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Paramount faces a tough battle with Dominguez and Lynwood just to 
defend its two consecutive league titles. 
</P>
<P>
Sutch, 42, who attended Millikan High in Long Beach, is known to be fair, 
honest and a disciplinarian. Miss a practice, miss a game. A tardy player must 
spin a wheel that hangs from a wall in the school's musty weight room. The 
wheel is divided into sections, each assigning some type of physical activity 
as discipline. 
</P>
<P>
In Sutch's early years, more than one player crawled the football field, or ran 
an extra mile. A few got lucky when the arrow found the "pardon" slot. The 
wheel has made his job easier, Sutch said. 
</P>
<P>
"Consistency is so hard, yet so important," Sutch said later over a roast beef 
lunch at a Paramount coffee shop. "Discipline has to be fair to work." 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens Coach Dave Newell said: "If you look at Paramount on film, it is 
very simple. What (Sutch) has is discipline and tremendous athletic speed, and 
he is able to get the best out of the talent he has." 
</P>
<P>
If pulling starters at the half last year was a noble thing to do, it wasn't 
always the right thing statistically, Sutch admits. Running back Leon Neal, a 
returning starter who was an All-Southern Section selection as a junior, 
carried the football only 100 times in 10 regular season games. 
</P>
<P>
"Could you imagine what his statistics would have been if we had left him in 
(each) game?" Sutch asked. 
</P>
<P>
Neal, who gained 1,729 yards last year, ran for 59 yards in eight carries 
against Bell Gardens. But he threw several key blocks for some of those other 
players who were backups last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section titles served as a rallying point for many in Paramount, 
which was in physical and economic dilapidation in the late 1970s but rebounded 
to win an All-American City award two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Sutch: "The football team has brought a lot of pride to this city, 
and (the city) has paid us back." 
</P>
<P>
City officials bought championship rings for the players last year. Renovation 
of the lights and bleachers at the football field, scheduled to begin shortly, 
is being paid for completely by donations, Sutch said. 
</P>
<P>
Sutch, Jim Monico and Rick DeCicco joined Paramount High as assistants in 1975 
and worked with veteran Coach Tom Davies at a time when the team had won one 
game in five years. Sutch, who had been a successful sophomore coach at Long 
Beach Wilson, said: "We were three young pups with an older head coach, and we 
thought we knew everything," Sutch said. 
</P>
<P>
Player morale was in disarray, and teachers bet on how badly the varsity would 
be defeated. But in 1979, Paramount won the Suburban League title. 
</P>
<P>
Sutch left to become coach at Workman High in Industry in 1980 and Paramount, 
which was moved into the tough San Gabriel Valley League, had 1-8 and 5-4 
records. When Davies took an administrative post in 1982, Sutch became the 
Pirate head coach, rejoining Monico, his longtime friend. DeCicco left after 
the 1975 season but returned this year. Glen Kaskela and Mike Giers are also on 
the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"What the success with football has done for the school is incredible," 
Paramount Principal Maureen Sanders said. "It has been great for our 
self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
Academics have also benefited, Sanders said. Paramount established an 
early-morning tutoring program for athletes. Others are also picking up their 
books more. "The students have really, really pulled together because they have 
realized that they can make a difference (in their lives,)" Sanders said.

PREVIEW OF AREA TEAMS: POLY, PARAMOUNT EXPECTED TO REPEAT AS CHAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Coil

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is a preview of Southeast/Long Beach area high school football teams. The 
predicted order of finish, indicated by number, is based on information 
supplied by coaches and compiled by Mike Coil of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MOORE LEAGUE Perennial favorite Poly's biggest challenge could come from 
Wilson, but Lakewood, Millikan and Jordan should also contend. 
</P>
<P>
1. POLY -- The youngest Jackrabbit team in 11 years is inexperienced in the 
secondary and offensive line. Only one starter returns on defense, safety 
Richard Washington, another in a long line of great defensive backs at the Long 
Beach school. Other top players are tight end Chris Love, an excellent 
receiver, and guard Edward Hopkins, who started every game in a 9-2 league 
championship season a year ago. "We are going to play like a bunch of wild and 
crazy guys," said co-head Coach Jerry Jaso. Poly lost its opener, 14-7, to 
Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
2. WILSON -- "We are going to be right in the thick of it," said Coach John 
Brennan. The Bruins (7-5 overall and 4-1 in league play last season) have good 
players at the skill positions, but an inexperienced defensive line. Running 
back Mike Steward (160 yards in a 14-12 opening win over Servite) and safety 
Dante Lewis are all-league. Wilson will miss center Buster Layton, now at Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo, and tackle Demario Vaughn, now at Arizona State. Both 
were all-CIF. 
</P>
<P>
3. MILLIKAN -- The Rams, fourth in the league last season, are young and 
inexperienced, but optimistic Coach Dave Radford, a 27-year veteran, said, "We 
have good unity and (the players) are a joy to be around." Jeremy Jones, a 
three-year starter, returns to running back after playing quarterback last 
season. Larry Satterlee is an all-league defensive end. The Rams beat St. 
Anthony, 29-9, last week. 
</P>
<P>
4. LAKEWOOD -- The Lancers ended a 19-game road losing streak last Friday night 
by beating Warren, 21-14. This is a pass-minded team whose top receivers are 
all-league Johnny Horner and A. J. Marinelli. Brian Kaveney, a senior with a 
strong arm, takes over for the graduated Robert Fonseca at quarterback. Coach 
Mark Rose said his linemen are young. 
</P>
<P>
5. JORDAN -- The Panthers, who lost their opener to Mission Viejo, 42-12, are 
led by 6-foot-3 Joel Rosborough, one of the area's best wide receivers. The 
quarterback is junior Johnnie Nanson. The Panthers must improve their defense 
to avoid another losing season. They were 1-9 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
6. COMPTON -- New coach Mike Wells, a former player at San Diego State who was 
a teacher last year at Compton, takes over a team that was 1-8 and 0-5. The 
Tarbabes are above average at the skill positions but weak in the line, Wells 
said. Top players are running back/linebacker Brian Bradford and quarterback 
Edward Hervey. Compton is scheduled to play at its home field Oct. 12 for the 
first time since fire destroyed the stands three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAN GABRIEL VALLEY LEAGUE Paramount, Dominguez and Lynwood should fight for the 
league title, with the other four teams evenly matched. 
</P>
<P>
1. PARAMOUNT -- The Pirates will try for their third consecutive Southern 
Section title. Returning from a 13-1 team is all-CIF back Leon Neal, who gained 
more than 1,700 yards last season. Neal and DeMondre White (9.5 yards a carry) 
are part of the best backfield Coach Ken Sutch said he has ever had. Larry 
Hooper and Steve Lopez will alternate at quarterback, replacing all-CIF Jack 
Manu. 
</P>
<P>
2. DOMINGUEZ -- Bruce Walker has gone on to UCLA, but Willie Donerson's Dons 
have seven starters back from an 8-4 team. The most prominent are track star 
James Jackson, who scored 11 of the 37 times he carried the ball last season, 
and wide receiver/defensive back Lavell Townsend. "We should be in the top 
three in the league," Donerson said. Quarterback Anthony Young passed for 97 
yards last Thursday in an opening 43-0 victory over Centennial. 
</P>
<P>
3. LYNWOOD -- "We are rebuilding attitudes, philosophies and techniques, and we 
are starting from ground zero," said Coach Ben Carpenter, a former Lynwood 
assistant who was a graduate assistant last season at Cal State Long Beach. 
Carpenter, off to a good start with a 28-15 victory over Notre Dame of Sherman 
Oaks, succeeds Joe Hembrick. The Knights, coming off a rare mediocre season 
(5-5), have a strong offensive line and a talented secondary, but lack 
linebackers. Eugene Jackson, an all-CIF cornerback, will try to replace 
graduated star Charles Levy at quarterback. Lineman Don Jacobs was all-league 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
4. DOWNEY -- The Vikings, trying to bounce back from a 3-7 and 0-6 season, 
opened with a 42-26 victory over Damien as sophomore quarterback Johnnie Macon 
ran for three touchdowns and threw for one. The Vikings have two dependable 
linemen in Robert Bayles, who also plays linebacker, and all-league tackle 
Demetrious Maxie. Coach Phil Dunaway said improving the defense will be the key 
to making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
5. GAHR -- Coach Steve Silberman, after turning around a losing program, has 
moved on to Macalester College in Minnesota. So the Gladiators, 7-4 last year, 
will have to start over under Steve Nishimoto, former coach at Fullerton High. 
"We have a lot of catching up to do," he said. Returning starters include 
safety Frank Thornton, who will also play quarterback, and cornerback/running 
back Darius Cunnigan. Gahr beat California, 15-10, last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
6. WARREN -- The Bears, 3-7 last season, will depend on junior quarterback Jon 
Miller and senior linebacker Mark Zapata. Miller threw for 179 yards in an 
opening 21-14 loss to Lakewood. Coach John Hennigan has a lot of returners at 
running back and wide receiver, but the offensive line is new. 
</P>
<P>
7. CERRITOS -- The Dons were 2-8 a year ago but Coach Harold Eggers said his 
young team is much better. Leslie Davis is the best runner on the team and 
quarterback Jon Nielsen started last season. Davis made a 75-yard TD run in an 
opening 24-16 loss to La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHITMONT LEAGUE Bell Gardens, El Rancho, Whittier and Montebello are expected 
to fight for the title, as they did last season. 
</P>
<P>
1. MONTEBELLO -- With the graduation of all-CIF Miguel Cortez, the Oilers are 
inexperienced at receiver. But they are strong defensively and in the offensive 
line. Top players are defensive end Hector Del Rio and center Jesse Robledo. 
The Oilers were 8-3 and 5-2 last season and finished in a second-place tie with 
El Rancho and Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
2. BELL GARDENS -- Tailback Rudy Ramirez (50 TDs in two years) is gone, but 
Coach Dave Newell still sees his team, 7-4 last season, as a top contender. "We 
have good receivers and a good offensive line," Newell said. Jesse Rafanon, who 
caught 29 passes for 489 yards last season, is back. The best returning lineman 
is tackle Jose Paulo. The Lancers lost their opener to Paramount, 27-6. 
</P>
<P>
3. EL RANCHO -- Nine juniors start on defense for Dick Shelko's Dons, who were 
7-5 and 5-2 last season. The most prominent players are junior quarterback Jim 
Arellanes, who threw for 1,000 yards last season; Noe Lopez, an outstanding 
kicker, and 6-5, 285-pound senior offensive lineman Matt Hicks. The Dons lost 
their opener to Los Altos, 21-13. 
</P>
<P>
4. WHITTIER -- The defending league champion Cardinals had one of their 
greatest seasons in 1989, but Coach Mike Fitch said, "The only thing that 
matters is the present." The team is fast but not as big as it was last season. 
Top players are quarterback Eric Somilleva, fullback Albert Sethman and 
offensive lineman Fernando Hernandez. The Cardinals, who lost to Covina, 14-7, 
last week, have a tough preseason schedule. 
</P>
<P>
5. SANTA FE -- The Chiefs, 6-4 in 1989, are young and have only two defensive 
starters returning, safety Jim Hudnall and linebacker Chris Sandoval. Coach 
Mike Thomas thinks his team will be fighting for third or fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
6. CALIFORNIA -- The Condors, who lost their opener, 15-10, to Gahr, have the 
experience to improve on a 2-8 record. Quarterback Larry Haney threw for more 
than 1,500 yards last season as a sophomore. Paul Martinez is an all-league 
tailback, and linebacker Shawn Olivarez leads the defense. "I think we will 
surprise some people this year," said Coach Tom Tereschuk. 
</P>
<P>
7. PIONEER -- Taking over the Titans is Hugh Mendez, who was head coach at 
Whittier College the last 10 years. "We will beat somebody," he predicted. If 
that happens, the Titans will improve on last season's 0-10 record. They lost 
their opener, however, 15-12, to Bassett. Tight end Danny Guerrero is the top 
returning letterman. 
</P>
<P>
8. LA SERNA -- Wayne Manzo's Lancers, 1-9 last season, won't have quarterback 
Brian Dunningan, who has decided to play only baseball. The main Lancer will be 
runing back/safety Alfredo Martinez. Linebacking looks strong with Scott Keen 
and St. Paul transfer Jim Uhl. La Serna, which lost to La Habra, 26-0, in the 
opener, lacks depth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SUBURBAN LEAGUE La Mirada has the size and the defense, but Glenn, Norwalk and 
Mayfair can't be counted out. 
</P>
<P>
1. LA MIRADA -- The Matadores, who were 9-4 and did well in the playoffs last 
season, have seven players back on defense, including all-CIF tackle Mike 
Cardona (6-4, 280) and linebacker Kendall Alexander. Alexander rushed for 134 
yards in a 24-16 victory over Cerritos last Thursday. The player from last 
year's team that Coach John Mele will miss most is fullback Joe Fernandez. "If 
we get the offense going we have a shot to win it," Mele said. 
</P>
<P>
2. GLENN -- The Eagles were 9-2 last season and finished in a first-place tie 
in the league with Norwalk. They began this season with a 24-13 victory over La 
Puente. Paseko Teo, who gained almost 1,000 yards, is back, as are Jerry 
Jornadal, who rushed for 350 yards, and all-league guard Joshua Henderson. 
Coach Willie Norman has only 30 players and will miss all-CIF back Travis 
Carter, who graduated. 
</P>
<P>
3. NORWALK -- The Lancers average 230 pounds on their offensive line, but they 
lost eight defensive starters from an 8-2 team, including all-CIF back Chuck 
Stafford, who moved to Chicago. All-league Eric Peterson is back at tight end. 
The Lancers edged Sierra Vista, 23-21, last week. 
</P>
<P>
4. MAYFAIR -- The Monsoons, the only team to beat Glenn in the regular season, 
have seven starters returning in their bid to be a contender. Chris Shubin 
(6-3, 260) was impressive last season as a sophomore tackle. Damion Watson is 
an effective two-way back who scored twice in an opening 28-14 victory over 
Keppel. Larry Hilliard is the new coach. 
</P>
<P>
5. ARTESIA -- Eight starters are back on defense, only two on offense from a 
3-7 team. Tackle Jimmy Buford was all-league last season, as was linebacker 
Scott Rafferty. "If we live through the preseason we will do pretty well," said 
Coach Norm Flowers. The Pioneers survived the first game, 15-13, against Valley 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
6. BELLFLOWER -- "We are picked dead last so every game we win is an upset," 
said Coach Doug Bluth, who started his first full season last week with a 21-6 
loss to South Torrance. The Bucs, 1-9 last season, are led by 
tailback/defensive back Marcus Galbreath and fulback/linebacker Jacob Davis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CAMINO REAL LEAGUE Serra is expected to win, with everyone else contending for 
second place. 
</P>
<P>
ST. ANTHONY -- Run-oriented quarterback Garnett Overby, who started last season 
as a sophomore, and fullback Lincoln Sii lead the Saints, but Overby injured 
his hip in the opening 29-9 loss to Millikan. Coach Ralph Godfrey said his 
defensive line is untested. The Saints were 3-7 last season. 
</P>
<P>
PIUS X -- The Warriors' 17-7 opening loss to Santa Fe was their 21st successive 
defeat, but that streak may end. "Everyone thinks we are going to be last but 
if we're healthy we'll win a couple of games in league," said Coach Mike 
Gallegos. Up from a champion sophomore team is running back/defensive end Phil 
Ward. The best veteran is Devon English, who impressed as a runner last season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OLYMPIC LEAGUE Once again, Whittier Christian and Valley Christian are the 
class of the league. 
</P>
<P>
WHITTIER CHRISTIAN -- The Heralds are quick but inexperienced. Coach Phil Bravo 
said 23 players on last season's 11-1 team graduated. Returning are offensive 
lineman Ryan McEntire, a three-year starter, and two-way end Carl Martinez, who 
was all-league in 1989. The Heralds outscored Dos Pueblos, 41-40, in the 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
VALLEY CHRISTIAN -- "We can't afford to get hurt, we're dressing 26 guys," said 
Coach Mike Wunderley. The Crusaders have a sound defense and running game, but 
will miss quarterback Chris Miller, who graduated. Top returnees from a 10-2 
team are all-CIF linebacker Mike Overgaauw and tailback Mitch Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OTHERS SCHURR -- "I should be able to score some points, I hope," said Coach 
Ken Davis, who has all-Foothill League quarterback Jay Macias and all-league 
tight end Danny Vargas. But the Spartans, 7-4 and 4-1 last season, lack depth 
and already have had injuries to some starters. They tied highly regarded 
Montebello, 15-15, last week. 
</P>
<P>
ST. JOHN BOSCO -- The Braves, coming off a 4-6 season, appear solid on offense 
as they move into the Angelus League. Coach Gabe Soumakian's top players are 
center Alex Hannaman and tackle Bobby Mendoza, both three-year starters. Bosco 
will miss defensive standout Mike Munoz, who graduated. The Braves lost to 
Valencia, 10-7, in their opener. 
</P>
<P>
ST. PAUL -- The Swordsmen, who have moved from the Angelus League to the 
Mission League, have Albert Borunda back at quarterback, but he threw four 
interceptions in an opening 17-0 loss to Loyola. His top receiver last season, 
Steve Corpus, is now at East Los Angeles College, and all the pass catchers are 
new. Joe Ledesma, a 6-2, 250-pound tackle, is the team's best lineman. "Our 
depth is definitely a problem," said Coach Miguel Olmeda. 
</P>
<P>
CENTENNIAL -- "If there is a strength, it's the running game," Coach James 
Emery said. "We moved the ball well against Dominguez (in a 42-0 loss last 
week)." Tailback Raydon Hawthorne and fullback Eric Jones lead the Apaches, who 
were winless last season and finished last in the Pioneer League. Emery was at 
Compton College and was the golf coach at the school last year. 
</P>
<P>
CANTWELL -- The Cardinals of the Santa Fe League, 4-5-1 last season, are led by 
tailback Carlos Zarate (923 yards in 1989) and tackle Lou Ayala, a strong 
blocker. Coach Mike Noonan said the weakness is tackling kick returners. Last 
season, opponents returned five kicks for touchdowns, and the opening kickoff 
last week resulted in a TD for Maranatha. But the Cards won, 34-6. 
</P>
<P>
LEFFINGWELL CHRISTIAN -- The Lions, 3-6 last season, will be led by tailback 
Allan LeCour, who had 1,500 yards in total offense as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
PIONEER BAPTIST -- This team, in the eight-man division, has only eight 
players, the best of whom is guard/defensive end Bobby Barnard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CITY SECTION SCHOOLS SOUTH GATE -- The Rams, coming off a 10-1-1 season, have 
all-league offensive tackle Carlos (The House) Nunez, who Coach Gary Cordray 
said is as quick as a mouse. They also have linebacker Steve Martinez, who had 
nine sacks last season. But the Rams do not have star runner Ivan Wilson, who 
is now at El Camino College. Of 22 starters, 21 are seniors, but they lack 
experience. "I would say our chances of winning the league are not very good," 
Cordray said. "It will be between us and Fremont for second place. Locke will 
win the league." 
</P>
<P>
HUNTINGTON PARK -- Quarterback Chris Hernandez, who threw for more than 1,000 
yards and 10 touchdowns in 1989, leads the Spartans. On defense, the key player 
is all-league linebacker Manuel Carvajal. Coach Dwight Muskrath said his team 
will contend for the league title despite an inexperienced offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
BELL -- Of eight starters who were thrown off the team for disciplinary reasons 
last season, six are back, which makes Coach Ray Galarze hopeful of improving 
on a 3-7 record. Two of those players are Armando Lara and Marshall Valante, 
who were all-league running backs as sophomores. Gilbert Garcia is an 
experienced quarterback. The Eagles lack kickers.

ROBIN BISIO'S ENVIRONMENTAL WORKS WILL BE PUT ON THIS WEEKEND AT THE OUTDOOR 
DANCE FESTIVAL.

Women in flowing gray slips dance in the moonlight. Performers skip through a 
flower garden in a merry promenade like elves in a child's fairy tale. Four 
dancers, their bodies buried in sand, their faces covered by seaweed, slowly 
emerge from the beach in a representation of Genesis. 
</P>
<P>
All three of these dances were choreographed around and rely upon their 
environment. "We feel the outdoor sites are beautiful sources of artistic 
information and inspiration," said choreographer and dancer Robin Bisio of the 
Cormorant Dance Foundation. The three numbers will be performed this weekend as 
part of the Santa Barbara Outdoor Dance Festival, founded by Bisio four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Each piece "emanates from the sense of the place in which it was born," Bisio 
said. For example, the "Mimetic Moon Dance" expresses the haunting, mysterious 
qualities of a moon-shadowed night, the "Rose of the World" number takes on the 
mood of a garden of flowers. "It almost conveys the feeling that little, 
magical people are coming out in secret and dancing around the roses," Bisio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The popular moon dance will be performed for the third time in the festival's 
history Friday at 9 p.m. at the County Courthouse sunken gardens, Anapamu and 
Santa Barbara streets. This is the second year for the rose dance, which was 
also performed during the opening ceremonies of the Los Angeles Festival on 
Sept. 1. Unlike prior daytime performances, this one will be at 9 p.m. Saturday 
at the Mission Rose Garden lawn, Los Olivos and Garden streets. Bisio said, by 
way of explaining the time change, "The spirits of the garden come out to play 
by night; we wanted to be there when they did." 
</P>
<P>
New to the festival is the "Sand Shiva" which will take place at 3 p.m. at Mesa 
Lane Beach, at Mesa Lane Drive off Cliff Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Once again the grand finale will be the Coastal Dance Project, Sunday from 2 to 
4 p.m. at Thousand Steps Beach, Santa Cruz Street below Shoreline Drive. The 
beach stairs at Shoreline Park can also be used for coastal access. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 artists and dance groups will gather on a half-mile stretch of beach 
to dance in the waves and sand, to create works of art by the ocean, to read 
their poetry out loud. "This is a gathering of artists, not an art show and 
sale," Bisio said. "The whole event is noncommercial." 
</P>
<P>
All events are free, and the audience is encouraged to bring lawn chairs and 
picnic foods. The dances last about half an hour each. For more information, 
call 962-6945 or 963-0611 Ext. 4539. 
</P>
<P>
Solvang will also be animated with dance and song this weekend during the 
annual Danish Days Festival. The small town founded by Danish settlers is best 
known for its Danish look -- even modern hotels and restaurants boast window 
boxes and windmills. The streets are lined with bakeries, and a replica of the 
Little Mermaid fountain is located in town as is the Hans Christian Andersen 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic food and entertainment will be featured in the festival, and not only 
will clowns and jugglers wander the streets but so will the Danish performance 
trio of Linie 3, known in the States as The Three Danes. The singing and comedy 
group is currently one of Denmark's most popular acts. As well as wandering the 
streets, The Three Danes will perform Friday at 8 p.m. at the Sheraton Hotel, 
400 Alisal Road, 688-8000. Tickets are $10. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday starting at 3 p.m., a parade will weave through the village. For more 
information, call the visitors' bureau, 688-6144. 
</P>
<P>
Another celebration of cultural heritage, the Mexican Independence Day 
Festival, with authentic food, music and dance, will be held 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Saturday and Sunday in Santa Barbara's Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
And the culture and history of Southern California will be represented in "You 
Oughta Be in Pictures," a costume party from 7:30 to 10 p.m. Friday at Fess 
Parker's Red Lion Resort, 633 E. Cabrillo Blvd. Guests are encouraged to dress 
as their favorite Hollywood movie star or character. The party -- a benefit for 
the Santa Barbara County Chapters of the American Diabetes Assn. and the 
American Heart Assn. -- will offer prizes for the best costumes, a silent 
auction of celebrity memorabilia, a motion picture trivia contest, a band and 
dancing, and a buffet. Alice Faye, who starred in more than 40 movies in the 
1930s and '40s will be special guest. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the event are $60 per person. For more information, call 963-4194 
or 963-8862.

AMD Loses Patent Suit Over Chips: In a case that breaks new legal ground, 
Advanced Micro Devices has lost a patent infringement lawsuit brought by 
Brooktree Corp. of San Diego. A U.S. District Court jury found that AMD 
violated three of Brooktree's patents and also infringed on the company's 
rights to protect chip layout designs under a 1984 law. The Brooktree suit has 
been closely watched as the first major test of the Semiconductor Chip 
Protection Act, which made illegal the use of photographic techniques and other 
forms of copying chip designs.

OFFICIALS BLAST BOEING IMPORT OF B-2 WORKERS; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE FIRM'S CLAIM THAT IT COULDN'T FIND ENOUGH QUALIFIED PEOPLE 
LOCALLY IS CALLED 'IRRESPONSIBLE.' 
</P>

Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, along with other Southern California government 
leaders, harshly criticized Boeing Co. on Wednesday for importing about 450 
Seattle-based aerospace workers to Palmdale for temporary assignments on the 
B-2 Stealth bomber program. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Boeing Chairman Frank A. Shrontz, Bradley disputed Boeing's 
assertion that it could not locate enough qualified aircraft workers in 
Southern California and called the practice "extraordinarily wasteful." 
</P>
<P>
Under Boeing's contracts, the government pays the estimated $10-million cost 
for housing and transporting the workers. The Times reported Tuesday that 
Boeing had imported the workers under its B-2 bomber contract with Northrop, 
which is the prime contractor on the B-2 program. 
</P>
<P>
In another letter to Shrontz, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Panorama City) said 
he was "outraged" by Boeing's assertions about a lack of qualified workers in 
Los Angeles and that he finds the big aerospace company's attitude 
"irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles City Council is considering a motion introduced by 
Councilman Nate Holden that urges Boeing to reconsider its practice of 
importing workers and instead to hire Los Angeles residents. The motion is 
scheduled for a vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it hard to believe that in a city of well over 3 million people Boeing 
was unable to find 450 qualified individuals to fill the positions currently 
occupied by Seattle residents," Bradley wrote to Shrontz. "The problem is the 
reverse of Boeing's claim; in fact, Los Angeles has more well-trained, 
qualified and experienced aerospace workers than the industry can currently 
support." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said Los Angeles expects businesses to give something back to the 
community, and that in return for Boeing's use of the city's streets and 
utilities the company is "morally obligated to also use our labor force." 
</P>
<P>
Katz offered to coordinate a job fair for Boeing to fill the 450 Palmdale jobs. 
"If no one shows, . . . I owe you an apology. Otherwise, Boeing needs to make a 
public apology to Southern Californians." 
</P>
<P>
In a second letter, Katz assailed Boeing for hiring Los Angeles workers for 
jobs in Seattle at the same time it was transferring workers from Seattle to 
here. Katz questioned whether Boeing was using a loophole in federal 
regulations to subsidize non-competitive wages being paid to workers in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for comment about the letter to Shrontz, Boeing spokesman Paul Bender 
said only, "Mr. Shrontz isn't here." He said he expected that Boeing would 
collect some information and send a reply to Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said in an interview that the aerospace industry in Los Angeles is in a 
depression and that local unemployed workers sorely need the Boeing jobs. 
Holden said he had also criticized Boeing on Tuesday in a meeting with federal 
labor officials who were visiting Los Angeles.

Judge Denies Neil Bush's Request: Administrative Law Judge Daniel J. Davidson 
has denied Neil Bush's request to dismiss the government's case against him for 
alleged conflict of interest in his role as a former outside director of 
Denver-based Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. The judge rejected 
Bush's argument in his one-page order, saying it is not supported by existing 
regulations and case law.

THE REAL THING IN BRAND POWER IS COKE, GLOBAL SURVEY SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: CONSUMERS RATED PRODUCT SYMBOLS ON FAMILIARITY AND ESTEEM. THE

Coke is it. But Pepsi isn't -- the world's most powerful brand, that is. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's the conclusion of a survey of 9,000 consumers from America, 
Europe and Japan by Landor Associates, a San Francisco corporate identity firm. 
Sony ranked No. 2, and Mercedes-Benz rated third. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi placed 10th. And -- no surprise here -- among consumers in the Western 
United States, Disney rated No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
So, who cares? Plenty of marketing executives do. Rivals such as Coke and Pepsi 
can use surveys such as this to try to win new business -- anything from orders 
from a tiny grocer in southern France to those from a major fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing executives say brand awareness is among the most vital of all sales 
tools. What's more, as brands such as Pepsi and McDonald's (which ranked eighth 
worldwide) try to gain greater acceptance throughout the world, the brands that 
people use give them something in common. 
</P>
<P>
"A person in Los Angeles is similar to a person in Tokyo because of the brands 
they use," said Carlton Curtis, vice president of communications at Coca-Cola 
Co. "The two people might not speak the same language, but they may both drink 
Coke and use Sony Walkmans while listening to the same Madonna tape." 
</P>
<P>
The "Image Power" survey evaluated 6,000 brands. Each consumer was asked to 
make two ratings on each of 800 brands -- a rating on the basis of familiarity 
with the brand and a rating on the basis of regard for the brand. The 
combination of the two ratings helped determine the most "powerful" brands. 
Those participating in the survey included 5,000 consumers from America, 3,000 
from Europe and 1,000 from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
For those who think that patriotism is dead, bear in mind that American-made 
brands were consistently ranked tops by the American consumers surveyed. In 
fact, the Top 20 brands picked by Americans are all made by American firms. 
</P>
<P>
"The warm, fuzzy, non-glitzy brands seem to be playing best in America," said 
Don Casey, president and chief executive of Landor. The company came up with 
the name for Disney's Touchstone Pictures several years ago, and most recently 
created the graphic identity for General Motors' new Saturn division. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate image experts generally agree, however, that most successful brands 
can no longer focus on making it big in just one country. "There are still very 
few global brands," said Alan Siegel, chairman of Siegel &amp; Gale Inc., a New 
York-based corporate identity firm. "But as the world closes in, we are seeing 
the emergence of the need for the true global brand." 
</P>
<P>
Why did Coca-Cola rate better globally than Pepsi? "I'd say Coke has understood 
the essence of its product and communicated that image worldwide," said Casey. 
"Pepsi has taken a number of different marketing approaches -- and that rarely 
works." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Coca-Cola also happens to be a longtime Landor client. Coke also 
ranked No. 1 in a similar -- but less ambitious -- survey the company did in 
1988. Landor executives strongly deny that the company's working relationship 
with Coke tainted the survey results. They point out that only two of the 
companies in the Top 10 are clients. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi is hardly pleased with the results. "We don't take anything lightly when 
it comes to consumer preferences," said Leigh Curtain, manager of public 
relations at Pepsi-Cola Co. "You have to look at the methodology used in this 
survey -- which is a mystery to us." 
</P>
<P>
Several companies that suffered bad press the past year also did poorly in the 
survey. Of the 2,000 firms in the survey, American consumers ranked Exxon 444th 
in familiarity and 1,446th in esteem. Similarly, Perrier, which suffered a 
contamination scare earlier this year, ranked a lowly 1,396th in esteem. Both 
companies declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, where Exxon is sold under the Esso brand name, the company ranked 
20th in familiarity and 42nd in esteem. "Esso is not branded with almost having 
destroyed the coast of the state of Alaska," said a Landor executive who asked 
not to be named. "Exxon is."

Brazil to Open Computer Market: The Brazilian government said it would open its 
computer market to imports, ending a controversial policy adopted in 1984 to 
protect its fledgling computer industry that had prompted U.S. trade 
retaliation. Under the latest plan, imports of only 30 types of products, 
mainly in the area of microcomputers, will be prohibited until 1992. All other 
computer products will be allowed in, although import tariffs have not yet been 
set.

RALPHS AND LUCKY SCRAP FREQUENT-SHOPPER PLANS

<P>
A yearlong test program to reward loyal grocery shoppers with rebates or 
merchandise is being discontinued by the Ralphs and Lucky supermarket chains. 
</P>
<P>
Two Eastern supermarket chains are also ending limited testing of 
frequent-shopper programs run by Catalina Marketing Corp. of Anaheim. After an 
initial surge of customer enthusiasm, shoppers lost interest when they realized 
how slowly they were earning bonuses on the system, said Al Marasca, executive 
vice president of marketing for Ralphs Grocery Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We tested the program because it seemed to be a program that made sense," 
Marasca said. But compared to some of the chain's other promotional programs, 
"the customers told us that this was just not a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Customers at four Ralphs stores and four Lucky stores in Southern California 
were given plastic identification cards with a bar code on the back that 
identified the shoppers. A scanner links the customer to purchases made and 
rewards him or her with rebates or points toward the purchase of merchandise -- 
much as a frequent flyer piles up airline mileage toward free travel. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Granger of Catalina Marketing said the test was due to lapse at the end of 
September, after being extended three months. Also discontinuing the test are 
the Giant and Pathmark chains in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a test of some ideas," Granger said. "We've learned a lot, and 
they did also." 
</P>
<P>
Granger said the frequent-shopper program was a tiny part of Catalina 
Marketing's business. The company is best known for its electronic coupon 
dispensers that spit out cents-off coupons right at the register. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 3,300 grocery stores across the country doing checkout coupons as well 
as over 400 in Southern California," he said. "Quite frankly, it doesn't impact 
the rest of our business." 
</P>
<P>
The program at all four grocery chains, including operating costs and 
merchandise awarded, ran up a tab of roughly $1 million through March, he said.

CONSUMERS BUMPED FROM FLIGHTS CAN SUE

Airlines can be sued for damages for selling tickets that are subject to 
bumping when flights are overbooked, a federal court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
William D. West, a patent lawyer from Helena, Mont., planned a trip to Virginia 
on a Northwest Airlines flight in 1986 but was told the flight was overbooked. 
He put the trip off for two weeks and went to court with a lawsuit seeking 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that a federal ban on 
direct state regulation of airlines does not prevent a passenger from suing 
under ordinary state law for harm caused by airline practices. A U.S. District 
judge had previously dismissed the lawsuit, saying federal law barred it. 
</P>
<P>
"Selling nonrefundable tickets limits a traveler's ability to make changes but 
not the airline's ability . . . to switch to a smaller-size aircraft, 
increasing the chances of bumping," said Cornish Hitchcock of the Public 
Citizen Litigation Group, a Ralph Nader organization that helped represent 
West. 
</P>
<P>
West had been scheduled to arrive in Virginia at 9 p.m. and turned down an 
alternative flight that would have landed at 3 a.m. the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The airline was studying the ruling and had no comment, said its lawyer, Jon 
Metropoulos. 
</P>
<P>
The right to sue for overbooking was established in a 1976 Supreme Court 
decision, a case that started when Allegheny Airlines bumped Nader from a 
Washington-to-Hartford, Conn., flight. 
</P>
<P>
The 1978 federal airline deregulation law, which prohibited state laws 
"relating to rates, routes or services of any air carrier," bars only those 
state laws that purport to regulate airlines, said Appeals Court Judge Dorothy 
Nelson in the 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Many airlines offer free-trip coupons to passengers on overbooked flights. 
Federal law also entitles a bumped passenger to a refund of the ticket price, 
up to $200, if a substitute flight is more than an hour later than the original 
flight, or twice those amounts if more than two hours late.

GM, UAW TALKS HOLD RISKS FOR THE SOFTENING ECONOMY

<P>
The United Auto Workers union has an array of options open to it as national 
contract talks with General Motors Corp. enter their final hours. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the strategies, if carried out, carry potentially serious consequences 
for the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
In a nutshell, the union has three choices: Reach agreement before the current 
contract expires at midnight Friday, extend the current agreement beyond then 
or stage some kind of strike. 
</P>
<P>
It was difficult on Wednesday to assess the chances of an agreement before the 
deadline. The tone of negotiations since they began in mid-July has been mostly 
cordial, but some auto analysts have said for months that a strike against GM 
is likely. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW also is bargaining with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., but the 
union has put talks with those two companies on hold pending the outcome of the 
GM negotiations. In all, more than 450,000 active auto workers are covered by 
UAW contracts with the Big Three, each of which expires at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
With a strike fund of about $770 million, the union has the fiscal flexibility 
to take a large number of the 300,000 GM workers out of the company's plants 
for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
But the union may feel that such a labor bomb is unnecessary to demonstrate its 
discontent with GM. 
</P>
<P>
The company, like other auto makers, brings parts to its assembly plants within 
hours of the parts' being installed in vehicles. That means even a small strike 
can take on huge proportions as it dries up the parts pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW demonstrated that last month, when it staged a walkout involving about 
2,800 workers at GM's AC Rochester West plant in Flint, Mich., where fuel tanks 
and other parts of GM cars and trucks are made. 
</P>
<P>
When the supply of fuel tanks stopped, so did assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
The strike was seen as a signal of what the union could do to the auto maker if 
national talks broke down. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the six-day strike was over, seven assembly plants and portions of 
more than a dozen component factories had been shut down, temporarily idling 
more than 20,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever an assembly plant shuts down, layoffs ripple out. Depending on how 
long production at an assembly plant is interrupted, effects can be felt 
throughout the auto supplier industry, including plastic, glass, rubber and 
steel makers. 
</P>
<P>
Labor negotiations in the auto industry come as the economy is slowing down and 
predictions of a recession are growing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, an already weak economy slipped into recession when the UAW struck GM 
for 69 days, said Donald Ratajczak of the Economic Forecasting Center at 
Georgia State University in Atlanta. At that time, he said, GM played a much 
larger part in the U.S. economy than it does now. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it (GM) by itself isn't going to take down the economy," Ratajczak 
said Wednesday of this year's negotiations. "Although it's a negative. We're 
being hit by negatives all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
He said auto negotiations this year come "at a bad time when consumer 
psychology is hurting anyway. You start to run up the unemployment rate (from a 
strike) and you'll kill Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
A strike that slows production conceivably could help clear out dealers' lots 
of unsold cars, but inventories are already at optimum levels for this time of 
year, the dealers say. 
</P>
<P>
Auto dealers, struggling with slumping sales for nearly a year, have been 
decreasing their orders to increase their profits.

FOOTBALL: SOUTH GATE HIGH'S COACH GARY CORDRAY TEACHES CONFIDENCE IN SELF AND 
TEAMMATES. HE DOESN'T GRADUATE MAJOR-COLLEGE STARS, BUT HIS RAMS KEEP WINNING.

<P>
Desire and pride permeate football at South Gate High School and create an 
atmosphere that is all Coach Gary Cordray will ever require. 
</P>
<P>
The South Gate Rams, 25-1-1 the last two seasons, draw home crowds of 3,000 and 
enjoy support from the business community. Cordray, a fun-loving man who wears 
a Mickey Mouse watch and a whistle that sits on his protruding stomach, would 
never think of leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say this is sort of like the 'Happy Days' TV show," Cordray said last week 
as he stood in the center of the concrete campus. "I don't think it could be 
any better than right here. It's serene, you don't see a lot of stupidity. It's 
the best-kept secret, 'cause if anyone knew how good it was here they'd 
probably take my job, . . . 'cause there are a lot more smarter coaches than I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
Cordray will take an eight-season 52-30 record into Friday night's opening game 
with Wilson of Los Angeles. In 1988, the Rams were 14-0 and CIF city champions. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate's success has resulted mainly from tight defense played by 
youngsters whose desire and togetherness overcome lack of size. The repertoire 
of offensive plays covers just half of a small chalkboard in an office beneath 
the stadium bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the school is Hispanic, so most of us get along," said senior 
Steve Martinez, the team's best defensive player. "They always say South Gate 
doesn't have any size, but everybody is together. We are a team of unity. It 
takes heart to win, and that's what South Gate has." 
</P>
<P>
Cordray, 44, grew up in the Appalachian town of McConnelsville, Ohio, "thinking 
that on Friday night, football was the most important thing in town." 
</P>
<P>
He said Ohio State's Woody Hayes was like a god to him, though Cordray ended up 
being a punter at Bowling Green. 
</P>
<P>
He knew he wanted to keep that football atmosphere always. Unable to find it at 
L.A.'s Washington High, his previous school, Cordray helped create it in South 
Gate, where football is so popular that he said the team can get what it needs 
from the Optimist, Kiwanis and Rotary clubs. 
</P>
<P>
A weekly Rams football show on the local cable TV station has had up to 25 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
"The business people here think the high school is outstanding," said Cordray, 
who lives in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Auto dealer Pete Ellis is one of the contributors. "Some very influential 
people in town are behind (the team), supporting it financially and with their 
time," he said. "This is a very proud community with a tremendous amount of 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
A 300-member booster club is headed by Henry Gonzalez, a former city 
councilman. "The team pulls the community together," he said. "Everybody's so 
proud of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
A water tower looms at the east end of the Rams' campus stadium, but a sign on 
the gym near the west end gets the players' attention. It reads: "South Gate 
High Ram Pride." 
</P>
<P>
"See those words?" Cordray asked. "That's what I believe in: South Gate Ram 
Pride. Our kids see that when they come out here, and we talk about it every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
The pride penetrates so deeply that the players also paint the yard lines on 
the field and paint off any graffiti that might be on campus buildings. 
</P>
<P>
More than 130 boys tried out for the varsity this summer, Cordray said, twice 
the number of candidates his first season. The 80 who won uniforms were doing 
jumping jacks, shouting, "One! Two! Three!" with crisp enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
That spirit pleased Cordray. "Our bench is alive all the time," he said. "We're 
chatterin', cheerin' it up, guys are screamin' and hollerin'. We don't need 
cheerleaders, bands and all that kind of stuff. If we can't read that sign up 
there, we're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Red helmets lay on the grass as the Rams stretched. Cordray walked along the 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy right here is so low off the ground, I swear, if moles could tackle, 
he'd be the best ballplayer in the world," Cordray said as he came to senior 
Rene Portugal. "How tall are you? Really?" 
</P>
<P>
"5-3." 
</P>
<P>
Cordray smiled. "In your cleats, with your helmet on?" 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the players were small. This season's team is one of the biggest 
Cordray has had. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's the guy we call House," Cordray said, pointing out 6-foot-3 lineman 
Carlos Nunez. "House started at 316 in 10th grade, now he's gonna be playing 
this year at 280. He's trim, lean and mean. He's going to play some hell on 
some defensive backs." 
</P>
<P>
Although Cordray was compassionate toward his players at the practice, he could 
also be tough, living up to his reputation as a disciplinarian. During the 
championship season two years ago, Cordray benched several of his starters in 
one game for breaking rules. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate does not produce future stars: Just three players in Cordray's eight 
years have gone on to play at four-year colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"What we try to do is get a kid who's not very good and make him as good as 
possible, so his expectations of himself go beyond his dreams," Cordray said. 
"We don't tell them they're going to be college or professional players. We 
tell them, 'This is going to be your last hurrah, but we're going to get you to 
play like the pros do or your favorite college team does.' " 
</P>
<P>
When they leave South Gate, the coach said, they still have that dream of 
making it somewhere else, but eventually they realize that they are too small 
or too slow. 
</P>
<P>
Cordray said a high percentage of his players graduate, which is his main goal: 
"If they can come out of here one step ahead of the rest of the general 
population when they take that job application, then I think we really have 
succeeded in our football program. It's not numbers going to college." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the players return within a few years of graduation to attend practice, 
a game or to let the coaches know whether they're in the military, working or 
going to school. 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as 300-pound former center Rudy Fortiz, become assistant coaches. 
"Rudy's my offensive line coach, equipment manager, first-aid man and also my 
eating buddy," Cordray said. 
</P>
<P>
A family atmosphere is evident. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday night the booster club held a spaghetti dinner for the team at 
which the coaches talked to the players' parents about equipment, treating 
injuries, academics and the pluses and minuses of football. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the players have brothers who played for South Gate. Among them is Jose 
Terrones, a ninth-grader whose brother, Adrian, was on the 1985 team. 
</P>
<P>
"How come you want to play football for South Gate?" Cordray asked Terrones as 
they stood on the edge of the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know . . . to make my mom and dad happy for me," Terrones answered 
shyly. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah? How about yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
"Me too." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah? What do you have here?" 
</P>
<P>
"South Gate High School Ram pride." 
</P>
<P>
Cordray hustled back onto the field to supervise a kickoff return drill. He 
does not view what he is doing as work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm country, I don't know anything else, this is it," he said.

DEAD RINGER: Nowadays, who would hire a lobbyist who looks just like Saddam 
Hussein? Lots of people, hopes Jerry Haleva, above, longtime aide to former 
Orange County state Sen. William Campbell and now a fledgling Sacramento 
lobbyist. . . . Haleva so resembles the Iraqi leader that he's been signed by a 
Hollywood look-alike agency in hopes of a movie role. Since Hussein became big 
news, people stare, Haleva says, but so far his resemblance has caused no 
problems. "But if he drops one chemical weapon, I lose the mustache." Jeffrey

POLICE SAY DEATH OF 4 WAS MURDER-SUICIDE BY WOMAN

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After an extensive and often puzzling weeklong investigation, police said 
Wednesday that a pregnant Vietnamese woman fatally shot her two young children 
and ex-boyfriend and then turned the gun on herself. 
</P>
<P>
"We're classifying this case as a murder-suicide," Costa Mesa Police Capt. 
Thomas Lazar said of one of the city's worst murder cases ever. "Our victims 
are the two children and the male adult." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say they have not been able to determine why the woman, Hanh Thi 
Duong, 25, shot and killed her ex-boyfriend, Oanh Van Le, 30; her 7-year-old 
son, Thang Quoc Nguyen, and 4-year-old daughter, Lan Ngoc Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of all four victims were found in Duong's Baker Street apartment on 
Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Cuc Thi Nguyen, Duong's 46-year-old mother, said Wednesday that she discovered 
the bodies and alerted a neighbor, who called police. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter and the children were the only reason for my living," she said. 
"Now, it's like I'm dead but not yet buried." 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said her daughter had a stormy relationship with Le, who had recently 
moved out of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said Le "had been beating her (daughter) for the last several months." 
Police, however, said there was no evidence that Duong had been beaten and no 
sign of a struggle at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
The mother said she had asked Le to move out of her daughter's apartment two 
weeks before the slayings, and that her daughter was packing to move when the 
killings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she was in the process of moving out to get away from him. And in her 
moment of anger and frustration, she took the final act," Nguyen said, speaking 
through an interpreter. "I think my daughter felt that life was hopeless. With 
all the kids, she's pregnant, no job." 
</P>
<P>
Le's relatives, who asked not to be named, said that he loved the woman and the 
children and had repeatedly gone back to Duong's apartment and begged to be 
taken back but was spurned. An uncle described Le as a gentle person who 
"couldn't stay mad more than five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the modest apartment after the mother peered through a 
broken window and saw her daughter's legs as she lay on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the two-bedroom apartment, police found Duong and Le on the living room 
floor. An undisclosed type of firearm was found between them. The bodies of the 
children were discovered in bedroom, each dead from a single gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the couple's problems, relatives said they were still in love. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter was still in love with him," Nguyen said. "She did not want him to 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
Le's uncle, with whom Le stayed after he moved out of Duong's apartment, said 
his family was trying to get the couple to reconcile their differences. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he loved the children very much and he wanted to come back and 
apologize to her and work it out," the uncle said. "Our family wanted to help 
him go back with her." 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, her daughter and the children left Vietnam by boat in 1985, leaving the 
children's father behind. They ended up in a Malaysian refugee camp and settled 
in Southern California 3 1/2 years ago, Nguyen said, adding that the family had 
not been in touch with Duong's husband since they left Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said her daughter had been on welfare but also had held odd jobs from 
time to time. Le worked as a drill-press operator in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of her death, Nguyen said her daughter was pregnant with Le's 
child. Police said she was 24 to 28 weeks pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the investigation was hampered because the victims' relatives and 
friends did not contact police with information. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to run down these people real easily," Lazar said. "We've 
run into some cultural problems. . . . They did not come in and volunteer any 
information to us." 
</P>
<P>
Lazar noted that his department's first contact with Le's family came when 
police found them driving his car on their way to the funeral home in 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"These were very closed-mouth people and I don't think they shared a lot with 
even their own relatives," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
When relatives were finally interviewed, they told police that Duong and Le had 
an "on-and-off again" relationship and were living together in the apartment 
until Le moved out Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
"They were moving apart," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
After seven days of sifting through physical evidence and confronting difficult 
cultural barriers, investigators were finally "confident" that the case was a 
murder-suicide, Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the keys to arriving at that conclusion was that was the apartment was 
locked from the inside. In addition, there was no indication of a robbery, and 
the murder weapon was found on the floor between the man, who had been shot 
several times, and the woman, who died of a single gunshot wound, Lazar said, 
adding that fingerprint and ballistic tests are still being reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Before the shooting, Duong had been preparing to move in with her her mother, 
while Le was "going to set up house with his parents that were coming in from 
Hong Kong," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they do not know why Le was in Duong's apartment on the day 
of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives were further "puzzled" in their investigation by a broken window in 
the rear of the apartment and the fact that Le had no wallet on him. Lazar said 
investigators were looking into the possibility that somebody entered the 
apartment through the window but have not been able to find any evidence to 
support that theory. Le's wallet was later found his car. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors in the 1300 block of Baker Street told police that they heard noises 
like breaking glass and "pounding sounds" about 7:30 a.m. on the day of 
shooting. Police believe the noises were gunshots. Lazar declined to say how 
many rounds were fired or to whom the gun was registered. He also did not 
comment on which victims were shot first. 
</P>
<P>
Lazar said investigators were withholding some information "just in case 
something turns up" in the future that may lead to reopening the investigation.

HEAT AND SMOG JOIN FORCES FOR 9TH DAY IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California suffered Wednesday under the ninth day of a merciless 
plague of heat and smog that has obliterated skylines, sent a few disgruntled 
tourists packing for home and left some residents literally gasping for clean 
air. 
</P>
<P>
However, Orange County escaped the worst of the heat and smog that has 
smothered downtown Los Angeles. Air quality was generally good Wednesday except 
in La Habra and El Toro, where it was deemed "moderate," said Claudia Keith, 
spokeswoman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we were going to have worse air than we did," Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the forecast is for unhealthful air in much of the county today, 
including La Habra, Anaheim, Los Alamitos and Costa Mesa, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
However, cooler temperatures and smog-busting breezes are expected beginning 
Friday, bringing with them a cooler, clearer weekend, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're probably seeing the forerunner of a cleansing, cleaning trend," Keith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in Orange County were only slightly cooler than on Tuesday. The 
mercury hit 97 degrees in Anaheim, 92 in Santa Ana, 91 in Irvine and 90 in El 
Toro. Beach cities were more pleasant, with highs of 81 in Dana Point, 88 in 
San Juan Capistrano and only 73 in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"(Today) will be just as bad, but Friday things will improve and will continue 
to improve through the weekend," said Marty McKewon, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles residents were not so lucky. Downtown visibility has been limited 
to a few miles, with the San Gabriel Mountains lost in a sea of brown haze. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions did improve slightly Wednesday. No first-stage alerts were called, 
but the air was declared "unhealthful" in 12 of the 34 air-monitoring areas of 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, including normally clear West 
Los Angeles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Civic Center posted a high of 94, the ninth consecutive day of 
90-degree-plus weather. Inland valleys fared even worse, with highs reaching 
105 in Riverside and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the region, playground games have been canceled and pedestrians have 
protected themselves from the unrelenting sun and contaminated air with 
parasols and wet handkerchiefs. Those who could avoided the smog by staying 
indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Lewis was not so lucky. His work as a garbage truck driver took him to what 
was arguably the most unpleasant place to be on a hot, smoggy day -- high atop 
500 feet of trash at the Sunshine Canyon Landfill north of Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
As a light wind kicked up a cloud of dust amid the sea of disposable diapers 
and plastic trash bags, Lewis watched bulldozers cover his load of garbage with 
a layer of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep the trash covered up pretty good, so you don't have too much 
stench," said Lewis, 56. "It's the smog and the fumes from all these trucks 
that bother me. . . . The heat isn't that bad. It's nothing like what the 
fellas are suffering in Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
What's causing the hellish weather? 
</P>
<P>
Joe Cassmassi, a weather forecaster with the AQMD, described the conditions in 
the atmosphere above Southern California as "worst-case meteorology." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, temperatures near the 100-degree mark break up the inversion layer 
that holds pollutants close to the ground, he said. But this week, a 
high-pressure system centered over San Diego has kept the inversion layer 
intact, leading to the unusual combination of smog and near-100-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
Even the usually pleasant beach communities have been affected by the smog 
siege, Cassmassi said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to get out of L.A. pretty much, and even out of Orange County, to get 
away from the smog," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For out-of-towners visiting Southern California, Wednesday's dirty air and heat 
seemed a far cry from the pleasant, post-card vistas they had seen in the 
travel agent's office back home. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Steven, a 21-year-old tourist from Scotland, sat in the shade of a kiosk 
at the main entrance to the Huntington Library in San Marino, resting after a 
midday walk that unexpectedly became a desertlike trek. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost unbearable," she said. "I expected brilliant sunshine and clear 
skies. It's been kind of a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Prigatamo, a volunteer who collects donations for the library, offered the 
weary tourist a glass of water. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time Prigatamo had rescued a pedestrian from the heat 
wave. Earlier in the day, a Swiss woman and her child approached Prigatamo's 
kiosk. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her, 'You walked all the way from Switzerland in this heat? That's 
crazy,' " Prigatamo said, laughing. "But seriously," he added, "another person 
walked from the Norton Simon Museum (in Pasadena). Now that's a long way." 
</P>
<P>
In some San Gabriel Valley communities, intermittent first-stage smog alerts 
during the first week of school forced officials to limit playground 
activities. And even when the smog was not that bad, children seemed to be less 
enthusiastic about learning new yard games, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
Most Angelenos know that coping with the smog means adapting one's activities 
to the ebb and flow of the nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Gardening, jogging or any other outdoor activity should be reserved for the 
hours of the early evening, when the smog dissipates and the hint of a marine 
breeze appears in even the most remote inland valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Those forced to work outdoors have developed survival strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Postal Service letter carrier Lester Santiago, 55, followed his usual routine 
Wednesday to keep from passing out from heatstroke on his Pasadena route. 
</P>
<P>
"Just before I leave for work in the morning I have 1 1/2 glasses of apple 
juice and a glass of water," Santiago said. "I have another glass of water at 
the office just before I start my route. . . . By the end of the day, I've had 
about six glasses of water." 
</P>
<P>
The heat wave is expected to end this weekend, forecasters say, as the 
high-pressure system over San Diego moves eastward. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be slowly cooling down each day from here on out," said McKewon. 
"There's a sign that it's ending." 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures should dip below the 90s by Friday, McKewon said.

CITY ASKS 10% CUT IN USE OF WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To avoid a shortage of water during the current drought, the City Council has 
requested a voluntary 10% reduction in water use citywide. 
</P>
<P>
The city passed a resolution asking residents and businesses to avoid watering 
lawns during the hot part of the day, to check for and repair leaks promptly, 
and to use buckets of water instead of hoses to wash vehicles. Also, 
restaurants are requested to serve water only on request. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution stated that if voluntary measures do not reduce water use 
enough, mandatory steps could be implemented.

TEEN ARRESTED IN BOWLING ALLEY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of setting the Aug. 11 fire 
that burned down the Maple Lanes Bowling Alley, causing an estimated $500,000 
in damage. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Fire Department officials on Wednesday said the youth, who was 
arrested Tuesday, is a city resident and former employee of the bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the arrest of the youth, whose name was not being released 
because he is a minor, culminated a month of investigation by Garden Grove 
police and the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out at 2:30 a.m. on Aug. 11, gutted the bowling alley. No 
one was injured in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
According to fire officials, the youth came to police headquarters on Tuesday 
for questioning about the fire and was arrested after the session. He was being 
held at the county's Juvenile Hall.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STUDENTS DO WRITE THING FOR MARINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the student body of MacArthur Fundamental Intermediate School, the Persian 
Gulf crisis has become a history lesson unfolding before their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
But the students also have become personally involved by writing letters to 
local Marines who have been sent to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 letters will be hand-delivered to the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station on Friday afternoon by Principal Thomas Reasin and several student 
government leaders. They will then be delivered overseas, Assistant Principal 
Jane Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
"This project makes current events come alive in the classroom," Russo said. 
"These kids are going to know where the Persian Gulf is geographically and are 
not going to forget where any of those countries are. They are going to know 
the situation and understand it." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the letters, students will enclose pictures of themselves and 
will provide the Marines with self-addressed, stamped envelopes and paper with 
the hopes of establishing correspondence.

<P>
BUILDING BAN NEAR DISNEYLAND RETAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that left both council members and most local developers each feeling 
like they got the bad end of the deal, the City Council extended for 90 days a 
moratorium on building around the Disneyland area, balking at a one-year freeze 
that had been recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of council supported the longer building ban, which city planners 
had recommended, but voted for the less severe moratorium after Mayor Fred 
Hunter and Councilman William D. Ehrle made it clear that they would not 
support the longer plan. Any urgency ordinance needs four of the five council 
votes to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Anaheim has so much to lose," said Councilman Irv Pickler, who 
voted for the 90-day freeze, but was in favor of a one-year moratorium. "I 
think the people of Anaheim deserve the best, and this is just a shame, it's 
just pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
The Disney Development Co. had also supported the longer freeze, though 
representatives declined to comment on how the shorter ban would affect their 
plans to develop a second theme park in Anaheim next to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been supportive of the city's planning efforts for a long time," said 
Kerry Scott Hunnewell, director of development for the Walt Disney Co. "As we 
see it, the only way . . . is to continue the moratorium." 
</P>
<P>
Council approved the ordinance Tuesday on a 4-1 vote with Ehrle opposing. 
</P>
<P>
City planners had urged passage of a one-year freeze so that they could 
continue studying ways to improve traffic and other problems in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Ralph Wilkerson, president of the Melodyland church near Disneyland, 
spoke against the one-year moratorium at the public hearing Tuesday night. He 
cited the difficulty of selling property during a building freeze as a 
detriment to his organization's ability to do its business. 
</P>
<P>
Most developers at the hearing said that a total repeal of what began in May as 
only a 30-day moratorium would have been preferable to the 90-day extension. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time there's any kind of artificial controls, it makes it difficult," said 
Frank Elfend, a local developer. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency ordinance was first enacted May 1, and was extended for 90 days 
in mid-June. This was the last time under state government code that the city 
could extend the moratorium. But city officials said the council might try to 
use its authority as a charter city to extend the moratorium when it expires in 
December. LISA MASCARO

'WILD AND CRAZY KIDS' STAR IN PLAY

Nine-year-old Robert Veale got a taste of show biz Wednesday, but he wasn't 
quite sure what to make of it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun," said the fourth-grader from Mabel L. Pendleton Elementary School. 
"But . . . it's boring, all that waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Veale and 45 other students from the Buena Park School District got a lesson in 
patience as contestants on "Wild and Crazy Kids," a popular show on cable-TV's 
Nickelodeon. The no-holds-barred game and sports show puts kids in wacky 
situations and lets them have fun. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, the center ring of the Medieval Times Dinner Tournament 
was transformed into a sound stage as the third- and fourth-graders squared-off 
against a giant "Earthball" in a medieval version of dodge ball. Donning bright 
purple, yellow and pink "crazy kids" T-shirts, the youngsters tried to grab 
flags from the hosts before being tagged out. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a great learning experience," said Assistant Supt. Sandra Barry while 
watching the theme dinner house's production crew give instructions to the 
children. "The kids are realizing what goes into making the show. . . . They 
understand now it is a long process." 
</P>
<P>
The show featuring the Buena Park students is the last in a series of 26 
episodes that have been taped all around Southern California. The show, which 
airs every Sunday at 12:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., features children in a variety 
of challenging situations including everything from playing basketball on 
donkeys to trying to hold colored water in a glass while riding on a roller

In the afternoon segment, the fifth- and sixth-grade students from Pendleton 
participated in a King Arthur-like jousting match with foam swords. 
</P>
<P>
Since hitting the airways, "Wild and Crazy Kids," has slowly climbed the rating 
charts to become one of the most popular shows on the channel, writer Phil 
Gurin said. What makes it popular is that the emphasis is not on competition, 
he said. "No prizes are awarded at the end. It's just real kids having real 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
Although the three-hour taping was trying for many of the weary youngsters, 
everything went relatively smoothly, said Richard Crystal, the show's producer. 
</P>
<P>
Some overzealous participants who failed to sit down after being tagged out did 
create a bit of a problem, Crystal said. But it was quickly remedied. "I told 
them they would be seen cheating on national television." 
</P>
<P>
The show featuring the students from Buena Park is expected to air at the end 
of December. LYNDA NATALI

MEASURES FAIL AFTER DEBATE ON RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Shortly before she was elected mayor, Sally Anne Sheridan said she would bring 
peace to City Hall by practicing a less-divisive form of leadership. The City 
Council majority, led by Mayor Larry Agran, had created political rifts with 
the public over issues he supported, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But more than a dozen speakers at Tuesday night's City Council meeting accused 
Sheridan and council ally Barry J. Hammond, elected in June, of driving a wedge 
between residents by trying to bring religion into city business. 
</P>
<P>
For more than four hours, residents and council members debated the merits of 
measures providing for a Christmas tree in the City Hall plaza and for 
beginning council meetings with a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures failed, although the council voted unanimously to create a 
special task force to study opening the plaza to holiday celebrations 
throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers, including rabbis and Christian pastors, spoke against the 
measures, saying a Christmas tree and "silent invocation" would inject religion 
into government, discomfiting residents who do not share the majority's 
religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hammond, though, said a "holiday tree" would be a symbol of the 
season and would not endorse or promote religion. 
</P>
<P>
Several Irvine residents disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, a tree is only a symbol of religion," said Coralia Maier, 17, a student 
at Woodbridge High School. "And I would like to remind the City Council that 
not all of us share this religion." 
</P>
<P>
"Please don't try to make this a secular issue," said Robin Kale, 36, a data 
processing consultant. "A tree with lights on it in December is for a holiday, 
and it's not mine." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman William A. (Art) Bloomer, who voted with Councilwoman Paula Werner 
to defeat the Christmas tree and invocation plans, said both issues are better 
left alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is time to get rid of the divisiveness," Bloomer said. "It is not 
the time for us to get involved in religious issues at City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
But Hammond, who supported both measures, said the issues were not divisive. 
Instead, he said, a small number of residents who oppose the current council 
majority were trying to defeat the measures in order to create issues for 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
While some of the speakers at Tuesday's meeting were expressing genuine 
opposition to the measures, most were simply voicing political opposition to 
the new council members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a group of people who, in my mind, are trying to make an issue out of 
anything they can," Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said he suggested starting council meetings with a silent invocation 
because at least 50 residents have asked him to bring up the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Most city councils in Orange County begin meetings with a short 
nondenominational prayer. By adding a silent invocation, Irvine would be doing 
nothing unusual, Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not whether we can offend anybody," Hammond said. "It's what's 
the policy for the city that will offend the least number of people." TOM

UNION OFFICIAL DENIES PETERS PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A teachers' union official has denied there was a union "conspiracy" to oust 
Diana Peters as superintendent of the Huntington Beach City School District 
earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The official, Jim Harlan, said that only the school board knows why Peters was 
forced to resign, and he challenged the school board to make the reasons 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Harlan, executive director of the West Orange County United Teachers, made his 
remarks in response to a letter sent by residents to the grand jury. The Aug. 
31 letter accused Harlan and the teachers' union of pressuring the board to 
force Peters to resign. 
</P>
<P>
The authors of the letter -- Huntington Beach residents Haydee V. Tillotson, 
Merle Moshiri and Henry H. Goldman -- urged the grand jury to investigate 
Harlan, the teachers' union and the school board. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . It appears that (the) school board may have been influenced by the 
teachers' union and the union's director, Jim Harlan, when it suddenly moved to 
buy out Supt. Diana Peters' contract," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
The school board on July 25 voted to give Peters $126,952 in exchange for her 
resignation from a contract that was supposed to run until June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Harlan on Tuesday noted that the panel has never publicly explained why it 
decided to buy out Peters' contract only eight months after praising her and 
extending her contract to the maximum permitted by law. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it was the union pressure," Harlan said. "I think it was 
something private between her (Peters) and the school board. To get the truth, 
maybe we should challenge Diana Peters to sign a letter of release and get the 
school board to release the exact details of why it wanted to dismiss her. 
Maybe the truth should come out." 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Barlow, president of the school board, on Tuesday said she and other 
board members cannot elaborate on Peters' departure. Barlow noted that the 
board has said only that Peters resigned because of "philosophical 
differences." She refused further comment. Peters has also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
The signed agreement between Peters and the school board contains a gag order 
that restricts both sides from saying "disparaging or derogatory remarks, 
comments or statements regarding each other." BILL BILLITER

BEACH SLAYING SUSPECT 'WAS LIVING IN FEAR OF HIS LIFE,' FATHER SAYS;

ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE.

The parents of a Laguna Niguel youth who allegedly shot to death a Capistrano 
Beach man said Wednesday that their son is "remorseful" but insisted that he 
acted in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
"He was living in fear of his life," said Don Steffens, father of the Dana 
Hills High School junior accused of murdering Robert James Elliott, 18. "He was 
constantly beaten up, and there was nothing I or the police could do. So he 
took matters in his own hands." 
</P>
<P>
Charged with murder and assault with a deadly weapon, Christian Aaron Steffens 
appeared for his detention hearing before Juvenile Court Judge C. Robert 
Jameson. Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathi Harper recommended that the 16-year-old be 
tried as an adult. Jameson is expected to rule on the recommendation when the 
hearing resumes Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Chris Collins, who was appointed Wednesday to represent 
Christian Steffens, requested a postponement, saying he needed additional time 
to review the case. 
</P>
<P>
The killing occurred about 1 p.m. Saturday after an argument between the two at 
the Dana Strand beach in Dana Point. Witnesses said that they had argued, that 
Steffens walked away and that Elliott pursued him. 
</P>
<P>
Steffens drew a gun, turned and pulled the trigger, witnesses said. The gun 
didn't fire, but he pulled the trigger a second time, striking Elliott in the 
chest, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Standing outside the courthouse, Don Steffens spoke to reporters for the first 
time since his son's arrest last Saturday and disputed reports that the killing 
stemmed from a broken window in Elliott's truck. Elliott's friends said 
Christian Steffens had reportedly smashed the window with a baseball bat about 
three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot more than a $50 (window)," Don Steffens said. "It is what happens 
when youths break away from 'wannabe skinheads.' They kept following 
(Christian) as if they were on a recruitment drive." 
</P>
<P>
Don Steffens said his son had been beaten "numerous times" during the last year 
by Elliott and his friends. He said Christian had belonged to a group of 
"wannabe skinheads" who hang out on beaches in South County. 
</P>
<P>
Don Steffens said the beatings of his son intensified during the last few 
weeks, adding that the wall near his son's room had been shot at. The father 
said he made a few reports to police about the harassment but that no action 
was taken. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Christian's (complaints) were a typical teen-ager's 
over-exaggeration," Don Steffens said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Robert Rivas, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department, said 
investigators are looking into a report that Christian Steffens was beaten by 
youths who live in the area. He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott's parents and close friends have denied that the victim belonged to a 
skinhead gang or that he had threatened the accused. They maintain that Elliott 
simply wanted restitution for the window the young Steffens had broken. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Whittaker, a pastor with the Calvary Chapel of Capistrano Beach, said 
Wednesday that Elliott was an active member of the church's youth group. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to miss his involvement," Whittaker said. "He enjoyed coming here, 
and it was nice having him around." 
</P>
<P>
Christian Steffens appeared in court wearing a blue T-shirt, blue elastic 
trousers and blue jogging shoes. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Cynthia Steffens, 38, said that her son was "remorseful" and that 
he had been placed on a suicide watch at Juvenile Hall in Orange. The parents 
said they did not know where their son obtained the gun that he allegedly used 
to kill Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
Don Steffens said that since the shooting he had moved out of his Laguna Niguel 
apartment with his wife and 11-year-old son because he feared reprisals. 
Steffens said he would not return to the neighborhood "for the safety of my 
family."

STATE SUPREME COURT REFUSES TO HEAR LAGUNA NIGUEL'S BID FOR MONARCH BEACH

<P>
The city of Laguna Niguel has been dealt a setback in its three-year battle to 
regain control over a tax-rich strip of Monarch Beach with a state Supreme 
Court decision not to hear its legal challenge against Dana Point, city 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager John Donlevy said that city officials were notified by 
David Cosgrove, acting attorney for the city in the long-running case, that the 
state's highest court decided not to act on the Laguna Niguel appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Donlevy said he did not know exactly when the court denied hearing the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"All the important players in this heard about it today," Donlevy said. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute is over a 1.5-mile-long stretch of beachfront property between 
Selva Road and Three Arch Bay. Residents of the area, which was initially part 
of the unincorporated planned community of Laguna Niguel, voted in a 1987 
special election to join the Dana Point cityhood effort. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, Laguna Niguel officials claimed that the Orange County Local 
Agency Formation Commission erred by only allowing voters in the 1,400-acre 
area to choose whether they should break from Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel officials argued that all Laguna Niguel residents should have 
voted, since loss of the property, which includes the posh Ritz-Carlton hotel, 
would affect the financial future of the planned community. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the suit, Laguna Niguel was not yet a city but became one in 
December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
During the cityhood campaign, Laguna Niguel City Council candidates promised 
they would fight to regain the property, which includes Monarch Bay, Monarch 
Terrace, Monarch Beach, Emerald Ridge and Niguel Shores. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point officials praised the court decision and said they hoped the two 
cities could work together in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I am real pleased," said City Councilwoman Eileen Krauss. "It removes the 
cloud (over the disputed property) and allows the city of Laguna Niguel to move 
on with its business. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had this hope, and I think it distracted them," she continued. "I'm 
hoping (the decision) improves the rapport between the two cities. It's hard to 
work with someone when they're suing you." 
</P>
<P>
Some Laguna Niguel officials refused to admit defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course the temporary loss of the coastal strip is a severe disappointment 
to the tens of thousands of Laguna Niguel residents who have counted on this 
area as being part of our permanent planned community," City Councilman Paul M. 
Christiansen said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on the possibility of the city appealing the decision to 
the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
The court decision is the latest political blow to the 26-square-mile city. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Laguna Niguel has been mired in a controversy over a land deal that 
allowed construction of new homes in an area designated for parkland. And the 
council will consider on Oct. 3 a residents' initiative that would block a 
controversial development of a pristine ridgeline that overlooks South Laguna 
and the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hollingsworth, president of the Monarch Beach Civic Assn., said he hoped 
Laguna Niguel officials put the dispute with Dana Point behind them. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this now will redirect Laguna Niguel's attention to their city 
problems," he said. "I hope we all can now bury the hatchet."

Secretary of the Army Michael P. W. Stone said Wednesday that his troops are 
ready for combat in the Persian Gulf if economic and political sanctions aren't 
enough to free Kuwait from the grasp of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to more than 500 members of the Orange County World Affairs 
Council, Stone described operation Desert Shield as a "extraordinary 
achievement" in the mobilization of military forces and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a strong foe, Iraq," Stone said. "It has a large army with an active and 
large repertoire of equipment. But I have no doubts about our ability to 
execute whatever orders the President gives us." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the United States' commitment to assembling a massive military force in 
the Persian Gulf, Stone said the U.S. Army will be getting smaller in the years 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
He said the total number of people serving in the U.S. armed forces would be 
reduced from about 735,000 to somewhere between 550,000 and 600,000 in the 
coming years, in order to compensate for the changing political climate 
throughout the world.

JOHNSON'S OK PUTS ALL RAMS IN FOLD; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: TIGHT END AGREES TO A TWO-YEAR CONTRACT. HE COULD BE ACTIVATED 
FOR SUNDAY'S GAME AT TAMPA BAY.

As was evident during Sunday's 36-24 loss to the Green Bay Packers, the Rams 
need all the help they can get if they hope to revive their preseason 
expectations and challenge for a Super Bowl appearance in January. 
</P>
<P>
The season started too soon for this team, which has been hampered by holdouts 
and injuries, but at least the Rams will travel on Friday to Tampa, Fla., with 
a full contingent. Wednesday, tight end Damone Johnson, the team's final 
holdout who had been out of camp 50 days, agreed to a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it's safe to say Johnson settled for 
considerably less than the $1.1 million, two-year deal he had sought. The Rams 
were offering $575,000 for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a compromise on both parts," Johnson said. "You know, they're happy 
and, well, I'm playing again." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a six-year veteran who attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, has been the 
starting tight end the past two seasons, with 67 receptions for 498 yards and 
11 touchdowns during that span. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will get a roster exemption for Johnson, and Coach John Robinson said 
he will make a decision on Friday about activating Johnson for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"Damone's a good receiver who understands the subtleties of getting open at the 
tight end position," Robinson said after Wednesday's practice. "He was here 
when this pass offense was put in. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks big and fast and healthy. He caught two passes (in practice) and fell 
down on both, but I think he's in pretty good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who last year held out until the day before the final exhibition game 
and then played the entire regular-season opener at Atlanta, said he has been 
working out by running in the park with his pit bull, Rock. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very frustrating since about the second week of camp on, but that's 
part of the business," Johnson said. "If you want to be a football player, you 
have to deal with the negotiation process." 
</P>
<P>
Negotiating with the Rams' front office can often be a one-sided game of give 
and take, but Johnson said a couple of recent phone conversations he had with 
Jay Zygmunt, the Rams' senior vice president, were "pretty productive" and 
provided the foundation for an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wins when you start missing games," Johnson said. "I'm in the business 
of playing football and it's bad business if I'm missing games. 
</P>
<P>
"You never want to lose this much time, but some things you have to do for 
yourself. At least I got a raise." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
One person in the Southland who isn't complaining about the heat these days is 
Coach John Robinson. He hopes the weather will help prepare the Rams prepare 
for the 90-degree, high-humidity conditions they are expected to face on Sunday 
in Tampa Stadium. "I'm grateful we've had some heat here," Robinson said. "I 
think we'll all get off the airplane not quite as much in shock. But (the 
weather) is certainly an issue." Robinson said he plans to keep a close eye on 
his players and rotate personnel. "Once you get overheated, when you get all 
flushed like that, it's not a 'Give me five minutes and I'll be all right 
thing,' " Robinson said. "It's more like 'Give me two hours in a cold shower.' 
" . . . Robinson says running back Cleveland Gary, who missed the entire 
exhibition schedule with a lower-back injury, will be a part of the game plan 
against Tampa Bay. How, exactly, will he be used? "Interspersed in an organized 
fashion with (Curt Warner and Gaston Green), catering to the one who's running 
the best," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay Coach Ray Perkins says he doesn't think the Rams' loss to Green Bay 
was indicative of anything beyond a shaky start. "They've had a lot of people 
(holding) out of camp and a lot of injuries, but I think the Rams are one of 
the top three or four teams in the league," Perkins said. "They probably have 
the most weapons of any team in this league. Talk about the speed of their wide 
receivers, tight ends and running backs, and put (Jim) Everett in there 
surrounded by that big, good offensive line, (and) their offense is unlimited." 
. . . Injury update: Tackle Jackie Slater (dislocated toe) and linebacker Mike 
Wilcher (knee) are listed as questionable for Sunday. Cornerback Alfred Jackson 
(hand), tackle Robert Cox (ribs), guard Joe Milinichik (thumb) and fullback 
Buford McGee (hip) are probable.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOKCHAPMAN'S CAMPUS RECRUITING KEEPS WATER POLO TEAM 
AFLOAT

In his six weeks at Chapman College, water polo Coach Bill Brown hasn't had 
time to scout opponents. He's been busy with major reconnaissance work on his 
own campus. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the former water polo and swimming coach at Fullerton College, has used 
creative recruiting tactics to fill out a team on a campus that doesn't have a 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
The five team members remaining from last season's 11-13 team are solid 
players, Brown said, but seven are needed to play a match. So Brown and his 
players set up water polo information booths at a couple of campus activity 
fairs and Brown also enlisted a friend in the admissions office to help with 
recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"He screened applications and if they said anything about water he'd direct 
them to me," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one player -- Dan Gilmartin, a freshman who played water polo at San 
Mateo High School -- signed up in this fashion. Brown said Gilmartin is one of 
the team's top players, along with returning players Scott Law, Asher Provda, 
Mark Cantin, Mike Reid and goalkeeper Eric Wetzell. 
</P>
<P>
Other newcomers are the fraternity brothers of some of the team members, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's water polo or the pledge paddle," he said, joking. 
</P>
<P>
Eight players were eventually added to the team, one short of the number needed 
to hold an intrasquad scrimmage. But it was enough to run a program. 
</P>
<P>
"Several didn't know the school had a water polo team and five had never played 
before," Brown said. "But that's great. If they played youth soccer and know 
how to swim they can pick up (water polo)." 
</P>
<P>
That might be so, but Whittier defeated Chapman, 12-6, Wednesday. It seems the 
Panthers have a bit more to learn. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman had little trouble winning the Naval Academy women's volleyball 
tournament last weekend, breezing through six matches without losing a game. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers defeated Nebraska Omaha,which was ranked ninth in the American 
Volleyball Coaches Assn. preseason poll, in the quarterfinals and Juniata of 
Huntingdon, Pa. -- runner-up in the Division III championships last season -- 
in the final. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we did really well in the tournament in what was really our first week 
of playing," Chapman Coach Mary Cahill said. "With volleyball it's hard to win 
three straight (games in a match) no matter what team you play against. When we 
played against weaker teams we didn't play their game, we played ours." 
</P>
<P>
The trip to the tournament in Annapolis, Md., was partly intended as a way for 
the Panthers (10-4) to get some eastern exposure, Cahill said. Chapman has had 
difficulty gaining recognition in the East, Cahill said, despite playing in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn., a conference that has won five of the 
nine Division II championships. 
</P>
<P>
After losing to UC Riverside in the regional playoffs last season and finishing 
27-6 and eighth-ranked nationally, Chapman seems to be getting more respect. 
The Panthers were ranked 15th in the preseason coaches' poll and moved up to 
11th in this week's rankings. They will play host to eighth-ranked West Texas 
State at 7:30 tonight at Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
New blood: The Chapman women's basketball team, which has no starters returning 
from last year's team, has added three experienced players. 
</P>
<P>
They are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jennifer Ballenger, a senior point guard who started three games for Idaho 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Marvette Williams, a senior post player who played two seasons for Compton 
College, averaging 21 points and 14 rebounds during the 1987-88 season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Linda Kirby, a junior guard from Ohlone College in Fremont, averaged 22 
points and six assists a game last season. 
</P>

HE'S THE STOPPER ON BALL STATE'S DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: FORMER CORONA DEL MAR STANDOUT SEAN TURNER IS AN EXPERT AT DEFENDING 
AGAINST THE RUN. AND HE'S EQUALLY PROFICIENT AGAINST THE PASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sean Turner doesn't mind playing against the pass as a defensive back at Ball 
State in Muncie, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
And it doesn't bother him to chase receivers all over the fields of the 
Mid-American Conference. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that he'd rather defend against the run. Even the name of his 
position -- strong safety -- seems to imply that Turner should be more 
concerned with the physical aspects of the position. When Turner talks about 
pass defense, his answers seem routine. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind it," he said. "It's part of the position." 
</P>
<P>
But his voice suddenly becomes quick-charged when the topic turns to the run. 
</P>
<P>
"The safeties here are involved in run support a lot," said Turner, 6 feet 2, 
190 pounds. "I like it a lot. You're right up there where the action is all the 
time. That's what I like." 
</P>
<P>
Ball State opened its season on Saturday with a 13-3 victory over Illinois 
State and is leading the nation in total defense. The Cardinals play at 
Wisconsin Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said his desire to stop the run started in the Orange County High School 
all-star game in the summer of 1986 after he had graduated from Corona del Mar 
High School. He played fullback and defensive back in high school, but in the 
all-star game he concentrated on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, he was set on a position, but as for a college, that would change a 
few times. He started at Division II UC Davis. He said he chose UC Davis 
because it was one of the best of the schools to recruit him. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1986, he started at Davis, and was an all-Northern Athletic 
Conference selection. His success proved to him that he could play on the 
Division I level, so he left. 
</P>
<P>
First, Turner tried to walk on at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to leave (UC Davis)," he said. "I liked it there. But I just felt 
I had to give it (Division I) a chance. And you've got to set your goals high." 
</P>
<P>
After a redshirt year at USC in 1987, where the coaches hardly learned his 
name, Turner decided to try something a little closer to home. So he attended 
Orange Coast College in 1988. He was an instant hit with the Pirates, and with 
opposing ball carriers. He was OCC's leading tackler, setting a single-season 
school record with 101. 
</P>
<P>
"He always knows what he's doing on the field," OCC Coach Bill Workman said. 
"Basically, he's a coach's dream. He's a big-time hitter with tremendous 
leadership ability." 
</P>
<P>
After his standout season at OCC, Turner was close to getting his wish. He was 
being recruited by several Division I colleges, including Ball State. Turner 
decided to go there, because he would have a chance to start right away and the 
defensive plan called for the safeties to be heavily involved in stopping the 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a really good run defender," Ball State secondary coach Tim Burke said. 
"But he's equally good against the pass. He can play free safety, as well, if 
there is a need." 
</P>
<P>
Turner was a starter last fall and helped the Cardinals to a 7-2-2 
regular-season record. Ball State won the conference title and a berth in the 
California Raisin Bowl against Big West champion Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
That gave Turner a chance to play in his home state, but he would have to 
endure some pain to do so. 
</P>
<P>
In its final regular-season game, Ball State needed a victory over Ohio 
University to clinch the bowl berth. Early in the second quarter Turner got his 
left arm caught between two helmets, smashing a bone in his forearm. He played 
the rest of the game -- a33-14 Ball State victory -- but a post-game 
examination revealed he had a broken bone. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a little swelling during the game," Turner said. "But later it was 
pretty bad. They wanted to operate. But I told them 'No way.' I was going home 
to play in a bowl game no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
Turner's arm instead was put in a cast from his hand to his elbow. Just before 
the California Bowl, the cast was trimmed so it protected only the break. His 
arm was wrapped up so much it looked like Turner had a club, but he was able to 
play in the 27-6 loss. 
</P>
<P>
The day he returned to Ball State he had surgery, in which a plate and two 
screws were inserted. The plate is large enough that it once set off a metal 
detector at an airport terminal, but it won't be a life-long accessory. It can 
be removed once Turner's playing career is over. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that big a deal," Turner said. "The bone healed correctly and the 
scar is pretty small." 
</P>
<P>
Turner spent last summer working at the beach and lifting weights to prepare 
for this season. He also received an unexpected honor before the season when he 
was elected defensive team captain. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who have been around here longer than me," Turner said. 
"But I guess through playing hard I was picked. They must respect the way I 
play."

CAL WITHDRAWS FROM UCI WATER POLO EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's water polo team, in mourning after the deaths of three students in 
a fire at the fraternity house where some team members live, has withdrawn from 
the UC Irvine tournament this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Coach Steve Heaston notified Irvine on Wednesday that his team would not 
participate, said Bob Olson, Irvine sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
Team members have spent much of this week attending memorial services for the 
students, and a memorial is scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A fire of unknown origin swept through the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity house 
early Saturday. Members of the water polo team were competing in a tournament 
in Fresno at the time of the fire. A number of Cal football players are also 
members of the fraternity, but were playing a game in Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Cal, which lost to national champion Irvine in the NCAA water polo championship 
game last year, is ranked No. 1 in the nation. Friday's first round of pool 
play in the Irvine tournament was to have featured a rematch of the two teams. 
</P>
<P>
Cal is the only school ranked among the nation's top eight that will not 
participate in the Irvine tournament, which will be held at the Marian Bergeson 
Pool at Corona del Mar High School. Other ranked teams competing are the host 
Anteaters, UCLA, Stanford, Cal State Long Beach, USC, Pepperdine and UC Santa 
Barbara.

CHARTER SAVINGS BANK IS PUT UP FOR SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charter Savings Bank in Newport Beach and three other failed California savings 
and loans were among 65 government-run thrifts nationwide that federal 
regulators put up for sale Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators hope to sell or close the institutions by the end of the year, said 
Kate Spears, a spokeswoman for the Resolution Trust Corp., which manages and 
liquidates failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The 65 small- to medium-size thrifts hold a total of $9.7 billion in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators also expect to offer for sale a number of major thrifts -- those 
with assets that exceed $1 billion -- during the government's fiscal quarter 
ending Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Charter, regulators are peddling Brookside Savings and Southwest 
Savings, both in Los Angeles, and Time Savings in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Charter, which has $281.9 million in deposits, was declared insolvent and 
seized by regulators June 15, after securities losses and losses resulting from 
its 1988 acquisition of a troubled S&amp;L wiped out its capital. The FBI also 
is investigating bank fraud and embezzlement charges stemming from Charter's 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
With the pending sale of Charter, only one failed county thrift, Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, remains in such bad financial shape that the 
government is not offering it for sale. The only other failed county thrift 
still operating is Mercury Savings &amp; Loan in Huntington Beach, which 
regulators hope to sell by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Since the agency was created 13 months ago, it has seized five county thrifts 
and assumed management of five other failed thrifts. Nine other of the S&amp;Ls 
that have collapsed since 1985 were either sold or closed by RTC's predecessor 
agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.

As part of its ongoing expansion, Toshiba America Information Systems said 
Wednesday that it will hire 200 more people and boost production of laptop 
computers at its plant here starting Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion will double the number of manufacturing jobs at the company's 
Irvine plant to 400. 
</P>
<P>
Production of laptops will increase from 15,000 units a month to 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the company said, it will also increase production of printed 
circuit boards, which are used in computers and other electronics products, in 
Irvine from 5,000 a month to 10,000 by April, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion will require a $6.5-million investment in the manufacturing plant 
in the Irvine Spectrum business park, where the company opened the $9-million 
printed circuit board manufacturing plant in May. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion is part of Toshiba America's long-range goal to manufacture in 
the United States all of the products the company sells in the United States, 
said Kiichi Hataya, president of the unit, which is a subsidiary of electronics 
giant Toshiba Corp. of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba America said earlier this year that, based on high demand for laptop 
computers, it expects to employ about 3,000 people nationwide by March, 1992.

SALES OF CHILDREN'S VOLUMES SOAR AS STORES TRY TO KEEP PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When 11-year-old Roger Sachar's two younger sisters went to a horseback-riding 
camp in July, the San Juan Capistrano sixth-grader stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
As he told his mother, he couldn't possibly go horseback riding: "You can't 
read on a horse." 
</P>
<P>
Roger is a reader. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, to say that Roger Sachar enjoys reading is like saying that Tommy 
Lasorda loves linguine. 
</P>
<P>
"He's voracious," says Mary K. Sachar, his mother. "Whenever he can, he reads." 
</P>
<P>
Roger reads when they're driving in the car. 
</P>
<P>
He reads after school -- and before bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
He reads while standing in line with his mother at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
He even reads when he's in the bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
And when he went to a children's dude ranch in August he packed 10 new books 
into his suitcase. After all, he'd be gone for a week. 
</P>
<P>
So it comes as no surprise that Roger Sachar's favorite haunt is The Reading 
Rhinoceros, a children's bookstore in Mission Viejo where he loads up on Hardy 
Boys books, classic horror stories, sports books, history books and 
biographies. 
</P>
<P>
"Reading is really good," he said during a recent literary excursion to The 
Reading Rhinoceros. "Just by sitting in a chair and opening a book I can go any 
place, anywhere, any time. I can feel people's feelings, and I can find out 
about things that I didn't know before." 
</P>
<P>
Roger is one of the bookstore's regulars, his mother buying up to 10 books when 
they stop by about every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a number of kids like that who just devour books, but Roger definitely 
reads more than a lot of kids do," said bookstore owner Janelle Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Families like the Sachars are one reason more bookstores like The Reading 
Rhinoceros are cropping up not only in Orange County but across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The year-old shop is part of the still-burgeoning phenomenon of bookstores 
catering to young readers, a trend that began gaining momentum in the mid-'80s 
and, like Roger's reading habit, shows no sign of abating as children's book 
sales continue to soar to record highs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been booming the past five years," said Don Robinson, owner of Half 
Magic: A Children's Bookstore in Tustin. "The industry has really started to 
take off and publishers have realized that children's books are now a viable 
entity within their line." 
</P>
<P>
Not only has the number of children's books published in the United States 
nearly doubled since the early '80s to about 4,500 new titles a year, but the 
sale of children's books represents the fastest-growing segment of the 
publishing industry, according to industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
"It is, in fact, the major success story of publishing because adult book sales 
are relatively flat now, whereas children's books have been booming and are 
expected to continue well into the '90s," said Phyllis Fogelman, president, 
publisher and editor-in-chief of Dial Books for Young Readers, which has been 
publishing children's books for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Americans spent a record $1.07 billion on children's hardback books 
and another $442.8 million on paperbacks, according to the Book Industry Study 
Group, a nonprofit research organization. By comparison, only $312.7 million 
was spent on juvenile hardbacks and $143.3 million for paperbacks in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of reasons are given for the children's bookstore boom, including 
independent booksellers having to specialize to compete against the big chain 
bookstores, and the trend away from dull basic primers and toward more exciting 
literature-based reading instruction. In California, under state schools Supt. 
Bill Honig's 1985 California Reading Initiative, the state Department of 
Education prepared a list of more than 1,000 recommended books designed to 
enrich the teaching of reading and children's literature. 
</P>
<P>
But the overriding reason for the children's book phenomenon -- general 
bookstores also have added or expanded their children's departments -- is the 
simple fact that the baby-boom generation has created a baby boomlet of its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
And many of these parents, well-educated and relatively affluent, not only have 
an interest in turning their children into readers, but they have the 
disposable income to keep their children's bookshelves well-stocked. 
</P>
<P>
"The young parents want to help educate their children," said Sara Brant, 
former owner of the Children's Bookshoppe in Newport Beach, where she still 
serves as a consultant. "They know they have a responsibility as well as the 
school, and they try to reinforce what is going on in the school." 
</P>
<P>
The Children's Bookshoppe, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, is 
believed to be the first children's bookstore in Orange County and the sixth in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The formation of the Assn. of Booksellers for Children in 1985 is a sign of the 
times. The national organization estimates that there are now between 400 and 
500 children's specialty bookstores in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Waldenbooks, the nation's largest bookstore chain, launched its Waldenkids 
division in 1987 and now boasts 23 Waldenkids bookstores specializing in 
children's books. 
</P>
<P>
As Fogelman of Dial Books sees it, the increase in children's bookstores "has 
been wonderful for children's books at all levels. 
</P>

"The fact is that the speciality children's bookstores are committed to very 
good books, and they do a great deal of what is called hand selling: They've 
read the books and recommend them specifically to particular customers for 
particular children. That's a matter of knowing the stock, knowing every book 
in the store. And they really do." 
</P>
<P>
Says Darlene Daniel, president of the Southern California Children's 
Booksellers Assn., one of five regional groups formed in the past five years: 
"I'd call it a flowering of children's bookselling. 
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely a greater number of books being published each year, and 
there is more variety in the books. We're seeing greater attention to 
multiethnic books, nonfiction as well as fiction, for infants through teens. 
And publishers are putting more resources behind quality printing and 
full-color illustrations." 
</P>
<P>
The Reading Rhinoceros in Mission Viejo, which boasts 8,000 different titles, 
is typical of the children's bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
Mary K. Sachar said store owner Janelle Kennedy, a former elementary school 
teacher, "makes it an exciting place for kids." 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are so deadened because of the TV programs they watch, you've got to 
really have something there to sell them," Sachar said. "A store like The 
Reading Rhinoceros can compete and make it exciting and make it easy for you as 
a parent to introduce books. This is all geared to them and she (Kennedy) is 
excited about literature. She'll suggest new books to keep your child's 
interest piqued." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously," Kennedy said, "it's our goal to turn kids onto books so they're 
not spending as much time in front of the TV." 
</P>
<P>
To help attract young readers to their stores, children's bookstore owners 
offer some creative promotions and events. 
</P>
<P>
Half Magic in Tustin holds periodic Pajama Nights, an evening story hour in 
which 4- to 8-year-old customers show up in pajamas to listen to Robinson's 
wife, Bonnie, a reading specialist with the Orange Unified School District, 
read stories. 
</P>
<P>
The store also has held both a Shark Day and a Dinosaur Day with a visiting 
paleontologist, not to mention Animal Day, with a visiting assortment of 
snakes, monkeys, porcupines and lizards. 
</P>
<P>
The response to all the special events has been so overwhelming, Robinson said, 
that they now must have sign-up sheets. 
</P>
<P>
The Kid's Place Annex in Irvine recently held a free outdoor concert with 
singer Linda Arnold, a children's entertainer. The Children's Book Cottage in 
Laguna Niguel has had puppet shows, Ted E. Bear and Friends Children's 
Bookstore in Huntington Beach hosts a Bubble Day each summer and The Reading 
Rhinoceros has held creative writing classes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to book signings with children's authors and illustrators, 
virtually every children's bookstore offers story hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Children's Bookshoppe conducts story time for 3- and 4-year-olds before the 
store opens during the week and on Saturday mornings for older children. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Dierkes of Fountain Valley has been bringing her 4-year-old daughter, 
Madelaine, to the Monday morning reading for a year. Now her 9-month-old 
daughter, Lily, comes too. 
</P>
<P>
"We come so they get the thrill of reading, exposed to all the books," Kierkes 
said as she held Lily in her lap while Madelaine sat on the floor listening to 
employee Susan Finch read "The Best Dressed Bear." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good atmosphere too, because everyone enjoys books," Kierkes says. 
"I'm sure she (Madelaine) picks up on that." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some parents, Kierkes is not interested in teaching Madelaine to read 
before she's in school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather have her fall into it," she said. "I just want her to love reading. 
I think if she loves it she'll do fine." 
</P>
<P>
As a former elementary school teacher who works part time at the store, Susan 
Finch said that "the children who are read to from the time they are little 
turn out to be excellent readers." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson of Half Magic agrees. He said he is often asked by parents how to help 
ensure that their young children will become readers when they're older. 
</P>
<P>
"We say, 'Read to them,' " he said. "We can't express enough the importance of 
reading to kids. That is the best way to get your kids to like reading and get 
used to reading and it really gives them the edge." 
</P>
<P>
Children's booksellers, many of whom are former teachers and librarians, feel a 
strong commitment to promote reading. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel said many children's booksellers take book programs into the schools and 
speak to organizations that are interested in "the well-being of children. 
They're spokespeople for children's book publishing." 
</P>
<P>
Since children's books are rarely reviewed in newspapers, the 35-store-member 
Southern California Children's Booksellers Assn. selects several dozen 
recommended new children's books to critique. A collection of brief reviews 
runs twice a year as a paid insert in the Los Angeles Times' Book Review 
section. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, who owns PAGES, Books for Children and Young Adults in Tarzana, said, 
"One of the major reasons I opened the store was I wanted to gather together a 
selection of very motivating children's books and help youngsters find the 
adventure and excitement and pleasure of reading, along with the learning that 
can be found in reading. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just nothing more special than a youngster coming in and saying, 'That 
book you suggested is just wonderful.' " 
</P>
<P>
Children like Roger Sachar, of course, need no encouragement to read. 
</P>
<P>
The Sachars began reading to Roger when he was 3 months old. 
</P>
<P>
But even Mary K. Sachar is amazed by her son's prodigious reading habit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 'balance' is a key word here he needs to focus on," Sachar said. "We 
actually said, 'You have to spend time not reading.' " 
</P>
<P>
Roger, who talks of one day becoming a writer, a sports announcer -- or 
President -- doesn't think he reads too much. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's possible to read too much," he said. "Just like it's not 
possible to know too much." 
</P>
<P>
Sachar, whose two daughters are not avid readers, said Roger is constantly 
"bugging" her to take him to The Reading Rhinoceros. 
</P>
<P>
She said she felt guilty about spending $100 during a recent visit to the 
bookstore -- until a neighbor complained about the "fortune" she had just spent 
on her son's soccer shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Laughed Sachar: "I just prefer to spend money on my son's mind rather than 
shoes." 
</P>

HOW TO JOIN A SOFTBALL LEAGUE IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELENA BRUNET 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last call to sign up for the fall season of softball leagues in some cities in 
Orange County: Fields are already reserved, and teams are playing in the 
majority of cities. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, the team must be registered with the city. Only men's and co-ed 
leagues are offered. (Co-ed teams require five men and five women players.) The 
level of play must be specified (A, B, C or D with A the most proficient) as 
must the type of game: men's or co-ed fast or slow pitch. The application must 
specify preferences for playing field, day and time (first through sixth 
choices). The name of the team and the names and addresses of the players must 
be provided. The fast-pitch league requires nine players on a team; the 
slow-pitch league requires 10. In the last few years in Santa Ana, the number 
of softball teams per season has averaged more than 600 (there are four 
seasons), according to Randy Hoopii, recreation program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of La Habra, teams must fill out a registration form and pay a fee 
to join the men's or co-ed leagues. In the two remaining days of registration, 
the community services department will take applications as long as slots are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
In San Juan Capistrano, sign-ups are taking place right now and will continue 
through tomorrow. Only men's softball is offered for the fall season; co-ed 
teams begin in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The softball league in Laguna Beach accepts only locals. Players must live 
within the Laguna Beach Unified School District boundaries or have proof of 
employment within the city limits. There are men's and women's leagues but no 
co-ed league. Prices and leagues are designated by the circumference of the 
softball used, 12- or 16-inch. 
</P>
<P>
A point system is utilized in cities such as Orange and Santa Ana to determine 
registration priority. Points are awarded to teams with members who are 
residents. In Santa Ana one point is also awarded to a team that played during 
the previous season or to a team from a workplace located in the city. If too 
many teams sign up and some must be eliminated, teams with the most points get 
top priority. The system also encourages teams to seek out their neighbors to 
fill their rosters. Non-residents are not excluded, but they get no points. 
</P>
<P>
In Seal Beach, points are awarded only to teams that have played previously in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
In Mission Viejo, leagues (organized by the Saddleback Valley Recreation 
Services) are nearly full, but an independent softball league still has space 
in its men's C and D leagues, which play on Sunday nights. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline has passed for leagues in Anaheim, Buena Park, Costa Mesa, 
Cypress, Fountain Valley, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Irvine, La 
Palma, Los Alamitos, Newport Beach, Placentia, Tustin, Westminster, Yorba 
Linda, and leagues are already in play. Dana Point is connected with Capistrano 
Bay Parks and Recreation. The city of Brea will not have a league until the 
spring. None exists in Villa Park.

COLLECTOR BUYS 'WINGED FIGURE,' WILL DONATE IT TO MUSEUM; 
</P>
<P>
CONTROVERSY: THE ICARUS-THEMED PAINTING OF A NUDE MALE TORSO THAT HAD BEEN 
COMMISSIONED -- THEN REJECTED -- FOR JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT, IS PURCHASED BY A 
LAGUNA ART MUSEUM TRUSTEE.

<P>
Jim Morphesis' controversial painting "Winged Figure" will be donated to the 
Laguna Art Museum by a longtime museum trustee who agreed Tuesday to buy the 
work from the New York artist for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
"Winged Figure" is the Icarus-themed painting of a nude male torso commissioned 
for a poster that was to commemorate the opening of the new terminal at John 
Wayne Airport. The poster was squelched after an airport commissioner objected 
to the painting as "inappropriate" to the occasion because of the nudity and 
because it featured no airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Art Museum trustee Joan B. Rehnborg, whose private collection of 
contemporary art includes three other Morphesis paintings, said she decided to 
buy "Winged Figure" and give it to the museum as a way of "taking someone 
else's missed opportunity and turning it into a nice opportunity for us." 
</P>
<P>
Rehnborg also said her offer was meant as a vote of confidence in the artist. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect and admire Jim's work a great deal," she said. "I like him very much 
as a person. I saw the work here at the museum. It's a very strong work; it's 
stunning. The museum's collection will be enhanced by it." 
</P>
<P>
Although she would not specify how much she will pay Morphesis, Rehnborg said 
the amount exceeds the $5,000 the artist had agreed to take as part of the deal 
on the posters but said that it is less than he would ask if he was to sell 
"Winged Figure" on the open market. "Our arrangement was a compromise, but it 
was a price he was satisfied with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Museum spokeswoman Nancy Coop said the painting will be added to the museum's 
permanent collection pending acceptance by the collections committee and by the 
board of trustees, which are expected to approve the donation. "Winged Figure" 
is scheduled to be exhibited at the museum Sept. 28 through Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnborg describes herself as a "born-again" Christian and said that "the irony 
of (that) struck me last night. . . . I get kidded about that a lot in the art 
world. But I also have written my own letter to the President as well as a 
dozen or so senators and congressmen asking for unrestricted reauthorization" 
of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
She said her collection focuses on artworks that include Christian symbology 
and that the three Morphesis works she bought previously are from his 
Crucifixion series. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim's gift, as far as I'm concerned, is a gift from God. He's a beautiful 
painter. It's great that he can share his gift this way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The nudity" in "Winged Figure" "is very tasteful," she added. "It's a very 
strong work of art overall." 
</P>
<P>
She said she does not object to federal funding of more explicit works such as 
the controversial photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe "because, No. 1, 
I think there are far more obscene examples of pornography in the local video 
store. And I would rather risk a little bad taste in art exhibits than have 
someone else determining what is good taste for me."

STATE OKS HAMMER'S PLAN TO BUY BACK USC ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California attorney general's office has approved a controversial proposal 
by industrialist Armand Hammer to buy back a painting collection he donated to 
USC 25 years ago. Hammer wants to add the USC collection to the Westwood museum 
that he intends to open in late November. 
</P>
<P>
The state approval -- sought by USC to ensure that the transaction would not 
violate California charitable trust laws -- was confirmed earlier this week by 
the attorney general's office, USC sources and Hammer's New York attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether the sale by USC to Hammer of the 49 
paintings in question could be consummated in time for any of the work to be 
shown Nov. 28, when the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center is 
scheduled to open. 
</P>
<P>
However, USC sources and Hammer's lawyer confirmed that the decision by the 
attorney general's office to approve the sale had brought to a close a testy 
confrontation between Hammer and the university over Hammer's refusal to return 
to USC's Fisher Gallery two paintings by the 17th-Century Flemish master Peter 
Paul Rubens. 
</P>
<P>
The Rubens paintings "Venus Wounded by a Thorn" and "The Nativity," which some 
Rubens experts suggested might have a combined value of $15 million to $30 
million, have been on display at Occidental Petroleum Corp. headquarters for 
several years, after Hammer borrowed them back from USC. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear if Hammer would relocate the two Rubens paintings to the 
museum before the buyback is made final. 
</P>
<P>
USC sources and Robert Fass, the New York lawyer representing Hammer and 
Occidental -- of which Hammer is chairman and which has paid the entire costs 
of building the controversial museum -- said there was also an agreement 
between the two parties on how to arrive at a fair market price for the 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer and USC will both appoint independent appraisers, each of whom will 
value the entire collection, Fass and USC sources said. Fass said there will be 
separate provisions for additional appraisal steps if the two experts -- who 
have not yet been named, he said -- disagree substantially. 
</P>
<P>
Fass said the appraisals and the final closing of the transaction will occur 
"as rapidly as the convenience of both parties permits," but he emphasized that 
Hammer and USC have "absolutely no idea" of the amount of money that will 
change hands. 
</P>
<P>
Fass and James Cordi, a deputy state attorney general, said state charitable 
trust officials had agreed to approve the buyback after Hammer supplied a 
letter declaring his intent to incorporate the paintings into the museum's 
permanent collection. 
</P>
<P>
When Hammer first proposed that he repurchase the collection late last year, 
questions arose over whether tax laws might be violated by his buying back 
artworks for which he received a substantial tax deduction when he donated them 
and whether state charity laws might make it difficult for the paintings to 
pass out of the hands of a nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
Museum experts questioned by The Times earlier this year said they were unaware 
of any buyback transaction between a museum and a wealthy donor. 
</P>
<P>
The Hammer declaration spelling out how he will employ the artworks, Cordi 
said, convinced state officials that the original justification for the tax 
deduction in 1965 -- that the pictures in question would be accessible to the 
public in a museum -- would continue to be satisfied if the paintings were 
simply transferred from one art center to another. 
</P>
<P>
Requirements that the donated works remain in the safekeeping of a public trust 
would be met, Cordi said, because the paintings will go to Hammer's museum, 
which has attained nonprofit status with state officials and the Internal 
Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
The museum recently won a shareholders lawsuit that challenged Occidental's 
decision to spend $96 million to $130 million building and endowing the museum. 
The case, which is being heard in Delaware, where Occidental is incorporated, 
is under appeal by the losing shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer faces separate litigation by the niece of his late wife, Frances, who 
contends that, as Frances Hammer's sole heir, she has a 50% community property 
interest in Hammer's large personal art collection. The collection, valued at 
as much as $450 million, forms the basis of what will be shown at the Hammer 
museum. That collection is separate from the USC paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer and the university became embroiled in a dispute earlier this year after 
Hammer resisted a series of university requests for return of the two loaned 
Rubenses and after he proposed the buyback.

INDIVIDUAL OWNERS MAY GET VOICE IN REDEVELOPMENT PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday unanimously adopted a 
developmental concept that, for the first time since downtown revitalization 
began 18 years ago, encourages individual property owners to work together to 
improve their area. 
</P>
<P>
The concept would permit individual owners to renovate or replace their 
buildings in a two-block area south of Broadway. In the past, owners of smaller 
properties generally have been forced to sell their holdings in the downtown 
area to make way for large-scale, high-rise projects by single developers, 
Jeanne Armstrong, redevelopment director, said. 
</P>
<P>
But now, with a great demand for office space, low-rise buildings in the area 
are economically feasible, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The concept was bolstered in part by the agency's growing concern over 
increasing traffic congestion from large-scale developments. 
</P>
<P>
And, Armstrong said, downtown redevelopment "is moving so well that, with 
encouragement, the economic forces will take the lead, as they should," 
allowing property owners to make their own improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to force the market into anything it is not ready for," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
She said a key to the plan is the city's willingness to build a parking garage 
to serve new development and renovation in the area bounded by Brand Boulevard 
on the west, Louise Street on the east, Broadway on the north and Harvard 
Street on the south. Much of the area consists of parking lots or buildings 
that are badly deteriorated, ugly, vacant or beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
A city-sponsored garage would make reconstruction or development of new retail 
space financially feasible, Armstrong said. The development design adopted 
Tuesday by the agency, which consists of the five Glendale City Council 
members, calls for two parking garages. One, to be built by the agency on the 
northeast corner of Harvard Street and Maryland Avenue, would have 820 spaces. 
The other would have space for 370 vehicles and be built privately for office 
development on Brand Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong told agency members that "the amount of parking which the agency and 
private sector together provide will set the limits on the total development" 
in the two-block area. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, individual owners along Brand generally had only small lots and did 
not have the economic resources or interests to take on a block-long project, 
Armstrong said. Today, however, property owners have larger parcels and appear 
willing to participate in redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have is a blueprint for development and we will work with individual 
property owners to encourage them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would extend the "Exchange," a two-block area north of Broadway. 
The renovation project features a pedestrian-oriented treatment of Maryland 
Avenue, decorated with stately palm trees and bubbling fountains. 
</P>
<P>
Two "master developers" were named in that area to oversee reconstruction and 
development. Many of the owners of small lots there simply sold their property 
or were forced by the city to sell to the master developer of their block. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said the city has no plans yet to select a master developer for the 
area south of Broadway. Instead, the agency is asking individual owners to come 
up with their own plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have enough interest there to do without a master developer," 
Armstrong said. She said the interest became evident in March when a large 
group of owners and developers crammed into an agency study session to learn 
more about proposed expansion of the Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago the property owners wanted to develop their own renovation 
plans, but the city turned them down, opting instead to pursue a more grandiose 
plan consisting of retail and office space plus condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for that development, called the Colonnades, fell through in 1984 because 
the developer, Goldrich, Kest &amp; Associates of Sherman Oaks, decided that it 
wanted to build apartments and a residential hotel instead of condominiums -- a 
plan the city did not like -- and because the developer failed to meet 
financial commitments. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimated that the Exchange, just east of the Glendale Galleria, 
may not be ripe for high-density development for at least 15 years, if ever. In 
the meantime, construction and renovation are feasible, they say.

VANDALS PAINT HATE CRIME SYMBOLS IN CHURCH OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what has been classified as Glendale's fourth hate crime of the year, 
intruders painted a pentagram and a swastika on the walls of a Montrose church 
office during a weekend burglary and vandalism spree. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Police Agent Chris Loop said the intruders apparently used a passkey 
between midnight and 7:30 a.m. Saturday to enter the youth pastor's office at 
Christian Life Church, 3013 Montrose Ave. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests had been made by midweek. 
</P>
<P>
The intruders vandalized the office with blue, red and white paint that the 
church had purchased two days earlier to spruce up a preschool classroom. The 
circled pentagram, commonly used in Satanic worship, and the swastika were each 
about three feet wide and painted in red, Loop said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are hate-crime symbols, no doubt about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission reported last week that hate 
crimes targeting racial groups, houses of worship and sexual orientations were 
up significantly countywide during the first six months of 1990, contrasted 
with the same period last year. But Loop said Glendale, which recorded eight 
hate crimes last year, has experienced fewer incidents this year. 
</P>
<P>
At the Montrose church, the intruders took microphones, a camera, computer 
programs and a printer worth a reported total of $1,850. They also caused 
$6,700 in damage to clothing, electronic equipment and office furnishings.

POTENT WESTLAKE FACES BIG TEST AGAINST OXNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westlake High will try to negate Oxnard's running attack with its potent 
passing game when the teams meet at 7:30 tonight in a nonleague football game 
at at Thousand Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake (1-0), which gained 323 yards in a 41-20 win over Buena on Friday, is 
led by senior quarterback Todd Preston, who completed 10 of 21 passes for 192 
yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Preston, a three-year starter who has thrown for 3,334 yards in his high school 
career, is aided by a talented group of skill players that includes receivers 
Erik Holcomb (four receptions for 103 yards) and Seamus Gibbons (three for 56 
yards). Rueben Allen complemented the passing attack with 120 rushing yards in 
13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard (1-0) relies on a large offensive line that paves the way for tailback 
Kenyon Lewis, who rushed for 116 yards in 19 carries in a 21-15 win over 
Camarillo last week. Quarterback Larry Bumpus completed six of 15 for 198 yards 
and capped a 97-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown run with 51 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"They're big and Lewis is a very good runner," Westlake Coach Jim Benkert said. 
"It will be a very good test for us." 
</P>
<P>
In another nonleague game, La Canada will visit Glendale at 7:30 p.m. The teams 
opened the season last week with wins but in vastly different fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, behind Pathon Rucker's 191 rushing yards, beat Alhambra, 36-13. La 
Canada, however, needed a one-yard plunge by Chris Mozilo in the fourth quarter 
and an interception from Vahram Mossaedi in the final minute to seal a 10-7 win 
over Crescenta Valley.

TITO PUENTE MAINTAINING A STEADY BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, New York-born Latino band leader and percussionist Tito Puente 
announced that he planned to cut back on touring and performing and would, 
instead, begin to take it easy. 
</P>
<P>
After all, at 63, Puente's sensible side argued, how could he keep up the pace 
that he had set in the late 1940s, the era in which fans dubbed him "El Rey" 
(The King)? 
</P>
<P>
But his sensible side didn't prevail: Slowing down doesn't seem to be part of 
the ever-energetic Puente's repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
Now 67, the indefatigable three-time Grammy winner recently completed a 14-city 
European tour followed by a stop in Los Angeles in August, where he performed 
at two concerts and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
He is currently back in New York recording his 100th album, composing music for 
the upcoming film "The Mambo Kings" and serving as Coca-Cola's national 
spokesman for the Latino market. He will return to Los Angeles in November to 
headline with salsa queen Celia Cruz at the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Every few years I say the same thing: I plan to retire soon. But the music has 
become very popular worldwide and -- they're asking for me," Puente says in a 
tone of mock vanity. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Puente -- who began his musical career at 13 -- seems to be adding new 
and younger Southern California fans to his established audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Their parents were the ones that introduced them to Latin music," Puente said. 
</P>
<P>
And his younger fans will soon get a fresh dose of the kind of sounds their 
parents listened to a few decades ago. Puente's next album will feature some of 
the singers he played with in his early days, a kind of return to his salsa 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be the real typical music like I used to do in the old dance 
mania days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Puente, the son of Puerto Rican immigrants, grew up in Spanish Harlem hearing 
Caribbean rhythms at home and big band music on the radio. Seeing his early 
love for music, his parents enrolled him in piano lessons when he was 7. But it 
was his constant tapping and banging on anything that could be pounded that 
steered him in the direction he would eventually take. He began getting paying 
jobs as a drummer in his early teens and by 18 was playing with the Afro-Cubans 
of the legendary Machito, another popular Latin ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
After serving in World War II, during which he taught himself to play 
saxophone, he studied at the Juilliard School of Music. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, his love for Latin salsa rhythms and for the jazzy big band 
sound grew. He developed a style that fused the two musical traditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to maintain a marriage between Latin music and jazz," he said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA music professor Steve Loza, who lobbied to get Puente a star on the Walk 
of Fame, said the percussionist has become a symbol to the Latino community in 
Los Angeles as well as New York. 
</P>
<P>
"He is such an important man in this town," Loza said. "I feel that he is the 
Latin artist of the present that has accomplished the most in terms of 
preserving a very important musical tradition and progressing on it." 
</P>
<P>
And the music seems to appeal to a diverse audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicanos have always been very faithful and loyal and really tuned in to Tito 
Puente," Loza said. "Now you have a lot of Puerto Ricans and Cubans here (in 
Los Angeles) too, and he's also popular with a mainstream audience." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his leading role in the development of Latin-flavored jazz, Puente does 
not like to hear his music labeled "ethnic." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not ethnic music; it's good music," he says with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
He also rejects being characterized as a "crossover" success, the notion that 
his music has crossed over from a strictly Latino audience to a multiethnic 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I always tell people, 'I'm not crossing over. I'm on my way back,' " he says 
in his trademark raspy-voiced staccato. 
</P>
<P>
Puente is credited with introducing the timbales (a kind of kettledrums played 
with sticks) in dance settings. 
</P>
<P>
It is his role as a pioneer in Latin dance music that has made Puente a 
sought-after figure on the seminar and lecture circuit as well as in the 
concert hall. UCLA's Loza plans to bring Puente to the university for two weeks 
next year to discuss Latin percussion with music students. 
</P>
<P>
Puente is enthusiastic about talking to students and sponsors a scholarship at 
Juilliard for Latino music students. He also has donated instruments to various 
performing arts high schools in New York. 
</P>
<P>
It is this social conscience that has driven him to denounce a controversial 
rap group's use of one of his most famous songs, "Oye Como Va." The well-known 
chorus of the song is used in the background of a rap tune recorded by the 
group 2 Live Crew on its latest album, "Banned in the U.S.A." Puente considers 
the song, which discusses the sexual appetites of Cuban, Puerto Rican and 
Mexican-American women, demeaning to Latinos. Songs from a previous album by 
the rap group were recently ruled obscene by a Florida judge. 
</P>
<P>
Puente sees himself as a kind of role model to young Latinos and worries about 
any association with a group whose music has been labeled obscene. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a family man, and it disgusts me what they're doing," he said. "Now what 
I'm afraid will happen is when I play my 'Oye Como Va' people will think I'm 
copying them." 
</P>
<P>
Though the rock group Santana made a big hit out of "Oye Como Va," the veteran 
bandleader is not enamored of hard-driving rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
But that is the genre that most appeals to his 21-year-old son, Tito Jr. The 
younger Puente plays in a rock band called Monoxide, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
Puente mocks the amplified sounds of the electric guitar and complains that 
when his son's group practices, "it feels like an earthquake hit the house." 
</P>
<P>
"That music," he says with a sigh. "I never know where the downbeat is. . . . 
There's no salsa, no cymbals."

IS 'EVITA' IN MADONNA'S FUTURE?

* Disney Studios VIPs are so delighted with Madonna's performance in "Dick 
Tracy" that they are hotly pursuing a project for her that Madonna has been 
"breathlessly" coveting for years -- "Evita." If things work out right, it will 
be the "Material Girl" in the screen role of Argentina's controversial former 
first lady. A prior film project starring Meryl Streep was shelved last year 
and, before that, a version starring Liza Minnelli was also discarded. But 
perhaps the third time's the charm inasmuch as one thing Madonna and Eva Peron 
share is plenty of "blonde ambition." 
</P>
<P>
Actor Edward James Olmos and three music industry veterans have formed an 
independent record company, Primero Entertainment Group. According to the 
Hollywood Reporter, the fledging company, described as a "crossover Hispanic 
label," aims to launch young Latino talent. An official for the company 
confirmed the report, but could not offer further information. Some of you may 
recall that before finding fame in the stage play "Zoot Suit," Olmos was known 
as a skilled singer, performing at various Southland clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The Univision network is launching "Platavision," a 90-minute programming block 
geared toward the 5-million-plus Latino children ages 2 to 11 in the U.S. 
market. A sitcom, "Pepe Plata," which will debut on Sept. 17, anchors the new 
programming. The series will star 16-year-old Simon Maldonado as fictional pop 
star Pepe Plata, the world's richest youth. The show will feature Dyana Ortelli 
("La Bamba" and the game show "Uno Nunca Sabe"), Luis Accinelli and Olivia 
Royval. The character of Pepe Plata will also be marketed as a recording star, 
with an original song performed weekly by Maldonado, who will be handled by the 
managers of the musical group New Kids on the Block. 
</P>
<P>
The highly rated Spanish-language TV program "Sabado Gigante" has inspired the 
first bilingual board game for the U.S. Latino market. Introduced by Univision 
Network and Milton Bradley, the game features a miniature figurine of the 
show's Chilean host, "Don Francisco," and bilingual cards that quiz players on 
a variety of trivia questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Adam 12" has returned to the TV screen as a new syndicated series featuring 
Alma Martinez ("Born in East L.A." and "Zoot Suit"), Ethan Wayne (son of actor 
John Wayne and his Peruvian-born wife, Pilar), and Peter Parros ("Knight 
Rider"). Its imaginative new title -- "The New Adam 12." And Universal Studios 
has also revived another police oldie, "Dragnet," under the title -- yes, you 
guessed it -- "The New Dragnet."

GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES SHOULD AVOID NUMBERS GAME; 
</P>
<P>
COMMENTARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS M. CALDERON, Thomas Calderon is president of Calderon, Bacon and 
Associates, a governmental and community affairs consulting company. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the gubernatorial campaign enters the final two months, Republican candidate 
Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein are moving through the "Hispanic 
circuit," speaking to the various statewide organizations in an effort to show 
their support for issues they perceive to be important to the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
On one level, their attempt to appeal to the Latino community is very positive 
and reaffirms the fact that Latinos are a political force in this state. On the 
other hand, if the debate on how to best serve this community boils down to how 
many political appointments will be made available by each Administration, 
we'll all lose no matter which candidate is elected. 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates should resist the temptation to reduce Latino issues to a 
numbers game on appointees. You'll find, for instance, that there are as many 
Latinos who are appalled by the notion of a quota system as there are those who 
favor the idea of parity (having Latino appointments on a par with Latinos' 
population percentage). 
</P>
<P>
In my mind, we benefit more from leadership that addresses fundamental issues 
in public policy with concern for equity, as well as access to institutions and 
adequate services in health and education. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, it does not do the community one bit of good to have Latinos 
filling posts within the Education Department if double-digit dropout rates 
persist because of inadequate resources. And what good would be done by 
appointing a Latino director of the Department of Health Services if there are 
no funds available to implement AIDS awareness programs or to provide adequate 
health care for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
If Feinstein and Wilson are sincere in their desire to serve Latinos, they 
should keep the following perspective in mind: 
</P>
<P>
Given the opportunity, Latinos have the drive and talent to excel. Given the 
resources, our children can overcome gangs and drugs, two issues that threaten 
their ability to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
True success is providing access to all. By offering leadership in the areas of 
education, health care and economic development, you will show Latinos that 
your commitment goes far beyond selective appointments, quotas, far beyond even 
parity.

Jose Angel Pescador Osuna will conduct the most patriotic ceremony of the year 
as Mexican consul general in Los Angeles on Sept. 15 at 11 p.m., when he 
commemorates the cry of independence given in 1810 by Father Miguel Hidalgo y 
Costilla in the town of Dolores, Mexico, marking the beginning of the end of 
Spanish domination in that country. 
</P>
<P>
A bell will toll, and on the front steps of City Hall Pescador Osuna will 
pronounce the traditional words of the ceremony: "Long live Mexico, long live 
Hidalgo, long live Morelos, long live Allende, long live the independence, long 
live freedom!" 
</P>
<P>
Then he will take the tricolored Mexican flag and swing it to one side to begin 
the singing of the national anthem: "Mexicans, as you hear the call to war. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
"For the celebration of the patriotic holiday commemorating the 180th 
anniversary of our independence, this year we have prepared a very sober and 
simple ceremony, in which there will not be many speeches," said Pescador 
Osuna, a former mayor of Mazatlan in Sinaloa state. 
</P>
<P>
Pescador Osuna, 45, has been in charge of the General Consulate of Mexico in 
Los Angeles for the past seven months. During that time, Pescador Osuna said, 
he has stressed the educational and cultural aspects of his consular mission. 
</P>
<P>
"We have initiated a series of visits to schools to explain Mexico's importance 
and to celebrate patriotic holidays other than May 5 and Sept. 16, such as Feb. 
24, which is Flag Day, and March 21, which is the birthday of Benito Juarez (a 
president of Mexico in the mid-19th Century)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pescador Osuna is an economist an educator. In 1964, he obtained a teaching 
credential in elementary education; in 1970, he graduated in economics from the 
Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico, and later he received a master's 
degree in education and economics at Stanford University. That background is 
useful in his current position. 
</P>
<P>
"Another of my priorities here in Los Angeles has been to promote the economic 
development of Mexico," he said. He has worked with the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, the Latin Business Assn. and the Mexican Chamber of Commerce of Los 
Angeles, he added. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pescador Osuna, the responsibilities of Mexican consuls in the 
United States have become broader than they used to be, and his duties now 
include more activism. "The protection of our compatriots is fundamental. We 
are not waiting any more for the complaints to reach us." 
</P>
<P>
The consul said that, although he sometimes disagrees with U.S. authorities, he 
maintains good relations with law enforcement officials and the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service.

A light plane clipped a power line and crashed onto a San Fernando street while 
attempting to land at Whiteman Airport in Pacoima, seriously injuring the pilot 
and his passenger, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Tony Ast, 31, a resident of the San Fernando Valley, had reported 
engine trouble moments before the Cessna 152 crashed at 11:10 p.m. Wednesday, a 
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ast and his passenger, Petra Yearwood, 32, also a Valley resident, suffered 
broken bones and were listed in serious condition at Holy Cross Medical Center 
in Mission Hills, hospital spokeswoman Maggie Cessar said. 
</P>
<P>
Ast was in surgery this morning, Cessar said, and Yearwood, who suffered a 
concussion and a possible spinal fracture, was expected to undergo surgery this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The plane nose-dived onto Truman Street at the intersection with Wolfskill 
Street after clipping a power line, San Fernando Police Sgt. William Miron 
said. The plane sustained major damage to its front end but did not erupt in 
flames, officials said.

A giant U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy transport plane missed a Qantas airliner with 
382 people aboard by only 50 feet in a near collision over southern Thailand, 
the Australian airline said today.

<P>
"Qantas has launched a full investigation into a near miss between one of its 
(Boeing) 747-400s and a United States Air Force C-5 Galaxy over Thailand on 
Tuesday," said the statement issued by the Qantas office in Bangkok. 
</P>

Qantas said the C-5, the largest aircraft used by the U.S. Air Force, was 
heading in a northerly direction when it passed directly above the Qantas 
aircraft, which was heading east on a flight from London to Singapore.

The Tennessee Court of Appeals today granted joint custody of seven frozen 
embryos to a divorced couple, overturning a landmark ruling that had granted 
custody to the ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
The intermediate-level appeals court ruled in the divorce case of Junior Lewis 
Davis of Maryville and his former wife, Mary Sue Davis Stowe, now of 
Titusville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be repugnant and offensive to constitutional principals to order Mary 
Sue to implant these fertilized ova against her will," Judge Herschel P. Franks 
wrote for the three-member court. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be equally repugnant to order Junior to bear the psychological, if 
not the legal, consequences of paternity against his will." 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that both Stowe and Davis should "share an interest in the 
seven fertilized ova" and should have joint control and an equal voice over 
their disposition.

Some soldiers being sent to the Persian Gulf have their children at home to 
worry about. But Air Force reservist Lorain Kuryla, who is nicknamed "Grambo," 
also has her five grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
When the United States began sending troops to the Gulf after Iraq's invasion 
of Kuwait, Kuryla -- an Air Force reservist for 19 years -- didn't hesitate to 
answer a call for volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I've been trained for, and I'm glad for the opportunity to serve 
my country," said Kuryla, who turns 63 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I feel better about going because I have no small children at home to 
care for," she added. "I feel it will relieve pressure from young mothers and 
fathers about being sent." 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of weird to think of my mother with an M-16," said her son, Michael 
Kuryla, 37. "I can honestly say that my mother wears combat boots." 
</P>
<P>
Leaving behind her family in west suburban Hillside, Kuryla, a master sergeant 
from the 928th Tactical Airlift Group, left O'Hare International Airport on 
Wednesday, bound for the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Kuryla works in Air Force personnel and will be one of three noncoms sent to 
the region to handle records, her son said. 
</P>
<P>
The grandchildren were the ones to come up with the "Grambo" nickname.

William Zeckendorf, one of the key players of the New York real estate market 
in the 1980s, has been hit by the crisis affecting the industry, it was 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
"In New York City's tottering real estate market, apparently no one is immune," 
the Wall Street Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
"Zeckendorf is being forced to restructure loans on two of his biggest 
projects." 
</P>
<P>
The developer has been meeting for three months with his lenders, Bank of 
Montreal and Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, to 
restructure loans that are part of Zeckendorf's liabilities estimated at $5 
billion, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Tighter credit and declining New York real estate values negatively affected 
Zeckendorf's business, regarded among the most soundly established throughout 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Zeckendorf is now in Tokyo to negotiate with Japanese builder Tobishima Corp. 
the sale of a substantial chunk of his New York properties, the newspaper said, 
adding that the deal is far from completed.

Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings, long a promoter of the Canadian 
National Institute for the Blind, made sure that his recent autobiography was 
printed in Braille. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky sponsors an annual celebrity softball game in his hometown of 
Brantford, Ontario, to raise money for the institute, and it was at his 
suggestion that the Canadian version of his book was made available for blind 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
The bulky, three-volume Braille edition of "Gretzky: An Autobiography" was 
introduced Wednesday by Gretzky during a news conference at the blind 
institute's office in Ottawa. The book will sell for $24.95, the same price as 
the print copy.

SHAW, CELTICS CLOSE TO DEAL, PAPER REPORTS

Guard Brian Shaw, who signed a contract with the Boston Celtics in January and 
then told the team he wanted to play a second year in Italy, reportedly is 
close to completing a deal that would return him to the Celtics this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Globe today said it learned from sources that the deal could be 
completed by the end of this week or early next week. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the Globe said, Shaw wants the Celtics to drop lawsuits 
pending against him and Il Messaggero, his Italian team, refrain from any 
future litigation against his agent, Jerome Stanley, and not ask him to issue a 
statement of regret or apology for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
"The basketball part, I think, is comfortable to Brian," one source told the 
newspaper. "It's the non-basketball part that still needs some work. There 
still is a lot of debris out there." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw played for the Celtics in the 1988-89 season, then played in Italy last 
season after becoming a free agent. In January, he signed a contract with the 
Celtics that runs through 1994, gives him a $450,000 signing bonus and a salary 
of $1.1 million for this season. 
</P>
<P>
But this summer he informed the Celtics that he would not honor the contract. 
The Celtics immediately went to arbitration and won. When Shaw failed to notify 
Il Messaggero by June 20 that he would not be returning for a second season, as 
the arbitrator ordered, the Celtics went to U.S. District Judge A. David 
Mazzone, who found Shaw in contempt.

YANKEES' NEDERLANDER WINS APPROVAL;

Broadway producer Robert Nederlander, promising to bring front office stability 
and fiscal sanity to the New York Yankees after George Steinbrenner's 17 1/2 
years, was unanimously approved today by major league owners as the team's new 
general partner. 
</P>
<P>
The owners ended their quarterly meetings by extending American League 
President Dr. Bobby Brown's contract for two years and by more than doubling 
the pension benefits of players who retired from 1947 through 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Nederlander backed off criticizing Steinbrenner's free spending on free agents 
and revolving-door hirings and firings, but said the Yankees will rebuild the 
farm system and "will operate in a fiscally responsible manner." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to field the best team we can and try to bring the pennant 
to New York," he said. "In my opinion, with all deference to other clubs, I 
believe the New York Yankees franchise is the greatest in the world, and I'm 
going to do everything I can to perpetuate that symbol." 
</P>
<P>
Hinting he won't be a headline-seeking, hands-on owner like Steinbrenner, 
Nederlander said he won't second-guess General Manager Gene Michael or Manager 
Stump Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
"My own personal philosophy is you have to give people a chance, and continuity 
is important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other news: 
</P>
<P>
Brown will stay on through December, 1992, as the AL board of directors seeks 
his replacement. A successor is to be named president-elect by Jan. 1, 1992.

Vincent reported progress in finding new local owners for the Montreal Expos.

well above the legal limit when the pickup truck he is accused of driving 
crashed and former major-league manager Billy Martin was killed.

Onondaga County Medical Examiner Erik Mitchell told a Town of Fenton Court jury 
that Reedy's blood-alcohol level as measured at a hospital immediately after 
the crash was 0.16%. The legal limit in New York for driving while intoxicated

CRIMINAL TYPE LOOKS NEAR UNBEATABLE FOR HORSE-OF-YEAR HONOR 
</P>

<P>
Housebuster and Go for Wand are on his heels in the Horse-of-the-Year race, but 
with the Breeders' Cup approaching, the title is Criminal Type's to lose. It 
has been so since his victories over Easy Goer in the Met Mile and Sunday 
Silence in the Hollywood Gold Cup were followed by the retirements of both. 
Suddenly, the muscular, deep-girthed Criminal Type, a 5-year-old who has taken 
late development to a new frontier, was alone and brandishing a streak of three 
Grade I victories going into the Whitney Handicap on Aug. 4 at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
Five opposed him that day, none with a prayer of outrunning the former middling 
allowance horse turned behemoth of the handicap division. This is an animal who 
was anonymous at age 2, nondescript at 3 and forgettable at 4, when he earned 
less than $67,000. But by midsummer of his fifth year, Criminal Type looked 
unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
Having won hard-fought, photo-finish decisions over Housebuster in the Met Mile 
and Sunday Silence in the Hollywood Gold Cup, he won the Whitney as he pleased 
in a quickly run 9 furlongs, an effort comparable to his other victories. 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's Woodward Handicap, Criminal Type will encounter Rhythm, winner of 
the Travers Stakes, the high point of a largely disappointing season for last 
year's 2-year-old champion; Dispersal, who has not raced in New York since 
taking the NYRA Mile last fall at Aqueduct but who is on a more modest streak 
of his own; two California shippers who may have Breeders' Cup aspirations; 
Thirty Six Red, who has spent the summer attempting to recapture his spring 
form, and a few others whose prospects appear dim at best. 
</P>
<P>
On paper, the Woodward looks much like a repeat of the Whitney. The distance, 9 
furlongs, is probably Criminal Type's best, and the stakes are much larger than 
the winner's share of a $500,000 purse. 
</P>
<P>
A Woodward victory would be of substantial importance to Criminal Type's 
Horse-of-the-Year prospects and his value as a progenitor of the breed for his 
owner, Calumet Farm. It also increases the already considerable value of his 
wildly successful sire, Alydar, who stands at Calumet. 
</P>
<P>
A loss in a race Criminal Type is expected to win easily could be overcome in 
the Jockey Club Gold Cup and Breeders' Cup Classic. A defeat, however, would 
allow no margin for setback in light of the seasons being enjoyed by the 
3-year-old filly Go for Wand and Housebuster, who in many eyes became the 
leading 3-year-old male with his overpowering performance in the Jerome 
Handicap despite his absence from the Triple Crown and the Travers. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodward is the first significant race of the fall meeting at Belmont that 
has substantial Breeders' Cup implications. Rhythm, winner of the Breeders' Cup 
Juvenile last year, is a candidate for the Classic but must duplicate his 
come-from-behind Travers effort if he is to be taken seriously as a threat. Not 
even his connections are certain he will. 
</P>
<P>
Having coped with an erratic Rhythm, who raced close to the pace throughout the 
summer, trainer Shug McGaughey and jockey Craig Perret elected to allow the 
colt to relax early and finish with one long run, which resulted in a solid if 
not altogether convincing victory. It worked at Saratoga. "Now, we have to hope 
it will work again," McGaughey said. 
</P>
<P>
But like the ultimate title that trainer D. Wayne Lukas and Calumet Farm seek 
for Criminal Type, the Woodward is his to lose. Criminal Type put a signature 
to the preparation Tuesday with a 5-furlong move in 0:59 2/5 that was almost 
effortless. "He's been working fast since the Whitney," assistant trainer Jeff 
Lukas said. "It falls into his pattern. He's been a good work horse in the last 
four or five months." 
</P>
<P>
In the last four or five months, he's been an indomitable racehorse.

<P>
There will be one non-wagering race, the first trial to the Pacific Coast 
Quarter Horse Breeders Assn. Futurity, at noon. Later in the day, 2-year-old 
colts and geldings meet in the Beau Brummel at 6 1/2 furlongs. Ten horses are 
entered, including an entry.

Actress Esther Rolle is recovering at home in Los Angeles, sifting through 
script offers and thanking friends for their support one month after being 
seriously injured in an auto accident, a spokeswoman says. 
</P>
<P>
"She's doing so much better," Michelle Marx said Wednesday after visiting the 
69-year-old Miss Rolle. 
</P>
<P>
The actress was a passenger in a car that rolled over on a highway Aug. 12, 
killing a 70-year-old Texas woman. Miss Rolle suffered cuts on her head and 
face, broken ribs and a bruised heart. She left the hospital Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"She's sitting up, but her ribs are still very painful. You can't laugh. No 
sneezing allowed," Marx said. "It takes six weeks to six months with ribs. She 
seems to be a quick healer, though." 
</P>
<P>
Miss Rolle's credits include the TV series "Good Times" and the movie "Driving 
Miss Daisy."

LIZ SMITH: BETTE MIDLER STANDS IN FOR LIZ TAYLOR AT AIDS AWARDS

ELIZABETH TAYLOR'S painful bout with dental surgery put her out of commission 
and prevented the star from appearing at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles 
last Friday. She had been expected to present Madonna with the AIDS Project 
Commitment to Life Award. (Bette Midler did the honors, riotously). 
</P>
<P>
Before this latest health woe, Miz Liz was continuing cheerfully as Malibu's 
grandest hostess in these waning days of summer. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Elizabeth threw a few more ribs on the barbecue for such good friends 
as Nancy Reagan, Barbara and Marvin Davis and -- despite continuing rumors that 
their marriage is shaky -- Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager. At this "do" 
they were very much together and affectionate. Along with the ribs, Elizabeth 
presented cold turkey and elaborate salads. 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of Elizabeth -- Delta Burke is, to this month's Ladies Home 
Journal. Delta, who looked terrific and trimmed down on the Miss America 
pageant, where she served as a judge, tells LHJ that during the peak of the 
tabloid attacks on her, Elizabeth sent a handwritten note. Taylor encouraged 
Delta to be brave and not let the rumors depress her. Burke reveals that "Oprah 
Winfrey also sent me a note, but this one (from E.T.) is like a letter from 
God." And the "Designing Women" femme fatale concludes by saying she knows 
she's going to triumph over all her troubles, because "I have to. Do you think 
I want to let Elizabeth Taylor down?" 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE ARE still talking about Madonna's campy, raunchy, period dress version 
of "Vogue" on the MTV Awards. 
</P>
<P>
It might interest you to know that the elaborate gown in which Madonna did her 
stuff was once worn by another beautiful blond star -- Michelle Pfeiffer in 
"Dangerous Liaisons." In that movie, Michelle played a modest, weepy, virtuous 
young woman led to ruin by an incorrigible roue. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna gave that gown a new life!

The San Francisco Opera Orchestra ratified a new contract Wednesday, ending a 
dispute that delayed the start of the 1990 season more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
Liza Hirsch DuBrul, a lawyer representing the orchestra, would not disclose the 
margin of approval but said "it was a very strong vote." 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's 69 musicians gave tentative approval to the pact Sunday, after 
several days of intense negotiations, and rehearsals resumed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Opera spokesman Jon Finck said the opera's board of directors unanimously 
approved the contract Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The contract dispute prompted the opera to cancel opening night's performance 
of Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Puccini's "Suor Angelica" on Sept. 7. 
Subsequent performances through Friday also were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
But after the orchestra tentatively approved the opera's latest contract offer, 
opening night was rescheduled for Saturday with a performance of Verdi's 
"Rigoletto." 
</P>
<P>
The traditional opening night gala, a glittering fund-raiser for the opera's 
educational programs, also was canceled but has been reset for Nov. 5.

RESIDENTS OPPOSE PLANS FOR COMPLEX

<P>
Despite the pleas of neighboring residents, the city Planning Commission 
approved plans for a Whittier Boulevard auto repair complex on the city's 
western side. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought they'd put in a business that would vomit noise and fumes into 
my back yard," said Joseph Gorman, a 27-year resident whose home is near the 
auto repair shop. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the service center call for three one-story buildings containing six 
business units and totaling nearly 20,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Syrie Louderman, another resident of West Linda Avenue, told the commission 
that she circulated a petition among homeowners and found a "groundswell of 
opposition." 
</P>
<P>
The petition, bearing 27 signatures, cites noise, air pollution and aesthetics 
as reasons for denying the project. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of the project said it fits the existing land-use requirements 
for the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in conformance with the general plan," said Bill Handley, the project's 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Several commissioners sympathized with the sentiments of neighbors but 
suggested there was no legal basis for denying the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Since it complies with all city requirements I have to be in favor of this 
proposal," Commissioner Charles Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Paul Thornburg agreed. "I have no choice but to approve it, even 
though I'd rather not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner David Cheverton was the lone dissenting vote. Although he 
initially proposed amendments to the list of conditions applied to the project, 
Cheverton ultimately voted against approval. 
</P>
<P>
The amendments, which were ultimately included in the approval, restrict 
operating hours to 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday, disallow bay doors 
facing the residences and forbid auto body work or spray painting in any of the 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburg told the residents that they have 10 days to appeal the decision to 
the City Council. The neighbors gathered outside City Hall after the hearing to 
plan their strategy. Gorman announced that there would be an appeal. DAVID F.

GATHERING TO DISCUSS S.E. ASIANS A FIRST

<P>
In the first conference of its type in Orange County, law enforcement officers, 
government officials and civic leaders met Wednesday to discuss ways to 
overcome cultural obstacles faced by police when fighting crime in the county's 
large Southeast Asian community. 
</P>
<P>
Under the auspices of the Orange County Human Relations Commission and the U.S. 
Justice Department, more than 200 participants convened in a series of panel 
discussions at the Garden Grove Civic Center not far from Little Saigon, the 
largest Vietnamese business center in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to make a beginning and bring together law enforcement and the 
Southeast Asian community. We hope this will provide a chance to identify 
problems and goals," said Barbara Considine of the Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is home to about 130,000 Southeast Asian immigrants, mostly 
concentrated in Westminster and Garden Grove. Police departments in both cities 
have developed specialized units and educational programs to fight crime in 
Laotian, Vietnamese and Cambodian neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Considine said the conference's recommendations to improve police relations in 
the Southeast Asian community will be formalized in a report by the U.S. 
Justice Department for national distribution. 
</P>
<P>
For almost eight hours, panelists addressed a wide range of both cultural and 
criminal problems encountered by police. They cited increasing gang activity by 
Southeast Asians, drug use, auto theft rings and violent crime often 
perpetuated by highly mobile youths who flee to other parts of the country.

Asian crime experts said the gang situation is expected to worsen as the newest 
immigrants from Southeast Asia arrive in United States. About 1,000 a month 
settle in Orange County.

Unlike the educated and professional class that immigrated immediately after 
the Vietnam War, the latest arrivals are often poor, uneducated youths who do 
not have families -- characteristics that make them particularly susceptible to 
gang recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the immigrants are hampered by language barriers, ignorance of the 
court system and cultural differences. Police themselves have to deal with a 
lack of cooperation by Southeast Asian crime victims and difficulties 
recruiting Southeast Asians for police work. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, law enforcement officials said, Southeast Asians are 
hesitant to report crimes or cooperate with officers because of fear of 
retaliation and a traditional mistrust of police, who were often corrupt in 
their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
To overcome the difficulties, panelists said, law enforcement must develop 
persistent public relations efforts and educational programs to develop trust 
in the Southeast Asian community. They highlighted the use of police 
substations, anonymous hotlines, bilingual programs, Asian advisory committees 
and special liaisons who keep in regular contact with business owners.

"You talk about public relations versus the law enforcement role, but you can't 
do any enforcement until they trust you and report the crime," Westminster 
Police Lt. Larry Woessner said. DAN WEIKEL
