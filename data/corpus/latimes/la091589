SAN DIEGO PARK FUNDS RESTORED IN LAST-MINUTE PACKAGE OF BILLS

<P>
A $48.2-million "pork barrel" package, agreed to by the governor and 
legislative leaders, restores a healthy chunk of last-minute money for San 
Diego County park projects originally dropped from the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County projects account for $8.6 million of the entire package and 
include money for major public acquisitions of land ranging in or near the Otay 
River Valley in the South Bay, the popular Old Town State Park and the Torrey 
Pines State Beach and Reserve in North County. 
</P>
<P>
The entire package, amended into legislation on the Senate floor late Wednesday 
and expected to be approved by the Assembly tonight, is the product of two 
months of negotiations among Democratic and Republican leaders and Gov. George 
Deukmejian's staff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basic Accord Noted 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, confirmed that "there is a basic 
agreement between the governor's office and the legislative leadership" to set 
aside funds for projects, many of which Deukmejian vetoed in July from the 
state budget. 
</P>
<P>
In his budget veto message, the governor indicated that he objected to the fact 
that many of the projects "were inserted into the budget at the last minute and 
hadn't been reviewed by the state Department of Parks and Recreation." 
</P>
<P>
Brett said the review is now taking place and cautioned that some of the 
projects still could be deleted from the bill. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, it has become a tradition of sorts for similar legislation, 
also known around the Capitol as a "Christmas tree" bill, to be cobbled 
together in the final weeks of the session. Such bills allow the state's 120 
lawmakers to cite specific projects that they won for their constituents back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The $48.2 million was split four ways among the Democratic and Republican 
caucuses of each house, according to legislative staffers close to the 
negotiations. The funds are from a variety of sources, including the new 
Proposition 99 cigarette tax revenues, highway funds, the Proposition 70 park 
bond of 1988 and park bonds from earlier years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large Chunk for Old Town 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's slice is a considerable one and restores many pet projects that 
Deukmejian had axed from the budget. They include: 
</P>
<P>
* $2.75 million to buy the Bohannon Pottery Village near the Old Town State 
Park. The 1.5 acres, situated between a parking structure and the park, have 
been sought by Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) to serve as an entry to 
the popular tourist spot. If the state had not come up with the money for the 
village this year, its owner would have proceeded to build a hotel on the 
property, Killea staffers said. 
</P>
<P>
* An additional $135,000 to build more comfort stations at Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
* $1.5 million to buy and preserve as an open-space park in the Otay River 
Valley, an area that stretches 11 miles from Otay Lakes to the southern end of 
the San Diego Bay. The park is expected to have equestrian and hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
* $1 million to develop 25 acres along Mission Bay's southern shore. This 
development, the first of an expected 102-acre parcel, is intended to take the 
pressure off other parts of one of San Diego's prime tourist attractions, which 
draws an estimated 15.5 million people a year. 
</P>
<P>
* $900,000 to build a ranger's station and visitors center in the Mission 
Trails Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
* $1.8 million to buy 2.15 acres near Torrey Pines State Beach and Reserve. The 
scenic property, known as Sunset Del Mar and openly coveted by 
environmentalists, is owned by former San Diego Charger Lance Alworth and sits 
between Camino del Mar and Carmel Valley Road. 
</P>
<P>
* $300,000 to build a 1/3-mile extension of a seawall near the Agua Hediona 
Lagoon in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
* $50,000 to help develop and build the San Diego Filipino Center in National 
City. 
</P>
<P>
* $100,000 for the San Diego Railroad Museum in Campo. 
</P>
<P>
* $75,000 to fund the San Diego Bay Interagency Panel, a multiagency group 
convened to solve the problem of contamination in the waterway. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the San Diego projects, one potentially controversial provision 
addresses the dispute over how to preserve the rare spotted owl and other 
wildlife without putting loggers out of business. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal provides about $400,000 for a task force to study the impact of 
cutting timber on the habitat of wildlife, including the spotted owl. 
Supporters expect the funds to be repaid partly by timber companies, which 
would use the data to develop plans for logging. 
</P>
<P>
Other big winners in the package are three new museums. The proposal earmarks 
$300,000 in seed money for a proposed Latino History Museum in the Los Angeles 
area, which would serve as a showcase for the history, culture and 
contributions of Latinos in California. 
</P>
<P>
The package also sets aside $200,000 for a Northern California Afro-American 
Museum and $1 million for an agriculture museum at California State University, 
Fresno. Another $1.1 million would be for preliminary plans for the California 
Citrus State Historic Park in the Riverside area. 
</P>
<P>
The lion's share of the money in the legislation is for public-works projects, 
including grants to cities for parks.

LORENZ BELL GRAHAM; WROTE OF BLACK LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lorenz Bell Graham, a former missionary, probation officer and social worker 
credited with bringing realistic black characters to young people's literature 
by building many of his tales around the English folk patois of African 
peoples, has died in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, known particularly for his "Town" series about a young black's struggle 
to overcome racism as he becomes a doctor, was 87 when he died Monday of 
cancer, his daughter, Ruth Siegrist, said. 
</P>
<P>
A one-time probation officer for Los Angeles County, Graham had lived in 
Claremont since 1970 when he joined the faculty of Cal Poly in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trip Piques Interest 
</P>
<P>
Son of a Methodist minister who traveled widely throughout the country, Graham 
accepted a teaching-missionary assignment in Liberia while still a student at 
UCLA. The journey piqued Graham's interest in things African, and he began to 
conceive the stories for which he became well known. His first, "How God Fix 
Jonah," published in 1946, was a collection of biblical tales told in Liberian 
dialect. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, he published "Tales of Momolu," an outgrowth of stories he had told to 
children about a small boy in an African village. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times wrote that, "The American reader will recognize Momolu as 
just another fellow," a judgment that Graham sought throughout his work, once 
saying that "as a Negro I grew up with fears and hatred for white people and 
came to understanding of these destructive emotions only after being outside 
the United States and separated from the 'race problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the United States where he received a bachelor's degree from 
Virginia Union University in Richmond and became an assistant to black 
historian W. E. B. DuBois. He was a social worker in New York in the 1950s, and 
in 1957 came to Los Angeles as a deputy probation officer, retiring in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uses Other Topics 
</P>
<P>
In addition to folk tales for and about young Africans, he wrote of John 
Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry and novelettes for which critics praised his 
ability to tell tales in a distinctly African way that retained the 
universalities that were his goal. 
</P>
<P>
His "Town" series ("South Town," "North Town," "Whose Town?" and "Return to 
South Town") was published from 1958 to 1976 and described the travails of the 
young black David Williams as he becomes a physician. 
</P>
<P>
"As a group," wrote critic Rudine Sims, "these books tend to celebrate the 
courage and determination of Afro-American families and individuals who are 
faced with racism, oppression or violence . . . the idea that while blacks must 
take responsibility for their own lives, blacks and whites can learn to coexist 
-- that people must be judged as individuals." 
</P>
<P>
"Someone," Graham said, "should write about the unheroic quiet ones, those who 
know the evils and feel the pain of injustice and discrimination but hold on to 
their hope and continue to struggle for a better life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Receives Many Honors 
</P>
<P>
"South Town" received a best novel award from the Child Study Assn. of America, 
one of many honors Graham received throughout his life. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, Graham was a participant in Los Angeles in what was then called Negro 
History Week and observed at a seminar that "life isn't a matter of black and 
white . . . it is more a matter of fear and hope . . . right and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, the author Ruth Morris Graham, two sons, two 
daughters, 15 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held Saturday at noon at McCarty Memorial Christian 
Church, 4101 W. Adams Blvd., Los Angeles.

WILLIAM MILLER, 80; CONGRESS DOORMAN, 'FISH BAIT' AUTHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William (Fish Bait) Miller, the affable doorkeeper of the U.S. House of 
Representatives whose stentorian "Mistuh Speakah -- the Prez-dent of the 
Yoo-nited States" echoed across the halls of Congress for nearly 25 years, has 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who opened doors for such visiting House dignitaries as the future 
queen of England (who he greeted with a "howdy ma'am") and then wrote a book 
that opened doors on the antics of congressmen, was 80 when he died Tuesday at 
his home in Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Sherrill Bumgarner, director of Hanes-Lineberry Funeral Home in Greensboro, did 
not provide a cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
In his long tenure, Miller introduced six presidents at joint sessions of 
Congress and countless other visiting statesmen to the House, letting each name 
spin forth in an elongated announcement accented by his native Mississippi 
drawl. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrote 'Fish Bait' 
</P>
<P>
The assembled Congress would then applaud and Miller would sit down at the 
front of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
What he saw and learned of the workings of Capitol Hill led to his book, "Fish 
Bait," which also included accounts of the drinking and sexual exploits of 
several members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's job came to involve more than guarding doors. He supervised 357 
employees and an annual budget of $3.5 million. From his oppulent office he 
oversaw messengers, pages, barbers and janitors. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Bait, who was assigned the sobriquet when he was 15 and still weighed only 
75 pounds, was born William Mosely Miller in Pascagoula, Miss., a small town 
that was so near the Gulf Coast that "if you go any farther south you are going 
to get your feet awfully wet." 
</P>
<P>
And Fish Bait was always two words, he told interviewers. "Capital Fish, 
Capital Bait." 
</P>
<P>
Miller first arrived in Washington in 1933 and he took a job as a clerk in the 
House post office. 
</P>
<P>
He was first named minority doorkeeper in 1947, when the Democrats lost control 
of the House. He had competition for the job in 1949, when the Democrats 
regained majority status, but he wrote personal notes to each member while his 
opponent sent a mimeographed letter. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he helped Democratic House members get their choice of offices by 
sanding his fingertips so he could identify by touch the metal disks drawn to 
determine office assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Probably his most famous moment came in 1952 when Queen Elizabeth II, then the 
crown princess of England, and her husband, Prince Philip, visited Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Miller walked up to her, said "howdy ma'am" and then proceeded to escort the 
royal duo around the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"Wave to the boys and girls in the gallery," Miller told the prince. "I will 
not," Philip replied. 
</P>
<P>
Five feet, eight inches and slightly pear shaped, Miller lost his job in 1974 
in a power switch that cost Rep. Wilbur Mills most of his influence and all his 
appointments. Mills had become publicly involved with a stripper. 
</P>
<P>
By then Miller had become a Capitol Hill legend. He prided himself on knowing 
the birthdays of most congressmen, of saying that "everyone's important here," 
of prowling the corridors of Congress in his bare feet, having left his shoes 
in the House barber shop where they were being shined. 
</P>
<P>
After the power shift, the man who once told Rep. Bella Abzug to remove her hat 
in the House (she encouraged him to perform an anatomically impossible act) 
returned to Mississippi, where he co-authored "Fish Bait," in which the lives 
and exploits of many congressmen were touched upon. He later moved to 
Greensboro to be near his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said his favorite Democrats were former President Harry S. Truman (who 
laughed away Miller's potentially damaging remarks to the royal couple) and 
longtime House Speaker Sam Rayburn. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam Rayburn's heart was as big as my head and your head put together," he once 
said. "And Truman, I liked him because he said exactly what he meant and you 
always knew exactly where he stood." 
</P>
<P>
He also had fond remembrances of Republican Richard M. Nixon, who once sent him 
a birthday card that "made me feel like sovereignty, which I ain't."

CHARLES RUSSELL; FORMER NEVADA GOVERNOR, CONGRESSMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Russell, former governor and before that Nevada's lone congressman, 
died of a heart attack Wednesday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
Russell died two days after being hospitalized for breathing problems. He had 
emphysema, a lung illness, and suffered cardiac arrest, his son Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, a Republican, was governor from 1951 to 1958, when he was defeated in 
a bid for a third term by Democrat Grant Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
He served two terms in the state Assembly, three in the state Senate and one 
term in Congress and spent several years administering the Marshall Plan in 
Europe and foreign aid programs in Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
Russell was publisher of the Ely Record between 1929 and 1946, competing 
against Vail Pittman's Ely Daily Times. The two were political rivals, with 
Russell defeating Pittman twice for governor. 
</P>
<P>
While governor, Russell pushed for creation of the state Gaming Control Board, 
the enforcement arm for the Nevada Gaming Commission, which oversees casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the control board by the 1955 Legislature was viewed by Russell as 
one of his top achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Russell is survived by his wife, Marjorie Anne, and five children.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOTEL CONSTRUCTION BAN IS EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spokesman for the owners of the closed Horseshoe Club poker casino told 
Gardena City Council members this week that plans to develop the club site 
could be delayed if the city extends its moratorium on new hotel and motel 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the council voted unanimously this week to extend the moratorium, 
imposed last September, for another year while the city staff continues to 
study whether Gardena needs to restrict the size and number of its hotels and 
motels. 
</P>
<P>
"The intent of the ordinance is a good one and a needed one," said Councilman 
Mas Fukai. "I think we have too many (motels) in this town, and I don't want to 
see any more. Unless we do this now, we are going to have a hotel we don't need 
in every block of this city." 
</P>
<P>
The city staff is studying land-use issues, including a possible requirement 
for a minimum lot size for new hotels, City Manager Kenneth Landau said. The 
report will probably be completed and submitted to the Planning Commission 
within 90 days, he said.

MALARIA CASE PROMPTS SPRAYING ALONG BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A confirmed case of malaria in the San Ysidro area has prompted County Health 
Services to begin fogging procedures today in an attempt to reduce the number 
of mosquitoes near the international border, said Gary Stephany, deputy 
director of Environmental Health Services Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The fogging will start tonight and, weather permitting, continue through the 
weekend, he said. Stephany said the fogging is in response to a high mosquito 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking this action to reduce the nuisance caused by mosquitoes and as a 
precautionary measure to minimize the possibility of malaria transmission," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fogging to administer pyrethrins, an insecticide registered with the 
Environmental Protection Agency, will be conducted between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m., 
said Stephany.

S.D. CHIDED FOR LACK OF HELP FOR AIDS VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego has a reputation of running away from helping AIDS victims, the 
leader of a national organization that helps AIDS sufferers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Merdian, executive director of the National Assn. of People with AIDS, 
made the statement in urging San Diego County organizations to work together 
more closely to help victims of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Merdian said cooperation among organizations will become more important because 
fewer federal dollars will be alloted to care for AIDS victims in the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of Volunteers Urged 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been told that San Diego is a place to run away to, to get out of 
politics and AIDS assistance work," Merdian said. "A lot of people are not 
involved here, and I find that very interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Merdian noted that his organization has many people who have either been 
diagnosed as carrying the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or as AIDS 
patients. He challenged local assistance providers to enlist as volunteers 
those directly affected by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us show that we can be productive members of society," said Merdian, who 
himself was diagnosed with AIDS in 1986. "We do have an important voice in the 
fight against AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Merdian's comments came during the start of a two-day California Assn. of AIDS 
Agencies conference under way at the U. S. Grant Hotel. His speech drew 
immediate reactions from many of the conference attendees who work helping San 
Diego-area AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Herstand, executive director of the San Diego AIDS Project, said the work 
of the various local agencies is beginning to coalesce, pointing to the 
creation of an HIV coalition, an educational task force and an AIDS assistance 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully we're putting the infighting behind us," he said. "I've seen a lot 
of collaborative efforts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Absolutely Right On' 
</P>
<P>
But Bill Freeman, executive director of the AIDS Assistance Fund of San Diego, 
said that Merdian's comments were "absolutely right on," that local agencies do 
need to pool their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about ways to work together, ways to collaborate, ways to 
coalesce," he said. "And we're finding ways to work together." 
</P>
<P>
And Lois Gail, an official with the Center for Social Services, said local AIDS 
assistance groups should worry more about making San Diego "the lead city" in 
helping victims, rather than concentrating on parochial efforts to make their 
independent groups "the lead agency." 
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation is the only way we can maintain the focus on the client," she 
said. "We need to learn to work together." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Dr. Michele Ginsberg, San Diego County chief of AIDS and 
community epidemiology, released the results of recent studies showing that the 
virus remains prevalent among homosexual males who also use intravenous drugs, 
and female prostitutes, who often have many sexual partners and drug 
addictions. 
</P>
<P>
But, on an upbeat note, she said that, although two in every 10,000 blood 
donors nationwide have been found to be carry HIV, the rate has been only 1 in 
10,000 in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very positive statement in terms of the donors and in terms of the 
safety of our community," she said.

My response to your editorial was one of sadness and surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Sad, because the editorial did not address what the bill is all about. The 
implication that the only people who support this bill are IRA members is 
simply false. The bill has already passed in 12 U.S. states in the East and the 
Midwest. It has the support of all sorts of people as diverse as Sens. Orrin 
Hatch (R-Utah), Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), to 
name a few. Are you implying that these people are also IRA supporters? 
</P>
<P>
Come on, I expect more from The Times.

MONEY SOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the administration gives money and material to foreign countries, the news 
articles should state where the funding is coming from. Is it from already 
budgeted monies? Does it come from some "discretionary" fund of the 
President's? 
</P>
<P>
For example, from which of the government's accounts do the recent grants to 
Poland and Colombia come? 
</P>
<P>
Answers are particularly appropriate in these days of battling the budget 
deficit. The Times and other media can help by detailing money sources. Those 
of us paying the bills deserve to know.

911 GUIDELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was horrified by the events which led to the shooting deaths of Maria Navarro 
and three house guests in East Los Angeles (Metro, Aug. 30). 
</P>
<P>
My heart aches for the families and children involved in the aftermath of such 
senseless murders, and also for the emergency dispatcher who followed 
established but inadequate procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, 911 operators must be given new guidelines with which to instruct 
threatened callers: 
</P>
<P>
1. Have intended victim leave location. 
</P>
<P>
2. Notify neighbors and friends to be on the lookout. 
</P>
<P>
3. Lock doors (although I believe no locks will keep a determined assailant 
out!) 
</P>
<P>
4. Ask a friend or relative (the mother, if possible) of the assailant to try 
to deter him/her. 
</P>
<P>
5. Post a prominent note on door to warn assailant of intent to self-defend, 
imminent arrival of the police, a plea to desist, etc. 
</P>
<P>
With our expertise at space exploration, we need more knowledge and commitment 
to exploring the most fascinating space of all -- the human mind: Solutions can 
be found there.

LEAF BLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I object to the blowers gardeners use to rid lawns and sidewalks of leaves. 
This act is an insult to the senses; it uses fossil fuel instead of elbow 
grease, it creates a loud, incessant noise, and it spews dust particles all 
over the neighborhood. Where do they think the debris is going? Even the trade 
of gardening has become a victim of technology. 
</P>
<P>
As a first step toward discouraging the use of these blowers, I suggest that 
each homeowner (the consumer) request that his or her gardener not use them.

'INTERVENING IN ULSTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am surprised that a newspaper that supported the more stringent Sullivan 
Principles in South Africa opposes the more modest McBride Principles 
("Intervening in Ulster," editorial, Sept. 6), which merely attempt to place 
Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland on a level playing field. 
</P>
<P>
Institutionalized religious discrimination and oppression against Roman 
Catholics are the root causes of the ongoing political instability in Northern 
Ireland. The McBride Principles combat job discrimination, the largest 
roadblock to ending unemployment and instability in Northern Ireland. After 20 
years of civil rights activism, unemployment among Catholics remains 2 1/2 
times greater than that of Protestants. 
</P>
<P>
Your point that my legislation is "potentially dangerous" is absurd. This bill 
is based on moral persuasion and corporate responsibility, not coercion. The 
measure merely requests that our state's pension fund managers, when investing 
in U.S. firms doing business in Northern Ireland, determine those firms' 
compliance to the McBride Principles of non-discrimination. I fail to see the 
potential danger of this request. 
</P>
<P>
The McBride Principles do not demand hiring quotas, as you incorrectly state, 
and the measure has stood the test of legality in both U.S. and British courts. 
</P>
<P>
You tend to make light of the employer's responsibility for workers' safety 
traveling to and from jobs. First of all, that provision concerns safe travel 
to and from their job after they enter the factory gates on the way to the 
workplace, where much Protestant violence against Roman Catholics has taken 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Your statement that the enactment of the McBride Principles will deter 
investment in Northern Ireland is not true. The McBride Principles did not 
become operative until 1986, yet new investment stopped in 1982 as a result of 
violence and instability. 
</P>
<P>
You also buy into the British red herring of somehow making the McBride 
Principles a pro-IRA measure. In fact, the supporters of the McBride Principles 
are Charles Haughey, prime minister of Ireland, Cardinal O'Fiach, Catholic 
primate of Ireland, the British Labor Party, every major academic institution 
in Ireland, every women's group, every grass-roots and working class Catholic 
organization in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the governor ignores these desperate claims and reads instead the many 
letters of support from Irish-Americans and others throughout the state.

SOUR FALLOUT FROM L.A. TEACHERS' BONANZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE E. LOMAX and TED D. KIMBROUGH, Melanie E. Lomax is an attorney and 
represents public school districts including Compton. Ted D. Kimbrough is the 
superintendent of schools for the Compton Unified School District. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For historically underpaid teachers, the new contract with the Los Angeles 
Board of Education is a welcome first step toward more adequate compensation. 
However, the financial obligations imposed on the district by this settlement 
do not bode well for its budgetary future. In addition, teachers from the 
surrounding districts are already flocking to Los Angeles, where the bigger 
money is, leaving neighboring districts facing severe shortages. 
</P>
<P>
As if these were not troubles enough, there is the sobering fact that the new 
contract did not guarantee greater teacher accountability or provide funds for 
improved instruction for our students. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, annual salary increases for teachers have been limited to the 
cost-of-living increase in the funds the state provides. Last year, this was 
4.1%. This year it is 4.6%. But to end a strike that was costly to students and 
disturbing to the public, the school board agreed in June to give its teachers 
salary increases of 24%, at a rate of 8% per year over three years. This is 
almost twice the state's provision. 
</P>
<P>
The funds to meet the higher salaries are coming from cost savings achieved by 
cutting programs, from lottery funds, (which the state discourages districts 
from using for fixed costs), from strike savings, contingency funds and staff 
reductions. But there is only so much that can be cut, given the large 
percentage of the district's budget that salaries take, and the resources 
available for students' instruction are certain to be diminished by this 
financial crunch. 
</P>
<P>
A related problem is that the contract is already having an adverse impact on 
the dozensof school districts in Los Angeles County, as teachers defect to L.A. 
Unified. Compton, Lynwood and Torrance are among the many more school districts 
experiencing major teacher losses. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Unified has become a raider, hiring some of the area's best teachers, 
particularly those trained in math, science and bilingual education. The 
Compton Unified School District has lost more than 65 teachers to Los Angeles 
this semester alone. Teachers submitting their resignations said plainly they 
were leaving to work for Los Angeles because those $5,000 to $10,000 annual 
increases proved an irresistible lure. 
</P>
<P>
Although other districts cannot afford to match the L.A. Unified contract terms 
because they do not have the resources to juggle to pay the costs, their 
teachers and their union representatives are using the Los Angeles contract as 
the benchmark for their own negotiations and are asking for the same pay 
increases. This puts an unfair burden, fiscally and educationally, on other 
districts, which must make serious cuts in their programs and/or lay off other 
needed personnel if they are to pay teachers more than the state-provided 
cost-of-living increases. 
</P>
<P>
The state must avert what is surely an impending disaster to the dozens of 
districts neighboring L.A. Unified by raising the cost-of-living increases for 
teacher salaries this year, either just in Los Angeles County or throughout the 
state, and continuing to do so until teachers are receiving professional 
salaries. Supplemental funds must also be allocated by the state as direct 
funding for salaries. For example, Compton, the 14th-largest school district in 
the state, needs at least $20 million this year to remain competitive with Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. Unified contract has another serious flaw. Teachers were not held to 
any higher degree of accountability for the quality of instruction in exchange 
for the district's concession on wages. 
</P>
<P>
Educators in L.A. Unified and all the other 91 districts in the county must 
understand that they cannot be well-paid and receive joint decision-making 
powers without assuming greater accountability for the teaching of our 
children. They should, for instance, be required to make specific numbers of 
home contacts, and to reach goals for the academic achievement of students and 
for parent involvement. 
</P>
<P>
California at one time led the nation in quality education. Today, the test 
scores and academic achievements of our students are at an all-time low. 
Educators must redouble their efforts to reverse this trend, and parents and 
the community must raise their expectations and insist on results. 
</P>
<P>
We all welcome higher pay for teachers, but it should not come at the expense 
of programs for students. Nor should it be granted without assurances that 
educators will do a better job. And clearly, students in school districts 
outside Los Angeles need and deserve quality educational opportunities, which 
they will not receive if the present teacher drain continues.

NOW THE TECHNO-SNOOPERS WANT TO GET INTO OUR GENES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY T. MARX, Gary T. Marx, a sociology professor at MIT, is the author of 
Undercover: Police Surveillance in America (University of California Press, 
1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Move over Buck Rogers, Dick Tracy and Mr. Spock. Space-age technology has come 
to the criminal justice system. Recent developments in forensic molecular 
biology have brought us DNA "fingerprinting," a technique that its advocates 
claim offers certainty in the matching of genetic material found at a crime 
scene with that taken from a suspect. More than half the states are exploring 
plans to create computerized genetic databases, and the FBI is seeking to build 
a national computerized DNA index, for which those convicted of serious crimes 
will be required to provide blood and saliva samples. 
</P>
<P>
This week, in California's first DNA conviction, a Ventura County woman was 
found guilty of murder in a case that rested largely on 15 hairs found at the 
scene of the crime that matched her DNA patterns. "Without the DNA test 
results," said the judge in the case, "there's not enough evidence." 
</P>
<P>
In this euphoria of quick techno-fixes, it is possible to overlook short- and 
long-range problems. There are questions about the validity of DNA testing and 
about the standards that should be required for court use. An accurate match is 
no guarantee of legal guilt, and the tactic raises Fourth Amendment search and 
property ownership questions: Under what conditions should a DNA sample have to 
be provided, and who should control the findings? 
</P>
<P>
But there is another problem -- the danger of "surveillance creep," in which an 
invasive technology, benignly introduced for limited purposes, silently extends 
beyond those borders. Examples are everywhere: the Social Security number that 
Congress intended only for tax purposes has become a de facto national ID 
number; video cameras, once restricted to prisons and high-security areas, are 
found in offices and shopping malls; the polygraph, once limited to 
national-security violations, is now routinely applied to government employees 
and contractors; drug testing, once restricted to those working in 
nuclear-power facilities, is now required of bank tellers and even junior high 
school students; a congressional restriction on matching computer databases 
only for purposes consistent with the original data collection has given way to 
widespread matching of databases for any reason government chooses; the FBI's 
records of criminal histories, created as a crime-fighting tool, are now most 
frequently used to investigate job applicants, not crime. 
</P>
<P>
Once a surveillance system is established, many factors extend it to new 
subjects and new uses. Economies of scale are created that reduce the per-unit 
cost of such extensions. Precedent is established; what was once seen as a 
shocking intrusion comes to be seen as business as usual. Interest groups lobby 
for expansion. The surveillance appetite becomes insatiable, both as a 
bureaucratic end in itself and as an insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, sometimes the camel's nose is pushed back from under the tent. 
Thus, following Watergate and revelations about the FBI's COINTEL program, 
policies were changed and the number of domestic national-security 
investigations dropped from thousands to fewer than 50 a year. Director William 
S. Sessions recently rejected a proposal to expand the FBI's automated criminal 
records system to include information on persons who were under suspicion but 
had not actually been charged with anything. But such cases of restraint are 
the exception. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of mandatory DNA fingerprinting, one can imagine its creeping from 
violent to nonviolent criminals, then to anyone having contact with the 
criminal justice system, and finally to the everyone. In the latter case, this 
might initially be voluntary and only for purposes of identification, as 
protection for missing children and for amnesia or Alzheimer's victims. Success 
with that could lead to a numerically expressed national DNA standard for all 
Americans, which could find its way onto all the documents that make up our 
"data image" in distant computers. 
</P>
<P>
New uses also may appear. There is no reason why the technique has to be 
restricted to the limited number of DNA strands used for identification. 
Information on one's complete genetic makeup will be available. This could lead 
to coercive therapy in the name of prevention, the denial of certain types of 
employment, insurance or even the right to have children by those whose genetic 
makeup indicates they may be prone to particular illnesses or forms of 
anti-social behavior. With that could come a permanently stigmatized genetic 
underclass, with enormous moral and social costs. 
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, research on recombinant DNA was suspended until appropriate 
laboratory guidelines could be developed. It might now be appropriate to have a 
social moratorium on the use of DNA databases for public-policy purposes while 
the legal, ethical, social and psychological questions are considered. With 
respect to this technology, we are now in the twilight zone that Justice 
William O. Douglas wrote about in noting that the protection of liberty is not 
self-executing: "As night-fall does not come at once, neither does oppression. 
. . . It is in such twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the 
air -- however slight -- lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness."

BACK DOOR OPENS IN THE IRON CURTAIN;

<P>
AS EAST GERMANS GET OUT, A HOST OF PROBLEMS RUSH IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EDWIN MROZ, John Edwin Mroz is founder and president of the Institute 
for East-West Security Studies, an international public-policy research center 
in New York.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Think twice before you celebrate this week's dramatic exodus of 12,000 young 
and highly skilled East German workers. 
</P>
<P>
The courageous yet almost inevitable decision of the Hungarian government to 
allow the single largest flow of refugees from the East Bloc since 1961 has 
been sympathetically welcomed by the West, tolerated by the Soviet Union and 
either praised, condemned or officially ignored by the other East European 
states. As the cloud of confusion lifts, we can begin to better understand the 
far-reaching and potentially destabilizing implications of this event. 
</P>
<P>
The last exodus of East German workers -- 47,000 strong in 1961 -- led to a 
landmark decision to construct the Berlin Wall. The events in Hungary have 
become another landmark in East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
East German authorities have denounced the Hungarian decision as "organized 
slave trading," "illegal smuggling" and "an overt attempt" by the West Germans 
to destabilize their country. The emotions on all sides are high because the 
stakes are big and the issues are among the most sensitive and potentially 
destabilizing in Europe. These include the relationship of the two German 
states to each other; the internal cohesion and viability of the Warsaw Pact; 
the status of bilateral treaties between socialist countries, and the future 
course of Soviet policy toward quarreling East European allies. The Hungarian 
decision to open a back door in the Iron Curtain will directly affect the 
coming elections in Hungary and West Germany and could well have a strong 
effect on Mikhail S. Gorbachev's position in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
The unilateral suspension by Hungary of "certain paragraphs" of the 1969 
Hungarian-East German treaty on tourism has much more to do with the future 
evolution of Eastern Europe than the obligation to prevent citizens of an 
allied country from exiting to the West without the approval of their own 
government. Hungarian authorities have rightfully invoked their international 
obligations as a signatory of the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees, 
which bans the practice of forcibly sending refugees back to countries of 
origin if they are likely to face persecution. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian decision was a carefully thought-out response to serious domestic 
pressures that could spell the fate of the leadership of the Communist Party in 
the forthcoming elections. The party leadership has committed itself to hold 
parliamentary elections, most likely in the spring, under conditions much freer 
than those that led to the humiliating setback suffered by the Polish Communist 
Party in June. Hungarian party officials estimate that at best they might 
capture 30% of the vote, with the remainder being divided among 10 opposition 
parties. One party official recently told a group of Western experts that if 
the government sent back the East German refugees against their will, "we would 
be lucky to get 5% of the vote." 
</P>
<P>
Another important consideration for Hungarian authorities was the need to 
highlight the real limitation of sovereignty on East European states -- the 
restrictive bilateral treaties that were signed by members of the Warsaw Pact 
in the immediate aftermath of the Soviet invasion in 1968. The Hungarian 
actions were in part intended to publicly raise awareness that the real danger 
is this "iceberg below the water line" and not the Brezhnev doctrine itself. 
</P>
<P>
For the German Democratic Republic, the Hungarian decision could not have come 
at a worse time. The Oct. 7 celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding 
of the East German state may take place without the presence of Erich Honecker, 
the seriously ill leader. Two decades of careful building of relations with 
West Germany could be jeopardized as the collective leadership decides what 
action to take. 
</P>
<P>
There are two major courses that can be followed. First, the close links built 
with West Germany can be preserved while a slow hemorrhaging continues -- e.g., 
the most skilled young workers continue to leave the country via the Hungarian 
back door. More likely, a hardened status quo approach will be taken, with the 
East Germans becoming increasingly isolated. Yegor K. Ligachev, the Soviet 
Politburo hard-liner who is now visiting Berlin, has publicly enunciated 
Kremlin support for its "reliable ally." Other Soviet hard-liners and members 
of the military are expected to demand increased Kremlin support for the East 
German leadership and are likely to get it. The German Democratic Republic is 
absolutely vital to Soviet security interests. Its loss would be devastating to 
the Soviet Union and would not be tolerated -- perestroika or not. 
</P>
<P>
Among the big losers may be the West Germans. Already East German and Soviet 
media are portraying the exodus of refugees as being manipulated by Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact will face a tremendously difficult task in maintaining 
civility, let alone consensus. This comes at a difficult time for reformers and 
arms-control advocates in the Kremlin who want and need a significant 
conventional arms reduction agreement in Vienna. President Bush has called for 
an agreement within the year. The opening in the Iron Curtain's back door may 
well have set back the hopes of meeting such a timetable. It will certainly 
have an impact on other dynamics under way in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in central Europe today is too fluid to allow accurate 
predictions. As a Soviet official told a group of us this week: "You wanted 
change and you're getting it." 
</P>
<P>
The question is, what do we do with it?

LOW BID BOLSTERS VENTURA FREEWAY WIDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending more than two years of delay caused by a dispute over whether to include 
a car-pool lane, bids for widening the traffic-clogged Ventura Freeway across 
the San Fernando Valley were opened Thursday, preparing the way for the start 
of construction in about two months, Caltrans officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
Highway engineers had worried that the project, estimated to cost $35.8 
million, might come in significantly over budget, forcing a new round of 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
But the low bid of $36.9 million, submitted by Tutor-Saliba Corp. of Sylmar, 
was only about 3% over the estimate by the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hallin, Caltrans' Southern California project development director, said 
that "based on the overall amount and assuming the bid meets our specification 
in other areas, it looks like the contract will be awarded." 
</P>
<P>
The 22-month project is expected to bring short-term relief to the Valley's 
main east-west artery, which has eight to 10 hours of congestion each weekday. 
</P>
<P>
However, Caltrans engineers predict that traffic generated by continuing 
development in the West Valley and Ventura County will cause a return of 
pre-widening congestion levels within one to two years after the project is 
completed in late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway, which carries 280,000 vehicles daily, is a patchwork of eight- and 
10-lane-wide sections. It is to be expanded to 10 lanes from the Hollywood 
Freeway to Topanga Canyon Boulevard, a distance of 15 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The new lanes are also to be extended south on the Hollywood Freeway to 
Lankershim Boulevard, south of which the freeway is already 10 lanes. 
</P>
<P>
New lanes will be created by narrowing the existing 12-foot-wide lanes by one 
foot each and by using part of the median. 
</P>
<P>
To lessen the impact on traffic, Caltrans officials said, most work will be 
done at night. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the proposed freeway widening has been embroiled in a bitter 
dispute over whether the fifth eastbound lane should be a "diamond lane," 
restricted to vehicles with two or more occupants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free-Flowing Diamond Lane 
</P>
<P>
Traffic engineers said that only with a free-flowing diamond lane to lure 
motorists into forming car pools will the freeway be able to handle traffic 
until the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, which is building a regional network of the restricted lanes, backed 
away from the Ventura Freeway proposal in February, 1987, citing protest 
letters from more than 12,000 people, mostly from the West Valley and Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents contend that car-pool lanes are unproved as a device for inducing 
motorists to form car pools or ride buses and that they are unfair to those who 
travel at varying times and cannot share rides. 
</P>
<P>
After Caltrans dropped the car-pool lane, the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District and the Federal Highway Administration unsuccessfully 
pressured the state agency to reverse its position. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Coalition for Clean Air filed a legally required notice of intent 
to sue to force designation of the eastbound lane for car pools and buses. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica-based group contends that the freeway car-pool lane and others 
projected throughout Southern California are needed to lower car emissions to 
meet federal clean-air standards. 
</P>
<P>
But coalition President Jan Chatten-Brown said Thursday that her group had 
abandoned plans to go to court "because the likelihood of our prevailing was 
not strong enough, although we still think a car-pool lane is very much needed 
on the Ventura Freeway." 
</P>
<P>
West of Topanga Canyon Boulevard, a smaller freeway widening project is nearing 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
The $23-million West Valley project is designed to eliminate a bottleneck where 
the freeway narrows to six lanes between Topanga Canyon and Valley Circle 
boulevards, although it has long been eight lanes wide both east and west of 
the project area. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McAlister, resident engineer of the Woodland Hills project, said the new 
lanes "probably will be open in another month, although it might be sooner."

SENATE OKS BILL TO BUILD SUBWAY LINE INTO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move cheered by San Fernando Valley homeowners, the state Senate gave 
final legislative approval Thursday to a bill that would require a proposed 
Valley extension of Metro Rail to be built underground through residential 
areas in Van Nuys, North Hollywood, Studio City and Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was touted by its author, Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), as the only 
politically palatable way to build the proposed Valley rail line. Homeowner 
groups for years have strongly opposed an aboveground line, saying it would 
split neighborhoods and create noise, congestion and safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' legislation passed the Senate despite opposition by the Los Angeles 
County Transportation Commission, which argued that the state had no business 
dictating the design of a locally funded transit project. The commission is 
building a countywide commuter-rail network primarily with proceeds from a 
half-cent sales tax increase passed by voters in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
A commission lobbyist said the Legislature's action, if ratified by Gov. George 
Deukmejian, may create legal problems for the transportation agency. He 
suggested that the commission might therefore shy away from the Valley 
extension, choosing instead to go forward with proposed South Bay or Los 
Angeles-to-Pasadena rail projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Possible Train Routes 
</P>
<P>
County transit planners are studying two possible east-west routes through the 
Valley, one paralleling the Ventura Freeway and the other following the old 
Burbank branch line of the Southern Pacific railroad. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' bill would require that either route be constructed below ground level 
in a densely populated, 3.6-mile stretch bordered by the Hollywood Freeway on 
the east and Hazeltine Avenue in Van Nuys on the west. 
</P>
<P>
In the central segment of that stretch -- between Laurel Canyon Boulevard and 
Woodman Avenue -- the route would have to be dug at least 25 feet into the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would require that any Metro Rail stop in the vicinity of Valley 
College in Van Nuys be built on the campus itself, eliminating heavy commuter 
traffic that might be created if the station were built in a nearby residential 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate action was hailed as a major victory by neighborhood activists, 
business interests and Orthodox Jewish congregations, which have several 
synagogues and other facilities along the Southern Pacific route in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"When you run something aboveground . . . through a neighborhood, you 
necessarily have split that community," said Polly Ward, president of the 
Studio City Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no good way in a community that's built up -- which all Valley 
communities are -- to avoid that. But if you run it underground, you have not 
damaged the community." 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials envision running a rail line about 16 miles from Universal 
City to Warner Center in Woodland Hills. But Robbins said that due to the heavy 
extra cost of subway construction with the planned funds, the route would have 
to end near the Van Nuys-Reseda border, making it about seven miles shorter. 
Express buses could take commuters to points farther west and north, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Opposition 
</P>
<P>
If transit officials tried to build the line aboveground, local opposition 
would be so fierce that the project could be tied up for years, Robbins said. 
But as a subway, the line would enjoy widespread community support, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county Transportation Commission is drawing up an environmental impact 
report that will evaluate the two routes, including whether the line should be 
partly or fully aboveground. 
</P>
<P>
But state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), whose district includes 
parts of Encino, complained that the subway plan would help some Valley 
residents but contains no such guarantees for those to the west. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials argued that mandating a subway in advance of the report's 
completion could be interpreted as state prejudging of the environmental 
document. 
</P>
<P>
That in turn could prompt lawsuits against the commission, giving it an 
incentive to turn away from the Valley and begin building lines elsewhere, said 
Tim Egan, commission lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins dismissed that assertion, saying the Legislature has the "power and the 
right to protect the community." 
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that acceding to residents' desires for an underground train 
would make them more likely to support a $1-billion bond issue for highway and 
transit projects slated for next year's ballot. Proceeds from those bonds could 
be used to extend the Valley line from the Van Nuys-Reseda terminus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Deukmejian spokesman said the governor had no position on the bill.

HAWTHORNE FACES LOSING A SIGN OF THE TIMES -- MATTEL'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The landmark Mattel Toys sign, for years visible to motorists traveling past 
Hawthorne on the San Diego Freeway, may soon be history. 
</P>
<P>
A Mattel Inc. spokesman said Thursday that the company is negotiating to buy a 
15-story, 330,000-square-foot office building in neighboring El Segundo to 
replace its aging corporate headquarters in Hawthorne. The company will sell 
its Hawthorne property if it moves to El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
The company, founded in Hawthorne 44 years ago, hopes to make the move by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"This specific El Segundo site is the focus of our activity at this time," 
Mattel spokesman Glenn Bozarth said Thursday. "It's a site that makes a lot of 
sense to us." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne City Manager Kenneth Jue said the city will miss Mattel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of a sad day," Jue said. "Mattel has been an identity here in 
Hawthorne since they started." 
</P>
<P>
Mattel, visible because of the giant, illuminated sign perched on top of its 
building, owns about nine acres and leases 26 more acres next to the San Diego 
Freeway. Toys, including the company's hugely successful Barbie doll, were once 
assembled at the site until manufacturing operations were moved overseas years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne officials recently earmarked the land for a massive redevelopment 
project, and Mattel had said at first it planned to renovate and occupy its 
six-story office building as part of the project. The redevelopment project 
calls for retail and office buildings, restaurants and a hotel to be built on 
the property owned and leased by Mattel. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mattel decided to pursue buying the El Segundo building and 
transferring its 1,300 employees there because of the disruptions associated 
with construction, company officials said. Also, Bozarth said, it is "more 
economical" for the company to move than to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The building that Mattel is negotiating to buy is at Grand Avenue and 
Continental Boulevard. Vacant since it was constructed in 1987, it was part of 
a larger project known as the Grandway and included a hotel and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Mattel said it would not discuss details of its negotiations with the 
building's owner, Sutter Hill Ltd. of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
As for Mattel, it wants to have a rooftop sign in El Segundo, too. Indeed, it 
has asked the city's Planning Commission to allow it to erect at least two 
500-square-foot signs on top of the building to display the company's name and 
logo.

PENINSULA SCHOOLS MERIT ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fellow citizens of the peninsula, wake up! We don't have to be just "sleeping 
sheep." This citizen attended the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Board 
meeting on Aug. 21, 1989, which dragged on until 1 a.m. I waited patiently 
about five hours to comment on the proposal to give our current superintendent 
of schools another assistant. 
</P>
<P>
When I attempted to develop a little background on why this additional layer of 
bureaucracy should not be needed if Jack Price would just do his paid job for 
the school district, this citizen was told that the tone of his comments was 
out of order and to step down. As a Southern gentleman who speaks in plain and 
direct language, I sincerely apologize if the board felt that my comments were 
a personal attack upon the superintendent. However, I do believe that my 
comments as a taxpaying citizen should be heard. 
</P>
<P>
School district enrollment has declined by 25% since Jack Price came here in 
1983; yet, his salary has increased by 34% with another raise due any time, 
retroactive to July 1. Why should a district with declining enrollment need 
another assistant superintendent? 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that you go to a school board meeting and judge for yourself. We 
citizens have an opportunity to elect three new board members this November. 
Any citizen who takes the time to get informed and vote will never be called a 
"sleeping sheep."

Bea Wilson took one of her teddy bears to an ice cream parlor and sat him down 
opposite her. "I ordered, and waited for the waiter to react, but he didn't," 
recalled the teddy bear fancier, who says 100 or so bears are overflowing her 
Lomita home. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Milam, who says she must have 300 bears by now, rides around with two of 
them in the back seat of her car, and "they wear seat belts." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Moss has scores of them in her Gardena home on sofas and chairs, and one 
is even enthroned on a portable child's potty. 
</P>
<P>
Teddy bears, which have long had homes in the hearts of millions of children 
who have cuddled them at night, have taken up residence on the sofas, chairs 
and shelves of folks old enough to have children or grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Said Wilson: "You can confide in them, and they won't tell your secrets. They 
don't eat crackers in bed, and they don't tell you anything you don't want to 
hear." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and the other women, members of the nonprofit South Bay Teddy Bear 
Society, will try to show people why teddies are so special at their annual 
show and sale Saturday at the Torrance Holiday Inn. Proceeds will buy bears for 
children in the pediatric cardiac surgery program at Memorial Hospital of Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors of teddy bears -- both hobbyists and people who make bears to sell 
-- will display everything from bear furniture to bear clothing. Some of the 
items will be for exhibit only, and hundreds of handmade bears will sell for 
prices that start at $15. The show will feature tips on making your own bear, a 
raffle with bear prizes and a bear costume contest with a country-Western 
theme. 
</P>
<P>
Though some teddies are only a few inches tall, they have turned into a giant 
hobby, according to society members, who say bears are among the top 10 of 
American collectibles and have spawned bear shops, books and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
There can be money in teddies -- some turn-of-the-century old-timers are worth 
thousands of dollars. But these women say most collectors are simply smitten by 
the soft, cuddly creatures, whether the bears sport granny glasses, wear a red, 
white and blue clown outfit, or, like the Chippendale's bear, little at all. 
</P>
<P>
"All of their faces say, 'Take me home,' " said Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
And, society members say, there's a reason why the term "care bear" has become 
so popular. 
</P>
<P>
"You go into any hospital, and you see lots of bears -- flowers, candy and 
bears," said Kathy Sandusky, a collector and maker of teddy bears who also 
works at a hospital. "They're a comforting kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
One reason the Teddy Bear Society was organized six years ago was to provide 
bears for abused and ill children as well as to senior citizens. "A bear is a 
security blanket for children in a traumatic situation," Moss said. "They're 
soft, lovable and squeezable." 
</P>
<P>
She learned about the therapeutic power of bears on a rainy day in 1985. "I was 
down and depressed," she recalled. "I saw a teddy bear and I purchased it." 
Then, in a remarkable coincidence, she passed a Holiday Inn on her way home, 
where the Teddy Bear Society's show was in progress. "I went in, and a whole 
new world opened up," Moss said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
According to society members, teddy bears came along at the turn of the 
century, both in the United States and in Germany. President Theodore (Teddy) 
Roosevelt lent his name to them in 1902, when he refused to shoot a bear cub 
that someone had herded in his direction during a hunting party. Cartoonists 
soon began showing him holding a toy bear, which forever became known as the 
"teddy bear." 
</P>
<P>
At their monthly meetings, the 25 bear society members listen to bear talks -- 
topics include how to photograph them -- and have workshops on bear-making. 
There is a bear fashion show at every meeting, and at one gathering a bear 
wedding was staged, complete with gowned bride and attendants. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there will be a Halloween party next month, with everyone, 
especially the bears, in costume. Gerald Faris What: South Bay Teddy Bear

STATUE COULD BLUR MESSAGE OF BELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a former resident of San Pedro, I fail to understand how a Gargantuan 
memorial depicting the horror side of war can ever possibly be a memorial that 
educates people how to achieve peace, which is what (Los Angeles Cultural 
Affairs) Commissioner (Alan) Sieroty has indicated he would prefer. 
</P>
<P>
Young children tend to idolize and imitate scenes such as will be depicted and 
honored, if this sculpture is placed anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
If one really wants to educate for peace rather than war, how much better it 
would be to take the ridiculous amount of money to be spent on this sculpture 
(the sculptor in his own words has shown he is not altruistic about his art) 
and establish an endowment fund to be used for scholarships for the study of 
peace in a California college. With only the interest of the fund to be used, 
the studies for attaining peace would be far more meaningful and lasting than 
any bronze statue. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Bell was a gift from the people of South Korea to the people of San 
Pedro. It is a far more vast meaning for peace than any picture depicting war 
could ever mean. 
</P>
<P>
To dwarf that beautiful serene memorial would not only demean its meaning, but 
overpower it. The bell is visible from afar. To confuse visitors would only 
lessen the real reason of peace and friendship. 
</P>
<P>
Please reconsider and get the whole war scene memorial completely out of San 
Pedro.

WATER-CLEANING PROPOSAL ADVANCES; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS OK MONEY FOR KEY PART IN ANTI-POLLUTION SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A pilot project to clean up contaminated San Fernando Valley ground water moved 
a step forward Thursday when Los Angeles water officials approved a contract 
for a key component of the $1-million treatment system. 
</P>
<P>
The system will use ozone and hydrogen peroxide to remove chemical solvents 
from ground water in North Hollywood, where tainted city water wells have been 
designated for cleanup under the federal Superfund program. The $450,000 
contract approved by the Board of Water and Power Commissioners, which sets 
policy for the Department of Water and Power, is for purchase of an ozone 
generator. 
</P>
<P>
The approval demonstrates the DWP's "goal of utilizing efficient and 
environmentally sound treatment technologies to remove contaminants from the 
San Fernando Valley ground-water basin," said board president Rick J. Caruso. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment system, designed to cleanse about 3 million gallons of water per 
day, is to be completed next summer next to two contaminated DWP wells in the 
11400 block of Vanowen Street. DWP officials hope that the system will prove 
better than air stripping, a more conventional treatment method already in 
limited use in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Ask Help 
</P>
<P>
The DWP expects to go it alone on the pilot project, but may later ask the U. 
S. Environmental Protection Agency to fund a full-scale ozone-peroxide system 
as part of the Superfund cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"If it does prove to be as effective as we think, we will try in the future to 
expand its use and possibly get Superfund assistance for its use at other 
sites," DWP spokeswoman Mindy Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
A large area of the East Valley has been designated for Superfund cleanup 
because of pollution of wells tapped by the DWP, the cities of Burbank and 
Glendale, and the Crescenta Valley County Water District. The principal 
contaminants -- the solvents trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, or TCE 
and PCE -- are present at low levels, but many wells have been idled to assure 
that tap water meets health standards. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP relies on Valley ground water for 15% of the city's water supply. 
Valley water is blended with supplies from the Owens Valley and served to 
customers on the south side of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Air-Stripping Plant 
</P>
<P>
Near the site of the ozone-peroxide project, the DWP in March began operating a 
$2-million air-stripping plant built with Superfund money. The pilot stripper 
treats up to 3 million gallons of tainted water per day, releasing the solvents 
as vapors. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA is also planning a $70-million complex of air-stripping towers, capable 
of treating 18 million gallons a day, near a cluster of highly contaminated 
Burbank wells. The agency is negotiating to raise the money from 31 
Burbank-area companies it says are "potentially responsible" for the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Air strippers typically capture the released vapors in carbon filters, which 
must be recycled or disposed of as hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP is touting ozone-peroxide treatment because it reduces chemical 
pollutants to harmless byproducts -- water, carbon dioxide and chloride -- 
rather than converting them to another form of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Below Detection Limit' 
</P>
<P>
The DWP is going ahead with the project without a full environmental impact 
report despite acknowledging at a public meeting last year that the process 
could create tiny traces of other hazardous chemicals. The DWP said the 
byproducts would likely exist only in the "parts per trillion range, which is 
below the detection limit." 
</P>
<P>
The DWP also announced Thursday that its treated water during the past 12 
months has contained an average TCE level of 1.5 parts per billion. In past 
years, average concentrations have been closer to the health standard of 5 
p.p.b.

MORE STUDY ON REVITALIZATION PLAN ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skeptical of whether a plan to revitalize downtown Granada Hills would work, 
the Los Angeles Planning Commission sent the proposal back to city planners 
Thursday for more study. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for Spanish colonial-style architecture and numerous other 
landscaping and building-design standards for new development on portions of 
Chatsworth Street, Balboa Boulevard and four other commercial areas in Granada 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But planning commissioners questioned whether the cost of meeting those 
standards will cause developers to shy away from investing in the Granada Hills 
business district, which is one of several in the San Fernando Valley that has 
lost shoppers to enclosed malls in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The business district "is in need of economic revitalization," commission Vice 
President Theodore Stein Jr. said. "But there are so many hoops to jump through 
on this, I just don't think it's realistic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Santa Barbara' 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fernando Torres-Gil said: "It became clear to me that this is not 
going to work. That part of the Valley is not Santa Barbara. It's not Palm 
Springs." 
</P>
<P>
The plan design and landscaping standards are part of an attempt to make the 
business district a pedestrian-oriented shopping promenade. Similar plans have 
been proposed for other aging commercial strips in the Valley, such as 
Devonshire Street in Chatsworth, Sherman Way in Reseda and Van Nuys Boulevard 
in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Like the others, the Granada Hills plan would ban establishment of a variety of 
new businesses, such as thrift stores, pawnshops and those relating to 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the plan might not be seen for as many as 20 years, city planner 
Gordon Hamilton cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to happen overnight," said John Ciccarelli, a past president of 
the Granada Hills Chamber of Commerce and chairman of a citizens committee that 
helped formulate the plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Investigation 
</P>
<P>
But the Planning Commission elicited an admission from Hamilton that city 
planners had not investigated whether the costs of the plan's building 
standards for new commercial and multifamily residential developments might 
discourage even long-term investment. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton conceded that the Planning Department had not estimated the costs of 
many of the plan's standards, such as one that requires that the second floors 
of new apartment buildings be set back 10 feet from the first floors. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the plan heard by the commission Thursday was less ambitious than it 
was when first proposed earlier this year. The earlier proposal called for 
parking lots adjacent to single-family homes on the fringe of the business 
district, but planners eliminated that provision after residents protested at a 
public hearing in March. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission is scheduled to consider the Granada Hills plan again 
in November.

Jennifer Capriati, who at 13 is the youngest player ever in Wightman Cup 
competition, beat Clare Wood of Britain, 6-0, 6-0, Thursday night at 
Williamsburg, Va., in the second match of the annual U.S.-British women's 
tennis series. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening match, Lori McNeil won five of the last six games in the first 
set and the last five games of the second set to defeat Jo Durie, 7-5, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, ranked 154th in the world and a member of last year's British Olympic 
team, had only 17 points in the match. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans have won the last 10 meetings and lead, 50-10, in the Wightman 
Cup series, an annual team competition between the United States and Britain. 
The teams play five singles and two doubles matches. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Guillermo Perez-Roldan of Argentina defeated countryman Roberto 
Arguello, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, in the second round of the Geneva Open in 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Perez-Roldan, the only remaining seeded player, moves into the quarterfinals, 
where he will play Juan Aguilera of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In a doubles match, Thomas Muster of Austria, the world's 10th-ranked singles 
player, played his first match since he was injured in an April 1 accident in 
Key Biscayne, Fla., that resulted in major knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
A car hit Muster from behind while he was getting his equipment out of the 
trunk of his car. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the footwork is not 100%, but the doctors say the knee will be fine with 
practice and exercise," Muster said after he and Wojtek Fibak defeated Heinz 
Guenthardt of Switzerland and Balazs Taroczy of Hungary, 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (10-8). 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria beat Eva Pfaff of West Germany, 6-3, 
6-1, to advance to the quarterfinals of the $100,000 women's tournament at 
Chandler, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Elise Burgin of Baltimore beat Camille Benjamin of Bakersfield, 6-4, 5-7, 
6-1.

John Mahaffey, J.C. Snead, Jim Thorpe and Steve Pate each shot a six-under-par 
65 Thursday to take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the $700,000 
Bank of Boston tournament at Sutton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Faxon and Don Pooley were at 66 as the touring pros went on a par-breaking 
spree over the 7,110-yard Pleasant Valley Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 156 starters, 67 broke par and 21 others matched it. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Mark Calcavecchia, who won the British Open and is tuning up 
for next week's Ryder Cup matches in England, shot 67 in the afternoon after 
light sprinkles had ended and was in a group of 10 that included Bill Kratzert, 
Rex Caldwell, Blaine McCallister and Lon Hinkle. 
</P>
<P>
Three former champions at Pleasant Valley -- Wayne Levi, Mark Lye and Sam 
Randolph -- were among 15 tied at 68. 
</P>
<P>
There were 14 at 69, with 19 more another stroke back. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Watson, at Pleasant Valley for the first time since a mandatory PGA 
appearance in 1977, was at 74. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, Watson, Mark O'Meara, Paul Azinger and Chip Beck are using the 
tournament to hone their games for the Ryder Cup. O'Meara and Azinger each had 
70, and Beck shot 73. 
</P>
<P>
Mahaffey, who broke a three-year winless drought at Memphis last month, is the 
only co-leader with a victory on the tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
Snead, who will be 40 next month, was helped by an eagle-three on the 547-yard 
fourth hole. He sank a 52-foot putt to go from one stroke over to one stroke 
under par, then added five birdies without a bogey the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Thorpe, who started on the 10th tee, birdied five of his last six holes for a 
31 on his second nine. He had two birdies and one bogey on his first nine. 
</P>
<P>
Pate, who has been in the money in 21 of 26 events this year, moved into a tie 
for the lead with six birdies on the first 10 holes. However, he managed only 
pars on the last eight holes. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Furlong and Chris Johnson each shot six-under-par 66s to share the 
first-round lead in the LPGA's Safeco tournament at Kent, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Ammaccapane was alone in third at 67 and was followed by three at 68 
-- Cindy Rarick, defending champion Juli Inkster and Sue Ertl. Tied at 69 were 
Marci Bozarth, Beth Daniel, Allison Finney and Dale Eggeling. 
</P>
<P>
Furlong and Johnson played the back nine first on the 6,222-yard Meridian 
Valley Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
Furlong birdied No. 13 with a 25-foot putt, No. 16 with a 10-footer and No. 18 
from 12 feet. She added three more birdies on her incoming nine, with an 
18-foot putt on No. 3, a 10-footer on No. 5 and an eight-footer on No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a four-time winner on the LPGA Tour, rolled in birdie putts of 12 feet 
on No. 12 hole and 15 feet on No. 13. She left her six-iron tee shot four feet 
from the pin on the par-three No. 15, and hit a three-iron second shot to 
within three feet on No. 16, making birdie on both. 
</P>
<P>
Her only bogey was on No. 18, where she caught a bunker and wound up 
two-putting from 25 feet.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: OUTDATED NFL RULES ON TELEVISING GAMES SELL OUT THE 
FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If ever an early season Ram game figured to sell out in time to lift the local 
television blackout, it was Sunday's against the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
After all, this game marked the return of Eric Dickerson to Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the Colts were 4-0 during the exhibition season and lost only 
30-24 to San Francisco last weekend. And the Rams are being called Super Bowl 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Intrigue, plus a good matchup. 
</P>
<P>
Things looked promising. Even if sales ended up a few thousand tickets short by 
Thursday at 1 p.m., 72 hours before kickoff, surely someone would buy the 
remaining tickets. 
</P>
<P>
But, as The Times reported Tuesday, even if the game did sell out 72 hours in 
advance, the game couldn't be shown in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the National Football League's antiquated television policies struck 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Raiders are playing at Kansas City Sunday, NBC is required to show 
that game in Los Angeles at 10 a.m. because the NFL requires all road games be 
televised in a team's marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, also televising the Ram game because the visiting team is in the AFC, 
can't televise two games in L.A. Sunday for two reasons: (1) The Rams are 
playing at home, and (2) it is CBS' week to show a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
Don't you love those NFL policies? 
</P>
<P>
What, one has to wonder, was the NFL's thinking when it made this weekend's 
schedule? What if the Rams and Colts had sold out? 
</P>
<P>
Val Pinchbeck, the NFL's director of broadcasting who oversees the making of 
the schedule, said the league was told before the schedule came out in April 
that the Colts and Rams would not sell out. 
</P>
<P>
"We made the schedule on that assumption," Pinchbeck said Tuesday from New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Funny how things worked out. 
</P>
<P>
The game fell 8,626 tickets short of selling out by Thursday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Pinchbeck said 11,792 remained, although the day before, the Rams 
said only 9,000 were left. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an error," Pinchbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Pinchbeck reported 9,000 tickets were left. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pinchbeck: "We were confident the game would not sell out (in time to lift 
the blackout), and we have been proven right. It's really a moot point." 
</P>
<P>
Although the NFL comes away relatively unscathed from the Rams-Colts situation, 
it points to a need for new television polices next season, when a new contract 
will take effect. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the NFL eased its strict television policies, it took an act of 
Congress. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
And that was back in 1973, when Congress drafted a law that required that any 
NFL game that sold out 72 hours in advance had to be televised into the local 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The law was in effect for three years, and after that the NFL, pressured by 
Congress, adopted the 72-hour rule as a policy. 
</P>
<P>
The policy allowing just one telecast per network in a market where a game is 
being played has been in effect since the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The policy was originally designed to protect the franchises and ensure good 
attendance. It is long outdated. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, fans show up even if an NFL game is on television. 
</P>
<P>
For another, NFL teams now take home huge revenues from television. And where 
does this money come from? From fans who buy sponsors' products. 
</P>
<P>
Fans, particularly those in a two-team market where one team or the other is 
usually playing at home, are now being punished by NFL television policies. 
</P>
<P>
They deserve better. 
</P>
<P>
The 20th season of "Monday Night Football" got off to a good start, the New 
York Giants beating the Washington Redskins in a thriller, with ABC capturing a 
spectacular, low-angle shot of the winning 52-yard field goal by Raul Allegre. 
</P>
<P>
After the game was a network special on the history of "Monday Night Football," 
which, although somewhat self-serving, was interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a local show, "Monday Night Live," with newcomer Todd Donoho serving 
as host. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the show, which was pretty much of a bust, was a visit to Ram 
linebacker Kevin Greene's house in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Greene had told Donoho he was having a few friends over to watch "Monday Night 
Football." What Donoho wasn't prepared for was a full-fledged party, complete 
with scantily clad women and drinking. 
</P>
<P>
The show featured calls from viewers, and someone named Dave from Riverside was 
allowed to ask Greene a question. 
</P>
<P>
The question: "How can I get a couple of Rams tickets?" 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, Greene gave out the address for the Rams' office in Anaheim, 
complete with zip code, and said, "Write to me and I'll send you a couple of 
tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Nice gesture, but surely Greene will hear from more than one Dave from 
Riverside asking for those tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Arnie Rosenthal, general manager of FNN Sports, claims he has been ripped off 
by Channel 7 and Donoho, who used to work for him. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said "Monday Night Live" is a duplicate of "Time Out for Trivia," a 
show Donoho used to do for FNN. Both shows feature trivia questions, calls from 
viewers and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Said Donoho: "Just because Johnny Carson does an interview show from a desk, 
does that mean Pat Sajak can't do the same type of show? Plus, FNN is still 
doing 'Time Out for Trivia,' just with another host." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said he is considering legal action, but one has to wonder what the 
fuss is all about. "Monday Night Live," a campy show more suited for cable than 
a network affiliate, doesn't figure to last long. 
</P>
<P>
The first installment of "Monday Night Live" averaged only a 3.2 Nielsen 
rating, starting at a 5.0 and dropping to a 2.4 by the time it went off the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's football game, meanwhile, averaged a 15.4 rating, and the 
special that followed got a 10.1.

BUENA OFFENSE HAS NOTHING ON THOUSAND OAKS' DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is no longer just a defense. At Thousand Oaks High, it's a quest for 
perfection. 
</P>
<P>
And nobody wants to miss any of the action. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd much rather play defense," said Steve Rudisill, the Lancers' 6-foot, 
185-pound free safety who was pressed into service in the offensive backfield 
Thursday because of an injury to starting flanker Scott Barkman. "It's just a 
different kind of mental thinking. You're out there going crazy like a bunch of 
crazy dogs." 
</P>
<P>
At Ventura High, the dogs were barking again. One week after posting a shutout 
in their opener, the Lancers turned the trick again with another 27-0 drubbing 
-- this time against high-powered Buena and Coach Rick Scott. 
</P>
<P>
A Scott-coached team had not been shut out in nearly four years, since a 
scoreless tie against Saugus in 1985 when Scott was head man at Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Buena (1-1), which ran up nearly 400 yards in its opening 35-30 victory against 
Westlake, was held to 52 total yards Thursday. Thousand Oaks' defense has 
allowed 87 total yards in the Lancers' two wins. 
</P>
<P>
"We just lost our intensity," Scott said, "and got in the way of a wave." 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, waves of defensive linemen, linebackers and defensive backs. Guys like 
Rudisill, Lance Martin, Nick Ochoa and Jim Magallanes, all of whom returned -- 
along with four others -- to a defense that posted a pair of shutouts last 
season and allowed an average of 12.1 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no key. It was just execution," said Rudisill, who took over for 
Barkman after Barkman was taken away in an ambulance in the first half because 
of a neck injury. Barkman returned to watch the second half from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The defense even led the offense. Chris Foster, the defensive tackle who has 
added fullback duties to his nights of havoc, rushed for 92 yards and four 
touchdowns in 23 carries. The scoring plays -- of five, six, four and four 
yards -- always seemed to include several Bulldogs being dragged into the end 
zone with Foster. 
</P>
<P>
Rudisill added 97 yards in 11 carries and sophomore Cory Bowen had 62 yards -- 
all but two after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks led, 14-0, after a first half that was nowhere near as close as 
the score indicated. The Lancers limited Buena to minus-two yards rushing and 
25 yards passing in the first two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Bulldogs never reached Thousand Oaks territory. Buena's longest 
drive was its first, 27 yards from the Bulldog 20-yard line to the 47. But, 
after an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, Buena was forced to punt from its 35. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Isaacs' punt was blocked by Bassam Kneizeh and recovered by Neil 
McConnell on Buena's 21. 
</P>
<P>
That led to a missed field-goal attempt by Thousand Oaks, its second of the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers scored on their first possession of the second quarter to take a 
7-0 lead. Foster broke two tackles on a second-and-goal play from the five with 
9:33 left for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Less than eight minutes later, he scored from six yards, this time while 
dragging three Bulldogs with him. It made the score 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
Foster banged in again with 46 seconds left in the third quarter and finished 
off Buena with a four-yard run 57 seconds into the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks gained 384 yards in total offense, but this night again belonged 
to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Magallanes intercepted two of Isaacs' passes in the fourth quarter to preserve 
the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Isaacs completed four of 17 passes and running back Tony Williams, who 
piled up 141 yards last week, rushed for 35 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had even considered the thought of 10 shutouts, however, Rudisill 
hedged. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten?" he repeated. "That's a goal but, hey, I can't say. That would be nice."

Thousand Oaks football -- The nature of Thousand Oaks High football player 
Steve Rudisill's playing time was incorrectly reported in Friday's edition. 
</P>
<P>
Rudisill has started at tailback in both of the Lancers' games because of 
teammate Mike Lindsay's knee injury.

LA CANADA STIFLES GLENDALE, 16-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Midway through the fourth quarter of a nonleague football game Thursday night 
at La Canada High, the Glendale ball boy nervously paced the sideline and 
repeatedly issued a desperate plea: "Come on, guys, clap it up! Wake the dead!" 
</P>
<P>
The response from the sullen team was minimal. Most already sensed their 
demise. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, which mustered only two yards passing and 59 yards rushing, fell to 
La Canada, 16-0. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't get some experience from this, it's going to be a long year," 
said Glendale Coach Don Shoemaker, whose team lost its opener to Alhambra, 
19-10. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada (1-1) apparently gained something from its opening, 12-7 loss to 
Crescenta Valley. The Spartans gained 232 yards in total offense to go with a 
suffocating defensive effort. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada, which led, 10-0, at halftime, took command of the game with a drive 
that began late in the third quarter and included 13 running plays and one 
pass. Paul Traughber, who led all rushers with 82 yards in 18 carries, applied 
the finishing touch with a three-yard touchdown run a little more than a minute 
into the fourth quarter. The extra-point attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, that was a hell of a drive," La Canada Coach Nic Larez said. "It just 
snuffed them." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale mounted a rare threat on its ensuing possession, advancing to its 
45-yard line on two pass-interference penalties and a short run. But that's as 
far as the Dynamiters got before punting. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale quarterback Erik Kiesau, a junior who passed for 206 yards in his 
varsity debut last week, completed only two of six passes for 17 yards before 
being replaced in the second half by Robert Kulp. 
</P>
<P>
An apparent 39-yard touchdown pass from Kiesau to John Martell was nullified by 
a penalty in the first quarter. Later in the same series, Sang Lee missed a 
42-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of took the wind out of our sails," Shoemaker said of the failed 
drive. "And, right now, we don't have the leadership to overcome something like 
that."

DOMINANT QBS MAY SIGNAL PASSING TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Picture an endless stream of spiraling footballs, one after another, flying 
through a hazy Valley sky. The balls are delivered by a grinning figure in a 
Monroe High jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Now hear the sound of a loud alarm clock interrupting this fantasy sequence and 
telling you it's time to crawl out of bed and go to school. 
</P>
<P>
You have just entered the world of Jesse Wallace. The quarterback led Monroe to 
a 7-0 Mid-Valley League mark last year by doing nothing more than sticking the 
ball in the gut of senior tailback Curtis Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Little else was needed in '88. Scott, The Times' Valley Back of the Year, 
gained 1,934 yards and scored 18 touchdowns. He also tied a state record with 
54 carries in a game, including a state-record 22 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Result: Wallace threw the ball just 62 times in 11 games, an average of 5.6 
passes a week. 
</P>
<P>
It's a wonder his arm didn't atrophy. 
</P>
<P>
But the story took a happier turn for Wallace this year. Scott graduated. And 
first-year Coach Dave Lertzman loves Wallace's strong arm. In fact, he loves it 
so much that he's resting the team's 1989 fortunes on it. 
</P>
<P>
"You got that right on the head," Lertzman said. "As he goes, we go." 
</P>
<P>
The same can be said of the entire Mid-Valley League. The final standings 
probably will hinge on the performance of each team's starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
At Birmingham, senior Danny Larson, the most established quarterback in the 
league, may have to single-handedly lift the Braves from mediocrity into the 
title race. 
</P>
<P>
"Danny's the best quarterback I've ever coached at Birmingham High," ninth-year 
Coach Chick Epstein said. "There's no question he's our leader." 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, Larson completed 115 of 239 passes for 1,373 yards. And yet the 
Braves stumbled to a 2-7 overall record, 2-5 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Epstein is again throwing all of his stitched, leather eggs in Larson's 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, one man is not a team," he said. "But he's our leader. He's our 
captain. Playing without him would be like Sylmar without (Jerome) Casey. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a hero." 
</P>
<P>
At Monroe, Wallace fits the same bill. 
</P>
<P>
Lertzman stresses that the Vikings' fortunes will rest with Wallace physically 
and mentally. He will be counted on to call the offense this year, a new 
concept to the senior. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm asking him to do a lot more than last year," Lertzman said. "And there are 
obvious reasons why. Last year, when he handed off, it worked. But because of 
the makeup of this year's team, I'm asking him to do a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
How does all this sit with Wallace? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pleasure to call my own plays," Wallace said. "To run what I want to 
run. And I know (Lertzman) will back me up all the way, and let me know when I 
make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
But all is not sweetness and light in Sepulveda. Such new pressures have 
affected Wallace, according to his coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure he's comfortable yet with his new role," Lertzman said. "But he 
was certainly more comfortable with it yesterday than he was last week." 
</P>
<P>
At Reseda, 12th-year Coach Joel Schaeffer hears the talk about Wallace and 
Larson. But as far as he's concerned, he has a quarterback as good or better 
than either of the other two. 
</P>
<P>
On a team without a true running threat, the emergence of junior Andre Jackson 
comes just in time for Reseda. Traditionally, Schaeffer's teams are strong 
defensively. His offense in 1989, however, was questionable. 
</P>
<P>
In question, that is, until he got Jackson in pads, running the team. 
</P>
<P>
"You can mention our quarterback in the same breath with (Larson and Wallace). 
He is right there with them," Schaeffer said. "He's going to be something to 
reckon with. You're going to have to contain him on the run." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 5-foot-9, 170 pounds, is not a powerful thrower, according to 
Schaeffer, but he has the intangibles necessary to be a great high school 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been impressed with how he's running the club in a really 
responsible-type manner," Schaeffer said. "He has real good, effective 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Like the others, the quality of Jackson's season will play a large role in 
determining the quality of his team's season. 
</P>
<P>
And at Van Nuys? 
</P>
<P>
You guessed it. Quarterback Roy Vasich, a tall, healthy-armed senior, will be 
relied on to guide a team that has spent much the recent past in the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Coach Kenji Mochizuki prefers to tout his four talented running backs 
but concedes that Vasich is the glue that holds the offense together. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as important to us as Larson is to Birmingham," Mochizuki said. 
</P>
<P>
Vasich, who put in time at running back last year, offers the possibility of 
the option mixed with a "fairly strong arm," according to Mochizuki. But what 
Mochizuki really likes is Vasich's leadership ability, a quality that each of 
the coaches in the Mid-Valley League has touted in his quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in a position to lead the offense," Mochizuki said. "And he's really come 
a long way. He's impressed me with his maturity." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure Van Nuys, with 18 returning starters, is throwing its hat into the 
ring for a league title. It will be joined there by the other three teams, all 
with a chance to make an impact on a race that is nobody's oyster. 
</P>
<P>
And the best clue as to who will emerge from the fracas stands directly behind 
the center, taking snaps.

DOMINGUEZ HILLS WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM WINS, 3-0

<TEXT>
<P>
Lynor Johnson, Deonna Collins and Dena Telfair scored second-half goals 
Thursday afternoon to lead fourth-ranked Cal State Dominguez Hills past UC 
Davis, 3-0, in a women's soccer match in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Collins added two assists as the Lady Toros brought their record to 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Playing on its lower campus field for the first time this season, Dominguez 
Hills looked sluggish in the scoreless first half, although it dominated UC 
Davis (1-2-1) with a 15-3 shot advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's goal, a header, came about nine minutes into the second half off a 
crossing pass from Collins. Collins scored 11 minutes later on a break-away 
that was started by passes from Jeanine Charroux and Johnson. Telfair added the 
final score off a pass from Collins with 13 minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills plays host to sixth-ranked Sonoma State this afternoon at 2:30 
on the Toros' lower field, while UC Santa Barbara and UC Irvine meet on the 
upper campus field, also at 2:30. PAUL McLEOD

1994 CARS MUST HAVE DEVICES TO DETECT POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Air Resources Board on Thursday ordered that new cars sold in 
California beginning in 1994 feature a first-of-its-kind computerized warning 
system designed to detect pollution-producing malfunctions ranging from 
misfiring spark plugs to air coolant leaks. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded dashboard diagnostic system, which ARB staff members estimate 
could cost manufacturers $45 per vehicle, would have two major functions -- to 
improve air quality and to help mechanics repair the increasingly high-tech 
auto equipment designed to monitor and limit noxious emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The new technology was approved by a 7-0 vote following a daylong public 
hearing attended by more than 75 auto industry representatives and 
environmental advocates. ARB engineering studies chief Steve Albu said it would 
have a "greater (impact on emissions) than any other single control measure 
adopted by the board." 
</P>
<P>
Among those supporting the new regulation were the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the American 
Lung Assn. and the Automobile Club of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Mike A. Nazemi, planning manager for the AQMD, said the measure could result in 
a 50-ton-per-day reduction in air pollutants in the greater Los Angeles area -- 
10% of the region's current daily vehicular emission output. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the biggest control measure I have seen in the last few 
years," said Nazemi, who had urged the board to implement the regulation in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers for major auto makers praised the principle of expanded on-board 
diagnostics but raised technical questions about the changes and requested more 
time to put them in place. If dashboard warning lights lit up needlessly 
because of kinks in a hastily approved technology, they argued, drivers would 
quickly lose faith in the system. 
</P>
<P>
"Due to the need to develop new, unproven technology, considerable lead-time is 
needed," said Suanne K. Thomas, a staff scientist for the Motor Vehicle 
Manufacturers Assn. of the United States. "(We) recommend that implementation 
be delayed until the 1996 model year and phase-in be extended to the 1998 model 
year." 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers' group is a Detroit-based industry organization that includes 
Chrysler, Ford and General Motors among its members. 
</P>
<P>
The state board, however, decided to begin implementing the changes in 1994, 
with full compliance ordered by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure more time could give us all a higher comfort level, but in the state 
of California, we have to be aggressive," said Jananne Sharpless, board 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Board member John Lagarias quipped that the new dashboard system would provide 
for "smart (warning) lights" as opposed to the current system of "idiot 
lights." On-board monitor lights that the ARB ordered on new cars beginning in 
1988 warn drivers that they need repairs only when basic emission-related parts 
such as the fuel system malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
But the new system will be much more extensive, requiring improved monitoring 
of the fuel system but also requiring the monitoring of engine misfiring, 
catalytic converter efficiency and chlorofluorocarbon leaks in air-conditioning 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
The regulation calls for on-board computers to store data that would help 
repairmen identify the equipment that is malfunctioning. It also calls for 
standardized computer technology to allow a universal scanning tool so that any 
repair shop can have access to the data in the vehicle computer. 
</P>
<P>
The advanced system, state officials said, would result in quicker repairs of 
defective parts, thus leading to lower emissions of smog-producing 
hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide. The reductions of 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides would amount to more than 100 tons a day 
apiece statewide, according to an ARB staff report. Almost half of the 
reduction would be in the South Coast Air Basin, which includes Los Angeles, 
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
The smog reductions, officials said, would eliminate almost twice as much 
pollution as the tough standards adopted by the ARB in June to curtail tailpipe 
emissions. At that time, rules were passed to reduce carbon monoxide emissions 
from new cars by 50% and emissions of hydrocarbons by 30% by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
ARB board members said that if portions of the new technology prove unworkable, 
they can be dealt with in two years when the board's staff returns with a 
progress report.

UAL BOARD ACCEPTS PILOTS' $6.75-BILLION BUYOUT OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, accepted a $6.75-billion bid from its 
pilots and the company's management Thursday, clearing the way for the largest 
buyout ever of an American company by its employees. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, worth $300 a share, would also give a stake in the airline to British 
Airways, bringing the strong transatlantic carrier closer to its goal of 
becoming a global airline. 
</P>
<P>
Although the buyout still faces obstacles, it would represent a victory for 
United's pilots' union, which tried without success to buy the airline two 
years ago. It also would be a triumph for UAL Chairman and Chief Executive 
Stephen M. Wolf, who spearheaded the pilot-management coalition to avoid a 
takeover by Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
How strongly other United employees support the transaction is still a 
question. The airline's largest and most militant labor group, the 
International Assn. of Machinists, said that the debt-financed deal threatens 
the airline's future and "jeopardizes the livelihoods of the work force." 
</P>
<P>
And a group that claims to represent United's 40,000 non-union employees is 
considering legal action to stop the transaction. The group, called Coalition 
Acting for the Rights of Employees, is angry that the airline can unilaterally 
cut its wages to finance the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in the financial community said Thursday that the disagreements with 
the machinists and the non-contract employees could threaten the proposed 
buyout, if it is not resolved. 
</P>
<P>
United is the nation's second-largest airline, next to American Airlines. It 
was an attractive takeover target because it operates valuable Pacific routes 
and owns, rather than leases, a large fleet of aircraft. Airline industry 
analysts have said that a buyer can easily finance a bid by borrowing against 
United's airliners and landing slots. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf, in a statement, said that the buyout not only would "secure the future of 
United Airlines and its employees" but it would "provide the best value to 
shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
"As the largest U.S. employee-owned company," he continued, "United Airlines 
will keep its tradition of quality service and combine it with a new 
entrepreneurial vigor." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the largest American company owned by its employees is Avis Corp., 
the rental car company. Other companies, such as J. C. Penney and Delta Air 
Lines, have sold stock to employees, but not enough to grant control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Provisions 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the UAL board and its employees contained some unusual 
provisions that indicated the battle for the airline might not be over just 
yet. The board instructed its advisers to talk to any other possible buyers and 
provide them with information needed to make an offer. The board's advisers are 
First Boston Corp., a New York investment bank, and the New York law firm Davis 
Polk &amp; Wardell. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout offer doesn't contain any so-called "lock-up" agreements that have 
become standard in highly contested takeover battles. By giving the buyer the 
right to buy a company's most valuable possessions cheaply, these agreements 
discourage other bidders. 
</P>
<P>
These provisions apparently leave the door open to a new bid from Davis, and to 
other possible buyers. Also said to be interested in UAL is Texas investor 
Robert M. Bass, who, according to a source, held discussions this week with the 
machinists' union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Davis Still in Bidding? 
</P>
<P>
Davis, the billionaire oilman, triggered the battle for UAL six weeks ago when 
he offered to buy it for $240 a share, or $5.4 billion. He later raised his bid 
to $275 a share, and he said that he might go higher after he reviewed UAL's 
confidential financial documents, such as leases and other contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis indicated early Thursday that he wasn't prepared to raise his bid 
since he hadn't completed his examination of UAL's books. After the agreement 
was announced Thursday, however, he had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time an airline has apparently slipped by Davis, the former 
owner of 20th Century Fox. Earlier this year, he tried to buy Northwest 
Airlines, but was outbid by Los Angeles investor Alfred A. Checchi. 
</P>
<P>
The labor-management proposal would give employees a 75% stake in the airline. 
Management, including Wolf, would get 10% and British Airways would get a 15% 
stake. Although the pilots are the only labor group among the buyers, United's 
flight attendants said Thursday that they reviewed the proposal and might 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
The labor-management proposal would reportedly be financed with $7.2 billion 
loaned by a consortium of banks led by Citibank and Chase Manhattan. The funds 
would be used to finance the transaction and refinance some of UAL's 
$1.2-billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, British Airways would contribute $750 million in return for 
preferred stock, and the pilots' union would contribute $200 million from its 
pension fund. It would also receive preferred stock in return. Management, 
including Wolf and UAL Chief Financial Officer John C. Pope, would contribute 
$15 million. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots have also said that they would contribute another $250 million in 
wage concessions and increased productivity. The machinists, however, say that 
the figure is inflated. For example, $40 million of the pilot contribution 
isn't cash, but credit for lost wages during the 1985 strike. The machinists 
don't think lost wages should count as equity. 
</P>
<P>
Louis R. Schroeder, president of District 141 of the International Assn. of 
Machinists, said in a letter to UAL's board that the machinists have "no 
alternative other than to take all actions available to aggressively protect 
our members against its negative ramifications." 
</P>
<P>
The machinists could mount a legal challenge to block the transaction, or they 
could strike after their contract becomes amendable next month. 
</P>
<P>
In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL's stock closed at 
$280.50, down $2.75.

STATE SENATE REJECTS 15-DAY WAITING PERIOD TO BUY GUN 
</P>

<P>
Gun-control advocates in the state Senate lost a hard-fought battle to impose a 
15-day waiting period on the purchase of hunting rifles and shotguns Thursday 
after having scored a victory over the firearms lobby by pushing through 
legislation limiting the capacity of ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
Strongly opposed by the National Rifle Assn., but carrying the tacit support of 
Gov. George Deukmejian, the waiting-period bill failed on a 14-22 vote 
following a daylong battle. 
</P>
<P>
The clearly disgusted author, Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento), 
whose bill at one point came within three votes of passage, told reporters that 
the NRA had exerted immense pressure on the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The ammunition clip bill was finally approved after several roll calls on a 
bipartisan 21-15 vote, the bare margin required in the 40-member Senate. Then 
it was returned to the Assembly to face another expected intense fight, 
probably today, as the Legislature rushes toward a midnight adjournment of its 
1989 session. 
</P>
<P>
That measure, authored by Assemblyman Johan Klehs (D-Castro Valley), limits the 
capacity of ammunition clips in rifles to 15 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The senators' reluctance to support the waiting period bill, considered the 
most far-reaching gun-control measure of the current session, contrasted with 
the relative ease by which the Senate last spring passed the nation's first ban 
of semiautomatic assault weapons over the stiff opposition of the National 
Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Some senators who supported the assault rifle ban refused to vote to restrict 
the number of bullets in an ammunition magazine to 15, despite the appeals of 
Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), who sponsored the bill on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
"No sportsman needs a capacity of more than 15 rounds," said Davis, a hunter 
who opposed the assault gun ban. 
</P>
<P>
Davis noted that only a few hours earlier in Louisville, Ky., a printing 
company employee used an assault rifle to kill seven fellow workers before 
killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
The emotional fervor for more gun controls in California was prompted Jan. 17 
when a deranged drifter named Patrick Purdy murdered five children in a 
Stockton school yard with an assault rifle. His two AK-47 clips contained about 
50 rounds each. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the killings, Deukmejian, a long-time opponent of new gun 
controls, called for extending to rifles and shotguns the 15-day waiting period 
already required of handgun purchasers. The waiting period allows law 
enforcement authorities time to conduct a background check of the prospective 
buyer to determine whether there has been any mental illness or major criminal 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
But since the assault gun legislation was enacted last spring and the NRA 
suffered one of its worst defeats at the hands of a state legislature, 
enthusiasm to impose additional gun controls has plummeted. One top NRA 
official suggested that the switch may be due to reelection jitters by 
lawmakers in rural areas who fear the wrath of gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Provision 
</P>
<P>
In addition to establishing a waiting period for long guns, from small 
.22-caliber rifles to 12-gauge shotguns, the Connelly bill would make it more 
difficult for people involuntarily committed for psychiatric evaluations to 
purchase firearms. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also would put firearms off limits to people convicted of certain 
violent misdemeanors and would require that casual sales of all firearms, 
including those at gun shows and swap meets, be transacted through a licensed 
dealer and subject to the 15-day waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who sponsored the 
Connelly bill in the upper chamber, conceded that it would "inconvenience" gun 
buyers but insisted that it did not "constitute an infringement" on anyone's 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
"It properly balances the needs of law enforcement and society with the 
interests of the gun-owning community," Roberti said, noting that the state 
Department of Justice estimates that the bill would annually catch an 
additional 10,000 people who are not legally eligible to buy firearms. 
</P>
<P>
He said such people now get guns "and then shoot up their neighborhoods, their 
families. . . . Think about it -- 15-days to buy the most lethal weapons. Is 
that unreasonable where we would catch 10,000 people who shouldn't own these 
weapons?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Inconvenience' 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. John Doolittle of Rocklin, the Republican caucus chairman, deplored 
the bill as a "great inconvenience" to law-abiding gun buyers. He insisted that 
it would not deter criminals who "are going to buy their guns just like they 
buy their illegal drugs and keep on committing their crimes." 
</P>
<P>
The restricted ammunition clip legislation would not apply to .22-caliber 
rim-fire rifles or to competition target shooters. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield), a strong supporter of the NRA, said some 
people living in "very isolated" desert regions of his sprawling district have 
told him they fear the arrival of strangers and want no restrictions on gun 
clips. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people out here in California who may not be hunters or 
sportsmen who still would like to have the freedom of choice . . . to protect 
their homes and their families," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis retorted: "There are people who would like a machine gun, but they can't 
have it. With 15 rounds, you can scare the hell out of anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has not taken a position on the bill.

BRADLEY RATING SINKS; RESIGNATION OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley's popularity continues to plummet, but in the wake of a city 
attorney's report criticizing his conduct most Los Angeles residents do not 
want him to resign, according to The Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of 572 Los Angeles residents showed stark declines in the number who 
approve of Bradley's performance as mayor and of those who have a favorable 
impression of the five-term chief executive. Half believe the mayor has lied 
about his financial affairs and almost as many -- 45% -- said they believe that 
Bradley was guilty of a conflict of interest between his mayoral duties and his 
personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
Only half of those who voted for Bradley in his mayoral election last April 
said they would vote for him again, and one out of every five said they would 
vote for someone else if they had it to do over again. More than half said 
Bradley's effectiveness as mayor has been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
But other results showed a sense of ambivalence among Los Angeles residents: 
While almost half said they believe Bradley was guilty of a conflict of 
interest, roughly the same proportion said the mayor should not have been 
charged with criminal acts. And the respondents split nearly evenly on the 
question of whether Bradley had "let you down." 
</P>
<P>
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the poll underscored a sense of disappointment in a mayor who has 
traditionally been highly regarded for traits of honesty and integrity, said 
Times Poll director I.A. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"They're surely disappointed," Lewis said. "They used to like him." 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll was conducted Thursday night, a day after City Atty. James K. 
Hahn filed a six-count civil lawsuit against the mayor, alleging that he had 
failed to disclose major stock holdings on the statements of economic interest 
that public officials are required to file. Hahn's investigation centered on 
whether Bradley, who received consultant or adviser fees from two financial 
firms, had created a conflict of interest when he took actions that resulted in 
a benefit to the firms. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges of conflict of interest were filed against the mayor, Hahn 
said, because investigators lacked sufficient evidence. But, the city attorney 
said, "no vindication of the mayor's conduct is intended, implied or should in 
any way be inferred." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, in a 40-minute televised address and subsequent question-and-answer 
session with reporters Wednesday night, ignored Hahn's strong criticism and 
contended that he had been vindicated by the report. If Bradley was hoping 
residents would hear him out, he would have been disappointed. According to the 
survey, only a third saw or heard Bradley's City Hall address. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Findings Confirmed 
</P>
<P>
The poll results confirmed earlier findings that Bradley's political image has 
declined as publicity about his financial dealings has increased over the last 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
For example, only 41% said they approved of Bradley's handling of his job, a 
drop from 53% in a May, 1989, poll. Three years earlier, in March of 1986, when 
he was in the midst of his second unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign, almost 
three of every four residents approved of the way the mayor did his job. 
</P>
<P>
Also, 37% of respondents on Thursday said they disapprove of the way Bradley is 
doing his job, up from 30% in May and a mere 5% in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Similar patterns were seen when residents were asked whether they had a 
favorable impression of the mayor. The question is a common indicator of a 
politician's strength. 
</P>
<P>
In February of 1986, for example, 75% were favorably impressed, a percentage 
which had held virtually constant until February of this year, a month before 
the controversy over Bradley's finances erupted. But on Thursday, only 45% said 
they had a favorable impression of the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 34% Increase 
</P>
<P>
In the same time frame, the share of people who had an unfavorable impression 
of Bradley climbed from 12% to 46%. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps explaining the slide, more than half of the Los Angeles residents 
questioned by the Times Poll said Bradley "has told lies about his financial 
affairs," a notable number given Bradley's reputation for honesty. Only 19%, in 
contrast, felt the mayor had not lied. 
</P>
<P>
Most people -- 54% -- believe Bradley's political effectiveness has been 
damaged by the controversy, while only a third said he has escaped undamaged. 
Bradley himself has acknowledged the damage, most recently in a response 
Wednesday night to a reporter's question. 
</P>
<P>
But the reservoir of good feeling that has traditionally buoyed Bradley -- who 
has served for 47 years as a police officer, city councilman and mayor -- 
clearly continues to offer him support. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Bradley should resign, 54% said no. Only 31% said he should quit, 
and the rest were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Also Affected 
</P>
<P>
Besides demonstrating the serious impact the controversy has had on Bradley, 
the results of the Times Poll showed clearly that the Bradley controversy is 
casting a negative reflection on other politicians as well. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of those polled said they believe that other local government 
officials are often guilty of the same sorts of misconduct of which Bradley is 
accused. 
</P>
<P>
And no public officials -- even those most closely linked to the investigations 
-- have clearly benefitted from the controversy over the mayor's finances. 
</P>
<P>
City Controller Rick Tuttle last week blasted Bradley for "interfering" with 
his investigation into a city-funded task force run by Juanita St. John, a 
financial partner of the mayor. But 72% of the respondents said they had not 
heard enough about Tuttle to have an impression of him. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, nearly half of those polled said they have no impression of 
Councilman Michael Woo, whose committee opened hearings into the Bradley matter 
last spring. 
</P>
<P>
The two most prominent politicians associated with the probes were City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose committee has held hearings dealing with 
Bradley-related probes of the city treasurer's office, and City Atty. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine percent had a favorable impression of Yaroslavsky, compared to 17% 
who had a negative impression. Hahn was better known than his city colleagues, 
but a third of the respondents still said they had not formed an opinion of 
him. Of those who had, 44% felt favorably and 17% had an unfavorable 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
That favorable rate, however, was statistically the same as Bradley's.

One day after Mayor Tom Bradley launched an extraordinary televised defense of 
his personal financial dealings, City Council members indicated Thursday that 
they are reluctant to mount a full-scale investigation of their own into 
Bradley's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc council ethics committee, in the first official opportunity to act on 
City Atty. James K. Hahn's voluminous and critical review of Bradley's personal 
finances, rejected a proposal to hire legal advisers to review the report. 
</P>
<P>
But in a signal that the long political drama is far from over, the Los Angeles 
Police Department on Thursday served search warrants on several financial 
institutions as it pressed ahead with its investigation of Bradley business 
partner Juanita St. John. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade Group Probe 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department and the district attorney's major fraud unit are trying 
to determine if St. John, the head of an Africa trade group, misused some of 
the $400,000 in city funding the group received since 1985 with the mayor's 
help. Nearly $180,000 in withdrawals by St. John have not been accounted for, 
city auditors said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Hahn concluded a nearly six-month investigation by filing suit 
against the mayor for failing to disclose major stock holdings, but he said he 
found insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hahn said he intended "no vindication" of the mayor, who Hahn said had 
shown "indifference" to ethical concerns. 
</P>
<P>
On the larger question of Bradley and his political future, elected officials 
and the surrounding political community issued few ringing endorsements 
Thursday of the 40-minute address given by Bradley Wednesday night in response 
to the Hahn report. In it, Bradley ignored Hahn's strong criticism and declared 
that he had been exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor was secluded in private meetings Thursday and made no public 
appearances except for a luncheon arrival at the annual meeting of the Los 
Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The council's three-member ethics panel decided, without a vote, against hiring 
advisers to aid the council in an independent review of the Hahn report. That 
action contrasted with attempts by some council members earlier this year to 
have an independent counsel appointed to investigate Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also balked at forming a special panel of legal and financial 
experts who may serve on a pro bono, or free, basis despite Councilman Michael 
Woo's entreaties to fellow committee members Gloria Molina and Ruth Galanter. 
Galanter said she thought formation of a panel was "premature" and suggested 
that the committee get a briefing from Hahn before seeking any outside help. 
The panel will hold public hearings on the Hahn report sometime next week, Woo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Woo and council President John Ferraro have reached an agreement under 
which sole responsibility for reviewing the Hahn report will stay with the ad 
hoc ethics committee and will not spread to other members. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's let this thing cool off after (Wednesday's) performance," Ferraro said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the council's Budget and Finance 
Committee, said there was a "reluctance" on the part of the council to spend 
hundreds of thousands of dollars on consulting attorneys fees on an issue to 
which the city attorney's staff devoted more than five months. 
</P>
<P>
"The time to have done that would have been in April and May at the outset of 
the investigation," he said. Yaroslavsky characterized Hahn's decision not to 
press criminal charges against the mayor as "a judgment call." 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't right; he wasn't wrong," said Yaroslavsky, who had widely 
telegraphed his intention to run against Bradley earlier this year before 
dropping out months before the mayor's race. "I'm not going to second-guess 
Jimmy Hahn's judgment and I'm certainly not inclined to spend half a million 
(in consulting fees)." 
</P>
<P>
In serving Thursday's search warrants, Los Angeles Police Lt. Fred Nixon said 
detectives are looking for "any records that might shed light on the handling 
of the finances of the Africa task force" headed by St. John. 
</P>
<P>
Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, said that the initial 
warrants sought bank records of the task force and St. John but that additional 
search warrants could be issued. Gibbons declined to name the banks involved or 
the specific records sought, but some of the search warrants were served 
outside of the county. St. John's San Marino home was not searched. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon declined to characterize the possible crimes being investigated or how 
long the "important and quite likely complex" criminal investigation of the 
task force's affairs would take. 
</P>
<P>
One focus of the investigation, sources have said, is the transfer of more than 
$5,000 from the task force to accounts of the land partnership involving St. 
John and Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's attorney, Richard Hirsch, criticized the police action, saying it 
"seems like overkill" because St. John has authorized the task force's bank to 
provide records to city auditors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the police investigation, at least three local, state and 
federal agencies opened preliminary reviews Thursday of Hahn's hefty 1,600-page 
investigative report. They included the criminal division of the state attorney 
general's office, which enforces laws governing nonprofit groups such as the 
task force; the Los Angeles district attorney's special investigation unit, 
which handles political corruption cases, and the U.S. Treasury Department's 
comptroller of the currency office, which regulates firms such as Far East 
National Bank. Payments the bank made to Bradley as an adviser figured 
centrally in Hahn's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for all three agencies said they did not know how long it will be 
before they determine if further action is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a source familiar with the FBI's investigation of Bradley's 
financial dealings with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said "there is no 
resolution in sight" of the case. Agents from the FBI's Los Angeles office are 
conducting the investigation under the direction of the Justice Department's 
public integrity section in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not sense that it's even at the halfway point," said another source who 
declined to be identified. All sources agreed that the case involving Bradley 
probably will have to wait until a pending criminal case against junk bond 
specialist Michael Milken is wrapped up. 
</P>
<P>
Across the political landscape on Thursday, reverberations continued to be felt 
after the landmark Hahn and Bradley events. Bradley particularly came in for 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he put to rest all of the questions that have been dogging him 
for six months," Yaroslavsky said in a statement echoed by others. "He did not 
seem contrite in any way about what he had done. . . . It reflected a continued 
lack of understanding about why this is such a big deal ethically." 
</P>
<P>
But few were willing to write off the five-term mayor, who after losing a 
gubernatorial bid two years ago strengthened his hold on the city and 
forestalled a Yaroslavsky challenge this year. Most suggested that Bradley 
could help himself by aggressively pursuing a domestic agenda that could shift 
public attention from his difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"If he has something good to offer, he will be effective," Ferraro said. "If he 
has nothing good, then he won't be effective. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very resilient politician," Yaroslavsky added. "He's been down 
before and come back." 
</P>
<P>
But others were skeptical whether Bradley's renewed focus on problems like gang 
warfare, smog and traffic -- issues he said Wednesday night that he would 
emphasize in the future -- would serve to ingratiate him with the public. 
</P>
<P>
"What the mayor really needs is, sadly, for there to be some other crisis in 
Los Angeles to provide leadership," political pollster Arnold Steinberg said. 
Asked whether a Bradley-led assault on gang warfare would qualify as a crisis, 
Steinberg responded: "An earthquake would be better." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, like others, suggested that a spurt of activity by Bradley could 
strike the public as politically motivated. He noted that Bradley's offer to 
mediate in the recent Los Angeles teachers' strike was roundly ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't immersed himself in teachers and gangs -- it's a little late but he 
might well try to do that," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley may also benefit from a reluctance by council members to actively 
take him on on ethical matters -- either because they do not want to alienate 
his supporters or because they do not want to risk criticism of their own 
ethics, officials said.

NEAR-RECORD LOTTERY JACKPOT IS SPLIT 9 WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gamblers from San Diego to Milpitas celebrated their share in nine winning 
lotto tickets Thursday but, with so many winners, the near-record 
$56.34-million jackpot was carved into prizes of routine size. 
</P>
<P>
Each holder, or holders, of a Lotto 6/49 ticket with all six correct numbers 
out of the field of 49 won $6.2 million, said California Lottery spokesman John 
Schade. 
</P>
<P>
The prizes will be paid in annual installments of about $250,000 after taxes 
over 20 years -- a little more than would be received by a single winner of the 
game's normal jackpot of about $5 million. The estimated jackpot for Saturday 
is $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
At least one group shares one of the winning tickets, reducing their individual 
take still further. Twenty friends in a San Diego office of Pacific Bell who 
pooled their money came up with one of the winning tickets in the Wednesday 
night drawing. Splitting the prize 20 ways works out to about $12,500 each for 
20 years, after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, I made a lot of plans for the $110,000 a year I thought we'd be 
getting," said one of the San Diego winners, Rick Kruger. "Driving to work this 
morning, I heard on the radio there were nine winning tickets, so I started 
computing in my head, 'Let's see, from $110,000 to $12,000. I've got to call my 
wife and tell her not to quit her job.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another winning ticket was purchased in San Diego and two in Los Angeles, 
Schade said. The other winning tickets were bought in Milpitas, Pomona, Baker, 
Hesperia and Sherman Oaks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery was still in the process of verifying the winners Thursday 
afternoon, Schade said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Northern California men took an expensive chance at the huge lotto jackpot 
by buying more than 20,000 tickets. They failed to win the big one. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Therault and an unidentified neighbor put down $20,075 for quick-pick 
tickets -- those on which a computer picks the numbers -- at the Village Bottle 
Shop in Scotts Valley in Santa Cruz County. There were no jackpot winners in 
Scotts Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Checking Numbers 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether Therault and his neighbor had winning tickets for lesser 
amounts. He and his wife, Mary-Ann, had neighbors over Thursday night to help 
check numbers on the piles of lotto tickets. 
</P>
<P>
More than 66 million $1 tickets were purchased since last Saturday by gamblers 
hoping to beat the one-in-14-million odds of winning the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
There were 37 tickets with five of six numbers plus the bonus number. Each of 
those tickets is worth $190,611, Schade said. Fifteen of those tickets were 
purchased in Northern California and 22 in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In the no-bonus five of six category, 1,494 winners won $2,432. In the four of 
six category 74,055 players each won $44, and 1,286,909 players will collect $5 
dollars apiece for picking three correct numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The winning numbers picked in a televised drawing were 2, 32, 21, 11, 28, 19 
and the bonus number was 27.

'CHRISTMAS TREE' LEGISLATION APPROVED 
</P>

Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders have agreed to "Christmas tree" 
legislation loaded with $48.2 million for 115 pet projects, ranging from a Los 
Angeles area Latino history museum to a Huntington Beach Pier restoration and 
parkland acquisition in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is the product of two months of negotiations between Democratic 
and Republican leaders and the governor's staff. It was amended into a bill on 
the Assembly floor Thursday night after similar amendments were tucked into 
another bill on the Senate floor Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, confirmed Thursday that "there is 
a basic agreement between the governor's office and the legislative leadership" 
to set aside funds for the projects, many of which Deukmejian had vetoed from 
the state budget in July. 
</P>
<P>
In his budget veto message, the governor complained that many of the projects 
"were inserted into the budget at the last minute and hadn't been reviewed by 
the state Department of Parks and Recreation." 
</P>
<P>
Brett said the review is now taking place and cautioned that some of the 
projects could still be deleted from the proposal, which is expected to be 
acted upon before the Legislature adjourns for the year tonight. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, it has become a tradition of sorts for similar "pork-barrel" 
legislation to be cobbled together in the final weeks of the session. Such 
bills allow the state's 120 lawmakers to obtain specific projects for their 
constituents back home. 
</P>
<P>
"This has something for all our political districts," Sen. James Nielsen 
(R-Rohnert Park) told his colleagues before the Senate vote. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), who inserted the amendments in the Senate, 
said the goal of the negotiators was "to do something reasonable" and to 
partially restore Deukmejian's budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The $48.2 million was split four ways among the Democratic and Republican 
caucuses of each house, according to legislative staffers close to the 
negotiations. The funds are from a variety of sources, including the new 
Proposition 99 cigarette tax revenues, highway funds, the Proposition 70 park 
bond issue of 1988 and park bonds from earlier years. 
</P>
<P>
One potentially controversial provision in the bill amended in the Senate 
addresses the dispute over how to preserve the rare spotted owl and other 
wildlife without putting loggers out of business. The proposal provides about 
$400,000 for a task force to study the impact of cutting timber on the habitat 
of wildlife, including the spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters anticipate that the funds will be repaid, partly by timber 
companies, which will use the data to develop plans for logging operations. 
</P>
<P>
Among the big winners are three museum projects. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal earmarks $300,000 in seed money for a proposed Latino History 
Museum, which would serve as a showcase for the history, culture and 
contributions of Latinos in California. A spokesman for Assemblyman Charles 
Calderon (D-Whittier), who has been pushing for the museum, said the funds will 
go to a nonprofit group seeking to establish the facility in the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also sets aside $200,000 for a Northern California 
Afro-American Museum and $1 million for an agriculture museum at Cal State 
Fresno. Another $1.1 million is earmarked for preliminary plans for the 
California Citrus State Historic Park in the Riverside area. 
</P>
<P>
The lion's share of the money in the legislation is for public works projects, 
including grants to cities for parks. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also boosts efforts to repair piers, with $1 million going to the 
Ventura Beach Pier, $500,000 for reconstruction of the Manhattan Beach Pier and 
$1.5 million for the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Among other items in the proposal are: 
</P>
<P>
* $1.7 million for parkland acquisition for Malibu State Park. 
</P>
<P>
* $1.7 million for a variety of Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy open-space 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
* $2.7 million to buy land for an entrance way at San Diego's Old Town State 
Historic Park.

DEFENSE DISPUTE PERILS ARMS TALKS, NUNN SAYS

<P>
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) warned Thursday that 
the success of U.S.-Soviet arms reduction talks is in jeopardy unless the 
House, Senate and President Bush quickly agree on a plan for modernizing 
America's strategic nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the powerful Senate chairman has spoken out since 
House and Senate members began meeting to discuss their differences on a 
$305.5-billion defense spending bill for fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn's remarks clearly reflected a decision on his part to blame the House for 
failure of arms control talks if it does not yield to the position of the 
Senate and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The defense stalemate looms as the biggest obstacle between the President and 
Congress in resolving how the federal government will be funded in the fiscal 
year beginning Oct. 1. Unlike the Senate-passed defense bill, which the 
President generally supports, the House version sharply cuts funding for 
strategic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But, even while siding with Bush on the spending issue, Nunn faulted the 
President for failing to develop a coherent strategy for arms control talks 
with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the President's current proposal for a ban on all mobile missiles 
is inconsistent with his request to Congress for funds to deploy two mobile 
missiles -- the 10-warhead MX transported on railroad cars and the 
single-warhead Midgetman missile carried on truck beds. He called on Bush to 
revise his arms control proposal promptly. 
</P>
<P>
But Nunn seemed most disturbed about the impact on the strategic arms talks of 
the current stalemate in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the START talks are at stake in the next 30 days," he told members of 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "If we do not come out with a sensible strategic 
nuclear program that the President himself has confidence in (and) the Joint 
Chiefs have confidence in, START talks are going to be a long, long time 
coming. So we have a lot at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the House and Senate began last Friday, and congressional 
sources reported that the two houses are nowhere near an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The House passed-bill trimmed $1.7 billion from the amount sought by Bush for 
deployment of the MX missile on rail cars and eliminated funding for Midgetman. 
It also cut $1.8 billion from Bush's $4.9-billion funding request for research 
on the "Star Wars" missile defense system and put severe restrictions on 
funding for the B-2 bomber beyond fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn asserted that, by slashing funding for four major strategic programs, the 
House-passed bill eliminates much of the incentive that the Soviets now have 
for reaching an arms control agreement with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have to give President Bush the tools to do the job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted also that the House and Senate still fundamentally disagree on a 
number of conventional weapons programs. House members restored funding for 
virtually every conventional weapon that the Bush Administration sought to 
eliminate for cost-cutting reasons, including the V-22 Osprey helicopter and 
the F-14D fighter plane. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as Nunn told reporters earlier this week, the President's new 
anti-drug proposal has made it even more difficult to resolve these differences 
because the Administration and the Democrats have agreed that some of the money 
for the drug war must come from the Pentagon budget. Democrats are proposing to 
cut more from defense than Bush, however. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of both chambers have expressed support for proposals to fund the 
drug war by cutting money almost exclusively from the major strategic weapons 
that Bush wants to preserve -- particularly the super-expensive "Star Wars" and 
B-2 programs.

The government announced Thursday the arrest of two men wanted in the United 
States as cocaine traffickers and said they are in a high-security prison 
awaiting extradition. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, head of the Administrative Security Department and 
the man in charge of Colombia's anti-drug war, earlier described one of them, 
Bernardo Pelaez Roldan, as among the major drug figures in the Medellin cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Maza said that Pelaez Roldan "was much bigger" than Eduardo Martinez Romero, 
who was flown to Atlanta Sept. 6. Martinez is charged with money laundering for 
the Medellin cartel, one of the largest cocaine organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Pelaez Roldan and Guillermo Bueno Delgado were paraded before news 
photographers Thursday at the Administrative Security Department, Colombia's 
equivalent of the FBI, where officials said they had been held since their 
arrests this week. 
</P>
<P>
A department communique said Pelaez Roldan will be extradited to Detroit, where 
he is wanted for "conspiracy and distribution of cocaine." He was not, however, 
on the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's list of the 12 most-wanted 
Colombian traffickers.

4 CANADA ARRESTS HEIGHTEN FEARS OF DRUG RETALIATION

Canadian police Thursday disclosed the arrest of four South Americans near the 
U.S. border carrying automatic weapons and 9-millimeter pistols amid growing 
fears that the Medellin cocaine cartel will attempt to retaliate against a 
U.S.-backed crackdown on Colombian drug kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
The four, traveling in three cars, were arrested Wednesday by police from 
Edmundston, New Brunswick, and were found to be carrying Venezuelan passports, 
two of which were determined to be fake, according to Edmundston's deputy 
police chief, Delbert Pelletier. 
</P>
<P>
Although a grenade, tear gas, zap guns and a machete were found in the vehicles 
along with more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition for the weapons, a highly 
placed U.S. law enforcement source said: "It's not our belief that this is any 
kind of hit squad." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cocaine Smuggling Suspected 
</P>
<P>
The source, who declined to be identified by name or agency, said that the four 
are suspected of trying to smuggle cocaine into Canada. More drugs are moving 
through the New Brunswick area since interdiction was stepped up on Caribbean 
drug routes, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 
</P>
<P>
Police are searching for another suspect because a fifth Venezuelan passport 
was found in the cars, two of which had New York license plates. The other car, 
which was rented, had Canadian plates. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no story, no explanation," Pelletier said, noting that his officers 
acted on a civilian tip to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that three cars 
had been seen with suspicious people outside Edmundston, a city of about 
13,000. 
</P>
<P>
The four, who Pelletier declined to name, will be arraigned today in court in 
Edmundston on charges of possessing prohibited weapons, the deputy chief said. 
</P>
<P>
Their arsenal included an Uzi submachine gun, Soviet and Israeli assault rifles 
and a Japanese grenade that was deactivated. Maps of several Canadian locations 
and an unmarked map of Maine were found in the cars, Pelletier said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the four claimed not to speak English, but Louis Picard, an 
Edmundston lawyer representing two of the men, said that one does speak English 
and that he communicated with the other through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
"I advised them of their rights and why they were arrested and what's likely to 
happen in court," Picard said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secret Service agents Thursday asked the Senate Permanent 
Investigations subcommittee for any information that it could provide on any 
security threat to President Bush believed to be growing out of the Colombian 
drug crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
A defector from a Colombian paramilitary unit working for the Medellin cartel 
testified before the subcommittee Wednesday, saying among other things that 
Bush and subcommittee members could be targeted by the Colombian drug outlaws.

HUNGARY REBUFFS E. GERMANY ON EMIGRES 
</P>

BUDAPEST, Hungary

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As strained relations between the two nations continued Thursday, Hungary 
issued an unapologetic reply to East Germany's protest over its decision to 
allow thousands of East German citizens to emigrate to the West. 
</P>
<P>
The formal response to the East German protest came in a stiff but carefully 
argued letter presented to the East German ambassador at the Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry here Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The letter repeated the Hungarian assertion that the problem over the East 
German refugees ultimately must be settled in negotiations between East and 
West Germany. It added that Hungary will stand firm in its decision to keep its 
borders open, at least temporarily, to East Germans who want to emigrate to the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Most significantly, however, the Hungarians cited their agreement to the final 
document of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, signed in 
Vienna in January, as the basis for the decision to open the borders. 
</P>
<P>
By citing that agreement, which was also signed by East Germany, the Hungarians 
were asserting that their commitment to international agreements has taken 
priority over bilateral treaties with their socialist neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Hungarian government gave the green light at midnight Sunday, at 
least 12,000 East Germans have crossed into Austria and on to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly 10,000 made the trek, by car and bus, in the first 24 hours, the 
flow of immigrants slackened considerably, but as many as 100 people per hour 
were reported crossing at one Austrian border post Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Interior Ministry estimates that there are still about 60,000 
East Germans in Hungary, a popular summer holiday destination for East Germans. 
However, ministry spokesmen say they have no idea how many of those might be 
intending to go to the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hundreds Gather 
</P>
<P>
About 250 to 300 East Germans, most of them young and many of them carrying 
bulging backpacks and duffel bags, were gathered Thursday at the center run by 
the Maltese Cross humanitarian service at the Holy Family Church in the Buda 
hills. Wolfgang Wagner, director of the operation, said 150 were expected to 
leave by bus for the border later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been coming at the rate of between 250 and 300 a day for the last 
two days," Wagner said. "We are not sure how much longer it will go on, but the 
number seems steady." 
</P>
<P>
The exodus was prompted, in part, by Hungary's decision in May to begin 
dismantling barriers on its western border with Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The letter to the East German government made it clear that Hungary's solution 
to the East German refugee problem was taken reluctantly and only after it 
urged both Germanys to come to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"This had become a serious problem for the Hungarian nation, and it had to be 
solved," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians stressed that their decision is temporary but added that "since 
the decision was taken, the problem has not been alleviated, and therefore the 
Hungarian government will continue to act according to its decision." 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans protested Tuesday that Hungary abrogated a 1969 agreement that 
obligated both sides to return to their country of origin any citizens 
attempting to escape to the West. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians countered, in the Foreign Ministry's letter Thursday, by 
adopting the principle that the accords signed in Vienna in January take 
precedence over the 1969 treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian diplomatic sources said Thursday that they were aware, when the 
decision was taken in May to remove travel restrictions, that the problem with 
East Germany would soon follow. 
</P>
<P>
But the decision, they indicated, was a carefully calculated move aimed at 
distancing the country from its hard-line Communist commitments of the past and 
pressing its opening to the West.

LOUISVILLE MAYHEM SEEN SPURRING GUN DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVISTS ON BOTH SIDES EXPECT NEW DRIVE TO WIDEN CURBS ON ASSAULT WEAPONS

<TEXT>
<P>
With a spray of rifle fire and a trail of blood, a deranged killer in 
Louisville, Ky., on Thursday vividly brought to life nightmarish images that 
are likely to rejuvenate efforts to broaden restrictions on assault weapons, 
activists on both sides of the issue agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Some compared its potential impact to that of shootings in Stockton, Calif., 
earlier this year, where the schoolyard carnage also wrought by a man with an 
AK-47 assault rifle led Los Angeles, then California and, finally, even 
President Bush to adopt new gun control policies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate, but this is going to provide a lot of impetus to new 
legislation," said Jim Baker, the chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
For gun control advocates, the top priority remains at the federal level, where 
Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and others have been fighting to extend the 
Bush Administration's ban on foreign-made assault rifles to include 
American-made versions of the weapons as well. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to raise the public awareness that guns like the AK-47 are 
efficient for killing people -- not for use in recreational or sporting 
purposes," DeConcini said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But the mayhem in the Louisville printing plant could also give unaccustomed 
momentum to efforts in states like Kentucky, where a pro-gun state government 
has forbidden cities from enacting their own gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
While Louisville once imposed a waiting period between the purchase of guns and 
their collections, the Legislature "simply took that right away from us," Mayor 
Jerry Abramson said in an interview. "One would hope . . . that we could 
revisit the issue -- at least of assault weapons." 
</P>
<P>
A gun buyer in the city need now only be of legal age -- 18 for rifles, 21 for 
handguns -- and sign a form attesting to sanity and a clean criminal record 
before he can walk away the same day with a loaded weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Those provisions, which are the minimum allowed by federal mandates, put 
Kentucky among a dozen Southern and Western states with the least restrictive 
gun laws in the nation, gun experts said. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to deflect the expected drive to tighten those laws, the NRA's 
Baker dismissed Thursday's shooting as a "random act of violence by a madman." 
</P>
<P>
"It's our responsibility to point out that there are already thousands of gun 
laws, and law-abiding people will obey them -- by definition -- and criminals 
will not," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
But within hours of the shootings, an angry chorus of politicians, law 
enforcement officials and activists voiced renewed outrage about the status of 
current law. They pledged to redouble their efforts to extend federal 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be more and more mindless mass murders until the President and the 
Congress put controls on the sales of assault weapons," said Rep. Pete Stark 
(D-Oakland), sponsor of one of the most far-reaching anti-assault gun measures. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a classic case," said L. Stanley Chauvin, president of the American 
Bar Assn. "Assault weapons are used for no earthly purpose other than to kill 
people. As long as they are available, people will be killed." 
</P>
<P>
In the face of the outcry, pro-gun sources on Capitol Hill acknowledged that 
they were troubled. "Clearly, they (gun control advocates) are going to use 
this to try and further their cause," one aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most far-reaching legislation now under consideration at the federal 
level would stop short of outlawing assault weapons altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The measures instead would merely outlaw production and sale of all new 
weapons. As a result, the 2 million to 3 million assault weapons already in 
circulation -- including, perhaps, the AK-47 used by Louisville gunman Joseph 
T. Wesbecker Thursday -- could remain in use. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration agreed in the aftermath of the Stockton shooting to 
enforce regulations banning the importation of foreign-made assault weapons on 
grounds that they were unsuitable for sporting purposes. Previously, the 
Treasury Department had considered the rifles sporting weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But the President has steadfastly resisted pressure to extend the ban to 
include American-made weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clears Key Panel 
</P>
<P>
The DeConcini-sponsored proposal to extend the ban to the domestic sphere 
cleared a key Senate committee just before the summer recess. With activism on 
the issue fading with the memory of the Stockton massacre, there had been no 
plans until this week for a prompt vote by the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Thursday's killings, another factor now appears likely to stir 
the Senate out of its lethargy, the activists from both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government, alarmed by the discovery of large caches of 
American-made assault rifles during raids on the headquarters of drug cartels 
there, has asked the United States for help in cutting off the flow. Drug 
Enforcement Administration Chief John C. Lawn joined the call for tougher gun 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
A key supporter of such legislation, Sen. Howard E. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), took 
to the Senate floor Thursday afternoon to urge prompt action in the wake of the 
Louisville massacre. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's debate the bill, and vote it up or down," he urged. "Anything less would 
be irresponsible. It's time to act, and one more day's delay -- one more death 
-- cannot be explained."

16 MORE CAMPUSES NEEDED, JUNIOR COLLEGE BOARD TOLD 
</P>

California will need at least 16 new community college campuses by the year 
2005 to accommodate an expected increase of 400,000 students, the statewide 
Board of Governors of the two-year colleges was told Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of constructing these new campuses and expanding existing campuses to 
capacity would be $1.8 billion in current dollars, Joseph Newmyer, the system's 
vice chancellor for fiscal affairs, said at a board meeting here. 
</P>
<P>
"Staggering amounts of money" will be needed "if California is to continue to 
fund an outstanding system of higher education, we being part of it," said 
Scott W. Wylie, Board of Governors chairman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opening Due 
</P>
<P>
No specific sites were mentioned, but college officials said new campuses would 
likely be built in high-growth areas, such as the Santa Clarita Valley and in 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties, with expansions possible at existing 
campuses that still have room to grow, such as Irvine Valley College in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The University of California is seeking three new campuses by the end of this 
century to go along with the nine existing UC campuses. The 19-campus 
California State University system is asking for five new campuses by 2005, in 
addition to the San Marcos campus, in northern San Diego County, that will open 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Current enrollment at the 107 community colleges that blanket the state is 
slightly more than 1.3 million, with an average campus size of 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor David Mertes said some of the 400,000 additional students expected 
in the next 16 years can be handled by better use of existing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Building out" at existing campuses would cost about $700 million. But when all 
of that has been done, Mertes said, there will still be a need for 16 new 
campuses, enrolling about 130,000 students by the year 2005, at a cost of $1.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor noted that the community college system does not have authority 
to redirect students from crowded campuses to those with more room, as do the 
University of California and the Cal State system. Planning for the two-year 
"commuter colleges" assumes that no student must travel more than 30 minutes to 
reach a campus. 
</P>
<P>
Both Mertes and Newmyer said the projected 400,000 enrollment increase, a 
number provided by the state Department of Finance, might be too low. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Might Jump 
</P>
<P>
If state population growth continues at its present rate and if larger numbers 
of blacks, Latinos and other "under-represented minorities" decide to go to 
college, community college enrollment might jump by 550,000 by 2005, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The community college estimates, along with those of the University of 
California and the Cal State system, will be analyzed for the Legislature by 
the California Postsecondary Education Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Higher education facilities are financed through state general obligation bonds 
and revenue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The community colleges received $242 million in construction funds from bond 
measures that were approved by voters in 1986 and 1988, and they will receive a 
portion of a $900-million higher education bond proposal still pending in the 
Legislature if it is approved. 
</P>
<P>
However, that money will go to meet already existing needs not to build the new 
facilities the two-year colleges now seek.

BILL IMPLEMENTING TOBACCO INITIATIVE GOES TO GOVERNOR

Ten months after passage of Proposition 99, the anti-smoking tobacco tax 
initiative, the Senate and Assembly Thursday sent Gov. George Deukmejian a 
$1.5-billion bill implementing the measure on back-to-back lopsided votes. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyists and officials from counties, medical organizations and other health 
groups that backed Proposition 99 whooped and cheered in the hall outside the 
Assembly chamber moments after the measure won final legislative approval on a 
68-2 vote. Earlier, the Senate had approved the Proposition 99 implementation 
bill by a 38-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian is expected to sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The impromptu celebration by health advocates allowed a release of tension that 
had built up during weeks of intense bargaining by lawmakers and a threat to 
the bill posed by a last-minute lobbying effort by the tobacco industry. The 
lobbying effort keyed on a provision of the bill that directs $28.6 million 
over two years into an anti-smoking television and print advertising campaign 
aimed at California's youth. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies, said to be fearful that a television ad campaign would 
persuade more Californians to give up smoking, hoped to delete the provision 
from the bill. They won some allies in the Legislature, including Senate 
Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, who said he opposed using any of the 
advertising money for television ads because he did not think mass advertising 
was the best way to reach smokers. 
</P>
<P>
Maddy, who had dropped his objections Wednesday, carried the bill on the Senate 
floor. He said numerous compromises were made by lawmakers. But he said the 
overall benefits of the bill overrode objections to individual parts. "When you 
have $1.5 billion to give away you usually can find room for accommodations," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5 billion contained in the bill represents 2 1/2 years worth of money 
raised by the tobacco tax increases mandated by Proposition 99. The measure 
caused cigarette taxes to go up 25 cents a pack and resulted in comparable 
increases to other tobacco products, like cigars. The initiative directed that 
most of the money be used to finance health programs for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
County hospitals, emergency centers and health programs for the indigent will 
get the lion's share of the money. Los Angeles County government's share of the 
pie will amount to about $350 million over the 2 1/2-year life of the bill.

FRESNO NEWSPAPER ORDERED TO MAKE CHANGES IN VDTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the few government rulings in the nation requiring specific 
protection for workers who use video display terminals, Cal/OSHA has ordered 
the Fresno Bee to provide adjustable furniture, training and hourly breaks from 
typing to lessen the risk of repetitive-strain injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The state workplace safety agency said the newspaper -- whose reporters and 
copy editors have complained for two years of widespread health problems 
related to intense VDT use -- must begin making some of the changes as early as 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Bee executives said they plan to appeal the Cal/OSHA order because it 
duplicates planned equipment purchases and other measures already in effect. 
Representatives of the Northern California Newspaper Guild, whose complaint 
last spring led to the investigation, said they believe the paper would not 
have initiated those improvements as quickly without Cal/OSHA intervention. 
</P>
<P>
The state called for the changes in a "special order" made public late 
Wednesday after a final conference with newspaper officials. The order -- 
applicable only to the Bee -- was issued because the state has yet to develop 
regulations governing safe use of VDTs.

ASSEMBLY VOTE DETOURS PROPOSED L.A. TRUCK BAN

Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's efforts to impose fees on trucks using city 
streets suffered a setback Thursday as trucking interests won approval of a 
bill that would make it easier for them to challenge the fees in court. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring an impassioned plea from Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) 
to kill the measure, the Assembly voted 47-28 to pass legislation devised by 
trucking interests to stop local governments from restricting truck traffic and 
imposing local license fees. 
</P>
<P>
Although Los Angeles had been exempted from some provisions of the bill after 
Bradley made a rare appearance before an Assembly committee last month, 
trucking interests were able to reverse some of his gains on the Assembly 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment by Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville) said nothing in the 
bill could be construed as permission for cities or counties to levy new fees 
on trucks. Since current law is silent on the subject of local trucking fees, 
lawmakers said the amendment would pave the way for truckers to immediately 
challenge in court any fees imposed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his plan to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, Bradley has 
proposed to ban 70% of all trucks from city streets during rush hours and to 
require truckers to register with the city, pay a $60 annual fee and prove that 
their vehicles are in safe working order. 
</P>
<P>
Trucking interests, acknowledging that they wanted to torpedo Bradley's plan, 
won a promise from legislative leaders several weeks ago that they would push 
the trucking bill in return for the truckers' support of an $18.5-billion 
transportation plan considered by many lawmakers as a hallmark of this year's 
session. 
</P>
<P>
The transportation package, which cannot go into effect unless voters approve 
modifications in the state spending limit at a June, 1990, election, includes 
an increase of 9 cents per gallon in the state's gasoline tax and significant 
hikes in truck weight fees. 
</P>
<P>
"They (local governments) want to levy an individual fee on truckers," Baker 
said. "The truckers said 'no, if you do that we can't support additional fees 
at the state level.' " 
</P>
<P>
At Bradley's request, Los Angeles was exempted from the provisions in the 
trucking bill that limited local governments' ability to restrict truck 
traffic. Lawmakers also agreed to let cities impose local truck fees with the 
proviso that the fees could not remain in effect after Dec. 31, 1990, if voters 
approve the June ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
But with the latest amendment, lawmakers said, trucking interests would 
probably be able to use the courts to prevent any fees from going into effect. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), still must go back to 
the Senate for approval of the latest amendment.

<P>
The outlook for the remainder of the summer surface action is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
On the local scene, some barracuda and bonito at rocky point and the rigs are 
mixed together with yellowtail. Only the sand bass catches have slumped. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro and Long Beach sportfishing fleets on multiday trips have been 
chasing albacore and tuna, trolling 150 miles out with success. 
</P>
<P>
The Outerlimits from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing returned early Tuesday morning 
with 72 albacore, 46 skipjack and one dorado. 
</P>
<P>
The jackpot fish and one of the biggest dorado brought into a South Bay landing 
this year was caught by Barry Beh of Long Beach, who said the fish jumped out 
of the water several times and after 25 minutes was decked with help from the 
crew. It weighed in at 52 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Beh is having it stuffed for his trophy room. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Sportfishing's El Dorado multiday trip resulted in 175 albacore. Al 
Modefsoto of Inglewood caught the jackpot fish when he weighed in a yellowfin 
tuna at 57 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The King Harbor Marlin Club was the winner of the eighth annual Marlin 
Tournament, outpointing the Marina City Anglers. 
</P>
<P>
Both clubs caught a total of four marlin. The King Harbor club released more 
and earned the most points. 
</P>
<P>
John Whitaker of the King Harbor club was the top angler, with one marlin on 
12-pound test line brought to the boat in 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Top boat among the 27 competing was the Genesis, skippered by Robert Goldstein 
of the Marine City club. The Genesis took two fish, released one and weighed in 
one at Avalon at 181 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Vorgitch of Venice recently returned from Cabo San Lucas. While fishing 
aboard the Mad Dog, he boated the largest marlin caught at Cabo this season, a 
385-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
Freshwater Notes: 
</P>
<P>
John Peterson of Culver City, fishing Irvine Lake using marshmallows, reeled in 
a five-fish limit of catfish. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Dawson of Long Beach, fishing Irvine Lake, used mackerel for bait and 
reeled in a 10 1/2-pound catfish. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Tom McKindely of Redondo Beach, fishing at rocky point aboard the Redondo 
Special, caught the whopper of the week with a 31-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Powell of Carson, fishing at the rigs aboard the Victory using a jig with 
20-pound test line, pulled a yellowtail from the platform. It weighed 28 1/4 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Alan McFetridge of Torrance, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Blackjack, 
won the jackpot with a 26-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Lucas of Hermosa Beach, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at the rigs, 
caught a 21-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Amechin of Westchester, fishing aboard the Sportking at Rocky Point, 
caught a 16-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>

COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: LOYOLA'S VETERAN HARRIERS WILL HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH 
'YOUNG LIONS' THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alan Drooz 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When first-year Loyola Marymount cross-country Coach Mike Sheehan talks about 
his "young lions," he's doing more than making a play on words on the school 
nickname. 
</P>
<P>
He's issuing a challenge to the six veterans on his 11-man team. "The young 
kids are kind of making the elder statesmen take notice," Sheehan said after an 
impressive season opener Saturday. "The young Lions are gonna put us on top. 
The older guys, I've put it to 'em: I'm taking my top seven (to major meets)." 
</P>
<P>
The men's team opened with a home victory in an 8-kilometer race in 
Westchester, soundly defeating the University of San Diego, a conference rival, 
and a partial team from Santa Clara. Loyola had 21 points to San Diego's 34. 
</P>
<P>
A thinner Loyola women's team placed second among four schools on a 5-K course, 
also around Loyola's campus. The San Diego women won with 20 points, followed 
by Loyola (52), Mt. St. Mary's (64) and a partial Santa Clara team. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara's Dan Fisher won the men's race in 26 minutes, 40 seconds. But the 
Lions' top three ran in a cluster to place 2-3-4. The big surprise was freshman 
Mike Thom, who ran second in 27:29. Sophomore Eric Merk (27:41) and freshman 
Kevin Delaney (27:47) were close behind. Another sophomore, Dan Martinez, was 
10th (29:11), and junior Mike Roach was 11th (29:40). 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a couple of young guys who are really gonna do it, especially Mike 
Thom," Sheehan said. "He's done three marathons and a triathlon. He's looking 
very good. Merk was a surprise. He didn't look that impressive in workouts. But 
on meet day -- he's a racer. Delaney was his high school (Pasadena) mile, 
two-mile and cross-country champ. They ran well together, and ran well as a 
pack." 
</P>
<P>
There's more good news on the horizon for the men: Junior Mike Rauner, one of 
the team's top two runners last year, was sick in August and is still regaining 
his stamina but is nearly ready to return to competition. And Mark Malone, who 
was Loyola's No. 1 runner a few years ago, is enrolled again at Loyola after 
attending Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
It's a competitive situation, thanks to Sheehan, an enthusiastic 27-year-old 
whose first task was to set up a sign-up booth during orientation week to seek 
out runners. Loyola doesn't offer any cross-country scholarships. "We set up 
next to the cycling club, figuring we'd attract some biathletes and 
triathletes," he said. "We looked for people who looked like runners." The 
effort was a success, with three dozen people trying out. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan's first-year goal is to place second in the West Coast Conference 
behind perennial power Portland, which gives several scholarships. He'll get a 
look at Santa Clara's full team as well as Pepperdine's this weekend at a meet 
in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
The goals for the women aren't quite as ambitious yet. Sheehan found he was 
competing with the successful crew program for walk-on athletes, and he has 
only two returners on his eight-woman roster. Still, sophomore Jackie Creedon 
managed to finish third Saturday -- San Diego placed 1-2-4 -- and Sheehan has 
high hopes for her. "I hope we can take at least her to the regionals, and a 
full men's squad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Sheehan isn't just giving the team pep talks and standing on the 
sideline with a stopwatch. An avid competitive runner and marathoner, Sheehan 
is in training for next month's Athletics Congress nationals, and the San Diego 
International Marathon in December. Sheehan runs with both the men's and 
women's teams when they do speed work, and alternates distance workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to cater to both. I don't expect them to do anything I can't," he said. 
"It's a team effort from the coaches on down. I'm in training, so this is 
helping me. I'm not gonna let these young guys beat me." 
</P>
<P>
He's Ba-a-a-ack: Former San Pedro High and Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball 
player Victor (Vico) Nomaaea has returned to the Southland after serving a 
two-year Mormon mission in Samoa. But Nomaaea, who just got home last weekend, 
said he will probably not return to college before next semester -- if at all 
-- and may not play basketball if he does. 
</P>
<P>
And it may not be at Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Nomaaea, a guard who was the Toros' top three-point shooter in the 1986-87 
season, hasn't played organized ball in more than two years. He said he planned 
to drop by Dominguez Hills this week, then drive up to Brigham Young University 
in Utah to look around. He took several weeks of missionary training in Provo 
before he went to Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
Toros Coach Dave Yanai's attitude has been that if Nomaaea goes back to school 
and shows up for the team, he's welcome, but nobody is counting on him. Chances 
are, if he re-enrolls he won't play ball this school year. 
</P>
<P>
With All-American forward Billy Thompson out for several weeks because of 
injury, the UCLA soccer team has had to look elsewhere for offense, and has 
found some in defender Dana Keir. 
</P>
<P>
The junior from South Torrance High, shifted to forward as a fill-in, scored 
three goals in a 7-0 victory over UC Irvine on Sunday, surpassing his career 
total of two coming into the season. He leads the undefeated Bruins with four 
goals. His hat trick Sunday came after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid said of Keir, "The same attributes he has as a defender 
-- being good in the air, his aggressiveness and his strength -- make him a 
good forward. He's our power forward." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's fourth-ranked soccer team, hoping to increase its attendance with some 
night games, is playing a handful of evening contests using Murdock Stadium at 
El Camino College as its post-sundown home field. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who beat the University of San Diego there Tuesday, 2-0, to improve 
to 5-0, will entertain UC San Diego on Sept. 26, UC Berkeley on Oct. 6 and 
Wisconsin-Green Bay on Oct. 20 as part of a double header, after San Diego 
State vs. Rutgers. All the UCLA games begin at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have a strong South Bay influence, starting with Keir and Schmid, a 
Torrance resident and former coach at Bishop Montgomery High. Regulars include 
junior Ray Fernandez of Torrance at forward and senior Chris Roosen at 
midfield. Transfer Mark Sharp -- out of Rolling Hills by way of El Camino -- is 
expected to see considerable time at forward. The roster also includes freshman 
defender Matt Arnett from Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: Paul Krumpe, former UCLA soccer star and a member of the U.S. 
national team, is serving as an assistant to Dominguez Hills soccer Coach 
Marine Cano. The Torrance resident, a starting fullback on the U.S. team, is 
sitting out with an injury, and volunteered when he heard about Cano's need for 
coaching help. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Hueth, a West Torrance High graduate, is a returning starter for the 
Pepperdine volleyball team, which is defending its West Coast Conference title. 
The 5-11 sophomore earned all-freshman honors as an outside hitter. After five 
matches she's fifth on the Waves with 37 kills and second with 69 digs. Kevin 
Gilmore has been named sports information director at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. He has been assistant sports publicist at Cal Poly Pomona for two years. 
Pepperdine basketball Coach Tom Asbury and women's tennis Coach Gualberto 
Escudero were named the school's co-coaches of the year for the 1988-89 season.

THE BIG GAME; 
</P>
<P>
MT. CARMEL IN RANGE MORE THAN MOST WITH ABARE KICKING

<P>
The football field at Mt. Carmel High will seem considerably shorter tonight 
for the home team than it will be for visiting San Pasqual. 
</P>
<P>
An illusion? Tricky ground crew work? 
</P>
<P>
No, it a phenomenon even San Pasqual Coach Mike Dolan is aware of but can't do 
anything about. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel will be at a distinct advantage every time they cross the San 
Pasqual 35 simply because of the right leg of senior Pat Abare. 
</P>
<P>
In Mt. Carmel's 33-7 victory over Escondido last week, Abare kicked field goals 
of 47, 25, 30 and 34 yards without a miss. Both the 47-yarder and the four 
field goals in a game are school records. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual, on the other hand, is still looking for its first extra point of 
the season. After its first attempt failed to reach the line of scrimmage, San 
Pasqual decided not to risk any more embarrassment and ran for the next three 
conversions in a 28-21 victory over Poway. 
</P>
<P>
"We kicked the tee farther than the ball on the extra point," Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
In all fairness, San Pasqual was without regular kicker Roger Hill, out with a 
muscle pull. Hill, who also plays fullback, should return tonight, but Dolan 
realizes he is still giving up quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"(Abare) kicks 50-yarders like he was going out for a Sunday brunch," Dolan 
said. "That changes your offensive philosophy when you cross the fifty. That's 
usually no-man's land." 
</P>
<P>
Even his own coaches were shocked by Abare's 47-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
"My special teams coach looked at me when I said 'Let's go for the field goal' 
and asked me, "Do you know where we are?' " Mt. Carmel Coach Bill Christopher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Abare is a transfer from Mira Mesa. Christopher knew little about him before he 
walked into camp this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We played them last year, and I didn't have anything down about him in the 
scouting report," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
It's not likely he will be omitted from too many scouting reports this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a kicker that works like he does," Christopher said. "He has 
lifted weights as much as everyone else, and he went to kicking camp every 
summer to improve himself." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher also has sophomore halfback Tony Eannuci, who had 133 total yards 
and two touchdowns last week, and fullback Jeff Scott, who ran for 112 yards in 
22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Mt. Carmel ever sees the ball tonight is another story. Last week, San 
Pasqual ran 60 plays to Poway's 33. 
</P>
<P>
Senior tackle Lee Johnston (6-1, 262) anchors San Pasqual's large offensive 
line, which opens holes for junior fullback Cullen Owen (23 rushes, 91 yards 
last week) and senior halfback Andy Bacon (18-126). Option quarterback Jon 
Ramirez added 40 yards in 12 rushes and threw for 49 yards on four completions 
in four attempts.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SDSU SELLS FEWER TICKETS FOR FOOTBALL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego State has announced that football season ticket sales for the 1989 
season were down 19.8% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs sold 12,154 season tickets for the seven-game home schedule that 
opens Saturday night against UCLA at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Last year, 
the Aztecs sold 15,148 for a five-game home schedule. Both figures include 
sales of discounted student season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue from season tickets was reported at $612,167, up slightly from last 
year's $595,765 because of a price increase with the two extra home games. 
</P>
<P>
But the figure is about $106,000 below the athletic department's budgeted 
figure for football season ticket revenue. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU has lost its second basketball recruit to academic difficulties. Steve 
McClellan, a 6-foot-6 forward from Arizona Western College in Yuma, has been 
denied admission, said John Rosenthal, sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
McClellan, who attended Fresno Edison High School, averaged 11 points and nine 
rebounds last year as sophomore at Arizona Western. Earlier, the Aztecs lost 
guard Ray Barefield, a 6-1 guard from Fresno Hoover, when he failed to meet 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. freshman eligibility requirements. 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dodd and Tim Hovland will try to make it a clean sweep with their third 
victory in the $100,000 Jose Cuervo Gold Crown today and Saturday at Mariner's 
Point in Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd, who played basketball and volleyball at San Diego State, and Hovland have 
already won the first two tournaments of the triple crown of beach volleyball, 
at Boulder, Colo., and Clearwater, Fla. The tournaments are each worth $50,000 
to the winning team. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging Dodd and Hovland will be Sinjin Smith, the all-time leading money 
winner, and Randy Stoklos, the tour's most valuable player last season. Smith 
and Stoklos have won more tournaments than any team in the sport's history.

MAJORITY HOLDER OF YUBA IS SELLING TO DENVER FIRM 
</P>

<P>
Bond International Gold of Denver is selling its two-thirds interest in the 
Yuba Goldfields mining operation near Marysville to WestGold of Denver, for $16 
million and a royalty interest in the mine, the companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
One-third owner in the mining operation called Yuba Placer Gold is Yuba Natural 
Resources, a San Diego-based company whose former chairman, Richard Silberman, 
was arrested and indicted earlier this year on money-laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
Before his arrest in April, Silberman was a power in statewide Democratic 
politics and held a Cabinet post in then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s 
administration. His trial is scheduled to begin early next year in U. S. 
District Court in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Yuba spokesman Marshall Mintz said the purchase by WestGold is a "positive 
event" but declined to comment further on the partnership's plans for the mine. 
</P>
<P>
The mine east of Marysville involves a giant dredge that digs ore from a river 
bed at depths of 100 feet or more and which refines the ore into ingots. The 
9,000 acres of land on which the mine is situated is owned by Yuba Natural 
Resources, which assigned mining rights to Yuba Placer Gold in exchange for a 
one-third interest. 
</P>
<P>
WestGold, short for Western Gold Exploration &amp; Mining Co. Ltd., is a 
partnership of Inspiration Resources, a publicly traded natural-resources 
mining company based in New York, and Minorco of Luxembourg. WestGold's 
properties include a mining project in Nome, Alaska, that accounted for about 
half the 67,000 ounces of gold that WestGold produced last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improvement Predicted 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Yuba Placer Gold extracted about 22,000 ounces of gold from the 
Marysville mine. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Foote, vice president of Bond International Gold, said Thursday that 
his company invested $3 million in improving the dredge, which will result in a 
"significant" increase in gold production this year. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bond is selling its interest in the Yuba mine because the mine 
did not fit in with its "general strategy of expanding our underground and 
open-pit operations," Foote said. 
</P>
<P>
The five other mines Bond operates, in North and South America, are either 
open-pit or underground. It also has interests in several mines in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Bond International Gold is a publicly traded company controlled by Australian 
investor Alan Bond.

SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ABOUT THE EAMES HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remembering the agreeable afternoon spent with Leon Whiteson at the Eames House 
and reading the opening paragraphs of his article about it, I couldn't imagine 
where the misleading headline "New Life for Landmark Fixer-Upper" came from 
(Aug. 14). "New Life" disagreeably and falsely implies that earlier the house 
had been dead, whereas actually we celebrate the life with which Charles and 
Ray Eames infused the house from the start. From its construction, they 
maintained it beautifully. A landmark it certainly is, and treasured by our 
family. It is deserving of the work that we in our turn have done to keep it in 
mint condition, but the term "fixer-upper" has never been remotely appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Appreciating the genuine interest and positive support shown by Whiteson, I am 
moved to clarify a few points in the article: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The words "rundown" (house) and "overgrown" (grounds) have never been 
applicable. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The house is not open to visitors or tours. In the future, we hope that we 
might be able to permit visitors by appointment, but even then just the 
exterior would be open. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While Ray dressed beautifully and with a most elegant sense of color and 
texture, she was not "always dressed to match the current interior design." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The molded plastic chair that came out of an experiment with limb splints 
. . . " sentence is confusing and inaccurate. The fact is that the molded 
fiberglass chair came after the molded plywood chair that had won the Museum of 
Modern Art Furniture competition and was established as a "classic of 
contemporary design" long before Herman Miller marketed it. Furthermore, during 
WW II, Charles' and Ray's work on techniques for molding plywood was applied to 
making limb splints for wounded servicemen as well as a proposed stretcher and 
plywood glider nose cone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Eameses designed for film director Billy Wilder the chaise lounge that 
later went into production, not the lounge chair and the ottoman. Wilder will 
attest to the peculiar resilience of that myth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Charles and Ray Eames scholarship fund has been established at Cranbrook 
Academy of Art which is in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, not Bloomington, Ill. 
Charles was a design instructor at Cranbrook, not a student, when they met. Ray 
did not simply "want to be a painter" -- she had studied with Hans Hoffman in 
New York for several years and Ray was a painter. 
</P>
<P>
I appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight. I also want to thank 
The Times and Leon Whiteson in particular for their kind interest and concern 
for the Eames House as a landmark of international importance.

CHOLESTEROL MYTH MAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your Sept. 7 piece about the Atlantic's article on "The Cholesterol 
Myth" (by Garry Abrams), Thomas Moore is not alone in challenging popular 
thinking. On March 28, a maverick scientist from New Zealand also made waves in 
the tranquil waters of Los Angeles cardiology circles. He lectured to a group 
of eminent heart specialists at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on "Atherosclerosis 
and the Cholesterol Myth." Atherosclerosis is the more correct term for what is 
commonly known as arteriosclerosis or "hardening of the arteries." 
</P>
<P>
The speaker, William E. Stehbens, is a professor of pathology at the University 
of Otago in Wellington, New Zealand. He is no novice in the cardiac research 
field and is dedicated to finding the true cause of atherosclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
He contends with much supporting evidence that there is no scientific basis for 
assuming that a diet that will lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) 
and that raises high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) can favorably alter 
the process of atherosclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
One of the sharpest arrows in his quiver is directed at the evidence used to 
evaluate the effects of heart disease therapy. It has long been known that 
statistics obtained from death certificate records are so notoriously 
inaccurate as to be meaningless. A humorous but macabre example is the 
exceptionally high incidence of brain hemorrhage recorded as the cause of death 
in Japan. Because of a cultural quirk, death from brain hemorrhage connotes a 
person of considerable intellect, while to die of heart disease implies a 
mundane existence. The resultant lopsided statistical picture is meaningless 
scientifically. 
</P>
<P>
Stehbens takes on with a vengeance those scientists who indicate that the lipid 
hypothesis has already been proven. He is especially incensed at the 
unchallenging way in which this has been accepted not only by newspapers, 
television and radio, but by scientific journals as well. 
</P>
<P>
Other imaginative scientists are currently investigating ways of directly 
affecting the atherosclerosis changes responsible for heart disease other than 
by changing the blood cholesterol level. These do hold out hope for concrete 
methods of preventing coronary artery disease.

SOUTH AFRICAN PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "A Marketplace of African Authenticity" (by Sheldon Teitelbaum, Aug. 
19): 
</P>
<P>
I was dismayed by his reference to Southern California's "thriving white South 
African community" who, for "obvious political reasons, have not been asked to 
attend." 
</P>
<P>
As a fourth-generation white South African who felt compelled to leave South 
Africa for "obvious political reasons," I was deeply saddened by the inference 
that all white South Africans are collectively and irrevocably guilty and 
therefore unworthy of sharing in African pride and the celebration of African 
culture. It is like suggesting that all Ugandans must share the blame for the 
atrocities and excesses of Idi Amin. If we are to identify all human beings 
with their rulers there will not be any hope for any of us. 
</P>
<P>
Many white Africans live in the United States in self-imposed exile, away from 
our families and yearning for our roots just as strongly as black Africans do. 
I left South Africa because it is a country where "assumptions" (to put it 
euphemistically) are made on the basis of skin color alone. Will it be the same 
in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
I hope an effort will be made to reach out to and include white South Africans 
in the African Marketplace. Believe me, having a white skin does not make me 
feel any more American, nor, indeed, any less African.

SEEING RED OVER EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading "For Asians in U.S., a New Focus On Eye Surgery" (by Irene Chang, 
Aug. 22), I was shocked that UCLA is promoting courses on this trivial surgery. 
UCLA is a publicly supported institution and I am incensed that my state tax 
money is being spent on this training. 
</P>
<P>
The entire plastic surgery industry has gotten out of line. Physicians trained 
at taxpayer expense are taking advantage of people's insecurities to fatten 
their own wallets. They would do better using their skills to treat real 
illnesses instead of encouraging this needless mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
Asians, with or without rounder eyes, will still remain Asians; Italian women 
do not look like Swedes and a Swedish nose just looks ridiculous on an Italian. 
Not only are some of these women denying their heritage, but they make 
themselves look laughable. 
</P>
<P>
Again, they have a willing partner in this procedure: the unethical and 
money-hungry physician.

Talk show host/singer Dinah Shore landed a "scoop" while taping an interview 
with "Jeopardy!" host Alex Trebek this week. When Shore remarked that Trebek 
was one of TV's most eligible bachelors, he broke the news that "I am going to 
be married ... and this is the first time I've said it out loud." His intended 
is Jean Currivan, a commercial real-estate agent in Los Angeles. Trebek's 
office confirmed Thursday that a wedding is planned, but said no date has been 
set. Shore was taping the show here for later airing on "A Conversation With 
Dinah," her new series on TNN cable. ALEENE MacMINN

The first five winners of a new Japanese-sponsored arts prize called the 
Praemium Imperiale will be announced today in New York, recognizing lifetime 
achievement in architecture, music, painting, sculpture and theater/film. The 
recipients, who will receive $100,000 each, are recommended by an International 
Committee of Advisers composed of three former European prime ministers 
(Jacques Chirac of France, Edward Heath of Britain and Amintore Fanfani of 
Italy), one former West German chancellor (Helmut Schmidt) and David 
Rockefeller, former chairman and chief executive officer of Chase Manhattan 
Bank. Praemium Imperiale organizers expect their creation to become the 
equivalent of the Nobel Prize, which does not recognize artistic fields other 
than literature. ALEENE MacMINN

Actor Rob Lowe, fulfilling his court-ordered community service, has been 
speaking this week to inmates at detention and rehabilitation centers in his 
hometown of Dayton, Ohio. He also took a side trip to visit former baseball 
manager Pete Rose, and helped his father, attorney Chuck Lowe, celebrate his 
50th birthday. The visit is the first Lowe has made to his hometown since he 
was accused of shooting a sexually explicit videotape involving a teen-age girl 
during the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. A Georgia court 
sentenced him to 20 hours of community service, which he agreed to do to avoid 
possible criminal action. He remains the subject of a federal lawsuit by the 
girl's mother who contends that Lowe, 25, seduced her underage daughter. ALEENE

OPERA REVIEW;

<P>
A 'FALSTAFF' REVIVAL WITH COMPROMISES IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some operas virtually play themselves. Give "La Boheme" or "La Traviata" even 
the most base of basic goods, and it is hard to fail. 
</P>
<P>
Other operas are more delicate. They require special, loving, enlightened care. 
One can't just stir and serve Verdi's "Falstaff," for instance. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, the San Francisco Opera tried to do just that. The management 
called up some pretty sets from the warehouse, dusted off the motley costumes 
and assembled an almost-reasonable cast. So far so mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody did anything bad. But hardly anyone did anything good enough. 
</P>
<P>
The troubles began at the top. Verdi's miraculously witty, complex and poignant 
valedictory requires a great conductor, a brilliant director and a formidable 
singing-actor in the title role. Terence McEwen, who selected the personnel for 
this endeavor before handing over the company to Lotfi Mansouri, settled for 
compromises. 
</P>
<P>
To represent the composer in the pit, McEwen turned to Kazimierz Kord. He is a 
fine musician, a solid technician, a thoughtful stylist in the right challenge. 
"Falstaff," unfortunately, demands a Toscanini, a Bernstein or a Giulini. 
</P>
<P>
Kord kept things moving decently, if a bit ponderously. He got the orchestra to 
play well, and he accompanied the singers deftly. Ultimately, he gave us prose 
when we needed poetry. 
</P>
<P>
The production was originally staged and designed in 1985 by Jean-Pierre 
Ponnelle. As such, it was a fussy enlargement of a pictorial scheme first 
envisioned for the tiny stage in Glyndebourne in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme -- cold, contrived and cutesy -- wasn't particularly effective then. 
It really looks drab and mechanical now. 
</P>
<P>
Since Ponnelle's untimely death in the summer of 1988, his productions have 
been entrusted to ex-assistants, who assume the unhappy, inflexible task of 
enforcing old laws even where they no longer make sense. In this instance, Vera 
Lucia Calabria held the book and functioned as faithful traffic cop. 
</P>
<P>
She can't be blamed for the general absence of spontaneity. Even if she wanted 
to, she probably could not have refocused the action (a cackling page boy dares 
interrupt "Quand'ero paggio") or elevate the taste (a sloppy servant actually 
splashes the contents of two chamber-pots all over Mistress Ford's living 
room). 
</P>
<P>
Some of Verdi's -- or Shakespeare's -- spark still might have been salvaged by 
a persuasive protagonist. No such luck. 
</P>
<P>
As the fat knight, Thomas Stewart is neither fat nor knightly. He is tall and 
imposing (several Don Giovannis within memory boasted bigger paunches). One 
cannot fathom why he waddles. He is also crusty and amiable, but never very 
funny, never much of an amorous or social threat, never an eloquent exponent of 
dignity in decay. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage in his distinguished career, moreover, Stewart tends to merely 
approximate the vocal line. He never did command a big, juicy Verdi baritone 
(Wagner was his mezzo-forte). Now, at 63, his resources force him to meet most 
legato challenges with parlando evasions. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the merry wives turned out to be holdovers from Ponnelle's original 
cast. Pilar Lorengar returned bright and matronly as Alice Ford. Marilyn Horne 
-- much slenderized in body, somewhat slenderized in voice -- mustered a 
restrained Mistress Quickly. That must be an oxymoron. Ruth Ann Swenson again 
floated rapturous pianissimo tones in the love music of Nannetta. 
</P>
<P>
Best among the newcomers in the ensemble was Michel Senechal, a sweetly 
crotchety Caius. Kathryn Cowdrick held her own spunkily as Meg Page, a role she 
had undertaken in the student-matinees three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
John David De Haan suggested the boyish ardor of Fenton agreeably, though his 
lyric tenor tended to evaporate in the wide open spaces. J. Patrick Raftery's 
recently resplendent baritone betrayed alarming signs of decline in the gutsy 
music of Ford. Joseph Frank and David Pittsinger contributed dull caricatures 
as Bardolfo and Pistola. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Ponnelle vetoed the distracting crutch of supertitles. This time, 
however, the translated lines were flashed across the proscenium, inspiring the 
non-capacity audience to laugh before the funny lines were uttered. 
</P>
<P>
All the world's a jest, indeed.

PACINO AND BARKIN MAKE A BIG SPLASH IN 'SEA OF LOVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Sea of Love" (citywide) is a satisfactory end-of-summer diversion, the kind of 
film that works as long as you ask nothing of it beyond simple escape. It's a 
slick, knowing genre film, through and through, a New York cop suspense 
thriller that we've seen countless times before. 
</P>
<P>
It does, thankfully, have a sense of humor, and it does have Al Pacino, Ellen 
Barkin and John Goodman, all of whom are a bright, constant pleasure. Pacino 
and Barkin do scorch the screen, although this doesn't happen until a full hour 
into the picture; nevertheless, they become helpful in distracting attention 
from various implausibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Richard Price and director Harold Becker take more time and pains than 
necessary to establish that Pacino's Frank Keller, a Manhattan police detective 
unsettled by reaching 20 years on the force, is a savvy, dedicated pro, earthy, 
gregarious and volatile yet an achingly lonely man beneath all the bravado. 
Goodman's sharp, humorous Sherman, a detective in Queens, comes into the 
picture when he and Frank team up to try to catch a serial killer whose victims 
are selected in the personals column of a singles magazine. Their one break 
appears to be that the murderer is attracted to ads employing poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Barkin's Helen, the cool, sexy manager of a chic shoe store, is one of the 
respondents to an ad placed by Frank as a bait. After a bit of skirmishing, 
Frank and Helen commence a highly combustible romance. Never mind that this is 
contrary to orders; Frank is so carried away that he even resists having 
Helen's water glass checked for prints. Yet a series of incidents and remarks 
suggest that Frank's life could very well be in great danger. Golly, Helen even 
has a copy of Phil Phillips' "Sea of Love" in her collection of old 45s, a 
record that was playing over and over at the scene of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
On its most basic level, "Sea of Love" works because Barkin has the skill to 
keep us guessing whether she is actually a man-hating crazy or just a wary 
veteran of the dating wars. There's no question that we are meant to see writ 
in large the paranoia that cripples so many relationships out there in the 
urban jungle, but this is to take "Sea of Love" too seriously. (Actually, the 
film is preferable to the disturbingly muddled seriousness of "Fatal 
Attraction.") 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing at all profound in Helen or Frank, and Pacino and Barkin are 
engaged in showy star turns, loaded with attitudes and poses, that are fun in 
themselves and in fact appropriate for this superficial entertainment. Their 
duel of personalities is nicely anchored by the presence of Goodman, whose wit 
is as formidable as his bulk. Patricia Barry is heart-breaking as an elegant, 
lonely older woman who has answered Frank's ad. 
</P>
<P>
As sleek as "Sea of Love" (rated R for violence, sex and language) is, it can't 
quite keep us away from wondering how a smart woman like Helen, whose looks 
would stop traffic and whose work would bring her into constant contact with an 
array of sophisticated men, would ever resort to the personals -- unless, of 
course, she really is a psychopath.

WRITER-DIRECTOR FAILS TO SEE OR SELL 'THE BIG PICTURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Big Picture" (selected theaters) is an attempted satire on the banalities 
and venalities of Hollywood that turns into a kind of celebrity roast. Somehow, 
the jokesters and their target get promiscuously intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
This is supposedly a movie about idealistic film makers trapped in the 
Hollywood system. Yet it looks like a standard '80s sell-out comedy, full of 
lame dialogue, guest stars and shticky gags, with a young hero seduced away 
from his steadfast girlfriend by the daffy, goofy, corrupt Establishment -- and 
then finding himself, and integrity, in time for the rock song under the 
closing credits. 
</P>
<P>
This attack on compromise -- in which Nick Chapman (Kevin Bacon), a 
student-film prize winner, is wooed and dumped by the dream factory -- looks 
like all the other rib-digging sex-and-success comedies: the end result of the 
same marketing-research, cookie-cutter methods it's trying to spoof. It's as if 
a film maker wanted to make a satire about a young genius trying to make 
another "Persona" inside the Hollywood system, and being forced to turn it into 
"Beach Blanket Bingo" -- and then somebody decided to play it safe by sticking 
in sex and beaches and shooting it in the style of "National Lampoon's 
Vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Writer-director Christopher Guest blows his wad early. He and his hip 
cinematographer, Jeff Jur ("Dirty Dancing"), stage a student film awards 
banquet with four amusing parodies of typical student films. This scene, emceed 
by Eddie Albert, is clever but no gem. And, if it weren't for later appearances 
by Martin Short (unbilled) as an effete agent and J. T. Walsh and Don Franklin 
as a bland exec and his crafty secretary, it would be the best the movie has to 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
"The Big Picture" has the same flaws as most student films. It's underwritten 
and overdirected. The laborious, one-note gags include old movie parodies of 
Bogart, "Psycho" and "The Lost Weekend," opulent parties with starlets who 
ditch you when you're down, funny fat snobs, rock videos and swishy agents. 
Guest, who has wonderful delayed comic timing when he acts, delays the timing 
too much here: The whole picture seems sapped. 
</P>
<P>
Scriptwriters Guest and Michael McKean ("This Is Spinal Tap") and Michael 
Varhol ("Pee-wee's Big Adventure") have amusing credits; McKean also doubles as 
a lovable buddy cinematographer. But their dialogue here has the monomaniacally 
spare quality of the average '80s studio screenplay, as if the speeches were 
being held under seven to 10 words apiece to keep readers from eye-strain. The 
few observant bits of Hollywood jargon ("Call my secretary and I'll call you 
back") rattle around like manufactured bon mots in a sea of tinseled blather. 
</P>
<P>
Guest's heart is in the right place. But "The Big Picture" (MPAA-rated PG-13) 
is closer to a jiggle movie than to a truly trenchant Hollywood satire like 
Preston Sturges' "Sullivan's Travels" or Ben Hecht's "Woman of Sin." And, as 
for the brilliant personal drama that Chapman wants to shoot: It looks pretty 
terrible, too -- as if Nick were trying to remake "The Passion of Anna" on a 
set built for a Frosty the Snowman commercial. If you're going to mock 
commercialism and stand up for art, you'd better make sure you know the 
difference between them.

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: PAINTINGS, TEXT SPEAK OF THE 'TRAUMA' IN 
CHINA'S BODY POLITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
The body politic is not just a figure of speech but a metaphor as old as the 
oldest cave clan. In a striking series of wall paintings and texts at Sushi 
(852 8th Ave.), Hung Liu brings the metaphor up to date by applying it to the 
present situation in China. The country, she asserts, is ill. A living, organic 
entity, it has lost its sense of balance and stumbled into a state of disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Trauma," the name of Liu's show, contains few concrete references to the 
violent suppression of student demonstrators in Tian an Men Square last June. 
Liu, a Chinese artist who attended UC San Diego and now teaches art in Texas, 
doesn't spell out her opposition to the government's actions in literal terms. 
She avoids particularities and instead presents a philosophical framework in 
which to interpret these recent events. The scheme she offers derives from 
Taoist philosophy and traditional Chinese medicine: the concept of yin and 
yang. 
</P>
<P>
"The balance between these two primordial cosmic forces is viewed as the key 
factor in all natural phenomena and life processes," she writes on one wall. 
Yin and yang depend on one another; their balance signifies health and 
well-being for the individual and society alike. 
</P>
<P>
Liu further explains in her wall text that these forces are not static. 
Everything is relative, flexible, changing. Both yin and yang "contain the germ 
of their own opposite within themselves," and when one pushes the limits of its 
own definition too far, it "transmutes" into the other. Thus the 
revolutionaries of one generation become another's stolid bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
Liu erects this conceptual scaffolding with deft and dramatic brush strokes, 
painted directly on the gallery walls. The immediacy of her approach and her 
stark palette of red, white and black lend the imagery an engaging clarity, but 
more is needed -- perhaps an explanatory text apart from the paintings -- to 
give the non-Chinese viewer access to the work's symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
Looming figures of a rat and rabbit, for instance, guard the entrance to the 
show. Familiar players in the zodiac cosmology, the animals also are believed 
to guard against sickness and bad fortune. Less apparent, though highly 
significant to their context here and explained privately by the artist, is the 
animals' guardianship over certain hours of the day. By presenting the rat, 
guardian of late night hours, with the rabbit, protector of the early morning, 
Liu has framed the span of time during which the massacres occurred in Tian An 
Men Square -- the span, she explained, during which no protection was provided. 
</P>
<P>
Amid Chinese and English texts on another wall, Liu repeats an image of three 
hands in slightly varied formations. Though this, too, is not clear simply on 
sight, these diagram the preferred methods of taking one's pulse, in Chinese 
medicine the primary indicator of physiological distress. 
</P>
<P>
Other paintings in the installation convey the metaphor linking the body and 
the state more explicitly through the layering of distinct but conceptually 
related images. A map of central Beijing overlaps an illustration of a man, 
seen from the front and back, with his acupuncture points marked and labeled. 
Liu here draws a vivid parallel between the body's centers of energy and the 
city's, both sites of trauma when the system malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
In a facing image, symbols of liberty flicker lithely around a painting of a 
woman with bound feet. The woman stares numbly ahead, her ritualistic 
repression finding its release in the expansive gestures of the Statue of 
Liberty and the allegorical image of "Liberty Leading the People" from the 
painting of the same name by Eugene Delacroix. Both the American and the French 
symbols served as inspiration to the students demonstrating in China. 
</P>
<P>
Liu weaves an intelligent and provocative web of words and images in "Trauma," 
punctuating the paintings with wood cutouts of a figure practicing Tai Chi, 
striving for the balance, grace and stability aspired to equally by individuals 
and nations. 
</P>
<P>
A gentleness and even a sadness pervade the installation, where one would 
expect to find angry indictments. The installation thus takes one of the 
richest tacks that politically oriented art can take. By casting a familiar 
subject in a radically new guise, it invites new and differing interpretations. 
Neither prescriptive nor propagandistic, Liu's work envelops the viewer in 
fresh ideas and functions as a catalyst for further thought. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sushi's visual arts programming has often been ambitious, few artists 
have been able to unify and activate the gallery's awkward exhibition space as 
effectively as Hung Liu. Her show continues through Oct. 14.

MOVABLE FEASTS: ELITE'S FRESH UPDATE ON 'KOSHER GOURMET FOOD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.N. HALLIBURTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elite Cuisine of Hancock Park and West Los Angeles serves -- are you ready -- 
Kosher gourmet food. It would take a couple hundred pages of Talmudic 
discussion to evaluate that phrase, so I'll refrain. 
</P>
<P>
While I didn't find the ghost of Escoffier -- or the guiding presence of Alice 
Waters -- at Elite, neither did I find the sort of "gourmet" dishes I think of 
as "Haute de Cruise." 
</P>
<P>
What you get at Elite is simple food, made with eagle-eyed care (in accordance 
with Jewish dietary laws, dairy and meat products are not mixed and there is no 
shellfish or pork). The meals tend to be unadorned, made with far less oil than 
one generally finds, and very, very fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the familiar brisket, noodle pudding, stuffed cabbage, schnitzel and 
homemade gefilte fish garnered from Eastern European culture, Elite prepares 
Middle Eastern dishes, including several eggplant salads and chicken with 
apricots and oranges. After all, kosher cuisine appears in different guises 
throughout the world, reflecting the many places where Jews live. 
</P>
<P>
 You might think of stuffed cabbage and noodle pudding as being the weight of a 
handsome doorstop, but Elite's hand-rolled cabbage leaves filled with a juicy 
mixture of rice and ground beef are positively delicate. Both sweet noodle 
kugel (certainly no featherweight, festooned as it is with streusel and 
apricots) and pepperly potato kugel are also lighter than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Salads are available by the plate ($3.50 for one, $5.50 for two, $7.50 for 
three) or by the pound, and prices are extremely modest compared with many 
upscale take-out venues. There is a particularly alert potato salad ($2.95 per 
pound) made with chunky, firm onions. Cucumber salad ($2.95) is well-modulated 
and smooth; black bean salad, while not exciting, has a nice clean taste. And 
garbanzo salad is the real thing, not canned. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli salad, a combination of chopped cucumbers, tomatoes and parsley, is 
lively. Hatzilim ($7.95 per pound), the Israeli version of baba ghannouj, 
tahini and crushed roasted eggplant, is light, frothy and fabulous. Eggplant 
salad is also wonderful in brazen, seriously garlic way. 
</P>
<P>
I'd imagine that the snow pea and fresh corn salad ($7.95 per pound) is 
seasonal. It's crunchy and super sweet and doused with a beguiling dressing. 
But the rice salad with peanuts was pedestrian. As for the chicken salad, well, 
the walnuts, raisins and green onions were without reproach, but the poor 
chicken had been zealously pulverized into a paste. 
</P>
<P>
In the serious protein department, tender beefy ribs are a good bet, cloaked in 
a chaste tomato sauce. If meat loaf grew on trees, I'd say Elite's ($6.95 per 
pound), full of juicy sweet onions, tasted just picked. The baked salmon 
steaks, sturdy and $14.95 per pound, were overcooked. The chicken schnitzel 
($9.50 per pound), a large boneless, skinless breast, comes lightly breaded, 
lightly fried and rather unadorned. Baked chicken with apricots and oranges had 
a generous homemade taste. 
</P>
<P>
It all reminds me of an old ad campaign for Levy's Rye Bread: You don't have to 
know your brisket from your schnitzel, your milchig from your fleishig to 
recognize spankingly fresh food. 
</P>
<P>

through Thursday 11 a.m.-9 p.m., Friday 9 a.m.-3:30 p.m. Also at 9303 W. Pico

STAGE BEAT: 'WEEKEND' AT POWERHOUSE; ONE-ACTS AT THEATER OF NOTE; 'MEN DIE 
SOONER' AT CAST; 'PLAYROOM' AT RAPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
David and Doe have gathered the scattered remains of a far-flung flock to their 
home near Madison, Wis. It's a stormy weekend in 1979 and the low rumble of 
thunder echoes through Kathleen Tolan's "A Weekend Near Madison" at the 
Powerhouse Theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Madison" is bound by nostalgia to its roots in the late '60s. Its characters 
are testimony to failed dreams and compromise, and ache with being 
thirtysomething. 
</P>
<P>
Poor kids. 
</P>
<P>
Tolan's ideas are firm and her dialogue sings with honesty about her 
characters, but the play has the looseness of its period and its success in 
this production is due to its execution. 
</P>
<P>
Director Andy Fickman knows the sound and soul of the play, hears its resonance 
and the zig-zag rhythms of its dialogue. His cast is in on the game too, 
hitting each mark in the music with unerring accuracy. They know how to make an 
ordinary play extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Shaifer is intuitive in finding the soft spots in the character of 
David's brother Jim, an art gallery assistant who wants to recapture a lost 
romance but not at the price he is given. David's wife, Doe, is a network of 
hurt and hope in the performance of Jodi Kavanaugh. Joe Plewa as David and Jill 
Kiblinger as Jim's ex, now enraptured with her folk-singing partner Samantha, 
echo the loss of earlier fire. 
</P>
<P>
Where have all the flowers gone? To suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3116 2nd St., Santa Monica, Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., until Oct. 
19. Tickets: $15; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
'Palmdale', 'Arroyo Rep' 
</P>
<P>
The Theater of NOTE is back with two one-acts of varying quality and interest. 
</P>
<P>
The opener, "Palmdale," is a slice of life about goings-on in the high desert. 
It's as paper-thin as prosciutto. Cheryl Slean's play, directed forthrightly by 
Marianne Simon, concerns Acey, a young woman played by the playwright, who has 
learned to read palms and wants to move to the big hamlet to follow her dream. 
The stock characters include an honestly romantic Chad Einbinder as her 
boyfriend Eddie, a delightfully rambunctious Shannon Pingrin as her tomboy 
sister Iris, and a well-defined mother played by Debora Roventini. Philip 
Sokoloff looks only uncomfortable as the traveling sucker Juan, who gets his 
palm read by way of practice. 
</P>
<P>
More notable is the second half of the bill, Grubb Graebner's "Arroyo Repo." 
John Callahan and Doug Burch portray scroungy desert rats out to make a 
killing, in a play that's a Sam Shepard clone, saved by Bob Kip's vaudevillian 
direction and the wild and crazy performances of its two protagonists. 
</P>
<P>
They dredge up all sorts of detritus, including tires and a free-wheeling 
wench, from a dangerous ditch near their shack. They also find great dollops of 
humor and insight about the human condition. The play has little to say but 
chuckles a lot (the TV doesn't work but they watch it anyway), particularly in 
Burch's inventive performance as the incorrigible Rave. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1761 N. Vermont Ave., Wednesdays and Thursdays, 8 p.m., through Oct. 5. 
Tickets: $12.50; (213) 664-0689. 
</P>
<P>
'Men Die Sooner' 
</P>
<P>
Guys have a rough life. And statistics seem to back up the premise of Tom 
Cayler's one-man performance piece "Men Die Sooner" at the Cast Theater -- but 
why? 
</P>
<P>
Cayler and his co-writers Kay Cummings (who also directed) and Clarice Marshall 
(who staged Cayler's movement) have some explanations as they explore the life 
of a generic male from childhood to terminal panic. 
</P>
<P>
Their stance is Benchley-esque and the lecture Cayler delivers is as spare and 
satirical as "The Treasurer's Report." When he steps away from the lecturer as 
his own exhibit No. 1, to check his heartbeat, to jog, to force his subject 
into an escalating cacophony of movement, each gesture and pose is as 
meaningful as the pat words of the lecturer. 
</P>
<P>
It's a thin piece, and short, but that very thinness is its strength and the 
root of its humor. And the charts (by Pier Voulkos) that the lecturer uses to 
help visualize his points are as funny in their loony abstraction as is the 
lecturer himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Men don't cry," he says, on the way to heart attack and stroke ("Sauce 
Bernaise Syndrome"), but fortunately they can laugh at what fools these mortals 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 At 804 N. El Centro Ave., Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 8 p.m., through Oct. 4. 
Tickets: $12; (213) 462-0265. 
</P>
<P>
'The Playroom' 
</P>
<P>
Mary Drayton's odd little play about a discomfitted Manhattan teen-ager who 
decides to kidnap her new stepsister has a lot of promise, but the period 
writing makes it look like "The Bad Seed Meets Corliss Archer" and the B-movie 
dialogue and B-movie direction by Gregory Black defeat most of the actors. 
</P>
<P>
An attic room in New York's Montana apartments is the focal point in Judy's 
misfired attempt at getting attention. But it's the only focal point in Theater 
Rapport's misfired production of a mediocre play that doesn't even come within 
shouting distance of its possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Phoebe Farber as the nasty kid who starts it all, and Greg Safel as her 
conniving boyfriend almost make their plot believable. But the rest of the 
company unravels the loose threads of this dated fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1277 N. Wilton Place, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., through Oct. 13. 
Tickets: $14; (213) 285-8170.

'LAND BEFORE TIME' TARGETS THE GIFT MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The video Christmas season opens this weekend with the release of "The Land 
Before Time" (MCA, $24.95, G), the first of several blockbuster films aimed at 
the gift market. 
</P>
<P>
Since they're both being released on video this fall, the similarities between 
"The Land Before Time" and "Bambi" (coming Sept. 28) may become even more 
apparent. Like "Bambi," "The Land Before Time" is an animated film concerning a 
young animal who's forced to cope with separation from parents and a 
cataclysmic event. In "Land," it's a dinosaur instead of a deer and an 
earthquake instead of a forest fire. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Don Bluth ("An American Tail"), "The Land Before Time" earned mixed 
but generally approving reviews, and the 1988 release -- produced by George 
Lucas and Steven Spielberg -- made nearly $50 million at the box office. The 
tape has a pizza-company ad. 
</P>
<P>
Other upcoming videocassettes that will compete with "Land" and "Bambi" for the 
video fan's rental/purchase dollars: "Lean on Me" (Sept. 27), "Working Girl," 
"Major League," "The Dream Team" (all three Oct. 5), "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," 
"Pet Sematary" (Oct. 12), "Lawrence of Arabia" (Oct. 19), "Scrooged" (Nov. 9), 
"Batman" (Nov. 15) and "Ghostbusters II" (Nov. 22). 
</P>
<P>
Other movies out this week on video: 
</P>
<P>
"Fletch Lives" (MCA, $89.95, PG), the sequel to "Fletch," again starring Chevy 
Chase as the wise-cracking reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"Cousins" (Paramount, no list price, PG-13), the Ted Danson-starring remake of 
"Cousin, Cousine." 
</P>
<P>
"Baby, It's You" (Paramount, no list price, R), a 1983 John Sayles film about 
the romance between an upper-class college student (Rosanna Arquette) and a 
working-class guy (Vincent Spano). 
</P>
<P>
"Who Done It?," "The Time of Their Lives," and "The Naughty Nineties," three 
Abbott &amp; Costello comedies made between 1942 and 1946 (MCA, $19.95 each). 
</P>
<P>
"Her Alibi" (Warner, $89.95, PG), a mystery-comedy about a novelist (Tom 
Selleck) who tries to prove the innocence of an accused murderer (Paulina 
Porizkova). 
</P>
<P>
"Rooftops" (IVE, $89.95, R), a Robert Wise-directed flop from earlier this 
year, about tenement teens. 
</P>
<P>
Price reductions: "Amadeus," "The Terminator," "No Way Out," "The Big Easy," 
"Hannah and Her Sisters" and "Three Amigos!" are now $19.99. "Red Heat" and 
"Howling IV" are $19.95. "Back to School," "The Squeeze," "Let's Get Harry" and 
"Desperately Seeking Susan" are $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
"Klassix-13" (MPI, $24.95 each) is the name of a new series of one-hour 
documentaries on the great composers and their works. The first four releases 
are on Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms. TERRY ATKINSON

3 SHELTER ALBUMS RELEASED IN JOINT VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Albums by Leon Russell, Freddie King and the Dwight Twilley Band have been 
released by DCC Compact Classics as part of the Northridge firm's new joint 
venture with Shelter Records. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Blonstein, president of DCC Compact Classics, said the first three 
albums from Shelter -- Russell's 1970 solo debut, King's 1971 "Getting Ready . 
. . " and Twilley's 1976 "Sincerely" -- are the first in a series of releases 
that will include additional albums by Russell, who formed Shelter Records in 
the late '60s with record producer Denny Cordell. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Hoffman, who digitally remastered the albums from Shelter's master tapes, 
said Russell's "Leon Russell and the Shelter People" (1971) and "Carney" (1972) 
are due in CD next month, along with Phoebe Snow's 1974 debut album, which 
contained "Poetry Man." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reprise Records has finally released in this country "Street Life," 
a retrospective of the best-known material by Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music. The 
album, which has been available in England for more than two years, contains 20 
songs and runs 74 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
A two-record vinyl set that is being released on a single disc, "Street Life" 
is especially welcome because there has been so little Roxy Music material 
available on CD in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The new releases, rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five (classic): 
</P>
<P>
**** Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music's "Street Life" (Reprise) -- Ferry's solo material 
is stylish, but his work with Roxy Music is even more involving because the 
best selections (including "Love Is the Drug" and "More Than This") combine 
Ferry's sentimental romanticism and the somewhat stark, sophisticated textures 
supplied by his band mates. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 Freddie King's "Getting Ready . . ." (DCC/Shelter) -- The late blues 
singer-guitarist's most prized work was for King Records in the '60s, but these 
12-tracks, produced by Russell and Don Nix, provide a respectable showcase of 
King's feel for both rock and blues. 
</P>
<P>
*** Leon Russell's "Leon Russell" (DCC/Shelter) -- This album documented 
Russell's great instincts for rock's country, blues and gospel roots and his 
songwriting skills ("Delta Lady," "A Song for You"), but his music was served 
up with even more intensity and spice in the later "Shelter People" and "Leon 
Live." 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 Dwight Twilley Band's "Sincerely" (DCC/Shelter) -- Twilley, whose band 
included singer-drummer Phil Seymour and lead guitarist Bill Pitcock IV, 
injected this album (and occasional later works) with a marvelously seductive 
blend of Beatles-style pop-rock and sensual rockabilly. The best tracks here -- 
including "I'm on Fire" and four bonus tracks -- reflect youthful rock 'n' roll 
desire as wonderfully as the equally underrated early Box Tops recordings.

Bill Moyers is going to civilize us all, if we can be. Having introduced us to 
the persistence of heroic myth through the writings of the late Joseph 
Campbell, Moyers now commends or commands our attention to the sadly 
underconsumed art of poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Moyers' six-part series on poetry, "The Power of the Word," premieres tonight 
at 9 along the PBS network, including Channels 28 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
Poetry, the Mexican poet-diplomat Octavio Paz says during the program, was once 
the central art of society. Today it is at best a marginal art. He adds that 
the United States has in the 20th Century produced some of the great poets of 
the world. Paz hardly needs to point out that not one would qualify as a 
household name. 
</P>
<P>
Moyers offers a graceful and low-key introduction. "When I tell you this series 
is about poetry, some of you are going to reach for the dial," he says with 
fair accuracy. And yet, Moyers argues, the poets have "told him what they felt 
about falling in love, facing death, leaving home, losing faith, finding God, 
or seeing Magic Johnson do ballet with a basketball" (Quincy Troupe's "A Poem 
for 'Magic,' " to be heard in the second program of the series). 
</P>
<P>
Having made his personal case for the pleasures of listening to poetry, Moyers 
turns the program over to five poets, observed reading their work and talking 
about it during the 1988 session of the biennial Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry 
Festival in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The first program, subtitled "The Simple Acts of Life," makes no attempt (nor 
does the series as a whole, evidently) to assess the state of poetry. A 
marginal art it undoubtedly still is, yet there are plenty of signs of vitality 
-- readings, recordings, radio appearances, small press publications, organized 
pressure on newspapers to print more poetry and reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Direct expression -- immediate experience conveyed in language intended to be 
heard more than read -- seems central to a renewed popularity of the poetic 
word. And accessibility, relatively plain speech spiced with warmth and wit, is 
a linking chord among the first show's performers: Robert Bly, Galway Kinnell, 
Sharon Olds, Paz and William Stafford. 
</P>
<P>
Olds, who heads the creative writing program at NYU, and Kinnell, the 1983 
Pulitzer Prize winner for poetry, who also teaches at NYU, are both impressive 
in the candor of their poetry itself and for their unpretentious and concrete 
talk about the making of the poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Olds, giving a poem about her father a first public reading, is clearly 
taken aback at the end by the reawakening of the strong emotions that inspired 
the poem in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Olds and Kinnell conclude the program with an antiphonal reading of excerpts 
from their work on the common theme of sex. It is wonderfully affecting, 
neither coy nor within miles of prurience, but the private experience made 
universal: sex, and poetry, at their best. 
</P>
<P>
The program's background music is by The Paul Winter Consort. Dominated by 
flute and soprano saxophone, it is wispily, mournfully elegant. But it does 
reinforce the image of modern poetry as esoteric and elitist, which the poets 
themselves have been doing a fine job of contradicting. 
</P>
<P>
Save for some pretty shots of the autumnal East, the program is talking heads 
in the oldest PBS tradition. But the talk is what matters, and the faithful who 
don't reach for the dial are likely to have an illuminating if not an 
exhilarating time.

IT'S COUNTRY -- BUT IS THAT COOL?; 
</P>
<P>
KCSN'S FORMAT SWITCH COMES UP FOR REVIEW THIS FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rancor that once swirled around KCSN-FM has calmed of late and business is 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Two years after Cal State Northridge's public radio station made a 
controversial switch to all-country music, listener support has increased and 
quarreling within the station's management has lulled. A technical problem that 
caused spotty reception on campus appears soon to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
But another storm may be brewing on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, a newly formed executive board will review KCSN's format and decide 
the station's future. Such consideration could open old wounds as the group 
weighs opposing factors: 
</P>
<P>
Traditional country music has won KCSN new fans and increased donations from 
the outside community. At the same time, traditional country music has 
alienated many of the university's students and professors. 
</P>
<P>
"This format is working," said Ken Mills, newly hired as KCSN's general 
manager. "But it's very controversial on campus because traditional country 
music is not something that most people on campus can relate to. The radio 
station is not listened to by the vast majority of students. 
</P>
<P>
"How important is that? That's a question that has to be answered." 
</P>
<P>
KCSN (88.5) broadcasts to the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. Although 
the station originates from campus, it is licensed as a community radio 
station, and school administrators have maintained that the community comes 
first when it comes to programming decisions. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, KCSN played a mix of rock, country, classical and other styles. 
</P>
<P>
One theory of the radio business holds that consistency is a key to success. 
KUSC-FM, which programs strictly classical music, is an example. Public station 
KCRW-FM, on the other hand, has been successful with widely varied programming. 
</P>
<P>
KCSN's former general manager decided in September, 1988, that a consistent 
format would be the station's best shot at increasing its traditionally small 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Rock and modern country were ruled out because of the glut of such stations in 
Los Angeles. Classical and jazz weren't options because KCSN is funded by the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting and was not allowed to duplicate the 
programming of other public radio stations in the area. KUSC already had 
classical. KLON-FM already had jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge station selected traditional country. 
</P>
<P>
There was subsequent reaction from a citizens panel that acted as an adviser 
within KCSN's management structure. The panel strongly advised that the 
all-country format be dropped. Faculty members and students criticized the 
choice as well. Heated debates were the order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many different factions pulling in so many different directions. 
They were jabbing and picking and carping," said Robert Light, president 
emeritus of the Southern California Broadcasters Assn., who was president of 
the advisory panel. "If I'd had a gavel, I'd have broken the bloody thing." 
</P>
<P>
But management stuck by its decision, to mixed results. KCSN's audience has 
remained small at 30,000 listeners each month. Yet the station's spring 
fund-raising campaign garnered $38,000, up from $26,000 solicited the spring 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we still have a small audience, it's a sizable enough audience to 
support the station," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
With some of KCSN's financial problems soothed, school administrators next took 
action against the station's infighting. The citizens advisory panel was 
disbanded by the CSUN administration and replaced by an executive board 
consisting of three faculty members and administrators, a student and three 
community representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a much smaller group," said Light, who serves on the new board. "We 
have some control now. It's much better." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"The controversy has died down but very little change has occurred," said David 
Stibor, president of the Associated Students organization. "The programming of 
1940s country music is not suited to a college. The students still feel that 
the station needs to look to the student audience and play some things that the 
students want." 
</P>
<P>
Some faculty members have complained that a college-run station should be 
presenting something more intellectually stimulating than country music, said 
Charles T. Lynch, a professor in the department of radio, TV and film, who 
added that he supports the present format. 
</P>
<P>
The university's administration declined to comment before receiving a report 
from the executive board. The board will first meet Oct. 5 but may not complete 
its review until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Mills is working to appease various factions. KCSN has added a 
blues show and a weekly program highlighting early rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
" 'American roots' is the phrase we use to describe our programming," the 
general manager said. "We've broadened that phrase to include a few more roots. 
With specialized programs, like the blues program, maybe we can draw more 
student support." 
</P>
<P>
The station will also receive a technical boost this fall. Back in 1987, about 
the same time that KCSN switched to traditional country, it also switched to a 
mountaintop transmitter that increased its broadcast area. However, the 
transmitter could not reach certain "shadow" zones, most notably the 
university's campus. Addition of the new equipment will allow radios to pick up 
KCSN at 88.3 on campus and in surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"That is psychologically very important," Mills said. "It's a frustrating 
situation not to be able to get the radio station in the parking lot in front 
of the radio station." 
</P>
<P>
All of this occurs as KCSN embarks on its fall fund-raising campaign, which 
begins today. 
</P>
<P>
"Chances are greater that we'll stick with the format we have," said Light, 
looking forward to the board review. "It's been quite satisfactory."

HORTOBAGY'S FARE STAKES OUT A BIT OF TRANSYLVANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something must have been very wrong with Count Dracula. Why else would a landed 
nobleman living in a country blessed with richly satisfying cooking have 
developed a taste for human blood? Worse yet, he made a laughingstock of his 
Transylvanian homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Transylvania (since World War I a part of Romania) is no laughing matter at 
Hortobagy (hor-toe-bazh) Hungarian restaurant in Studio City. Transylvanian 
goulash and Transylvanian flekken are prominent on this venerable restaurant's 
menu. 
</P>
<P>
Hortobagy has been serving reliable Hungarian peasant cooking for a long time 
-- I've even written appreciatively about it, though some years ago. In the 
intervening flood of restaurant developments, however, I'd forgotten about it. 
But there it is still, now huddling next to a multistory office building where 
you navigate the big curve on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City. After so many 
years and so many changes in eating habits, it hadn't seemed possible that it 
could still exist. 
</P>
<P>
Entering its pristine interior did nothing to alleviate my fear that the whole 
experience was a dream, that if I spoke, the peasant decor would turn to stark 
white and the food to dust. Far from it. Although the maternal waitress who 
once picked up my plate, looked at it, put it down and said, "Eat your 
potatoes!" is gone, little else seems to have changed. 
</P>
<P>
The prices are low, as always. Most lunch entrees are $5.25, and dinners 
(including a four-course prix fixe dinner) are about $9.80. Hard as this is to 
believe, it's harder still to believe that the food, on the whole, is really 
good, and the portions large. This might be among the last of the inexpensive 
homey ethnic restaurants that once bridged the culinary gap between bland 
American cooking and pretentious French cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
At Hortobagy, it was comforting to rediscover among the appetizers the savory 
red cabbage vitalized with caraway seeds, vinegar, black pepper and brown 
sugar. I liked it so much that it stayed on the table through the main course 
so I could dip into it from time to time as a condiment. It goes well with 
everything on the menu. The cucumber salad -- cucumber slices, with onion in 
vinegar -- though refreshing, was awfully tame by comparison. And although 
there was nothing wrong with the chopped liver, it was as flat as an unseasoned 
egg salad, which it resembled. 
</P>
<P>
The prix fixe dinner is characteristic of a meal at Hortobagy. After the red 
cabbage comes a plate overflowing with meat and potatoes. In this case, the 
meat is two generous slices of richly flavored marinated roast pork. The 
potatoes are also unexpectedly flavorsome, infused, I imagine, with meat juices 
and black pepper. Included in the dinner is a palacsinta and coffee. Palacsinta 
is an egg-batter crepe offered with apricot jam filling with or without ground 
walnuts and sugar. Either way, it is a memorable dessert, one which might well 
bring you back for more. 
</P>
<P>
The main dishes are meats either roasted, breaded with a light hand or served 
with a fairly delicate cream sauce. The roast duck, half a bird, was almost 
painfully plain, but crisp and moist nonetheless. There are various breaded 
veal and pork cutlets, and the cream-sauced dishes are the goulashes. They are 
not stews as we usually think of them (except for the goulash soup), but rather 
good-sized tender chunks of veal waiting to be broken open and washed with the 
surrounding rich sauce. Uncharacteristically, among generally moist meats, the 
sliced veal was dry, unlike the Transylvanian flekken, which unites a pork 
cutlet with the potatoes and red cabbage whose marinade permeates the meat. 
</P>
<P>
These dishes were basically the sustenance of herdsmen on the vast Hortobagy 
plain. A fitting tribute to those hearty eaters is Hortobagy's wood platter, 
mounded with enough food to more than satisfy two tired road jockeys worn out 
from wrangling Colts and Mustangs on the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Counting from top to bottom, it consists of a rasher of crisp bacon, a large 
sausage, two deep-fried mushroom caps, two large deep-fried meat loaf 
croquettes so well-spiced and textured I thought that they were sausages, a 
pork chop, two pieces of fried liver and two breaded veal cutlets, all mounded 
on top of copious portions of potatoes, red cabbage and rice cooked in broth. 
Except for the liver, which had its life cooked out of it, this daunting 
display of excess (at the most unexcessive price of $22.80 for two people) was 
so tasty that two urban eaters finished it off with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, the palacsinta was even better than I remembered. The other 
desserts, alas, have not worn well over the years. Plum dumplings, once an 
amazing confection (of steamed potato dough filled with dark plum jam), were 
soggy and over-sweet. The mocha torte was no longer the light-textured 
cream-filled cake I remembered, although it still looked like a mini-terry 
cloth bath towel draped over its plate. 
</P>
<P>
Like many national cuisines, Hungary's is far more complex than one restaurant 
can offer. Although Hortobagy offers only the hearty type of Hungarian cooking 
(I am still waiting for fish, goose and fruit dishes), it's one of the best 
restaurant values in the city and I'm very glad it's still there. 
</P>
<P>
Eat your heart out, Count Dracula. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: goulash soup, $5.90; wood plate (for two), $22.80; 
palacsinta, $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hortobagy, 11138 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. (818) 980-2273. Open noon to 10 
p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. Beer and wine. Cash only. Parking lot. Dinner 
for two, food only, $20-$35.

FINEGOOD GALLERY VOLUNTEERS GIVE A HAND AND A HEART TO JEWISH ART; 
</P>
<P>
A COMMITTEE OF 30 CHOOSES ARTWORK, RUNS EXHIBITS ON BERNARD MILKEN CAMPUS 
</P>

<P>
As openings go, the one at the Finegood Art Gallery six years ago wasn't 
exactly grand. 
</P>
<P>
In a small trailer on an empty West Hills lot, a few volunteers pushed aside 
stacks of chairs, pounded nails through cheap wooden panels and hung some 
paintings and prints. The only people who viewed the art show were members of 
the Valley Region of the Jewish Federation Council of Los Angeles, who were 
using the trailer as a temporary boardroom. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to try to cram an awful lot of art in that small space," said Carole 
Friedman, one of the gallery's four founders. 
</P>
<P>
Today there's no need to fit anything into cramped quarters. The Finegood 
Gallery is a well-lit, 2,500-square-foot room with plenty of space for 
displaying art and plenty of volunteers to organize exhibits. It is located on 
the Bernard Milken Jewish Community Campus, a 6.5-acre complex that houses the 
West Valley Jewish Community Center and the Jewish Federation Council's Valley 
Region office. The council is the central coordinating and fund-raising 
organization for 15 local Jewish agencies that offer health, education and 
social services. 
</P>
<P>
David and Rae Finegood of West Los Angeles donated the money for the gallery, 
which opened, with the campus, in 1987. "Viewing and appreciating arts is an 
important cultural activity," David Finegood said. "I think it's a valuable 
contribution for people who come to the center." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery is run by a committee of 30 volunteers, who call themselves the 
Valley Region Arts Council. The members choose the exhibits, serve as docents, 
help mount the works and hold receptions for the artists. 
</P>
<P>
The Arts Council's goal, says committee co-chair Marjorie Sievers, is to 
educate the public about the contributions of Jewish artists, although the 
gallery does not exhibit exclusively Jewish art. "We try to have exhibits of 
sophisticated, avant-garde art," as well as religious art, Sievers said. "We 
like to have the newest modern art as well as ancient pieces." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the gallery has only shown the works of Los Angeles-area artists, but 
the volunteers hope to exhibit the works of Israelis and Soviet immigrants in 
the next year. Artists can submit slides to the Arts Council for consideration. 
Prices of works in the gallery range from $100 to $10,000. Commissions are 
usually 25%. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery's present exhibition is "Jewish Art: From the Hand and the Heart." 
The six-artist show features elaborate, hand-painted ketuboth, Jewish marriage 
contracts; huppoth, canopies under which marriage ceremonies take place, and 
hand-woven tallits, Jewish prayer shawls. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful huppoth, made of hand-woven silks from the Far East, are crafted 
by Shoshana Enosh, a weaver from Woodland Hills. Some are subdued, made from 
light pink, blue and cream-colored silks and trimmed with lace. Others are more 
festive, with stripes of magenta, aqua, orange and green and trimmed with 
fringe. All are inscribed with the Hebrew words for "I am my beloved and my 
beloved is mine." 
</P>
<P>
"Color is really an expression of happiness," said Enosh, who made her first 
huppahtwo years ago for her daughter's wedding. "I think ceremonial objects for 
an occasion should be joyous, not solemn." 
</P>
<P>
The show continues through Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
The Arts Council pays its expenses though donations and revenues from exhibits. 
The council also raises money by holding tours of Los Angeles artists' studios 
and collectors' homes. The cost of maintaining the gallery is absorbed by the 
building's operating budget, which comes from Jewish Federation Council funds. 
</P>
<P>
The days of cramped quarters and cheap wooden panels are over, but Arts Council 
members say the gallery is far from complete. They still need moldings to hang 
works -- now they use nails, then patch up the holes -- and they would like 
permanent display cases. They're hoping to find sponsors for entire exhibits 
and eventually have a full-time gallery director. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come a long way," said Shoshana Hirsh, the Federation Council's Valley 
Region staff member who oversees the gallery. "But we've still got a long way 
to go."

Thirty-four white men turned down for firefighting jobs in Boston even though 
they had perfect scores on a civil service exam sued to force the department to 
adopt a color-blind hiring policy. Spurred by a recent U.S. Supreme Court 
decision paving the way for such lawsuits, the plaintiffs said they were 
seeking a court ruling allowing them to be hired. "We're not trying to deprive 
anybody," said plaintiff Larry Mackin. "We just want the best man to win." 
Boston has long been under a federal consent decree requiring it to hire one 
minority for every white to ensure the police and fire departments reflect the 
city's ethnic makeup. But Mackin said the policy has foiled his efforts for 12 
years, and that he has always scored well on the civil service exam.

An angry Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said a new book on Robert H. Bork's 
ill-fated Supreme Court nomination incorrectly states Rehnquist broke a promise 
to keep Justice Lewis F. Powell's impending retirement a secret. In the book, 
"Battle for Justice," author Ethan Bronner says Powell told Rehnquist on June 
25, 1987, that he would announce his retirement the following day and asked for 
"a solemn promise" to keep it a secret overnight. The book says Rehnquist then 
called White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker with the news, and Baker told 
President Ronald Reagan. "That statement is in error," Rehnquist said. "I 
notified Howard Baker of the retirement shortly before we went on the bench on 
the morning of Friday, June 26, 1987." Bronner, however, said a tape-recorded 
interview with Baker supports his account of Rehnquist's action.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in an attempt to ease nationalist 
tension in the Baltic republics, met with the leaders of those republics -- 
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia -- and supported their drive for greater 
autonomy, Estonian party chief Vaino Valjas said. Valjas told Estonian 
television that Gorbachev expressed concern that his perestroika program was 
threatened by conservatives, however, and that it was necessary for reformers 
in both Moscow and the Baltics to be united. Next week, the Soviet Central 
Committee is scheduled to meet, and the Baltics' effort is expected to be a 
major issue.

Mother Teresa was reported in serious condition in an intensive care unit in 
Calcutta, where doctors used external cardiac massage to help the 79-year-old 
Nobel laureate after she suffered a mild heart attack. The frail nun has been 
in Woodlands Nursing Home for 10 days with a heart problem, for which she has 
been under medication since 1983. Ashim Bardhan, head of the medical team 
treating her, said she had been improving until Wednesday evening, when she 
suffered a mild coronary seizure. He said an external pacemaker was sending 
small currents of electricity to stimulate her heart muscles and regularize her 
erratic heartbeat.

The crew of the shuttle Atlantis reviewed emergency escape procedures during a 
final dress-rehearsal countdown at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida before 
blastoff Oct. 12 on a high-priority flight to fire the nuclear-powered Galileo 
probe to Jupiter. Fearful of a radiation release in the event of a launch 
catastrophe, anti-nuclear activists have vowed to trespass at the Kennedy Space 
Center to delay the long-awaited flight, but the shuttle astronauts said they 
were confident the mission will get off the ground on time.

A research group in San Francisco is opposing the city's proposed domestic 
partners law, which would give unwed municipal employees the same hospital

oppose the measure on the November ballot -- warned that the proposed law could 
lead to larger efforts to broaden health benefits and regulate private business

A small bomb shattered the window of a York, England, bookstore owned by the 
publisher of Salman Rushdie's controversial novel "The Satanic Verses," and 
bombs were found at three of the publisher's stores in other towns, police 
said. The bomb at the Viking Penguin bookstore in the northern city of York 
caused no injuries and only slight damage. Police said that bombs at 
Peterborough, in central England, and Guildford, in the south, were defused. 
Another, in the Midlands city of Nottingham, was blown up by army bomb disposal 
experts after the area around the shop was evacuated. Muslims around the world 
have accused Rusdhie of blaspheming Islam in the book, and Iran has called for 
his death.

A parliamentary committee recommended that former Greek Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou stand trial on charges stemming from his alleged involvement in a 
multimillion-dollar bank embezzlement scandal. Parliament will vote on the 
matter later this month. The committee, which investigated the scandal at the 
privately owned Bank of Crete where more than $200 million is missing, 
recommended that Papandreou, 70, be tried on three charges -- authorizing a 
scheme to skim interest rates on state accounts at the bank, accepting bribes 
and receiving part of the embezzled money.

<P>
FOR BRADLEY, IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT SPEECH OF HIS POLITICAL LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After weeks of planning, meetings with his closest political, media and legal 
advisers and countless rewrites of what was arguably the most important speech 
in his 26-year political career, Mayor Tom Bradley strode into his conference 
room. 
</P>
<P>
The room had been transformed, like a Hollywood set, to resemble the chief 
executive's office. Using a tissue to pat beads of sweat on his balding head 
and being careful to not smudge his make-up, Bradley waited for his cue from 
Press Secretary William Chandler at precisely 5:02 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill, Bill, give me the countdown," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
With seconds to go, Chandler flashed his fingers for the final countdown. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley then embarked on an unprecedented 40-minute speech, broadcast live 
during the prime television news hour, and answered questions for another 20 
minutes from reporters about City Atty. James K. Hahn's scathing 1,650-page 
report on conflict-of-interest allegations. 
</P>
<P>
To take his case "to the people," as the mayor said he wanted to do, was a 
calculated risk. On one hand, the live broadcast had the advantage of allowing 
Bradley an unfiltered appeal directly to the people, according to political 
consultants and experts. But the tactic required that the mayor convincingly 
tell his version of a complex series of transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Every detail, from the three flags and blue velvet curtains hung behind him to 
the massive desk moved into the conference room, was designed to set a tone and 
send a message to what the mayor and his staff hoped would be an audience of 
hundreds of thousands of Los Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
While some media consultants on Thursday were applauding the mayor's ability to 
manipulate the media into providing him with uninterrupted prime television 
news time on the three largest stations in the market, aides to the mayor 
acknowledged that they really planned on getting just 10 minutes of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
And some consultants said that extended performance may have cost him some 
audience and some credibility. 
</P>
<P>
"The speech was in two parts," said one mayoral aide who asked not to be 
identified. "There was a 10-minute opening statement" and then the mayor 
digressed into a somber recitation of his responses to the city attorney's 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured the stations would cut out after the first 10 or 15 minutes," the 
aide said. 
</P>
<P>
But due to what television officials said was competitive pressures -- "we're 
all waiting to see who blinks first," said one producer -- and a sense of good 
public affairs programming, all three network affiliates in Los Angeles stayed 
on with the entire address and much of the question-and-answer period. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, that can cut two ways," said Ken Khachigian, a veteran speech 
writer who has written for Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard M. Nixon and 
for Gov. George Deukmejian. "The live speech allows you to tell your side of 
the story. But it also ties a big red ribbon around it that says, 'This is a 
big deal and if you don't believe it, here's 40 minutes of television about 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Khachigian said the politician can appear to "protest too much when struggling 
to explain the thing. . . . The common man then thinks, 'This guy stepped in a 
pile of it and he is trying to get out. . . . It's like quicksand: the more you 
struggle, the more you're in it." And that impression, he said, "is a major, 
negative down side." 
</P>
<P>
Still, media consultants said Bradley's strategists staged an impressive show 
and managed to get exactly the context they wanted for the mayor's long-awaited 
address. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of going live, rather than through a filter (reporters and editors) 
was very, very smart," said one Los Angeles-based media consultant who did not 
want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
And the make-believe office setting -- "the flag, the desk, the blue" -- was 
intended to "look presidential, and it did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The desk, and absence of reporters from the screen "made it look like 'let me 
sit down and talk to you man to man. . . . We don't need these other folks to 
get in the way,' " the consultant said. 
</P>
<P>
The set, and the tone -- to explain rather than apologize -- were both 
conditions set by Bradley, over some staff objections, according to aides. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley wanted to walk viewers through each of the controversial financial 
transactions, while some aides argued, "don't give (the press) anything to poke 
holes in," said another aide. 
</P>
<P>
The television stations -- KNBC, KABC and KCBS -- took risks of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The stations, in staying live with the complete address, gave up valuable 
advertising time and viewership. 
</P>
<P>
At KNBC, for instance, only 27% of viewers actually live in Los Angeles, 
officials said. And many viewers were not interested in the topic or got bored 
with the length of the speech, overnight ratings figures show. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC, which normally has about 20% of the viewing market between 5 and 6 p.m., 
fell to about 13% during Bradley's address.

HAHN'S REPORT, MAYOR'S SPEECH POINT UP MEMORY LAPSES, CONTRADICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL SAPPELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city attorney's report on Tom Bradley revealed that the mayor had memory 
lapses on crucial matters being explored by investigators and that some key 
documents on his dealings with a bank that hired him as an adviser were 
"missing" from his office files. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in his televised speech Wednesday night, Bradley seemed to contradict 
earlier statements about his reasons for resigning as Far East National Bank's 
only paid adviser and returning the $18,000 he had been paid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Cites Letters 
</P>
<P>
In his wide-ranging investigative report, City Atty. James K. Hahn cited three 
1988 letters that Far East President Henry Hwang sent to Bradley and that the 
mayor insisted he could not remember seeing. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those were disclosed for the first time in Hahn's report. They were 
obtained from Far East Bank. 
</P>
<P>
All three were pivotal in Hahn's efforts to determine whether Bradley knew that 
Far East was seeking -- or had received -- deposits of taxpayer funds while he 
was working for the bank. Bradley had consistently maintained that the bank did 
not ask him for help in obtaining city deposits. He also said he was not aware 
of any business relationship between Far East and the city until March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Marking them "personal and confidential," Hwang sent the following letters to 
Bradley at his City Hall office within four months of putting him on the bank's 
payroll: 
</P>
<P>
* Hwang wrote to "Tom" on Jan. 13 expressing his gratitude for the mayor's 
acceptance of a paid advisory post with the bank. In the previously undisclosed 
letter, Hwang outlined areas in which he wanted Bradley's help in getting 
business for the bank, including developing ties to the city of Los Angeles. 
"In exchange for your valuable services," Hwang wrote, "we will pay you a 
retainer fee of $18,000 for 1988." 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office was told that this letter does not appear in 
correspondence logs maintained by the mayor's office. Bradley said he had no 
recollection of it. 
</P>
<P>
* Six days later, on Jan. 19, Hwang wrote another letter stating that "we wish 
to express our interest in receiving deposits and rendering bank services to 
the city of Los Angeles." The letter was quickly dispatched to the city 
treasurer by a Bradley aide -- with the notation "RUSH." Within days, a 
$1-million deposit of public funds was placed with Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang told city attorney officials that he believed that Bradley had asked him 
to send the letter. Bradley told investigators that he did not remember such a 
conversation or seeing the correspondence when it arrived. 
</P>
<P>
* In the other previously undisclosed letter, Hwang informed Bradley on April 6 
that the city had placed a $1-million deposit with Far East. Investigators 
considered that disclosure important because it suggested that the mayor knew 
of a depository relationship between the city and the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's aides said they had no record of the mayor receiving this letter, and 
Bradley said he could not remember it. 
</P>
<P>
In his report, and during an interview, Hahn expressed skepticism about the 
mayor's inability to recall these key communications with Hwang. 
</P>
<P>
"I have questions about the explanation the mayor has given us," Hahn told The 
Times. "I have questions because there appear to be inconsistencies." 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney noted in his report that "Mayor Bradley claims he never 
received two of these letters . . . and claims there are no correspondence 
index cards showing that they were received. . . . The circumstantial evidence 
appears damaging and may call into question the mayor's credibility and 
judgment in some areas." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, in his televised appearance Wednesday night, said he did not recall 
the letters because he reviews "thousands of pages of material" each week. 
</P>
<P>
"I dealt with the Far East documents in a routine way," he said, "the same way 
I deal with thousands of other questions I get from constituents every year. I 
didn't attach any greater significance to these." 
</P>
<P>
Another inconsistency that surfaced in Hahn's report cast doubt on Bradley's 
initial account of his actions before accepting a job with Far East. 
</P>
<P>
For months, Bradley and his aides have said that the mayor asked Hwang whether 
his bank had any business with the city. According to this version, Bradley 
accepted the paid position only after Hwang informed him that the bank had no 
city business at the time. But, in interviews with city attorney officials and 
on Wednesday, Bradley said that, in fact, he did not make such an inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about this by reporters, Bradley said his statements to the city 
attorney spoke for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In his Wednesday address, Bradley also seemed to change his version of why he 
returned his adviser fees to Far East. 
</P>
<P>
After Bradley disclosed in March that he was returning the $18,000, he 
portrayed it in letters to Hwang and the city attorney as a move based on 
ethical considerations. 
</P>
<P>
"I never would have accepted the fees in the first place had I known that the 
bank sought city deposits," he wrote to the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
But in his 40-minute televised speech, Bradley spoke of how the relationship 
with the bank could be misconstrued by political opponents. And he added that 
being paid as an "international trade adviser" by a bank in which the city 
deposited public funds did not pose an ethical dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw no connection between my circumscribed role with the bank and the 
independent investment decisions made by the city treasurer," he said.

U.S. AGENTS SEIZE BOATS, CARS IN PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
PROPERTY OWNED BY DEPUTIES IN DRUG UNIT HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Federal agents, investigating nine Los Angeles County sheriff's narcotics 
officers in connection with missing drug money, have seized personal property 
owned by officers, sources said Thursday. And the mother of one of the 
suspended investigators complained that her car was confiscated as part of the 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, sources close to the investigation said that the homes and offices 
of eight deputies and their supervisor have been searched. All were relieved of 
duty on Sept. 1 amid allegations that tens of thousands of dollars in drug 
money seized in narcotics raids was unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
Although court records remain sealed, one source said that in addition to the 
search warrants, "there were also seizure warrants" that targeted specific 
property owned by the narcotics officers. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Motor Vehicle records show that the officers own numerous 
late-model automobiles and one has an antique Ford. The Times has found that at 
least five of the officers own expensive boats and that two purchased the 
vessels with cash during the last 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
The source would not specify what property has been confiscated, but the mother 
of one deputy told The Times that her own car was seized last week by Internal 
Revenue Service agents. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Daub, whose son, Ronald E. Daub, was suspended two weeks ago, said that 
IRS and FBI agents appeared at her Van Nuys home last Tuesday with a warrant 
ordering her to surrender her 1988 Oldsmobile coupe. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Daub said she had paid about $13,000 in cash to a Whittier car rental 
agency for the used car but was told by federal agents that they believed that 
the money came from her son as part of some "ill-gotten gains" as a narcotics 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked me where I got my money (for the car) like I committed a crime or 
something," Mrs. Daub said. She said she had used some of her own savings, 
along with money provided by a younger son, to buy the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that I had saved money and had driven my old car for a long time," 
she said. "I've worked for most of my life, why isn't it possible that I bought 
it myself?" 
</P>
<P>
Her younger son, Reid, told The Times that he gave his mother some of the money 
with proceeds from a house sale. He added that his brother, the veteran deputy, 
had accompanied their mother to complete the car purchase -- but only because 
no other family member was available. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what my brother did or didn't do (on the narcotics team), my 
mother bought that car," Reid Daub said. "What right do they have to implicate 
my mother in this investigation?" 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Ronald Daub said he could not talk about the investigation on the advice 
of his attorney. Robert Giannangeli, a spokesman for the IRS, declined comment, 
as did Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas Hagemann, who is heading the federal 
money-skimming inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal laws require that before property can be seized, warrants 
must be filed in court establishing reason to believe that the property was 
purchased with funds gained illegally or was used in an illegal activity. The 
warrants remain sealed in this case. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Daub, the suspended officers include Sgt. Robert Sobel and 
Deputies Terrell H. Amers, James R. Bauder, Nancy A. Brown, Eufrasio G. Cortez, 
John C. Dickenson, Daniel M. Garner and Michael J. Kaliterna. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to some of the officers confirmed that vehicles had been taken 
by federal agents. But attorneys for two of the officers said they were unaware 
of any seizures. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Mark Beck, who represents Sobel, said none of his client's boats or 
cars had been confiscated. And Richard Hirsch, who is Bauder's lawyer, said 
that no cars or boats were taken from his client. The deputies have 
consistently declined comment or have been unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Daub said federal agents asked her not only about her car but also whether 
she had received any jewelry or expensive gifts recently from her deputy 
sheriff son. The clear implication, she said, was that if she had received any 
such gifts, it was from drug money. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like my civil rights were violated. . . . It was like, 'I'm his mother, 
so shoot me,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
The eight deputies and a sergeant -- all members of a narcotics investigation 
team -- were placed on administrative leave in what Sheriff Sherman Block 
called possibly the worst scandal in his seven-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
State records show that Sobel, Daub, Cortez, Amers and Kaliterna all own nearly 
new or costly boats. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, Sobel bought his 31-foot Huntermar sailboat for $31,500 
in cashier's checks and cash in June. He is the legal owner of the vessel, the 
state reports. The sergeant also owns a 1987 BMW and a 1988 Chevrolet Blazer. 
</P>
<P>
Daub also bought a boat for cash, his purchase coming in 1988 for $17,668 for a 
19-foot ski boat, sources said. Daub or his wife also own a 1988 motorcycle, 
are making payments on a 1987 Cadillac sedan and are leasing a 1986 Nissan 
coupe. 
</P>
<P>
Cortez bought a 20-foot, 1989 ski boat for about $23,000 a year ago and is the 
registered owner of a 1988 Chevy station wagon, a 1928 Ford and a 1978 Ford, 
the DMV reports. 
</P>
<P>
Kaliterna is the registered owner of a 19-foot ski boat, a 1989 Jeep and a 1984 
Oldsmobile. Amers is the registered owner of a 1989 ski and pleasure boat that 
is 22 1/2 feet long and a 1985 Chevrolet commercial vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Garner or his wife own a 1987 BMW 535i, a 1989 Ford Bronco, a 1980 Ford pickup 
and a 1986 off-road vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Registration information was incomplete or could not be found for the remaining 
deputies.

HANDLING OF ANTI-ABORTION GROUP'S PROTESTS REEVALUATED

</HEADLINE>

<P>
Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, jubilant over his acquittal on 
trespassing charges, returned to Los Angeles Thursday to rally his 
anti-abortion forces, while pro-choice organizations, police, and prosecutors 
nationwide reassessed how to handle future encounters with Terry's movement. 
</P>
<P>
Terry traveled from his New York home to hold a victory press conference and 
meet with Southern California activists, and he appeared almost giddy as he 
deplaned. The 30-year-old anti-abortion leader said he had heard of the verdict 
while attending a church meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We praised the glory of God," he said, "and all I could think about was the 
Bible saying, 'The lord will make the justice of our cause shine like the 
noonday sun.' " 
</P>
<P>
Terry and co-leaders Jeff White, 31; Michael McMonagle, 36; Andrew Eppink, 41, 
and Donald Bennette, 36, were found not guilty Wednesday on 24 misdemeanor 
charges stemming from the Easter Week blockade of a Los Angeles women's clinic. 
Municipal Judge Richard Paez declared a mistrial on three remaining conspiracy 
counts after jurors said they could not reach a decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allegations of Police Brutality 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, some jurors said they were swayed in part by allegations of 
police brutality made by the activists during the trial. Others said they were 
opposed to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Terry said he and his co-defendants were ecstatic that "the jury understood our 
argument that saving children's lives is not a crime." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice activists, meanwhile, expressed concern that Operation Rescue will 
be invigorated. "I am concerned that Operation Rescue will think it has a 
license to break the law in Los Angeles," said ACLU attorney Carol Sobel, who 
testified during the activists' five-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, a former used car salesman, said the court decision has "stirred up our 
troops." He added that Operation Rescue had nine demonstrations planned in the 
near future for Southern California, including a demonstration in San Diego 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been banging heads on walls for years in courts," Terry said, "but the 
tide is turning. This is tremendous encouragement that our message is getting 
through." 
</P>
<P>
Some pro-choice activists believed that the court decision will set back their 
struggle to battle the activists with arrests, lawsuits and huge court fines. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have found that they can charge police brutality, and it tames 
the cops," said Ann Baker, who heads a pro-choice organization called the 80% 
Majority Campaign. "Practically any time these people don't get the treatment 
they want from the cops, they yell police brutality." Sobel said such 
allegations might make police hesitant to make arrests during the blockades. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a concern that the police might say, 'What's the point of doing 
arrests.' " Sobel said, "because nobody's going to be convicted anyway. Let's 
just let the two sides duke it out.' " 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, where Operation Rescue plans to stage protests this weekend, 
police spokesman David Cohen said his department does not intend to let emotion 
keep them from performing their duties. Cohen recalled past protests in which 
officers were taunted by demonstrators who accused them of allowing murder to 
take place inside the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Upholding the Law' 
</P>
<P>
"They want to draw us into the issue of abortion," he said. "We have officers 
who feel both ways, but when they put on their uniforms, they are upholding the 
law." 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. William Booth, spokesman for Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, 
said the department has no plans to change its policies or tactics because of 
the brutality allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"There may have been some misunderstanding of what was done, of what tactics 
were used out there," said Booth, referring to the pain compliance holds used 
by police during the March protest. "But that was the kind of misinterpretation 
that would be made by people who have never had to make someone come with them. 
Who have never had to lift someone up who was limp as a dish rag or stiff as a 
board." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police plan to use orcutts, plastic and nylon devices used as a 
weapon in the martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
"All officers have to do is bring it out of the holster, and the person plays 
by the rules," Cohen said. "If the protesters don't, then they can use them to 
take a person down into handcuff position." 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, there have been 25,000 to 35,000 arrests in Operation Rescue's 
self-proclaimed "holy war" against abortion, resulting in hundreds of 
trespassing cases -- many of which the anti-abortion forces have lost. They 
suffered a defeat Wednesday, when two members were found guilty of conspiracy 
and seven other misdemeanor criminal charges in San Diego Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important of the recent decisions was a ruling by a Los Angeles 
federal judge holding 12 Operation Rescue activists in contempt for violating a 
court order that prohibited them from blocking clinics in California. They were 
fined $10,000 apiece, a penalty that must be paid only if they violate the 
standing order again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
539 More Await Trial 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those acquitted Wednesday, 539 more activists await trial on 
trespassing charges from the March 25 protest in Los Angeles. A spokesman for 
the Los Angeles city attorney said "all legal remedies are under review." He 
would not comment on the prosecution's strategy or any alternative courtroom 
tactics they may use in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said the lesson in the verdict Wednesday was that the prosecution 
must understand jurors' bring extraordinary prejudices to such cases. 
</P>
<P>
"People are so polarized on this right-to-life issue," said Donald E. Vinson, 
founder of Litigation Sciences, which provides behavioral science consulting 
services to trial lawyers. "The values associated with the issue -- religion, 
sexuality, family -- are at the core of our humanity."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMBASSADOR OWNERS TO FIGHT SCHOOL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new owners of the historic Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles vowed Thursday 
to fight any attempt by the Los Angeles Unified School District to put a new 
high school on the Mid-Wilshire District property. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Wilshire Center Partners, originally known as Anglo-Wilshire 
Partners, completed the purchase of the 23.5-acre property for $64 million from 
the J. Myer Schine family. 
</P>
<P>
The sale went through despite city plans to build a 2,000-student high school 
on the site. The district has said it will buy the property or, if necessary, 
begin legal proceedings to claim it under its power of eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire area community groups have objected to the school plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We agree with the Los Angeles Mid-Wilshire community that the best use of that 
site is not a high school," said New York developer Scott Malkin, one of four 
partners in Wilshire Center. "We will fight any attempt to put a high school on 
the site. The fact we closed the transaction demonstrates our commitment to the 
property." 
</P>
<P>
School board President Jackie Goldbert said: "I'm sorry to hear that, but I am 
not surprised. . . . The school district is very committed to putting a school 
on the property."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHERS VOTE TO STRIKE ON OCT. 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beverly Hills teachers overwhelmingly approved a strike vote Thursday, setting 
the stage for a walkout if they fail to renegotiate increases in salary and 
benefits for the final year of their three-year contract, teachers' union 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers represented by the Beverly Hills Education Assn. voted 198 to 6 to 
strike if no agreement is reached by Oct. 16. A state mediator has been called 
in to conduct the 4-month-old contract negotiations, which resume Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The district is offering to increase teacher salaries 3.05% and to extend the 
existing bargaining agreement another year with a 5% wage increase for the 
1990-91 school year. Teachers, however, demand an immediate 11% raise or a 20% 
increase over two years. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills teachers start at a $21,604 annual salary and earn a maximum of 
$46,270, union officials said, pointing out that Los Angeles teachers signed a 
new contract this year with salaries ranging from $27,346 to $50,123. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared for what other districts are settling for, we have just lost so much 
ground," said union President Judy McIntire.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DELAYED BIDS OPENED ON FREEWAY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending more than two years of delay caused by a dispute over whether to include 
a car-pool lane, bids for widening the traffic-clogged Ventura Freeway across 
the San Fernando Valley were opened Thursday, preparing the way for 
construction in about two months, Caltrans officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
Highway engineers had worried that the project, estimated to cost $35.8 
million, might come in significantly over budget, forcing a new round of 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
But the low bid of $36.9 million submitted by Tutor-Saliba Corp. of Sylmar was 
only about 3% over the Caltrans estimate. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-month project is expected to bring short-term relief to the Valley's 
main east-west artery, which carries 280,000 vehicles daily and has eight to 10 
hours of congestion each weekday. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway, which is a patchwork of eight and 10-lane-wide sections, is to be 
expanded to 10 lanes from the Hollywood Freeway to Topanga Canyon Boulevard, a 
distance of 15 miles.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEX CHURCH LEADERS ALLEGE HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The self-professed leaders of a church that includes sex acts in its rituals 
asked Thursday for a federal court order prohibiting Los Angeles police and 
prosecutors from "harassing" the church and said they will appeal their recent 
conviction on prostitution charges. 
</P>
<P>
The request for a court order follows the filing of a lawsuit Wednesday against 
the Los Angeles Police Department and the city attorney's office claiming that 
Will and Mary Ellen Tracy of Canyon Country were persecuted by police and 
prosecutors because they practice an unorthodox religion. 
</P>
<P>
Will Tracy, 51, and his wife, 46, are scheduled to be sentenced next Friday 
after their conviction by a Municipal Court jury of operating a house of 
prostitution in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in federal court Wednesday, charges that authorities sought 
to deny the Tracys their freedom of religion and expression. Will Tracy on 
Thursday filed a request for the court order to bar the Police Department and 
city attorney from conducting surveillance on the church or making public 
statements about the religion. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William M. Byrne is scheduled to hear the request Monday.

ANGELS GLAD TO HAVE FINLEY BACK, BUT DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than three weeks have passed since Chuck Finley, warming up in the Royals 
Stadium bullpen, took one small step for a pitcher and one giant leap backward 
for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
It was just another pitch, made in preparation of just another start, until 
Finley completed his follow-through. 
</P>
<P>
A twist of the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
A wrenching of a foot ligament. 
</P>
<P>
And suddenly, an entire Angel team was sent reeling. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels lost that Monday night game in Kansas City, which Finley abandoned 
after only 17 painful pitches. They also lost 13 of their next 18 games -- 
including three turns in the rotation that should have been Finley's -- to drop 
from a first-place tie in the American League West to six games back on Sept. 
8. 
</P>
<P>
A recent surge at Anaheim Stadium -- a three-game sweep of the embattled Boston 
Red Sox followed by two come-from-behind victories over the New York Yankees -- 
has served mainly as a tease, exhuming the Angels for one last stand as they 
face a four-game deficit in the standings with 17 to play. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't much of a chance, but it's all the Angels have. 
</P>
<P>
And so, Chuck Finley, left foot willing, pitches tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just running out of days," said Finley, who will start the second game 
of tonight's rain-makeup doubleheader in Chicago. "The foot still gets a little 
sore here and there, but it shouldn't be enough to affect me. It's ready." 
</P>
<P>
Or so the Angels hope. 
</P>
<P>
According to Manager Doug Rader's pitching schedule, Finley will have the 
opportunity to make four more starts. If Finley pitches to pre-injury form, 
that could be enough to jostle the mix in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
But, realistically, what can the Angels expect from Finley the rest of the way? 
Their 26-year-old left-hander is a 14-game winner, a contender for the league 
earned-run average title (2.55) and a member of the 1989 AL All-Star team, but 
he also hasn't faced live hitting in 24 days. 
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, I'd like to pick up where I left off, but with all these days 
off, I can't say how it's going to be," Finley said. "I've been throwing all 
right on the sidelines, but that's on the sidelines. I haven't been running out 
there every fifth day." 
</P>
<P>
Marcel Lachemann, the Angels' pitching coach, concedes that the layoff has had 
a diminishing effect on Finley's once-precise control. 
</P>
<P>
"His stuff is pretty much the same, but his command is a little off," Lachemann 
said. "The simulated game (which Finley pitched Saturday) helped some, and the 
last time he threw on the side better. 
</P>
<P>
"He's throwing hard, but his location is still not all the way there. It'll 
come." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the way the Angels look at it, a rusty Chuck Finley sure beats any 
of their other options, who have spent most of the past three weeks getting 
beat. Including Finley's aborted outing on Aug. 21 at Kansas City, the Angels 
are 0-4 in starts that ordinarily would have belonged to Finley. 
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of the breakdown: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Aug. 21: Finley limps off the Royals Stadium mound after 17 pitches, 
already trailing, 1-0. Relief pitchers Willie Fraser and Rich Monteleone give 
up three more runs during the next four innings and the Angels lose, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Aug. 26: Terry Clark, an Edmonton recall, takes Finley's next turn in the 
rotation and lasts 4 2/3 innings. He allows six hits and three runs while 
balking once and throwing two wild pitches. The Angels lose to Texas, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sept. 1: Clark gets the call against the slumping Yankees. He doesn't get 
out of the second inning. Clark leaves after 1 1/3 innings, eventually charged 
with four runs on five hits and a walk. The Angels lose, 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sept. 6: Dan Petry's number comes up, although he probably wishes it 
hadn't. Petry serves up home runs to old (Robin Yount) and new (George Canale) 
alike, yielding four runs on four hits and three walks through four innings. 
The Angels lose to Milwaukee, 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sept. 11: An off-day on the Angel schedule, which Angels regard as a 
victory. They can skip Finley's turn in the rotation, thus sparing themselves 
an experiment with rookie Mike Fetters or, perhaps, middle reliever Willie 
Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
In Finley's absence, replacement starters combined to allow 11 runs (nine 
earned) on 15 hits in 10 innings. That works out to three innings per start and 
an earned-run average of 8.10. 
</P>
<P>
If Finley never takes that turn for the worst, makes those four starts and, 
say, splits them, the Angels are two games back and the outcome of the AL West 
race is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you lose one of your top starters, your 1-2-3 starters, I don't think 
anybody realistically has anyone they can put in there and fill that spot," 
Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I don't know if demoralizing's the word, but (Finley's injury) happened 
at the start of the road trip -- a very long road trip and a very important 
road trip. When it happened when it did, obviously, it hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Finley can only speculate on what might have been had he been there. 
</P>
<P>
"We might've been sitting a half-game out . . . or we might've been eight games 
out," he said with a grin. "Sometimes I think that if I'd been there, maybe I 
could've made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"When August came around, everybody looked at that road trip as the key trip, 
because it was so long. If we'd been able to play .500, or just below, we'd be 
right in the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Angels went 4-11, which pained Finley more than the sprained 
ligament in his foot. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because I was at home doesn't mean I wasn't hurting just as bad as they 
were," Finley said. "I called up Bert (Blyleven), a couple of the other guys, 
during the trip. I told them they were doing a good job. But it was hard enough 
watching them, let alone trying to cheer them up." 
</P>
<P>
So far in September, Finley's contributions have been, in his own words, 
"taking up another seat on the bench and eating a little spread." Finally off 
the disabled list, he gets the chance to change that tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Being on the bench, on the sidelines, stinks," Finley said. "This was one of 
those years where everything was going my way. I was doing good, pitching 
consistently, and every game seemed to get better. 
</P>
<P>
"But this has probably happened to a lot of guys before. I'm not going to sit 
here and cry, 'If I'd done this or done that.' The injury was outside my 
control. The only thing I can control is my next four starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad to get the chance to contribute again."

OTIS WILSON CUT A SECOND TIME BY THE RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following the bouncing Otis. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In yet another surprise announcement, Otis Wilson hit the waiver wire again 
Thursday, when the Raiders released him for the second time in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
For those keeping score, they have now signed him to a $1.15-million contract, 
cut him, re-signed him to a smaller contract, put him back in the starting 
lineup for last week's opener . . . and cut him again. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, now as then, was his surgically repaired knee. The Raiders felt it 
was worth taking one more look at -- provided they could cut his salary down to 
size -- and then didn't like what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
And if it wasn't already the unkindest cut of all, try this: Wilson had been 
given Thursday off to be with his wife, who was about to deliver their third 
child. Coach Mike Shanahan wound up reaching him at the hospital and telling 
him over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Otis has been around," Shanahan said. "I'm sure, obviously, he was 
surprised a little. But he took it like a man. The bottom line, Emanuel King 
was going to get an opportunity to become a starter this week and Otis cannot 
help us at this time on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Otis just hasn't been able to go full speed. He hasn't been able to do the job 
we'd like to have him do at that position. We've been patient with it. We 
thought it might come around a little bit quicker than it has. The best way to 
put it, he's not 100%. He's given great effort. At the same time, he's not 
making the plays he should make." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson grew to fame as a Chicago Bears outside linebacker. A six-year starter, 
he made the Pro Bowl in their Super Bowl season, 1985, when he had 11 1/2 sacks 
in the regular season, and two more in the Super Bowl rout of the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, however, he suffered a knee injury in an exhibition game at Dallas, 
underwent major surgery and missed the entire season. The Bears left him 
unprotected in the Plan B free agency period and the Raiders grabbed him, 
signing him to a contract that would have paid him $550,000 this season and 
$600,000 next. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was unable to work in pads for the first two weeks of camp, but midway 
through the exhibition season, the Raiders inserted him into the starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the first surprise, they put him on waivers six days before the start 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
A day later, he was back in uniform and running with the first team. He had 
cleared waivers and the Raiders had re-signed him, reportedly for a $250,000 
cut to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson then started last week's 40-14 victory over the Chargers. He was 
credited with two tackles and no assists. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, he was gone again. 
</P>
<P>
Having started the season with him, the Raiders are obligated to pay Wilson 
half his salary. Such veterans are often treated as unofficial auxiliaries (the 
Raiders, for example, have signed offensive lineman Dwight Wheeler about a 
dozen times in the '80s). Thus, it isn't impossible that Wilson could rejoin 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
One last poignant note: Wilson turns 32 today.

JIM MURRAY: ALLEN HASN'T FORGOTTEN WAY TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one cared about the spread. Las Vegas didn't even post a line on the game. 
ABC yawned. Thousands of people managed to stay home on game day. A bowl wasn't 
at stake. The polls ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside College vs. Northwestern Iowa is not your basic stop-the-presses 
intersectional encounter. For one thing, Morningside had lost its last 15 
games. The game was at 4:30 p.m., not because of television but so it shouldn't 
interfere with dinner. Besides, lights are expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside needed a gimmick. It was in danger of dropping football, to say 
nothing of a lot of other things. Sioux City was losing population. Apathy was 
endemic. 
</P>
<P>
Its principal claim to fame is that it was, so to speak, the coaching 
birthplace of George Allen. Now, George Allen is one of the registered geniuses 
of his profession, a coach who should be in the pro Hall of Fame, the most 
successful coach, in winning percentage (116-47-5) in pro football history, a 
Super Bowl coach. There is very little about X's and O's George Allen doesn't 
know. There is nothing about motivation he doesn't know. 
</P>
<P>
He had coached at Morningside 41 years ago -- successfully. The school thought 
it would be a nice gesture if George came back this year as a kind of symbolic 
salute, an attention-caller. A stunt. 
</P>
<P>
They thought George would make an appearance, talk at a dinner, hit a 
television station or two, get a plaque, wave to the crowd, ride around in an 
open car. The usual drill in these kinds of things. Just a bit of weekend 
nostalgia. Auld Lang Syne. After all, George Allen is 72. 
</P>
<P>
Hah! 
</P>
<P>
George Allen is not a weekend anything. George Allen did not go back to 
Morningside the Friday before the game. George went back two weeks before the 
game. George pulled out the depth charts, went over the offensive and defensive 
line stunts, the backfield schemes. 
</P>
<P>
George went out on the sidelines, rolled up his sleeves, did his patented 
lip-pulling with his fingers, clapped his hands, gathered the team about him 
and gave them one of his standard George Allen pep talks ("Confidence wins more 
games than trick plays," he explains) and, in general, acted like a coach 
getting them ready for the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Allen was in his element. "We put in the nickel defense," he chortles. "We 
worked with the special teams. We went over zones. We told them what we wanted. 
I reminded them that I was the guy who got the special teams introduced on 
television in a Monday night game once over the combined opposition of the 
network and the league office." 
</P>
<P>
George stressed defense. George always stresses defense. The team not only went 
on two-a-days (practices) but three-a-days. It was vintage Allen. Deacon Jones, 
Merlin Olsen, Ron McDole, Billy Kilmer would have understood perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
George fanned out. He went to the stockyards, he went to service club 
luncheons, he sold season tickets, he led cheers at the Boys Club. He wore a 
cap with the Allen slogan "110%" emblazoned on it. 
</P>
<P>
He was in his 70s? He jogged three miles every morning. He ran up the stadium 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood would love the ending. Little Morningside (enrollment: 1200) won the 
football game, 31-13, its first victory in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The special teams blocked a punt and the defense forced five turnovers, three 
fumble recoveries and two interceptions. You didn't need to see the coach 
wiping his lips to know this was a George Allen game. 
</P>
<P>
George Allen felt as if he had just beaten the Dallas Cowboys for the 
conference championship. "It was 'Field of Dreams' and 'One Second to Play' 
rolled into one," he glowed. Forty-one years rolled away in one afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
George signed with Morningside originally after sending out (by actual count) 
829 letters requesting employment. He got two responses, one from Trinity 
College in Hartford, Conn., and one from Morningside. His salary was $3,900. A 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside won its second game as well (against Southwest Minnesota State, 
21-13), but, by then, Allen was on a plane back to his permanent post as 
chairman of the National Fitness Foundation, another job he takes with sleeves 
rolled up and hands clapping. He is currently preparing for the 90-nation First 
World Congress on Fitness, Nutrition and Sports next May in Chicago, a program 
for which he is the originator. 
</P>
<P>
George was not surprised his team won. His original Morningside team won its 
opener, too, in 1948, 33-0. His professional teams won their openers 13 out of 
his 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Allen subscribed to the Dizzy Dean theory that you can't win them all if you 
don't win the first one. Allen always proposes to win them all, exhibitions, 
playoffs, Bowls -- or home openers in Division III in Sioux City. 
</P>
<P>
George Allen never had a losing season in 14 years in the NFL, won five 
divisional championships, made seven playoffs and one Super Bowl, and his teams 
never finished lower than third with seven firsts, five seconds and two thirds. 
</P>
<P>
That's like a .360 hitter not getting into the Hall of Fame. He makes the Sioux 
City Hall anyway. It's doubtful if any other coach will ever win his home 
openers there 41 years apart.

SAINTS' JACKSON HAS SURGERY, OUT AT LEAST 4 WEEKS

New Orleans Saints linebacker Rickey Jackson underwent 3 1/2 hours of 
reconstructive surgery Thursday on the cheekbone he fractured in a car wreck, 
and a team spokesman said he is expected to be out at least four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson narrowly escaped death early Monday when he drove a borrowed Corvette 
under the back of a flatbed truck on U.S. 61 about three miles from his home 
north of New Orleans. Investigators said he was going more than 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The official police report, issued Thursday, said there was no evidence Jackson 
had been drinking. He was charged with reckless operation of a motor vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Dept. said the truck was going 
about 45 m.p.h. when struck from behind by Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The impact flipped the truck, which landed on its wheels. Neither the driver of 
the truck nor a passenger were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
The Corvette could still be driven, the sheriff spokesman said, and Jackson, 
who was alone, went down the highway to a shopping center to telephone police. 
However, before he could call 911, a deputy saw the car and stopped.

Washington State junior running back Rich Swinton, who is serving two years' 
probation for a misdemeanor assault, was suspended from the team indefinitely 
after being cited last week for driving with a suspended license and without 
Washington plates. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, Washington State University football players would not be suspended 
for a traffic violation," Coach Mike Price said in a prepared statment. "Rich's 
problems have been unique and I find it imperative to discipline him now."

Former Tennessee quarterback Tony Robinson was ordered to serve the remainder 
of his six-year prison sentence on drug charges after a judge said Robinson had 
shown a complete disregard for authority by continuing to use cocaine and 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, 25, admitted he twice tested positive for cocaine while on probation, 
the reason the state sought in May to revoke his probation. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson also admitted he left the state without contacting his probation 
officer to play semi-pro football in Virginia, according to Kim Tolleson, his 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ray Jenkins of the Knox County Criminal Court in Knoxville, Tenn., 
revoked Robinson's probation, telling the former player he had disappointed 
everyone who had tried to help him.

FLORIDA ATHLETICS PROBABLY WON'T FACE 'DEATH PENALTY' 
</P>

Unless a major infraction is found against the University of Florida by 
January, there would be no automatic death penalty for the Gators' athletic 
programs, a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it's not guaranteed there is a case," said David Berst, 
assistant executive director for enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to find a major violation and process it before January of 1990," he 
said, adding that it's unlikely the NCAA could close a case in less than four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to say whether the NCAA has even launched an official investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"In this instance I'm not going to say anything because the thrust of it is the 
release of grand jury testimony," Berst said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that investigators are aware of testimony from Florida athletes 
who said they received money from members of the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Under legislation passed in June, 1985, programs found in violation of NCAA 
rules twice during a five-year span automatically qualify for the death penalty 
-- a one- or two-year suspension of the program. The Florida football program 
was placed on probation in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"That's simply the way the rule works," Berst said. 
</P>
<P>
Florida has received no notification of an NCAA investigation, according to 
Linda Gray, assistant vice president for university relations. However, 
university general counsel Pamela Bernard has talked with NCAA representatives 
about the athletic program, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a judge postponed until Oct. 26 the trial of four South Florida 
sports agents charged with defrauding the university, the Internal Revenue 
Service and the U.S. Department of Education by making secret payments to 
college athletes. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Maurice Paul granted a defense request for a delay during a 
closed hearing Wednesday. The agents had been scheduled for trial Monday on 
charges of racketeering, conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud and income-tax 
charges growing out of the grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys said they needed more time to prepare for trial because of a 
superseding indictment issued last week that added the IRS and the Education 
Department to the case. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement came after a motion filed Tuesday by defense attorneys 
revealing sworn grand jury testimony from former athletes who said they 
received money from Gators' coaches, boosters and recruiters while maintaining 
collegiate eligibility in violation of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball Coach Norm Sloan and football Coach Galen Hall denied allegations 
that they provided cash to school athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Former Florida standout Vernon Maxwell, now with the National Basketball 
Assn.'s San Antonio Spurs, and former linebackers Clifford Charlton and Ron 
Moten told a grand jury investigating alleged drug use at the school that 
coaches broke NCAA rules by paying them cash during their playing days. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell was quoted as saying he used some of the money to buy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the series of motions being filed by the counsel for the 
defense," said Bill Arnsparger, Florida athletic director. "The university is 
studying the material and will be prepared to make the decisions that might be 
necessary when the facts are clearer. . . . I don't believe in speculating." 
</P>
<P>
If Florida is found guilty of a major violation after January, the Gators could 
be hit with the death penalty in any subsequent appearance before the Committee 
on Infractions.

USC ALL-AMERICAN CLEVELAND COLTER TO START OUT ON BENCH AGAINST UTAH STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the cover of the USC media guide are photos of the team's three returning 
All-Americans -- safeties Cleveland Colter and Mark Carrier, and lineman Tim 
Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Coach Larry Smith put an X through one of those photos. 
</P>
<P>
He benched Colter. 
</P>
<P>
For Saturday night's game at the Coliseum against Utah State, Marcus Hopkins 
has replaced Colter in the starting spot at strong safety. Colter will 
certainly play, and he may well be back in the starting lineup for Ohio State a 
week from Saturday. But for now he's not a starter. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year's All-Americans don't count this year," said Smith, citing four 
missed tackles by Colter against Illinois in the season opener, including one 
on receiver Shawn Wax, who was en route to the first of the Fighting Illini's 
two touchdowns in their 14-13 come-from-behind victory. 
</P>
<P>
One theory is that this is nothing more than a kick in the pants for Colter, a 
move to fire him up for the meat of the schedule by sitting him down against an 
opponent USC figures to blow out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a touchy situation," secondary Coach Bobby April said. "When you demote 
just one guy in the secondary after a loss, it obviously looks like the guy 
needs to be shown a lesson. But I don't think that's the reason. If we just 
wanted to get Cleveland ready for Ohio State, we would get him as many plays as 
we could against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I think the reason is just that Marcus played well against Illinois. 
That's all." 
</P>
<P>
That he did. Hopkins not only performed excellently in the secondary, but also 
scored USC's only touchdown on a blocked punt. 
</P>
<P>
What he remembers, though, is the touchdown he didn't score, because he keeps 
hearing about it from teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins was camped on the Illinois five-yard line, his eyes focused on running 
back Luke Petraitis. Quarterback Jeff George, stuck in the end zone, lofted a 
pass toward Petraitis. But he lofted it too far, the ball sailing over 
Petraitis directly at Hopkins. The defensive back, anticipating that Petraitis 
would make the catch, was so intent on hitting him that he never saw the 
football. It hit Hopkins in the face mask and dropped harmlessly to the grass, 
a sure touchdown lost. 
</P>
<P>
So Hopkins has been hearing stuff like: "You need to eat your carrots because 
you're going blind," or "What do you need? Contacts? Glasses?" 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins can smile now, but Smith has lobbed another opportunity in his 
direction, and he says he doesn't intend to let this one get away. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great," Hopkins said of his starting assignment. "I worked hard. I feel 
I improved drastically from spring ball. I feel more comfortable on my reads 
and my decision making is excellent. Whatever the coach decides, I'm all for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
But while he's thrilled, Hopkins is certainly cognizant of the situation. "I 
think it's awkward," April said. "It's tough on Cleveland. I think Marcus is 
very aware that Cleveland is the guy. I think behind me, and Colter and his 
family, nobody is pulling harder for Cleveland than Marcus. But once he gets on 
the field, he is going to take advantage of his situation." 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins said he was surprised by the promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to be in this position," he said, "although I worked hard and 
it's what I wanted to do. I feel honored to be doing it because he (Colter) is 
an All-American and he's known nationwide as being one of the top safeties in 
America. For me to even jeopardize his position is an honor. If I can make him 
a better player because he is threatened by my beating him out, that's good." 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins is used to battling his way out from behind big shadows. After all, he 
went to Lincoln High School in San Diego. And whenever you mention football at 
Lincoln, people almost always bring up Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
Uh, not that exactly that Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
Long before Marcus Hopkins enrolled there, Marcus Allen was a star at Lincoln. 
But Hopkins found his own spotlight at the school, playing everything from 
running back to wide receiver to tight end to linebacker to defensive back. He 
had no choice. There were only 22 kids on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lincoln won the CIF San Diego Section 2-A title in both 1985 and 
'86. In '86, Hopkins earned All-State honors along with his school's Marcus 
Allen Perpetual Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins continued to emulate the other Marcus by becoming a Trojan, although 
that wasn't his original game plan. He wasn't interested in going to a school 
already loaded at tailback, and USC wasn't particularly interested in him. But 
Smith, then the coach at Arizona, liked Hopkins. And kept in touch when he took 
the job at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins spent 1987, his first season as a Trojan, as a reserve tailback. He was 
switched to receiver in spring ball, then to defensive back. When Colter was 
hampered by a knee injury this past spring, Hopkins took his spot. 
</P>
<P>
Just as he'll do Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
A big help in Hopkins' transition to the secondary is the presence in the USC 
defensive backfield of another All-American, Mark Carrier. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I'm so hyped just to be there," Hopkins said. "I want to do so well 
that my emotions overtake my physical skills. I look for him (Carrier) and he 
settles me down all the time. He's always on my case, which I need right now."

1992 ALL-STAR GAME AWARDED TO SAN DIEGO

<P>
The 1992 All-Star game will be played at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, 
National League President Bill White said Thursday after a meeting of 
baseball's executive council in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, which last played host to the All-Star game in 1978, beat out 
Houston, Montreal and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego business and community leaders made a presentation last June in 
Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
"We owe a real vote of thanks to the city and community officials who joined 
with us in putting together an outstanding bid," Padre president Dick Freeman 
said. "We were in tough competition." 
</P>
<P>
In other action, owners unanimously approved the sale of the Seattle Mariners 
to a group of investors headed by Indianapolis businessmen Jeff Smulyan and 
Michael Browning, who promised not to move the team. 
</P>
<P>
Smulyan and Browning purchased the Mariners from George Argyros, who bought the 
team in 1981 for $13.1 million. The team was appraised at $76.1 million in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Newly elected Commissioner Fay Vincent said baseball had the assurances of 
Smulyan and Browning that they would not move the Mariners out of Seattle, 
which already has lost one baseball team. The former Seattle Pilots played the 
1969 season in Seattle before moving to Milwaukee and becoming the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question these two fellows love baseball and they made the 
commitment to me they will do everything in their considerable power to make 
Seattle a more successful franchise," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
Smulyan, 42, is head of Emmis Broadcasting Corp., the largest privately owned 
radio station chain in the country. Browning, 41, is president of Browning 
Investments, a real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
Upon leaving Thursday's meeting, Argyros declined comment. He was not popular 
in Seattle and often battled local officials over his lease and the Mariners' 
lack of success. 
</P>
<P>
A. Bartlett Giamatti will be honored by baseball on Oct. 31 at a memorial in 
New York's Carnegie Hall, and the World Series will be played in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, who died of a heart attack Sept. 1 after five months as commissioner, 
had a private funeral at the request of his family.

Commissioner Fay Vincent said the service in the 2,800-seat hall would be by 
invitation only. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent spoke of his predecessor Thursday during the major league owners' 
quarterly meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I started the meeting, obviously, with a tribute to Bart," Vincent said. "I 
had written an essay about him and read the essay. I reminded the ownership 
that it was our judgment that the World Series should be dedicated to Bart. We 
obviously will be using the ball that has his signature. The players will be 
wearing black armbands. The umpires will wear suitable patches. The flags will 
fly at half staff. The World Series program will be dedicated to Bart and we 
will reprint in there that wonderful essay 'Green Fields of the Mind.' " 
</P>
<P>
Former Brooklyn Dodger pitcher Joe Black was appointed special consultant to 
the commissioner for player personal development. Black will help players 
adjust to their retirements, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to make players aware that baseball is only one phase of their 
lives," Black said. "I hope I can make a difference by helping players prepare 
for long, productive and decent lives once their playing careers are 
concluded." 
</P>
<P>
Black, the 1952 National League rookie of the year, recently retired as senior 
vice president for urban affairs of Greyhound Corp. and is president of JayBee 
&amp; Associates in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer owner Bud Selig was presented the August A. Busch Jr. Award for long and 
meritorious service to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The award was presented previously to Walter O'Malley of the Dodgers, John 
Galbreath of the Pirates, John Fetzer of the Tigers, and Lee MacPhail of the 
American League and Chub Feeney of the National League.

JUNK BOND SCARE MAKES INVESTORS MORE CAUTIOUS; 
</P>
<P>
MANY WONDER IF INCREASING DEBT BURDEN IS HURTING FIRMS' ABILITY TO COMPETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Although price declines for high-yield junk bonds subsided Thursday after a 
violent selloff the day before, this week's rout shows that the $200-billion 
junk market has entered a new era of increasing risk and volatility, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, investors have become much more picky about which junk issues they 
will buy, and they are demanding higher yields over safer Treasury securities 
to justify the risks. The "spread" between junk bond yields and those on 
Treasuries has widened to well over 5 percentage points, compared to 4.2 points 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The more of these types of scares that we have, the more cautious investors 
are going to be," said Michael Singer, director of research at R. D. Smith 
&amp; Co., a New York firm that specializes in securities of troubled 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, investors are no longer worried just about a possible recession 
and how that would depress the profits of junk bond issuers. They are also 
worried about the increasing debt burdens that many issuers have taken on, and 
how those borrowings are impairing these companies' ability to compete even 
without a recession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Market Share Lost 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, investors are increasingly wary of junk bonds from issuers such as 
retailing giant Campeau Corp., which must rely on asset sales and optimistic 
revenue increases to pay interest on those bonds. Campeau's disclosure this 
week that it faces a cash crunch, due in part to disappointing sales growth and 
other woes, set its Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores bonds 
plummeting Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of bonds of other retailers, as well as health-care and financial 
services firms, have also been hit hard, analyst Singer said. Investors fear 
that their asset sales and cash flows will be inadequate. Meanwhile, some are 
losing market share to rivals with less debt that are better able to finance 
expansions and other competitive moves. 
</P>
<P>
"With these difficulties now, who knows what will happen when a recession 
finally hits," said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service, 
a chief bond rating firm. "You've really never experienced a recession with 
your corporate sector as leveraged as it is today." 
</P>
<P>
The junk bond worries have also added a sharp dose of caution to the market for 
leveraged buyouts. Several troubled junk bond issuers, including Campeau, 
boosted their debts through junk bonds used to finance LBOs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Starting to Collapse' 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts also contend that the market is less stable because of the 
absence of former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond chief Michael Milken, who 
resigned under terms of Drexel's guilty plea to securities law violations. 
</P>
<P>
"Milken used to dress up troubled issues, restructuring and refinancing them so 
that everyone went away happy," said C. Richard Lehmann, president of the Bond 
Investors Assn. in Miami Lakes, Fla. "Since Milken stepped away, there's been 
no one there to hold the house of cards together, and it's starting to 
collapse." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, investors have some justifications for their belief that the stakes are 
higher in junk bonds. The default rate on junk bonds so far this year has 
nearly doubled last year's pace. About $8.3 billion worth of junk bonds have 
defaulted this year, versus $4.8 billion for all of last year, according to the 
Bond Investors Assn. That represents a default rate of more than 4%, compared 
to 2% to 3% before, Lehmann said. 
</P>
<P>
"Junk bonds are beginning to earn their name," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the biggest junk defaults this year are issues of American Continental, 
parent of failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine; Southmark, a giant 
Dallas-based limited partnership syndicator; Integrated Resources, a New York 
financial services concern; Resorts International, the hotel and casino company 
acquired by entertainer Merv Griffin, and Eastern Airlines, attempting to 
reorganize through federal bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yielded as Much as 25% 
</P>
<P>
Further, some of the more recent defaults have occurred within a year of the 
bonds being issued, and in some cases even before the first interest payment 
was due, Lehmann said. Such were the cases with recent junk bonds issued by New 
York retailer Crazy Eddie, Resorts International, Residential Resources and 
Multimedia, Lehmann said. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's market action, prices for bonds of Allied Stores and Federated 
Department Stores fell again sharply as investors continued to reel from news 
of Campeau's cash squeeze. A key Federated junk bond fell about 8 points, or 
$80 for each $1,000 in face value, while the most widely watched Allied junk 
issue fell about 10 points, one analyst said. The sharp decline meant that the 
Allied bond yielded as much as 25%, since yields rise when bond prices fall. 
</P>
<P>
News of their declines helped spark greater outflows of money from at least 
some mutual funds investing in junk bonds. Steven E. Norwitz, spokesman for the 
T. Rowe Price mutual fund group in Baltimore, said outflows of funds from its 
high-yield fund were "well above average" Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the declines in the Allied and Federated bonds did not trigger sharp 
declines in other junk issues Thursday, as they did Wednesday. Junk issues 
generally fell between 1/2 to 1 points in slow activity, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was not the same panic atmosphere as yesterday," said James Spirrison, 
senior vice president at Rodman &amp; Renshaw, a Chicago brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the vast majority of junk issues still remain in good shape, and 
there was nothing in the news this week to change the financial conditions or 
prospects of their issuers. Further, this week's market selloff could very well 
have been overdone, leading to a surge of buying by bargain hunters attracted 
by low prices and higher spreads over Treasuries, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have to Be 'Selective' 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible we will see some of these issues bounce back," Moody's Lonski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as you're selective, there are a lot of good companies issuing junk 
bonds," said Daniel Smith, portfolio manager for the Van Kampen Merritt 
Corporate High-Yield mutual fund, which was buying junk issues selectively on 
Thursday. "These will continue to be viable markets; they've just gotten a lot 
of bad press recently." 
</P>
<P>
But more redemptions by investors in junk bond mutual funds could cause further 
selloffs by forcing those fund managers to unload bonds to pay off investors, 
Spirrison said. Continued declines might also discourage companies from issuing 
new junk bonds, he added.

3 INDICTED FOR ALLEGED SCHEME TO BUY 11 S&amp;LS; 
</P>
<P>
AIDE TO FORMER SENATOR AND 2 BUSINESSMEN ACCUSED OF BRIBERY, CONSPIRACY, 
RACKETEERING

Glen N. Mauldin, administrative assistant to former Sen. Chic Hecht (R-Nev.), 
has been indicted in Texas along with two businessmen on charges of bribery, 
conspiracy and racketeering in an alleged scheme to acquire 11 savings and loan 
institutions, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Mauldin, who denied any wrongdoing, was named in a 22-count federal indictment 
unsealed in San Antonio that also charged the defendants with seeking to use 
Hecht's office to further their investment plans on the island of Grenada. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Jahn, an assistant U.S. attorney, said Mauldin, Washington lobbyist Vincent 
P. Lachelli and Houston businessman Darrell A. Tomblin were charged with 
corruptly promising Mauldin a 10% interest in their venture in return for his 
assistance in getting the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to approve acquisition 
by Tomblin's group of 11 thrifts in Texas and other states that were "in poor 
economic condition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hecht Not Charged 
</P>
<P>
The plans did not reach completion, authorities said, and none of the 
institutions was actually acquired. The identity of only one of them was 
disclosed -- Suburban Savings &amp; Loan of San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth defendant, financial consultant William Murray Abroms of New Orleans, 
was charged with five counts of perjury on grounds he lied to grand jurors 
about the activities of the other three men. 
</P>
<P>
Abroms was identified as a longtime associate of Tomblin. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Eversberg, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas, said Hecht 
"is not charged in the indictment and has cooperated with the FBI." 
</P>
<P>
Hecht, defeated in his Senate race last fall, has been named by President Bush 
as ambassador to the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
Mauldin, aside from serving as Hecht's administrative assistant, also was 
campaign treasurer of Hecht's reelection committee, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Eversberg said Tomblin, who was also charged with extorting $250,000 from 
Suburban Savings of San Antonio, "made an application for control of this 
savings institution and others, and Mr. Mauldin was going to use his influence 
with the bank board to help accomplish it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Year-Long Investigation 
</P>
<P>
The offenses charged in the indictment occurred between November, 1987, and 
November, 1988, Jahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the indictments follow a year-long investigation by FBI 
agents, federal prosecutors in San Antonio and Tampa, Fla., and attorneys from 
the Justice Department's public integrity section in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Mauldin, Lachelli and Tomblin were also charged in the indictment with seeking 
to engage in the petroleum and fishing business on the island of Grenada 
through the use of "corruptly obtained political influence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grenadan Officials Helped 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, the defendants "would and did utilize the 
corruptly obtained influence of the office of a United States senator to obtain 
concessions from the government of Grenada, financing in the form of loans and 
grants and the intervention of various agencies of the United States . . . to 
further the defendants' business plans." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment said Mauldin obtained a letter on Hecht's official stationery 
"introducing the conspirators to the prime minister of Grenada and endorsing 
their business plans." 
</P>
<P>
Eversberg said Grenadan officials assisted the FBI in bringing this aspect of 
the investigation "to its logical conclusion."

BRITISH PETROLEUM TO SELL SOME ASSETS, CUT JOBS; 
</P>
<P>
RESTRUCTURING ANNOUNCEMENT FUELS SPECULATION BP WILL BID FOR UNOCAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
British Petroleum Co. said Thursday that it will sell a small part of its oil 
and gas properties for $1.3 billion and is eliminating 1,700 jobs in a major 
reorganization designed to reduce costs and put more emphasis on exploration. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the streamlining would reduce overhead costs by more than $150 
million a year. "The rapid growth of the business in the past three years has 
prompted us to examine our current shape to make sure it keeps us competitive 
in a harsher business climate," John Browne, the chief executive, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renewed Speculation 
</P>
<P>
The sale of assets to Dallas-based Oryx Energy Co. and the reorganization 
renewed speculation, however, that BP is positioning itself to make a major 
acquisition in the United States, most likely Los Angeles-based Unocal Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"What (BP) lacks is the representation in refining and marketing in the U.S., 
particularly on the West Coast," said Donald L. Fernow, a New York-based 
independent oil analyst. Strategically, Unocal fits BP's needs, analysts said. 
Although it is not the only U.S. oil concern that would fit, "Unocal is of a 
size that (BP) could easily digest," Fernow said. 
</P>
<P>
BP officials have said they want a greater presence in the United States. The 
sale would provide BP with the cash to make an acquisition or to reduce its 
debt, which deepened earlier this year when BP borrowed $4.2 billion to 
repurchase some of its stock from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal's share price fell Thursday, mainly from anticipation that BP was about 
to announce an acquisition bid. BP said it had no immediate plan for a U.S. 
acquisition. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Unocal closed 
at $54.50, down $1.625. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, speculation persisted that BP eventually will make a move. The 
company operates about half the fields of Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and needs West 
Coast refining capacity to save the cost of shipping crude to Gulf Coast 
refineries via the Panama Canal, said Greg Schwerdt, an analyst with Seidler 
Amdec Securities of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Unocal has refineries and marketing on the West Coast, so an acquisition of 
Unocal makes a large degree of economic sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Analysts Disagree 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said Unocal would meet BP's desire for a natural gas acquisition 
in the United States and for additional Gulf Coast exploration properties. 
Unocal officials would not comment on the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Not all analysts believed that the Oryx deal was a prelude to a BP acquisition. 
"I don't believe the two events are necessarily related," said Bernard J. 
Picchi, an analyst with Salomon Bros. in New York. "I feel it's a decision 
independent of what they do with the cash, a prudent business decision by BP to 
cut back on their higher-cost assets," Picchi said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oryx purchase includes a small portion of North Sea reserves and interests 
in Indonesia, Dubai, Ecuador, Colombia, Gabon and Italy. Oryx, formerly Sun 
Exploration and Production Co., which was spun off last year from Sun Oil Co., 
said the additions will increase its size by a third. "This is very significant 
to us," said Oryx spokesman Tom Sullivan. "It fulfills our desire . . . to get 
back into the international arena." 
</P>
<P>
The reorganized BP will have three regional operating companies, an 
international technology division and a global gas unit, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
BP has about 126,000 employees worldwide. It said it plans to eliminate about 
280 jobs at the Houston office, and expects to take a charge against earnings 
of more than $100 million from the job reductions, which it said will come 
mainly from early retirements and voluntary severance agreements.

Maxicare Patients Won't Be Billed: Maxicare Health Plans said the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana has issued a preliminary injunction preventing 
health-care providers from billing patients for bills that the Los 
Angeles-based health-maintenance organization owes. Maxicare filed for 
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 
March, suspending payments to providers for bills incurred before the filing.

Nu-Med Inc.: The Encino-based health-care firm, which has sold several of its 
hospitals and reduced its debt over the last few years, said its continuing 
operations have returned to profitability in the first quarter after a $376,000 
loss a year ago. Due to a $4.2-million one-time gain realized in the 1988 
quarter, however, net income dropped 78% to $1.04 million. Revenue rose 15% in 
the quarter to $73.9 million.

Money Supply Expands: The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply 
rose in the week ended Sept. 4, the Federal Reserve Board said. The measure 
known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $3,140.6 billion from a revised 
$3,138.0 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a 
seasonally adjusted $4,007.3 billion from $4,006.3 billion. The narrowest 
measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $774.7 billion 
from $777.4 billion.

WPPSS Board OKs Bond Sale: The sale of $721.4 million in refinancing bonds for 
two nuclear reactors will mark the Washington Public Power Supply System's 
return to the markets after its historic $2.25-billion bond default six years 
ago. The total value of the sale is considerably more than the $450 million 
that WPPSS had initially planned to put on the market, reflecting enthusiasm 
among investors for the terms offered in order to refinance construction bonds 
sold in the late 1970s and early 1980s to build WPPSS plants Nos. 1 and 3. 
WPPSS is offering a variety of yields; the bonds are rated AA by Standard &amp; 
Poor's Corp. and A by Moody's Investors Service Inc.

CHOICE FOR SEC CHIEF SAILS THROUGH HEARING

Richard C. Breeden, President Bush's choice to head the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, said at his confirmation hearing Thursday that he would vigorously 
enforce existing regulations because they are vital to preserving investor 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Greeted with wary cordiality by regulation-hungry Democrats on the Senate 
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Breeden hinted that he would seek 
a vigorous SEC role in creating and updating regulatory policy. He 
enthusiastically backed suggestions that SEC staff salaries be increased to 
retain staff veterans. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Breeden carefully avoided telling committee Democrats 
anything that he knew they did not want to hear. Although he is an ardent 
free-market advocate, he carefully promised "free and open debate" on proposals 
for increased regulation of future takeovers and high-debt corporate buyouts if 
he is confirmed as the top federal overseer of the nation's securities trading. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Breeden worked closely with the committee as the White House 
point man in hammering out the complex savings and loan bailout package. When 
the 39-year-old Breeden, a Manhattan Beach native, was nominated last month, 
committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) had questioned his ability, 
saying that Breeden "brings a limited direct market experience to this critical 
assignment and that is a matter of some concern when the SEC faces a time of 
epic challenge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Was Well Prepared 
</P>
<P>
Some observers expected Breeden to face tough questioning about his experience, 
but little of that distrust surfaced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Known as a quick study, Breeden had made the rounds of committee members 
earlier in the week, chatting at length and hearing their concerns. Thus he was 
well prepared for the tendency of some committee members to look to strict 
regulation and even criminal prosecution as a protection against market 
excesses of the kind that led to the 1987 crash. 
</P>
<P>
Questions from Democrats Riegle, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Terry 
Sanford of North Carolina were not adversarial, even though all three knew that 
Breeden, a staunch advocate of deregulation, disagreed with many of their 
views. After a hearing of barely three hours, Riegle declared his support and 
said he intended to report the nomination to the full Senate for action as 
quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd asked Breeden to endorse the sweeping criminal prosecution of insider 
abuses that has put traders such as Ivan F. Boesky in jail and thrown junk bond 
innovator Michael Milken under a dark legal cloud. Breeden replied that, 
subject to "careful prosecutorial discretion . . . the potential of criminal 
sanctions is a helpful adjunct to the civil enforcement program" that is the 
prime responsibility of the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Clean Market 
</P>
<P>
He added, "Free markets don't work if investors believe markets are dominated 
by fraud and corruption." In the same vein, he assured Riegle that he would be, 
in Riegle's words, a "fair but tough cop." 
</P>
<P>
"I am a strong believer in the free market . . . but that does not need to 
connote tolerance of fraud," Breeden said. "To achieve the result of a clean 
market, (you need) an element of predictability in the law and the 
understanding that it will be vigorously enforced." 
</P>
<P>
That reply included a strong hint that Breeden favors clarifying such murky 
concepts as insider trading so that traders can know exactly where the line is 
before they can be accused of transgressing it. Some prosecutors have preferred 
leaving the law murky on this point to avoid giving possible targets a "road 
map" for staying within the law. 
</P>
<P>
At another point in the hearing, Breeden said the SEC needs to modernize its 
statutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Markets have changed enormously and that requires a willingness by the 
commission to look afresh. It has to be willing to rethink issues," he said. 
Asked how to avert a replay of the 1987 crash, Breeden said he would encourage 
top-level staff exchanges to encourage cooperation between the SEC and the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is charged with regulating the 
futures market.

SOME COMPANIES OPEN FULL-SERVICE CLINICS TO SAVE ON HEALTH-CARE COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALBERT B. CRENSHAW, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rising cost of health care is driving some companies back to the future. 
</P>
<P>
They are reviving the old idea of the company doctor. 
</P>
<P>
But these firms, which include some of the nation's oldest, such as Goodyear 
Tire &amp; Rubber Co., and some of its newest, such as America West Airlines 
Inc., are doing it in modern form. 
</P>
<P>
The companies are setting up their own fully equipped clinics, staffed by 
doctors, technicians and other support people whose full-time jobs are to 
provide care for employees and sometimes for retirees and dependents. The 
benefit to companies: It's cheaper than having their workers obtain the 
services on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
In their more advanced form, such clinics offer a wide range of medical 
services, including laboratory tests, X-rays and diagnostic procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Goodyear's facilities, for example, are "every bit as sophisticated as any 
general family-practice clinic in any country," a company spokesman said. The 
clinics are popular and convenient and save the company a lot of money, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Medical-care costs, which have been rising at double-digit rates for years, are 
causing both employers and employees to explore every avenue to ease the 
burden. Some employers are trying to shift more of the cost to employees; 
others are pressing to use health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or 
contracting for discount prices with doctors and hospitals as preferred 
provider organizations (PPOs). 
</P>
<P>
Still others are turning to the government in hopes that it will either pick up 
a larger share of the costs or impose some form of nationwide cost control. 
</P>
<P>
The number of companies running their own clinics is still very small. Some 
critics see the potential for conflicts of interest, while others wonder 
whether companies really will benefit from getting into the health-care 
business. 
</P>
<P>
But such skepticism hasn't detracted from the efforts of companies such as 
Southern California Edison Co. and Gillette Co., which have been running 
in-house clinics for many years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's enormously cost-effective," said Thomas R. Burke, former chief of staff 
at the Department of Health and Human Services and now a consultant with A. 
Foster Higgins &amp; Co. here. 
</P>
<P>
In Burke's view, the current system of medical care contains incentives for 
doctors and hospitals to raise costs rather than lower them, and until these 
incentives are removed, costs will continue to spiral upward. Putting doctors 
on salary, as these clinics commonly do, accomplishes that. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers supplied by some of the companies operating clinics support his thesis. 
</P>
<P>
Goodyear, which started its first clinic at its Lawton, Okla., tire plant in 
1984 and has since opened facilities in Gadsden, Ala., and Akron, Ohio, charges 
$15 for an office visit. This fee includes most diagnostic tests and any drugs 
prescribed; X-rays are $3 extra. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic is open to employees, dependents and retirees, a population of 
eligibles that now totals more than 50,000. The Lawton and Gadsden plants have 
been saving the company more than $400,000 a year between them, and the plant 
in Akron, where 30,000 Goodyear workers and retirees reside, is expected to 
save about $800,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
America West, a 6-year-old airline based in Phoenix, began with one doctor at a 
downtown location in 1987 and has since added two more doctors and moved the 
clinic into leased quarters at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I've used it," said Dick Shimizu, America West's manager of media relations. 
He said he went in with a sore throat, was examined by a physician and got a 
prescription filled, "and the whole thing was $11." 
</P>
<P>
America West has 6,500 employees in Phoenix out of a total of 11,000, but the 
set-up is so popular that some of those located elsewhere fly in to use it, 
Shimizu said. This is true even though America West, like Goodyear, makes no 
effort to compel employees to use the clinic. They are free to choose their own 
physicians and a conventional insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
At America West, only employees are eligible now, Shimizu said, but the company 
is studying expanding the service to dependents. 
</P>
<P>
Gillette, which has operated clinics since 1950, figures that they save the 
company about $1 million out of a total health-care tab of about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies are exploring the clinic option, but they are not so sure about 
the economics. 
</P>
<P>
"It allegedly saves us money," said an official of General Electric, which is 
offering employees at certain plants some routine care on an experimental 
basis. But GE's is still just a supplement to its regular health insurance 
program and it has not yet proven that it is worthwhile, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Health-care experts generally agree that several factors are likely to limit 
the ultimate savings that in-house corporate medicine can achieve. 
</P>
<P>
First, only employers with large concentrations of employees in one area can 
make the system work. And because even those firms usually have workers 
scattered elsewhere, they must continue to offer conventional insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Second, unless corporations are prepared to go into the hospital business, this 
system will not provide savings for the extremely ill -- who account for the 
majority of medical costs at most companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethical Concerns Cited 
</P>
<P>
As with PPOs and other cost-containment devices, "I think the book is out on 
all of that," said Michael B. Jones of Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting 
firm. "I think what's encouraging is that companies have the guts to take a 
stand, to take the risks of pioneering efforts to find out what does work." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, some critics who remember the old-style company doctor -- the one who 
was unable to detect black lung, brown lung, silicosis or various chemical 
poisonings that an employee might have contracted on the job -- worry about 
what a doctor in a company-sponsored clinic might do if he or she encountered a 
condition that would cost the company a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, there are questions about how seriously a company doctor might take 
complaints about potential harm from the workplace environment or equipment, 
especially if there is scientific debate on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had such bad experience in the past," said Karen Ignagni of the AFL-CIO, 
that many workers remain highly suspicious of the concept. 
</P>
<P>
The Goodyear spokesman noted that the company contracts with an outside firm 
for its medical staffs and that "the employee or retiree knows the company does 
not run the facility." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Options Cost More 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best example of how in-house corporate medicine might evolve can be 
seen at Southern California Edison. Begun 86 years ago as a way of providing 
care for workers at remote construction sites, the giant utility's clinic 
system rivals that of a major hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real medical center," handling 100,000 patient visits a year and 
dispensing 250,000 prescriptions, said Dr. Jacque J. Sokolov, the company's 
medical director. Edison employs 14 doctors and contracts with other 
specialists, such as obstetricians, dermatologists and orthopedic surgeons, who 
come to the 10 clinics on a rotating basis. 
</P>
<P>
The company is in the process of obtaining formal certification, like that of 
any other large hospital or clinic, that will assure patients that the staff 
meets standards of professional peer review, medical education and the like. 
</P>
<P>
All of the company's 57,000 employees, dependents and retirees may either use 
the clinic or opt for conventional coverage -- for a higher price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doctors Autonomous 
</P>
<P>
The Edison clinics are fully capable of handling most catastrophic illnesses, 
Sokolov said. In fact, "that's where we shine," he said, because the clinics 
offer not only treatment but case management and follow-up to assure the 
patient the best care at the lowest cost. 
</P>
<P>
"When a physician identifies an individual who needs catastrophic care, we have 
it right here and that does save significant amounts of money," Sokolov said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that "whenever you have a situation where a company is 
providing service for the employee, there is always the potential for conflict 
of interest. But our physicians are essentially autonomous (and) responsible to 
the standards of their individual profession. They are quality physicians who 
could be working anywhere.

EX-CEO PLEADS GUILTY IN PLOT TO SELL ASHLAND OIL SECRETS

Orin Atkins, the former chairman and chief executive of Ashland Oil Inc., 
pleaded guilty Thursday to charges that he tried to sell confidential company 
documents to an Iranian oil company involved in a dispute with Ashland. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the plea, federal prosecutors said a seven-count indictment was 
brought against an attorney whose firm once worked for Ashland, for his alleged 
role in the scheme in which Atkins pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins, 65, of North Palm Beach, Fla., pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to 
conspiracy and wire fraud. Could face a maximum of 10 years in prison and a 
$500,000 fine when he is sentenced Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins was Ashland's chairman and chief executive from 1974 until 1981. He was 
a consultant to Ashland, earning $425,000 a year, from 1981 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Benito Romano said Atkins and the lawyer, Charles D. Barnett, were 
involved in a secret scheme to defraud Ashland by attempting to sell 
confidential papers to National Iranian Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
The documents dealt with the 1979 sale of $283 million in crude oil from the 
Iranian company to Ashland Overseas Trading Ltd., a Ashland subsidiary in 
Bermuda. Court papers said Ashland never paid for the oil. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, while he was a paid consultant, Atkins received about 260 privileged 
documents about the oil sale through an unidentified Ashland employee, Romano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment against Barnett, Atkins and Barnett made repeated 
attempts, from 1982 until 1988, to sell the documents and Atkins' consulting 
services to the Iranian company. They had planned to use a Swiss bank account 
to receive their payment, it said. 
</P>
<P>
As compensation, Atkins and Barnett asked for 25% of what the Iranian company 
recovered from Ashland, the indictment alleged. 
</P>
<P>
In court Thursday, Atkins said the deal was never final, although 
representatives of the Iranian company were allowed to see the documents in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing the papers, National Iranian Oil Co. sued Ashland and Ashland 
Overseas for payment on the oil. Those suits, filed in Mississippi and Bermuda, 
were settled last week when Ashland agreed to pay $325 million, said Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Herve Gouraige. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Ashland nor National Iranian Oil Co. was charged with any wrongdoing. 
Romano praised Ashland for cooperating in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conspiracy, Fraud Charged 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, 38, of Palm Beach, Fla., was charged with conspiracy and six counts of 
wire fraud. If convicted, he faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on 
each count. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, who is not in custody, was scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 21.

7 ARRESTED AT NYSE IN AIDS DRUG PROTEST

Seven activists protesting the high cost of an AIDS drug Thursday chained 
themselves to a railing at the New York Stock Exchange as the opening bell 
signaled the start of trading but were quickly unshackled and arrested, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The activists, affiliated with the known as ACT-UP, told officials that they 
were protesting the refusal of Burroughs Wellcome Co. to lower the price of 
AZT, a drug used to treat AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The unannounced protest preceded by several hours a planned demonstration 
outside the exchange by the group. A similar action was planned in San 
Francisco, and protests were scheduled in London, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The activists, dressed as floor traders and wearing fake brokerage firm IDs, 
managed somehow to sneak into the exchange building, where security is normally 
tight, and chained themselves to a railing on the administrative platform 
overlooking the trading floor, said exchange spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Over Quick' 
</P>
<P>
"Some people managed to sneak into the building and get up on the 
administrative platform," Gamsin said. 
</P>
<P>
There, they unfurled a banner that read "Sell Wellcome" -- a reference to 
Burroughs Wellcome, manufacturer of AZT -- and set off miniature fog horns. 
</P>
<P>
The protest did not disrupt the functioning of the exchange, said Gamsin, who 
noted that Burroughs Wellcome is traded over the counter, not on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people were somewhat disturbed by it on the trading floor but it did 
not affect the trading or the functioning of the New York Stock Exchange," she 
said. "And it was it very quick, it was over quick." 
</P>
<P>
The seven were arrested and charged with criminal trespass.

DOW FALLS 14 ON EVE OF 'TRIPLE-WITCHING HOUR'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market extended its September slump Thursday in selling blamed on 
takeover debt worries and caution in advance of the quarterly "triple-witching 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, down 27.74 on Wednesday, dropped an 
additional 14.63 to 2,664.89. 
</P>
<P>
In the eight sessions since Labor Day, the index has lost 87.20. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by close to 3 to 1 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 396 up, 1,108 down and 479 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the stock market remained unsettled by recent pressure on the 
market for high-yield junk bonds of companies carrying large debt loads. 
</P>
<P>
The worries focused on the problems of Campeau Corp., which is trying to 
restructure its retailing empire to keep up with its debt obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Woolworth Corp., a retailer that has been widely rumored as a buyout candidate, 
fell 3 1/4 to 64 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Airline stocks, a hot takeover group for most of the summer, also declined 
broadly. AMR lost 4 1/8 to 77 5/8, Delta Air Lines dropped 2 7/8 to 71 5/8, and 
UAL slipped 2 3/4 to 280 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Among other prominent issues recently talked up as potential takeover targets, 
Honeywell fell 2 3/4 to 82 1/2 and Eastman Kodak lost 5/8 to 48 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Some money evidently flowed out of those stocks into blue chips so big that 
they presumably had no takeover premiums built into their prices. American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose 1/4 to 40 1/4, International Business Machines 
added 3/8 to 115 3/4 and General Electric climbed 3/8 to 55 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers also noted that traders were proceeding cautiously before the quarterly 
witching hour today involving a series of expiring stock index options and 
futures. 
</P>
<P>
The government reported Thursday that retail sales increased 0.7% in August, 
slightly below most advance estimates. The news provided some support for U.S. 
Treasury securities, nudging interest rates a bit lower in that sector of the 
credit markets. But stocks got little benefit from those developments. 
</P>
<P>
Circle K Corp. led the NYSE active list, down 3/8 at 7 3/8. The stock fell 1 
3/4 on Wednesday, when the company said it had ended efforts to solicit 
takeover offers and suspended its dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 149.25 million shares, down from 175.33 million 
Wednesday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter 
market, totaled 177.83 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks struggled to modest gains in thin trade as investors stuck to 
the sidelines ahead of U.S. trade and other economic data due out today, 
brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-share Nikkei index climbed 114.94 to close at 34,401.88 after losing 
45.94 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Today is a national holiday in Japan, which is another reason that turnover was 
a thin 550 million shares against 600 million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices closed sharply lower on London's Stock Exchange, depressed by 
early losses on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed at 2,382.0, down 
19.5. It finished at its session low and the market's lowest close since Aug. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Prices of Treasury and most corporate bonds rose, but the junk bond market 
continued to weaken. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of government securities benefited from a report of unexpectedly soft 
retail sales, while the high-yield junk bond market sagged because of the 
financial problems at Campeau Corp.'s retail subsidiaries, Federated Department 
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond recovered 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 
face amount. Its yield declined to 8.12% from 8.14% late Wednesday. The bond 
had lost about $5 per $1,000 in face amount Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bids for Federated and Allied junk bonds dropped, but there was little trading 
because holders of the bonds were unwilling to sell at the rock-bottom prices. 
Dealers said, for example, that Federated's 16% senior subordinated debentures 
due in 2000 were trading at 50, meaning that they had lost half their value 
since issuance. 
</P>
<P>
Federated and Allied disclosed Wednesday that they faced a cash crunch. Most 
junk bonds were down about 1/4 to 1/2 point, said Alan Schlesinger, head of 
junk bond trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8 7/8%, compared to 8-13/16% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rebounded to finish higher in choppy U.S. dealings after closing 
lower overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled 
at $360.50 an ounce, up 60 cents. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of 
$359.35, up from $358.70. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Bank of Japan entered the market overnight to sell a large 
amount of dollars, which pushed the U.S. currency lower overseas. Further, 
dealers in Europe moved to trim their dollar holdings before today's release of 
U.S. merchandise trade figures for July. 
</P>
<P>
But dealers at home used the impending Commerce Department report as a reason 
to buy dollars, pushing the currency higher in a seesaw session. 
</P>

In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.85 Japanese yen, down from 146.70 yen. Later 
in London, the dollar traded lower at 146.60 yen. In New York, the dollar rose 
to close at 146.85 yen, from 146.40 yen Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.5582, up from $1.5530. But in New York, 
one pound cost $1.5540, cheaper than $1.5585 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold closed in London at $362, up from $358.50. The late bid in Zurich, 
Switzerland, was $361.75, up from $358.25. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at 
$359.85, up from $359.60. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Copper for spot delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange surged to a 4 
1/2-month high as the market ignored a mining strike settlement in Chile and 
focused on continuing supply disruptions in other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, pork bellies rose the limit and grain futures rallied on news 
of a food-aid package to Poland; energy futures fell and precious metals were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures settled 1.5 to 4.9 cents higher, with the spot contract, for 
delivery in September, at $1.373 a pound, the highest settlement for spot 
copper contract on the Comex since April 28. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement of a 2-week-old strike at Chilean Copper Co.'s El Salvador mine 
had been expected and caused little market reaction. 
</P>
<P>
New reports regarding U.S. food aid to Poland boosted meat and grain futures in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen pork belly futures have risen for the past two weeks on expectations 
that the government will donate some of the burgeoning U.S. pork belly surplus 
to the Poles. 
</P>
<P>
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, frozen pork bellies settled 1.93 to 2 cents 
higher, with February at 48.25 cents a pound; hog futures were 0.23 to .85 cent 
higher, with October at 40.57 cents a pound; live cattle were 0.07 cent lower 
to 0.50 cent higher, with October at 72.52 cents a pound, and feeder cattle 
were 0.10 to 0.50 cent higher.

JIM BROWN'S TALE OF SEX, FOOTBALL, SEX, LIFE AND SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEGAN ROSENFELD, The Washington Post 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Brown walks like something's hurting him. Maybe it's the pointy-toed black 
snakeskin cowboy boots. Maybe it's an old football injury. Or could one of his 
numerous girlfriends have delivered a well-placed kick? 
</P>
<P>
"I just walk funny," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He always gets out of cars slowly, so as not to pull anything. 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible the man is showing a few signs of age? It doesn't look as though 
Father Time has exactly stomped on him with cleats, but there are a few 
telltale shadows of life evident on the former Playgirl centerfold, who, after 
all, is 52. (He said. Biographical listings give his birth date as Feb. 17, 
1936.) The chest hairs peeking over the black tank top are flecked with gray, 
and the top of his forehead is now farther from his eyebrows than it was in 
either his football hero or acting days. Is he getting a tad overripe? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fruit and Meat 
</P>
<P>
Brown is fond of grocery metaphors when it comes to women, whom he is very fond 
of if they fit into a certain type. "I prefer girls who are young," he says in 
"Out of Bounds," his hot-off-the-press memoir. "When I eat a peach, I don't 
want it overripe. I want that peach when it's peaking." 
</P>
<P>
Or to put it another way, "If I wake up in the morning, I hunger for crab, then 
I don't want steak." Steak being a woman who is older, say over 25. 
</P>
<P>
And, the book continues, he wants a woman who's small. "I don't mean mousy 
small. I mean tight. Petite. Delicate. No excess. When I get into the bedroom, 
I don't want to see anything that's big like me." Not that he looks only for 
vacuous one-night stands -- at least not any more. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he understands why some people might find his attitude about women, 
as portrayed in this book, offensive; that people, especially females, might 
blanch at his constant references to "chasing girls" like a hunter after game, 
picking up whole coveys of them and passing them out among his friends, 
swapping them, sharing them and then moving on to the next day's quarry. Or the 
endless parties/orgies, as he is happy to call them -- at which the primary 
decorations are naked women and the only rule is No Locked Doors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just My Sexuality' 
</P>
<P>
He admits in the book to following a double standard, to having a Main 
Girlfriend that you take out in public, as opposed to the women who were called 
freaks, the ones who arrived at Cleveland Browns parties, where "we'd all bring 
two or three girls. . . . Those pretty girls from Cleveland were allowed to 
express themselves freely and creatively." 
</P>
<P>
He knows, but he laughs. True, the laugh is a little tight, perhaps 
embarrassed, but basically, he said in an interview, he just is the way he is. 
"It's just my sexuality. Everybody likes something." 
</P>
<P>
Remember, sex sells. 
</P>
<P>
And by that standard, Brown's book should be a best-seller. The first half is 
mostly about his career in football, which he left in 1965 at his peak after 
nine great seasons as a fullback. The second half is about sex, and various 
movie stars he's known, and sex, and business, and politics, and sex. And about 
some of the legal troubles he's had involving various accusations of assaults 
on women, none of which he has been convicted of. 
</P>
<P>
He writes about not having affairs with co-stars Raquel Welch, Stella Stevens 
and Jacqueline Bisset; how he introduced Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to menage a trois; 
how his good buddy Muhammad Ali was having as many as five women a night in his 
early years while declaring himself celibate; and how he almost became part of 
Ali's management team before the fighter bucked the draft as a conscientious 
objector. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confusing, and Frank 
</P>
<P>
Actually, "Out of Bounds" is not a book in the traditional sense, because it 
was not written so much as talked. Brown and a collaborator, Steve Delsohn, 
then edited the tapes down to book length. The result is a sort of extended 
locker room monologue -- profane, outrageous, one-sided and occasionally 
thought-provoking. 
</P>
<P>
It is full of unexplained references and confusing allusions, but it also 
contains some frank character assessments and self-appraisal. It is Jim Brown's 
take on Jim Brown, his version of the way things were, his platform. He wrote 
it because he was not happy with his first book, "Off My Chest," also written 
with a collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
"It reflects my life honestly," he said. "It might shock you but if you read 
the whole book you might see I have a very individual point of view." 
</P>
<P>
His point of view, as reflected in the book and an interview, seems to be that 
of a combination radical black militant, sexual libertine and traditional 
Republican capitalist. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, he spoke recently at Huey Newton's funeral; has been friends 
with Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan; and has always, even as a 
young football player in the 1960s, been an out-front activist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Against Dependence 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he is against government programs that increase dependence 
and thinks the only way blacks will alleviate the "symptoms" -- substance 
abuse, black-on-black crime, poverty -- is to solve the problem of economic 
impotence. 
</P>
<P>
And guess what. He had an affair with Gloria Steinem! Or so he says in the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Of course that was back in 1968, and the only reason he wrote about it was in 
connection with the Eva Bohn-Chin affair. She was the woman, half-German, 
half-Jamaican, whom he met in London while filming "The Dirty Dozen" and whom 
police later said he threw off a balcony in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
What really happened, Brown says in the book, is that Bohn-Chin was jealous 
over his fling with Steinem, whom he met while she was doing a magazine profile 
of him while he was filming in Arizona. Bohn-Chin left his apartment -- with 
Brown's car -- and went to stay with a girlfriend. He talked Bohn-Chin into 
returning home; they planned a playful evening with three other women. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, while Bohn-Chin was on the phone with this girlfriend, Brown 
started getting jealous. And they started fighting. And the neighbors called 
the police. While Brown was trying to persuade the police, at one point with 
his forearm, that it was just a minor domestic dispute, Eva Bohn-Chin "kind of 
freaked" and tried to vamoose over a rear balcony, but fell and rolled under 
it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Charged 
</P>
<P>
The police, meanwhile, handcuffed Brown and took him to the station, and 
despite the lack of any allegations from Bohn-Chin, threatened to charge him 
with attempted murder. The police leaked the incident to the press but didn't 
charge him with striking her. "And the toughest thing I did to Eva was slap 
her." 
</P>
<P>
And he knows that was wrong. "I have also slapped other women," he wrote. "And 
I never should have, and I never should have slapped Eva, no matter how crazy 
we were at the time. I don't think any man should slap a woman. In a perfect 
world, I don't think any man should slap anyone. . . . I don't start fights, 
but sometimes I don't walk away from them. It hasn't happened in a long time, 
but it's happened, and I regret those times. I should have been more in control 
of myself, stronger, more adult." 
</P>
<P>
He knows how to defuse potentially explosive situations better now, he said, 
and for this knowledge he credits Vital Issues, a self-improvement program for 
which he is executive director. The program now operates in 18 California 
prisons, he said, helping people in a "practical, holistic way." He gives an 
example: 
</P>
<P>
"Recently I ordered some food delivered to my house. I gave the guy a $100 
bill. He comes back at me with this 'I don't have change' thing, you know, with 
a real attitude. So I could see that this could easily develop into a bad 
scene. Instead I said, 'OK, you have three options: You can go find change. You 
can take a personal check. Or you can take the food back.' 
</P>
<P>
"So he thinks about it. Then he said, 'Can I use your phone?' And he came back 
and took a check. . . . The main thing is to avoid the negative at all costs. 
That's the monkey. The next is to find the bottom line, the 'it.' The fact is 
not personal. The third thing is to evaluate the options and pick the best. In 
that situation, the negative could have led us in all kinds of directions. . . 
. Now I keep my goals in mind." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Set of Goals 
</P>
<P>
Those goals now include a low-budget film company, Ocean Productions, and the 
knowledge that more negative press is not good for business. Ocean Productions 
is about to release its first film -- intended primarily for overseas 
distribution -- a $300,000 action adventure starring Brenda Vaccaro and Frank 
Stallone (Sylvester's brother). 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Brown believes that he is a special target of the police, and 
that the FBI and the CIA have followed his activities because of his 
associations with black militants. While he admits to having done some bad 
things, "none of the stuff they charged me with I did." He thinks his activism 
was the primary reason his acting career derailed as well. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was almost a film company president once before, and that was with 
Richard Pryor, who was once his friend. 
</P>
<P>
He writes movingly of how he urged Pryor, subtly, to stop using drugs (Brown 
says he has never touched cocaine, heroin or LSD, although he has on occasion 
used marijuana in the bedroom). When Pryor set himself on fire, it was Brown he 
called for, and it was Brown who spent weeks by his side in the hospital, who 
was given his power of attorney, who helped him to the bathroom and with his 
physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also screened visitors (a great one, he writes, was Marlon Brando, who 
arranged for a cable hookup so that the three could watch a closed-circuit 
fight one night). He screened out most of Pryor's family because to him all 
they seemed to be interested in was money, and they didn't like that. 
Ultimately they sneaked into the hospital before Brown arrived and convinced 
Pryor -- or so he said to Brown -- that Brown should butt out. He was abruptly 
sent away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Hurt in Stride 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he took that hurt in stride, trying to be considerate of the 
pressures Pryor was under. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, he and Pryor agreed to start a film production company, part 
of Brown's campaign to get successful black artists to plow some of their money 
back into black communities. Plans were well under way, staff hired, when Brown 
once again was abruptly dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons he is unclear about, but probably have something to do with 
editing, Brown decided not to include this last episode in the book. But it 
undoubtedly fuels his scathing assessment of Pryor in the book as a man "who 
can't love anyone." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew a lot about Richard's tricks when I was dealing with him. I knew what 
the drugs and the idolatry were doing to him, I saw how he treated people. And 
yet he fooled me. He's the only person who has ever fooled me about emotions." 
All that remains of their friendship is the bit in Pryor's rap about his use of 
drugs when he pays a kind of comic's homage to Brown by making him a Jiminy 
Cricket figure beckoning him away from "the pipe." 
</P>
<P>
"That's how he thanked me," said Brown. "He never said it to my face."

SELF-ESTEEM IS KEY TO HELPING WOMEN CONTROL STRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MAUSHARD, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carol Price was having lunch at the Belvedere Hotel. She had just taught three 
hours of a women's workshop on stress and had asked the maitre d' in the John 
Eager Howard Room for prompt service so she would have time to check out before 
the afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
In a very few minutes, an amiable waitress brought the food. 
</P>
<P>
Price thanked her. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it's all cold food. I didn't have anything to do with it," replied the 
waitress, shunning the compliment. 
</P>
<P>
It was a stunning example of what Price had been preaching: how women need to 
overcome their inability to accept compliments and to think well of themselves. 
This tendency to play down accomplishments and abilities is a failing that in 
many women brings on stress, perhaps the malady of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"Why couldn't she just say, 'Thanks, I'm glad I could help,' " Price said, 
recounting the incident for the afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
It happens all the time, she said. Someone says your dress is beautiful; you 
say it's old. Your boss comments on the thoroughness of your report; you reply, 
"I hope so" instead of "Thanks, I worked hard on it." 
</P>
<P>
"Men have been given permission to know they are OK; you have also been given 
permission to know you are OK," Price told the 200 business and professional 
women who paid $48 each to attend the session sponsored by Career Track, a 
Boulder, Colo., company that specializes in inexpensive training workshops. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Believe We Are Valuable' 
</P>
<P>
"When we believe that we are valuable, we have far less stress," said Price, 
who then spent much of the day showing and telling women how to recognize their 
value and, thus, raise self-esteem while lowering stress. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to talk bad or good, we're going to talk comfortable and 
uncomfortable," she said of habits and life styles. 
</P>
<P>
When a person is comfortable with herself and the choices she makes, her 
self-esteem is high and her stress usually low, added Price, who has been 
giving training workshops for five years. Before that she taught elementary 
school, did counseling and managed the office of a group of gynecologists. She 
has a master's degree in criminal justice and has taken graduate courses in 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Price lives in Reddington Beach, Fla., but travels about 40 weeks a year 
teaching workshops. Not all are on stress and not all are exclusive to women. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is stress. 
</P>
<P>
Men don't necessarily have less stress than women, but "they have more avenues 
to get it out than we do," Price said. Stress, she said, comes from two 
emotions: anger and fear. Anger is the acceptable male emotion, fear the 
female. 
</P>
<P>
So it is in controlling their fears that women conquer stress. 
</P>
<P>
Easy? Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
First, women have to want less stress in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
And they don't? 
</P>
<P>
Many women do not really want less stress, contended Price. "Your stress is 
chosen, nurtured and heralded, like a first-born child. You like it," she told 
the workshop. "We advertise our level of stress as being our reason for living. 
We wear stress like a badge of honor." 
</P>
<P>
But there are other, healthier symbols of self-worth, such as control, calmness 
and competence. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to surviving, and thriving on, stress is control," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controlling Stress 
</P>
<P>
She described controlling stress as a three-stage exercise that can become a 
way of life: Preparation, process and maintenance. Price dwelt on preparation: 
"allowing the body to be in its best form" to deal with stress. 
</P>
<P>
This preparation stage relies heavily on the power of positive thinking: 
building and reinforcing a good self-image. It begins with physical readiness 
achieved through good diet, exercise, sleep and relaxation habits and includes 
two mental techniques, which she called visualization and affirmations. 
</P>
<P>
Visualization is a process of seeing oneself, mentally, achieving a goal or 
mastering a difficult situation. Basketball players, for example, might 
repeatedly visualize themselves making perfect free throws, so that when they 
stand at the foul line they can make the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Affirmations are positive, present-tense statements that a person repeats to 
herself often. Price, for instance, advocates saying these four things every 
day: 
</P>
<P>
"I am competent." 
</P>
<P>
"I am attractive." 
</P>
<P>
"I deserve respect." 
</P>
<P>
"I own this day." 
</P>
<P>
Inherent in the last statement are choice and control, which everyone needs to 
exercise, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controlling Your Life 
</P>
<P>
"Every act in your life is a choice," she said. "The time has come for you to 
start owning your life . . . You own it for what you choose to be. If you don't 
take ownership, let me make you a promise: someone else will. And they do it 
through guilt and they do it through demands. When it's your day, you choose 
how you live it; when you don't choose it, they choose how you live it and then 
you meet their demands. 
</P>
<P>
"Affirmations make or break you. It's just that simple." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are stages and techniques -- deep breathing, muscle relaxation, 
exercise, visualization -- Price summarized stress management in four commands. 
When some event becomes stressful (it is not the event that produces stress, 
but one's interpretation of an event that brings stress): 
</P>
<P>
Calm down. Deep breathing is the key. 
</P>
<P>
Take the problem and break it down: Is the problem based on truth? (70% of 
women's fears are not, she contended, and can, therefore, be dismissed along 
with the accompanying stress.) If the fear is real, consider what can be done 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
Choose the most comfortable solution. 
</P>
<P>
Stick to your choice. 
</P>
<P>
Price professes to practice what she preaches -- 99% of the time. She has 
worked at controlling stress so long "that I've learned how to do it," said 
Price, who is 39. Most women her age, however, have 35 to 37 years of being 
taught to live another, less-in-control, way. Those well-learned lessons must 
be overcome, and that does not happen overnight, she said. It won't, however, 
take another 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be willing to change dramatically," she said over lunch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dealing With Events 
</P>
<P>
Part of that change is how a person interprets potentially stressful events. 
"No event has ever produced stress; no event produces anything," Price 
contended. "When he talks to you in a way you don't like, it does not make you 
feel crummy. You color what he says and that's what gives you pain." 
</P>
<P>
Coloring, which Price described as self-talk, is the unnoticed step between an 
event and a feeling about that event. Women and men "color" with beliefs, 
values, attitudes and habits, and these "crayons" produce feelings. "You color 
every event in the world and then you feel; you do not feel before you color; 
you cannot feel before you color," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another key to stress control, Price said, is accountability -- making others 
responsible for their actions and reactions and, thus, ensuring you get the 
respect you deserve for your actions and reactions. 
</P>
<P>
When, for example, someone answers you sharply at work, resist the desire to 
fire back, Price advised. Say instead, in a calm voice, "Have I done something 
to offend you or are you having a bad day?" 
</P>
<P>
This forces the other person to look at his actions, she said, predicting that 
the potential stressor's behavior will usually change and his response become 
more reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
And the color of the feeling he evokes will probably be a cool blue instead of 
a fiery red.

<P>
An author named Banana, a sentimental vignette about a bowl of noodles and a 
slim volume of poems that infuses an ancient form with a dash of Americana have 
Japanese readers enthralled. 
</P>
<P>
With 99% literacy and a mostly youthful reading public that bought 1.6 billion 
books last year, popular novels and short story and poetry anthologies can 
reach sales levels of which American publishers only dream. 
</P>
<P>
And in what could be called Japan's version of the American "literary brat 
pack," a few youthful writers are dominating this country's best-seller lists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Widow's Struggles 
</P>
<P>
" 'One Bowl of Soba' Has Whole Nation Buying, Crying" screamed a recent 
headline in a Japanese newspaper about a short story that traces the struggles 
of a young widow to feed her two children. It depicts the three sharing one 
bowl of soba, or Japanese noodles, as a New Year celebration. 
</P>
<P>
For leaving Japanese readers sobbing in their soba, author Ryohei Kuri's work 
has prompted scant literary praise but drawn accolades from other quarters for 
reawakening a sense of compassion for the underdog in this affluent country. 
</P>
<P>
And for exposing spiritual poverty in contemporary Japan, the story has made 
Kuri a rich and celebrated man. 
</P>
<P>
A magazine containing his story sold out 600,000 copies almost instantly. A 
book of Kuri's stories, including "Soba," scored third on a June list of 
national best-sellers, and a movie deal is in the making. 
</P>
<P>
Rising literary star Banana Yoshimoto, 25, wrote three of the top 10 works of 
fiction on the same list, including the novel "Tsugumi," which had been the No. 
1 best-seller for several weeks, and "Kitchen," her first novel. 
</P>
<P>
The self-named daughter of a Marxist literary critic won the prestigious Kaien 
prize in 1987 for "Kitchen," a 68-page book dashed off in three months while 
Yoshimoto worked as a waitress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finding Sanctuary 
</P>
<P>
The young heroine of "Kitchen" finds sanctuary at night when she drags her 
mattress into her kitchen to be lulled to sleep by the hum of the refrigerator. 
Later, she wins a man's heart with a dish of fried pork and rice. 
</P>
<P>
Critic Shinichiro Nakamura, who chose Yoshimoto for the Kaien prize, wrote that 
the author broke new ground by "totally ignoring traditional literary 
accomplishment and describing feelings and senses freely. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a new literature came from this defiant attitude of keeping these 
things on the page whether or not they fit the old rules of literature." 
</P>
<P>
Another young woman who recently shook the literary establishment is Machi 
Tawara, a 27-year-old doe-eyed poet whose "Salad Anniversary" made publishing 
history by selling nearly 3 million copies -- more than any other book of 
modern poetry. 
</P>
<P>
She startled practitioners of the 1,300-year-old native art of tanka poetry by 
using contemporary language, including more than 150 borrowed Western words 
such as McDonalds and valentine. Tawara is credited with revitalizing the 
tanka, a five-line poem that follows a strict 5-7-5-7-7 syllable count. 
</P>
<P>
"I am using short poems to write about the small emotional epiphanies we make 
every day that usually go unnoticed," she said. "Many people write to tell me 
they saw their own feelings expressed in my poetry." 
</P>
<P>
Tawara's American translator, Juliet Winters Carpenter, says that although 
"Salad Anniversary" suggests Emily Dickinson with touches of Dorothy Parker's 
humor, many Japanese critics have faulted her poetry as slight. The book will 
be published in the United States in January by Kodansha International Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest sensation in Japanese publishing in recent years is Haruki 
Murakami's novel, "Norwegian Wood," whose title is taken from the Beatles song. 
The book, published in two volumes by Kodansha, has sold more than 4 million 
copies since its release in 1987, and spent 21 months on best-seller lists. 
</P>
<P>
"Norwegian Wood" is a meandering tale of love and rootlessness among Japanese 
youth in the 1960s and '70s, and features a protagonist in his 20s who hangs 
out in coffee shops and jazz bars, reads "The Great Gatsby" and listens to Bob 
Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of love story that Japanese have not been party to in the past in 
their popular literature," says Kodansha senior editor Elmer Luke. "The 
characters flit in and out of meaningless relationships, but in the midst of 
all the wandering there is the will for affection." 
</P>
<P>
An earlier Murakami book, "Wild Sheep Chase," will be published soon in the 
United States by Kodansha. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maintaining Momentum 
</P>
<P>
Many popular authors pump out 10 or more books a year to feed the appetite of a 
voracious reading public, and to keep the momentum going in what publisher 
Minato Asakawa calls the jitenshya sogyo, literally the "bicycle operation." 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese authors believe that when you stop peddling your bicycle will fall 
down. So to keep your life and career at the same pace you never stop 
peddling," said Asakawa, editorial director at Kodansha. 
</P>
<P>
But Asakawa noted Japan's literary "brat pack" can afford to pause on the 
literary treadmill because their works are selling in larger numbers than ever 
before.

MACHINISTS VOW TO FIGHT IF UNITED WORKERS' BID OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the strongest language it has used so far, United Airlines machinists union 
Thursday urged the board of United's parent firm, UAL Corp., to reject a 
$6.75-billion labor-management buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Louis R. Schroeder, president of District 141 of the International Assn. of 
Machinists, said in a letter to UAL's board that the $300-a-share proposal 
"jeopardizes the livelihoods of the work force and the long-term viability of 
the carrier." 
</P>
<P>
United's management has tried to persuade the machinists to join the bid, which 
is also backed by United's pilots union and by British Airways. Financing for 
the proposal was reviewed by UAL's 13 outside directors Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The labor-management proposal would give employees a 75% stake in the airline. 
Management, including Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, would get 10%, and British 
Airways would get a 15% stake. 
</P>
<P>
United's flight attendants said Thursday that they have reviewed the proposal 
and might participate. But the machinists, United's largest labor group, have 
opposed the buyout as unnecessary and too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Challenge Possible 
</P>
<P>
The machinists have said UAL is worth no more than $240 a share, and have 
questioned the airline's ability to survive a debt-financed transaction. UAL 
stock, which has soared in recent weeks as a result of takeover and buyout 
talk, closed Thursday at $280.50, down $2.75, in New York Stock Exchange 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who represents 23,000 mechanics and other United ground employees, 
said that if the board approves the bid, the machinists will have "no 
alternative other than to take all actions available to aggressively protect 
our members against its negative implications." 
</P>
<P>
The machinists could mount a legal challenge to block the transaction, or they 
could strike after their contract becomes amendable next month. Financial 
sources said the possibility of a job action might make lenders think twice 
about financing a buyout without the machinists' support. 
</P>
<P>
The union has also talked to Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass and has said he 
is interested in a possible bid for the airline. He is believed to own about 2% 
of UAL's shares. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the labor-management bid, UAL has also received a $275-a-share offer 
from Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis. Davis indicated that he is not yet 
prepared to revise his bid because his staff is still reviewing confidential 
financial documents obtained from the airline this week. He had said he might 
consider a higher bid if warranted by the confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
The labor-management proposal would reportedly be financed with $4 billion 
loaned by a consortium of banks led by Citibank and Chase Manhattan. The banks 
would additionally lend $1.3 billion to an employee stock ownership plan, which 
would own 75% of the airline's stock. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, British Airways would contribute $750 million in return for 
preferred stock, and the pilots' union would contribute $200 million from its 
pension fund. It would also receive preferred stock in return. Management was 
reported to be planning a contribution of $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots have also said they would contribute another $250 million in wage 
concessions and increased productivity, but the machinists contend that the 
figure is inflated. For example, $40 million of the pilot contribution is not 
cash, but is said to be credit for wages lost during a 1987 strike. The 
machinists do not think that lost wages should count as equity.

ON THE EDGE WITH HUMBERTO LUNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Humberto Luna stands grinning beneath a billboard bearing his likeness at the 
spot where, according to Hollywood lore, dreams come true -- Hollywood and 
Vine. 
</P>
<P>
The symbolism is not missed. Luna has seen his fondest dream come true -- and 
then some. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought it would be like this," Luna said. "I wanted to live well and 
do something on radio. I still don't believe that because of radio I'm doing so 
much and so many people know me. I still feel it's a dream." 
</P>
<P>
If so, it's an awfully sweet one. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old morning deejay is the highest-rated Spanish-language radio 
personality in Southern California, a superstar of Spanish-language media and, 
accordingly, its highest-paid performer. Luna recently negotiated a $1-million 
annual salary and a five-year contract for his goofy morning-drive antics on 
KTNQ-AM "Super 10-Q" (1020). 
</P>
<P>
"This makes him clearly the highest-paid Spanish radio personality in the 
country and puts him right up there with the top-flight English-language disc 
jockeys," said Jim Blancarte, the lawyer who helped negotiate Luna's lucrative 
deal. "I thought he was worth twice as much. He continues to be on the cutting 
edge of Spanish-language radio." 
</P>
<P>
The cutting edge of Spanish-language radio sounds a lot like English-language 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
Luna spends each morning from 6 to 11 bantering with his collection of 
"character" callers (whom he dubs his "Luna-tics"), employing sound effects 
such as toilets flushing or eggs frying, discussing news events, introducing 
popular Latin musical selections and generally being his charming and affable 
self. 
</P>
<P>
Luna says he still can't quite believe he is so well remunerated for having a 
good time. 
</P>
<P>
"I thank God that I have fun and that they pay me for it," he said. "They are 
paying me for doing something I enjoy. I prepare something the day before, but 
most is improvisation. It's the facility that God has given me to think 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Luna's morning show is broadcast via satellite and heard in San Francisco, 
Chicago, New York, Miami and parts of Latin America. This week he was 
broadcasting live from Mexico in honor of Mexican Independence Day (which is 
Saturday). Luna often broadcasts shows from remote locations, including Rio de 
Janeiro, Buenos Aires and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
And Luna's stardom extends beyond radio. He has had roles in 24 films made in 
Mexico and also hosts "Hablemos de Cine" ("Let's Talk Movies"), a weekly 
Spanish-language version of Siskel and Ebert's film-review TV show, syndicated 
by the Univision network and reaching an estimated 6.5 million viewers in the 
United States. Locally, "Hablemos de Cine" is aired on KMEX Channel 34. 
</P>
<P>
Luna is no overnight success. He has been on the air at KTNQ for 19 years and 
started in radio when he was 20. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Luna marks the start of his broadcasting career much earlier -- at a 
shoe store in Tlaltenago, the small town in which he was born in the state of 
Zacatecas, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I began as an emcee at 11," Luna said. "I worked at a shoe store announcing 
the specials." 
</P>
<P>
The shoe store was across the street from the town center and a kiosk where 
Luna would "broadcast" information via loudspeaker about the latest shoe sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I put two speakers outside and I was broadcasting," he said. "Inside the shoe 
store, I took the microphone and played music and did announcements, 
commercials. The store had very good sales. I would say things like: 'We have 
very nice shoes for you and your family. Come inside.' " 
</P>
<P>
A few years after his early success as a barker, he decided to go to Mexico 
City to attend radio announcers school. After studying two years, he received 
his certificate in 1968 and left for Los Angeles, where his father was living. 
</P>
<P>
Luna had hoped to learn English and eventually work in radio. Instead, he found 
there was an immediate need for Spanish-language broadcasters. He began working 
for XEGM-AM ((950), a station based in Tijuana but heard as far north as Los 
Angeles. At the time, the company that owned XEGM also operated KTNQ, and Luna 
moved to the Los Angeles-based station in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
He began accumulating a stable of regular callers with whom he would stage 
on-air routines and developed segments like a "Swap Meet of the Air," a "Dating 
Game" spoof; a gossip hour, and "Rate-the-Record," where listeners call in and 
decide whether a record should be played or broken. 
</P>
<P>
Luna is convinced that other deejays who have hit the airwaves after him have 
borrowed from his style and material. 
</P>
<P>
"I listen to all the other stations to see what they're doing," Luna explained. 
"All of them have stolen a little from me -- my informality, my jokes, my 
collaborators. . . . They do a lot of what I started. I established informal, 
crazy radio in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
His current boss, Heftel Broadcasting president and KTNQ general manager Ken 
Wolt, regards Luna as the station's crown jewel. 
</P>
<P>
Wolt said KTNQ and its sister FM station KLVE are the highest-billing 
Spanish-language radio stations in the country, with advertising revenues of 
more than $20 million in 1988 and $23 million projected for 1989. KTNQ was 
rated No. 15 among all 80 Los Angeles radio stations in the most recent 
Birch-Scarborough Ratings survey. Luna ranked eighth among morning shows, 
according to station manager Jeff Lieberman. 
</P>
<P>
"No one deejay (at KTNQ) has the audience that Humberto has," Wolt said. "It 
was through him that we catapulted. . . . That's why we were so anxious to sign 
him on long-term. We made it so lucrative that he's not going to go away." 
</P>
<P>
The usually outspoken Luna is uncharacteristically reticent when asked about 
his handsome salary. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm well paid but it makes me uncomfortable for my people, because I'm 
identified with the people, the average person, the average Mexican," Luna 
said. "I don't want to seem presumptuous, but I appreciate that they're 
recognizing my work after 20 years on the air."

CONGRESS NEARS ARTS FUNDING SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a sideshow staged by a Southern California congressman over, a 
House-Senate conference committee prepared Thursday for what most arts experts 
believe will be the climactic scene of a pivotal melodrama for the National 
Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
In key developments, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), the conservative nemesis of the 
endowment, reportedly held a "cordial and friendly" meeting Wednesday afternoon 
with the lawyer/arts advocate President Bush has nominated to head the 
endowment. 
</P>
<P>
And Thursday morning, the arts funding organization's acting chairman, Hugh 
Southern -- who arts insiders say guided the endowment's creative operations 
for seven years -- quit to take over as general manager of the Metropolitan 
Opera in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Southern had served as acting chairman for six months, presiding over the most 
tempestuous period in the endowment's 25-year history. His appointment at the 
Met becomes effective Nov. 1 -- shortly after Portland, Ore., attorney John E. 
Frohnmayer is expected to arrive to become the endowment's permanent head. The 
Met's top job had been vacant since the surprise resignation of general manager 
Bruce Crawford in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the meeting of Helms and Frohnmayer -- which was neither publicly 
announced ahead of time nor officially disclosed afterward -- and the 
resignation of Southern appeared to be a change of scene to a conference 
committee meeting room and, later, back on the floors of both chambers of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
This drama may well decide the future of federal funding of the arts in the 
United States -- all of this between now and about Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
It is a play whose script hasn't been completed and whose ending remains 
uncertain. But the apparently warm tone of the Helms-Frohnmayer meeting, which 
occurred as Frohnmayer called on the offices of key members of congress in a 
visit to Washington that began Monday, seemed to imply that -- public posturing 
aside -- Helms assumes there will be a viable arts endowment for Frohnmayer to 
run when he arrives in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Helms could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The two men did not talk about an amendment, successfully introduced by Helms 
in the Senate last month, to ban federal funding of "indecent" or "offensive" 
artworks. If the measure became law, most arts observers say a climate of 
censorship would result, in which the endowment would be hard-pressed to 
continue operating. 
</P>
<P>
The Helms wording bans federal funds for art or any other activities financed 
by the Interior Department and related agencies that involves "obscene or 
indecent materials" or that "denigrates the objects or beliefs of the adherents 
of a particular religion or nonreligion" or "denigrates, debases or reviles a 
person, group or class of citizens." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting of Helms and Frohnmayer occurred as the House prepared for a 
264-to-153 vote that killed an attempt by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) to 
attach the Helms language to instructions to House members of a conference 
committee that will meet -- perhaps as early as next week -- to reach a 
compromise on a 1990 funding bill for the endowment. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting of Frohnmayer and Helms and the departure of Southern -- apparently 
a part of a genteel transition at the endowment leading up to the expected 
arrival of a new management team picked by Frohnmayer -- were apparently 
hopeful signals that a resolution to the crisis may be possible. 
</P>
<P>
In all, said Rep. Sidney Yates (D-Ill.), the key endowment supporter in the 
House, "I would assume that the fight is not over." 
</P>
<P>
Yet to come are these skirmishes: 
</P>
<P>
The conference committee must navigate its way through a series of provisions 
added to the two different versions of the endowment funding bill, of which the 
Helms amendment is only one. Among other proposals is one that included 
Senate-added language making two private arts agencies caught up in the 
controversy ineligible for federal grants for five years. 
</P>
<P>
One of the blacklisted arts groups organized a show that included a photograph 
depicting a crucifix immersed in urine. The other sponsored a touring show of 
work by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
Other restrictions include a Senate-passed transfer of $400,000 from the 
endowment's visual arts program to other endowment departments. The transfer, 
which some observers contend is intended to punish the endowment division most 
directly involved in the controversy, would cripple the visual arts program's 
operations, critics contend. 
</P>
<P>
Endowment insiders and other arts observers say they fear conference committee 
endowment supporters may be forced to accept the blacklisting and money 
transfer as the price of the beating back the Helms amendment. While Yates said 
Thursday such a compromise is "not even in the realm of possibility," his 
ability to control the outcome of the committee deliberations is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the conference committee strikes the Helms wording and the other 
restrictive provisions, yet to be seen is whether Helms in the Senate and 
Rohrabacher or other conservatives in the House would attempt to force a 
recorded floor vote to reject the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
A settlement of the dispute over the funding bill would still leave 
conservatives with an opportunity to challenge the endowment's activities 
during Frohnmayer's confirmation, which is also scheduled to be completed by 
mid-October. While the committee with jurisdiction over the post is chaired by 
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and is thought to be sympathetic to the 
endowment, Helms and other conservatives could use floor debate on the 
confirmation as another opportunity to emphasize their dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
The entire controversy may be replayed early next year when both houses of 
Congress must process legislation to extend the endowment's life by another 
five years. Some House observers believe conservatives will accept a conference 
committee defeat now and launch a more concerted attempt early in 1990 to kill 
the reauthorization. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Helms nor his House sympathizers have disclosed their tactics. Yates 
said an attempt to force rejection of the conference committee report is a 
clear possibility. But a spokesman for Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), who signed 
a letter protesting the two grants but has since tried to distance himself from 
the Helms undertaking, said prospects for a pitched battle over rejecting the 
conference committee report in the Senate seem remote. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be extremely rare to get into a debate over rejecting the conference 
committee report over a Jesse Helms amendment," the Wilson spokesman said, but, 
"with Helms, you never know." 
</P>
<P>
A deadlock over the conference committee report -- which would mire all 
appropriations for such agencies as the Smithsonian Institution, the National 
Park Service and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well -- would 
force both houses to continue funding the Interior Department and related 
agencies under a continuing resolution. Such a resolution would retain 1989 
funding levels. 
</P>
<P>
Even longtime Washington arts observers are unsure how the situation will be 
resolved. Anne Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance, said 
she expects it to be settled "in a reasoned way," but declined to speculate on 
details.

INDEPENDENT FILM MAKERS, MARKETERS CONFRONT BOX-OFFICE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hot topic of the night was "sex, lies, and videotape." A seven-member panel 
of industry experts was trying to explain the surprise success of the 
$1.2-million independent film that, they say, is destined to gross $20 million 
in theaters -- more than many big-budget summer studio releases. 
</P>
<P>
The question: Why is "sex, lies, and videotape" making so much money in a 
marketplace where the vast majority of independent films are failing to break 
even? 
</P>
<P>
"Make a good movie," said Cineplex Odeon's head film buyer Neil Blatt, "and 
people will come." 
</P>
<P>
Blatt repeated the familiar Hollywood wisdom to a crowd of independent film 
makers and marketers at the Writers Guild Theater during the first of six 
weekly panel discussions sponsored by the American Film Marketing Assn. and the 
Independent Feature Project/West, a nonprofit support group for independent 
film makers. The panels were formed to address the crisis independent film 
makers and distributors are facing in the midst of a box-office boom dominated 
by major studios. 
</P>
<P>
There were 17 major-studio film releases in August, according to Variety, 
compared to only 16 independent releases -- the first month in recent times 
that the majors led in that category. So far this year, independent releases 
are down 15% from 1988. And while film production has dropped overall, the 
biggest shakedown is occurring among the independents, where production has 
fallen off 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Although the independents release almost three times as many films a year as 
the majors, they are capturing less than 7% of the total box office. And that 
percentage is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
"The general public does not want to see low-budget movies today, no matter how 
good they are," entertainment attorney Peter Dekom said. "What consistently 
sells in the marketplace are high-priced films with huge stars and lots of fast 
action or comedy. The summer bears that out. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Dirty Dancing.' 'Mystic Pizza.' 'sex, lies, and videotape.' Everyone sees 
those and thinks that they are the rule," Dekom said. "But for every one of 
those independent films that made it big, there are 300 that did not." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the independents' crisis comes on the heels of its own brief boom. 
Beginning in 1983, small film companies began to emerge and churn out products 
freely and film production reached new heights. What the films lost at the box 
office, they easily made up in the burgeoning ancillary markets -- home video, 
pay television and foreign sales. 
</P>
<P>
"The video market was an entrepreneurial guarantee that allowed independent 
producers to take risks," producer's representative Jeff Dowd said. "Video 
rights were often sold before the movie was finished, which virtually 
guaranteed a profit." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the ancillary markets are no longer Third World viewing arenas hungry 
for programming fodder. As film audiences -- foreign and domestic -- grow more 
sophisticated, they are demanding more A-title movies instead of the 
traditional B- and C-titles that used to stock video stores shelves in 
abundance. 
</P>
<P>
"Film audiences want more production value for their dollar, or yen, or franc, 
or whatever they are spending," Dekom said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a direct correlation between success in the theater and success in 
ancillary markets," Blatt said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the pressure is on independent film companies to produce instant 
box-office hits. Independents cannot afford a flop, unlike large studios that 
have the capital to sustain occasional box-office failures. Consequently, 
independent distribution companies are dissolving, consolidating, refocusing 
and forming ventures with major studios. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still room in Hollywood for independents to do business, but you have 
to do the right thing all of the time to make it," said Ronald Wanless, 
president of worldwide marketing for the Samuel Goldwyn Co., which is 
developing a sequel to last year's surprise independent hit "Mystic Pizza." 
</P>
<P>
"We're in it for the long haul. We'd rather make less films and minimize our 
mistakes. Many of the companies that have not done well have had a major hit 
and then been less than judicious with productions after that and dissipated 
all that money." 
</P>
<P>
Vestron struck box-office gold with "Dirty Dancing" in 1987. The sleeper 
grossed $62.9 million and ran for 44 weeks. Flush from that success, the small 
company beefed up its release schedule with no less than 20 movies, including 
"Earth Girls Are Easy," "Parents" and "Midnight Crossing" -- none of which 
performed well. Now, Vestron's distribution schedule is in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
"The marketers of quality independent films really aren't doing as effective a 
job as they might be doing," said Bruce Feldman, of the public relations firm 
Clein Feldman White. "And the main factor is money. They don't have the 
resources studios have. They simply don't. They can't compete on that level." 
</P>
<P>
Studios routinely spend $8 million to $10 million in advertising and promotion 
over a short time to release a film, while independents average about $2 
million for those films lucky enough to linger for months in the market. The 
prohibitive budget generally locks independents out of television advertising, 
where costs have risen an estimated 25% since last year. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by a multimillion-dollar Warner Bros. marketing campaign, "Batman" was 
able to debut across the nation on almost 2,200 screens. In comparison, Miramax 
opened "sex, lies, and videotape" six weeks ago in only two markets -- New York 
and Los Angeles. The film, which is currently on 363 screens, has been steadily 
adding theaters since to keep up with the spreading word of mouth -- which the 
panelists unanimously agreed is the most powerful form of advertising 
independents have. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a niche for independents as long as we act carefully and 
judiciously," said New Line's president of distribution Mitch Goldman. This 
summer, New Line wound up with a 2.4% domestic box-office share -- higher than 
one of the studios, Orion -- due largely to the ongoing slashing popularity of 
Freddy Krueger, who grossed $19.7 million with "A Nightmare On Elm Street 5: 
The Dream Child." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to carefully pick your spots," Goldman said. "It's called guerrilla 
marketing. The majors sometimes have blinders on, stumbling forward and bumping 
into each other. We have to look at the whole competitive marketplace and time 
our releases." 
</P>
<P>
Cannon demonstrated such marketing tactics last weekend with "Kickboxer." With 
no studio releases scheduled because of the slow post-Labor Day box office, 
Cannon released the Jean-Claude Van Damme action film on 973 screens and 
grossed $4.1 million -- good enough for third place in the weekend box office. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman suggested that independent film makers band together and form a trade 
association to advertise the intrinsic value in independent films and possibly 
lobby for legislative support. He says intelligent independent productions are 
often more artistic and culturally refreshing than studio films, where the 
bottom line is making money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cyclical. We're in a valley right now, a difficult period," Feldman said. 
"There are definitely hard times ahead, but the world isn't ending. It's up to 
us to make more out of what opportunities there are."

<P>
ROBERTSON FAVORS A LITTLE MYSTERY 
</P>

Stewart Robertson believes in the power of mystique. 
</P>
<P>
As newly appointed music director of the Inland Empire Symphony, Robertson will 
conduct a five-concert subscription series, beginning Oct. 21, at the 
California Theatre of Performing Arts in San Bernardino, as well as lead 
ensembles at local schools and universities. But he won't pitch at parties for 
funds for the parent Inland Empire Symphony Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a music director should go out and actually ask for money," 
Robertson, 41, said in a recent phone interview from Scotland where he was on 
vacation. "A lot of American orchestras have gone wrong in seeing their music 
director as a supersalesman. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a question of degree really. I will be involved in fund raising, but 
I believe there's a danger in overexposure. A music director has to know the 
general feeling and pulse of the community, but it's not necessary for him to 
be seen at the checkout stand at Safeway. A little bit of mystery goes a long 
way." 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Carmel, Robertson has since 1986 been music director of the Santa 
Fe Symphony, an orchestra with an annual subscription series of six concerts, 
and the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Wanting to work closer to home, Robertson vied with three conductors for the 
directorship of the Inland Empire Symphony and was hired earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson's two-year contract calls for him to spend a minimum of 80 days each 
season with the orchestra, and also to participate in The Sinfonia Mexicana, a 
cultural exchange program presented under the aegis of the Inland Empire 
Symphony Assn. Designed to lure Latinos who comprise more than 21% of the 
population of San Bernardino and Riverside counties to the concert hall with 
performances of classical music by Mexican composers, the program is hailed by 
the California Arts Council, which has awarded the orchestra an organizational 
grant of $7,020 for 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
"They have made a real effort to respond to the needs of the community," said 
Elliot Klein, the council's music administrator for organizational grants. 
"Appealing to Latinos makes a great deal of sense for the future of this 
orchestra. That group is their potential future audience." 
</P>
<P>
The Inland Empire Symphony has an operating budget for 1989-90 of $525,000; 
$325,000 to be spent on artistic personnel. With 53% of income earned through 
subscriptions and ticket sales, additional funding has come from private 
foundations, as well as $50,000 granted by the City of San Bernardino, and 
$20,000 from San Bernardino County. (The city has awarded an additional $15,000 
to the Sinfonia Mexicana, and $10,000 for the Inland Empire Opera, also under 
the auspices of the Inland Empire Symphony Assn.) 
</P>
<P>
To expand the Inland Empire Symphony's subscription base of 1,400, and increase 
its visibility in the community, Robertson will present informal lunchtime 
concerts in downtown San Bernardino and perform "provocative" repertory at 
local academic institutions, in addition to conducting at the 1,700-seat 
California Theatre of Performing Arts. He plans to program "standard classics," 
plowing his way through the cycles of Beethoven and Brahms symphonies, and 
later add a mix of contemporary music and neglected works, such as the Second 
Symphony of Edward Elgar, and symphonies by Michael Tippett and Scandinavian 
John Svendsen. 
</P>
<P>
"My approach in the past has been to choose contemporary music that is more 
immediately palatable," Robertson said, recalling that in his early days in 
Santa Fe he programmed Francis Poulenc's "Sinfonia" to much success. "I am not 
planning to flood our audience with contemporary works. I think one of the 
secrets of programming is to mix and match familiar and unfamiliar elements." 
</P>
<P>
Extensively involved in music education programs both in Europe and the United 
States, Scottish-born Robertson also will help oversee the Inland Empire 
Symphony Assn.'s successful Music in the Schools program. 
</P>
<P>
Having spearheaded educational efforts for the San Jose and Oakland symphonies, 
as well as opera programs for youth at the Scottish Opera and Glimmerglass 
Opera, Robertson eschews highly structured programs traditionally offered in 
classrooms. Rather, he expects to take smaller ensembles into schools and 
universities and art galleries and tantalize young audiences with adventuresome 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in giving youngsters a motivational experience. We need to let 
kids know that classical music is fun and exciting and can be a real emotional 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Teacher, motivator, performer. That's how Robertson characterizes the evolving 
role of today's orchestral musician. 
</P>
<P>
"No longer do 75 musicians in a symphony orchestra just play as a unit 100 feet 
away from the audience," Robertson explained. "The good ones are becoming 
flexible. The orchestra as we know it is not dying. It's just changing."

TALMI SEEKS TO BRING BACK THE AUDIENCES

Yoav Talmi frankly admits that his new post as music director-designate of the 
San Diego Symphony puts him on the podium of an organization that has been 
through major problems in recent years. (The orchestra missed a season and a 
half a few years ago because it went over budget.) But he believes that much of 
the rebuilding has now been done, thanks to the executive director Wesley 
Brustad and the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"My main challenge will be to attract larger audiences," the Israeli conductor 
said during an interview in his suburban Tel Aviv home, a bright and airy 
plant-filled two-story house where lately he has been staying only briefly 
between guest-conducting assignments. These take him across Europe, around the 
United States and as far afield as New Zealand before he comes to San Diego for 
the season opening Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Although Talmi will not assume the post of music director until the 1990-1991 
season, he speaks confidently and enthusiastically about formulating plans to 
invigorate San Diego's music scene. 
</P>
<P>
The need to draw larger audiences to San Diego's Symphony Hall tops Talmi's 
list of challenges. He will be combating what he terms one of the greatest 
problems facing American orchestras today -- declining audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know exactly why, but Americans have been going to concerts less in 
the past three, four years," he said. "We have to find a modus vivendi to 
convince people to go to one or two concerts a month. It's a necessity, not a 
luxury." 
</P>
<P>
It will be an uphill battle. "Some people think that all they need is the 
television," he lamented. He plans to reach would-be couch potatoes on their 
own turf by using television interviews to spread the message that "you need 
concerts for your soul and your well-being." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to increase audiences will extend to young music lovers-in-training. 
The San Diego Symphony has an established program of outreach to local schools, 
and Talmi intends to take a personal hand in bolstering it. 
</P>
<P>
He has a long record of educational outreach; his first post after graduating 
from Juilliard was assistant music director of the Louisville Orchestra, where 
in 1968 his main task was education and outreach to youth. He reported that his 
biggest success with the Israel Chamber Orchestra was a series of family 
concerts that incorporated brief narrative explanations about each composition 
in the program. 
</P>
<P>
He will not be able to effect much change in the coming season because he will 
conduct only three programs (two in October and one to end the season, in late 
May). But that doesn't deter him. 
</P>
<P>
"We also must start touring, and our touring must begin in Los Angeles," he 
said. Former music director David Atherton brought the group to the Hollywood 
Bowl, but Talmi wants to conduct a serious indoor concert. "I want to see how 
the public and the critics react," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the San Diego Symphony has never recorded. Talmi has extensive 
recording experience with the Israel Chamber Orchestra, where he was music 
director until 1988, and with European orchestras. He says he is already 
negotiating a first recording contract for San Diego Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising responsibilities pose a major new challenge for the 46-year-old 
conductor -- one that he would have preferred to avoid. "I was hired to bring 
the artistic level of the orchestra as high as possible, not to collect money," 
he said. "I need all of my time to study scores and make music." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he understands the need for fund raising, and he seems determined 
to do his part. He plans to become very involved in San Diego public life -- 
especially after he and his family take up full-time residence there in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
His personal tastes run the gamut from Beethoven and Brahms to Ravel, Mozart, 
Baroque opera and contemporary music. These favorites will figure in his choice 
of concerts, but he also plans to promote new music. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as my duty to produce and perform contemporary American works each 
season," he said earnestly, adding that he hopes to commission new works for 
premieres in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi acknowledged, however, that American audiences resist efforts to perform 
new music and that reliance on the public for financial support makes it 
difficult to focus too much attention on material that does not generate heavy 
public interest. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Diego public is very conservative," he noted, "but if we plan it 
right, we should be able to play American music."

Ten-month-old Michelle Olmos went home from the hospital Thursday, one day 
after an Anaheim police officer accidentally shot her while trying to fell a 
gunman who had commandeered her family's car. 
</P>
<P>
Her diapers puffy with bandages covering the wounds where the officer's bullet 
entered and exited her tiny body, the infant otherwise seemed unmarred by the 
frightening ordeal that led to the arrest of a convicted bank robber armed with 
a machine gun and semiautomatic handgun. The man had climbed into the car's 
back seat, held a gun to her mother's head and reportedly said, "Drive, or I 
will shoot you." 
</P>
<P>
"We're just lucky; she's lucky, and we're just glad to be home and together," 
said Peter Olmos, his daughter jangling keys in his lap. "If (the bullet) had 
hit her spine she would have been paralyzed for life, and it was just an inch 
or two away." 
</P>
<P>
But doctors told her parents that Michelle will suffer nothing more than a 
small scar that she "will eventually grow out of" because the bullet struck her 
in a dimply part of her thigh and buttock further padded by a diaper. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Paul Harston, 24, who surrendered at gunpoint, is expected to be 
arraigned today in Municipal Court in Fullerton on charges of kidnaping and 
assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer. He remained in Orange County 
Jail on Thursday with bail set at $250,000. Jail officials refused him 
visitors, saying he was under lock-down and was "medically unfit." 
</P>
<P>
Harston, in whose car police found two wigs and an automatic assault shotgun, 
is a convicted bank robber who authorities said is a possible suspect in other 
Orange County crimes. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Harston was convicted of the armed robbery of a 
Wells Fargo Bank in Westminster. In August, 1986, he was sentenced to five 
years in prison, followed by probation, but police and FBI agents would not say 
when Harston was released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on our knowledge, we are currently examining recent unsolved Orange 
County bank robberies to determine if he could be a suspect in any of them," 
said Buckey Cox, special agent in charge of the FBI office in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
But Cox said police do not believe the suspect was coming from or going to a 
bank robbery when a traffic officer attempted to flag him down for running a 
stop sign Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives were investigating reports by witnesses that the gunman threw a bag 
from his car as police chased him for about seven minutes before the shooting. 
No bag has been found, Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Harston was alone when he allegedly barged into Jody Olmos' car and 
took mother and daughter hostage, Hedgpeth said investigators are looking for 
possible accomplices because "the robberies we believe he was involved in, 
involved another person." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's bizarre drama unfolded about 10 a.m. Wednesday on State College 
Boulevard as Jody Olmos maneuvered her car in traffic toward a post office. She 
had heard sirens ahead of her along La Palma Avenue but assumed they were bound 
for a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Then her car was rear-ended, and it stalled. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Olmos said, a man opened her car door, climbed into the back 
seat and pointed a gun at her head. When she tried to flee with the baby, he 
told her to leave the child alone and drive. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting beside her, a seat belt securing her to the passenger seat, was 
Michelle. The gunman did not threaten the baby, Olmos said. Seconds or minutes 
later -- Olmos has no idea -- she heard two shots and her rear windshield 
shattered. An officer was standing near her window, ordering her to get out of 
her car with the baby. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman remained in the back seat, but police told her he had dropped his 
semiautomatic gun onto her purse in the front seat. She ran to a flower shop 
with the screaming baby, and only then did someone notice a blackened hole on 
her daughter's diaper. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old mother would only learn later that Anaheim officers were 
chasing the man for several miles because he failed to pull over for a traffic 
violation. When traffic backed up on State College south of La Palma Avenue, 
the man abandoned his car, which then rolled forward into another vehicle, 
pushing it into Olmos'. The gunman climbed inside her maroon Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing the man pointing a gun at the woman, then at the officer, the officer 
stood at the back of the car and fired two shots, Hedgpeth said. The officer, 
who has only been identified as an "experienced motorcycle officer," fired in 
self-defense and to prevent either a murder or a kidnaping, Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
The shots, fired from about 10 feet away, may have been slowed by the rear 
windshield and the passenger seat in which Michelle sat. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district attorney's office is investigating the shooting for any 
criminal wrongdoing, and police internal affairs officers are checking for any 
violations of department rules or policy, a preliminary examination of the case 
vindicates the officer, Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
It "will be a couple of weeks" before the investigation of the officer's 
judgment and actions is completed, Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
As is required by the Police Department, the officer has been given two days 
off with pay and must see the staff psychiatrist. The officer will not return 
to duty until he is certified as being ready, Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
The Olmoses have criticized the officer who wounded their daughter, saying he 
should have seen the child's safety seat, which they believe was visible from 
behind the car. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was 10 feet away," Jody Olmos said, "he should have been able to hit the 
guy. He missed twice. . . . He could have hit Michelle or me." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the preliminary vindication by his department's investigators, "any 
conscientious officer would feel bad" about shooting an infant, Hedgpeth said. 
"He is very concerned about the baby's welfare." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle, who was released Thursday afternoon from UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, had only a few reminders of her hospital visit: the dressings on her 
right buttocks and a bandage on her arm where she had been fed intravenously 
for nearly 30 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle and other members of her family -- her parents, her 27-year-old aunt, 
her infant cousin, two brothers, 4 and 11, and a 13-year-old sister -- 
celebrated her homecoming quietly Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
In the Olmoses' Anaheim living room, the dark-haired girl pulled her big 
sister's hair, sucked on keys, played with a Slinky toy, crawled around the 
couch and nursed a bottle, careful only when she sat down on her bandaged 
behind. The bullet left a dime-sized wound. It exited near the center of her 
back, leaving a larger wound. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle watched herself on several television news shows with the uninterest 
only a child could display. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't even know what's happened to you," her father laughingly told her. 
"That's probably good."

GOVERNOR GETS BILL ON TOBACCO; $17.5 MILLION FOR O.C. HEALTH CARE

<P>
Ten months after passage of Proposition 99, the anti-smoking tobacco tax 
initiative, the Senate and Assembly on Thursday sent Gov. George Deukmejian a 
$1.5-billion bill implementing the measure on back-to-back lopsided votes. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would provide about $17.5 million from the cigarette tax to 
help pay Orange County hospitals and doctors for emergency medical services 
given to the poor without reimbursement. County hospitals estimate that they 
have provided more than $200 million in such uncompensated care. 
</P>
<P>
But county officials said Thursday that they hope some of the money can be used 
to increase the level of health care available to the poor. One possibility, 
for example, is granting more money to the county's ailing trauma centers, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, which closed its 
trauma center last week, administrators said Thursday that their decision could 
be reconsidered if enough money is available. 
</P>
<P>
Richard E. Butler, a vice president at the hospital, said it would take $3 
million for the trauma center to break even. "If the factors change so that the 
money makes a different picture for us, we'll reconsider" the center's closure, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lobbyists and Officials Cheer in Hall 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, lobbyists and officials from counties, medical groups and other 
health groups that backed Proposition 99 whooped and cheered in the hall 
outside the Assembly chamber moments after the measure won final legislative 
approval on a 68-2 vote. Earlier, the Senate had approved the Proposition 99 
implementation bill by a 38-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian is expected to sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The impromptu celebration by health advocates allowed a release of tension that 
had built up during weeks of intense bargaining by lawmakers and a threat to 
the bill posed by a last-minute lobbying effort by the tobacco industry. The 
lobbying effort keyed on a provision of the bill that directs $28.6 million 
over two years into an anti-smoking TV print ad campaign aimed at California's 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies, said to be fearful that a TV ad campaign would persuade more 
Californians to give up smoking, hoped to delete the provision from the bill. 
They won some allies in the Legislature, including Senate Republican Leader Ken 
Maddy of Fresno, who said he opposed using any of the money for TV ads because 
he did not think mass advertising was the best way to reach smokers. 
</P>
<P>
Maddy, who had dropped his objections Wednesday, carried the bill on the Senate 
floor. He said many compromises were made by lawmakers. But he said the overall 
benefits of the bill overrode objections to individual parts. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have $1.5 billion to give away you usually can find room for 
accommodations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5 billion contained in the bill represents 2 1/2 years worth of money 
raised by the tobacco tax increases mandated by Proposition 99. The measure 
caused cigarette taxes to go up 25 cents a pack and resulted in comparable 
increases to other tobacco products, such as cigars. The initiative directed 
that most of the money be used to pay for health programs for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the money received from the tax will be sent directly to hospitals, 
according to a formula based on each facility's uncompensated care burden. But 
at least $10 million of Orange County's share will be distributed for health 
services by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said he would like to see some of 
the money go to help trauma centers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the trauma-center system saves lives," Riley said. "The proof positive 
is there. Trauma centers should be part of the goal." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) has coordinated a committee in the 
county that examines health services for the poor. That committee might 
consider how the money could best be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Committee member and Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said: "The committee is going 
to have an opportunity to exchange ideas and concerns at a level that we've 
never done before. It might open up some areas for financing." 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Mayester, a health care advocate for the poor, expressed concern over 
whether the indigent will actually benefit from the extra money. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important money," Mayester said, "(but) I guess I wonder whether 
it will translate into more accessible services for people. I'm sorry there 
isn't something written into the bill."

<P>
DEBATE FIRES UP OVER AIRPORT AFTER CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
As investigators began trying to find out why a light plane crashed in a Buena 
Park neighborhood after taking off from Fullerton Municipal Airport, Buena Park 
officials on Thursday said the accident is an example of why the facility 
should eventually be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
"The area surrounding the airport has become urbanized, and it's going to 
become more and more" so, Buena Park City Councilman Donald L. Bone said. 
"Downstream, I would like to see the airport closed." 
</P>
<P>
"This City Council believes the airport has outlived its usefulness," added 
Buena Park City Manager Kevin O'Rourke. 
</P>
<P>
In the last nine months, there have been three light plane crashes in Buena 
Park. The latest accident happened Wednesday when a two-seat Cessna 152 
carrying an instructor and a student pilot lost power about a minute after 
takeoff and crashed at the intersection of Artesia Boulevard and Darlington 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
The student pilot, Moyra Pim, 29, was reported in critical but stable condition 
Thursday at UCI Medical Center in Orange with second- and third-degree burns 
over 50% of her body. Instructor Bradley Pearce, 28, of Garden Grove was 
treated for arm burns and released. 
</P>
<P>
Pim, from Great Britain, had been on vacation visiting her boyfriend, Mark 
Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said she was resting Thursday night after "an agonizing day." 
</P>
<P>
"She's not able to hear or reply," Fisher said, adding that her face is 
completely bandaged. "It's still impossible for us to realize this happened to 
such a beautiful girl. On a scale of 1 to 10, she was definitely a 10." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton airport statistics show an average of about two crashes a year during 
the last five years, but Fullerton officials are satisfied with the facility's 
operation. The airport, which is home to about 600 planes, handled 162,000 
takeoffs and landings last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the airport is a very safe place," said Fullerton City Manager 
William C. Winter. "The record of incidents does not reflect an alarming 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Paoli, chairwoman of Fullerton's Airport Users Task Force, chided Buena 
Park officials for "overreacting" to Wednesday's crash. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not to minimize the seriousness of any aircraft accident . . . but I 
think people have got to be realistic," said Paoli, who has flown out of the 
Fullerton airport for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't live in Utopia. I wish people would try to step out of themselves a 
little bit and realize the airport is not unleashing an atom bomb on Buena 
Park." 
</P>
<P>
Winter also pointed out the economic benefits that the airport brings to both 
Fullerton and Buena Park. A 1986 study estimated that next year, the airport 
will have a direct economic impact of $30.1 million on the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints About Noise 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the benefit comes through companies who use private planes and enjoy 
having the availability of the airport next to private businesses," Winter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton officials acknowledge that they regularly receive complaints about 
airplane noise. Fullerton has two citizen advisory committees to address 
airport issues: the Noise and Safety Committee and the Airport Users Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Fullerton bought sound-measuring devices that are used in 
areas where residents complain of excessive noise. The devices have helped to 
identify particularly noisy planes so that the pilot could correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Paoli said that if the cause of Wednesday's crash ends up being linked to a 
deficiency of the airport, officials would certainly make some changes. "We are 
always looking for procedures to keep things quieter and safer," she added. 
</P>
<P>
But across the board, the majority of airplane crashes are caused by pilot 
error such as running out of fuel, Paoli said. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Councilman Bone said that his City Council probably will write a 
letter to the Federal Aviation Administration requesting a review of airport 
procedures to see if more stringent maintenance and inspections are warranted 
at the Fullerton airport. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult problem," Bone said. "By the grace of God, nobody was killed 
this time, but how long will our luck hold?" 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jim Wall of the National Transportation Safety Board said the 
investigation of Wednesday's crash will probably take several weeks to 
complete. The mangled aircraft has been taken to Long Beach Airport for further 
inspection, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting until we get some time to look at the rest of the hardware," 
said Wall, adding that the delay is partly due to about 50 similar 
investigations under way in the region.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATIONS PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana residents will celebrate the independence of Mexico and other Central 
American countries Sunday with the county's first Fiesta de Independencia 
Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico celebrates its independence from Spain on Saturday, but the parade was 
scheduled for Sunday because of traffic reasons, said Roger Kooi, the city's 
downtown development manager. Kooi said the celebration also honors Guatemala, 
Costa Rica, El Salvador and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't anything like this in Orange County," said City Councilman Miguel 
A. Pulido, adding that the nearest area with an official parade is East Los 
Angeles, which will conduct its event today. 
</P>
<P>
The parade is part of a weekend street fair sponsored by Santa Ana merchants 
that has been held for the past four years, Kooi said. 
</P>
<P>
The parade is scheduled to include floats, bands and clowns. A main feature 
will be a group of a dozen stunt motorcyclists, most of whom come from Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Velasco, a talk-show host from Mexico City featured on the Spanish 
International Network, will be the parade's grand marshal, Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido said organizers hope the parade will remove some misconceptions about 
independence day celebrations in Latin American countries. 
</P>
<P>
"There's misinformation as to what that means," he said. "A lot of folks think 
that Cinco de Mayo (May 5) is independence day." That holiday celebrates the 
Mexican military victory at Puebla over a French expeditionary force in 1862. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will begin at 1 p.m. on Sunday. Participants will begin lining up at 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will start at 15th and Main streets and travel south to 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
The festival will run from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. today and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on 
Saturday and Sunday. It will take place on 4th Street between Broadway and 
French Avenue. The festival will include concession stands, music and clowns. A 
special ceremony, called El Grito (cry of independence), featuring local civic 
leaders, will be held at 6:30 p.m. today.John Wayne AirportFAA Awards $950,000 
to Improve Security 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has awarded the county $950,000 to pay for 
security improvements at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The grant will be used for radio communications, card reader and video 
surveillance systems. 
</P>
<P>
"They were persuaded by the county's need," Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach) said Thursday. "This will spare the expense to county residents." 
</P>
<P>
Cox is one of two Republicans who sit on the House Subcommittee on Government 
Activities and Transportation, which will begin hearings Sept. 25 on aviation 
security in response to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie, 
Scotland, in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally we are updating airline security across the country," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
The county will also receive $3.25 million this fiscal year to pay for airport 
improvements including roadways, taxiways, and aircraft rescue and firefighting 
vehicles. That money is part of $10 million budgeted for the airport through 
1992, but will be delivered earlier than expected.

Huntington Beach Police Lt. Robert Morrison, 58, who founded the city's Aero 
Bureau and has logged more than 2,700 hours as a pilot in a police patrol 
helicopter, will retire today after more than 30 years of police work. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, who has served with Huntington Beach since 1966, was one of the first 
two pilots to fly helicopters for the city in 1968. Huntington Beach was the 
first city in Orange County and fifth city in the United States to initiate a 
helicopter patrol program. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back, law enforcement has been very rewarding. There has not been a 
day that I got out of bed and didn't look forward to going to work," said 
Morrison, who lives in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente resident Mo Tidemanis, a development firm executive, has been 
appointed to the board of directors of the Boys and Girls Club of the South 
Coast Area. 
</P>
<P>
"Mo's dedication to the youth in this area and to the San Clemente community 
enhances the high level of our current board members," said Kent Campbell, 
executive director of the club. 
</P>

Cheryl Bingham, 20, and Christine Bingham, 43, of Yorba Linda were named 
winners of the recent California Mother-Daughter Pageant in Hollywood, sharing 
the $3,000 first prize. Each also received a new dress. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time either of the Binghams had entered a beauty pageant. "I 
thought it sounded like a new and exciting experience and it was," said the 
mother, a tax accountant and part-time model. Her daughter, a student at Cal 
State Fullerton, is also a model. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Hills resident Craig Miller, owner of the Anaheim-based American 
National Watermattress Corp., was inducted into the Waterbed Retailers Assn.'s 
Hall of Fame at its convention in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-member association, based in Chicago, cited Miller for 24 years of 
work for the group as well as his charitable work and enterprise. It was only 
the seventh time that a Hall of Fame induction has been made by the water-bed 
association. 
</P>
<P>
"Craig built a successful manufacturing business from a two-bit garage 
operation," the citation states.

Supervisor Thomas F. Riley will be presented with an Open Space Award from the 
Landscape Architectural Foundation/Class Fund at its fourth annual award 
banquet Oct. 12 at the Irvine Hilton and Towers. 
</P>
<P>
Banquet chairman Francis Sullivan said the award is being presented to Riley 
for his outstanding contributions to the preservation and development of public 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Beach residents Betty and George Wakeling, founders of Concept 7, a 
family service for abused and neglected children, were honored for their years 
of work at a champagne reception aboard the yacht Dulcinea. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) presented the Wakelings with a 
congressional award and a letter from President Bush and his wife, who cited 
the couple for their "years of service to your fellow man. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The Wakelings have been with Concept 7 for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove schoolteachers Barbara Barker, Jack Sorter, Ed Peterson, Margaret 
Duhamel, Jan Burwell, Carol Schnitger and Lynne Saito will be honored with I 
Make a Difference awards from the Garden Grove Education Assn. at a recognition 
banquet Thursday. The seven recipients were selected for their volunteer work 
and community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Bannister, mayor of Huntington Beach, will be presented the Exploring 
Community Service award by the Orange County Council, Boy Scouts of America, in 
recognition of his service to youth. The presentation will take place at a 
dinner Oct. 11 at the Seacliff Country Club in Huntington Beach.

KEY WITNESS SAYS HE PAID 2 MARSHALS TO KEEP U.S. CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana owner of a security firm, painting a detailed portrait of an 
alleged cash-for-influence scheme in the federal court system, testified 
Thursday that he paid thousands of dollars in cash and favors to two U.S. 
marshals to secure and hold onto a lucrative government contract. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Rydzewski, 33, ran a 200-employee security firm in Orange County that, 
between about 1982 and 1984, received some $400,000 from the local district of 
the U.S. marshal's office to aid in the seizure and guarding of evidence and 
protection of government witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
He was able to get and keep the no-bid, oral contract, he claimed in U.S. 
District Court in Santa Ana on Thursday, by making payments of more than $7,000 
to two U.S. marshals from Orange County who controlled the contract and by 
doing financial favors worth perhaps thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line -- it was for the marshal's contract," Rydzewski said in 
explaining why he made the repeated payments. "That's basically why I did it, 
so there would be no upset of the apple cart." 
</P>
<P>
His four hours of testimony came in the second day of the trial of Joseph 
Gieniec, 43, of Santa Ana, and Gordon Tornberg, 59, of Tustin, both of whom had 
worked at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles and are now facing several 
counts of accepting illegal gratuities from Rydzewski. 
</P>
<P>
In cross-examination late Thursday, defense attorney James L. Waltz sought to 
point out discrepancies in Rydzewski's accounts of his business dealings and to 
show that he had been coached by government prosecutors on some tactics -- such 
as speaking directly to the 12-member jury. 
</P>
<P>
But the bulk of the defense's interrogation of the government's star witness 
will come today, when Rydzewski again takes the stand. The defense has 
maintained that the money that changed hands was a reflection of friendship, 
not corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Waltz has also suggested that Rydzewski struck a deal with prosecutors for his 
testimony. Rydzewski, who ran a company called Lyons International Security, 
has already pleaded guilty to charges arising from the alleged scheme and has 
been cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Rydzewski, under questioning from Assistant U.S. Atty. Bruce E. Reinhart, said 
that, in addition to making straight cash payments to Gieniec and Tornberg, he 
also gave loans for which he never expected to be reimbursed, hired their 
friends and relatives and did other financial favors. 
</P>
<P>
Rydzewski testified that he hired Tornberg's wife as a guard, paid her slightly 
more than other employees with similar experience, and tolerated her tardiness 
and what he described as problems on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't going to fire the marshal's wife," he said. "There wasn't much I 
could do." 
</P>
<P>
The motive, he said, was the U.S. marshal's contract, the result of what was 
apparently an unusual decision by local officials to seek help from the private 
sector for the growing task of seizing evidence in criminal investigations and 
protecting witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the contract profitable, Rydzewski said, but it was also a 
prestigious inroad to other work in the security industry. "I just really fell 
in love with that contract. I would do anything to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
But that attitude changed in late 1984, Rydzewski testified, because Gieniec -- 
whom he portrayed as the organizer of the scheme -- "kept on badgering me for 
money. I just didn't want to continue doing what I was doing -- giving money 
for him to be quiet. . . . It was just getting to be too much." 
</P>
<P>
Rydzewski testified that, in a conversation around that time, Gieniec told him: 
"If I don't have $4,000 by tomorrow, the whole house of cards is going to 
fall." He said he refused to pay the money, hung up the phone and did not speak 
to Gieniec again for four years. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until 1987, after a tip from a security firm employee, that 
authorities began to unravel details of the alleged scheme, prosecutors have 
said. That led to charges in late May against Rydzewski, Gieniec and Tornberg.

COUNTY PANEL CONDEMNS ACOSTA FOR ANTI-GAY QUIP AFTER BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Human Relations Commission passed an emergency ordinance 
Thursday night unanimously condemning an anti-gay remark by Santa Ana City 
Councilman John Acosta after last weekend's volatile Gay Pride Festival. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also asked Acosta to publicly disavow violence against gays and 
lesbians, after a festival organizer complained about the councilman's public 
comments on violence that erupted at the festival, where six people were 
arrested after a wild fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Director Rusty Kennedy said the emergency action was an effort to 
defuse controversy that could be stirred by Acosta's remark in an interview 
with The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
<P>
Told of the commission's decision, Acosta said he never advocated violence 
against gays and lesbians. "If they want to read into the statement, there's 
nothing I could ever say that would change their minds. They are being so 
adamant about it." 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed after Sunday's brawl between militant gays and picketing 
fundamentalists at Centennial Regional Park, Acosta said: "I probably would 
have been in jail today for clobbering some of those . . . people." 
</P>
<P>
John J. Duran -- attorney for Orange County Cultural Pride, the organizing 
agency of the festival -- asked the commission to condemn that statement. Duran 
said that such a statement is equivalent to verbal gay-bashing and that it is 
inappropriate for a public official to condone violence. 
</P>
<P>
Human Relations Commissioner Daniel H. Ninburg said he was "flabbergasted" by 
Acosta's statement. 
</P>
<P>
"He should retract the statement in the best interest of the community," he 
said.

The emergency resolution adopted by the eight commission members in attendance 
Thursday reads: "The commission condemns as inflammatory the statement 
attributed to Councilman Acosta for its apparent endorsement of violence, and 
asks that he publicly disavow his reported statement and disavow violence 
against gays and lesbians as a method of expressing disagreement." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he will retract his remarks, Acosta said: "The gays have painted 
themselves as amiable people, but the fact remains the festival had a riot."

<P>
The 11-member commission was created in 1971 to resolve problems relating to 
prejudice, discrimination and disorder in human relations.

SUSPECT DOESN'T MATCH CLOTHES SLASHER SKETCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Police say a composite sketch has failed to determine whether a man arrested 
last week on suspicion of slashing designer clothes at several Los Angeles 
department stores is also the person sought in similar Orange County 
vandalisms. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach said they still have nothing that 
connects the Los Angeles man to the slashings of more than $50,000 in clothes 
at two county shopping malls this year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no hard evidence," Newport Beach police spokesman Robert Oakley said. 
"We don't have a witness to our crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Augusto Guzman, 38, was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of felony 
vandalism after a security officer at JW Robinson's in Northridge Fashion 
Center in the San Fernando Valley allegedly watched him walk through the 
department store with a razor blade in his hand and collect several items of 
clothing, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Oakley said police believe that Guzman is schizophrenic. The suspect will not 
say whether he has been to the county stores that reported slashed clothing, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't admit or deny being here," Oakley said. 
</P>
<P>
In one Newport Beach incident, at Forty Love in Newport Center Fashion Island, 
witnesses reported that a suspicious-looking man was in the store about the 
time that three Sergio Tacchini warm-up suits were found slashed, Oakley said. 
Police developed a composite drawing based on those accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know whether he (the man described by witnesses) was a suspect or 
not," Oakley said. "We don't even know if he was related to the incident." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the attacks in Los Angeles and Orange County were similar 
because in both areas a vandal hit a variety of shops. But the composite 
drawing of the Orange County suspect does not match a photograph of Guzman that 
Los Angeles Police sent to Newport Beach and Costa Mesa investigators, Oakley 
said.

PARENTS RECONSTRUCT CRASH THAT HURLED TOT FROM CAR; 
</P>
<P>
'IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two-year-old Adashia Jolviet and her newly acquired stuffed raccoon lay 
peacefully Thursday afternoon in a hospital bed, less than 24 hours after the 
toddler was thrown through the back window of her parents' car on the San Diego 
Freeway in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It all happened so fast, I can't even remember much of it," said Kim Jolviet, 
watching her daughter sleep at Long Beach Memorial Hospital. Tiny Adashia, only 
19 pounds, was reported in fair condition after her ordeal, suffering only some 
minor head and hand injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The family was coming home from Dove Canyon when a chartered bus carrying 22 
passengers to Los Angeles rear-ended their 1985 Volkswagen Jetta, which flipped 
over twice. 
</P>
<P>
Adashia, who was not in a child-restraining seat, was thrown out and landed 
near a back tire of the car after the vehicle rolled over and came up on its 
wheels. The impact broke out all the glass, and Adashia went flying through a 
back window. 
</P>
<P>
"We put her in the back with a seat belt on, thinking that that would be safe," 
Jolviet said. "She likes to sit back there and play with her building blocks 
and other toys she brings with her on long trips." 
</P>
<P>
The child's father, Robert Lee Williams, who was driving when the accident 
occurred, sustained minor head and hand injuries and was listed in good 
condition at Harbor General Hospital in Torrance. Kim Jolviet suffered only 
minor bruises. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all lucky to be alive," said Jolviet, who says she usually puts Adashia 
in a restraining seat. "The car seat was in my mother's car and we usually pick 
it up whenever we go somewhere in another car. This time we just didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Jolviet maintains though, that even with the safety seat, her 19-pound daughter 
would have been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"She is so small for her age that she slips out of everything," Jolviet said. 
"We adults both had on seat belts, but when the car rolled over we slipped out 
of them. Seat belts work best when the car isn't upside down." 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol reported that the accident occurred when Williams 
slowed his speed in the northbound car-pool lane in response to a CHP officer's 
warning that a stalled car was in the lane ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what the officer was trying to tell us, so we just slowed up," 
Jolviet said. "But the bus behind was going so fast that we knew he couldn't 
stop in time." 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the bus, Caren Vartgess, 44, will be cited for driving at an 
unsafe speed, while Adashia's parents will receive a citation for driving 
without a child safety seat, according to the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
Though the hospital has given Adashia a few new toys to replace those lost on 
the freeway, her favorite toy, a doll named Robin, isn't easily forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"She woke up during the night asking for her red-headed doll," Jolviet said. "I 
offered her the one the hospital gave her, but she shook her head and went back 
to sleep. That means she's still as stubborn as ever and hopefully OK." 
</P>

BRITO LEADS WESTERN PAST CYPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quarterback Gilbert Brito passed for one touchdown and added a 30-yard field 
goal to help Western High School to a 31-19 victory over Cypress in a nonleague 
football game Thursday in front of about 1,000 at Western. 
</P>
<P>
With Western trailing, 7-0, Brito passed 36 yards for a touchdown to running 
back Barry Howell on fourth and 12 with six minutes left in the first half. 
Brito's extra point tied the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
Brito kicked the 30-yard field goal with eight seconds left in the first half 
to give Western (1-1) a 10-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Western added short touchdown runs by Corey Manliguis and Dariel Whipple in the 
third quarter to take a 24-7 lead with 1:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress (1-1) made it close when quarterback Bobby Hubbard threw a pair of 
fourth-quarter passes for touchdowns to tight end Sean Gibson. They also teamed 
for a four-yard touchdown pass in the first half.

VILLA PARK'S DEFENSIVE TURNAROUND CONTINUES; 
</P>
<P>
SPARTANS GET FOUR SACKS, BEAT IRVINE, 17-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Defense, a sore subject for Coach Pat Mahoney last year, has become the 
backbone of the Villa Park High School football team. The only ones feeling any 
pain this season are the Spartans' opponents. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive week, Villa Park did not allow a touchdown. And for 
the second consecutive week, the Spartans came away winners, matching their 
1988 victory total. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park limited Irvine to 144 yards Thursday night in a 17-3 victory before 
800 spectators at El Modena High School. 
</P>
<P>
"We put $25,000 into our weight room during the off-season and we got the kids 
lifting more weights," Mahoney said. 
</P>
<P>
The extra work has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
After holding Bolsa Grande scoreless last week, Villa Park gave up only a 
32-yard field goal by Mark Huffman Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park gave up 20 or more points in four games last season, including 28 to 
Irvine. But the Spartans, who returned six starters on defense, appear to have 
learned from their mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (1-1) had only one scoring opportunity, driving 70 yards in 11 plays 
early in the fourth quarter. Shad Vickers did most of the work, including an 
18-yard run that gave the Vaqueros a first down on the Villa Park 18. 
</P>
<P>
But Villa Park's defense stiffened and Irvine had to settle for Huffman's field 
goal, which cut the Spartan lead to 10-3 with 8 minutes 40 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Vickers accounted for most of Irvine's offense. He had 94 yards rushing on 14 
carries and caught two passes for nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the team managed only 41 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we were going to be better on defense this year, but this season we've 
played beyond my expectations," Mahoney said. "We're attacking more this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine quarterback Vaughn Shackelford caught the brunt of that attack. He was 
sacked four times for 35 yards in losses. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Reed Neilsen had three of those sacks, one of which resulted in a 
fumble. Linebacker Mike Bass recovered at the Irvine 7, setting up a 32-yard 
field by Ted Burnette that gave the Spartans a 10-0 lead with 5:59 left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park's offense was unspectacular, but efficient. The Spartans played 
conservatively, alternating handoffs between three running backs. 
</P>
<P>
It was effective, as Villa Park gained 280 yards rushing. Gary Bladow had 106 
yards on 17 carries while sharing time at tailback with James Hong, who had 95 
yards on nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
After the scoreless first half, Villa Park drove 65 yards to open the third 
quarter. The Spartans ran the ball nine consecutive times on the drive, which 
ended with quarterback Jason Martian scoring on a 16-yard bootleg. 
</P>
<P>
After Huffman's field goal cut the deficit to 10-3, El Modena clinched the 
victory when Hong scored on a 40-yard touchdown run.

SHOCKLEY CAN'T DO EVERYTHING; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE HIS EFFORTS, PACIFICA LOSES, 12-7, TO HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Shockley was at quarterback. Chris Shockley played running back and Chris 
Schockley punted for Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
If only the Mariners could have had Shockley at tailback and quarterback at the 
same time Thursday. Then maybe he could have executed their option attack by 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, there just wasn't quite enough Shockley to go around. Though he 
rushed for 152 yards, Pacifica lost to Huntington Beach, 12-7, in front of 
1,000 at Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica was without starting quarterback Bobby Anderson, who was out with 
muscle spasms in his back. Shockley, normally the tailback, had to play some at 
quarterback because Anderson's backup, Chris Castellano, sprained his knee last 
week and mostly was limited to passing situations Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We wore him down," Huntington Beach Coach George Pascoe said. "Our defense 
played very, very well for the second week in a row." 
</P>
<P>
The offense was another story. Oiler quarterback Jeff Gibson's first pass was 
picked off by Mike Christie. The Oilers had to punt on their next four 
possessions and punter Matt Acocello had to chase one down that went over his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the second quarter, Huntington Beach took over on downs at its 47 after 
Shockley failed while trying to run for a first down from punt formation. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson completed a 20-yard pass to Doug Cunningham, a five-yarder to Jeff 
Dunagan, then a 28-yard touchdown pass to Chad Taylor with about a minute to 
play. The Oilers missed the conversion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Bret Clark fumbled the ensuing kickoff and the Oilers' David Roman recovered at 
the Pacifica 24. Two passes by Gibson put Huntington Beach on the three but in 
an attempt to stop the clock, Gibson was called for intentional grounding. With 
a second left in the half, Gibson stumbled out of the pocket and found Don 
Berger in the end zone for what proved to be the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson completed nine of 18 passes for two touchdowns, and 112 yards, 95 in the 
first half. He was intercepted twice. 
</P>
<P>
"(Our passing game) is going to be better," Pascoe said. "It's got to be 
better. We had guys one or two steps all night, we just didn't get the ball to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica came back with about four minutes remaining in the third quarter. In 
only four plays, the Mariners moved from their 37 into the end zone. Shockley 
ran for 33 of those yards in two carries and Castellano completed a 31-yard 
pass to Raul Banuelos before Shockley scored on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Castellano completed three of 15 passes for 76 yards and was intercepted twice.

MILLIKAN SEIZES MOMENT TO DEFEAT WESTMINSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After watching their team lose to Long Beach Millikan, 13-7, on Thursday night, 
Westminster High School fans may want to console themselves with a few good 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Westminster had its spurts . . . just not in the right spots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Westminster had a few great plays . . . but also a few too many lousy ones. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Westminster had Vance Senteno, who not only provided the Lions' touchdown 
but the most exhilarating moments of the game when he returned kickoffs 73 and 
70 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The problem? In the game's final moments, Senteno was in severe pain. Team 
physicians and trainers examined his left shoulder for a possible injury. 
</P>
<P>
Although the game got off to a rousing start on Senteno's 73-yard opening 
kickoff return and his seven-yard touchdown run three plays later, neither team 
managed much of a drive for the rest of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The second quarter was much the same, until Millikan capitalized on a 
Westminster mistake midway through the period. In what Westminster Coach Stan 
Clark called a severe breakdown in communications, the Lions opted to pass on a 
fourth-and-eight situation at their 10. 
</P>
<P>
When Westminster quarterback John Shipp's pass fell incomplete, Millikan only 
needed three running plays before Andre Borden scored easily on a one-yard run. 
But Millikan's extra-point attempt fell short, leaving Westminster with a 7-6 
lead. Although Senteno returned the ensuing kickoff 70 yards to the Millikan 
20, Westminster failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, both teams were sluggish at the start. But with four 
minutes remaining in the third quarter, Millikan's Keith Baker caught a punt, 
outwitted several tackles in running 65 yards along the sideline for a 
touchdown. The ensuing extra-point kick gave Millikan its final lead, 13-7. 
</P>
<P>
Although Shipp -- who in the first half did not complete a pass in four 
attempts -- finally found his groove in the fourth quarter, Westminster 
couldn't capitalize. He threw five consecutive completions, bringing the Lions 
to the Millikan 13. Four plays -- and no gain of yards -- later, Westminster 
turned over the ball on downs. 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't have been so bad had Westminster not repeated the process on its 
next possession. With less than three minutes to play, Shipp connected with 
Dave Spence on a 20-yard pass that put Westminster at the 11. But after an 
incomplete pass and two sacks for losses by Millikan tackle Lincoln Starks, 
Westminster turned over the ball on downs again.

EX-RAIDER MILLEN DECIDES NOT TO SWITCH, SO HE SIGNS WITH 49ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams lost another one to the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday when their 
rivals from the north signed linebacker Matt Millen, who was released by the 
Raiders last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were ready to sign Millen on Tuesday to play their unique nose 
tackle/linebacker position in the Eagle defense. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson said it was clear that Millen, when it came time to choose, 
wasn't ready to tackle a new position. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he expressed concern about it it being foreign or new," Robinson said. 
"I think the 49ers were looking at him as one of those linebackers that kind of 
get up in there and stuff the rush." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he would not pursue another linebacker now that Fred Strickland 
has returned to practice this week. Strickland underwent arthroscopic surgery 
on his right knee Aug. 8 and will return to the starting lineup Sunday against 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"Freddy's back," Robinson said. "I was most panicked that if something happened 
to Freddy, and (Larry) Kelm wasn't coming back, then we were in deep trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Strickland will not play "nosebacker" this week, though, the Rams figuring it 
would put too much pressure on the knee. He'll move to Larry Kelm's "Mack" 
position. Kelm is out again this week with a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
Will tailbacks Greg Bell and Eric Dickerson exchange greetings before Sunday's 
game? Will Dickerson apologize for calling Bell "that little dwarf" last 
season? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Bell's more afraid that Dickerson will bring up Bell's new two-year 
contract with the Rams. Bell will receive $450,000 this season and $475,000 in 
1990, far less than he sought during his summer holdout. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even have to shake his hand," Bell said. "He'll just look at me, and 
he'll be laughing at me . . . especially if he gets to look at me and say, 'I 
told you you wouldn't get anything (from Rams management).' I'll have to listen 
to that from him." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson said this week that Bell's contract doesn't concern him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's none of my business what he got," Dickerson said. "Whatever he gets, he 
gets. I don't know what he got. He must be happy, he's in camp." 
</P>
<P>
Bell added that he had no hard feelings toward Dickerson for his "dwarf" 
comment last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any bad blood about anyone," Bell said. "You can say anything in 
the world that you want. I'm going to live my life, I'm going to be happy. 
Heck, every day I read I still got an attitude problem, I'm on everybody's hate 
list. I'm going to continue my day whether anyone cares or not. I don't linger 
on bad press or bad vibes. That's for those who don't have a lot of self 
confidence. I got plenty of that." 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth, Bell out-gained Dickerson the first week, 128 yards to 
106. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two years after making the Dickerson trade, Colts General Manager Jimmy 
Irsay is still gloating. 
</P>
<P>
"When No. 29 runs out of the tunnel, it's hard to ever even think about being 
disappointed with the trade," Irsay told Indianapolis writers recently. "Also, 
you have to consider the progress that we have made after the trade. We got a 
tremendous player, and had the ability to add other great players. There was a 
lot of talk of us mortgaging the future, but we have created a very good team." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Larry Kelm has missed the past three games with a foot injury and 
won't play again this week. Coach John Robinson said the Rams would risk losing 
Kelm for the season if they tried to rush him back. "We're better off waiting 
for him to get well," Robinson said. "Injured players don't play well." . . . 
Safety Vince Newsome is expected to play Sunday despite a slight hamstring 
pull. Robinson said the safety may need some relief during the course of the 
game.

WOODBRIDGE MEET DRAWS TOP FIELD; 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY EVENT SATURDAY HAS BECOME THE LARGEST IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 high school cross-country teams are scheduled to compete Saturday 
in the Woodbridge Invitational at Woodbridge High School. 
</P>
<P>
The event has grown into the largest meet in Orange County, and the 
second-largest in the state behind the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational, 
according to George Varvas, the Woodbridge coach and meet director. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 athletes from 101 teams competed in last year's meet. This 
year, Varvas predicts an even larger field for the event that begins at 7:45 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we have 111 schools scheduled to compete," Varvas said. "And no 
other invitational or tournament brings together so many of the top-ranked 
teams." 
</P>
<P>
The meet is divided into three divisions based on school enrollment: small 
schools (less than 1,500 students), medium (1,500-2,000) and large (2,001 and 
more). Boys will run by class -- freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. 
Girls will run in freshman/sophomore, junior varsity and varsity divisions. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' division, top teams include Canyon Country Canyon, Santa Ana, 
Saddleback, San Clemente and Fountain Valley. Top individuals include Mike 
Farrell of San Clemente, Bryan Dameworth of Agoura and Rich Lockwood of 
Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Varvas said the girls' division includes most of the county's top teams, though 
the medium-schools division has the best competition. Agoura, Villa Park, 
Woodbridge, Tustin, El Toro and University are among the teams in that 
division. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' small-schools division, Newport Harbor, Yucaipa and Foothill are 
the teams to watch. 
</P>
<P>
The event is co-sponsored by the Newport-Irvine Rotary Club. BARBIE LUDOVISE

UPWARDLY MOBILE?;

MAZDA MAY JOIN HONDA, TOYOTA AND NISSAN IN RUN FOR THE LUXURY CAR MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember when Japanese cars meant something that was small, plain and cheap? 
</P>
<P>
The concept worked for Japanese automobile manufacturers in the United States. 
But they may have done their selling job a little too well. When those same 
manufacturers decided to enter the U.S. luxury car field, they found they 
needed new identities. 
</P>
<P>
Honda Motor Co. was the first to create a separate, top-of-the-line car 
division and dealership network with Acura. This month, Toyota Motor Corp.'s 
Lexus division officially opened, and Nissan Motor Co.'s new Infiniti division 
expects to introduce its first top-of-the-line models in November. 
</P>
<P>
The next to join the fray may be Mazda. The company's U.S. marketing arm, 
Irvine-based Mazda Motor of America Inc., announced last week that it is 
studying whether to establish a second dealer network for a luxury car line. 
</P>
<P>
If Mazda gives the green light to a separate distribution channel, it would be 
for a top-of-the-line model that almost certainly would have a distinctive name 
and identity, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy may provide Japanese car makers the image needed to attract 
well-to-do buyers who in the past have viewed their low-priced cars as 
workhorses for the hoi polloi. The drawback, however, is that the new ventures 
are riskier, have higher start-up costs, can take years to establish and are 
facing some dealer resistence in an increasingly glutted market. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be too many cars in the market," said Jim Slemons, an owner of six 
dealerships who turned down chances to sign on with Lexus and Infiniti. 
</P>
<P>
Slemons said a lot of dealers are not anxious to invest the $2 million to $5 
million it often takes to open a separate dealership for a new model. "They're 
afraid to come up with the big investment for one new car that might or might 
not sell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Slemons was one of the first Acura dealers in the country. At 
the time, Slemons was making a multimillion-dollar bet on an unknown name whose 
biggest selling point was that it was built by Honda, the star performer among 
Japanese auto makers. That distinction proved to be a key to Acura's success. 
</P>
<P>
With the new model, Honda was aiming to hang onto those consumers who had been 
happily driving its highly regarded vehicles, often referred to as "econoboxes" 
because of their good maintenance records, since their college days. As these 
satisfied customers got older, Honda reasoned, they would make more money -- 
and graduate to more expensive cars that reflected their success. 
</P>
<P>
With an estimated 13 million Americans now driving imports, what better way to 
keep Honda customers loyal than to provide a luxury model by a company already 
well-regarded for reliability? 
</P>
<P>
It was the same basic game plan that had paid off well previously for General 
Motors (with Cadillac) and Ford (with Lincoln). 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the strategy was a gamble. After all, in March, 1986 -- when the first 
Acura showrooms opened -- no one had ever sold Japanese cars in the $20,000 
price range. 
</P>
<P>
"Every now and then, we'd have somebody in the showroom who would say the Acura 
looked good and was incredibly reliable. Then they'd scratch their heads and 
say they still had a problem writing a $28,000 check for a Japanese car," said 
Bruce Edmondson, general manager of Canyon Acura in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
So Honda launched an intensive advertising campaign -- mimicked by dealers such 
as Slemons -- that touted the brand-new Acura as "from the new division of 
American Honda." 
</P>
<P>
But Honda still needed to avoid a collision course with its own stand-bys. So 
Acura dealers were required to invest in free-standing facilities with separate 
showrooms and service departments. A second ad agency was hired to come up with 
fresh concepts to tout the Acura. And at company headquarters, a new division 
was created for the upscale model. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to create a brand identity that competes with well-established 
nameplates like Mercedes, Cadillac, Lincoln and Jaguar, you have to come to the 
ballgame with the attributes that they offer -- and none of them have 
extensions of existing brands," said Bill Bruce, vice president and general 
manager of Nissan's Infinity division. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers in the luxury market are spending considerably more and don't like 
waiting in line. . . . And it takes a lot more to explain luxury cars," added 
Kurt von Zumwalt a spokesman for Toyota's Lexus Division. "The salesman has to 
justify to the customers why they're spending the amounts that they are." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lexus Followed Acura Lead 
</P>
<P>
So Lexus followed Acura's lead. When Lexus customers arrive, they see a 
receptionist in showrooms that looks as much like a corporate office as a car 
dealership. There are fewer cars on the floor than at similar dealerships with 
less pricey models. 
</P>
<P>
Such separate dealerships also provide another plus for manufacturers: Dealers 
are far more inclined to push a line of cars when it's the only one available 
in a showroom. 
</P>
<P>
While it is too early to gauge results for Lexus and Infiniti, setting up a 
separate Acura dealer network has worked very well indeed for Honda. 
</P>
<P>
Acura started slowly, opening with 60 dealerships in early 1986. By the end of 
that year, they had increased to 150 and had sold 52,860 cars -- meeting the 
company's projections. Acura now has nearly 300 dealers who last year sold 
128,238 luxury Legend and sporty Integra models -- which became the standard by 
which many consumers judge performance luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
Eyeing its competitors' success, Mazda has just named Richard Colliver to head 
a task force that will study whether the company wants to be the next to try to 
take on European auto makers with a new luxury line. No deadline for a decision 
has been set. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mazda Basks in Success 
</P>
<P>
The move comes at a time that Mazda, which sells imported and domestic-made 
cars and trucks through its 844 U.S. dealerships, is basking in the success of 
the Miata, its new two-seater roadster that has some car buyers in a bidding 
frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda has already entered the luxury competition with the 929, a mid-size 
luxury sedan listing for $23,300, and the 929-S, a more powerful, sportier 1990 
model that lists for $24,800. 
</P>
<P>
Sales have been slumping for the 929 -- which competes with the low-end models 
of Lexus, Infiniti and Acura. For the first eight months of 1989, sales of the 
929 have been off 22.7%, totaling only 14,076, compared to the same period a 
year ago when 18,217 cars were sold. 
</P>
<P>
If Mazda decides to set up a separate distribution channel, it could use a lot 
of the 929's basic engineering in a pricier model. And a new, luxury addition 
would make sense, automotive experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a separate, luxury brand to build true luxury cars. The 929 
is more of a near-luxury car," said Jesse Snyder, Los Angeles bureau chief for 
Automotive News, a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
Al Binder, managing editor of Detroit-based Ward's Automotive Report, added: 
"When Mazda decides to seriously compete with Lexus and Infiniti, they'll go 
the same route and establish a separate sales network with a unique product." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sizable Investment 
</P>
<P>
If the manufacturer does enter the luxury-import fray, one thing the task force 
will have to decide is whether dealers for the new line must open separate 
facilities. That strategy that would require a sizable, early investment in the 
dealerships, showrooms, real estate, inventory and operating capital. 
</P>
<P>
For some Acura dealers -- three years after the division was launched -- that 
capital outlay still has not been returned. Industry experts and dealers said 
that as many as half of Acura's dealerships are unprofitable. Honda officials 
discount that estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the financial squeeze on some dealers is related to 
their service operations. Consider that an estimated 67% of profits for the 
average import car dealership come from service. And Acuras -- which have only 
been on the road for three years -- have not yet required much repair. 
</P>
<P>
"Dealers are very reliant on parts and service," said Edmondson of Canyon 
Acura. "Sometimes over the last few years, (Acura's) service departments have 
been compared to the Maytag repairmen -- they have nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, even Acura -- which consistently tops independent measures of 
customer satisfaction -- still has some problems with name recognition. While 
more and more customers are familiar with Acura, "there's definitely still work 
to do," said one Acura dealer who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that -- at least in the initial years -- second dealer networks 
are riskier than rolling a new luxury line into an existing showroom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flat Luxury Car Sales 
</P>
<P>
That uncertainty -- combined with the realization that luxury car sales have 
been virtually flat in the past two years -- has caused some industry experts 
to wonder whether the market for new Japanese luxury lines is already too 
congested. 
</P>
<P>
After all, said Douglas K. Laughlin, automotive analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; 
Co., "If you're going to spend $35,000-plus on a car, most people would rather 
buy the real thing -- like a real Mercedes or a real BMW." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UPWARD MOBILITY 
</P>
<P>
As major Japanese automakers move into the luxury car arena, they are setting 
up separate dealership chains to market their upscale models.

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE

<TEXT>
<P>
Bank of America's Investment Real Estate Group is building a $12-million 
business park in Santa Ana for client Bay 511 Corp. of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
MacArthur Park will cover six acres with four buildings containing 94,000 
square feet of office and warehouse space. The bank bought the land from Cabot, 
Cabot &amp; Forbes in 1975 and has since managed the property for Bay 511. At 
the time, there was a Rockwell International warehouse on the site, which was 
recently demolished because it was outdated. 
</P>
<P>
The bank says land is so expensive in Orange County that few industrial 
buildings are being built, so it expects the new buildings to lease rapidly.

<P>
Calypso, jazz, surf instrumentals and pop are on tap for diners at the first 
Taste of Newport food festival opening today at Newport Center Fashion Island. 
</P>
<P>
Festival-goers can sample the wares of 40 Newport Beach restaurants while 
listening to the music, offered continuously during the three-day event to be 
held in a fenced area of the parking lot next to Atrium Court at Newport Center 
and Santa Rosa drives. 
</P>
<P>
The event is sponsored by Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce as part of 
'Newport SeaFest,' a 10-day offering of surfing contests, art shows, boat 
parades and other activities that runs through Sept. 24. Today's Taste of 
Newport music lineup features Billy Vera &amp; the Beaters. Vera is the Los 
Angeles popster who scored a hit in 1986 with the song "At This Moment" after 
it was featured on the television show "Family Ties." Singer Jeri Lynne, a 
regular at the Hop in Fountain Valley, will also perform. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventures, the instrumental guitar combo that made its first splash in 1960 
with "Walk Don't Run," will headline on Saturday, while drummer and jazz fusion 
pioneer Stix Hooper, a founding member of the Crusaders, heads the offerings 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Other jazz performers scheduled include Brian Bromberg, Eric Marienthal and 
Bulgarian pianist Milcho Leviev. Appearing twice Saturday will be the Trinidad 
and Tobago Showboat, featuring steel drum players, dancers and singers from the 
Caribbean republic. Also on Saturday, Tony Rossini will perform a tribute to 
Neil Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
Food samples and beverages can be purchased with scrip sold in $10 booklets; 
most items range from $1 to $3.

PERFORMANCE KALEIDOSCOPE ON THE GREEN; 
</P>
<P>
'DEEP THAW' PIECE WILL BE AMONG SCORES OF FREE ENTERTAINMENT BITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idea for "Deep Thaw" came to dancer-choreographer Nancy Lanier years before 
she knew that the work would have its debut at Sunday's sixth annual Arts on 
the Green in Costa Mesa. Nevertheless, the theme of the seven-minute piece is 
surprisingly similar to the one behind the free, daylong cultural celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The dance, like a spring thaw, "is nonstop motion from beginning to end," said 
Lanier, a member of the Lewitzky Dance Company in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And Arts on the Green, offering presentations by 56 Orange County dance, music 
and theater groups and exhibits by more than 70 visual artists at Town Center 
Park in Costa Mesa, is being described as a day of "continuous creativity." It 
runs Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"You can basically go from 11 in the morning to 6 at night, and there is 
something going on every single minute," said Carol Heywood, chairwoman of the 
arts committee for the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce, producer of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Groups large and small, as well as soloists, will perform on nine stages 
scattered through Town Center. The event is expected to draw 10,000 visitors, 
making it the largest festival to date, organizers said. Last year, about 8,000 
people attended. 
</P>
<P>
Musical offerings range from jazz to folk to classical and include performances 
by Opera Pacific, harpist Kathy Kavanaugh and a retrospective of '50s rock 'n' 
roll presented by the Hop nightclub in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Among theater groups scheduled are the Stop-Gap drama-therapy troupe, the 
Alternative Repertory Theatre and the Grove Shakespeare Festival. Ethnic dance 
-- including Polynesian, Japanese, Scottish and Spanish styles -- will be 
included, in addition to ballet, tap and modern dance. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, organized by the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce, has a $60,000 
budget, including $20,000 from Costa Mesa plus contributions from city 
businesses. Hands-on arts activities for children will also be offered. 
</P>
<P>
"Attending arts events can be fairly expensive," Heywood said. "So once a year, 
the community can come and spend a day availing themselves -- for free -- of 
many of the county's arts organizations." 
</P>
<P>
"Deep Thaw," commissioned by the Tustin-based Dance Kaleidoscope of Orange 
County, will be performed by six members of that 14-year-old company at 5:15 
p.m. It uses an original score composed in 1985 by San Francisco composer 
Gregory Ballard, whose "energetic piano and electronic" music prompted the 
piece, said Lanier, who lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to work with a flow of movement that was imitative of a spring thaw 
that eddied and flowed and changed its course and just kept going from start to 
finish," she said. "Physically, the dance has that kind of energy and power, 
but at the same time (the idea of) water allows you to yield and take the path 
of least resistance, and that is also evident in the choreography. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason for the work's unusual brevity, she said, "I think the 
point comes across in that amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason it is so short, she said, is because the dance is so "high 
energy" that the dancers had enough stamina to last just seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier, 32, who joined the Lewitzky troupe in 1983, said she has concentrated 
on performing rather than choreographing since then. Previously, she crafted 
dances in Utah and Michigan, where she received undergraduate and graduate 
degrees, respectively, in dance. 
</P>
<P>
She likes the idea of presenting her new work in the informal, outdoor arena of 
Arts on the Green: "When you first put a work out, you usually want to go back 
and make some changes and see how people react to it. So this is a great 
testing ground." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The free sixth annual Arts on the Green runs from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday at 
various locations Town Center Park, Costa Mesa. Information: (714) 650-1490.

NEW CHEF'S EFFORTS MUST VIE WITH VIEW FOR ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Max Jacobson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new chef at The Towers, Jackson Kenworth, has what you call credentials. He 
was trained at La Varenne in Paris, and then polished his skills at Spago with 
Wolfgang Puck. He comes to his new job from Citrus in Los Angeles, where he 
spent two years as executive chef under owner Michel Richard. 
</P>
<P>
Now, just as he's ready to step out on his own, he faces competition from an 
unexpected source: Nature. 
</P>
<P>
Every table in the Towers' ninth-floor dining room affords a magnificent view 
of the Laguna Beach coastline. Even the restaurant's decor, with its stunning 
Art Deco-style motifs, competes for attention with the kitchen. Any chef 
working this room needs to make a big splash. Kenworth does so. But that 
doesn't mean that things always go smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent lunch, for example, one of Kenworth's specialties -- corn soup with 
smoked bacon -- was thin and watery, with barely a trace of the smoky flavor 
I'd anticipated. Even less impressive was the tepid chicken salad with shiitake 
mushrooms. The greens were soggy with dressing, and the toppings had lost their 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
But there were bright spots. The warm short-rib terrine with vegetables and 
mustard vinaigrette showed imagination and dexterity. And a special dessert, 
frozen chocolate pave in a pool of sauce the chef calls coffee sabayon, was 
almost as impressive as the view. 
</P>
<P>
On my next visit to The Towers, five of us arrived for dinner on a quiet 
weekday evening, just in time to be treated to a remarkable sunset. It was a 
perfect moment; everyone in the restaurant fell silent and just stared off into 
eternity. I couldn't help feeling apprehensive for the chef. How do you follow 
that act? 
</P>
<P>
Things got off to a good start with a terrific pea soup with mussels (a scant 
two), and a velvety lobster bisque that was slightly above average (what it 
lacked in intensity it made up for in texture). 
</P>
<P>
Other appetizers weren't as good: A dish of home-cured salmon was notable for 
its presentation in bite-sized nubs, but was scarcely interesting. A grilled 
shrimp in a delicate herb sauce was somewhat better, but hardly extraordinary. 
And a salad of California greens with goat cheese croutons turned up with 
ordinary bread croutons that had cheese sitting on top of them like canapes at 
a catered office party. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the entrees arrived it had grown completely dark and the chef had 
our full attention. But the main courses got mixed reactions. Sea scallops, 
light as a mousse, were served with onion sauce and potato risotto (yes, potato 
risotto -- Kenworth got the dish from his Citrus repertoire). It was 
sensational. 
</P>
<P>
But in another main course, Maine lobster was almost as bad as the scallops 
were good. The lobster was rubbery and salty, the morels were barely 
reconstituted, and the saffron added nothing but distracting sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
There is a very nice rib-eye steak with bone marrow, however; mine would have 
been excellent had it not been for some injudicious overcooking. A lamb rack 
with fresh herbs also suffered from too much time on the stove; it came out 
medium well instead of medium rare. We also tried roasted duck with honey and 
cilantro, which proved to be a big mistake. The flavors were very subtle and 
pleasing, but the skin and meat were so fatty no one wanted a second bite. 
</P>
<P>
As for dessert, the pave I was served at lunch is about the only one worth the 
effort. Most are commercially produced offerings that the restaurant buys 
locally. We tried the opera cake, one of those multilayered affairs with lots 
of waxy chocolate, and mango mousse cake, which ran down the plate like a 
melted ice cream pie and tasted like a tin can. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lapses, Kenworth is a talented chef and the Towers is worth a visit 
on any beautiful day. Right now, however, he's going to have to settle for 
second billing . . . or move to a more circumspect dining room. 
</P>
<P>
The Towers is expensive. Appetizers run from $3.50 to $28, and main courses 
start at $19.50. Jackets are required for men after 5:30 p.m.

<P>
The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Hu, 315 S. Magnolia Ave., Anaheim. (714) 826-9910. Open Sundays and 
Tuesdays through Thursdays, 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays till 
10. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Hu doesn't compare with Chinese restaurants in Chinatown or the San Gabriel 
Valley, but that shouldn't put you off a visit. Just remember that the steamed 
fish might be frozen. Winter melon soup with shredded chicken is a masterwork, 
and the Sichuan shrimps are particularly fine. It's primarily a seafood 
restaurant but you may do just as well with the non-seafood items, such as the 
Peking spareribs or the mouth watering rice noodle dishes. Stay away from the 
retro-Chinese standbys like chop suey and egg foo young. They're awful. 
</P>
<P>
The Pleasant Peasant, 4251 Martingale Way, Newport Beach. (714) 955-2755. Open 
Mondays through Fridays, 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through Thursdays, 5:30 
p.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10. 
</P>
<P>
La Brasserie, 202 S. Main St., Orange. (714) 978-6161. Open Mondays through 
Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through Saturdays 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Country French cuisine has a huge audience, but many of the restaurants 
advertising it end up serving much fancier dishes instead. (They can charge 
more that way.) The Pleasant Peasant is reasonably priced, with both soup and 
salad included in the price of main courses. Stick to lamb and anything without 
sauce here. La Brasserie is a lot pricier but also considerably more 
accomplished. The coq au vin rouge is terrific, as is a wonderful homemade 
chicken liver mousse in aspic. Good desserts and plenty of romance here too. 
</P>
<P>
Salud, 17401 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 842-1194. Open Sundays 
through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Salud, a new, high-concept Mexican restaurant from Larry Cano, has an 
outlandish design that looks like a set Roger Corman might have used for a 
movie on Aztec discomania. All the trendy Mexican buttons are pushed: 
hand-shaken margaritas, '80s chilies, blue corn. Avoid the usual Meximush and 
head for soups, grilled meats and desserts. Pozole verde is hominy and shredded 
chicken in broth, and it's great. So is Ibarra chocolate bread pudding -- 
little cubes of fudge-soaked bread in a tequila orange cream sauce. Prices are 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Mongkut Thai, 212 Avenida del Mar, San Clemente. (714) 492-3871. 31976 S. Coast 
Highway, South Laguna. (714) 499-2100. Open Mondays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. 
to 3 p.m.; nightly 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 As well as being one of the current nicknames for Thailand, "Land of Smiles" 
could describe the type of service you can expect at the often exotic, 
occasionally bland Mongkut Thai restaurants where smiles substitute for 
intelligible English. Dishes get such flowery names as Glittering Coastal Onyx 
(sauced calamari) or Garnet Ocean Field (crab fried rice) on one of the most 
uniquely written menus anywhere, and they can be blistering hot. Curries like 
mussuman (beef) or an oily, flavorless chicken curry tend to disappoint, but 
most of the fare is exuberant and flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's Seafood Grill, 3330 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. (714) 979-2400. Open daily 
from 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's Seafood Grill made a killer impression on me the first time I ate 
there, but the year was 1976 and the city was San Francisco. That was then, 
this is now. Today, in a stunning new Coast Mesa location, the romance wears a 
bit thin. Good oysters, rich clam chowder and a good wine list make for 
pleasant beginnings but the fresh mesquite-grilled fish is often devoid of 
flavor, as one would expect in such a high-volume operation. Save room for the 
homemade desserts and the good espresso. 
</P>
<P>
Stix, 28251 Crown Valley Parkway at the Center at Ranch Miguel, Laguna Niguel. 
(714) 831-7849. Open 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. weekdays, 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Stix is a bright, airy, mirror-lined new Chinese restaurant where the cooking 
offers few surprises but is straightforward and safe: no MSG, high-quality oils 
like peanut and sesame, you get it. The various kung paos, pan fried dumplings 
and twice-cooked pork may lack the hotness and brio they have in Chinatown or 
Monterey Park, but added color and crunch make up for it. 
</P>
<P>
Gustaf Anders, (South Coast Plaza Village), 3610 S. Plaza Drive, Santa Ana. 
(714) 668-1737. Open daily, 11:30 a.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Gustaf Anders is a recent arrival from La Jolla, where it received critical 
raves from customers and critics alike. Here, in a beautiful setting, it fails 
to live up to its promise. Service is spotty and disorganized. The kitchen 
shows only occasional flashes of the brilliance for which Anders once was 
known. Chef Ulf Strandberg has a deft hand with smoked fish, pate, and salads. 
But his main dishes, such as the insipid deep fried sweetbread or too-sharp 
rabbit livers, are disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
Mayur, 2931 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. (714) 675-6622. Open Mondays 
through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 11:30 p.m.; Saturdays 5:30 
to 11:30 p.m.; Sundays noon to 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Breads like naan and aijwan paratha are perfect, steaming from the tandoor. 
Fish tikka comes dripping spice. Lamb vindaloo, a Goan preparation with 
vinegar, chili and potato, is hot, fragrant and well balanced. Be wary of the 
oily vegetable dishes and the unctuous service. 
</P>
<P>
Spaghettini, 3005 Old Ranch Parkway, Seal Beach. (213) 596-2199. Open Mondays 
through Z

The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, administered by the county Health 
Care Agency division of environmental health, responds to calls on chemical 
spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. Sometimes it goes to 
the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (departments, plus the county), 
three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through mutual aid 
agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county station in Irvine. 
Hazmat is called in most, but not all, incidents. Following is Hazmat's spill

Miami, Phoenix and San Francisco from Orange County, Los Angeles, Long Beach,

STYLE: 5 WOMEN SHARE BEST-DRESSED TIPS, FAVORITE DESIGNERS

County Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
What does it take to be well-dressed? Money, of course, helps. Connoisseur 
magazine claims it costs more than a million dollars per season to make the 
fashion industry's annual best-dressed list. And that doesn't include sport 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Those who don't flinch at pitching $10,000 toward a designer gown several times 
a season are usually considered pretty snappy dressers. 
</P>
<P>
But several of Orange County's arbiters of style say more important than money 
is developing an individual look and building a wardrobe around one's own 
personal style. Even those on a budget stress that by carefully choosing a few 
high-quality, versatile pieces, a woman can dress well without millions. 
</P>
<P>
We asked five women from several walks of life -- considered by many to be 
among the county's finest dressers -- what makes a woman well-dressed, what 
they like to buy and why. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maria Crutcher 
</P>
<P>
Recently named woman of the year by Orange County Magazine for her volunteer 
work (chairing the renowned Angelitos de Oro benefit fashion show three years 
in a row, for example), she says versatility is her fashion byword. 
</P>
<P>
But Crutcher, 77, doesn't claim to be on a budget. She readily acknowledges 
that she shops almost exclusively at Amen Wardy, the pricey, high-fashion 
boutique a stone's throw from her Big Canyon home. She is such a key customer, 
in fact, that she is often consulted on fashion by Wardy and has accompanied 
him on buying trips. 
</P>
<P>
Versatility is a key element in her fashion scope because it makes dressing 
easier. One of her favorite fall outfits is an Oscar de la Renta black-wool 
sheath that can be worn with an endless assortment of accessories. 
</P>
<P>
The simple black dress, a good shade for Crutcher's coloring of pink skin tones 
and gray hair, can be dressed up with jewels or dressed down with a casual 
jacket. Last week, she wore it with half a dozen David Webb jewelry pieces, 
setting off the black in a blaze of gold. She owns several short Amen Wardy 
jackets that put an entirely different spin on the basic black. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll find that women today want to be very versatile in their 
clothes and to be able to go through the whole day and into the evening by only 
changing a few accessories," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Her favorite designers are Galanos, Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta, Bob Mackie 
for evening, Valentino and Odicini, names that crowd her closets. Reaching into 
her wardrobe, Crutcher pulls out an armload of Galanos suits, many in black and 
white stripes or checks. Amid the Tiffany boxes and Judith Leiber bags are 
several Valentino suits, Bill Blass ensembles and Amen Wardy private label 
jackets that can be mixed and matched. 
</P>
<P>
So far this fall, she has purchased a two-piece black leather suit with 
simulated alligator skirt and silk blouse made in Italy for Amen Wardy, and a 
black Oscar de la Renta evening gown of velvet skirt and draped chiffon top for 
the upcoming holiday parties. 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy is to add a few good pieces for every season," she says. "Try to 
make your wardrobe so it is flexible for any occasion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lydia Wang Himes 
</P>
<P>
President of the Historical and Cultural Foundation of Orange County, she calls 
herself an eclectic dresser. As a commercial interior designer who grew up in 
Hong Kong, Himes prefers clean lines in both her clothes and her work. She 
favors unconstructed suits, uncluttered by patterns or accessories. 
</P>
<P>
"I like good details, I'm not into a lot of drippy scarfs and necklaces but 
rather well-cut clothes," she says. She will swing from slightly avant-garde to 
traditional Chinese dress as long as the look is not overly tailored or severe. 
She likes unique, feminine clothes and counts Valentino, Issey Miyake and 
Ungaro among her favorite designers. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in my profession, I can get away with a little more freedom," she says. 
"I like unusual things that no one else is wearing." 
</P>
<P>
Himes -- a member of the Angels of the Arts and a trustee of South Coast 
Repertory, as well as owner-founder of Lydia Wang and Associates in Costa Mesa 
-- needs an assortment of comfortable outfits that travel from the drafting 
board to the concert hall with ease. 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy in dress is that you have to be very comfortable with your look 
and your body," she says. "You have to dress to please yourself. If you're 
comfortable with your look, you'll look good." 
</P>
<P>
This fall, she will be searching for work clothes at her favorite place to 
shop, the designer department of Nordstrom, South Coast Plaza. And she says she 
has something very special to wear to Saturday night's South Coast Repertory 
Annual Gala. She won't say what it is. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rusty Hood 
</P>
<P>
"I never (decide) what I'm wearing until I'm in the shower," says the chairman 
of the board of the Phoenix House (Orange County) drug rehabilitation program. 
"That's why I like to have things in the closet, so I don't have to plan 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Hood, like Himes, emphasizes the importance of knowing one's best look and 
building a wardrobe around it. 
</P>
<P>
"I choose designers to fit my body," says the 59-year-old resident of Lido 
Isle. "I love Anne Klein, but not on someone 5-foot-4." 
</P>
<P>
She says Valentino and Ungaro are good styles for her frame and personality. 
She also loves Escada, Mondi and Patrick Kelly. For evening, she prefers 
Valentino, Ungaro and Oscar de la Renta, names easily found at her favorite 
places to shop, Amen Wardy and Neiman Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
"I will wear anybody. I'm not bound by labels; it's just that these are the 
designers I try on first," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Hood, dressed in a two-piece yellow and white cotton Ungaro luncheon suit, 
describes her personal style as tailored and sophisticated ("far-out is not 
me"). As a former dress manufacturer, she is always aware of construction, 
workmanship and fabric. 
</P>
<P>
"I always look inside a dress to see how it's made," she says. "I guess I'm 
what people call an investment dresser. I buy good quality . . . and I keep my 
clothes." 
</P>
<P>
For fall, she has bought two new leather suits, a buttery, marigold-colored 
Ellen Tracy suede bomber jacket and a vibrant-colored Patrick Kelly wool dress. 
She is considering a Gianni Versace two-piece dress with draping around the 
waist and an Escada silk blouse and pant outfit. This season's big colors -- 
greens, rusts and golds -- are perfect for her reddish-gold hair and fair skin, 
she adds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Betty R. Moss 
</P>
<P>
"Simplicity is what I go for," says the former model and current executive 
director of the nonprofit Orange County Business Committee for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that knowing one's own personality and style is the most important 
thing (in dressing well), and understated is the right look for me," says Moss, 
who has lived in Santa Ana for 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
Her favorite designers, Anne Klein, Calvin Klein and Adrienne Vittadini, are 
chosen for their luxurious fabrics and tailored, neat lines. 
</P>
<P>
"The one I like but can't afford is Chanel, probably the designer I've liked 
best since the early '50s." 
</P>
<P>
Moss' philosophy on fashion is to choose classic, understated designs that will 
stay in style for years. 
</P>
<P>
"One doesn't have to have a tremendous budget to dress well, if the choices are 
classic, basic styles and things of good quality," she says. "Look at women who 
can afford the finest classic designer clothes and you see they wear them for 
20 or 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Best colors for Moss, who has blond hair and green eyes, are black, ecru, red 
and white, tones chosen as much for their versatility as well as for their 
compatibility with her hair and skin. 
</P>
<P>
She just returned from a trip and hasn't had time to shop for fall but says she 
will soon be browsing her regular haunts -- South Coast Plaza (especially 
Nordstrom), Neiman Marcus and Bullocks Wilshire -- for a new black or red suit 
she can wear during the day and into the evening. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a Wardy," says Moss, referring to the Fashion Island boutique. "I shop 
sales or if I see something I want, I wait until it goes on sale." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Margie Shackelford 
</P>
<P>
Creativity is the key to dressing well, says the director of development and 
public relations for the Newport Harbor Art Museum. Shackelford, 56, believes 
women should be choosy in selecting what is promoted by the fashion industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The smart woman adapts a new fashion to her own style of dressing, but doesn't 
go out and buy THE hot item of the year," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Shackelford likes the sophisticated styles of Donna Karan, Calvin Klein and 
Ronaldus Shamask and prefers the neutral tones of black, beige and brown. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been comfortable with a lot of color," says the 5-foot-5-inch 
blonde. "I don't want anything to detract from me as a person and I don't want 
my clothes to (outshine) my personality." 
</P>
<P>
The Dana Point resident favors suits for work and evening and this fall has 
chosen a two-piece gray Shamask suit with wide-legged pants and jacket in wool 
gabardine. It illustrates her style perfectly: sophisticated but not frilly. 
</P>
<P>
Like a lot of busy career women, Shackelford doesn't have much time to shop or 
think about fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"I get up very early and don't have time to make a lot of decisions on what I'm 
going to wear," she says. "You can always put on a pair of black pants and a 
black and white jacket and look terrific. I want to look terrific but I don't 
want to have to think about it."

ANN CONWAY: LACKING LEADER AND NEW BLOOD, 'GOURMET GALA' IS CALLED OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The death of a gala. 
</P>
<P>
Not a pretty subject. But this year's "Gourmet Gala," for the past three years 
one of the county's de rigueur mega-bashes, was recently laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
No sooner did the invitations arrive than the Sept. 23 event at the Irvine 
Hilton and Towers was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Who's to blame? No one will claim it. Not the staff at the March of Dimes Birth 
Defects Foundation in Costa Mesa. Not the woman who brought it to Orange County 
from the March of Dimes headquarters in New York. Not the woman who chaired it 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, we know it takes a strong social type to attract a crowd," 
says Phil Beukema, director of the Costa Mesa chapter. "And this year we 
couldn't find a chairwoman. So, we convened a committee of people who wanted to 
help us pull it together, and it just didn't come off." 
</P>
<P>
The first gala was chaired by developer Kathryn Thompson, who was invited by 
bigwigs at the March of Dimes headquarters in New York to bring the event to 
Orange County (the gala is staged in many of the country's social capitals). 
Thompson had social clout of major proportions, and New York knew it. The next 
year, developer Bill Lusk of Newport Beach, a man loaded with socio-business 
connections, took the helm. Last year, Newport Beach social activist Mary Ann 
Miller carried the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The next step, says Thompson, was for Miller to "promote the chairmanship for 
the following year." 
</P>
<P>
And Miller did. But the "Gourmet Gala" has an overwhelming workload. Its 
chairperson must bring in a dozen chefs to whip up fare in a dozen 
theme-decorated booths. The chairperson must bring in top interior designers to 
decorate those booths. Then, there's the food judging to line up -- the food 
critics who are brought in from around the world. And the cocktail reception, 
the sit-down gourmet dinner, the food judging, the entertainment, the dancing. 
</P>
<P>
When Miller got on the phone and started to call the "who's who" of local gala 
giving, she came up with zero. 
</P>
<P>
"One woman couldn't do it because she was pregnant," Miller says. "Another said 
she'd do it if she could ask a certain business to sponsor it. But her husband 
asked her not to approach that company this year." Another had just signed up 
to chair another benefit. 
</P>
<P>
And Miller was unwilling to take on the gala again. 
</P>
<P>
"I was booth design chairman for the gala for two years before I chaired it," 
she said. "It was time for me to move on, time for new blood." 
</P>
<P>
But the new blood, or even the old for that matter, did not step forward. 
</P>
<P>
What's a gala to do? Miller is working with the March of Dimes to develop a 
network so that a guild, not just one person, will organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Miller, who is known for keeping her social ear to the ground, says: 
"There's a change going on out there. A big change. I think a lot of the 
charities are thinking about restructuring. They are getting more realistic 
about what they can expect. There have been a lot of fad parties, galas where 
we all hopped on the bandwagon because they were fun. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, there are so many charities we are all taking a second look and just 
going to those events we are really committed to. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some attrition going on. You're not going to see the same women 
chairing the same balls. They're worn out. They've been doing it over and over. 
There simply has to be some new blood." 
</P>
<P>
The reason newcomers are reluctant, Miller says, may be that they're not as 
connected as her social peers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the community for 25 years," she says. "I can get on the phone 
and call somebody for financial support or their connections because they know 
I'm somebody they can count on." 
</P>
<P>
And what does new blood do, if it has no connections? 
</P>
<P>
"Begin like we all did, years ago," Miller says. "Start with a letter. I don't 
like to call somebody cold and ask them for something. 
</P>
<P>
"A letter opens the door a crack. They toss the letter in the trash, but it 
sticks in their brain. Then you call them on the phone, ask them, 'What help 
can you give?' " 
</P>
<P>
Thompson confesses she is "very sad" about the gala being canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was an event everyone enjoyed," she says. "I guess it's a lesson 
Orange County needs to learn. Galas don't just happen. They take a lot of work 
by a strong chairperson and a strong committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's peer-to-peer pressure that makes them happen. Let's say, for instance, I 
call William Lyon and ask him to buy a table at a gala that I'm going to chair. 
</P>
<P>
"He is hard-put to say no, because he knows he'll probably be calling me next 
week to ask me the same thing."

SINGING A NEW TUNE; 
</P>
<P>
MAURICE ALLARD, A MASTER OF ADULT CHORUSES, NOW DRAWS OUT THE SONG OF A CHILD'S 
SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until his run-in with a bunch of professional "street urchins," Maurice Allard 
pretty much hung out exclusively with sopranos, altos, tenors and basses. 
</P>
<P>
As conductor of choruses at UC Irvine and music director of the Master Chorale 
of Orange County, Allard had spent most of his career hearing and shaping the 
separate and distinct sounds of adult voices. 
</P>
<P>
But several nights spent working with a young opera chorus outside the mythical 
Cafe Momus in 1987 convinced him that a part of his musical future should be 
with singers whose voices have not yet changed. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he had been working temporarily with Opera Pacific as chorus 
master for the company's production of Puccini's "La Boheme." He had not yet 
submitted his resignation as musical director of the Master Chorale; that would 
come in October of that year. 
</P>
<P>
The "La Boheme" chorus made brief appearances in the opera, first as part of 
the Paris street scene outside the Cafe Momus in Act II and then again at the 
beginning of Act III. 
</P>
<P>
"They were marvelous and so receptive, and I just loved working with them," 
Allard said of the children playing the street urchins. "I've always been a 
teacher and always been comfortable teaching, and I figured I'd just treat them 
like adults, and they responded to that. It was a brand new idea for me." 
</P>
<P>
Allard has used that approach as the basis for his Allard Academy, a 
multidisciplinary school of performing arts intended mainly for children 14 and 
younger. The school offers 21 classes in singing, acting, musical theater and 
basic music and movement taught by six staff teachers supervised by Allard. 
</P>
<P>
Allard said there are nearly 200 students enrolled, ranging in age from 2 to 
14, plus a few who are older. 
</P>
<P>
Those ages 2 through 5 attend their Allard classes in music and movement at the 
Newport Ballet Academy in Costa Mesa. In these, the children participate in 
movement exercises and singing and are introduced to the basics of keyboard and 
other simple musical instruments. Classes for children older than 5 are taught 
at the Fred Astaire Dance Studio and Linda's Dance Studio, both in Costa Mesa. 
In these, they learn the basics of performing in musical theater. 
</P>
<P>
Allard himself, as part of the academy curriculum, teaches 20 private voice 
students from 9 to 14 years old in his Costa Mesa home. 
</P>
<P>
None of it comes cheaply. Allard's private weekly voice classes cost $125 a 
month. Two months of weekly academy music theater classes are priced at $325 
for children 5 to 8 years, the "Broadway Revue" classes for children 9 to 14 
are $395 and the "Young Professionals" classes for children 15 and older are 
$395. Beginning and intermediate acting classes cost $375 for two months of 
weekly sessions. Ten sessions of music and movement classes are $85. Those 
students chosen by Allard to join the Allard Singers -- a new regional touring 
and performing group -- are charged $395 each for two months of weekly 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Allard also conducts a weekly adult voice class in his home, but, he said, he 
is more devoted to carrying out an old axiom of musical instruction: Get 'em 
while they're young. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that if I could get them early enough and train them properly that 
they wouldn't have the problems that some adults have," Allard said of his 
philosophy of teaching singers. "I have this one 5-year-old boy who knows he 
wants to be a singer, and he can get right up and sing now. At parties, he just 
gets up and sings. It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Allard said that although much of his career has centered on conducting and 
performing, "I've never stopped teaching singing. I've taught it for 38 years, 
both privately and at the university level. (The academy) evolved out of my 
passion for teaching, which is the thing I enjoy doing most." 
</P>
<P>
The other disciplines taught through the academy became part of the curriculum 
partly as a result of Allard's own professional diversification after he left 
the Master Chorale. He began serving as the host of an arts talk show on local 
cable TV, writing musical criticism and, last year, studying acting with 
Lynette Katselas, a Hollywood coach who now teaches at his academy. 
</P>
<P>
He has since landed a role in a credit card commercial that "paid well and sort 
of inspired me." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a million irons in the fire now," he said. "I'm doing a lot of 
offbeat things that I've never done before, and I just love it. The acting is 
something very new. Performing was never a problem for me, but straight acting 
is more complicated." 
</P>
<P>
A return to conducting a large chorus is not in his plans, Allard said, 
although he did say that a smaller vocal ensemble under his direction is "in 
the works." 
</P>
<P>
When Allard left the Master Chorale -- over what he said was a dispute with the 
chorale board of directors about the direction of the ensemble and its 
pops-oriented subgroup, the Californians -- he decided that he "wanted to get 
out of the public eye. The pressure of PR and fund raising became a little too 
much for me. I got burned out with all the fringe activities it takes. I'm 
busier than I've ever been now, but I can control my time." 
</P>
<P>
A good part of that time is now spent helping children improve upon something 
they do naturally, Allard said. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard Bernstein said that every person is born with a song in his soul," 
Allard said. "But over the course of time it gets programmed out. I love what 
I'm doing now. You'd be amazed how many kids just love to get up and sing."

STING'S 'THREEPENNY OPERA': A 'DUD'

Rock star Sting suffered the slings and arrows of outraged theater critics 
today for his stage debut in "The Threepenny Opera," but he was a smash hit 
with Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin and Yulia Sukhanova, the Soviet Union's 
first beauty queen. 
</P>
<P>
With President and Mrs. Bush watching from box seats above the National Theater 
stage Thursday night, Sting made the best of a daunting, three-hour performance 
as Mack the Knife in the pre-Broadway premiere of Bertolt Brecht's biting 
musical satire. 
</P>
<P>
The critics, however, agreed that Sting's best wasn't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Slow and turgid stuff," complained the Washington Post's David Richards, who 
said Sting's "acting has little resonance and his singing voice is surprisingly 
thin." 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to see Sting, prepare to be stung," said Hap Erstein of The 
Washington Times, who said this "Threepenny Opera" proved "to not be worth 2 
cents."

The Philippine Supreme Court today narrowly upheld a government decision 
barring former President Ferdinand E. Marcos from returning to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
It voted 8 to 7 to dismiss a petition by the deposed ruler seeking to return 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"(President Corazon Aquino) did not act arbitrarily or with grave abuse of 
discretion in determining that the return of Marcos and his family . . . poses 
a serious threat to national interest and welfare," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, 72, overthrown in February, 1986, and now in critical condition in a 
Honolulu hospital, has repeatedly asked Aquino to let him come home to die. 
Aquino has barred his return, dead or alive, for security reasons.

Valentina Nicholaevna Sanana Schlee, who under the professional name Valentina 
became one of the best-known designers of high-fashion clothes in the 1940s and 
1950s, died Thursday, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Valentina, 90, died at her Manhattan apartment of Parkinson's disease, the New 
York Times said. 
</P>
<P>
She was the widow of George Schlee, the financier who served as her business 
partner and as an adviser to Greta Garbo, who was one of Valentina's notable 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Valentina also designed clothes for such show business personalities as 
Katharine Hepburn, Mary Martin, Gloria Swanson and Gertrude Lawrence, Paulette 
Goddard, Rosalind Russell and Norma Shearer. 
</P>
<P>
She was born in Kiev and was fleeing the country at the time of the revolution 
when she met her future husband at the railroad station in the Black Sea port 
of Sevastopol. After they were married, they lived in Athens, Rome and Paris 
before coming to America in 1923.

WRITER ROBERT PENN WARREN DIES;

<P>
FIRST U.S. POET LAUREATE, 84, HAD WON 3 PULITZER PRIZES

Robert Penn Warren, winner of three Pulitzer Prizes for fiction and poetry 
rooted in his native South and the nation's first poet laureate, died early 
today at his summer home. He was 84 and had been suffering from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, the author Eleanor Clark, told a family friend that Warren died in 
the middle of the night. A local doctor was with him, as well as Clark and 
their daughter, Rosanna. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the truly all-around men who made great contributions in all 
fields. He was a great poet, fine teacher and did something to revolutionize 
the modes of teaching literature," said Cleanth Brooks, who with Warren 
developed what came to be known as the "New Criticism." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Guthrie, Ky., on April 24, 1905, Warren grew up hearing tales of the 
Civil War from his two grandfathers who had been Confederate soldiers, but he 
lived the last three decades of his life in New England. 
</P>
<P>
Before his second marriage, to Clark, she had suggested that they return to the 
South so that their children would know his world. 
</P>
<P>
"But I discovered it wasn't the same world," Warren once said. "I had been 
carrying a dream around in my head." 
</P>
<P>
In the same way, he said that "All the King's Men" was not about Huey Long, but 
about the myth of the swaggering populist governor of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
The novel, his greatest success in fiction, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 and 
became an Academy Award-winning motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
Warren was the first winner of Pulitzer Prizes in both poetry and fiction. The 
poetry prizes came in 1957 for "Promises: Poems 1954-1956," and in 1979 for 
"Now and Then: Poems 1976-1978." 
</P>
<P>
He also was among the first recipients of the MacArthur Foundation's 
unrestricted "genius grants."

He was appointed poet laureate in 1986, assuming a largely ceremonial title 
that Congress had tacked on to the post of consultant in poetry to the Library 
of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who create these posts don't give a damn about poetry," Warren said 
of the appointment. "They do it because it's a nice thing to do. They think 
'There's a poet down the road; let's make him a poet laureate.' " 
</P>
<P>
Entering Vanderbilt University in 1921 intending to study science, Warren found 
that his science teachers were not as good as his English teachers, who 
included John Crowe Ransom and Donald Davidson, both members of the "Fugitive 
Group" of poets in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
The Fugitives thought of the South as having a distinct regional identity, more 
rural than urban, politically conservative and bound by blood-kinship, 
although, Warren stressed, "everybody had his own idea" about what the South 
was.

Bombs damaged five banks in northern Bogota early today, blowing out windows 
and wounding one guard in the first explosions to shatter a 10-day bombing lull 
in the Colombian capital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
One bomb, made up of 22 pounds of dynamite and placed at a shopping center, 
damaged four banks and blew out windows in nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
Another bomb, going off simultaneously in another district, blew out windows of 
a branch of a state bank, wounding a guard and breaking windows in nearby 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 bombs have rocked the northern city of Medellin, Colombia's cocaine 
capital, since "the Extraditables," a drug-linked group, declared war on the 
Colombian Establishment Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign was in response to the government's unprecedented anti-narcotics 
crackdown launched six days earlier. Bogota has been the scene of three 
bombings since the crackdown began.

Former President Ronald Reagan left the hospital today, tipping his hat to 
well-wishers and revealing a shaved spot on his head where Mayo Clinic 
physicians performed skull surgery a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, 78, and his wife, Nancy, flew back home to Los Angeles aboard a 
privately owned DC-9 jet. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people, many of them travelers at the Rochester airport, gathered as 
the Rochester Lourdes High School marching band played while Reagan said goodby 
to Mayo Clinic officials and to retired Mayo physician, Dr. Oliver Beahrs. 
</P>
<P>
Beahrs, a friend of Nancy Reagan's late father, who also was a physician, said 
Reagan was returning home in good health. Doctors last Friday drained fluid 
that had built up on Reagan's brain after he was thrown from a horse on July 4.

U.S. NOT 'NIGGARDLY' ON SOVIET REFUGEES, STATE DEPT. DECLARES

<P>
A senior State Department official today vigorously denied that the Bush 
Administration is being "niggardly" in setting a new policy on dealing with 
thousands of Soviet refugees seeking entry into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The official, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, also suggested 
that Western Europe, Canada and Australia could do more to help ease the burden 
on the United States by taking in more refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee after 
Administration officials had been subjected to withering attack by a House 
Judiciary subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Congressmen had said that plans to cope with an increasing flood of Soviet Jews 
and others now able to leave the country under Moscow's liberalized emigration 
policies were inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"I resent the implication (in the House and in the press) that we have some 
heartless, niggardly, conservative approach to the problem," Eagleburger said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to Be Generous 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is trying to be as generous as possible. But he said 
U.S. resources are limited, adding that other countries also have an obligation 
to accept some of the refugees. He specified Western European nations, Canada 
and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
He said that there is a new era in Soviet emigration and that it has never been 
claimed that the United States has an obligation to accept everyone who wants 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is proposing to admit 50,000 Soviet refugees in the year 
starting Oct. 1, out of total admissions of 125,000 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet total, however, is already exceeded by the number of Jews and others 
who have applied for refugee status and officials say that up to 150,000 more 
may seek to leave next year. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger said the Administration's first aim is to clear the backlog of 
Soviet citizens who have already left the Soviet Union and are waiting in camps 
in Vienna and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simpson Hits 'Gimmickry' 
</P>
<P>
He said none of the thousands of refugees stalled in a camp outside of Rome 
will be denied entry. The camp cost the United States $34 million in the 
current fiscal year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Oct. 1, the United States will no longer give refugee status to Jews who 
leave the Soviet Union on Israeli visas and then opt to come to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, applications will be processed only at the U.S. Embassy in 
Moscow, backed up by a special office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In statements out of step with those of other committee members, Sen. Alan K. 
Simpson (R-Wyo.) criticized the "gimmickry" of a refugee admission system that 
gives priority to Soviet refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting case-by-case decisions on refugees rather than automatic granting of 
refugee status, he said, "It's unconscionable to me to jump to the head of the 
line persons who are not refugees, not to mention providing them all the 
benefits they receive which immigrants do not now receive."

The Senate today overwhelmingly approved a $7.7-billion fiscal 1990 spending 
bill that makes wholesale cuts in President Bush's budget request for military 
construction in the Philippines and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 93 to 1 that came after less than an hour of debate, the Senate 
adopted a spending bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 that is $1.3 
billion less than this year's level and about $300 million less than Bush's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the legislation eliminates the $40.8 million Bush requested for 
the Philippines and cuts $85.5 million from the $86.3 million for South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to make our defense dollar go further is to secure a more 
equitable burden sharing from our allies," said Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), 
chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on military construction.

Exxon will have to come back in the spring to finish cleaning up after its 
massive Alaska oil spill and "they'll do what we tell them to do," the Coast 
Guard commandant said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The job is not done and it is going to have to be finished up next year," Adm. 
Paul Yost said of the March 24 spill on ABC's "Good Morning America." 
</P>
<P>
A White House spokesman said, "We expect Exxon to live up to its commitment. If 
that means going back in the spring, we expect them to go back in the spring." 
</P>
<P>
Yost said Exxon underestimated the cleanup work by 20% "and they need to come 
up there in the spring." 
</P>
<P>
"Between what Exxon has done and will do we're going to have an area that's 
recovered in a few years," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on the NBC "Today" show this morning, Dennis Kelso, Alaska 
commissioner of environmental conservation, said that "the shoreline is not 
clean now." 
</P>
<P>
"Treatment is not the same as cleaning and in fact we have a long way to go," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be working over the winter. We think Exxon should join us and we 
need to have Exxon committed to come back this spring." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Thursday in Valdez, Alaska, an Exxon spokesman called its 
six-month cleanup almost a complete success.

Billionaire investor Marvin Davis today said he will match a $6.75-billion 
buyout offer by pilots and managers of United Airlines that has been approved 
by parent UAL Corp., should the pilot-management bid fall through. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said any bidder competing with the pilots and managers is at a 
"clear competitive disadvantage," Davis said he is ready to pay $300 a share -- 
without requiring any labor concessions -- if the employee-management bid is 
not completed. 
</P>
<P>
UAL opened $2.75 a share higher at $283.25 today on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, UAL Corp.'s directors approved a $300-a-share, or $6.75-billion, 
offer from the management-pilot group, which could result in the nation's 
largest employee-owned company. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which includes a no-strike guarantee by the pilots and other 
cost-cutting labor concessions, was the latest twist in a 6-week takeover 
battle.

Air France and West Germany's Lufthansa agreed today to cooperate on everything 
from catering to aircraft purchases in a move designed to better prepare the 
world's two biggest airlines for the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"Both companies know that to face up to the competition, we have to adapt," 
said Air France Chairman Bernard Attali. 
</P>
<P>
State-owned Lufthansa and Air France rank second and third in the world 
respectively in terms of passengers carried on international flights. British 
Airways is the largest. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the deal Attali signed with Lufthansa Chairman Heinz Ruhnau, 
each airline will maintain its separate identity and continue to compete for 
most routes. But they will extend existing cooperation agreements -- including 
reservation systems, aircraft maintenance and flights to West Berlin -- to 
cover a wide spectrum of joint services.

A judge fined an attorney $10,000 for failing to produce New York Yankees 
outfielder Dave Winfield for a deposition concerning his divorce case. 
</P>
<P>
State District Judge Allen J. Daggett also fined Houston attorney Tom Alexander 
$1,000 Thursday for not paying a $250 fine after Winfield's failure to appear 
for a deposition Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
A jury ruled in June that Winfield had a common-law marriage with Houston 
flight attendant Sandra Renfro from 1982 to 1985. Winfield maintained that he 
never intended to marry Renfro. The couple's divorce trial was scheduled to 
begin in Daggett's court Sept. 2, but it has been delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Renfro's attorney, Earle Lilly, said Winfield failed to appear for the 
deposition to avoid being served contempt papers for not paying his client 
$10,000 a month in temporary alimony.

Denver Broncos Coach Dan Reeves has imposed a first-ever 1 a.m. curfew on his 
team, saying he is "irritated as heck" about his players' recent run-ins with 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
He said Thursday that any Broncos player seen in public after 1 a.m. faces 
disciplinary action, and any player ticketed for an alcohol- or drug-related 
offense will be suspended without pay for at least one game. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, two Broncos players had run-ins with Denver-area police. Starting 
tackle Gerald Perry, who was acquitted of a rape charge this summer, consented 
to undergo counseling after police found him with a prostitute at Perry's 
parked car on a Denver street. Later in the week, starting tight end Clarence 
Kay was cited by Edgewater police for driving while impaired after he was 
pulled over for speeding. Kay, a two-time offender of the NFL's substance-abuse 
policy, faces a possible suspension from the league.

"The calls have probably numbered in the low thousands in the last two days," 
Seward said. "People are asking about season tickets, club boxes and luxury

Callers' names are being placed on a priority roster to be used if tickets go
