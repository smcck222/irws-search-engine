KNBC, which presents good newscasts in general, is a pleasure to watch. 
</P>
<P>
But may I offer a small suggestion to Kelly Lange? Please, Kelly, update your 
makeup and hairdo. The long, bushy hair is so outdated. You are a very 
attractive lady, but a shorter, neater, smarter hair style would be an immense 
help. And please dump those big, circular, dangling earrings. 
</P>
<P>
This is a personal opinion, of course, but many of my friends have expressed 
the same opinions.

I played the sappy music behind Secure Horizon's "Harry" commercial of which 
Lorraine Evans (Viewers' Views, Aug. 19) is so tired. 
</P>
<P>
She should realize that the actor who portrays Harry probably will retire 
comfortably, and I will have my monthly phone bill paid each month by royalties 
we receive when the commercial is running. 
</P>
<P>
So in the interest of commerce and long-distance rates, hang in there, 
Lorraine, and hope for the version when Beth doesn't make it.

I'm one of the many viewers delighted with ABC's "Life Goes On." I enjoy it for 
many reasons, one of which is its optimistic portrayal of Down's syndrome, but 
also for another reason. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder how many of the show's fans realize that Patti LuPone, whose Libby 
Thacher is one of the most entertaining TV mothers around, is also one of 
Broadway's best? As Reno Sweeney in the Broadway revival of "Anything Goes," 
Fantine in "Les Miserables" on London's West End and the star of "Evita," she 
is one of today's most versatile and successful stars. 
</P>
<P>
I am pleased that "Life Goes On" allows such a wonderful arena for LuPone to 
display her many talents. Long may it go on!

MOVIES OF THE WEEK 
</P>

By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
E.A.R.T.H. Force (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie/series pilot starring 
Gil Gerard and Joanna Pacula, concerns a tycoon's right-hand woman forming a 
special team to deal with a nuclear meltdown crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The disappointing 1989 TV movie My Boyfriend's Back (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) 
tells of a TV special that reunites a '60s girls group who had one hit record. 
</P>
<P>
The 1983 Sudden Impact (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), the fourth of Clint Eastwood's 
Dirty Harry movies, is assuredly the worst, a nakedly manipulative exploitation 
picture that's an unabashed call for everyone who believes he or she has been 
wronged to take the law into his or her own hands. Not only does it exploit sex 
and violence but also audiences' prejudices against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The Way West (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.), an ambitious 1967 account of a 
covered wagon train crossing the Oregon Trail in 1843 that stars Kirk Douglas, 
Robert Mitchum and Richard Widmark, was sabotaged by a terrible script. 
</P>
<P>
Babies (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, tells of several women who face 
different problems as each attempts to become pregnant. Lindsay Wagner stars. 
</P>
<P>
Field of Dreams (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) was the most potent, unexpected fantasy 
of the '80s -- a heartfelt, irresistible account of a young farmer (Kevin 
Costner) who heeds "the voices" who tell him to build a baseball diamond on his 
Iowa cornfield, which is suddenly populated by baseball greats of the past. At 
the heart of the matter of Phil Alden Robinson's marvelous film is a grown 
man's yearning for a reconciliation with his long-gone father. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Stevens stars in the new Hidden View (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m., 
again on Saturday at 8 p.m.) as a mysterious home security agent hired to 
investigate the affairs of an adulterous rock star's beautiful young wife 
(Tanya Roberts). 
</P>
<P>
One of John Frankenheimer's finest films, the 1966 Seconds (Channel 11 
Wednesday at 8 p.m.) stars Rock Hudson as a man in late middle age who receives 
a handsome, youthful new appearance. With superlative James Wong Howe 
black-and-white cinematography, a taut Lewis John Carlino script and a 
top-notch performance from Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
Lasse Hallstrom's wonderful 1985 Swedish film My Life as a Dog (Channel 13 
Wednesday at 8 p.m.), at once funny and touching, is about a resilient 
12-year-old (Anton Glanzelius) coping with a new life with relatives in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Mills plays a high-powered attorney whose life is turned upside down when 
she falls in love with her young male secretary (Brian Wimmer) in the new TV 
movie The World's Oldest Living Bridesmaid (CBS Friday at 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
In the new TV movie Murder C.O.D. (NBC Friday at 9 p.m.), a police commander 
hunts a killer who exacts fees from the enemies of his victims. Patrick Duffy 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills Cop (ABC Saturday at 9 p.m.), the 1984 Eddie Murphy smash hit, is 
a slick, sleek, violent high-style Hollywood entertainment that seduces you in 
spite of yourself.

DAUGHTER MAY NOT SUFFER THE PAIN

A couple who immigrated here from Haiti found the right words and attitudes 
while raising their daughter. She just became Miss America. If this could 
happen, I have no doubt that Sandy Banks and her husband can find a way in 
which to raise a happy and fulfilled Alyssa.

DAUGHTER MAY NOT SUFFER THE PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sandy Banks' piece, "Mom, Will Anyone in My Class Look Like Me?" (Sept. 10) 
seems indulgent and melodramatic. So far, Banks' daughter seems to be doing 
great and she may or may not encounter the pain her mother predicts. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like the family has a nice home. The Banks have clearly chosen to 
make their daughter "the lone black child in a sea of white faces" for reasons 
they feel are valid. In any case, in this day and age, no one, certainly not 
the residents of Porter Ranch, will be surprised at a black or brown face. Our 
city is too diversified for that. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Banks may have to face a more painful issue: One reason for the sad 
decline of social and educational conditions in South-Central Los Angeles is 
that black families that could provide an exception to the "neighborhoods 
racked by crime" choose to flee. 
</P>
<P>
As a part-time substitute teacher who has looked the problems squarely in the 
eyes at Foshay, Locke, Jefferson, Bret Harte and Carver schools, I have often 
thought that the single most powerful factor in braking the terrible cycle of 
ignorance would be that my kids would have neighbors like the Banks family.

Re "Hate to Eat Alone? Try Shared Tables" (Aug. 27): They have been doing it 
for years -- in Austria, Germany and England. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I once shared a table with a couple in a hotel dining room in 
London. Imagine our surprise and delight when in the course of conversation it 
turned out that my relatives were their best friends. 
</P>
<P>
On lonely business trips abroad, I always looked for a table to share.

STRAIGHT FACTS FOR STORY ON GAY CATHOLICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your story "They Pray Alone" really struck a chord. Gay, straight, man, woman, 
young, old -- it doesn't matter. All Catholics pray alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope, cardinals, bishops and priests are little more than superfluous, 
self-appointed middle men with pretenses to divinely ordained authority. 
</P>
<P>
Many priests are genuinely decent, compassionate men, concerned with the lives 
of their congregations. But few of the men who actually run the Catholic Church 
are interested in matters of spirituality. The Church's administration is the 
ultimate fascistic dictatorship, a remnant of bureaucracy/theocracy directly 
descended from the all-time champion of state despotism, the Roman Empire. 
</P>
<P>
This elite, privileged male priesthood is contemptuous of everything that does 
not support the politics of patriarchal monotheism -- particularly women and 
all notions of personal or social freedom.

RENEWAL PROJECT TO GET BOOST; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: MONTEREY PARK PREPARES TO INVEST ANOTHER $5 MILLION IN ATLANTIC 
SQUARE. CONSULTANTS SEE LITTLE PROFIT FOR 30 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Already embroiled in a property dispute that will delay completion of the 
Atlantic Square Shopping Center project for at least a year, the City Council 
is preparing to sink $5 million more into the redevelopment deal. 
</P>
<P>
And although city officials say the new, revamped Mediterranean-style mall at 
South Atlantic Boulevard and Floral Drive will give residents an attractive 
place to shop, they concede that the benefits of increased tax revenue will be 
long delayed. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take many, many, many years for it to pay for itself," City 
Councilwoman Marie T. Purvis said. "At least residents will have the 
convenience of shopping in their own city. It would be foolish to back down at 
this point." 
</P>
<P>
Because of tighter lending policies due to the savings and loan crisis, the 
city and its partner in the project, Champion Development Inc. of Long Beach, 
will have to put up as much as $8 million more than the original $27-million 
price tag, said Keith Breskin, the city's director of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
Champion, which was originally to put up $15 million for the project, has 
agreed to pay $18 million. Monterey Park officials must decide whether to make 
up the difference, which could be as much as $17 million, Breskin said. The 
city originally planned to spend $11.6 million on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials thought they could finish the project by Thanksgiving, 
construction has not begun, mainly because of a dispute over how much the city 
Redevelopment Agency should pay the mall's current owner, Milton Bilak. 
</P>
<P>
A court hearing is set for Jan. 7, 1991, to determine the value of the land. 
Breskin said that if all goes well, the developer will break ground next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a consultant's report released last week shows that Monterey Park 
stands to make little, if any, net profit during the first 30 years the new 
Atlantic Square operates. 
</P>
<P>
By 2022, the city will have made about $100,000 profit on the project in 1990 
dollars, according to a study by Kotin, Regan &amp; Mouchly Inc. of West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The consulting firm said total revenue to the city over the 30 years from sales 
taxes, property tax increments under redevelopment law and other sources will 
be $73.2 million, without allowing for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But the effects of inflation will be considerable, the report said. For 
example, after 30 years the city will have received a total of $16 million in 
sales taxes from the mall, but that will be only $3.4 million in 1990 dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never said this was a great business decision for a private entity to 
make," Breskin said. "But this is a city. We don't do redevelopment to make 
money. We've got to do things that benefit the populace. If we don't rejuvenate 
(Atlantic Square) . . . we'll have a huge black hole in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Judy Chu agreed. "It's not made to be a wildly successful financial 
thing; that we knew coming into it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But if the city abandons Atlantic Square and allows it to decline further, Chu 
said, the city's business outlook would be dim. Monterey Park's per-capita 
sales tax revenue is among the lowest in the San Gabriel Valley, and rebuilding 
Atlantic Square, which has lost a number of restaurants, department stores and 
groceries, is seen as a key to boost the area. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for Atlantic Square has left one councilman doubting that the 
city's projected benefits outweigh the risk. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to be saddled in heavy debt," said Councilman Samuel Kiang, who 
cast the lone vote against tentative approval of the new financing agreement in 
a closed session last week. "We will not recoup the costs. We will never recoup 
the entire investment."

WORLD EVENTS SUPPLY SERMON TOPICS FOR JEWS' HIGH HOLY DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN SWISSLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The problems faced by Jews leaving the Soviet Union and the conflict in the 
Middle East will be among the topics of rabbis across the San Gabriel Valley 
during the Jewish High Holy Days, which begin this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We pray for our American hostages and the many thousands of other hostages," 
said Rabbi Elisha Nattiv of the Temple Shalom of the East San Gabriel Valley in 
West Covina. Their plight, he said, is relevant to the High Holy Day theme of 
"soul searching, and how to improve our lives in the coming year as 
individuals, as families, as a community, as a country." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Gilbert Kollin of the Pasadena Temple, the largest in the San Gabriel 
Valley, will speak on "The Best of Times and the Worst of Times." 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning of the year we were so euphoric, the (Berlin) Wall came down, 
the 'Evil Empire' was gone, and then suddenly on Aug. 2 the Middle East blows 
up and suddenly we refocus on the problems of our world," Kollin said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 150,000 Soviet emigres expected to arrive in Israel by the end 
of 1990 have to surmount obstacles that come with restarting one's life from 
scratch, said Freddie Rambaum of Operation Exodus, an organization spearheading 
many of the resettlement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Aid is needed there because an additional 300,000 Soviet Jewish emigres are 
expected by the end of 1991. About 250 Soviet Jews live in the San Gabriel 
Valley, about 1% of all those who have resettled in Los Angeles in the last few 
years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The High Holy Days have been targeted for a sweeping appeal by Operation Exodus 
because "it's the time of year when the whole Jewish world gets together," 
Rambaum said. 
</P>
<P>
"Operation Exodus represents for the Jewish community a historical opportunity 
to do today what we could not do during the Holocaust" she said. "The Jewish 
community is going to make sure that with these gates open, the opportunity 
will not be lost to rescue these Jews." 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish High Holy Day season will begin with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New 
Year 5751, at sunset Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement marked 
by prayer and a 24-hour fast, are intended as a time for introspection and 
setting goals for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
Yom Kippur begins at sunset Sept. 28 and concludes at sunset Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Other High Holy Days sermon topics: 
</P>
<P>
* At Temple Beth Israel in Pomona, Rabbi-in-Residence Fred Krinsky will speak 
on "Sin and Forgiveness in the Modern World." Krinksy, a former professor at 
Pomona College, lectures frequently on Judaic history. 
</P>
<P>
* Rabbi William J. Gordon at Temple Beth Torah in Alhambra will speak on 
"Born-Again Jews" and "Making the 'You' of the Bible into 'I.' " 
</P>
<P>
* Temple Beth David of the San Gabriel Valley in Temple City will use Rabbi 
Alan Lachtman's sermon, "The New Year -- A Time for New Beginnings" to help 
kick off the temple's new hunger-fighting program. Like many synagogues, Temple 
Beth David is asking High Holy Days participants to bring groceries, money or 
clothes on Yom Kippur for donation to local food banks and Jewish charities. 
</P>
<P>
And back at the Pasadena Temple, workers were busy last week outfitting the 
gymnasium for an expected 1,100 worshipers. "Everybody feels the need and 
obligation to come to the synagogue" during the High Holy Days, particularly on 
Yom Kippur, Kollin said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how people run down to the post office on April 15, just in time to 
get their tax returns in? Well, this is like a chance to get your prayers in 
before the gates close," he said, referring to the Kol Nidre service, which 
signifies the start of Yom Kippur.

Her job includes investigating alleged violations of city planning, 
development, fire and building codes. The complaints range from illegal parking 
on residential property to substandard housing. 
</P>
<P>
During investigations of abandoned houses, she has found drug paraphernalia, 
knee-deep trash, a mattress and baby clothes in a swimming pool, and raw sewage 
in a front yard. 
</P>
<P>
"Code enforcement used to be hit or miss," she said. "Before, if there were 
major complaints, a planner or the Community Service Department worked a couple 
of hours a day, and would go out and take a look." 
</P>
<P>
But for Ver Kuilen, it is a full-time job. And sometimes she wishes she had 
help. When she first started, she said, she sat on the floor in her small 
office and sifted through boxes of files containing 400 Municipal Code 
violations -- about two years' worth. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mess," she said. "There were stacks of files, and no rhyme or reason 
to the filing system." 
</P>
<P>
The first thing she did was obtain file cabinets and folders and organize 
complaints by street names. 
</P>
<P>
When she receives a complaint, she investigates it and, if necessary, leaves a 
warning notice with a 10-day deadline for compliance. If the violation 
continues, the property owner is allowed 10 more days to correct it. A 
conference with the district attorney's office is scheduled if the violation 
persists. 
</P>
<P>
Since she started, Ver Kuilen has pursued criminal charges against two property 
owners -- the first such cases in the city. One will go to trial in October; no 
trial date has been set for the other. She has 11 other cases pending in which 
criminal charges may also be filed. 
</P>
<P>
She rips down illegal signs from telephone poles with the help of what she 
calls her "wicked stick," which is four feet long and pointed. She removed it 
from an illegal campaign sign, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ver Kuilen is also certified to make arrests and to carry a gun, although she 
chooses not to. Still, the job is not without its risks. 
</P>
<P>
"One man told me that if I came on his property, he would blow me away," she 
said. "Another time I was sitting in my car when a man grabbed my arm, yelling 
and screaming: 'It's my property! I can do what I want!' I get a lot of yelling 
and screaming."

SCHOOLS MAKE SURE SMOGGY AIR IS NO SWEAT FOR STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As smoggy air hangs like a brown blanket over large parts of the San Gabriel 
Valley, school districts say they are monitoring air quality and are shutting 
down sports activities when Stage 1 smog alerts are declared. 
</P>
<P>
Many local districts say smog alerts haven't disrupted school because they are 
declared by the South Coast Air Quality Management District in the mid- or late 
afternoon, when physical education classes are already over. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, because classes have just resumed this week in most districts, 
sports teams that traditionally practice outside during the unhealthful late 
afternoons have not started workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not outside yet; we're issuing locks and lockers, and the kids aren't 
involved in activities yet," said Todd Denton, principal of Rosemead High 
School in the El Monte Union High School District, an area hard-hit by 
unhealthful air in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
But some school officials wonder about the air quality even on days when the 
AQMD doesn't issue smog alerts. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you can't see the mountains, but there's still no Stage 1 smog 
alert," said Charles Parcell, chief of campus police for the Pasadena Unified 
School District and the man charged with curtailing phys ed activity during 
smog alerts. 
</P>
<P>
Some schools monitor an AQMD radio frequency to find out about unhealthful air 
quality. Others call the air quality board for reports. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Glendora Unified, in an area that has also suffered from 
unhealthful air in recent days, call the air quality board and also rely on a 
monitoring instrument at the school district to provide readings each day. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get the smog alert, we stop the activity for that day," said Keith 
Hilliard, director of Instructional Support Services for Glendora Unified. 
</P>
<P>
Hilliard said that in past years, athletes have filed into the gym during the 
smog alerts to continue workouts. But so far this year, no smog alerts have 
occurred during class hours. 
</P>
<P>
When smog alerts cause cancellation of after-school sports, coaches sometimes 
reschedule practices for evenings. But that isn't always an option for phys ed 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Glendora High has 1,800 kids, and you can't have 1,800 kids at PE in the 
morning, it's physically impossible," Hilliard said.

MEDICAL CENTER DOESN'T WANT TO SHARE NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley Medical Center has been in business for more than 30 years, 
and officials at the 300-bed, private, nonprofit hospital in the city of San 
Gabriel are not about to share its name. 
</P>
<P>
So they were a little vexed last week when Los Angeles County officials 
referred to a public hospital that has been proposed for Irwindale as . . . the 
San Gabriel Valley Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Patients were confused when they read about it in the newspaper. They wanted 
to know if we were moving," said Pamela Kouba, spokeswoman for the real San 
Gabriel Valley Medical Center. She was referring to a report in The Times last 
week about the county's hospital plans. 
</P>
<P>
County officials apologized for the confusion -- saying they considered the 
medical center name as merely "generic." And they promised, henceforward, to 
call the public hospital proposed for Irwindale by another name. 
</P>
<P>
East Valley Medical Center is one possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is an East Valley Medical Center," said William Weitekamp, 
project manager for the proposed county hospital. "I'll have to look it up." 
</P>
<P>
Finding a name isn't the only tricky task in building a public hospital in the 
San Gabriel Valley. Irwindale officials have expressed concern that the site 
near the 605 Freeway that the county selected for the medical center is already 
being developed as an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, county planners say: They are confident they can find a way to 
acquire the industrial park, turn it into a hospital and give it a new name.

HELP IS SOUGHT IN SOLVING ARSON FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Forest Service officials are seeking help in solving an arson fire that 
scorched 25 acres at the mouth of Roberts Canyon by Highway 39 in Azusa last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The Aug. 16 fire was caused by an illegal campfire not far from the bike path 
along the San Gabriel River, said Glenn Wears, law enforcement coordinator for 
the forest service's Mt. Baldy District in Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that somebody saw someone running away," Wears said, noting there 
is no automobile access in the immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information should call Wears or Rita Nolan at (818) 335-1251.

A TOWNHOUSE FOR BIBLIOPHILES IN PHILADELPHIA

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just a stone's throw from elegant Rittenhouse Square in the shadow of 
Philadelphia's financial district, a 19th-Century townhouse beckons book lovers 
from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library is home to priceless literary and historical 
works, including rare books and manuscripts and documents tracing the history 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's gems range from the Bay Psalm Book, the first book printed in the 
American colonies, to the manuscript of novelist James Joyce's masterpiece 
"Ulysses" and the living room of American poet Marianne Moore. 
</P>
<P>
The Rosenbach collection, part of which is highlighted in special museum 
exhibitions, includes more than 30,000 books, 270,000 manuscripts, 20,000 art 
works on paper, 500 paintings and miniatures and 750 photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1954, the museum is the legacy of Philip Rosenbach (1863-1953) and 
his brother Dr. Abraham Simon Wolf Rosenbach (1876-1952), whose shops in 
Philadelphia and New York City were long a magnet for book collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham Rosenbach roamed the world acquiring literary treasures for wealthy 
clients. He also acquired a reputation as America's most famous dealer in rare 
books and manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
To his friend, the writer Christopher Morley, Rosenbach was "the Pied Piper of 
rare editions. He blows an airy wheedling note and the old vellums and 
calfskins come trotting after him." 
</P>
<P>
His biographers called him "the Napoleon of the auction room, the man who set 
record prices year after year." 
</P>
<P>
His collecting prowess in a career spanning the first half of this century 
brought Rosenbach much wealth and publicity and occasional criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach's 1928 purchase at auction of the manuscript of Lewis Carroll's 
"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" for $77,000 infuriated many Britons, who 
were aghast at the loss of a national treasure. The manuscript, later sold by 
Rosenbach for a $20,000 profit, was eventually returned to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The Rosenbach acquisition in 1924 of Joyce's Ulysses manuscript for $1,975 
inspired a sarcastic quatrain by the Irish writer. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce was angered at being unable to raise the money to buy back the longhand 
manuscript of what is now considered the century's most influential novel and 
because Rosenbach paid four times more at the same sale for a manuscript of 
Joseph Conrad's novel "Victory." 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Joyce: 
</P>
<P>
"Rosy Brook he bought a book 
</P>
<P>
"Though he didn't know how to spell it. 
</P>
<P>
"Such is the lure of literature 
</P>
<P>
 "To the lad who can buy and sell it." 
</P>
<P>
No mere book dealer, however, Rosenbach was an avid collector whose love for 
his precious finds made possible the museum, which was established by trustees 
of the Rosenbach estate. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Rosenbach was well known for putting ridiculously high prices on things 
that he really didn't want to part with. That really became the foundation of 
his personal collection," said Leslie Morris, the museum's books and 
manuscripts curator. 
</P>
<P>
A tour of the museum, housed in the four-story home shared by the brothers in 
their final years, testifies to broad and distinguished tastes. 
</P>
<P>
Amid antiques collected by Philip Rosenbach, the collection yields distinct 
literary treasures at every turn. Historical documents and letters bear the 
great names of European and American history. There are manuscripts by Conrad, 
Geoffrey Chaucer and Charles Dickens, first editions of "Don Quixote" and 
"Robinson Crusoe," books once owned by John Milton and Abraham Lincoln, even 
Herman Melville's bookcase. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the Marianne Moore living room, whose contents, including a 
typewriter, books and autographed baseballs, were moved to the museum from 
Moore's Greenwich Village apartment after her death in 1972 and precisely 
rearranged. The museum also houses the Moore archives. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said the museum and library annually attract about 7,000 visitors and 
450 literary researchers, who pore over authors' manuscripts and letters. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is not only to display but also to perpetuate (the Rosenbachs') 
scholarly and social contributions," Morris said. "We see as our mission to 
explain to the general public the importance of rare books and art objects." 
</P>
<P>
The Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library is open to the public for tours Tuesday 
through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. Address: 2010 DeLancey Place, 
Philadelphia, Pa. 19103. Call (215) 732-1600.

IN FRANCE, AN ENCHANTING MUSEUM FOR SOLDIERS WITH NO PAST OR NAME

AUBAGNE, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were on the outskirts of Aubagne, a town about 10 miles east of Marseilles, 
when I saw the sign: Legion Etrangere. 
</P>
<P>
I know only enough French to order cafe in a cafe, but Legion Etrangere I have 
known since I was a boy . . . since I first read "Beau Geste" and gloried in 
the exploits of the brothers Beau, John and Dirk. 
</P>
<P>
And I have seen the movie -- the silent version, the remake and the remake of 
the remake -- I don't know how many times. But never a real legionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
Not until this quiet Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
I heard him before I saw him. Just around the corner from the headquarters of 
the 1st Foreign Regiment is the Musee du Kepi Blanc, a museum named for the 
distinctive boxlike white cap worn by legionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
We had let ourselves in and had begun our leisurely inspection when he took up 
his song. Softly at first. In French of course. I have no idea what he was 
singing about, but the song was so sweet, so plaintive and so absolutely 
appropriate for this place on a Sunday morning that I was struck dumb and had 
to remind myself to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
I was drawn to the singer. My wife too. She had heard him up on the second 
floor. We followed his song to a duty room just off the foyer. And there he was 
-- my first legionnaire. Not exactly the jut-jawed, hell-for-leather 
swashbuckler I had held in my mind all these years. 
</P>
<P>
No, this was a tall, sparse man with a shaved head (cut in the regulation style 
known as boule a zero), a whole rank of missing uppers and an impressive gash 
-- just beginning to heal -- that arced down from his right temple to just 
below his eye. 
</P>
<P>
But, oh, his bearing was proud and his every movement eloquent. 
</P>
<P>
He bade us bon jour and then "good morning." I had questions for him and it was 
obvious it had been a while since he had been presented with this much English. 
But he warmed to it and before long the words were rolling out. 
</P>
<P>
There are two things about a French Foreign Legionnaire I have always known: 
You never ask his name, and you never ask where he is from. These are, after 
all, men who have taken new names -- Legion names. And they have only present 
and future -- no past. So I was very careful to keep it to small talk. 
</P>
<P>
Whereupon my wife piped up, "Your accent . . . is it Scottish?" 
</P>
<P>
Oh, my! 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. "Oh, no, ma'am, I am from Canada." 
</P>
<P>
"Canada!" she exclaimed. "Where in Canada?" 
</P>
<P>
Oh, my! Oh, my! 
</P>
<P>
He smiled again. "New Brunswick," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I grew up in Canada . . . in the West," she continued. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an uncle who had a farm out in Alberta," our Legionnaire replied. "About 
10 miles from a town called Lethbridge." 
</P>
<P>
"Lethbridge!" my wife exclaimed again. "We were married in Lethbridge." 
</P>
<P>
And that is how we came to make the acquaintance of Corporal-Chef Fraser 
MacDonald of St. John, New Brunswick, a 13-year veteran of the Legion who is 
concierge-caretaker-curator of this remarkable museum that celebrates 160 years 
of the purest tradition of soldiering. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is French Foreign Legion -- from the marble floor to the red tile 
roof. When, in 1962, the Legion withdrew from Algeria, where it had been 
headquartered since its inception, it literally dismantled 130 years of history 
and brought it -- stone by stone -- here to Aubagne. 
</P>
<P>
"What you see is Legion," the corporal said. He wanted to be very sure we did 
not mistake any of it as France's doing or, God forbid, the regular army's. He 
tipped back a straightback chair, one of four pulled up to a long conference 
table. Its seat was beautifully inlaid with rare woods. 
</P>
<P>
"These chairs were made in 1846 by a Legionnaire while serving a disciplinary 
sentence," he explained. "They are made from old ammunition cases." 
</P>
<P>
He bade me to get down on my knees to note the stenciling on the underside. It 
was an old ammunition case, all right. 
</P>
<P>
He swung open a massive black iron door -- a crimped and tortured work of art. 
"This door was made in 1963 by a Legionnaire," the corporal explained. "There 
are precisely 645.84 meters of welding in its construction." 
</P>
<P>
The door opened onto a parade ground, at one end of which stood a huge bronze 
globe supported by an enormous stone plinth, a memorial to the Legion dead. 
Only heroes walk there. We were not permitted beyond the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
Every April 30, the Legion's most sacred relic -- the wooden hand of Capitaine 
Danjou -- is paraded in this square. It was discovered in the rubble of a 
farmhouse in Camerone, Mexico, following a fierce, all-day engagement in which 
Danjou and 60-some Legionnaires (three of whom lived to tell about it) held off 
a force of 2,000 Mexican soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"La Fete de Camerone is the most important day in the Legion calendar," Corp. 
MacDonald explained. "The hand comes out of its box and is carried by an old 
Legionnaire -- the most decorated among us." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise it rests in a reliquary in the Legion Hall of Honour, where the names 
of the 903 Legion officers killed in battle are inscribed, and where Legion 
campaigns -- Crimee, Tonkin, Dahomy, Maroc . . . I count more than 20 -- march 
in close order across the cold marble. 
</P>
<P>
We stood at the head of the stairs and looked down into the room. It was as 
still and cold as the bed of an old dark pond. The ashes of a Legionnaire from 
Chicago -- William Moll -- were tucked into a little windowed recess. 
</P>
<P>
It went on like this for two floors -- a melange of religion, romance and proud 
military tradition: bloodied battle flags, ordnance and weapons, the 
accouterments of cavalry, the medals of Legion heroes and the kepis of its 
famous fallen, a grand parade of Legion uniforms that steps off with the first 
fusilier. 
</P>
<P>
And here and there something unexpected: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A macabre display: a scattering of bullets dug out of the exhumed bodies of 
legionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Exquisite carvings, parquetry, sculpture, metalwork and tapestries turned 
out by the rough hands of soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A brass cross wreathed in barbed wire. "In beloved memory of Lt. Alain de 
Woillement who fell in battle Dec. 28, 1948 in French Indo-China," the card 
next to it reads. And then this: "I rose from the chill ground and folded my 
soldier in his blanket and buried him where he fell." 
</P>
<P>
And all around are heroic paintings, watercolors, photographs and portraits of 
the men of many nations -- crusaders, they used to be called. 
</P>
<P>
(The latest crusaders, we learned from news reports when we returned home, have 
been East Europeans. Hungry for work, they have been flocking to join the 
Legion since their borders opened, a senior officer was quoted as saying. Each 
month now, of the 120 men who enlist for five years, more than 30 come from 
Eastern Europe, with the exception of Albania and East Germany.) 
</P>
<P>
When we had seen it all, we stopped at the regimental shop for a souvenir, 
something to remind us of this morning spent with the French Foreign Legion. My 
wife settled on a water pitcher and six drinking glasses -- rough-worked, blue 
as the May sky and just $29 for the set. 
</P>
<P>
"Made by retired legionnaires at our rest home at Puyloubier," the corporal 
told us. And he threw in a look that said "by now you should have it figured 
out -- everything is Legion." 
</P>
<P>
As for myself, I came away with a kepi blanc for which I paid $20. The instant 
I put it on the memories came crowding in -- the burning African sun, the sift 
and drift of the Sahara, the furnace blast pounding against the parapets at Ft. 
Zinderneuf. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me very thirsty, wearing this cap," I said. Of course the corporal 
had easement for that, too. Wine from the Legion vineyards at Puyloubier 
bottled under the Capitaine Danjou label. I tried a little of the red. I would 
pronounce it . . . wellborn and proud.

Near the community of Trade, population about 40, a beautiful antebellum white 
mansion sprawls across the top of a small knoll in the midst of rolling green 
hill. David O. Selznick could have used it for Tara in "Gone With the Wind." A 
local citizen caught our astonished looks and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty nice spread for us hillbillies, isn't it?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Old myths and stereotypes die hard. People still envision poverty-stricken, 
bare-foot farmers smoking corn-cob pipes when they talk about this corner of 
southern Appalachia in northeastern Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens of this historic mountain country take it all in stride. And while 
they're a tolerant lot who even make fun of that hardscrabble farmer image, 
they're also loyal Tennesseans who are fiercely proud of their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
This is the land of America's first frontier, where westward migration began in 
the 18th Century. Daniel Boone set off from here with his 30 ax-men to cut the 
Wilderness Trail into Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
The first constitution ever written by Americans was drafted here. The first 
territorial capitol was established here. Davy Crockett was born here. 
</P>
<P>
America's seventh President, Andrew Jackson, practiced law in Jonesborough, 
Tennessee's oldest town. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Jonesborough has gained notoriety as the home of the National 
Storytelling Festival, held for three days during the first full weekend in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
The festival began in 1973, the creation of Jonesborough's former mayor, Jimmy 
Neil Smith, who invited five storytellers to tell tales from the back of a hay 
wagon to about 60 listeners. Today, storytellers come from around the world. 
This year, more than 6,000 people are expected to hear them when the festival 
is held Oct. 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
Jonesborough is the first town in the United States to be entered on the 
National Register as a designated historic district. Chartered in 1779 (before 
there was even a Tennessee), Jonesborough has survived Cherokee Indian attacks, 
the Revolution and the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the town looks as it did a century ago, with handsomely restored old 
buildings, cluttered antique shops and churches dating back to the 1840s. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Jackson lived here when he was a young lawyer, boarding in a log cabin 
that has been restored and relocated on Main Street, which was once the Great 
Stage Road between Nashville and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was threatened with a tar-and-feathering in his younger days, just down 
the block at the Chester Inn, which dates to 1797. Later, he returned and 
hosted a great reception there during his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The inn is undergoing restoration, and is soon to be the official home and 
museum of the National Association for the Preservation and Perpetuation of 
Storytelling (NAPPS). 
</P>
<P>
Every small town in this historic corner of Tennessee, or at least some part of 
it, seems to be either a National Historic Landmark or on the National Register 
of Historic Places. The townspeople live in houses listed in the National 
Register. Their homes are featured in national magazines, their furniture so 
exquisite they are asked to loan it to museums for display. So much for that 
hillbilly image. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of visitors pass by this area every year on their way to the Great 
Smoky Mountains National Park, 80 miles south. They miss a lot. 
</P>
<P>
A short detour off Interstate 81 takes visitors along winding scenic country 
roads, past lakes, rivers, state parks or into the Cherokee National Forest to 
the east. Historic cities and towns, crammed with things to see and do, skirt 
both sides of the busy highway. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, potter Nancy Patterson Lamb, who trained in Los Angeles and perfected 
her craft at Finland's Arabia pottery works and Denmark's Royal Copenhagen, 
founded Iron Mountain Stoneware in the hamlet of Laurel Bloomery, near the 
junction of the Virginia and North Carolina borders. The transplanted 
Californian has been there ever since, selling her products across the country 
-- to places such as Tiffany's in New York and Gump's in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Just up the road from Jonesborough, off Highway 321, more history-making events 
took place at Sycamore Shoals in Elizabethton, site of the first permanent 
settlement outside the original 13 colonies. 
</P>
<P>
The first constitution ever written by Americans (even before the Declaration 
of Independence) was drafted there, and the largest land purchase in our 
nation's history, the Transylvania Purchase, took place at Ft. Watauga, when 
Richard Henderson bought 20 million acres from the Cherokee Indians for a 
paltry 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The reconstructed fort stands near the Watauga River, part of the Sycamore 
Shoals State Historic Area. Other worthwhile visits in Elizabethton are the 
1780 Carter Mansion, one of the oldest houses remaining in Tennessee, and, for 
fans of covered bridges, the still-in-use, l34-foot wooden structure crossing 
the Doe River. 
</P>
<P>
At Piney Flats, less then 10 miles away, a log house known as Rocky Mount 
served as the first territorial capitol in the United States when President 
Washington appointed William Blount as territorial governor in 1790. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky Mount is now a living-history museum, where interpreters dressed in 
authentic costumes re-create life as it was when Mr. and Mrs. William Cobb, the 
original owners, lived there. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are greeted as if they are friends who have come to call for a Sunday 
visit, and Mrs. Cobb leads guests through her home and shows off her "purdy" 
furniture and "necessary chair" (commode), punctuating her gossip about the 
neighbors with frequent "mercy sakes" declarations. 
</P>
<P>
When Daniel Boone set out to cross the Cumberland Gap in 1775, the area of 
Kingsport was still part of North Carolina. The city wasn't established until 
1802 when William King built a boat yard on the Holston River. 
</P>
<P>
Exchange Place, a restored 19th-Century pioneer farm homestead in Kingsport, 
was another major stop where travelers exchanged horses and currency along the 
Great Stage Road. Today, visitors are treated to crafts demonstrations and 
tours of the eight buildings (six are original) on the grounds, including a 
blacksmith shop and smokehouse. 
</P>
<P>
If historic houses and architecture are your passion, take a run south on 
Highway 11W to Rogersville, another small town on the Great Stage Road. Founded 
in 1789, Rogersville claims 35 sites on the National Register, from churches 
and mansions to a railroad depot. 
</P>
<P>
It's worth the trip just to stop in (for a meal or for the night) at the Hale 
Springs Inn, which has been serving travelers since it was built in 1824. 
You'll find an 1889 guest book in the lobby, as well as the original 
wainscoting, chair rails, pine plank floors and Colonial furniture. 
</P>
<P>
The streets of Greeneville, founded in 1783, are still lined with gracious 
antebellum homes. The town claims America's l7th President, Andrew Johnson, as 
its most famous resident. The much-maligned Johnson (he was the only President 
to have articles of impeachment brought against him) came to Greeneville from 
North Carolina as a l7-year-old in 1826 and died there in 1875. 
</P>
<P>
Just east of Greeneville, the 63-acre Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park, 
including a reproduction of the log cabin in which he was born, runs along the 
banks of the Nolichuckey River. (Crockett was not born on a mountaintop, 
contrary to what Walt Disney Studiosmay have depicted.) 
</P>
<P>
If you feel a need to unwind after all this historic touring, one perfect spot 
would be Roan Mountain State Resort Park, with its lofty meadows, wildflowers, 
gardens, conifer forest and impressive views of the Blue Ridge Range. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a preserved homestead, settled in 1878, in the park on Strawberry 
Mountain. The caretaker, grandson of the original homesteader, will sit on the 
front porch with visitors and reminisce. It's like being on Walton's Mountain. 
Any moment you expect to hear Mary Beth or Erin call out "Night, John." 
</P>
<P>
If you're really lucky, you might catch Jim Miller playing his hammered 
dulcimer on a balmy summer evening in the park. The music ("It's bluegrass, not 
country; there's a difference, you know," says Miller) is so sweet it can bring 
tears to your eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Hillbilly music, some people say. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful music.

CONSUMER REPORT: NEW PENALTY ON SHOPPING ABROAD; 
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA: THE STATE'S CONTROVERSIAL TAX ON ITEMS PURCHASED IN FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES AND EXCEEDING $400 IN VALUE WILL BE REIMPOSED NEXT MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The purchases that travelers make while abroad and bring back to California may 
wind up more costly than anticipated as of Oct. 1. That's when the state's 
Board of Equalization is re-imposing its controversial use tax. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a once-obscure 1935 law designed to protect state businesses from 
tax-free, out-of-state competition, the use tax mandates that residents 
returning to California pay a tax on their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the tax depends on which county travelers live in. Through the 
end of this year, the tax will vary from 6.25% to 7.25%, dropping down to 6% or 
7% in 1991. The current applicable tax rate in Los Angeles County is 6.75%. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Equalization anticipates sending approximately 30,000 tax forms 
annually to residents returning through California ports of entry, and to get 
an average payment of $218 in return. If your U.S. Customs declaration 
indicates that you are subject to the use tax, expect to get the unwelcome 
statement within two to six months after clearing customs. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue from the use tax is expected to exceed $6 million each year, with the 
funds targeted to support other state and local government services. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers aren't affected by the use tax unless they bring back purchased items 
valued more than $400. If the goods are less than this amount, travelers are 
not required to itemize the possessions on their customs declaration form or 
pay duty on them. The board also won't bother collecting taxes on relatively 
small amounts due, although it declined to say what this sum is. 
</P>
<P>
"The statements will be sent out on a continuous basis around mid-month," said 
board spokeswoman Delena Bratton. Travelers will have until the end of the 
following month, roughly 30 to 45 days, to pay the amount due. A penalty of 10% 
will be imposed on late payments. 
</P>
<P>
The board actually began enforcement of the use tax late last year. But lack of 
prior notice created a furor and the program was suspended. At the time, the 
board said that there would be substantial notice given to consumers if the 
program were reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Now the board, with funding provided in the 1990-91 state budget, is going 
about matters differently. News releases announcing the reimposition of the use 
tax were sent to the media. Travel agencies also have been notified and posters 
were supposed to be sent to airports around the state. 
</P>
<P>
The new statements, still under preparation, will also explain how travelers 
can claim exemptions, the most common of which are gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Exemptions are based on the retail values of the goods where they were 
purchased, not their U.S. values. To be exempt, travelers must have been out of 
the United States for at least 48 hours and must not have claimed an exemption 
within the last 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
On returning from Canada within 48 hours, there is only a $25 exemption per 
person. On returning from Mexico, the exemption is $400 if the stay was less 
than 48 hours, but the 30-day limitation still applies. 
</P>
<P>
Those coming back from a U.S. territory, such as the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam 
or American Samoa, will find the exemption raised, as of Sept. 4, from $400 to 
$800. But more than half of the goods must have been purchased in the U.S. 
possession to get the higher $800 exemption. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you've been on a Caribbean cruise and purchased $600 worth of 
goods on the Dutch island of Curacao and $200 on St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands. Your exemption on the Curacao-bought items would be $400, with a total 
exemption on the St. Thomas goods. 
</P>
<P>
The head of a family can still make a joint declaration for all members of his 
or her family (if living in the same household). This means that a family of 
four (even with two minors) can bring in $1,600 worth of items without paying 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
While customs requires you to declare the estimated value of all goods, 
including gifts, the use tax only covers purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the problems with the use tax," said Susan Tanzman-Kaplan, 
president of the Southern California chapter of the American Society of Travel 
Agents. "What if people bring back gifts that make the value of their goods go 
over $400, the amount on which you start paying duty? The customs form doesn't 
have space to separate purchases from gifts." 
</P>
<P>
One of the loopholes in enforcement of the use tax is returning to the United 
States from a non-California gateway, then taking a connecting flight to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't initially be monitoring out-of-state gateways, but we're talking 
about reciprocal arrangements with other areas," said Dennis Fox, another board 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible way to skirt the use tax comes through the Generalized System 
of Preferences (GSP). Under this program, the United States aids developing 
nations by allowing some of their products to be brought in duty-free. These 
items must be purchased in the country that produced them. 
</P>
<P>
More than 70 destinations around the world are affiliated with this program, 
including Antigua, Brazil, Congo, Costa Rica, Egypt, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan, 
the Philippines, Turkey and Uganda. Products range from jewelry and furniture 
to chinaware and carvings. Customs provides a free brochure, "GSP &amp; the 
Traveler," which explains the program. 
</P>
<P>
Some relief from the use tax may soon emerge. A bill (SB2455), introduced by 
State Sen. Rebecca Morgan (R-Menlo Park), would decrease the impact of the use 
tax by exempting travelers from the first $400 in goods. In effect, counting 
the $400 that already doesn't have to be itemized, this would spare consumers a 
use tax on $800 ($1,200 from U.S. possessions and territories). 
</P>
<P>

state Board of Equalization's Occasional Sales Unit, 1725 23rd St., Sacramento 
94287-0001, (916) 445-9524.

<P>
Mature travelers who enjoy combining travel with education will appreciate the 
program offered by ElderFolk, a fast-growing program founded in 1984 by the 
Oregon-based Folkways Institute. 
</P>
<P>
ElderFolk is designed for adults age 55 and older, and is described as a 
"school without walls" because, unlike many study programs for seniors that 
take place on college campuses in the United States and abroad, ElderFolk 
provides on-site lectures, discussions and individual exploration in the 
countries visited. 
</P>
<P>
Programs are designed to be economical while still providing participants the 
opportunity to explore other cultures by direct contact with local citizens. 
</P>
<P>
ElderFolk programs vary in length and do not require any specific education 
level or previous knowledge of the areas visited. There are no textbooks, 
homework or study preparation. 
</P>
<P>
The Folkways Institute has scheduled more than 15 tours for the remainder of 
1990 and through 1991, with other destinations to be added. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of the types of tours and subject matter includes: "Discover the 
Agean" (Greece and Turkey), emphasizing the region's influence on the modern 
world, May 3-24, 1991, $2,160; "Back Country Hawaii," devoted to an ecological, 
cultural and geological overview of the Big Island of Hawaii, Jan. 11-20, 1991, 
$1,260, and "Myanmar (Burma), Rangoon to Inle Lake," focusing on the natural 
and cultural wonders of the Republic of Myanmar, Feb. 6-22, 1991, $2,325. 
</P>
<P>
The free ElderFolk catalogue contains details of the philosophy and background 
of the Folkways Institute and a brief description of all of the tours scheduled 
for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
For the listing of tours or a copy of the catalogue, write Folkways Institute, 
14600 S.E. Aldridge Road, Portland, Ore. 97236-6518, or call (800) 225-4666. 
</P>
<P>
Mature travelers make up a high percentage of passengers on freighters, 
according to a spokesman for the Cruise &amp; Freighter Travel Assn. 
Flexibility is the key to freighter travel since the vessels' schedules are 
dictated by the cargo on board and any that might be picked up along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Newer freighters are being constructed with the express intent of carrying 
passengers, too, and cabins are increasingly more spacious and better 
decorated. One new freighter, Ivaran Lines' Americana, can book 88 passengers, 
although most freighters offering service from the United States carry a 
maximum of 12. 
</P>
<P>
The Cruise &amp; Freighter Travel Assn. has published a free booklet entitled, 
"35 Most Commonly Asked Questions About Freighter Travel." It tells about 
length of trips, shipboard activities, possible destinations, food service, 
language problems on foreign carriers, accommodations, health requirements, 
fares and discounts, booking procedures and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
For a free copy of the booklet, write to the Cruise &amp; Freighter Travel 
Assn., P.O. Box 218, Flushing, N.Y. 11358, or call (800) 872-8584 during normal 
business hours. 
</P>
<P>
Mature travelers who are considering a trip to the Hawaiian Islands this year 
can benefit from what are called "Prime Time Perks" -- fringe benefits offered 
by Island Holidays Tours to persons over age 60. Bonus features may include 
tours, special amenities or upgrades at certain properties. 
</P>
<P>
Island Holidays is a large tour operator that specializes in Hawaii and offers 
cruises, tours and resort hotel rooms and condominium rentals throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
For travelers who wish simply to book room reservations in Hawaii, Island 
Holidays has arrangements with 35 hotels in Waikiki, as well as with resorts 
and condominiums on Maui, Kauai and the Big Island. The company is able to 
supplement room rentals with discounted air transportation, airport transfers, 
day-tours and car rentals. 
</P>
<P>
Also offered are so-called "supersavers" that include one or more islands. For 
example, the Super Saver Waikiki/Oahu provides round-trip air transportation 
from Los Angeles, airport transfers, flower lei greeting, seven nights' hotel 
and a welcome breakfast for $512 per person, based on two persons in a room, 
effective Jan. 1 to March 31. From April 1 to Dec. 14, deduct $40 per person. 
</P>
<P>
A three-island trip includes Oahu, Kauai and Maui for nine days and provides 
round-trip air from the West Coast, lei greeting, three-day car rental on both 
Maui and Kaui and inter-island transportation. Cost for this package begins at 
$814 per person, double occupancy, and will vary according to the type of hotel 
or condo desired and the season selected for travel. 
</P>
<P>

YOUTH BEAT: JAUNTS NOW AVAILABLE TO OTAGO BIRD PRESERVES

<P>
New Zealand is ideal for nature lovers, with nearly 20% of the countryside 
under some form of protection. One of the interesting areas is the tip of the 
Otago Peninsula near Dunedin on New Zealand's South Island, where travelers can 
visit the Royal Albatross colony and Penguin Place. 
</P>
<P>
The budget traveler who is interested in the South Island of New Zealand and 
its popular albatross and penguin colonies can arrange for minivan 
transportation at the Stafford Gables youth hostel in Dunedin. 
</P>
<P>
Without the minivan ride, travelers would have to supply their own 
transportation or join a tour. They would also be faced with a five-mile hike 
from the bus stop at Portobello to the Royal Albatross colony at Taiaroa Head. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid disturbing the wildlife at the colony, which is close to civilization, 
the number of visitors is restricted. Before travelers go, they should get 
details at the hostel and arrange for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Pick a windy day for the best sightings, because the albatross need a 15- to 
20-knot wind to get airborne. At the site there is a reception building with 
information. 
</P>
<P>
At nearby Penguin Place, after paying a small entrance fee, visitors can see 
"yellow-eyed" penguins and "fur" seals. Best sightings are after 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The minivan for guests at Stafford Gables in Dunedin, second largest city on 
South Island, operates from October to April. 
</P>
<P>
Open all day, the hostel is at 71 Stafford St. The telephone number is (024) 
741-919. It has family, twin and dormitory accommodations from about $9.50 per 
night. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of 50 hostels in New Zealand affiliated with the International 
Youth Hostel Federation. In addition, there are 75 independent facilities 
referred to as "backpackers accommodation," which offer beds in small dormitory 
rooms, plus twin and double rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Rates for these facilities range from $5 to $9.50 per night, with no age 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand also has 12 national parks on the North and South islands, the 
largest being Fiordland with 3 million acres. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the availability of all these parks, one of the most popular 
pastimes in New Zealand is walking or hiking. Walks can range from an afternoon 
in a Kauri forest to several days exploring lush rain forests and alpine 
passes. In Fiordland, there are more than 300 miles of developed trails. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of walking alone, arrangements can be made to walk with a group. Only a 
day-pack is needed because meals and bedding are prearranged at lodges each 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers also can participate in "freedom walking" -- carrying their own food 
and sleeping bags and paying only for use of backcountry huts and 
transportation to and from the trailheads. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout New Zealand there are more than 850 huts that provide simple shelter 
with mattresses, bunks and cooking facilities, for $2.50 to $8 per night. 
</P>
<P>
The best time to hike is October to March. Holiday crowds arrive in January and 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers will find much information about South Island in a new 446-page 
edition of the "New Zealand Handbook" by Jane King, which contains 81 maps. It 
costs $14.95, was printed by Moon Publications and is available at major 
bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
For more information and brochures, contact the New Zealand Tourist &amp; 
Publicity Office, 10960 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1530, Los Angeles 90024, (800) 
388-5494 or (213) 477-8241.

ARABISM: SADDAM HUSSEIN IS BUT THE LATEST MIDDLE EAST LEADER WHO WOULD UNITE 
THE LONG-DIVIDED ARAB WORLD -- AND TIME IS ON HIS SIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
The unrealized dream of a unified Arab world is a potent and enduring force in 
Arab politics. To the outsider, however, this may seem off: The Arab people are 
victimized, first and foremost, by their own governments and leaders. Many 
Arabs enthusiastically agree. But they would add that the source of the problem 
lies in the drive of the outsider to divide, manipulate and weaken the Arab 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, until the 20th Century, borders meant very little in the Middle East. 
Historically, it was the city, not the state, that was the significant 
political unit. Even today, when an Arab traveller indicates he is en route to 
Cairo or Damascus, the words he uses could also be translated to mean "Egypt" 
or "Syria." The territorial states that have emerged were literally innovations 
imposed by Euorpeans. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein, like aspiring Arab nationalists before him, promises to shape 
the region along Arab lines and to thwart efforts to keep the Arab world 
divided unto itself. Although his promises sound cynical and transparently 
self-serving, it would be wrong to dismiss the power of his words. The longer 
the Iraqi leader is able to hold out against the world, the more credible his 
calls for widespread Arab support will become. The well-worn vernacular of Arab 
nationalism may be his most effective weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Arab nationalism -- the idea that the Arabs constitute a single distinctive 
nation united by a history and a common language -- emerged only in the latter 
half of the 19th Century. But it was not transformed into effective political 
programs until the post-World War II era, when the Arabs broke free of their 
European masters. 
</P>
<P>
The ideal of Pan-Arabism is reflected in the voting rules of the Arab League, 
which call for decision-making by consensus. In the continuing Persian Gulf 
crisis, the rule has been set aside, a measure of the strength of the response 
evoked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
It is no accident that minorities -- Christians and heretical Muslims -- have 
often been enthusiastic proponents of Arab nationalism. By appealing to a 
universal identity, they hope to mask the qualities that make them different. 
In the government-controlled press of Iraq and Syria, the sectarian groups that 
make up society are virtually never discussed, except as anti-Arab enemies of 
the nation. Hafez Assad of Syria, whose Alawite sect accounts for less than 15% 
of Syria's population, claims his country to be the beating heart of Arab 
nationalism, of which he is its leading advocate. 
</P>
<P>
In Iraq, the politically dominant Sunni Muslims make up less than 25% of the 
population but, buttressed by Baathism (Arab renaissance), Hussein emphasizes 
his nationalist credentials, not his sectarian ones. In reality, both countries 
are more like rival family businesses than governments. 
</P>
<P>
The ideology that underpins each regime is drawn from Baathism, which advocates 
the creation of a larger Arab nation as the ultimate expression of freedom. 
Damascus and Baghdad each claim to be Baathism's authentic voice. In both 
capitals, Syria and Iraq are formally described as merely regions of the larger 
Arab nation. In practice, Syria has shown no desire to extend its influence to 
Iraq. But Iraq -- larger, richer, more powerful -- has shown no such reticence. 
</P>
<P>
Baathism has a significant following in Lebanon, as well as in the Arab states 
of the Persian Gulf. Reportedly, the pro-Iraq branch of the party has made 
significant inroads into Mauritania, where Iraq has spread dinars generously 
and built a base of popular support. Mauritania may be important as a site for 
the testing of Iraqi rocket missiles, so there is a practical basis for this 
far-afield effort to spread the word according to Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nasserism 
</P>
<P>
No Arab leader has been able to duplicate the appeal of President Gamal Abdul 
Nasser of Egypt, whose emotional speeches moved an Arab generation. The 
high-water mark of his influence came in 1958, when Syria fused with Egypt to 
become the United Arab Republic. This experiment in unification ended three 
years later, when Egyptian control began to wear away and the Syrians grew 
weary of playing junior partner. 
</P>
<P>
Even after his catastrophic defeat in the Six Day War in 1967, Nasser 
maintained his grip on the political soul of the Arab world, where he was 
simply referred to as al-raais (the president). Once asked to define the Arab 
nation, he answered that it ends where his propaganda no longer arouses an 
echo. Nasser's dreams were put to rest by his successor, Anwar Sadat, who 
concluded that rhetoric would not feed Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
The man who proclaimed himself heir to Nasserism was Moammar Kadafi, the 
unguided missile who has led Libya for the past 20 years and whom President 
Sadat once described as being "crazy in the head." Kadafi is the undisputed 
record holder for the most numerous schemes to unify the Arab world. During his 
reign, he has signed unification agreements with four Arab states -- Egypt, 
Morocco, Tunisia and Syria. It is widely presumed that it is not Kadafi's 
personal magnetism that attracts partners, but his money. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his many memorable remarks, the Libyan leader noted, after signing 
the unification agreement with Syria in 1980: "Either Libya turns into a 
unionist state and merges with Syria and bears the losses of the Arab nation, 
or I shall go to the Galilee as a commando myself with my rifle." Commando 
Moammar was never spotted in northern Israel, but the abortive Syrian-Libyan 
merger did enliven a few political poster collections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greater Syria 
</P>
<P>
The states of the Fertile Crescent -- Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon -- were 
created, with some reluctance, by Britain and France out of the spoils of World 
War I. Britain, most especially France, aimed to hold onto the Arab mandates 
they were granted by the League of Nations in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
With its large Christian community, Lebanon was a natural ally of France, so 
Paris carved liberal chunks out of Syria to create what was hoped to be a 
viable "Greater Lebanon." The added areas, of course, were inhabited by 
fast-growing Muslim communities, which would outnumber Christians within a few 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
The Syrian state is technically younger than that of Lebanon. But Syria is a 
venerable place name -- cited even in the Bible. The geographical excisions 
performed by France did not heal well. Instead, they have kept the idea alive, 
among some Syrians, that Lebanon is properly a part of Syria. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a Greater Syria -- including Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine -- as a 
geographical and cultural unit has reverberated in Arab politics for decades. 
It was enthusiastically promoted by King Abdallah, the ruler of Jordan and the 
grandfather of King Hussein, until his assassination in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Syria gave birth to the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, which ven includes the 
island of Cyprus in its definition of Greater Syria. The party, a rival to the 
Baath party, is illegal in Syria, but it still counts a few thousand adherents 
in Lebanon, which is a political museum of Middle East parties and movements. 
</P>
<P>
President Assad's frequent reference to Syria as the "beating heart of Arab 
nationalism" is not without reason. Damascus was the principal setting for much 
of the formative writing on Pan-Arabism, and Assad has been true to that 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
But during his 20-year tenure as Syrian president, Assad has sought to 
establish a loose association of pliant regimes atop of which he would 
skillfully, but quietly, call the important shots. Assad's dream has been 
frustrated by Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Greater Iraq? 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that Hussein sees himself as a man of history -- indeed, a 
redeemer of history. As one of his Iraqi admirers said recently, Iraqi leaders 
200 years from now want their people to look back on the era of Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
In large measure, the Iraqi president owes his rise to regional prominence to 
the revolution in non-Arab Iran. Following the fall of the Shah, it was feared 
that the self-styled "Islamic Revolution" of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini would 
lurch across the Middle East like a crazed behemoth; Iraq quickly emerged as 
the state that could tame the beast. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, of course, had his own problems with the new regime in Iran. Over half 
of Iraq's population is Shiite Muslim, and in the fervor of the moment, it was 
thought that the appearance of the revolution might prove overwhelming to him. 
As it turned out, the ayatollah's dream of exporting the revolution proved 
easier said than done. It foundered in Iraq and, over time, even in 
disintegrating Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Seizing upon the chaos and disorganization gripping revolutionary Iran, Hussein 
invaded in September, 1980. His goal was to redraw his border with Iran, 
thereby grabbing the rich, Arab-inhabited oil fields of Khuzistan. Among 
Hussein's firmest supporters -- in addition to the United States, France and 
Britain -- was the Emirate of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
A cursory glance at a map of the gulf indicates the significance of Kuwait to 
Hussein. Even if the tiny state were not awash in oil, it would still be a key 
geographic impediment to Iraq's access to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein has not, of course, invented Iraq's claims on Kuwaiti territory. Since 
Kuwait's independence in 1961, Iraq has towered over its tiny neighbor like a 
sullen bully. In 1961, an Iraqi invasion was only forestalled by the prompt 
intervention of the British; in 1973, the Kuwaiti prime minister was bluntly 
told that Iraq would not recognize Kuwait's independence unless it agreed to 
cede the oil-rich and strategically located islands of Warda and Bubiyan. Iraq 
enforced her claims by unilaterally deploying soldiers on Kuwaiti territory. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, Hussein's dream of a greater Iraq is checked by an 
international consensus. But he is, as the Arab proverb advises, a man who will 
kiss a dog in order to take something from it. His remarkable opening to Iran 
has already produced a restoration of diplomatic relations and a modest breach 
in the economic blockade. Clearly, it would be a great mistake to underestimate 
him, or the appeal of his nationalist message. 
</P>
<P>
Pan-Arabism may be a delusion, but men have chased delusions throughout 
history, often with disastrous consequences. Arbitrary borders, autocratic 
government and political failure combine to form potent negative evidence of 
the cost of division and the failure of the Arab world to successfully confront 
Israel. Hussein offers to rectify this. 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that many, but by no means all, Arab governments resist 
and resent his offer. But Arabs living under oppression and in privation are a 
natural support base for Hussein; it was entirely predictable that stateless 
Palestinians would find inspiration in his words of Arab nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
Since the death of Nasser, the Arab world has been waiting for a hero. Others 
-- Assad, Kadafi -- have tried out for the role and failed. Now it is Hussein's 
turn. The longer he succeeds in frustrating the efforts of George Bush and 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the more difficult it will become for his Arab opponents 
to stand shoulder to shoulder with his enemies. Delusion or not, the dream of 
an Arab nation is a powerful one, and it looks as though Hussein will wield the 
dream more skillfully than his opponents have presumed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Four Unfulfilled Dreams: The vision of one Arab nation united by a common 
history and language has been a driving force in Arab politics. In part, the 
region's history since World War II can be told in a series of maps reflecting 
how successive Arab leaders would realize that dream. 
</P>
<P>
Nasser's Dream: Egypt and Syria 
</P>
<P>
Saddam's Dream: Iran, Kuwait, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and 'Palestine' 
</P>
<P>
Assad'd Dream: Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and 'Palestine' 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's Dream: Iran, Southern Iraq, Lebanon, Kuwait, Gulf coast of Saudi 
Arabia and Bahrain

<TEXT>
<P>
Will Europe manage it this time? Will World War II and the Cold War finally 
lead to a Europe at peace with itself and the world? The new Europe has a new 
flag, and it is everywhere in Brussels: 12 yellow stars on a field of deep blue 
on public buildings, on license plates, on T shirts. The bustling office 
buildings of this ancient city are filled with a new breed of Eurocrats: 
officials putting together one after another of the directives that, by the end 
of 1992, are expected to make one common market out of the European Community's 
12 member nations. 
</P>
<P>
Brussels hasn't always been this peaceful. Three centuries ago the armies of 
Louis XIV blasted much of the city into rubble. Only 50 years ago Adolf 
Hitler's Panzers smashed across the Belgian frontier, knocking out the defenses 
within hours and beginning five years of occupation that older Belgians still 
remember with bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
That Germany, 50 years after the blitz, is on the march is only one of Europe's 
fears and perhaps not the most alarming. Europe is trying to believe that the 
Germans learned something in the 20th Century: to remain firmly committed to 
the prosperous paths of peace rather than the costly and destructive process of 
nationalist self assertion. That the EC exists at all today is a tribute to the 
new German leaders who emerged after the war. Germany has long been the most 
loyal and generous member of the European Community and its representatives 
today are busy assuring its neighbors that, in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's words, 
the new superstate wants "a European Germany, not a German Europe." 
</P>
<P>
But Germany is the center of Europe, not its frontier, and from the lands 
beyond come warnings of new storms ahead. Travelers returning from the East, 
including officials of various Western governments as well as prominent private 
citizens with great experience in Eastern Europe, speak of disintegration, 
chaos and possibly war. The old institutions and authorities of the East have 
broken down, but it is not clear whether they will be replaced by anything 
better in the long run. The economic problems of the East, according to these 
observers, are far deeper and more critical than the West yet understands. Some 
expect to see real hunger in Poland, possibly next winter; experienced 
observers not given to hyperbole speak openly of civil war in Yugoslavia 
breaking out. 
</P>
<P>
The full extent of Eastern Europe's problems are only beginning to appear. In 
the first flush of revolutionary enthusiasm, these nations hoped that the 
consequences of throwing off the communist yoke would be rapid economic 
improvements and generous Western aid. Now disillusionment is setting in on 
both fronts. The formerly communist societies of the East are not ready for 
market economies. Reports from Western intelligence and financial institutions 
speak of three to five years of recession and worse in the reforming economies, 
followed by upturns in the mid-'90s. 
</P>
<P>
Problems are serious and structural, and unlikely to fade away. Transportation 
is a shambles; communication a disaster. Some Eastern countries are virtually 
cut off from the outside with only a handful of phone lines. Factories have 
outdated equipment and cannot be managed profitably in a capitalist economy. 
</P>
<P>
The market successes in Eastern Europe have been small scale: Poland is one 
vast flea market but bazaars don't make countries rich. If they did, Istanbul 
would be the financial center of the world. 
</P>
<P>
The rapidity with which farmers, restaurateurs and others have moved to take 
advantage of new openings testifies to the entrepreneurial spirit of Eastern 
Europe. But there is a long way between a flea market and a modern competitive 
industrial and electronic economy. Almost nobody in the East knows how to 
project a cash flow or depreciate an asset. No one knows how to market a brand, 
float a stock issue or set a price in a competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
The aid from the West is falling short of expectations, and the Eastern 
countries are proving unable to use much of what is offered. Perhaps misled by 
Western anti-communist rhetoric, Eastern Europeans believed the proclamations 
from places like Brussels and Washington about undying solidarity with those 
trapped behind the Iron Curtain. It turns out solidarity came more from the 
heart than the pocketbook. Increasing frustration characterizes the dealings of 
East Europeans with their Western counterparts as request after request for 
assistance goes unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Western donors are almost equally frustrated. The East is so 
disorganized, its economy so chaotic and the pool of trained managers able to 
function in a capitalist setting so small, that private and public aid agencies 
are often unable to find viable projects to fund. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the more people know about Eastern Europe today, the more 
pessimistic they are. "Skepticism, pessimism, alienation." That is how one of 
the West's most knowledgeable observers characterized the situation in 
Bulgaria. "It's hard to project a country, much less a trend," said a Western 
diplomat familiar with conditions in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Talks with experts from East and West elicit comments like this about every 
country in the bloc. Chaos and fear in Romania; confusion and doubt in Hungary; 
strife and urgency in Poland; the harsh realities of 1990 are sweeping aside 
the promise of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The worst stories come out of the Soviet Union, where travelers returning from 
districts off the beaten path tell of living conditions reminiscent of the 
slums of Cairo and of political conditions like those of late Ceausescu 
Romania. In parts of the Soviet Union, citizens tell foreigners that they 
admire what the Romanians did to Ceausescu and his unpopular wife, and that 
such measures might not be amiss in the Soviet Union. From czarism to 
anarchism, the Soviet peoples are resurrecting old ideologies in the wake of 
the communist collapse. It gets harder and harder to see how the country will 
emerge from its current condition without shedding torrents of blood. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty in the Soviet Union isn't just bad news for the Soviets. It is 
almost impossible to imagine how Eastern Europe can prosper if the Soviet Union 
sinks into anarchy. The Soviet Union is the most important trading partner for 
all of Eastern Europe. Without its markets and its raw materials the outlook 
for the former satellites would be even bleaker. Furthermore, Western investors 
will be reluctant to commit large sums of money to Eastern Europe as long as 
the Soviet picture is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
There is one subject, though, that Soviets and Eastern Europeans remain 
optimistic about: Brussels. Membership in the European Community is the way to 
solve their problems. Brussels will rebuild economies and safeguard 
democracies. 
</P>
<P>
This is a lot of faith to put in Belgian-based bureaucrats who spend most of 
their time doing things like standardizing sugar beet quotas, but Eastern 
Europeans have always been noted for faith. In Brussels, meanwhile, the 
bureaucrats go on fine tuning the mechanisms of economic cooperation, but the 
road to European union is rocky and long. Nobody knows when or if the 
star-spangled banner of Brussels will stand for something more than a pious 
wish or how many stars it will ultimately have. But to think that Western 
Europe can enjoy peace and prosperity while the Eastern half of the Continent 
writhes in agony and misery is to open the door to new dictators and new 
threats -- "Hitlersky," as one, only half facetious diplomat put it, more 
dangerous and more violent than anything Europe has faced in its long and 
bloody history.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had last been at the Shanghai Airport in 1979. Not much has changed. The 
baggage claim area is dark and dingy. Young men in military uniforms wander 
about arguing, having nothing else to do. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as I left the airport, however, I began to see China had changed 
dramatically. Unimaginable numbers of people still clog the streets. But the 
depressing conformity conveyed by the sea of blue and grey Mao jackets has 
given way to a buoyant stream of color and fashion. Modern buildings dot the 
skyline in many cities. Passers-by now eye Westerners with curiosity, but then 
go on their way. In 1979, I was usually followed by 50 or more, all bewildered 
by their first contact with a foreigner. 
</P>
<P>
China is no longer in isolation. With the political and economic reforms of the 
1980s, the Chinese became part of the international community. The success of 
this decade of transition -- economic gains, new diplomatic and academic 
contacts, political liberalization -- made the violent repression of the 
student movement on June 4, 1989, more painful for the Chinese. "Not only has 
reform ground to a halt," one student told me, "we're actually moving 
backward." 
</P>
<P>
I was invited to China in the spring to give a series of lectures on 
international politics. The itinerary included a hectic week of meetings in 
major cities as well as a leisurely week of travel in more remote regions. For 
this, my rusty Chinese proved indispensable, few speak English outsie the 
coastal cities. Virtually everyone I met wanted to talk about June 4 and how it 
changed their lives. Nor were these casual chats. People spoke with an urgency, 
a passion. The fearful events of June 4 stirred up powerful currents of 
discontent that have yet to subside. Massive opposition to the government runs 
strong beneath the illusive surface of calm. 
</P>
<P>
The student movement captured the hearts and minds of much of the urban 
population, despite continuing debate over exactly what the students were 
after. The ambiguity of the movement actually proved to be the key to its 
popularity -- everyone identified the objectives of the movement with his own 
specific grievances. 
</P>
<P>
For intellectuals, the movement was about democracy -- a catch-all phrase that 
stood for political liberalization. Beijing University students who 
participated in the demonstrations admitted to me that they took to the streets 
without mapping out their objectives and how to attain them. But they agreed 
that freedom of expression and accountability were the unifying themes. "Our 
main aim," one graduate student put it, "was to express our frustrations openly 
and to demand government officials start being held responsible for their 
actions." 
</P>
<P>
For workers, the movement was about fighting inflation and corruption. During 
the second half of the 1980s, high inflation had been eating away at living 
standards and pervasive corruption only made matters worse. A worker from 
Sichuan Province explained: "The corruption is so bad that it now touches 
everyone. Bribing officials has become a way of life. It was the students' 
demand for an end to corruption that linked the workers to the democracy 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
For the older generation, the movement was of symbolic importance; the specific 
grievances addressed were less significant than the message that students were 
sending. "The student demonstrations restored my faith in China's youth," a 
woman in her 60s told me. "Before, I thought students just wanted to dance and 
prepare their language exams in order to study abroad. I thought they did not 
care about the country. Now, I am hopeful about the younger generation." 
</P>
<P>
Sympathy for the student movement, pervasive in China's coastal cities, begins 
to wane in the country's rural interior. About two hours southwest of Kunming, 
not far off the highway that runs from Yunnan's capital to Burma, I pulled over 
to chat with farmers sweeping up grain they had left on the road to be threshed 
by the tires of passing cars. 
</P>
<P>
After the necessary discussion of this year's crop, I turned to the student 
movement. The peasants said they had supported the demonstrations until the 
imposition of martial law. "After that," one said, "the students had to be 
stopped to prevent turmoil and chaos from spreading all over the country." This 
was the same line the government had presented on the television news. "What do 
you expect?" a student in Kunming said. "The farmers are very isolated from the 
cities. Forty percent of Yunnan is illiterate. Most people have no reason not 
to believe what they hear on TV." 
</P>
<P>
Lack of sophistication, however, is not the only explanation for the more 
conservative attitudes of the countryside. The farmers have economic incentives 
for supporting the status quo: Many benefitted enormously from economic 
reforms. Workers in cities, in fact, are beginning to resent the growing 
economic disparities between urban centers and countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Peasants and government officials were not the only ones fearful that the 
student movement might lead to political chaos. Many intellectuals who 
supported the students' objectives questioned their methods. For those who had 
experienced the violence of the Cultural Revolution, the demonstrations 
conjured up terrifying images. "I lived through the Cultural Revolution," an 
intellectual in his 50s said. "It was out of control. The damage to China was 
great. We cannot live through that again." Another scholar agreed that the 
situation in Beijing bordered on chaos. "How would the U.S. government react," 
he asked, "if hundreds of thousands of people surrounded the White House and 
brought the center of Washington to a standstill for several weeks?" 
</P>
<P>
This fear of disorder is not simply a product of the Cultural Revolution and 
other excesses of the Mao era. It is grounded in a more fundamental 
appreciation of the challenge involved in maintaining political order in China. 
Before the Communist Revolution in 1949, the country suffered through decades 
of economic and political fragmentation. Many Chinese view the establishment of 
centralized authority as one great achievement of the Mao era. "We live in a 
country of 1.1 billion people," a recent graduate of Beijing University told 
me. "Except for a few roads and rail lines, our interior provinces are cut off 
from the coastal cities. Feeding and keeping control of the country are very 
difficult. If we push for radical change, we will only end up worse off." 
</P>
<P>
Intellectuals who led the demonstrations acknowledge that change must come 
slowly to China. but they disagree that the students went too far. "What are we 
supposed to do, write a letter to Deng?" a student at Fudan University in 
Shanghai said, "Demonstrations are our only means of expressing opposition." 
</P>
<P>
The government's continuing efforts to suppress overt opposition has made life 
more unpleasant for many Chinese. Academics and journalists have been hit the 
hardest. They face increased supervision, harassment and, sometimes, arrest. 
</P>
<P>
On the campuses, organized opposition to the government has been virtually 
eliminated. At Beijing University, a few students were reading on the grassy 
area next to the statue of Cervantes, where the democracy movement was born 
last spring. The wall once covered by pro-democracy posters sported 
advertisements for dances and films. "We sometimes gather in the dorms in 
groups of three or four to talk about the democracy movement," one student 
said. "But that's it." 
</P>
<P>
The general populace has suffered too. Virtually everyone faces more frequent 
and intrusive political education classes at the work place. Public discourse 
has become sterile; searching debates that, before the crackdown, took place in 
parks and newspapers have moved behind closed doors. Economic conditions have 
also worsened. The government has instituted an austerity program to bring down 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The violence used to extinguish the student movement and the less hospitable 
environment that emerged thereafter have taken a spiritual toll. Confusion and 
disorientation hang over the country. The reforms of the 1980s not only raised 
expectations, they indicated that the country was moving in a certain 
direction: towards a mixed economy, a more open relationship with the outside 
world and a more liberal domestic order. Now, many believe the country is 
floundering. Deng Xiaoping, the supporter of reform, has become the culprit 
behind the Tian An Men Square tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion about the present translates into uncertainty about the future. The 
hard-liners are now in control, but the current leadership is in dire straits. 
Rural residents -- some 70% of the population -- remain a source of support for 
the government. But the peasants are geographically and politically isolated 
from the center of power. It is the urban population that the government must 
placate -- a daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
June 4 stripped the government of whatever legitimacy it enjoyed after several 
years of rampant corruption. Ideological mobilization is no longer possible. I 
met no one who took the required political education classes seriously. Even a 
government official admitted, "We Chinese are now very cynical about ideology." 
Students have little interest in reading the works of Mao or Lenin and are 
instead turning to religion. Since June 4, studying Buddhism and Christianity 
has become a fad. 
</P>
<P>
Events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have only compounded the plight 
of the ruling elite. The government has failed in its effort to convince the 
Chinese people that the collapse of Communism is unique to the Soviet Bloc. On 
the contrary, it is Soviet-style reform that the Chinese people are hoping for. 
As a student at Beijing University put it, "We are waiting for Deng to die in 
the hope that we will get our Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
A joke now popular in China goes as follows: "We Chinese used to say, 'Only 
socialism can save China.' Now we say, 'Only China can save socialism.' " The 
cynical smiles that follow make clear that saving socialism is not a task for 
which much enthusiasm remains. There is indeed wistfulness over the failure of 
communism and appreciation that the party is responsible for saving millions of 
Chinese peasants from abject poverty. "Nevertheless," one young woman told me, 
"Communism is now seen as an ideal, a dream that will never come true."

CRISIS IN THE GULF: WHITE HOUSE SENDS QUAYLE TO SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE; 
</P>
<P>
VICE PRESIDENT: HE HOLDS HIS OWN ON A TRIP TO LATIN AMERICA, BUT IT'S ONCE OVER 
LIGHTLY, WITH LITTLE INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY OR ENGAGEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stanley Meisler, Stanley Meisler, a staff writer in The Times' Washington 
bureau, has served several tours as a Times foreign correspondent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since the first few days of the Iraqi crisis, when he was photographed 
studiously and intently at the side of President Bush in Camp David, little has 
been heard or seen of Vice President Dan Quayle. That is not surprising. 
Throughout American history, vice presidents have had little to do when it 
really mattered. 
</P>
<P>
During the Administration of President Lyndon Johnson, singer Tom Lehrer would 
delight his fans with a comic ditty about "what ever happened to Hubert 
Humphrey," the ignored vice president. As political satirist Finley Peter 
Dunne's Mr. Dooley put it almost a century ago: "Th' vice-prisidincy . . . 
isn't a crime exactly. Ye can't be sint to jail f'r it, but it's a kind iv a 
disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
For Quayle, however, there is a second problem. The press seems to have grown 
tired of him. When Quayle made his first foreign trip as vice president to 
Venezuela and El Salvador soon after inauguration, more than 70 correspondents 
accompanied him, many surely hoping to catch him in some gaffe. While not 
despised by his critics the way Nixon was during the 1950s, Quayle is probably 
the most belittled vice president in decades. 
</P>
<P>
Correspondents did catch the Vice president in some embarrassments in earlier 
trips. One memorable incident was his questionable taste in buying a blatantly 
virile doll at a souvenir shop in Valparaiso, Chile, in March this year. 
</P>
<P>
But editors soon decided that Quayle's mishaps really did not merit constant 
surveillance by the press, and the numbers of correspondents assigned to travel 
with the vice president dwindled. Only four correspondents went along with him 
on his latest trip to Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Haiti in 2 1/2 days in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
That was surely a mistake -- even though there was no news about Quayle making 
a fool of himself. The personable 43-year-old Quayle, in fact, has developed 
into a vice president who performs his tasks comfortably and confidently. 
</P>
<P>
On his August trip, Quayle demonstrated, first of all, that he evidently plays 
no greater role in the inner circles of power than any of his predecessors. The 
long-scheduled trip took Quayle out of Washington during some of the most 
dramatic moments in the Iraqi crisis. Since he had already taken part in the 
crucial White House meetings during the long weekend after the Iraqi invasion 
of Kuwait, Quayle insisted, "There was no reason for me to cancel this trip." 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was obvious that Quayle, though kept informed periodically by White 
House phone, had to fall a step or two behind developments because of his 
remoteness from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president, for example, received no advance text of President Bush's 
address to the nation that tried to explain the Middle East crisis and the 
American role in it. While Quayle breakfasted with Peruvian business leaders in 
Lima, his aides tried to transcribe the text from Cable News Network on a hotel 
TV screen. The White House, however, finally faxed a copy of the speech to 
Quayle before the breakfast ended. 
</P>
<P>
But, though he did not show it, Quayle must have been disappointed by the text. 
His aides were proud that President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela had 
promised Quayle a day before that his country and other members of the 
Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries would increase their oil 
production to make up the shortgages caused by the boycott of oil from Iraq and 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Yet President Bush, while hailing the important missions of Secretary of State 
James H. Baker III to Turkey and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to the Middle 
East, failed to even mention Quayle's diplomatic success with Perez. The 
omission seemed to underscore how the vice president was caught in a byway 
while key members of the Administration worked at the heart of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Despte this disappointment, Quayle accomplished his diplomatic tasks with ease 
and efficiency. Though he does not dominate a stage with either his oratory or 
prescence, the vice president can deliver the messages of the Bush 
Administration with competence and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
On this trip, he had to encourage the anti-drug programs of Colombia and 
Bolivia, solicit more drug cooperation from Peru, request increased oil 
production from Venezuela and lecture the military rulers of Haiti about 
democracy. Some of this required some delicacy. His anti-drug rhetoric in Peru 
seemed remote from reality in a country more concerned with "Fujishock" -- the 
spiraling price increases of President Alberto Fujimori's austerity program -- 
than anything else. His plea for democracy might have upset some Haitian 
officers. But the vice president, who speaks in a mild-mannered way without any 
trace of rancor or guile, did not try to hector the Peruvians or Haitians as 
laggards. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, though the vice president made no gaffes on this trip and performed his 
role with aplomb, he did exhibit a troubling weakness. Rushing through four 
different countries, he often acted as if he were a politician without much 
intellectual curiosity, without the enthusiasm to engage himself fully in a 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
This was most clearly reflected in his scheduling. The itinerary left Quayle 
with little time to do anything but hold news conferences, attend ceremonies, 
confer with officialdom and dine with the Establishment. In Haiti, for example, 
the vice president spent less than four hours and devoted all his time to 
meetings at one site, the presidential palace. His longest stop was 18 hours in 
Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this was explained by security. The Secret Service did not like the 
idea of Quayle passing his time in such terrorist zones as Peru and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
But it is also true that the 43-year-old Quayle, who has the stamina to move 
swiftly from one official appointment to another, does not like to schedule 
much more than ceremony and diplomacy on his trips. He does not feel the need 
to set aside time for sightseeing, absorbing culture or meeting with 
dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's whole manner changes, however, when he is engaged in a subject. Over 
Secret Service objections, his motorcade drove through the slums of Lima to a 
school for orphans run by the little San Pablo Presbyterian Church. Quayle's 
own Presbyterian Church in McLean, Va., had contributed to the upkeep of the 
school; Marilyn Quayle, in fact, headed one of the fund-raising drives. The 
vice president did not intend to stop in Lima without seeing the orphans. 
</P>
<P>
While the children, to the tune of "It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperrary," sang 
in Spanish, "We are Christians. Give us your hand. Long live our friendship," 
the vice president spent a half-hour touring the school, inspecting the stoves 
bought by his own church, chatting with the children and their teachers, and 
meeting with the pastor. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle later told American reporters that the chaos of Peru "certainly gets 
across to you just visiting Lima. Lima is a town that has the capabilities of 
providing for 2 million people, and yet 7 million people live there. You can't 
help but walk away having your eyes opened to the abject poverty that exists in 
Lima." 
</P>
<P>
The slum experience -- which might not have occurred had he not been pressured 
by his church and wife -- produced his most perceptive and committed analysis 
of the trip.

DARYL GATES' COMMENTS ON DRUG USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those were hard words uttered by Gates. The public outcry over his remarks is 
merely indicative, to me, of just how pervasive the use of illegal substances 
has become in our society. 
</P>
<P>
Drug-related murders, whether they be in Colombia or on the streets of Los 
Angeles, are a daily occurrence. Unfortunately, it is not always the 
drug-related who get killed. We cannot hope to win this war until the casual 
user wakes up to the fact that he/she is an accessory to murder under the law . 
. . the law of supply and demand. If the demand stopped, it would no longer be 
necessary to protect the lucrative commerce of supply. The responsibility for 
the killing lies not only in the hard-core street dealer, but at the upscale 
cocktail party where friends casually do a few lines; in the dormitory where 
the students relax with a joint; in the corporate high-rise office building 
where the board members pop a few pills to keep the edge. 
</P>
<P>
If Gates suggests fighting gunfire with gunfire, I couldn't possibly agree with 
him more. After all, that is what war is, isn't it?

<TEXT>
<P>
In all too many cases we have a drug policy being set by individuals with 
limited expertise in the field of alcoholism and other drug addictions. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Gates and many others would be surprised to learn that our patients are 
ordinary people (doctors, lawyers, teachers, nurses, etc.) whose lives have 
become unmanageable due to their dependence on alcohol and other drugs. The 
focus and benefit of treatment is to provide an opportunity for these 
individuals and their families to recover from chemical dependency and to 
repair the damage done to their lives. These individuals have the right to 
proper care and treatment.

<P>
Studies have repeatedly shown that the consumption and production of marijuana 
in the United States is on the decrease, and that criminalization costs society 
more in terms of increased law-enforcement-related costs and deprived revenues 
from taxes on pot than legalization would. 
</P>
<P>
The dangers of marijuana are fewer than such legal substances as tobacco and 
alcohol, and any crime and violence connected to it is a direct result of its 
criminalization. 
</P>
<P>
If it were not for demagogic political grandstanding of the "war on drugs" ilk, 
it would have been legal long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, our country's real drug problems grow unabated. Our current problems 
of drug-related crime, violence, deaths, disease and birth defects are 
primarily fueled by cocaine and crack, and to a lesser extent (as the number of 
addicts to those substances are lower than cocaine and crack) heroin and 
methamphetamine.

THE SHAME OF SERIOUS UNDERSTAFFING; 
</P>
<P>
BUREAUCRATIC BOTTLENECK DEVELOPING OVER TROUBLING REPORT ABOUT SAN ONOFRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been more than a year since a study concluded that the San Onofre 
Nuclear Generating Station is breaking federal law by killing tons of kelp and 
fish every year. This was no ordinary report. Funded by Southern California 
Edison, the research was a 15-year, $46-million review of the power plant's 
impact on the offshore environment. 
</P>
<P>
Ordered by the California Coastal Commission, the review determined that the 
plant has reduced the San Onofre kelp bed by 200 acres, or 60%. San Onofre's 
cooling system sucks up and kills 21 to 57 tons of fish a year, discharging the 
debris into the ocean and reducing the natural light levels on the ocean floor 
by as much as 16%. 
</P>
<P>
This is perhaps not an ecological disaster of the highest order, but certainly 
a matter for the commission's attention. And yet a year has gone by without a 
commission hearing on the report. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of those delays, the Water Quality Control Board -- the other 
agency empowered to force Edison to make changes -- has postponed its hearings 
on the matter three times. This despite an environmental lawyer's requests to 
revoke the plant's permit until Edison remedies the two reported violations. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of all this delay is the now familiar commission staff shortage. 
Staff scientists there simply don't have the time to review a study that the 
agency ordered 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
That state of affairs is, of course, traceable to Deukmejian Administration 
budget cuts. Staff at the commission has been reduced from 172 when Gov. 
Deukmejian took over to 110 today. An advisory panel on cost control found last 
year that the agency's budget had been reduced, in real terms, by 56% since 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
The November ballot is full of potential new protections for the environment. 
Forests, crops, the ozone layer, bays and estuaries would receive more help. 
Yet only the oil- spill-prevention provisions of Proposition 128 would add 
staff to the badly strapped commission, and those funds would pay for its new 
responsibilities. (The Legislature has enacted a similar new program). 
</P>
<P>
It's futile to scold Deukmejian again for his attitude toward the environment 
(except to remind him of the need to sign the bill that would provide the 
commission with new enforcement powers over those who damage the coastline.) 
The commission, which will ask for 37 new staffers and a budget increase of 
$3.1 million for fiscal 1991-92, must place its hope in the next governor. Both 
candidates have shown concern for the coast's future. 
</P>
<P>
While the electorate considers how far it wants to extend environmental 
safeguards, the state ought to find a way to help an existing watchdog -- the 
Coastal Commission -- do the job we established it to do.

DARYL GATES' COMMENTS ON DRUG USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although my initial reaction to Gates' assertion that all casual drug users 
"ought to be taken out and shot" was a combination of hilarity and outrage, I 
now realize that perhaps he's stumbled upon a brilliant solution to many of 
this city's most nagging problems. I assume that Gates' sweeping statement 
includes tobacco and alcohol users -- yes, even the casual ones -- since those 
drugs are arguably more harmful than marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
With all those users shot and eliminated from the landscape, just think of how 
spacious, uncongested and clean our city will become overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Let's raise a toast to . . . oops, I mean, um, let's drink a diet cola to 
celebrate Gates joining the likes of Ed Davis and Sam Yorty in the all-time Los 
Angeles Buffoonery Hall of Fame.

WHY PROTECTIONISM WILL BOOMERANG;

<P>
A CONCERNED SECRETARY OF STATE BAKER RIGHTLY IMPLORES CONGRESS NOT TO DO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is no time to send mixed signals when it comes to diplomacy and trade. The 
United States is forging a historic alliance to confront Iraqi aggression, but 
efforts in Washington to pass protectionist trade legislation are undermining 
our other international commitments. If Washington clings to parochial domestic 
interests, it risks the quid pro quo goodwill needed to loosen international 
restrictions that hurt U.S. trade abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives is scheduled this week for a crucial vote on a 
textile bill that would significantly strengthen three decades of existing 
protectionist quotas and make them permanent. The Senate already has 
overwhelmingly passed a similar measure that would severely restrict imports of 
textiles, apparel and footwear each year. The Bush Administration opposes the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
The textile and apparel industries already are heavily protected by about 1,000 
quotas established in 38 bilateral agreements negotiated under the 
international Multifiber Agreement. Two of those agreements involve Turkey and 
Egypt, countries adversely affected by economic sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In letter to the House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III expressed his concern that passage of the textile legislation "would 
compound the problems being faced by a number of countries which have stood 
with us in the (Persian) Gulf crisis despite the economic losses they have been 
incurring." 
</P>
<P>
The protectionist textile legislation threatens the Administration's commitment 
to bring the current round of international trade talks to a successful 
conclusion in December. The House and Senate also are working on a farm bill 
that would continue heavy subsidies to U.S. farmers. Both bills conflict with 
the goal of the trade talks: to reform restrictive trade practices and to 
create new trading rules for services and investments. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills echoed objections to the textile bill: 
"To pass such a piece of protectionistic legislation closing the U.S. market 
after 3 1/2 years of negotiating to open world markets will be seen as the 
height of hypocrisy -- in essence saying to the world 'do was we say, not as we 
do.' " 
</P>
<P>
The cost is not only to our trading reputation and partners but to U.S. 
consumers as well. Opponents estimate that the clothing costs for a family of 
four would increase about $500 over the next five years if the bill passes. The 
textile bill is simply the wrong idea at the wrong time.

DARYL GATES' COMMENTS ON DRUG USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Daryl Gates' obscene statement about shooting casual drug users 
(front page, Sept. 6): Why stop there, Daryl? 
</P>
<P>
This is a brilliant scenario! I wonder if this nut is in collusion with the 
National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Soon every casual user will have a gun. And the police officers themselves 
would have to be extremely fearful every time they pull someone over. I mean, 
if you're going to die for smoking a joint, why not just blow the cop away; at 
least there's a chance you might escape. 
</P>
<P>
No one in his right mind (not to be confused with right wing) advocates drug 
use. I have helped produce "Just Say No" segments for home video tapes and 
realize the importance of drug education, but what if some of our children do 
experiment? Should we shoot them? 
</P>
<P>
Our society's ills are twofold: poverty and the total collapse of our 
educational system. Drugs are merely an effect. If we begin to heal the cause, 
the effect will take care of itself.

BUT IN DEALING WITH HAFEZ ASSAD, WE MUST NOT PRETEND THAT HE HAS CHANGED HIS 
SPOTS.

It is no criticism of the Bush Administration to note that it has been driven 
by circumstances, persuaded by allies and tempted by short-range needs to 
accept -- even to solicit -- collaborators whose record and whose morality are 
no better than the enemy against whom we now mobilize. Franklin Roosevelt 
welcomed Josef Stalin into the alliance against Nazi Germany. Harry Truman 
included unpalatable regimes in the alliances he constructed to contain Stalin. 
Jimmy Carter accepted Omar Torrijos as his partner for Panama and Pakistan as a 
helpmate to turn back the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Ronald Reagan first 
"tilted" to Iraq and eventually sold weapons to Iran. Now, Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III and the Bush Administration seek to cement Syria into the 
coalition marshaled against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
World politics has forever driven governments to make alliances based on 
convenience and necessity as well as shared moral principles. It is generally 
believed that a government that wholly eschews Realpolitik can neither long 
play a significant role in world affairs nor serve its own moral goals. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing aggression, constructing new collective security arrangements, helping 
maintain independence and order, protecting world access to Middle East oil all 
require active collaboration with non-democratic governments, many of whose 
principles and practices do not meet Western standards. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible for the United States to pursue a politics of the greater good 
and the lesser evil and still remain true to fundamental American principles, 
providing that we face what we are doing and not pretend that our new, unsavory 
ally has suddenly changed his nature. 
</P>
<P>
Western governments still believe that it was reasonable to tilt toward Saddam 
Hussein's government when the Ayatollah Khomeini's forces threatened to defeat 
Iraq. But helping Hussein develop weapons of mass destruction was another 
matter. So was turning a blind eye to Iraq's use of poison gas against Iranians 
and Kurds. Realpolitik did not require that the United States and the West 
condemn Israel for the destruction of Iraq's nuclear reactor. To the contrary, 
realism required that the United States and the West face the fact that Israel 
was acting in self-defense and in the process benefiting the region. 
Realpolitik did not require or even permit the United States or others to 
pretend that Hussein had become "some sort of moderate by some sort of 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, because we did not warn Hussein against aggression but repeatedly 
affirmed that the United States had no alliance or commitment to Kuwait, 
Hussein had no opportunity to realistically assess the probable consequences of 
seizing Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Those errors are now behind us. But the mind-set responsible for them lives on 
and threatens now to distort American policy toward Syria, whose leader has 
killed as many people as Hussein has as brutally but more cleverly subverted 
and conquered a neighboring Arab nation, and who, moreover, has direct ties to 
terrorist attacks on Americans. 
</P>
<P>
It is the famous "Arabist" mind-set that is common in the State Department's 
Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs and in the foreign offices of Europe. The bureau 
is peopled by intelligent, industrious specialists on the language, culture, 
history and politics of the Arab World. Many of them have learned to view the 
world through the eyes of those whom they have studied and all too often have 
come to feel a unique indulgence toward Arab strongmen, a special irritation 
with Israel and a sense that U.S. concerns with democracy and human rights are 
not quite relevant to their area. 
</P>
<P>
This "clientism," often the other side of the coin of area expertise, distorts 
U.S. policy, especially with regard to Iraq, Syria, the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The same tendency that led the State Department to conclude that the PLO had 
renounced terrorism and ignored evidence of Hussein's impending aggression may 
lead it now to become more entangled with Hafez Assad than is either necessary 
or desirable. 
</P>
<P>
It may already have led them to underestimate the danger that violent PLO 
neighbors constitute for Israel and to recommend tacit, offstage linkage of the 
Israeli/Palestinian issue to the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
International politics may sometimes justify or even require an alliance with 
unpalatable leaders or regimes. It never justifies asking unreasonable risks of 
a democratic ally such as Israel or forgetting that the United States' 
permanent interests lie with democracy and the democracies.

PERSPECTIVE ON SOUTH AFRICA; 
</P>
<P>
BLOODSHED MOSTLY 'TURF,' NOT TRIBALISM; 
</P>
<P>
THE WHITE COMMUNITY MUST QUELL ITS FEARS AND GET TO WORK ON THE EQUALITY THAT 
WOULD ALLOW ALL TO PROSPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY HAZLITT HEARD, Anthony Hazlitt Heard was formerly editor of the Cape 
Times. His personal history of the South Africa crisis, The Cape of Storms, 
will be published this month by the University of Arkansas Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While experts discuss the causes of the carnage sweeping black townships in 
South Africa, the events themselves suggest that the country is moving rapidly 
toward a new order. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that, after a relative lull a few months ago, the violence has 
grown horrifically; recent studies show a death toll worse than in Northern 
Ireland, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Peru or Colombia. In addition, some of the 
security authorities appear to be exacerbating things by taking sides; the 
country's ruling white minority, already confused, is increasingly scared about 
sharing power with blacks, and there are signs that world opinion is taking a 
grim view of the democratic prospects in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Against this rather somber background, President F. W. de Klerk will be meeting 
President Bush in Washington on Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, if one stands back from the appalling events, some factors give cause for 
hope. The paradox is that South Africa may just be getting there, politically. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting has undeniable tribal overtones and is complicated by gangsterism 
and local disputes among bitter blacks, who are still without rights. But 
essentially the struggle is over delimitation of constituencies, as an astute 
observer, Dr. Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, former leader of the white opposition 
in Parliament, has pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
A huge battle for "turf" is being waged throughout Natal province, in townships 
in the Transvaal and in conflict areas such as Crossroads in the Cape. Blacks, 
denied political rights for generations, sense that they are about to win them 
and are battling it out to establish constituencies. It is a very crude way to 
"delimit" seats. But at least it involves looking more ahead than to the past. 
</P>
<P>
The Zulu factor is obviously of major significance. These militant people of 
Natal province, who last century adopted tactics of "total war" and scattered 
thousands of fellow blacks, are once again flexing their muscles. They are the 
most populous group in the country, and Inkatha, the political party of their 
formal political leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, claims a membership of 
nearly 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Determined not to be sidelined in Natal, Buthelezi is going for national power, 
possibly in an alliance with De Klerk's National Party. The renewed violence in 
Transvaal province coincided with his moves to extend Inkatha's influence 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the dominant black liberation movement, the African National 
Congress, is led mainly by people tracing their ancestry to the Xhosas of the 
Eastern Cape, historical rivals of the Zulus, gives the conflict a certain 
tribal edge -- but it is not a straight matter of Zulu versus Xhosa. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there has never been a major war between the Zulus and Xhosas, in 
spite of border incidents. Zulus have fought Zulus in Natal -- some backing the 
ANC and some Inkatha. 
</P>
<P>
Also, intermarriage and massive urbanization have done much to break down 
tribalism. The ANC includes Zulus in its leadership and was once led by a Zulu, 
the late Albert Lutuli. The violent picture is complicated by the drab poverty 
of the townships, massive black unemployment, rivalry between the ANC and the 
smaller, ideologically more radical Pan-Africanist Congress and petty fiefdoms 
battling it out. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it is De Klerk's reform process that has stirred things up by 
raising political aspirations. Generally speaking, the violence is not directed 
at the government, as in the past, but at other black groups. The government 
finds itself in the role of arbiter -- and to the extent that some elements of 
the security forces side with Inkatha, this role is tarnished, and peace 
prospects are diminished. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers would write South Africa off as another Lebanon, with mindless 
violence thwarting democratic progress indefinitely. But South Africa has none 
of the fanatical religious cleavages found in the Middle East. Although 
apartheid has ravaged blacks, this very deprivation will make their sharing in 
the country's prosperity more dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
The most overworked words in any conflict are "something must be done." They 
are heard incessantly in South Africa. But until a democratic constitution is 
forged and free elections are held -- even amid some violence -- it is 
difficult to see an end to this conflict. The violence should be a spur to 
clinch democracy.

PERESTROIKA FOR SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. WYCOFF is president and chief executive officer of Atlantic 
Richfield Co. in Los Angeles and vice chairman of the Business Roundtable for 
Education. He believes that business must help make the necessary changes in 
the school system. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The schools have to be fundamentally restructured. We have to change the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The role of business is the role of the rest of the community, that is to get 
in and help to make the necessary changes. 
</P>
<P>
We have some management (skills) and we have the resources to (further) this 
process in an effective way. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key elements of restructuring is to realize that the centralized 
management that we have today (isn't working). (Give) local schools more power. 
It would help a lot. 
</P>
<P>
It's kind of an extreme example, but you can liken it in some way to the 
Eastern European economies, which were highly centralized. Everything was 
controlled from the top. I think that they found that that economic system just 
doesn't work. A (decentralized) democratic sort of system is just much more 
efficient. I think that the same sort of perestroika for our school systems 
would be very effective.

OUTTAKES: NO LAUGHING MATTER

<P>
Is Ed O'Neill married . . . with an image problem? 
</P>
<P>
Known for his role as beleaguered hubby/father Al Bundy on Fox Broadcasting's 
"Married . . . With Children," O'Neill -- a dramatic actor prior to the series 
-- recently got laughed right out of Paramount's Vietnam action-adventure, 
"Flight of the Intruder." 
</P>
<P>
Because test screening audiences laughed when a serious O'Neill appeared as the 
prosecutor in a military trial, O'Neill's scene has been snipped. The role has 
been recast with actor Fred Dalton Thompson, according to a source close to the 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel good about what happened," says O'Neill. "As an actor, it's kind 
of frightening. It shows what TV can do to you. At the same time, I can't 
complain about what the series has given me. It's a double-edged sword. 
</P>
<P>
"What I don't want is for these producers in town to think they can't use me in 
serious films -- especially since all I did before this ("Married") was 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
A longtime friend of director John Milius, O'Neill did two days work on the 
film -- which was to be unbilled. 
</P>
<P>
"My scene comes an hour or so into the picture. There's no introduction to my 
character -- I come from out of nowhere. Suddenly there I am, in a uniform, 
walking around this table at a court martial. I think that, to audiences who 
aren't expecting me, it's as if Al Bundy's suddenly appeared. It's like Al 
Bundy Joins the Army." 
</P>
<P>
If anyone wants to see O'Neill, the dramatic actor, they can watch the ABC-TV 
movie "The Whereabouts of Jenny," to air this fall. O'Neill portrays a father 
separated from his daughter by a witness relocation program. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole film is serious," promises O'Neill. "There's nothing to laugh at."

STAGE WEEK: 'ICE CREAM' GETS SCORE WITH NEW FLAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sci-fi master Ray Bradbury ventures into the other-worldly regions of musical 
theater in his 16-character romantic comedy, "The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit" 
(with book by Bradbury, music by Jose Feliciano, lyrics by Feliciano and his 
wife, Susan), opening today at the Pasadena Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The play itself is not new goods. Bradbury adapted his story for the stage over 
two decades ago -- with musical accompaniment that included such popular fare 
as "La Cucaracha" and the habanera. Then a year ago, original cast member Henry 
Darrow suggested that Bradbury enlist Feliciano to write some original tunes. 
The result is a 12-song score, what Bradbury describes as "every kind of 
Hispanic style -- all the Mexican music you can think of in the last 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
The author sees the music as an organic addition. "I learned my lessons from 
Emily Dickinson and William Shakespeare: When you write (in) metaphor, you're 
writing poetry; you're writing music. I write for the musical stage without 
knowing I'm doing it." Two other Bradbury works have already made the 
transition to musicals: "Dandelion Wine" and "Fahrenheit 451," an "aria about 
book-burning" which made its bow last year in Fort Wayne, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
The story of "Ice Cream Suit" was born during Bradbury's leaner days, when, 
from 1941-45, he lived downtown in a one-bedroom apartment on the corner of 
Temple and Figueroa. Such is the dwelling for the play's suit-owners, a quintet 
of Latino men who take turns donning the magical garment -- and the good vibes 
it engenders. "Wearing it changes their lives," Bradbury explained. "As they 
share it, their friendship grows . . . till the suit owns them and they become 
one." 
</P>
<P>
The author himself claims to enjoy such creative partnering. "I'm a good 
collaborator," he said unequivocally. "I enjoy that process." Nor does he 
resist editing -- even at this late date. "We had a preview last night, and at 
the end of it, I said to the director (Charles Rome Smith), 'There are six 
lines in Act 1, Scene 1, I think we can cut.' You must be able to do that, or 
you're no good. It comes down to two things: You have to know how to write, and 
you have to know how to cut without hurting it." 
</P>
<P>
JEROME ROBBINS' ALUMNI: The producers of "Jerome Robbins' Broadway," opening 
Oct. 10 at the Shubert, are looking for anyone who has appeared in the original 
run of any of the shows featured in the dance musical or other Broadway shows 
that Robbins directed or choreographed. If you qualify, call (213) 655-0103 to 
reserve a free pair of tickets to opening night and the subsequent reception. 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BITS: It's an eclectic bit of goods upcoming this month at Highways 
Performance Space in Santa Monica. Following this week's multimedia program, 
"Incest: A Celebration of Recovery," comes Susan Franklin Tanner's 
autobiographically-inspired "Journey to Singapore: The Infertility Play" (Sept. 
27-29) and the Emma Goldman Gypsy Players' take on modern gay life in "Radical 
Faeries" (Sept. 30). 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kearns, who recently wrapped his staging of "AIDS/US II," gets even 
busier than usual next month with the Oct. 6 opening of his and Darien Martus' 
"Homeless" (billed as a "street opera") at Theatre/Theater, followed closely by 
"more intimacies" at LATC's Theatre 4 on Oct. 9. Kearns will alternate 
performances of the original "intimacies" (a gallery of AIDS characters) with 
the follow-up show and six new characters.

This recordings goes astray in virtually every department. Solti's affinity for 
this brooding tragedy of revenge and statecraft sounds minimal. 
</P>
<P>
He under-characterizes Verdi's atmospheric orchestral writing and substitutes 
aggressive attacks for genuine pulse and grandeur. Te Kanawa seems bent on 
cultivating luscious soprano tone -- which she does exceptionally well -- 
rather than creating an Amelia of idiomatic urgency. Nucci's baritone misses 
the weight for the dramatic climaxes that make the eponymous doge one of 
Verdi's most complex creations. As Fiesco, Burchuladze's approximate low notes, 
spread tone and mushy Italian belie the Russian basso's international 
reputation. Aragall's once-vibrant tenor is now frayed and plagued with 
intonation problems. The finest singing comes from Paolo Coni's Paolo. ALLAN

MAAZEL'S NEW 'AIDA,' MONTEUX'S VINTAGE 'MANON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By WALTER PRICE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VERDI: "Aida." Maria Chiara, Luciano Pavarotti, Ghena Dimitrova, Leo Nucci, 
Paata Burchuladze, others; forces of Teatro alla Scala, Milan; Lorin Maazel 
conducting. London 417 439-2 (three compact discs). 
</P>
<P>
 VERDI: "Aida." Juliya Viner-Chenisheva, Alexandrina Milcheva, Nikolai 
Smochevski, Nicola Ghiuselev, others; forces of Sofia Opera; Ivan Marinov 
conducting. AVZ(2) 3017 (two compact discs). 
</P>
<P>
 London's new recording is an example of the difficulties in properly casting 
standard Italian repertory these days. Chiara has all the right instincts for a 
good Aida; unfortunately, the voice has little personality or impact. 
Distressingly, there are also signs of unsteadiness. Pavarotti manages some 
suave singing in the Nile duet and the Tomb Scene, but he is hard-pressed in 
the dramatic outbursts and virtually blasts an extended B-flat at the close of 
"Celeste Aida" (which sounds as if some dials are being twirled to suggest a 
diminuendo). 
</P>
<P>
Nucci is his usual monochromatic self as Amonasro and Burchuladze's bass is 
craggy. Dimitrova, a dramatic soprano rather than the prescribed mezzo, 
delivers the outstanding singing in the set as an Amneris with a weighty voice 
secure throughout the range and with just the right dramatic punch. Such a 
disciplined conductor as Maazel gives us, obviously, what he wants us to hear, 
but his interpretation varies between very fast and annoyingly ponderous. 
</P>
<P>
If the Seiji Ozawa/Jessye Norman "Carmen" was the party record of last year, 
the budget-line "Aida" from Bulgaria is a prime candidate for 1990. Milcheva's 
Amneris is serviceable (she has the top notes), but Viner-Chenisheva sounds as 
if the recording just might, or ought to be, her farewell performance. Nikolov, 
who sang two Met performances 30 years ago, bleats his way through Radames' 
music, wielding his voice like a machete in a sugar-cane field. Ghiuselev's 
Ramfis is decent enough. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the singers have that Slavic back-of-the-throat production, which means 
almost all open vowels are swallowed. Some of the Italian pronunciation verges 
on the comical. Marinov and his crew must be using scores with the majority of 
dynamic markings erased. Still, they certainly are all enthusiastic. No cue 
numbers for individual arias or ensembles, and no libretto. Positive point: the 
set requires two CDs, while London's takes three. WALTER PRICE

MASSENET: "Manon." Victoria de los Angeles, Henri Legay, Michel Dens, Jean 
Borthayre; forces of Opera-Comique; Pierre Monteux, conducting. EMI 7 63549 2 
(three compact discs).

<P>
 MASSENET: "Manon" (in Italian). Mirella Freni, Luciano Pavarotti, Rolando 
Panerai, Antonio Zerbini, forces of La Scala; Peter Maag, conducting. MEL 27046 
(two compact discs). 
</P>
<P>
 The reissue of the classic De los Angeles "Manon" on CD, lovingly conducted by 
Monteux, is especially welcome. In 1955 the soprano's voice was in its 
refulgent prime, warm and voluptuous in its middle and lower ranges, secure 
enough at the top to manage a D-flat with little effort. The haunting color 
changes she was able to ring in such set pieces as "Voyons, Manon" and "Adieu, 
notre petite table," remind us how much the Met lost when she left in 1961. Her 
French, though gently accented, coexists comfortably with that of her genuinely 
Gallic colleagues. Legay is an elegant if somewhat wispy Des Grieux, Dens a 
stylish Lescaut and Borthayre a sumptuous Comte. The ensemble work coaxed from 
all participants by Monteux, then 89, is exemplary. A dividend on the final CD 
is Chausson's "Poeme de l'Amour et de la Mer," luxuriantly recorded by De los 
Angeles in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
A striking contrast and worthy curio is the 1969 broadcast from Scala in 
Italian. It may not be exactly Massenet's masterpiece, but it shows strong 
evidence of two of the loveliest lyric voices around at the time, Freni and 
Pavarotti, before they began taking on heavier parts, losing some of their 
freshness and flexibility in the process. Both were singers of gratifying 
sensitivity, especially Freni in "Addio, o nostro picciol desco" and Pavarotti 
in the Dream Aria, but they pull out all the Italianate stops in a thrilling 
Saint-Sulpice duet. The Cours-la-Reine is cut, but Manon's Gavotte is inserted 
in the gambling scene. 
</P>
<P>
Panerai is a smooth, cynical Lescaut. Maag often can't resist Pucciniesque 
climaxes, but otherwise gives excellent support. Walter Price

RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 WARRANT "CHERRY PIE" COLUMBIA: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE 
OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).

Much of Warrant's success is due to its clever pandering to the sexism rampant 
among young metalmaniacs. On its second album, which features mostly 
high-powered rockers, Warrant is at its macho best with the Queen-influenced 
"Cherry Pie," a raunchy ode to a sexpot, and "Love in Stereo," which celebrates 
having sex with two women simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a strange twist to this album, and by pop-metal's rather low 
standards it's fairly impressive: Warrant's women-as-sex-objects stance doesn't 
pervade the entire album. On several songs -- "Bed of Roses" and the ballads 
"Blind Faith" and "I Saw Red" -- women are actually regarded as human beings. 
Warrant had better watch it. Hearing those unusually tender (for this genre) 
ballads, some metal fans might think the band has gone soft. Showing too much 
sensitivity toward women's feelings is a quick way to kill off a budding 
pop-metal career. 
</P>
<P>
By far the best of these songs -- most of them written by lead singer Jani Lane 
-- is "Uncle Tom's Cabin," a taut, hard-rocking tale of murder. At the other 
end of the quality spectrum is the childish stream of spoken obscenities called 
"Ode to Tipper Gore." Warrant could have devised a more intelligent way to 
protest censorship. DENNIS HUNT

DEADHEAD SCHED: Arista Records has put together a limited-edition CD package 
for the Grateful Dead's upcoming live double album, "Without a Net," which will 
include a picture CD and a special Dead poster. But the real news is that 
producer (and Dead fan) Ralph Sall, who did the recent "Guilty Pleasures" 
compilation, is putting together a collection of Dead cover songs. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which is still untitled, so far features a lineup of Elvis 
Costello (doing "Ship of Fools"), Dr. John ("Deal"), Los Lobos ("Bertha"), 
Bruce Hornsby ("Jackstraw") and Burning Spear ("Estimated Prophet"). A portion 
of the profits from the compilation, due from Arista as early as spring of 
1991, will go to the Rain Forest Action Network and other ecological-oriented 
causes. . . . And this Wednesday and Thursday are Ed Sullivan Days at Rhino 
Records. The always-irreverent store is offering $1 discounts on album 
purchases of any performers (from the Beatles to Jose Jimenez) who were 
featured on "The Ed Sullivan Show."

POP EYE: GETO BOYS' RAUNCHY RAP GETS THE GREEN LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Look out, the Geto Boys are back in business. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial rap group's Def-American Records album, which became a record 
biz cause celebre when Geffen Records refused to release it last month, will 
now be distributed by the WEA Corp. That's right -- the same firm that 
distributes Warner Bros., Elektra and Atlantic Records . . . and Geffen 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
Def-American chief Rick Rubin confirms he has been talking to all three major 
WEA labels about making a deal for the Geto Boys or distributing his entire 
label, which he says he's contractually "free" to take elsewhere since Geffen 
refused to release the Geto Boys album. 
</P>
<P>
As a producer of such hit-makers as LL Cool J, the Beastie Boys, the Cult and 
shock-comic Andrew Dice Clay, Rubin is a highly sought-after industry 
Wunderkind. But the label chiefs wooing Rubin aren't necessarily willing to 
risk signing the Geto Boys unless they also get the rest of Rubin's 
Def-American roster, which includes Clay and heavy-metal hotshots Slayer and 
Danzig. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to get the Geto Boys' self-titled album out while the band is still a 
media draw, Rubin took the shrewd step of going directly to WEA distribution 
chief Henry Droz and making a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Geffen Records has taken the position of not distributing the album, but since 
there is apparently genuine interest in the group from our other labels, WEA is 
accommodating Mr. Rubin," explained Droz, WEA Corp. president, who said the 
album will hit the stores Friday. "It's really a label-to-be-named-later deal. 
Evidently one of our labels will be involved with the group, so we're simply 
distributing the record until a decision is made about who'll be representing 
Rick's label." 
</P>
<P>
Who has the inside track? Rubin isn't saying. In fact, with tempers cooled, he 
refused to rule out the prospect of staying with Geffen (which signed Rubin 
when his previous distributor, CBS Records, refused to release his first Danzig 
album). "I may decide Geffen is the best place to be," he said. "In fact, 
they've expressed an interest in my staying." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rubin doggedly insists that the Geto Boys, who offer both the 
violent imagery of N.W.A. and the graphic sexual raunch of 2 Live Crew, are a 
valid pop phenomenon. "Their record is very entertaining -- I listen to it 
every day," said Rubin, who sees the group as pioneers of a horror-rap genre. 
"They don't use language or ideas that teen-agers haven't heard every day. 
</P>
<P>
"If this record had been made by a white group like the Beastie Boys, it would 
never have caused a sensation. But because the group is made up of young 
blacks, it's viewed as scary." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, what Rubin really finds scary is the record industry's attitude toward 
censorship and artistic expression. "It's a bad time in the music business. 
We're seeing labels cave in after the slightest bit of pressure. Warners made 
Sam Kinison enclose an AIDS education pamphlet in his record. Atlantic rejected 
lyrics from a recent Ratt song. That's wrong -- artists should control the way 
they present their art." 
</P>
<P>
Still, many industry execs -- even die-hard rap supporters like Tommy Boy 
Records chief Monica Lynch -- have blasted the Geto Boys, saying they would 
never promote a record with such violent language and foul, sexually graphic 
attitudes toward women. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unrealistic to interpret these songs as endorsing the hatred of women," 
responded Rubin. "I don't think the group actually hates women any more than I 
think they're going to go out and kill somebody. We're dealing with horror and 
entertainment here. The images in their lyrics, whether it's sleeping with 
seven women or cutting someone up with a chain saw, are exaggerations. It's not 
any more real than a horror movie. These guys are just having fun."

THE NAME GAME: When it came time for Precious Metal to name its new album, the 
all-gal hard-rock band were totally stumped. The group put together a list of 
nearly 30 possible titles -- which Pop Eye obtained the other day. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the marketing wizards at the group's label, Chameleon Records, 
decided to simply call the record Precious Metal (boo!). But consider the 
alternatives. Potential titles included: Hard as Nails, Assault and Flattery, 
Survival of the Loudest, Rub This, Girl's World, Ore, Big Stuff and Put the 
Hammer Down. In addition to a killer cover of Jean Knight's "Mr. Big Stuff," 
the group's new record features guest performances by Heart's Nancy Wilson and 
Cheap Trick's Tom Petersson. . . . The venerable rock club Madame Wong's West 
is undergoing a major face-lift, with a splashy reopening scheduled for 
mid-October. Rechristened West 2900, the club will be aiming for bigger-name 
bands and will have new management and a new look, including a game room with 
billiards and a kitchen serving Italian food. If you can't wait till then, stop 
by Sept. 28, when a new Friday-night club debuts there. Dubbed Route 66 and run 
by a trio of veteran club hands, it will no doubt serve as a Westside haven for 
L.A.'s burgeoning Rubbie (rich urban biker) crowd.

CABLE TIES JEWISH COMMUNITY TOGETHER; 
</P>
<P>
A REVAMP OF JEWISH TELEVISION NETWORK IS AIMED AT ATTRACTING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO 
RECONNECT WITH THEIR COMMUNITY. 
</P>

<P>
Jay Sanderson liked the idea of Jewish Television Network from the moment he 
heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
"The board members told me that they wanted programs to reach out through cable 
television to the Jewish and non-Jewish community with news, information, 
entertainment," said Sanderson, who was recruited by the JTN board last year to 
be executive director of the service. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I thought it was a great idea. Really exciting. I told them, 'This 
should be.' " 
</P>
<P>
But it already was. 
</P>
<P>
JTN had existed, at that point, for eight years. It was even carried by the 
cable television company that served Sanderson's Woodland Hills home. "I had 
never even heard of it before that meeting, even though I was heavily involved 
in the Jewish community. I could see they had a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
This Jewish High Holy Days season marks the first anniversary of Sanderson's 
revamping of JTN's program schedule. Although there are no ratings services 
that measure the audience for cable shows, Sanderson said he has tangible 
evidence that JTN is reaching far more of the Jewish populace. JTN's subscriber 
list has grown, in just one year, from 60 to more than 700. 
</P>
<P>
"Cable is perfect for what we want to do, which is to reach Jewish people who 
may have drifted away from the community," Sanderson said, sitting in one of 
the spare offices that JTN rents in a Melrose Boulevard office building that 
has seen spiffier days. "The Jewish newspapers in this country don't reach 
those people. They are generally just talking to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"With cable we go into 600,000 homes just in the Los Angeles area. We have a 
chance of reaching that young person in the Valley who has maybe intermarried 
or become assimilated and might want to reconnect with the Jewish community. 
They flip through the dial and there we are." 
</P>
<P>
The trick, of course, was getting people to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning," said Sanderson, 33, sitting at his desk in the spare suite 
JTN rents in a Melrose Avenue office building, "JTN had four rabbis sitting 
around and talking about Passover. Or maybe the head of the Jewish Federation 
talking about what was going on in the community. Sometimes they would tape the 
shows right here, in the back office. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not great television." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, JTN was being kept on the air only through emergency 
donations given by a handful of people. "The people who started JTN were doing 
the best they could under the circumstances," Sanderson said. "But there was no 
real understanding of how to build an audience, how to produce something that 
an audience would actually want to see." 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson, who had a background in running nonprofit Jewish ventures, was 
formerly director of the Brandeis Bardin Institute, a Jewish arts and culture 
organization in Simi Valley. And he had some experience in television -- he had 
written commercials and in the mid-1970s he sold a script for the "Family" 
dramatic series that ran on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
"I came on and we started from scratch, raising money and changing the 
programming." The budget, raised mostly by board members, went from less than 
$200,000 in 1988 to its present level of almost $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted people who came upon our programming to see very little difference 
between us and what they might see on a commercial network," he said, "and of 
course, getting good production values cost money." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the need for a higher budget was the fact that at the same time 
Sanderson was making changes, some cable outlets stopped showing JTN for free. 
</P>
<P>
"When JTN began, getting free time was easy because cable television was still 
very young," Sanderson said. "They needed a product to show." JTN shows were 
then on the cable systems' public access channels, which are free to anyone who 
wants to produce a television show. But the competition for public access time 
grew. 
</P>
<P>
"They have great programming, some of the best for cable in the country, and it 
has greatly improved over the last year," said Bill Rosendahl, president of 
Century Cable, which brings JTN into about 150,000 residences in the Los 
Angeles area. "I enjoy it and I'm not even Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
"But it got to the point where we could no longer guarantee them the prime-time 
time slots that they wanted and were used to having. Also, they were 
advertising during their shows for subscriptions, and normally we don't allow 
anything having to do with advertising on public access." 
</P>
<P>
To stay on Century, JTN had to switch from public access status to leased 
access. Neither Sanderson nor Rosendahl would disclose how much the network 
pays for its 10 hours a week, but Rosendahl said leased access on Century can 
run as high as $600 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
JTN is also on leased access on United Cable. But it gets free public access 
time on Cablevision, United Cable and Continental Cable. Later this month, its 
programs go on the public access channels on both cable systems serving San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider JTN a cultural program, so we give the time to them for free," 
said Bruce Arditte, a spokesman for Continental. Although JTN does not have to 
pay to have its programs on Continental, unlike other public access programs, 
it does pay to tape its shows at Continental's Hollywood studio. "They wanted 
higher production values than what we could offer a public access show," 
Arditte said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our own sets built and paid the staff ourselves so that we could take 
the time to give the shows the quality we want," Sanderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The most complex weekly show they do is JTN News, hosted by former Cable News 
Network correspondent Dan Hackel. Each broadcast includes taped reports, with 
recent topics ranging from anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe to protests by some 
Jewish groups against what they feel are negative Jewish stereotypes in the 
Spike Lee film, "Mo' Better Blues." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, there were also, as there are in most editions of JTN News, 
news reports from Israel and other parts of the Middle East. The reports often 
include statements from Israeli government officials. A recent story featured 
several of them expressing the view that the Iraqi-Kuwait crisis proves that 
the Palestinian situation, a highly sensitive one for Israel, is not the 
primary source of tension in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sanderson said he does not think of JTN as a mouthpiece for the 
Israeli government line, he does say the newscast strives to balance news 
reports on the major broadcast networks that he feels occasionally portray 
Israel in a bad light. 
</P>
<P>
"If a network does a report on the Palestinian situation, they will start, more 
often than not, by showing small children throwing rocks at soldiers," he said. 
"It makes for good pictures, but it builds the stereotype of the downtrodden 
Palestinian and the oppressive Israeli." 
</P>
<P>
JTN counters, he said, with reports on how vulnerable Israelis feel to 
Palestinian terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Other weekly shows on JTN include an interview show hosted by Diane Glazer, on 
which such figures as Henry Kissinger, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Yitzhak Shamir 
have appeared, and a celebrity talk show with Robert Clary, best known for 
playing the part of Louis LeBeau on the "Hogan's Heroes" TV series that aired 
on CBS from 1965 to 1971., 
</P>
<P>
Probably the best-known program on JTN is "Judy's Kitchen," hosted by Judy 
Zeidler, author of "The Kosher Gourmet" cookbook. The program has been on JTN 
for several years, but it used to feature just Zeidler cooking. Now each week 
there are guest chefs from prominent L.A. restaurants, such as Michel Richard, 
Michael Roberts, Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton, making kosher versions of 
dishes from their restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"When you add those chefs, it makes it sexy television," Sanderson said. "It 
appeals to everyone interested in great food." 
</P>
<P>
Zeidler is able to get those chefs because she and her husband, Marvin, who 
founded the Zeidler &amp; Zeidler clothing chain, are well known on the 
restaurant scene. They are major investors in Citrus and Broadway Deli. 
</P>
<P>
JTN does not, even in its revamped form, seem to have much of an impact on 
local Jewish leaders. None of several local rabbis informally surveyed said 
they watch JTN with any regularity. None could name the title of a single JTN 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sanderson would welcome more recognition for his programs from the 
Jewish hierarchy, he said that one of the biggest priorities for JTN is to 
reach Jews that at present only rarely have contact with a rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, he has high hopes for the JTN show "Twenty 2 Forty," which debuts 
later this month. It's a retooling of "JTN Magazine," a show made up of short 
features recorded on videotape around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The new show will be for people of the age range in the title," Sanderson 
said. "There is nothing just for them, now, in Jewish programming and they are 
very, very important. The show will cover serious matters, like how to find a 
synagogue and how to join one, but it will also be about where to find the best 
corned beef sandwich in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson is clearly excited about the program. His pitch on its behalf is not 
unlike that of any television executive. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be slick, it will be fast-paced. There will be profiles on 
contemporary people, like a Paul Simon or a Randy Newman. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be high concept."

TWO SIDES OF THE GETO-GEFFEN FLAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geffen president Eddie Rosenblatt may find Clay funny. I don't. And who says 
Clay's brand ofhumor (if you can call it that) doesn't encourage racism, 
homophobia, and misogyny? And how about that Guns 'N Roses song "One in a 
Million"(with its racial slurs against blacks)? Pure genius. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same label that released Slayers' "Reign in Blood," which glorifies 
violence. I mean really, with songs like "Angel of Death," "Criminally Insane" 
and "Altar of Sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
There is racism involved, because rap fans are mainly black. What's Geffen

of much needed reality?

I suggest that Noffsinger take a dictionary and look up three words: satire, 
scapegoat, and responsibility.

Cheech and Chong in their earlier films depicted drug use as satire, and if 
anything, showed the potential for disaster while under the influence.

Patrick Goldstein's indignation over the nude model in the Billy Joel ad (Pop 
Eye, Sept. 9) is surpassed only by the writer's illiteracy. Did he really 
write, "But you can't help but wonder -- aren't their (sic) any women in the 
music biz who think its (sic) tacky (and yes, sexist) to use female nudity to 
sell records?" I would suggest Mr. Goldstein take his sensitivity to a local 
junior high and learn some rudiments of English. The Times might like to have 
their proofreaders accompany him.

SPECTER OF ANTI-SEMITISM RISING ONCE AGAIN IN POLAND;

<P>
PREJUDICE: ALTHOUGH THE COUNTRY IS NEARLY BEREFT OF JEWS, THE ANCIENT ISSUE IS 
BEGINNING TO INFILTRATE POLITICS.

<P>
Four months ago, someone painted a small, rusty-red swastika on a stone pillar 
a few steps from the Israeli ambassador's home. 
</P>
<P>
He drives by it every day, neighbors walk dogs past it, children play nearby. 
No one has tried to obliterate the ugly symbol. 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti and other signs of anti-Semitism are being seen again in Poland, even 
though it is nearly bereft of Jews, and the prejudice of the streets has begun 
to infiltrate politics. 
</P>
<P>
Some rightist politicians are fanning nationalist emotions and, with a seeming 
inevitability, anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, prominent anti-Communist figures like Adam Michnik, editor 
of the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, and Zbigniew Bujak -- both leaders of the 
pro-government Democratic Action party -- have been sounding the alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa, indignant at suggestions of bigotry on the 
part of himself or some of his followers, declared, "Lech Walesa is not and 
will not be anti-Semitic." 
</P>
<P>
In a resolution July 29, Walesa's national Citizens Committee condemned both 
prejudice and the use of unfounded charges of anti-Semitism to smear political 
opponents. Members of the committee have accused foreign journalists of 
exaggerating the extent of anti-Semitism in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The late sociologist Aleksander Hertz, a Polish Jew, said anti-Semitism grew in 
the 19th Century in response to Poland's humiliating partitions, Russian 
influences and the prosperity of a burgeoning Jewish population, which both the 
declining aristocracy and impoverished peasants resented. 
</P>
<P>
In politics, anti-Semitism peaked just before World War II, when it was a major 
tenet of the popular National Democrats. University students hounded Jewish 
colleagues and anti-Semites organized boycotts of Jewish businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Three million Polish Jews were killed by the Nazis. Some of the half-million 
who survived owed their lives to Poles who hid them, but others were betrayed 
by Polish acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
Polish Jews who lived through the Holocaust were traumatized by it and feared 
trying to reclaim homes and property from Christians, particularly after a 
pogrom in 1946 that took 48 lives in Kielce. Most of them emigrated to Israel 
or the United States. 
</P>
<P>
An official Communist purge of "Zionists" prompted the last big wave of 
emigration in 1968, reducing the number of Jews to 5,000-15,000 in a nation of 
38 million people. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in centuries, Poland is without a large Jewish population, 
and profound changes have resulted. 
</P>
<P>
Before the war, Jews were about 10% of the population, concentrated in towns 
and cities, and made up a large part of the middle class. The landed 
aristocracy disdained commerce and peasants stuck to their farms, so much of 
the small business, trade and industry were left to Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Half a century after Nazi occupation, Poland still has not come to grips with 
the loss of its Jewish population. Any discussion of Jews is likely to provoke 
strong emotions, often defensive. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's only rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, said he has observed more 
anti-Semitism recently. He used to find respect and friendliness when he walked 
the streets in his traditional Hasidic garb, Joskowicz said, but now encounters 
hostility. 
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks ago, I had guests from Israel, and we went for a walk," he said in 
an interview. "Then youths, maybe 21, maybe younger, started shouting 'Jews to 
Palestine!' and other slogans too. I did not pay any attention, let them shout. 
</P>
<P>
"But when we walked a few meters they approached us and started hitting one of 
the guests." 
</P>
<P>
Joskowicz said he now avoids walking at night and does not know what to tell 
Jews from abroad when they ask him if it is safe to visit Poland. 
</P>
<P>
There is a tendency to blame Jews for the nation's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep hearing that a gang has gotten to the feeding trough, they are probably 
Jews and they are destroying us," Walesa told a meeting of his national 
Citizens Committee on June 24. 
</P>
<P>
He said such remarks do not mean anti-Semitism is increasing, but that the 
government must do a better job of explaining itself to the people. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers who occupied the Agriculture Ministry in June, demanding guaranteed 
prices, were heard muttering about the "Jewish government." 
</P>
<P>
That government is led by a devout Roman Catholic, Prime Minister Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki, who identifies with Christian-Democratic politics and sometimes is 
accused of being too solicitous of the church. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations that Jews run the government rest on the fact that some prominent 
Solidarity politicians are Jews. Two examples are Michnik and Parliament member 
Bronislaw Geremek, leader of the Citizens Parliamentary Club, who are of Jewish 
descent but do not practice the religion. 
</P>
<P>
Communist functionaries used such information in the past in the vain hope of 
discrediting Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the National Party, a far-right group based in the southern city of 
Krakow, said it was unfair for an ethnic minority to have dominance in the 
government. The Grunwald Society, created by nationalistic Communists, 
contended recently that "German and Jewish chauvinists" were the greatest 
threats to Polish sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska, who wrote a book on the 
remaining Jews in Poland with her husband, a photographer, said anti-Semitism 
is coming to the surface in the more liberal atmosphere since Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
"Now everything is free," she said. "Many good things have come out, but also 
some bad things."

ROYAL AIR FORCE BESTED HITLER'S BEST IN WW II'S HEROIC BATTLE OF BRITAIN; 
</P>
<P>
IN SEPTEMBER, 1940, GERMANY LAID SIEGE TO LONDON. AT THE TIME, JOSEPH W. GRIGG 
WAS A CORRESPONDENT FOR UNITED PRESS IN BERLIN.

<TEXT>
<P>
On Sept. 14, 1940, a hot, brilliantly sunny Sunday, Adolf Hitler's 
Nazi-controlled Berlin radio launched an all-out propaganda campaign to 
announce to the world the climax of what later became known as the Battle of 
Britain and the start of the German Luftwaffe's bombing blitz against London. 
</P>
<P>
Along with other foreign correspondents in Berlin, I was summoned to a special 
Sunday afternoon news conference at the Nazi Propaganda Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Raucous trumpet fanfare, special Nazi government communiques and purported 
eyewitness stories by breathless Nazi radio reporters -- this was long before 
the days of television -- and a new battle tune titled "Bombs on England" kept 
the German radio running at white heat throughout that late summer Sunday and 
the next week. 
</P>
<P>
With the defeat and surrender of France in June, 1940, Britain had been left 
alone to face the might of Hitler's victorious Wermacht and a Luftwaffe that 
was at that time the world's most formidable air force. 
</P>
<P>
Over the English Channel and the green fields of southeast England, young, 
largely inexperienced and heavily outnumbered British Royal Air Force fighter 
pilots plunged in their Spitfires and Hurricanes into battle with the 
Luftwaffe's crack Messerschmidt 109 and 110 squadrons. 
</P>
<P>
Nazi bombers blasted Britain's fighter airfields at Manston, Biggin Hill and 
elsewhere in southeast England in a bid to smash the Royal Air Force's fighter 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Hitler's strategy, as expanded at the time to American and other neutral 
reporters in Berlin by Nazi officials, depended first on defeating the small, 
greatly outnumbered RAF. 
</P>
<P>
His goal was nothing less than the invasion and defeat of Britain and its 
elimination from the war. By September, 1940, Hitler already had given orders 
to his commanders to prepare for what was to be know as "Operation Sealion," 
the code name for a planned invasion of England. 
</P>
<P>
But Britain's powerful Royal Navy still controlled the English Channel. Nazi 
officials with whom I talked argued that if the RAF were first driven from the 
skies, a German invasion armada could cross the Channel under what was 
described as an "umbrella" of Nazi bombers and fighter planes, against which, 
it was claimed, Britain's Royal Navy would be powerless to block the planned 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Before this, Hitler's master plan called for a general softening up of British 
government and civilian morale by means of devastating air raids on London and 
other big British cities by the concentrated might of the Luftwaffe. 
</P>
<P>
So convinced were the Nazis that this strategy would succeed that officials in 
Berlin boasted that within weeks they would be holding news conferences in 
Buckingham Palace, home of Britain's royal family. 
</P>
<P>
Three German reporters of my acquaintance bet me 25 bottles of Champagne that 
by July 1, 1941, London and the rest of the British Isles would be under Nazi 
occupation. I never collected on that bet because, by the target date in 1941, 
Champagne was practically unobtainable in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
For the coming Battle of Britain, Hitler named one of his top aides, 
Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering, to be Luftwaffe supreme commander. 
</P>
<P>
Goering concentrated all his available air strength of 3,000 planes in occupied 
northern France. He set up his own headquarters on the French channel coast 
from which in clear weather he could stare across the 20 miles to the white 
chalk cliffs of Dover. 
</P>
<P>
In the last days of August and early September, Goering unleashed his bomber 
fleets to attack British coastal shipping and ports and to pound key RAF 
fighter bases in southeastern England. His aim was to drive the RAF back into 
the interior of the country. 
</P>
<P>
But the British managed to make their fighter bases usable again much faster 
than the Nazis had expected. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing air battles the RAF's Spitfires and Hurricanes suffered grievous 
losses. Between Aug. 24 and Sept. 6, according to British figures, Britain lost 
nearly one-fourth of its 1,000 fighter pilots. 
</P>
<P>
But the RAF still survived as an effective fighting force. 
</P>
<P>
As Winston Churchill declared later in a historic speech to the British House 
of Commons, "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many 
to so few." 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 14 and 15 are commemorated in Britain. On those two days the Luftwaffe 
launched its greatest concentrated onslaught yet in daylight attacks against 
London. But postwar information has shown that Luftwaffe losses on those days 
alone were 56 fighters and bombers. British losses were about half that number. 
</P>
<P>
British leaders had estimated that in order to survive, the RAF needed to down 
three Luftwaffe planes to every one RAF plane lost. 
</P>
<P>
Despite grim RAF losses, the result of the Battle of Britain was a defeat for 
the Luftwaffe. All told, in three months in 1940 the Luftwaffe lost nearly 
2,000 planes. Hitler had to abandon forever his plan to invade England. 
</P>
<P>
British civilian morale remained high despite 20,000 casualties and long nights 
spent in bomb shelters and London subway tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
An angry Goering returned from northern France to Berlin after delivering a 
tongue-lashing to his Luftwaffe pilots with these words, "You have not only 
deeply disappointed me, you have betrayed me." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly four years after the defeat of Hitler's plan to invade Britain, U.S., 
British and Canadian forces crossed the English Channel to Nazi-occupied Europe 
on D-Day, June 6, 1944, the forerunner of Allied World War II victory in 
Europe.

SCOUTING MOVEMENT ENJOYS REBIRTH IN EASTERN EUROPE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Looking a little like an overgrown schoolboy, pensioner Vaclav Brichacek was 
close to tears. 
</P>
<P>
Excusing his prewar scouting uniform, he told delegates from 110 countries 
gathered in Paris for the 32nd World Scouting Conference: "I never thought I'd 
wear it again." 
</P>
<P>
Boy Scouts are busy pitching their tents all over a part of the world that has 
been out of bounds for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
They may seem out of date to Western teen-agers, but to youngsters in 
reform-minded Eastern Europe, Lord Robert Baden-Powell's movement is a symbol 
of their new-found freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
Brichacek was visibly moved as he accepted the re-integration of Czechoslovak 
scouts into the 16-million strong world scouting fraternity this summer. The 
recently legalized Scouting Assn. of Hungary was also welcomed back into the 
fold. 
</P>
<P>
After almost 20 years of declining membership in the West, the tens of 
thousands of Eastern European youngsters rushing to join up see the scouting 
movement as a benefit of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
World Scouting Organization spokesman Mark Clayton said: "There's scouting in 
Poland now, and we've had reports of scouting in the Balkans, Bulgaria and even 
Byelorussia." 
</P>
<P>
Even Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, thanking the scouts for a recent 
operation bringing children from Chernobyl, scene of a nuclear reactor disaster 
in 1986, on vacation to the West, described the movement's goals as "noble and 
humanistic." 
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the opportunity for Soviet children to get to know it, creating 
speculation that even Soviet children may soon be tying knots and singing round 
the campfire in the traditional uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"This marks quite a significant change," said Jacques Moreillon, present 
general secretary of the World Scouting Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to now, scouting has been considered a bourgeois movement, preventing youth 
from seeing the true light of communism. It's been attacked and criticized by 
almost every official publication" in Eastern Europe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Voluntary scouting was replaced in many Eastern European countries by 
compulsory Communist youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak Jiri Nirldk, who said he spent 11 years in a concentration camp 
for his commitment to scouting, sees an important role for his 70,000 new 
scouts, in "education after communism." 
</P>
<P>
But he is nervous of overreaction: "We are afraid of televisions and cars. We 
have to show kids that property is not the most important thing in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to show them that it's better to do a thing badly yourself -- singing, 
dancing or whatever -- than to watch the greatest singer in the world do it on 
the television," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo Surjan, one of 16 ex-Boy Scouts who secretly re-started Hungarian 
scouting in a Budapest coffee shop 18 months ago, said Eastern Europe needs "a 
new generation of young people who understand the ideas of honesty, country, 
God." 
</P>
<P>
Scouting was introduced on Brownsea Island in southern England in 1907 by 
Baden-Powell, who hoped to help build a better future by training the adults of 
the future. Several U.S. Presidents are among its Western alumni. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the ideals of duty to self, duty to others and duty to God, scouting 
went underground with the Communists, who gave themselves clandestine names 
like "Nature Lovers of Budapest" or the "Touristic Organization," in 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Brichacek proudly shows a photograph of a 12-year-old boy at a scout camp -- 
Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's best-known dissident who became president after 
the Communist authorities were ousted last year. 
</P>
<P>
Scout leaders say the battle is not yet over. Alexandru Maldiny, who represents 
the 150 Romanian scouts, said he could only admit members who came with a 
recommendation. "Otherwise, you don't know who you're dealing with."

HEART SURGERY OFFERED AT DISCOUNT RATES;

Heart surgeon Denton A. Cooley is best known for the world's first successful 
artificial heart implant and the first successful heart transplant performed in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He also has charted new medical business territory, with packaged pricing at 
discount rates for heart operations and cardiovascular treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Others are following his example. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Heart Institute, a research organization Cooley founded in 1962 and 
the base of his heart surgery team of six, signed its first contract with 
Tenneco, a Houston oil company, six years ago. It has since negotiated 22 
contracts with corporations and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley said his version of discount heart surgery has been inspired mostly by a 
desire to offer quality care at affordable fees. 
</P>
<P>
"The medical directors of corporations and insurance companies need help 
evaluating the care people are receiving," Cooley said. "I wanted to give them 
a package at a reasonable cost. I wanted to help eliminate abuse from the 
health care system." 
</P>
<P>
Such deals also help Cooley and others who contract out, partly because they 
keep their operating rooms full. 
</P>
<P>
"If you do a high volume of heart surgery, you can do it less expensively, and 
you can do it better," said Jeff Goldsmith, a national adviser on medical care 
to the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young. 
</P>
<P>
Packaged pricing is competitive with the growing number of hospitals offering 
complicated procedures such as organ transplants. For employers, the motivation 
for choosing recognized leaders is the old idea that "practice makes perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., known for its diagnostic capabilities, 
sold its first package deal for organ transplants to the Mutual of Omaha 
insurance company.

SOME FLOWER SPECIES MAY SOON BE PUSHING UP DAISIES

Endangered species pop up in the strangest places. Like flower beds. 
</P>
<P>
Plant-protection activists say some species of bulbs bought to decorate 
American and European gardens are being collected by the millions in the wild, 
threatening to wipe out those flowers in their home turf. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most endangered is the cyclamen, which is actually a tuber. Potted 
cyclamen available in flower shops are commercially grown from seeds, but the 
tubers available by mail often have been uprooted from their natural 
environment. Conservationists say more than half the cyclamen tubers exported 
from the Netherlands last year were from the wild. 
</P>
<P>
"Wild-collected flowers are a small percentage of the trade but a large 
percentage of certain kinds of plants," said Faith Campbell, director of the 
plant conservation program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental group. Conservationists urge American gardeners to buy only 
commercially propagated plants. 
</P>
<P>
Working with the World Wildlife Fund and the Garden Club of America, the 
resources council has produced leaflets calling on gardeners to avoid buying 
bulbs of most kinds of cyclamen, sternbergia and galanthus, or snowdrops, which 
they say are collected in the wild in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Those three species are listed as endangered in the Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES. But this treaty 
-- effective in fighting trade in some endangered animal skins, horns and tusks 
-- has had little effect on the flower trade, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Snowdrops are greatly depleted in Turkey's Mediterranean regions, forcing 
traders to seek sources in more remote regions. 
</P>
<P>
The popular "Angel's Tears" narcissus are being collected in the wild, but 
experts are not sure if the source is Portugal or somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Other wildflowers, such as trillium, are being collected from the wild in the 
United States and Canada. Japan, China, India and the Soviet Union appear to be 
the sources for still other rare flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Some species of these plants may be produced by growers in the United States or 
Europe, but buyers are being counseled to check the origins as carefully as 
they can. 
</P>
<P>
This may become easier as a result of the decision last May by the Dutch 
Commodity Board for Ornamental Horticultural Products to require exporters to 
use a "Bulbs from Wild Sources" label to identify wild-collected plants. 
</P>
<P>
Under the negotiated agreement, Dutch exporters will also label their 
cultivated bulbs, beginning in 1992 for minor species and in 1995 for such 
major bulb varieties as tulips and hyacinths. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Netherlands has long dominated the world flower trade, the action 
by the Dutch regulatory body should have a major impact, Campbell said. It is 
not binding, though, on dealers in the United States or other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the agreement was reached too late for most of this fall's catalogues. 
So, even if American gardeners order from Dutch dealers covered by the rules, 
they might not know they were buying wild-collected flowers until the bulbs 
arrive in the mail, labeled "wild sources." 
</P>
<P>
"We can just hope they won't order those again," Campbell said. "It is a messy 
phasing-in." 
</P>
<P>
The long-range solution, she said, could be in helping people in Turkey and 
elsewhere who make money from collecting wild flowers to start propagating the 
rare flowers in or near the native habitat, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gardeners should not think they are aiding nature by keeping alive a species 
that might be disappearing in its native habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't consider that a contribution to conservation in any way," Campbell 
said. "It's not playing its role in the ecosystem in which it evolved."

NORAD TUNES IN TO DRUG WAR; 
</P>
<P>
SMUGGLERS: THE AIR FORCE IS SHIFTING MORE RESOURCES TOWARD THE COCAINE BATTLE. 
A COMMANDER SAYS THIS HAS BOOSTED MORALE AND SHARPENED SKILLS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Relaxed relations with the Soviet Union have allowed the North American 
Aerospace Defense Command to shift more of its resources to another threat: 
South American drug smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
But NORAD's commander, Gen. Donald J. Kutyna, believes that every time the 
United States ups the ante, the cocaine cartel will counter with money and 
stealth. 
</P>
<P>
"The way you're going to stop the drug war is at the user level, you're not 
going to stop it at the interdiction level," said Kutyna, a four-star general 
and Vietnam veteran who assumed command of NORAD in April. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember the Ho Chi Minh trail? Well, we bombed them (the North Vietnamese), 
we napalmed them, everything else in the whole world. We still couldn't stop 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"The druggie is always going to find an innovative way to get in. We're going 
to make it tougher for them, we're going to make it more costly, we're going to 
deter some by putting them in jail. But the price of that stuff is high enough 
that they're (smugglers) going to keep trying." 
</P>
<P>
NORAD is a joint United States-Canadian command headquartered at Peterson Air 
Force Base and inside the top-secret Cheyenne Mountain global eavesdropping 
complex, both at Colorado Springs. Their listening posts span the globe and 
extend into space. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Kutyna said that involving his troops in the drug war 
has boosted morale and sharpened skills. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us a lot of good practice that we weren't getting before," Kutyna 
said. "Before, we had to hire Lear jets or T-33s to fly as enemy intruder 
targets. Now we've got real targets out there who are really trying to evade us 
as if their life depends on it, they're a lot more motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"So our crews are scrambling at them, several scrambles a day . . . something 
like 51 actual intercepts this year. It's keeping (our crews) sharper. Sitting 
at alert for hour after hour, day after day, is kind of dull," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very good for morale. I think probably my highest morale troops are the 
guys involved with drug interdiction, from the intelligence segment to the 
pilots flying intercepts to the guys working in radar, because we're really 
doing something worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
Among its assets in the drug war, NORAD has 41 ground radar sites in the 
continental United States and 13 in Alaska; tethered Aerostats (radar balloons) 
in Florida and the Southwest; about 60 fighter planes at 30 alert locations, 
and a fleet of E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) planes. 
</P>
<P>
Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, 42% of the Air Force's AWACS missions were flown 
against potential drug smugglers. Nearly three weeks after the invasion, a 
NORAD spokesman said that percentage was still "about the same." 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very costly way of chasing druggies," said Kutyna, who favors a 
broader, ground-based overlapping radar net -- the experimental 
Over-the-Horizon Backscatter Radar system. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't get Congress to fund it. I don't know if it's politics, or just a 
matter of money, but they have declared that the drug war is over, we don't 
have to worry about it anymore and therefore we don't need it." 
</P>
<P>
Kutyna said drug smugglers have switched their main route into the United 
States from the Caribbean to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixty to 70% of the drug traffic now coming into the States is through 
Mexico," Kutyna said. "At first they used to fly right up through Mexico and 
across our border. We've precluded that with AWACS patrols there, we've got 
radar on balloons. So we've kind of shut down the border, much better than it 
was before, though they can still sneak through every once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 National Defense Authorization Act assigned the Defense Department as 
the front-line agency in the fight against the drug barons. Initially, the 
Pentagon resisted involvement in the domestic "war," but as the Cold War wound 
down, the military increasingly warmed to the new battle front. 
</P>
<P>
This fiscal year the Defense Department will spend an estimated $450 million 
against drug smugglers; next year, $1.2 billion is budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they have their work cut out for them. Military experts estimate that 
about 220,000 tons of cocoa leaves are grown in Andean rain forests every year, 
and that between 3,000 and 5,000 sea trips and up to 3,500 aircraft flights 
annually bring cocaine to as many as 3 million American users. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law prohibits the military from arresting smugglers or firing upon 
them; the NORAD crews can intercept planes and force them to turn back, or 
track them until they land and tip off other law enforcement agencies as to 
their whereabouts.

VIRAL EPIDEMIC SUSPECTED IN DOLPHIN DEATHS OFF SPAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dead dolphins are washing up on Spain's eastern Mediterranean coast in 
unusually high numbers, causing marine biologists and ecologists to suspect a 
viral epidemic is killing them. 
</P>
<P>
Many scientists and environmental activists believe the deaths are the 
inevitable outcome of large-scale dumping of toxic pollutants in the 
Mediterranean by petrochemical plants. 
</P>
<P>
Esteve Grau, a University of Barcelona biologist, said preliminary results of 
autopsies on three of the dead mammals showed extremely high levels of 
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on the hypothesis that the dolphins ate PCB-contaminated fish 
and that this severely weakened their immune systems, making them susceptible 
to a still-unidentified virus," Grau said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
PCBs are liquid, resinous or crystalline organic compounds used in industrial 
processes as lubricants, heat-transfer fluids or to give strength or 
flexibility to wood, metal or concrete. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the scientists' hypothesis to be correct," said Xavier Pastor, head 
of the Greenpeace environmental group's office in Palma, capital of the Spanish 
island of Majorca in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
He said the toxicity of PCBs and their resistance to decomposition make them 
especially dangerous to mammals. 
</P>
<P>
"The epidemic appears similar to others that killed up to 800 seals in the 
North Sea off the Netherlands in 1988 and in another case under study in 
California," Pastor said. 
</P>
<P>
He said some of the dead dolphins had been found on beaches near Palma, in the 
Balearic archipelago 150 miles south of Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Grau and other scientists from the Barcelona Zoo, the Marineland Aquatic Park 
and the University of Valencia have conducted 10 autopsies on dolphins. They 
are trying to determine why only striped dolphin, and not fish, have been 
killed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquim Piza of Marineland said doubts remain about whether PCBs caused the 
dolphins to die. 
</P>
<P>
"If that were the case, it's most likely dolphins of other species would have 
been affected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The autopsies have not produced conclusive evidence that the PCBs are the 
cause. The only thing we have been able to determine so far with certainty is 
that the dolphins suffered a weakening of their immune systems." 
</P>
<P>
Piza said there was some speculation the dolphins had contracted a herpes-type 
virus that attacked their immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
Between 12 and 20 infirm or aged striped dolphins are found washed up every 
summer on Spain's eastern beaches and on Majorca, Grau said, but there have 
been more than 100 this year. He said the striped dolphin is not an endangered 
species and is abundant in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists fear that the presence of PCBs eventually may reduce the number of 
dolphins by affecting reproduction in addition to killing the weaker ones, Grau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that only 1% of affected dolphins have washed up," he said, "which 
means the total number that have succumbed to the viral epidemic could be as 
high as 10,000." 
</P>
<P>
Pastor noted that industrial and chemical companies continue dumping tons of 
toxic waste, including PCBs, into the Mediterranean from plants along Spain's 
Mediterranean coast from Barcelona to Algeciras, adjacent to Gibraltar. 
</P>
<P>
"We've called on Spain's autonomous regional governments and the central 
government in Madrid to set up a plan to gradually, but definitively, end all 
industrial toxic waste dumping into the Mediterranean by the end of 1991," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to work with industrial companies directly, but they have refused 
to acknowledge how much they dump into the Mediterranean, saying it might 
reveal industrial secrets to competitors." 
</P>
<P>
He said Greenpeace had found it difficult to develop estimates of the amount of 
PCBs companies in Spain dump into the Mediterranean.

DEVICE IS POSSIBLE CLUE TO EARHART'S FATE

The sighting of a makeshift water-collection device on a South Pacific island 
could be a clue in the disappearance of U.S. aviator Amelia Earhart during a 
1937 globe-circling flight, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
The World War II-era sighting by a former Coast Guard serviceman was reported 
in a letter to Rick Gillespie, executive director of the International Group 
for Historic Aircraft Recovery in Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more, it looks like we're closing in on learning exactly what 
happened," he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Evans, 64, of Annville, Pa., wrote describing the rainwater collection 
apparatus he found while exploring an isolated section of Nikumaroro, about 
1,000 miles northeast of Fiji. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators last year found another possible clue to the Earhart 
disappearance on the island, a navigator's bookcase that could have come from 
Earhart's two-engine Lockheed Electra airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Evans described the water-catching device as a canvas funnel draining into a 
5-foot-by-2-foot metal container. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't build it and the natives didn't build it. If it's Earhart's, who 
knows? People are really getting excited about it, though," said Evans, who was 
assigned to the now-uninhabited island to help build a Coast Guard navigation 
and communications base. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said the dimensions of the canvas and container, as described by 
Evans, closely match the engine covers and one of the 149-gallon fuel tanks 
from Earhart's plane. 
</P>
<P>
It could suggest that Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, survived a 
landing there in July, 1937, and waited in vain for rescue, Gillespie said. 
Evans said he wrote the letter to Gillespie after reading a news report on the 
hunt for Earhart's plane. 
</P>
<P>
"The water-collection structure was on the windward side of the island. The 
water's rough and you can't land a boat. But it was a good spot if you were 
looking for a rescue plane," said Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers theorize that Earhart and Noonan landed on the island's coral reef 
flat, but waves and tides carried the plane into the 2,000-foot-deep trench 
surrounding the atoll. 
</P>
<P>
The team is scheduled to visit the island next summer and may conduct 
deep-water probes for the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's down there, the water is cold enough that it should be well 
preserved," Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
Earhart's possible route was tracked to the island by two retired military 
aviators who used 1930s navigation techniques to plot her likely course. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Willi and Tom Gannon of Ft. Walton Beach, Fla., persuaded the aircraft 
recovery group to mount its $250,000 expedition last year.

SMALL TOWN IN WYOMING GOES BUST IN ILLUSTRATION OF POPULATION SHIFT; 
</P>
<P>
CENSUS: EARLY FIGURES INDICATE THAT THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY HAS LOST PEOPLE TO 
BOTH COASTS. IMMIGRANTS WERE A KEY FACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the main street of Rawlins, Wyo., a shoe store, a drug store, a jewelry 
store and several clothing stores have closed in the last few years. Motel 
rooms go vacant, tract houses stand empty, restaurants struggle to stay open 
and the residents of the dusty little city see their children grow up and leave 
to find jobs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We have hit what we think is bottom," city attorney David Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, Rawlins has ridden to the top of a fuel and mining boom and 
skidded to the depths of a bust. The population, once 14,500, fell by more than 
a third. 
</P>
<P>
And so when the Census Bureau released preliminary 1990 figures recently, the 
numbers confirmed what Clark and his neighbors see daily -- a city on the 
losing side of a dramatic population shift. They know about the lives behind 
the data spinning out of Census Bureau computers. 
</P>
<P>
They reduce to statistics some of the dramatic developments of the last decade: 
economic decline and misery in some parts of the country and burgeoning 
development in others, a stunning wave of immigration, an aging population 
moving to popular retirement spots and young families going beyond the suburbs 
in search of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
The data are the first trickle of what will become a mass of new information 
about the country, garnered from the laborious decennial census conducted this 
spring and summer. Although census officials cautioned that many of these 
preliminary nationwide numbers will change in final tabulations late this year, 
the early figures confirm that the heart of the country is hollowing out and 
the nationwide population of about 250 million is becoming concentrated on the 
coasts. 
</P>
<P>
The population losses in Rawlins and other rural communities reflect the 
economic hardships of farmers, coal and uranium miners, oil workers and 
small-scale rural manufacturers, including farm equipment and lumber mills. And 
the surge of metropolitan growth in the face of rural declines indicates an end 
to the "rural renaissance" of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming, for example, lost more than 4% of its population, while West 
Virginia's declined 8.6% and Iowa lost 5.1%. 
</P>
<P>
"It clearly means there was a greater degree of out-migration than had been 
expected," said Calvin Beale, a demographer at the Agriculture Department. 
"Basically, it is economic." 
</P>
<P>
The numbers also show the significance of immigrants, who accounted for perhaps 
40% of the nation's growth over the decade. 
</P>
<P>
In Brownsville, Tex., for example, where census figures show growth of nearly 
13% -- officials say it is closer to 18% -- the public schools cannot keep up 
with the flood of new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"We take in over 2,000 kids new to the system from south of the border every 
year," said Alejandro Perez, supervisor for admissions. "It's almost a new 
school coming in per year. We're building all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are felt in the everyday duties of Perez's colleagues: More and 
more bilingual teachers are hired, officials deal with the poor educational 
backgrounds of many of the immigrant children and the city faces the costly 
proposition of supporting a quickly expanding school system. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Passell, a demographer at the Urban Institute, said that foreigners 
settling in the upper Midwest and Northeast also kept several states -- such as 
New York, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Massachusetts -- from losing population 
or kept losses at half of what they would have been otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers reflect other trends: 
</P>
<P>
Cape Cod and the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas gained more 
population than was expected, demographers say, because more and more people 
are retiring in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Washington state gained 16.8%, at least in part because of what one social 
scientist called "suburban Angst," middle-class families disenchanted with the 
suburbs in California moving to the open spaces of the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic growth was in California, where the population rose nearly 
24% since 1980. The influx pushed cities such as San Diego and San Jose into 
the ranks of the major metropolises. In some cases, the figures suggest the 
rise of a new economy built under near-sweatshop conditions by immigrants 
willing to work for low wages in clothing and electronics factories. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics for some Southern California communities are stunning. Cathedral 
City in Riverside County grew by more than 600%, to nearly 29,000 residents 
from just over 4,000 a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Victorville, a once-sleepy community in the high desert about 90 miles from 
downtown Los Angeles, the population shot to nearly 39,500 from 14,220 in 1980. 
Here the census numbers paint an increasingly typical picture: A young couple 
moves far out of the city to find an affordable house, then sets up life on a 
landscape of new tracts with few trees and drives more than two hours to and 
from jobs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
City planner John Hnatek described an army of crews laying sewer pipes and 
hanging traffic lights to keep up with the growth: "We have people who come up 
once a month, and every time they come up they see something new they haven't 
seen before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With this extraordinary growth comes political clout. California is expected to 
gain seven seats in the House, for a delegation of 52 and an unprecedented 
opportunity to dominate Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Heslop, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said the 
new seats may act as a "steam valve" for ethnic communities by allowing 
minorities more chances to win elective office at national and state levels. 
</P>
<P>
Heslop and others predicted that, as minorities find representation in state 
legislatures and in Congress, they will focus more on the issues they consider 
important -- education, access to jobs and immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
New regional tensions may emerge. The debate over the infrastructure, for 
example, could increasingly become a competition between the Sun Belt, which 
will need funds for new highways, and the so-called Rust Belt, which has long 
needed to repair old highways. 
</P>
<P>
Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. cautioned, however, that such projections 
are often overdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
"As population goes, so do problems go," he said. He predicted that the 
blossoming cities of the South and West will soon care about the issues that 
predominate in New York and Detroit -- crime, education, solid waste disposal 
and welfare, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the conservatism of high-growth areas may be mitigated with a dose of 
reality, he said. "As these problems rise in the South and Southwest, the need 
for affirmative government to deal with the problems will also rise," 
Schlesinger said.

<TEXT>
<P>
In an era of dying small towns, Ohio paid a price to survive. The gritty 
community of 540 offered cash incentives of up to $5,000 to lure newcomers 
willing to trade big-city amenities for small-town charm. 
</P>
<P>
The results surprised everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Today, vacant homes are virtually non-existent. Most houses boast fresh paint, 
neatly mowed lawns and gardens sprouting flowers and vegetables. There is a new 
subdivision with sewers, water and electrical lines, and construction is under 
way on new houses. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders also hope to land a federally subsidized housing project for older 
residents to free up even more houses for prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"The bounty (money) gets people's attention. But it's not the key to getting 
them here," says Jack Piper, one of the program's architects. "Visitors just 
get such a warm feeling about the community. They see why it's such a great 
place to live." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Ohio had little to offer. "We were suffering because our kids 
were moving out, our population was aging and we didn't have any new jobs," 
Piper says. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Swanson helped organize a town meeting at which "we passed the hat and a 
couple dozen people chipped in." The group formed the Ohio Growth Foundation to 
make one last attempt to generate some expansion. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1989, the foundation launched a modest marketing campaign stressing 
friendly community life, top-notch schools and a crime-free environment, with 
the cash incentive as the centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation offers grants of $3,000 to anyone buying an existing house or 
$5,000 to buyers of newly built houses. The grants are to pay real estate 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"The response was much greater than we anticipated. We weren't ready for the 
calls we got," Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio resembles dozens of remote towns sprinkled among the cornfields of rural 
Illinois. Its classic business district includes a post office, bank, feed 
store, beauty parlor, insurance agent's office, attorney's office, gas station, 
coffee shop and a couple of taverns.

Downtown is bisected by an abandoned railroad right-of-way. The tracks are long 
gone, a sign that often signals the demise of farming communities that had 
developed as rail stops where farmers shipped crops, bought seed, supplies and 
groceries and met friends. 
</P>
<P>
What the railroad left behind in Ohio is Swanson's huge grain elevator. He now 
ships grain by truck rather than boxcar. 
</P>
<P>
The hog sale barn is closed. But Bill Sisler's ice business thrives, along with 
his dairy that produces rich ice cream in flavors such as tin roof sundae. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of rail service left Ohio with intersecting two-lane blacktops as the 
only link to Chicago, 105 miles east, and Peoria, 75 miles south. 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming the remote location wasn't the only obstacle to growth. 
</P>
<P>
The transfusion generated by the cash incentive program had to wait for major 
surgery on the town's heart: its classic old brick school, where grades 
kindergarten through 12 study under one roof in classrooms overlooking a tiny 
gymnasium and stage. 
</P>
<P>
As the town's population dropped over the years, enrollment at school dwindled, 
making it harder to find teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, only 40 children remained in high school and a budget deficit 
loomed. Demographic trends pointed to an aging population and a declining 
birthrate. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than close the school and consolidate with another withering town, 
residents approved a 40% tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're crazy, but we think our kids are worth it," Piper said. "It 
costs a lot to run our school. But we figure, if we spend money on schools and 
send them to college, maybe we won't have to spend a lot of money on jails." 
</P>
<P>
But money alone didn't solve the problem. A catalyst was needed to re-energize 
teachers and students alike, and integrate new ideas without disrupting the 
community's comfortable family environment. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Dagne was coaxed out of retirement from nearby Sterling-Rock Falls where 
he served as school superintendent and school board member. He agreed to help 
Ohio find a permanent administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, he is still on the job and has relocated to Ohio. Dagne has 
caught Ohio fever and he's glad he did. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first moves was to hold private fund-raisers to buy a dozen 
computers for the school. In two years, he raised $8,000 from Ohio residents, 
many of whom don't have children in school. 
</P>
<P>
Next, he renovated a study hall into a library resource center. He also hired a 
retired band director to help build school spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"We were down to eight students, most of whom couldn't read music," Dagne said. 
"I hired a retired band director, Dick Davis, and now we have 40 kids in band. 
They sound great and they are winning awards. And the community really supports 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an example of the difference in the communal feeling of this town. People 
here really are friendlier and concerned about the kids. They really care." 
</P>
<P>
Tony DiCarro saw a news report about what Ohio calls a bounty while 
rehabilitating a house in Florida. "I was looking for the peace and quiet of a 
small town," said DiCarro, who has relocated to Ohio and is gutting an old 
apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
The cash incentive program has resulted in sales of 24 homes -- leaving just 
one vacant house in town.

Six-year-old Kenneth wants his daddy to come back. 
</P>
<P>
When Barrie Leonard found her husband's dirty clothes, just for a moment, it 
seemed like he was home. Then she cried when she thought about where he had 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Zimmerman gets startled looks when he tells people that his wife has 
been deployed to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Tonya Robinson keeps dreaming the same nightmare: saying goodby to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
These families are trying to regain their balance after husbands and wives 
departed 11 days ago aboard the San Diego-based Acadia, sailing for the Middle 
East to assist in Operation Desert Shield. Their departure was abrupt -- the 
destroyer tender was scheduled to ship out in January -- and there are no phone 
calls at sea. Suddenly, their only link is through letters. 
</P>
<P>
The day before Arrington Leonard shipped out, he took an old blue cotton shirt 
and made a snugly pillow out of it for his 6-year-old son. The shirt smells 
comfortingly like Leonard. With his father gone, Kenneth sleeps wrapped around 
the "Daddy pillow." And, when the young boy is upset, he grabs for the pillow. 
</P>
<P>
Barrie Leonard said her 10-year marriage has not always been easy and that her 
husband has left home before. But this deployment is different -- the 
possibility of violence looms larger. Barrie, 30, worries whether her husband, 
a second class petty officer, will return in a body bag. 
</P>
<P>
And she worries whether their marriage will survive the strain of a prolonged 
separation. 
</P>
<P>
"Depending on how he spends his time, it's going to ultimately decide whether 
we stay married or not. He knows that," Barrie said in their Imperial Beach 
apartment. "In my heart, I don't think he's going to blow it, but I guess we 
will find out." 
</P>
<P>
Though less than a week since Arrington, 35, departed, he has already missed a 
number of significant family events: Six-month-old Johnathan's first haircut, 
Kenneth's first day at school, the couple's 10-year wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 My Dear Len: 7 Sept. 1990 2215 HR 
</P>
<P>
 I've been keeping very busy since you've gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys and I went to the park again; Johnathan really likes the grass and 
Kenneth needs to keep busy. He is still having a hard time with this, honey, 
but it's still early into it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kirby (vacuum cleaner) demonstrator came by and did a 2-hour demo (which 
included cleaning quite a bit of our house). They really wanted me to go for 
it, but I had to tell him, "my husband doesn't make major purchases without 
talking to me, and I don't make major purchases without talking to him!" So he 
wants me to talk to you about the Kirby next time you call . . . like we don't 
have anything better to discuss?! 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny got his first hair cut today. And it's forever recorded on tape. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I felt real tired again today. . . . I suppose I'm winding down after all the 
turmoil of your departure. It took a real toll on me, too. I thought I fared 
well, but I'm feeling so tired now. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I wonder how you are doing, my love! Kenny cries for you anytime the slightest 
thing goes wrong for him; and I think Johnny is wondering where his daddy is 
too. I imagine you are keeping busy enough to keep from getting too sad. That's 
what I am doing too! I love you sweetheart. Goodnight. Isaiah 41:10 
</P>
<P>
 Always, Barrie. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Len: 8 Sept. 1990 2145 HR 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Happy Birthday Dear! I know we celebrated early, but I wish I could have 
been with you on "your day!" Hopefully, you had a nice time, considering. I 
miss you, babe! Happy 35th. 
</P>
<P>
 When I checked on Kenneth tonight, he was asleep holding his pretend "Daddy" 
(pillow). I'm glad that it's helping him; I wish I had one, too! . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I came across some of your things while doing the laundry this morning. It 
was, just for a moment, like you could have been there . . . and I could smell 
you . . . but it was just your clothes. It made my eyes tear up -- I miss you 
so. It seems so silly to cry over the laundry, Len, but I did. 
</P>
<P>
 My father called to wish us a happy anniversary and said we "should be proud 
of being able to celebrate your 10th year anniversary, considering the 
hardships you've been through." 
</P>
<P>
 I am just thankful that our marriage is growing and that we're growing even 
though you're far away. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodnight, my love! 
</P>
<P>
Always, Barrie 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Dear Dad, 7 Sept. 1990 
</P>
<P>
 I was wondering if you would like to have this letter and if you miss us. I 
miss you.

<P>
John Hunter, 13, started drawing pictures of airplanes dropping bombs and 
robots menacing soldiers. In one picture, he scrawled: "Nuke Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Kaye Hunter, is ombudsman for the destroyer tender Acadia. And, 
since its departure, she fields about 50 calls daily. Late into the night at 
her Serra Mesa home she is on the phone trying to console young wives, enduring 
their first separation from husbands, as well as those who've been in the Navy 
for years and years. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye Hunter's husband, Chief Petty Officer John Timothy Hunter, 37, has been in 
the Navy almost 17 years and he has shipped out on six-month deployments 
before. But this time, his departure was particularly hard because of the 
abruptness and because of the possible danger. For Kaye Hunter, an organized 
woman who plans well in advance, the sudden deployment jangled her nerves. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye Hunter, 39, is used to chatting with her husband, filling him in on the 
events at the church school where she works. She is used to watching and 
discussing the news with him and taking long drives together. Now she spends 
her evenings bolstering the spirits of spouses and family members who call her. 
She usually waits until late at night, then she breaks down and cries. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother came to visit after the deployment and the two women took young John 
to Disneyland for the weekend. From the hotel bathroom, while her son and 
mother slept, Hunter wrote to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
(Undated, on Disneyland letterhead) 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Tim: 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not a letter from Mickey! 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of John's wound up coming at the last minute, so they are off and 
running, spending those last few quarters, before they burn a hole in his 
pocket! 
</P>
<P>
 Mom and I hit Star Tours right away, as usual. We finally got John on it, and 
he loved it. Just like we figured he would. 
</P>
<P>
 The van is running good. I'm gonna check the oil tomorrow and will make a note 
to check it every Sunday (right after church!). Mom and I went on all the 
(rides) that were slow and cool -- Small World (kill the dolls!), train, etc. 
Let's hear it for air conditioning the roller coaster! 
</P>
<P>
 We finally found that orange stuff mom found last time she was here. Just like 
frozen OJ! 
</P>
<P>
 Our room here is the "suite" type -- a little side room for the kids, 2 
bathrooms, 2 TV's. It's very nice -- AC on high, of course! . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I am doing OK, I guess, but I miss you. This would be a much nicer weekend if 
you were here, too. Did you get your seasick tablets in time? I hope so, or 
else it's gonna be a long trip west! I hope all is well with you and the CD 
player is running fine. 
</P>
<P>
 I love you, Tim. You know, Capt. G was right -- it never gets any easier. I 
find myself thinking, "I've got to tell Tim" and then getting kind of a lump in 
my throat, since, of course, you're not there to tell! Keep yourself safe and 
comfy, honey. I'll write again, soon. 
</P>
<P>
 love,xxoo, 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye. 
</P>
<P>
Many people are startled when 26-year-old Michael Zimmerman tells them that his 
wife, Eva -- a second class petty officer -- was deployed to the Middle East. 
Zimmerman, in fact, doesn't get a lot of sympathy -- since most civilians 
forget that husbands have also been left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Eva Zimmerman's departure was particularly difficult since she is leaving the 
Navy in January. Under the original schedule, her ship was supposed to deploy 
this winter -- and it was an assignment she would have missed. Eva cried when 
she got two weeks' notice to pack her sea bag. 
</P>
<P>
Before she left, Michael Zimmerman asked her where she wanted to be buried. She 
replied: "With you." And they discussed the subject no further. 
</P>
<P>
For Michael Zimmerman, whose mother died when he was 12, the prospect of 
anything happening to his wife is more than he can bear. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just scary. When you love someone, you don't want to think anything will 
happen," said Michael, a Lemon Grove resident who left the Navy to work 
full-time as a courier and attend college at night. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how his life is different without Eva, Michael replied bluntly: "No sex." 
</P>
<P>
There are other changes as well. Michael wakes during the night when her cat, 
Josh, pounces on his chest. "Josh jumps on me and meows -- he looks where Eva 
used to sleep," Michael said. "I say, 'Josh, go to sleep.' We do that night 
after night." 
</P>
<P>
Hi Gorgeous: 
</P>
<P>
 How are you doing on this fine day? I hope all is well and you have not 
forgotten us. 
</P>
<P>
 I have the motorcycle running again. . . . The eight-two brake setup seems to 
work, and I wish you were here to go with me on its maiden voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a motorcycle course that they supply the bike, and it only costs $60. 
The course has three sections, beginning, intermediate, and professional. I was 
thinking once you make it to professional, if you need to take that part, I 
could take it with you. 
</P>
<P>
 When you get back, we could also lower the rear end of the bike by putting 
shorter shocks on it. This would probably make it easier for you to ride. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't go to church today, for I got up at 9:45. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael 
</P>
<P>
Tonya Robinson, 19, met her husband, Seaford, at a picnic in Detroit. This past 
year, things happened in a blur. Seaford, also 19, joined the Navy, the couple 
married, moved to San Diego, and they had their first baby -- Seaford III. 
</P>
<P>
Tonya Robinson doesn't understand how she so abruptly lost her husband, a 
machinist mate. 
</P>
<P>
"I am in a state of shock," said Tonya, cuddling her 2-month-old baby. "My 
husband and I have never been away from each other." 
</P>
<P>
And she is plagued by the same bad dream. Over and over, she dreams that she is 
saying goodby to her husband. "I just hurt inside." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 12, 1990 
</P>
<P>
Dear Seaford: 
</P>
<P>
 Hi Baby, I love you. I miss you and I wish you were here with me. I hate that 
you won't be here for our anniversary, your son's very first Christmas, and 
bringing in the New Year. The most important one is little Seaford's first 
Christmas, I wish you could come home. I just wish we could be together. 
</P>
<P>
 I am still having dreams about when we were saying goodbye to you. I know that 
when you come home we will have to start all over getting to know each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, be careful out there. Remember we love you. 
</P>
<P>
 Kisses, 
</P>

GREAT DISSERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You have done a great disservice to all of San Diego County by advocating that 
the San Diego County Board of Supervisors reverse the county Planning 
Commission's decision on the proposed North County Landfills. ("Planners' 
Rejection of North County Landfill Sites is Far Too Hasty," Sept. 9). 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Planning Commission realized that 90% of San Diego county's 
water might be in peril should these landfills be placed at the three proposed 
sites. Two of the San Diego aqueduct lines adjoin the Aspen Road site in 
Fallbrook and two others are a couple hundred feet from Gregory Canyon in Pala. 
The proposed Blue Canyon landfill in Warner Springs sits at the headwaters of 
the San Luis Rey River, near Lake Henshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Your comment that this rejection will add another year or more to the search 
for a new dump may be true, but isn't adding another year a small price to pay 
to find a solution? 
</P>
<P>
The selection of these three sites was politically motivated. The water 
situation was not properly evaluated. Even county staff admitted in the 
Environmental Impact Report that water was not the highest priority and it was 
weighed equally with other "mitigable or unmitigable" items such as biology and 
socioeconomics. 
</P>
<P>
In these times of environmental awareness, it is ludicrous for those items to 
all have equal weighting. 
</P>
<P>
There are other canyons which can be re-studied and re-evaluated using the same 
criteria as were used for these three canyons. 
</P>
<P>
With the criteria the county has now used for capacity, these smaller canyons 
would probably become acceptable and we could then see if the clay and 
polyethylene liners and the sophisticated drainage systems will work. But let's 
not play Russian roulette with our water supply.

COURT'S RULE ON SECRECY SHINES WELCOMED LIGHT ON CIVIL TRIALS; 
</P>
<P>
MORE WILL BENEFIT FROM PRODUCT-LIABILITY LAWSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, county Superior Court judges are showing their talent for 
innovation. This time, the beneficiaries will be anyone seeking information in 
the sometimes-murky world of product liability. 
</P>
<P>
The court that introduced the fast-track system for civil cases -- a reform 
adopted in courts around the state -- has enacted a rule limiting the kinds of 
information that can be sealed once litigation has begun in civil cases. Even 
defense lawyers concede that the effort to hide damaging information or trade 
secrets has been extended over time to include disclosures that are merely 
embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule, enacted July 1, a three-pronged test must be met before a 
judge will seal an out-of-court settlement or information arising from the 
discovery process in a trial. A court file can remain secret only if 
non-disclosure is in the public interest, the material contains trade secrets 
or other privileged information, and unsealing the file would cause "serious 
harm." 
</P>
<P>
The public obviously stands to benefit. The results of most product liability 
lawsuits -- and other litigation concerning the public interest -- now will be 
routinely available to an interested public, not hidden in sealed settlements. 
</P>
<P>
The rule also will further streamline the judicial process. Plaintiffs won't 
have to pry information out of recalcitrant defendants if it is readily 
available from previous trials. 
</P>
<P>
Will the reform encourage well-heeled defendants to settle fewer claims, using 
their legal might to deter plaintiffs with a long court fight? Perhaps not. If 
someone is hiding information, more will come out in a trial than in a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Will they seek changes of venue, or settle prior to litigation? Perhaps. But if 
other courts adopt this rule, the incentive for changes of venue would be 
minimized. Pre-litigation settlements were always an option under the former 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
The courts are a public forum. Once matters land there, their outcomes should 
be largely open to the public -- especially when the results can have a bearing 
on consumers.

WASTE REDUCTION CONSULTANTS IN DEMAND AS CITIES RACE TO COMPLY; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: GETTING A JUMP ON CUTTING TRASH MAY COST MORE IN THE LONG RUN THAN 
SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EXPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official title of a new law aimed at reducing the amount of trash going to 
landfills is the Integrated Solid Waste Management Act. But privately, 
California bureaucrats have dubbed the state statute the "Consultants' Full 
Employment Act." 
</P>
<P>
Local governments, lacking the staff and expertise to comply with the law's 
required paperwork, and aware that noncompliance could result in daily fines of 
$10,000, have stampeded the handful of environmental consulting firms with 
experience in the field. 
</P>
<P>
The statute is "a consultant's gold mine," said Leslie Legg, an analyst for the 
National Solid Waste Management Assn., a Washington-based trade group 
representing trash haulers, recyclers, landfill operators and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Already, consulting firms have added new divisions, opened new offices and 
hired new employees to meet the skyrocketing demand for their services. The 
danger, many officials and industry experts warn, is that inexperienced 
consultants will provide cities with costly but superficial plans that fail to 
meet the state's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The market for consultants is lucrative. Fees for drafting a city's plan for 
complying with the law's goal -- reducing the amount of garbage going to 
landfills 25% by 1995 and 50% by 2000 -- can range from $50,000 to $200,000, 
officials and consultants said. For groups of cities that join together to hire 
a single consultant, fees can reach $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of not having developed a cadre of trained municipal officials is 
paying through the nose for consultants who may or may not be able to give you 
the best advice," said Joan Edwards, who is coordinating recycling for the city 
of Los Angeles, which expects to hire several consulting firms. "There's a lot 
of gambling going on." 
</P>
<P>
Cities around Los Angeles County are rolling the dice. The city of Glendale in 
January agreed to pay $200,000 for services related to the waste law to a San 
Francisco-based consulting firm that already was working for the city, said 
Kerry Morford, the city's assistant public works director. He said he expected 
the preliminary draft of the plan to be before the Glendale City Council later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the city of Palmdale hired a Santa Rosa-based firm at a cost of 
$173,000, in an attempt to beat the rush to hire consultants. "A lot of cities 
are panicking," said Leon Swain, the city's senior civil engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura Hills is considering teaming with Westlake Village to hire a consultant. 
The two cities have begun shopping for firms and have gotten estimates ranging 
from $75,000 to $190,000. "Some of the estimates are staggering," said Agoura 
Hills City Planner Mike Kamino. 
</P>
<P>
But some consultants cautioned that cities ought not cut corners on drafting 
the plans, which are supposed to analyze the composition of the city's garbage 
and propose ways of reducing its volume. Governments which try to save now may 
be confronted with far greater costs later, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In a practice known as "low-balling," consulting firms sometimes offer to draft 
waste reduction studies at fees far below the average, said Eugene Tseng, a 
private consultant and executive director of EcoSource, a nonprofit group that 
develops waste management training programs. 
</P>
<P>
The practice allows new companies to "get their foot in the door" and helps 
established firms "build up relationships for long-term work," said Tseng, 
whose students at UCLA are drafting a waste reduction plan for the city of 
Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
But the "low-balled" contracts often leave out necessary services that confront 
cities later in the form of additional consultants' fees, Kamino said. 
</P>
<P>
"The cities that haven't done this kind of work don't know necessarily what the 
right balance of work is," said Richard Hertzberg, a senior consultant for 
Resource Integration Systems, a nationwide firm that opened a Los Angeles 
office Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Accurate counts of the number of waste management consulting firms are 
difficult to come by, but a 1989 survey by Legg's organization found no more 
than 10 nationwide with experience in drafting the kind of waste studies 
required under the California law, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The statute, authored by Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo Alto), was signed by 
Gov. George Deukmejian on Sept. 29, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
One of the companies seeking to seize the opportunity presented by the new 
state law is R.W. Beck and Associates, a nationwide environmental consulting 
firm in business since 1942. The company has 30 workers in California -- 25 
hired since the statute, said Gregg Foster, a recycling specialist for the 
firm. "I can't say that that was totally a result of the bill," he said. "But 
certainly it played a major role." 
</P>
<P>
Cities could comply with older waste management statutes simply by burning 
their trash more efficiently. But the new law requires them to produce less 
garbage, and to do that they must persuade the public to change its wasteful 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
The shift in legislative focus has caused consulting firms to hire people 
trained in politics and public relations rather than engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new breed of waste reduction consultants is Foster, 25, who majored 
in public administration in college and spent a year writing guidebooks and 
organizing conferences on recycling before he was hired by R.W. Beck. 
</P>
<P>
The shift away from hard science, some in the field said, has made it tougher 
for municipal officials to distinguish between qualified and unqualified 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
"Recycling is a people-oriented kind of thing, not so much a technical-oriented 
kind of thing," said Bill George, recycling coordinator for the Los Angeles 
County Sanitation Districts, which operates area landfills. He has organized 
consortia enabling a number of cities to jointly hire a single consultant. In 
addition to consultants who have marketing and waste management experience, he 
said, "I want to see people who are activists -- who have experience at the 
grass-roots level." 
</P>
<P>
Some question the value of such generic political skills. "I absolutely think 
there is such a thing as recycling expertise," Edwards said. "I just think 
consultants are going to be hard-pressed to fulfill the high expectations that 
municipalities have for them because the consultants are stretched very thin." 
</P>
<P>
The California Integrated Waste Management Board, the agency created by the 
legislation to oversee its implementation, included in its May newsletter a 
warning to city officials that the board "accepts no responsibility for the 
accuracy of the information provided by others or in forums not endorsed by the 
board." 
</P>
<P>
The state is compiling a list of waste reduction consultants for distribution 
to government officials, said Steven Ault, acting manager of the waste 
generation analysis branch of the board's local planning division. But 
inclusion on the list does not imply endorsement by the state, he stressed. 
</P>
<P>
If history is any indication, some consultants said, the current demand for 
consulting firms will subside in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
"The boom that you see now in the solid waste management area is the same type 
of boom you saw in the early '80s in hazardous materials," said Tseng, 
referring to federal legislation involving the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Other consultants are more confident that the good times are here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"These solid waste problems that we're dealing with today are only going to get 
worse," said Fred Kisner, program manager for contracts dealing with the 
statute for EBA Waste Technologies, the firm that was awarded Palmdale's 
contract. "If you're in the solid waste business, that certainly would suggest 
that there's work on the horizon."

KEEPING AN EYE OUT ON THE FOREST; 
</P>
<P>
REGION'S FIRE LOOKOUTS SEE END OF AN ERA ON THE HORIZON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Fusek is one of a dying breed. 
</P>
<P>
From his perch 8,013 feet above sea level -- a tower near the border between 
Kern and Ventura counties -- Fusek keeps watch over the rugged ridges of Los 
Padres National Forest, scanning the horizon every few minutes, ready to radio 
firefighters at the first puffs of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
On a clear day, Fusek's 360-degree view includes the Sierra Nevada foothills, 
Bakersfield, Palmdale, the skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles and even Santa 
Catalina Island. He said he once saw ships rounding San Pedro -- more than 85 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
But this summer could be Fusek's last season as a professional fire lookout. 
</P>
<P>
Although still widely used in remote parts of Northern California, the lookouts 
have become an endangered species in the state and national forests of Southern 
California, phased out by budget cuts, technology, urban sprawl and smog. 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting few and far between," Don Trammell, district recreation 
officer at Los Padres, said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the backbone of the U.S. Forest Service's firefighting network from Kern 
to the Mexican border, lookout towers have been on the decline for more than 20 
years. The last towers in Angeles National Forest, which covers more than 
600,000 acres of Los Angeles County, were closed about eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lookouts watch over the four counties encompassed by Los Padres from only three 
of the area's seven remaining towers -- Fusek's 54-year-old wooden tower at 
Frazier Mountain and two others near Big Sur. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County still operates two of its 
seven towers and the San Bernardino National Forest keeps three towers open 
using volunteers. A fourth tower in San Bernardino was reopened a few weeks ago 
-- with a paid lookout -- to stand guard over the forest during the hot, dry 
days of September. 
</P>
<P>
Of 65 lookout towers operated by the California Department of Forestry and Fire 
Protection, none are in the 11 southernmost counties. 
</P>
<P>
"The wild lands are getting crowded," Karen Terrill, a department spokeswoman, 
said. "And when you've got a subdivision next door, there's really no need for 
a lookout." 
</P>
<P>
Many fires are spotted by commercial and private pilots, forest officials said. 
In recent years, motorists have begun reporting fires by car phone. 
</P>
<P>
It costs up to $10,000 each year to operate the Frazier Mountain tower, and 
forest officials said financial considerations may force them to close the 
lookout after this fire season. 
</P>
<P>
Fusek admitted that, on some occasions, he has sounded alarms only to be told 
some camper or pilot reported the flames first. Even so, the Frazier Mountain 
tower and its commanding view can still mean the difference between a small 
fire and devastating blaze, Jim Smith, a fire management officer in Los Padres, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For Fusek, the tower is a serene retreat from city life. Fusek, a tall and 
lanky native of North Hollywood who grew sick of traffic, smog and urban 
blight, turned his back on the city after graduating from Cal State Los Angeles 
with a bachelor's degree in geography in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
He worked as a welder, a laborer and a fire lookout in Sequoia National Forest 
before coming to Frazier Mountain in 1985. He lives in the tower's 
8-foot-by-8-foot room five days a week, on watch from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., 
before returning for two days of rest at his house in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at peace with the world when coming down after five days," he said. "I 
feel more lonely in the big city. There's a difference between loneliness and 
solitude." 
</P>
<P>
But solitude is not for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said forest personnel still chuckle about a lookout who, perhaps unable 
to handle the boredom of duty, got drunk many years ago and randomly fired a 
gun all over Frazier Mountain. The lookout radioed his superiors to report that 
someone was shooting at him. 
</P>
<P>
At Frazier Mountain, the solitude is broken occasionally by a stray hunter or 
hiker. The hunters, Fusek said wearily, always ask the same questions: Have you 
seen any deer? Where are the deer? Have you seen any bucks? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he tells them. And that's part of the mountain's appeal. There are deer, 
coyotes, birds and, always, that inspiring view. 
</P>
<P>
The site, about seven miles west of Gorman, has been a fire lookout since 1905. 
The tower, a boxy wooden structure with peeling Army green paint, was built in 
1936 at Camuesa Peak in Santa Barbara County and then relocated after a forest 
fire destroyed the Frazier Mountain tower in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
It's equipped with a small bunk, a television set, a stove, and a contraption 
called the Osborne fire finder, which Fusek uses to plot the exact coordinates 
of a fire. Taped to the side of the fire finder is a Far Side cartoon of a 
lookout, burned to a crisp, surrounded by untouched forest. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked behind the bunk is a small insulated stool Fusek stands on during 
electrical storms for protection. The closest lightning strike he ever saw hit 
a nearby electrical transformer. 
</P>
<P>
Fusek is supposed to scan the mountains every 15 minutes. But in reality he is 
always on guard, and while chatting with visitors recently, he now and then 
shifted his eyes to the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
The worst blaze in Fusek's career at Frazier Mountain was the Fishbowls fire of 
1987, named for a campground several miles to the south. It was 11:50 a.m., 
Fusek said, when he casually glanced up and saw a blue-black plume. 
</P>
<P>
After reporting the fire, all Fusek could do was watch as 5,000 acres were 
charred. "It's kind of a helpless feeling for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There's more to being a lookout than just watching the horizon, he said. 
Lookouts must recognize the slight gradations of color and movement which 
distinguish a fire from dust devils or steam rising from a wet road warmed by 
the sun. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit, Smith reminded Fusek of smoke he reported seeing several 
days earlier. A helicopter flew over the site and the spotter decided it was 
only steam. 
</P>
<P>
But two days later, a fire broke out in the exact spot, Smith said. The blaze 
had been smoldering. Fusek had been right after all. He nodded slightly with 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Fusek admitted later that he has mixed feelings about reporting fires. "To 
prove yourself, you want to see a smoke," he said. "But you don't want to see a 
big smoke."

FLORES' 'WHERE WAS EU?' CAMPAIGN DEVELOPS IRONIC TWIST; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SECRETARY OF STATE MARCH FONG EU WILL SPEAK MONDAY IN WILMINGTON. 
THAT JUST HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS AREAS OF OPPONENT JOAN 
MILKE FLORES' CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In campaign stops across the state, Republican challenger Joan Milke Flores has 
sought to portray incumbent March Fong Eu as an "invisible secretary of state" 
who has refused to engage the issues. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, a Los Angeles city councilwoman from San Pedro, has fashioned her 
underdog campaign against one of California's top vote-getters in past 
elections around one basic query: "Where was Eu?" 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, at least, the answer should be simple. Eu will be in Flores' 
own district at the invitation of some of the councilwoman's biggest 
detractors. 
</P>
<P>
Eu is scheduled to speak to a group of Wilmington residents who are leading an 
effort to break the community away from the city of Los Angeles. The meeting is 
to begin at 6 p.m. at the VFW Hall, 1130 W. Anaheim St. 
</P>
<P>
Eu's office describes the visit as a routine voter registration appearance. 
Among other things, the secretary of state serves as the chief elections 
officer, and Eu has been traveling statewide lending a hand to registration 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the renegade Wilmington group, however, say they invited Eu with 
something else in mind: namely, to draw attention to their gripes about the 
city of Los Angeles and to embarrass Flores, their representative at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"If Joan Milke Flores can't even run a small community like Wilmington, how can 
she run something at the state level," said Joe Mendez, a young father and pipe 
fitter who arranged Eu's visit for the New Wilmington Committee. "I think this 
should probably lock up the race for Eu." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schwab, a retired merchant mariner and longtime Wilmington activist, said 
Eu's appearance is intended to shake up both Flores the candidate and Flores 
the councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured it would be a good way to get Flores off her back porch," said 
Schwab, complaining that Flores does not spend enough time tending to the 
community's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Flores has a standing invitation to address the New Wilmington group but has 
not yet done so. 
</P>
<P>
Wilmington has long been one of Flores' most thorny constituencies. The 
three-term councilwoman sailed to reelection last year with more than 70% of 
the vote districtwide, but she was outpolled in Wilmington by a poorly funded 
schoolteacher who has since joined the secessionist effort. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Wilmington's 72,000 residents complain that they live in the shadow of 
neighboring San Pedro, are ignored by their elected officials and have been 
shortchanged on essential city services ranging from police protection to 
street sweeping. Some residents refer disparagingly to run-down neighborhoods 
as the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything in the community is germane to the secretary of state 
race," said Phil Peterson, president of the Wilmington Historical Society. "But 
some members of the community see this as an opportunity to put the plight of 
their community before a greater audience." 
</P>
<P>
Flores plans to campaign today and Monday in San Diego, but she said she may 
show up unannounced at the Wilmington meeting Monday night to confront Eu. 
</P>
<P>
Eu has for the most part ignored Flores and has not even scheduled a formal 
campaign appearance aside from occasional fund-raisers. Eu, first elected 
secretary of state 16 years ago, has never faced a serious reelection 
challenge. A recent Los Angeles Times poll showed her leading Flores by a 
nearly 4-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Flores charged last week that, so far in the campaign, Eu "has been hiding. She 
may see this as her chance to discourage me in my own back yard, but I am very 
secure in my district. I don't embarrass easily." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, Eu said that she did not know that the New Wilmington 
Committee was a secessionist group and that she had no intention of using the 
appearance to attack Flores. She said her remarks will be limited to voter 
registration. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no disguised efforts," Eu said. "I am very dedicated to voter 
registration. I respond to all kinds of invitations for my attendance at these 
voter registration-type events because it is one of my very strong priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of Eu's professed intentions, New Wilmington members said Eu's staff 
is well aware of the political implication of the appearance. Mendez said he 
first arranged the visit through the secretary of state's office in Los 
Angeles, but last week he was on the telephone finalizing plans with Miyun Lim, 
Eu's campaign director. 
</P>
<P>
"She is going to talk about voter registration, but the reason she is going to 
be here is because it is Flores' back yard," Mendez said. "It benefits her and 
it benefits our cityhood drive." 
</P>
<P>
Leo McElroy, a Sacramento consultant running Eu's reelection campaign, said 
Friday that the visit was not a campaign appearance, although he acknowledged 
that it may have the appearance of one. 
</P>
<P>
"She is clearly going into Joan Flores' back yard, and that is an area that 
chronically has low voter registration," he said. "But we are not sending out 
campaign press releases on the darn thing." 
</P>
<P>
Mendez said the New Wilmington group had originally invited Eu to spend the day 
in the community, touring neighborhoods and seeing some of their problems 
firsthand. A press release distributed by the committee last week said Eu would 
speak about her office's "roll (sic) in the incorporation of new cities and the 
importance of voter registration in any community." 
</P>
<P>
Eu's office eventually cut the stay to one hour and by the end of last week had 
recast the appearance solely as a "voter registration rally," Mendez said. The 
office also insisted that all questions during the meeting be submitted in 
writing so that they could be screened by members of Eu's staff and the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really pushing for her to be here at least part of the day, but all I 
could get was an hour," Mendez said. "But we aren't disappointed. We haven't 
had somebody at that level recognize this community in a long time. I think you 
would have to go all the way back to President Taft, who rode through at one 
time."

Dolphin Park in Carson will take on the sounds and tastes of Mexico today as 
the city hosts its 13th annual Mexican Independence Day celebration. The music 
of mariachi bands, salsa bands and romantic Latin combos will fill the park 
from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and foods along with arts and crafts will be available 
at 20 booths decorated with green, white and red -- the colors of the Mexican 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
Eight popular performing groups from Mexico and Central America will entertain 
at the park at 21205 Water St. The party will be emceed by Humberto Luna and 
other on-air personalities from Spanish-language radio stations KTNQ-AM and 
KLVE-FM. 
</P>
<P>
Park director Glenn Salas said that when city budget cuts left him unable to 
hire a band for the annual celebration, he appealed for sponsors and the radio 
stations responded. "They're bringing all the entertainment and setting up the 
stage," he said. "This will put Carson on the Hispanic map." 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters will have their own game booths, and young children will be able to 
break pinatas for the candy prizes inside. The Carson Clowners, a group of 
senior citizens in clown costumes, will entertain. Booths will be operated by 
Carson community, church and cultural organizations, as well as private 
vendors. Proceeds from booth rentals will be used for city youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
With several thousand people expected at the fiesta, an elementary school lot 
across from the park will augment on-street parking. GERALD FARIS

REFLECTIONS: 'THEY (TURTLES) HAVE SURVIVED EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED ON THIS 
PLANET EXCEPT FOR MAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chula Vista resident Phil Golden didn't own a single turtle until he was 32; 
then he bought his first turtle and then another and another. Counting birthday 
turtles and adopted turtles, he quickly went from one to 20. He's owned 
three-toed box turtles, a peach-colored South American water turtle and a 
3-inch Chinese golden head turtle. Forced by illness to give up most of them, 
he's now content to paint them. Turtle lovers can find him at Kobey's Swap Meet 
on Saturdays, where he sells the paintings to benefit the San Diego Turtle and 
Tortoise Society. Golden was interviewed by Times staff writer G. Jeanette 
Avent and photographed by Bob Grieser. 
</P>
<P>
My first experience with turtles was when I was a little boy in Kansas. As kids 
we grew up building tree forts and playing with turtles. 
</P>
<P>
The ornate box turtle is the state reptile, and we had turtles all over. But, 
as an adult, I got my first turtle eight years ago. I quickly went from one to 
20. 
</P>
<P>
When I was living in Mission Hills, everybody knew I was the turtle man. I was 
getting turtles from everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
One time a neighbor just brought a turtle in a box, rang the door bell and just 
left it there. It was walking down the street, somebody saw it and brought it 
to me. 
</P>
<P>
I've had turtles from 5 to 50 years old. The smallest, a Chinese golden head, 
was about 3 inches across. The largest I had was a South American water turtle 
about 14 inches across. He was a beautiful, beautiful turtle with coral colors 
all over the skin. The skin was all peach and pinks. 
</P>
<P>
A pet shop up in Washington had brought him in. I got him through a person up 
there who would visit pet shops, and if he saw a turtle that wasn't cared for 
properly, he'd buy it. The turtle was really sick when he got it. 
</P>
<P>
Turtles require a lot of care. It took him about a month to get it real 
healthy, and he contacted me through the turtle club. 
</P>
<P>
I also had a Chinese golden head that I could call and he would run to me. 
</P>
<P>
People just wouldn't believe me, but I'd go out in the back yard, and I'd yell 
his name, which was Butterworth, and he would look up and find me and run to my 
foot. He'd get on my foot and look up at me. There was no reward involved. I 
would just pick him up and talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
I'd put him down and walk to another part of the yard and do the same thing, 
and he'd run to where I was. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't just a fluke. I used to carry him on my shoulder with one hand, and 
he'd always have one arm up like he was waving. He was my favorite turtle in 
the world, but he met his demise by a neighbor's dog. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes you get a temperamental one. I had one that would only eat popcorn 
for about a month, and I decided that wasn't a balanced diet so I starved her 
off popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
I put all the food out there she should have. She was a Florida box, very 
temperamental and very melodramatic I'd have to say. 
</P>
<P>
She was supposed to have fresh fruit and vegetables grated up and sometimes 
some smelt and some Science Diet dog food for a balance of minerals and 
vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
I was having popcorn, and I gave her some and that was it. She wouldn't eat 
anything else. 
</P>
<P>
It was scary. I thought she was going to starve and fall over any minute. But 
one day she finally ate and got over her little problem. 
</P>
<P>
I had a Gulf Coast box, a male, a large one which was a gift for a birthday one 
year. He was sort of the John Wayne of turtles. All the female turtles followed 
him around everywhere he went. 
</P>
<P>
He was this light tan color and all the females were this darker color. He 
always had females climbing all over him, which is really unusual. Usually the 
males are aggressive. He was sort of a stud, and they all liked him. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't start painting turtles until about 2 years ago. When I was just out of 
the Army in 1972, I started out taking art classes at Palomar College. 
</P>
<P>
But I left art for a while and went into show business. I worked at the 
Starlight and the Globe theaters, and I did that for 10 years. I sang, danced 
and acted, and I also taught. 
</P>
<P>
I was also the resident choreographer at the Old Town Opera House, now United 
States International University's theater. 
</P>
<P>
Then, about 2 1/2 years ago, I began studying art with Peter Everly in Ocean 
Beach. The first painting, a sunset at Puget Sound, took me seven months. But I 
learned almost all the techniques that I've used since. 
</P>
<P>
The first turtle I painted was a desert tortoise in a desert scene. 
</P>
<P>
Since then I've taken paintings and prints of my paintings to the swap meet 
just to bring funds into the club. 
</P>
<P>
Kobey's donated a space for us as a nonprofit organization, and last year I 
raised about $2,000 for the club. 
</P>
<P>
The main thrust of the organization is public education. 
</P>
<P>
It's very hard to kill a turtle. They've outlived the dinosaurs. They have 
survived everything that's happened on this planet except for man. 
</P>
<P>
Now many turtles are endangered because of pollution, mistreatment, crossing 
over the boundaries of the desert tortoise with four wheelers, sewage in the 
ocean, (drift) net fishing, and markets for their shells. 
</P>
<P>
I feel the best way I can get involved is this way. I would like to be 
recognized as an artist who specializes in endangered species and who does 
realistic work.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE BURNS 100 ACRES OF BRUSH IN AGUA DULCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire burned 100 acres of brush in Agua Dulce on Saturday afternoon before 
firefighters extinguished the blaze, the Los Angeles County Fire Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire burned in the 32000 block of Agua Dulce Canyon Road, north of the 
Antelope Valley Freeway, said Los Angeles County fire dispatcher Teresa Rios. 
It broke out at about 2:30 p.m. and was controlled in less than two hours, said 
Fire Department spokesman Kerry Brisson. 
</P>
<P>
No structures were threatened and no one was injured, Brisson said. The cause 
of the fire was under investigation.

'FURIOUS' AT POLICE OVER QUESTIONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barbara Nagy, I feel what happened to your students is par for the course 
("Teacher Angry After Police Search Latino Youths Invited to Her Home," The 
Times, Sept. 9). It has happened to me too many times not to believe it is so. 
</P>
<P>
For example: Last week while my daughter and I (teachers) stopped at Manhattan 
Mall for a quick purchase, her Latino husband waited in the car, in the back 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
Two Manhattan Beach policemen questioned him. Why was he here? Who owned the 
car? Did he steal it? Did he have a gun? Did he have any drugs? Was he waiting 
for an accomplice to run out? Why was he eating in the car? He showed his ID 
and they left. But why did they question him? He was just sitting there!! 
</P>
<P>
I've become so anti-police, but I have to remind myself that most police are 
young and very naive -- still think in prejudicial stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
I'm still furious.

CENTINELA FILES SUIT TO AVERT PAYING NASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for the Centinela Valley Union High School District filed a lawsuit 
last week asking the Superior Court to rule that the district is not obligated 
to pay nearly $375,000 in salary and benefits to former Supt. McKinley Nash, 
who was fired in July. 
</P>
<P>
Nash, who had been superintendent of the racially divided school district since 
1984, has demanded that he be paid $327,562 for the three years remaining on 
his contract, as well as $46,000 in unrealized vacation benefits. The black 
administrator was fired by the Latino-majority board a few months after a 
two-day student walkout and in the middle of allegations of racial bias in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the district contend that Nash had no valid contract with the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, district lawyers contend that on July 1, 1989, in 
"apparent anticipation of defeat . . . in the fall elections," former board 
President Aleta Collins extended Nash's contract to June 30, 1993, without 
discussing it with other board members. 
</P>
<P>
District lawyers also said they found two versions of Nash's contract, one of 
which included a clause specifying that if Nash were terminated, he would be 
paid for the unexpired portion of his contract within 60 days. The other 
version had no such provision. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1989, the school board ratified the contract containing the 
severance pay clause, but district lawyers say the contract was invalid because 
two versions of it existed and neither had been properly reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Nash was not available for comment, and his attorney, George W. Shaeffer Jr., 
declined to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Collins also was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after ratifying Nash's contract, Collins and two other Nash supporters, 
Ann Birdsall and Herb Bartelt, were defeated in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday night, Birdsall, who has been a staunch critic of the 
current board, expressed shock over the district's claims regarding Nash's 
contract. She said that Nash had asked the board to include the severance pay 
clause and that she and her colleagues had voted unanimously in closed session 
to grant it to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're just playing games because they don't want to pay Dr. Nash his 
money," Birdsall said.

BODY FOUND IN SANTEE CREEK BED 
</P>

<P>
Sheriff's homicide detectives Saturday were investigating the death of an 
unidentified man in his 50s whose body was found in a creek bed in Santee. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide Sgt. Steve Wood said the man appeared to have been in the water for 
about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Coroner Cal Vine said cause of death was unknown and an autopsy was 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
The man's body was found by passersby about 8:30 a.m. Saturday in a creek 
alongside the 9500 block of Prospect Avenue, Wood said.

DANA POINT DEALS WITH DUAL CHALLENGE; 
</P>
<P>
THE NEW CITY MUST REDEVELOP OLD DISTRICTS WHILE CHARTING A COURSE FOR THE 
FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Point is trying to deal with its history and its future at the same time. 
Either one alone would be a tall order for any city planning effort, but the 
two taken together present a special challenge. The public should take 
advantage of the opportunity to attend some of the open houses planned for 
different parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point has this unusual challenge because it is tackling two aspects of 
city planning at the same time. It has a history, going back to the days of the 
1920s, when development was haphazard. Some very good plans for such amenities 
as parks and a marketplace were never implemented. The Depression hit, and the 
best-laid plans for the future were set aside. 
</P>
<P>
And yet Dana Point is just taking off as one of Orange County's newest cities, 
having been incorporated less than two years ago. So the city must engage in 
urban redevelopment at the same time it tries to chart a course for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Because so much of the development of Orange County is recent, the concept of 
redevelopment is fairly new and is associated mostly with older areas. But Dana 
Point has old neighborhoods to attend to even as it tries to fulfill a 
requirement of state law that, as a new city, it produce a general plan within 
30 months of incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
If all this sounds like a paradox -- a new city charting a brand-new course and 
yet dealing with old problems -- well, welcome to a fascinating part of the 
county, perhaps best known for its tidy harbor. 
</P>
<P>
For the redevelopment, Dana Point has targeted four areas, all suffering from 
blight. 
</P>
<P>
The Lantern District has about 167 acres of teeming apartments and small 
residences that have classic problems of urban decay. 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor Bluff, an area overlooking Harbor Drive, has unstable bluffs and 
unstable Cove Road. 
</P>
<P>
Doheny Village is an area of about 148 acres in the old Capistrano Beach area 
along Doheny Park Road that has been identified by police as a high-crime area 
with deteriorating homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The PCH Couplet is a mainly commercial area that needs sprucing up. 
</P>
<P>
The general plan must be put together first, then the city will use money from 
a redevelopment agency to pay for any changes that are made. The challenge will 
be to preserve some the area's small-town charm while rooting out blight and 
decay. But it's a task worth meeting, and one residents very much ought to be 
involved in.

WOULD A HANDGUN BAN REALLY HAVE AVERTED DANA POINT DEATH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most recent tragedy of the handgun shooting of an 18-year-old boy by a 
16-year-old points up the urgency of the passage of the Brady Bill (H.R. 467), 
which would require a seven-day cooling off period for handgun sales. 
</P>
<P>
At present, this bill is seven votes short of passage in the House of 
Representatives and needs voters to prompt its support by their congressmen 
who, like ours, are still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
The price for delay will be more innocent children killed in the crossfire.

ROUTING A TOLLWAY THROUGH SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is more to San Clemente than Avenida Pico. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor Candace Haggard says it's "devastating" if the proposed tollway 
linking the Tustin and San Clemente areas has to be routed through San Clemente 
instead of Camp Pendleton to connect with Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
We wonder if she and her ilk paused a moment to think that the route through 
Camp Pendleton is devastating to San Clemente residents and property owners who 
live on Avenida Santa Margarita, especially the beginning of Avenida Santa 
Margarita from El Camino Real, where the proposed tollway is located within 300 
feet or less of our residences. (Yes, the southern end of town is considered a 
part of San Clemente.) 
</P>
<P>
Did the San Clemente city officials and our other elected state and federal 
officials stop to think about the effect this massive roadway project will have 
on the San Clemente community with regard to increased freeway noise (in 
addition to Interstate 5), traffic, air and water (aquifer) pollution? 
</P>
<P>
We wonder just how much the mayor, city officials and our state and federal 
officials care about San Clemente, its environment and its families, residents, 
and property owners. 
</P>
<P>
We wonder how much they care about preserving the pristine natural habitat on 
Camp Pendleton and state land. 
</P>
<P>
We wonder how much they care about the Earth and its ever-increasing fragility 
to the damaging effects of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
At the next and subsequent elections, we will remember our elected officials as 
they have remembered us.

WOULD A HANDGUN BAN REALLY HAVE AVERTED DANA POINT DEATH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One Dana Point teen-ager is dead and his alleged 16-year-old assailant in jail, 
largely because of the lack of strict gun-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
Teens might normally settle severe arguments with a fistfight, perhaps ending 
with a couple of black eyes or, at worst, a few broken teeth. 
</P>
<P>
A gun-control law with real teeth in it might result in some lost teeth for 
teens, but not death and incarceration.

SOUTH COUNTY OR NORTH COUNTY FOR JAIL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I noted from the responses to your editorial ("Time to Deal in Jail Realities," 
Aug. 22) that those most supportive of putting a jail on that site are from 
central and southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Those people are right; it is time for NIMBY to stop. Let's build the jail in 
South County. There is more unused land there than in the northern section. 
</P>
<P>
Laughably, one South County resident asserted that people living near the jail 
will benefit from it. If this is the case, then he would surely be an advocate 
of placing the jail in his neighborhood (it could even be built on one of the 
greenbelts).

IRVINE'S POLITICAL SUCCESSION PROPOSAL IS SLOPPY, DECEITFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan of Irvine won her office by a narrow margin 
last June, she pledged to "heal Irvine." It has been interesting to watch her 
healing hand at work in the city since the election. 
</P>
<P>
First, public comment at City Council meetings has been cut short, and no 
direct criticism of the council or its members is now permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the religious commitments of one group of residents is being given 
preferential status at City Hall through the planned introduction of a 
Christmas tree and the move to open City Council meetings with an invocation. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in spite of a court order directing the city to seat elected 
Councilwoman Mary Ann Gaido, Sheridan and her allies on the council appear 
determined to subject the taxpayers of Irvine to a costly and potentially 
divisive special election in November. 
</P>
<P>
In each of these cases, the council has imposed the political and cultural 
commitments of its staunchest supporters on the city at large. These tactics -- 
the stifling of dissent, the association of city government with the religious 
practices of one group of residents, and the attempt to exclude a fairly 
elected city council member -- are designed not to "heal" the city but to 
repress the healthy expression of differences within this politically and 
culturally diverse community. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether the residents of Irvine will tolerate this kind 
of high-handed, repressive city government. For all our sakes, I hope that they 
will not.

SOUTH COUNTY OR NORTH COUNTY FOR JAIL?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read, then laughed, at the Sept. 9 letter to the editor by Suzanne Hutchinson 
about placing a new jail in Gypsum Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Her first sentence, "It's time for NIMBY to stop," was refreshing. I agree. 
</P>
<P>
Her last sentence, however, "Let's build a jail in Gypsum Canyon now," coupled 
with her address, Huntington Beach, revealed her true colors. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach is a comfortable 20-plus miles from Gypsum Canyon. That's 
definitely not in her back yard.

All my life I've heard about "Everyone Else's mother." 
</P>
<P>
Every time I told my kids they had to have the car home by 11, I was informed, 
"Everyone Else's mother said they could stay out until 2." 
</P>
<P>
When I stood firm that they could not have a phone of their own or a separate 
listing, they grumbled, "Everyone Else's mother lets them have their own 
phone." 
</P>
<P>
No bathing suit was too revealing for Everyone Else's mother to put her stamp 
of approval on. No allowance was too generous for her to shell out. She was the 
Good Fairy of children everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
My friends and I used to talk about this mother a lot. Was she a myth created 
in the minds of children who wanted to be free from parental decrees, or did 
she really exist? All I really knew was that she was always with us, following 
us around from city to city, school to school, year in and year out. 
</P>
<P>
You cannot imagine my surprise recently when I met Everyone Else face to face. 
She called herself Jan, but I knew from the moment she opened her mouth she was 
Everyone Else with the famous mother. She told me her story. 
</P>
<P>
From the moment she was born, she got to do whatever she wanted to do. She went 
to bed and got up when she felt like it. If she craved jelly beans and coffee 
for breakfast, she got it. 
</P>
<P>
No one nagged her to shut the door, sit up straight, clear the table or make 
her own bed. She could drink out of everyone's glass at parties if she wanted 
to. 
</P>
<P>
She drank milk out of the carton, and no one yelled at her. She was rude to 
people and never had to apologize. She made mistakes and never had to be 
accountable for them. 
</P>
<P>
She picked her own clothes, her own schools, her own friends. She was the envy 
of all her contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I could stand it no longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Jan, for years I've heard about your mother. Somehow, she's the perfection 
that none of us has been able to touch. I would love to meet her." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone Else just looked at me and slowly repeated the word love. You'd have 
thought it was the first time she had ever heard it.

ZAN THOMPSON: OUR MAN IN THE CATALINA CONSERVANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Propst was going home a couple of weeks ago, driving along one of the 
inland roads that crisscross the tall rugged mountains of Santa Catalina 
Island. Doug and his wife, Joan, live at Middle Ranch in the center of the 
75-square-mile island. The Propsts work grueling hours but they don't seem to 
know it. 
</P>
<P>
Doug is president of the Catalina Island Conservancy and Joan raises horses, 
teaches riding and is a Pony Club director. They have found the ideal life, 
living with animals and nature and setting their clocks to the rhythm of the 
winds, the pounding of the surf and the songs of birds. 
</P>
<P>
On his way home, Doug saw a small animal out of the corner of his eye. He 
slowed his pickup truck and saw that it was a Catalina Island fox, no larger 
than a big house cat, with the crisply pointed ears and pointed muzzle of the 
larger mainland fox. She was silver gray with a tawny blend and had a black 
muzzle tip and creamy white cheeks. She looked back at Doug and then he noticed 
that she had a pup beside her. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Doug slowed as he went by the spot and there was the proud mother 
again. This time she had three pups with her. She shooed them back into an old 
water pipe that was sticking out of the ground. Then the pups' curiosity took 
over and three small faces poked out of the pipe and watched Doug, who left 
quietly so as not to upset the family. That's one of Doug's small rewards, to 
talk to the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Propst became president of the Catalina Island Conservancy in 1975. Three 
years before, members of the William Wrigley family who had purchased the 
island of Catalina from the Bannings, a pioneer California family, established 
the conservancy as a nonprofit organization dedicated to the conservation and 
preservation of the island. Mr. and Mrs. Philip K. Wrigley and Dorothy Wrigley 
Offield, through the Santa Catalina Island Co., deeded 42,135 acres of the 
island along with almost all of the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
There are several trees and plants that only grow on Catalina Island. One of 
these is the ironwood tree that grow in groves in the steep canyons and on the 
north-facing mountain slopes. It has a shaggy red bark and a canopy of dark 
green leaves. The conservancy's native plant horticulturist, Janet Takara, has 
established an nursery at Middle Ranch to help restore the groves. 
</P>
<P>
Doug showed Joan and me the Tarqua Cave, a great rock mountain with sides 
scooped away by weather or shifts of land. It was a shelter for Indians, near 
the ocean for fish, rich with plant life. UCLA has been doing an archeological 
dig there and signs show that the Gabrielenos and Chumash may go back 10,000 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Not Honey Bee. She goes back 30 years, which is a very long time if you're an 
Arabian mare. The girls in the Pony Club, which is a part of a national group 
of young riders, had a birthday party for the gray lady, complete with a 
birthday cake. Grunt the pig, and Geraldine, the donkey who hates men, watched 
the party with appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
We stopped by a pasture when a foursome of beautiful Arabian horses galloped 
wildly with manes and tails flying across a green carpeted paddock. Doug said, 
"See that old Arabian leading the pack. He runs like a yearling and if you put 
a saddle on him, he'll droop and stand like the oldest horse in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Surely, Middle Ranch is not only a wonderful place for the Propsts to live and 
to have raised their daughters but it's paradise for elderly horses. 
</P>
<P>
As Doug and Joan and I were going along a steep mountain road, we passed a 
Catalina Island Co. tour bus. The driver rolled down his window and said, 
"Pardon me, would you have any Grey Poupon?" 
</P>
<P>
Doug said that he did that every time they passed and they were often the only 
two cars in the back country. 
</P>
<P>
On top of the island at the airport, the conservancy is building a nature 
center with walls holding paintings of animals, plants, archeological finds and 
geological wonders of Catalina Island. The biologist in charge has discovered a 
kind of cricket indigenous to the island. He gave it a proper Latin name and 
then added propsti. Doug is the only man I ever knew who has a merry cricket 
named after him. 
</P>
<P>
It is gentling to the spirit to know there is such a place as the Catalina 
Island high country and people like Doug Propst who hold it in trust for 
campers, hikers, riders, fishermen and just people who need to know such a 
place exists, just there, at the edge of the world.

IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS AS JEFFERSON PUPILS GET NEW CLASSROOMS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: NEVER MIND THAT THINGS WEREN'T QUITE FINISHED BY OPENING DAY; 
TEACHERS, PARENTS AND CHILDREN WERE MORE THAN PLEASED WITH NEW MODULAR 
BUILDINGS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early one morning last week, more than 1,000 parents and children, along with 
dozens of younger brothers and sisters in arms or in strollers, streamed 
through the gates of Jefferson Elementary School for their first look at their 
new school. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything was perfect on opening day Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A few classes had to double up because construction was incomplete on some 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The electricity was not hooked up, so the new air-conditioning did nothing to 
lower the sweltering temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
The restrooms were not ready on time, so workmen were unloading portable 
toilets at the same time students were arriving. 
</P>
<P>
The few inconveniences did nothing, though, to diminish the enthusiasm of the 
Jefferson School community. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like Christmas to the parents and children," said Sylvia Perez, 
whose two sons attend Jefferson. "It's just like moving into a new house." 
</P>
<P>
The old Jefferson School was composed almost entirely of portable classrooms 
that were decayed, termite-infested and so old that nobody in the district 
could remember when they arrived. There are only four permanent classrooms at 
the school. The cafeteria, library and restrooms were all housed in the 
substandard portables too. 
</P>
<P>
Generations of Jefferson children attended classes in the dilapidated wooden 
buildings. "I went to this school when I was growing up and I'm 32 years old," 
said Jeff Arviso. "It's about time they put some money into this." 
</P>
<P>
Trustees of the Compton Unified School District voted to replace the old 
buildings with new ones only after The Times found an engineering report saying 
the old buildings did not meet earthquake and fire safety standards. In August, 
bulldozers knocked down the rows of old bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised there's school at all. I didn't think it was going to be ready," 
said Jenine Arviso. She and her husband, Jeff, have two sons at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen parents coming in saying, 'We're going to get involved,' " Perez 
said. "The morale was always low for the parents and the teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson has long been a community gathering place for the Latino families 
that began crowding into the north side of Compton before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"At Christmas we won't have to climb on the tables to see the performance," 
said another parent, Zenaida Domingo, as she eyed the new cafeteria foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The cafeteria will not be completed for more than a month, but it will be large 
enough to double as an auditorium. Like the new classrooms, it is a modular 
building. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of school, teachers took their classes on tours of the campus 
because the 22 new buildings have been placed in a different configuration. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember now, where will you pick up your little brother from kindergarten?" 
teacher Lolita Alejo said by way of driving home the point that the three 
kindergarten classrooms have been moved to the opposite corner of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
For school administrators such as Kenneth Flood, who supervised the work at 
Jefferson, creating a new school in little more than six weeks was almost 
"Mission Impossible." Contractors had to work seven days a week and Flood and 
other administrators did not know until opening day whether they would make the 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
There were contingency plans for almost everything. "Just don't let it rain," 
said Flood, who has arranged for sack lunches to be distributed outside every 
day until the cafeteria is finished. 
</P>
<P>
With last-minute registration, with parents and children trying to find the 
right classrooms, and with workmen still on the site, Principal Alfredia Nabors 
was maintaining an air of calm. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the teachers, 'Do not panic.' If they remain(ed) calm, the kids would 
be calm. The parents would be calm," Nabors said. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see all the parents that were here this morning," Nabors added 
joyfully. "They were thrilled. Everybody was here to see it."

OPPOSITION EXPECTED TO WASTE SITE NEAR SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: THE STATE AND THE EPA PROPOSE TO ISSUE PERMITS TO BUILD A PLANT TO 
TREAT HAZARDOUS MATERIALS LESS THAN A BLOCK FROM HOMES AND HUNTINGTON PARK 
HIGH.

HUNTINGTON PARK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to build a plant to treat hazardous waste less than a block from 
homes and Huntington Park High School is expected to draw strong opposition 
during a public hearing Tuesday night at the school. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services and the Environmental Protection Agency 
are proposing to issue permits to Chem-Clear Inc. that would allow the firm to 
treat daily up to 120,000 gallons of hazardous industrial waste. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, state and federal officials will decide whether to issue the 
permit or to require that changes be made in the operation of the proposed 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
The plant would be built in an abandoned factory at Slauson and Boyle avenues 
in heavily industrial Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
The site is on Huntington Park's northern border, a stone's throw from the 
school and homes. Residents, students, state legislators and even the Los 
Angeles Board of Education have opposed the plant since the proposal came under 
public scrutiny about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial wastes, including hexavalent chromium, acids and other hazardous 
chemicals from Los Angeles area factories, would be hauled to the facility by 
tanker on freeways and city streets. Water would be separated from the 
materials and disposed of by sewer. Sludge containing hazardous metals and 
other materials would be hauled to a landfill in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park High health teacher Richard Loya is one of the plan's most 
vocal foes. He has taught his students about the potential dangers of the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"As a teacher, I have to be concerned about the safety of my kids, and this is 
adding extra risk," Loya said. "Do we need that added risk in this area, 
especially right across the street from the school?" 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for Chem-Clear, which is owned by a subsidiary of Union Pacific 
Railroad, said the plant would enable area factories to dispose of their waste 
safely, rather than store it in leaky barrels or dumping the waste illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a need for a facility like this, to get this stuff, deal with it and 
get it out of the community," Chem-Clear spokesman Xavier Hermosillo said. 
</P>
<P>
A study by a private firm assessing the health risks the plant would pose has 
been completed since the last public hearing was held in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The study, sure to be the focus of Tuesday night's hearing, indicates that 
plant emissions would not pose a substantial risk. 
</P>
<P>
The plant would not incinerate wastes but would emit minute amounts of 
hazardous chemicals during processing. Depending on the waste treated, those 
emissions could include tiny amounts of such chemicals as benzene, a 
carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
The study indicated that such emissions would cause, at most, fewer than one 
additional case of cancer per million people -- well within the range 
considered acceptable by state health officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel that anyone would be at risk from breathing the air," said 
Florence Pearson, senior hazardous materials specialist for the state 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
But the study indicated that a spill at the facility or by a truck hauling 
hazardous waste could cause injuries. One scenario cited by the study would be 
a spill from a 25,000-gallon drum containing waste that is 18% hydrochloric 
acid, the maximum concentration of hydrochloric acid that would be allowed in 
waste processed at the facility. Dikes would contain the spill but vapors would 
escape into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Such a spill is an extremely unlikely, worst-case scenario, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any individual located in the immediate vicinity of or directly downwind and 
close to the accident site would be likely to suffer serious adverse health 
effects," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Those effects could include burns to the nose, throat, lungs and skin, and even 
death. In such a spill, vapors could reach the school, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
But Pearson, the state specialist on hazardous materials, said: "There are a 
tremendous number of safeguards that are built into the process that would 
prevent this from happening." 
</P>
<P>
Up to 8,000 gallons of flammable waste would be stored at the site in a special 
room designed to keep a fire from spreading, the report said. The study cited 
many variables and did not predict what sort of health risks would result from 
toxic smoke produced from such a fire. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosillo, the Chem-Clear spokesman, said the firm has made some concessions 
because of public concern. For example, Chem-Clear dropped plans to treat 
cyanide waste, although the proposed permit would allow cyanide waste to be 
stored at the facility before being transported to the Utah landfill. 
</P>
<P>
But those concessions have not yet won over foes such as Assemblywoman Lucille 
Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), who are concerned about the proliferation of 
such plants in populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not convinced that it's not going to pose some danger to the 
existing school that's right across the street," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing begins at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Huntington Park High Auditorium, 
6020 Miles Ave., Huntington Park.

DEVELOPER, WHITTIER TO SPLIT $2.4 MILLION IN EXTRA SHOPPING CENTER COSTS

<P>
City officials have agreed with a developer to split about $2.4 million in 
unplanned costs of the proposed Whittier Station Center, a much-debated 
shopping center opposed by historic preservationists, American Indians and 
enraged motorists. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement eliminates the reason for a potentially costly lawsuit filed last 
month by the Encino-based developer Urbatec against the city. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, Urbatec had accused the city of violating its agreement to 
provide the developer with the 16-acre triangle of land northwest of the city 
center. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, in turn, said the developer is responsible for delays that 
increased the city's costs by about $2.4 million. City officials said the costs 
for land the city bought and for the overall project increased by the time 
Urbatec provided the $12.5 million that had been agreed on. The city also 
underestimated the cost of relocating businesses from the site. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, approved by the City Council last week, gives both sides what 
they want most. Urbatec gets the go-ahead to take possession of the land by 
Nov. 1 to begin construction well before year's end. 
</P>
<P>
The city lightened its financial burden for a project that proved more 
expensive than anticipated. The developer will foot the costs of putting 
utility lines underground and relocating storm drains. In addition, Urbatec 
will contribute about $1.2 million for the city's unexpected costs. 
</P>
<P>
The developer was not legally obliged to pay more merely because the city had 
underestimated how much the project would cost, company attorney Mark S. Novak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, city officials presented the company with a choice, Novak said. 
"Do you want the project or do you want a lawsuit?" 
</P>
<P>
Urbatec chose the project, Novak said. 
</P>
<P>
Varied citizens groups would have preferred otherwise. Preservationists have 
opposed the shopping center because it would displace a 100-year-old train 
depot. 
</P>
<P>
City officials agreed to save the depot by moving it to an empty lot about a 
quarter-mile away, but the move could permanently strip the depot of its status 
as a national historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
A group of local Indians also sought to stop the project. They say an Indian 
burial ground is at the site. The city has invited an archeological firm to bid 
on a study of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Should a burial ground be found, which city officials say is unlikely, the 
project could be further delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, local motorists were enraged to learn recently that the development 
would result in a permanent closing of Magnolia Avenue between Whittier 
Boulevard and Hadley Street. 
</P>
<P>
About 130 people crowded into Tuesday's public City Council hearing on closing 
the street. The comments ran more than 3 to 1 against the idea before the 
council approved the closing, 3 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
Abandoning that section of road will effectively eliminate a popular 
north-south shortcut between Beverly and Whittier boulevards. Leaving Magnolia 
alone, however, would have nullified Urbatec's city-approved design. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, speakers complained of the timing. "Why is this hearing being 
held now, rather than a year and a half ago, or two years ago, or three years 
ago?" resident Charles Hanson asked.

GRAND JURY WON'T RULE ON PARKING GARAGE DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

Monterey Park 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Grand Jury has decided not to get involved in a 
longstanding dispute between Monterey Park and several residents over a parking 
garage, city officals announced. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the City Council asked the Grand Jury to look into resident's 
complaints that a newparking structure at Garvey Medical Center violates the 
city's three-story maximum for that area. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say it is legal because it is a parking structure, not a 
commerical building, and is exempt from the three-story rule. 
</P>
<P>
But the grand jury's Government Operations Committee said that although it 
found no misconduct when the city approved construction of the parking garage, 
ruling on its legality is not within its jurisdiction, Mayor Judy Chu said. 
Grand jury officials could not be reached for comment.

COMING TO TERMS WITH MEXICAN AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
CHICANO POLITICS REALITY AND PROMISE, 1940-1990 BY JUAN GOMEZ-QUINONEZ 
(UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PRESS: $29.95, CLOTH; $15.95, PAPER; 253 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gerald W. Haslam, Haslam's latest books are That Constant Coyote: California 
Stories (University of Nevada Press) and Coming of Age in California (Devil 
Mountain Books). He teaches English and ethnic studies at Sonoma State 
University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In surveying 50 years of political activity in the Chicano . . . or Mexican . . 
. or Mexican-American community -- this difficulty in labeling mirrors the 
society's complexity -- Juan Gomez-Quinonez unfolds a story of bigotry endured 
and aspirations thwarted. Despite such heady moments as the National Chicano 
Moratorium of 1970 and the success of the United Fruit Workers' grape boycott 
the same year, frustration is the enduring theme of this study. 
</P>
<P>
To the dominant society, a Mexican may be a Mexican may be a Mexican but, from 
within, Mexican America is diverse and contentious: "a complex social island in 
the midst of the United States," writes Gomez-Quinonez, a professor of history 
at UCLA and a one-time political activist, in this landmark study. Mexican 
America also is the fastest-growing ethnic community in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The reality of a shared border and shared history have produced a binational 
culture that is churning but private, even mysterious, to outsiders. There are 
Americans of Mexican descent of all colors; there are those whose 
great-great-great-grandparents were born here and those who arrived this 
morning; there are Chicanos striving to overturn the Treaty of Guadalupe 
Hidalgo and others who simply want their fair chance at the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
Two passages, neither ostensibly political, nonetheless clarify the scope of 
Gomez-Quinonez's task in this chronological survey of Chicano political 
experience over the last 50 years. On the opening page, the author notes, "The 
terms Mexican(o), Mexican descent, Mexican American, Hispano and Chicano are 
used in an interchangeable way and also in distinct ways." It is difficult to 
clearly define this varied, often fragmented community. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Quinonez concludes his study with these lines: "What remains to be done 
is to recognize and deal with the heterogeneity within the Mexican community . 
. . Mexicans must come to terms with the political process and social reality, 
and then deal with them as they are." Illusions of homogeneity and idealized 
solutions must be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
While only a minority within the Chicano community has been politically active, 
that group has been busy indeed. In this book's pages, an astonishing list of a 
acronyms and abbreviations for political organizations flip by like fanned 
cards: PAPA, CIAA, CSO, LULAC, MAPA, PASSO, LRUP, MAYO; among many others, 
various schemes -- El Plan de Delano, Plan de la Raza Unida, Plan de Santa 
Barbara, etc -- are developed; gifted leaders emerge -- Dennis Chavez, Henry B. 
Gonzalez, Edward Roybal et al -- during the half-century surveyed by 
Gomez-Quinonez. Finally, though, "Minimum objectives have been pursued and 
minimum objects have been achieved." 
</P>
<P>
Why? "One reason is the lack of a center for a broadly distributed community. . 
. . There are no unifying overarching institutions. . . . There is no core set 
of beliefs or aims. . . ." Most of all, though, asserts the author, "the 
dominant society . . . determines what and who is politically legitimate 
vis-a-vis Mexicans and within the Mexican community" 
</P>
<P>
Places and people may differ -- northern New Mexico, with its small villages 
and long history of Mexican political involvement is radically different from 
the heated fields of south Texas or the crowded barrios of Los Angeles -- but 
all have suffered from misperceptions held by the dominant society, 
Gomez-Quinonez tells us, as well as from being taken for granted by the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Except for that recurrent theme of thwarted Chicano aspirations, the actual 
story that Gomez-Quinonez tells is too intricate and detailed to adequately 
summarize. High points begin with his coverage of World War II when "perhaps 
400,000 Mexican Americans served in the armed forces. Not one was charged with 
desertion or treason, and they suffered casualties above proportion of their 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Sharing that great effort with other kinds of Americans "led to a new optimism 
in the Mexican communities of the United States regarding the postwar period." 
What returning soldiers actually found was "rampant discrimination" that 
prompted the formation in 1948 of one of the most effective of early Chicano 
political groups, the GI Forum, whose national organizer was Molly Galvan, one 
of the first Chicanas to achieve political prominence. 
</P>
<P>
"The Forum utilized United States patriotic symbols and rhetoric," explains the 
UCLA historian, "and therefore occupied a secure position in its attempt to 
defend Mexican civil rights, representing a constituency with undeniable claims 
and demonstrable supportive needs." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1960s and '70s, the emergence of Cesar Chavez and the United Farm 
Workers was easily the most visible event in Mexican America, and its political 
implications are examined in this text. Less well known, however, were 
organizations such as CASA-HGT (Centro de Accion Social Autonoma-Hermandad 
General de Trabajadores), "the most salient progressive organization 
functioning in the Mexican community" during the '70s. In many ways CASA-HGT 
pointed toward the future, since it stressed "the development of national and 
class consciousness among activists" and recognized that "the possibility for 
radical social change in the United States is linked to an international 
process. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The '80s were characterized by a paradoxical conservatism. Earlier radicalism 
in the Chicano community had "forced certain concessions from the Anglo 
mainstream . . . (and) created a setting from which a viable middle class 
emerged within the community." While the Reagan years also were a time of 
significant economic setbacks, "the community remains tempered by a uniquely 
Mexican concern for cultural continuity and political affirmation, while it is 
ambivalent as to how pluralistic the allegedly diverse system is." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this important book is neither compellingly organized nor 
crisply written. It is structured like a doctoral dissertation, opening with a 
turgid chapter on methodology and theory. The author is at his best in Chapter 
5, where he examines contemporary perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, "Chicano Politics" merits a reader's perseverance because it 
offers vital perspectives. If Gomez-Quinonez occasionally sounds like a 
frustrated radical in his scorn for the situation of Chicanos ("Mexicans in the 
United States do not have a state structure of their own") or the American 
system ("it advocates order because, simply put, order best serves so-called 
society"), he finally emerges as a pragmatist. 
</P>
<P>
Of idealized Chicano nationalism, he writes, "A rejection of the dominant 
society and a romanticized search for Mexican ties and bonds was an explainable 
process." Moreover, despite the heady demonstrations of the 1960s and '70s, he 
points out that "Neither white radical nor liberal groups have as yet served 
Mexicans well." And, with immigration and linked economies looming large, 
Gomez-Quinonez nonetheless points out "the limits of real understanding" 
between citizens of Mexico and Chicanos. 
</P>
<P>
This historian seems to have learned from hard experience the limits of 
idealism, and his thorough knowledge of the past makes his advice about the 
future compelling. With a growing population and cultural presence, 
commensurate political power for Mexican-Americans can be achieved, he 
suggests, only through "the continuing development of both single-membership 
advocacy and confrontational groups." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, on a national as well as regional level, "Crucial to this development 
is the need for generalized national political consciousness, agreed-upon 
priorities, and principled leadership."

RICHARD EDER: AN UNAPPEASED SPIRIT:THE GENERAL IN HIS LABYRINT BY GABRIEL 
GARCIA MARQUEZ TRANSLATED BY EDITH GROSSMAN (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 230 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1830, Simon Bolivar, the brilliant and paradoxical figure who liberated much 
of South America from Spain but failed in his dream of keeping it together, 
resigned his office. With a few loyalists, he journeyed down the Magdalena 
River to the coast, where he would die a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who has written so much of the true history of the 
continent by imagining it, has taken this last, little-known venture by its 
supreme historical figure to write a meditation on power, old age and the 
destiny of his people. 
</P>
<P>
"The General in His Labyrinth" takes a dying phrase of Bolivar's -- "How will I 
ever get out of this labyrinth?" -- as the marvelously well-placed keystone for 
the book. We die when our life gets lost in the tangle of its own journey. A 
great life is a great journey and a great tangle. Garcia Marquez's Bolivar 
fights to keep hold of the contradictory thread of an unappeased spirit facing 
eviction from a failed body. 
</P>
<P>
Like the patriarch who daily makes a will and tears it up, Bolivar -- old, 
shrunken and ill after 47 years of prodigious life -- is avid to relinquish his 
power and to retain it. He resolves to abandon the effort to make a mighty 
state out of Latin America -- "I have plowed the sea," he wrote -- while he 
plots and struggles to go on with it. He exercises a spacious wit and 
generosity while carrying out crabbed maneuvers of calculation and distrust. 
One boot on Charon's barge and one hooked firmly to the river bank, he departs 
and remains at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
It is a barge, in fact, that he will board -- one of seven -- after an arduous 
mule-back trek from the highlands down to the upriver port of Honda. A river is 
one of the great classical images of life, and Garcia Marquez intends the 
Magdalena -- which he used so powerfully in "Love in the Time of Cholera" -- to 
mark a life's illusions and regrets, and the drift into its end. 
</P>
<P>
First, though, comes the introductory scene, the best in the book: the lion 
cornered by his enemies and by his own confused passions. Having resigned the 
presidency and waiting in vain for the congress to call him back, Bolivar 
proclaims his instant departure for Europe. Yet nobody -- not his enemies, his 
friends, nor perhaps himself -- has any certainty as to whether he will 
actually go. 
</P>
<P>
We meet him, tiny and feverish, floating in the bath in his customary deathlike 
trance. Jose, his loyal servant, comes before dawn to prepare him for the 
journey. "Let's go as fast as we can. No one wants us here," Bolivar had 
commanded. But he has announced his departure too often. "He won't leave and he 
won't die," is the slogan scratched upon the walls of Bogota, his capital. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition suspects him of wanting to perpetuate his rule, and name his 
successor. Furthermore, much of the local Colombian establishment, led by Gen. 
Santander -- it evolved into the Liberal Party that would battle in successive 
civil wars with the Conservatives, who trace their lineage to Bolivar -- wants 
an independent country it can control, and not an unwieldy federation that 
could threaten it. In each of the states, in fact, a separatist faction 
opposes, and eventually will prevail over, the Bolivarians. 
</P>
<P>
The days of hesitations, of visits, of delegations bidding him farewell -- some 
hoping to persuade him to remain, others fearful that they will succeed -- are 
a poignant and ironic dance of veiled signals. Bolivar assembles a few personal 
items in a knapsack -- "We never would have believed that so much glory would 
fit into a shoe," he says grandiloquently, while arranging for seven pack mules 
to carry the rest. It is both fraudulent and authentic, and so are the lines 
that put an end to this introductory section: 
</P>
<P>
"It was the end. Gen. Simon Jose Antonio de la Santisima Trinidad Bolivar y 
Palacios was leaving forever. He had wrested from Spanish domination an empire 
five times more vast than all of Europe, he had led 20 years of wars to keep it 
free and united, and he had governed it with a firm hand until the week before, 
but when it was time to leave he did not even take away with him the 
consolation that anyone believed in his departure." 
</P>
<P>
And indeed, throughout the slow, arduous trip downriver, struggling with 
sickness, greeted at each river port by killer banquets and deadly ceremonials, 
we follow Bolivar fluctuating in his labyrinth, recalling the past, dissembling 
before the present and the future. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he never does board the ships that his staff successively books and 
cancels. He will die in Santa Marta, still planning military actions against 
separatists in Colombia and Venezuela, and sending ambiguous answers to a new 
government in Bogota that begs him to come back. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marquez, as always, is doing several things at once. There is the 
portrait of the caudillo fighting his last battle: a dying that shatters his 
visionary solipsism by forcibly introducing him to the society of worms. There 
is the hot fecundity of the continent's lowlands, so fecund that, as we have 
seen in the author's previous books, life is hospitable both to a thing and its 
opposite. Magic realism, we call it; stress the realism. 
</P>
<P>
There is, now that the author is embroidering upon a real figure, a more 
explicit political message. His Bolivar, for all his vices and self-will, 
represents a grand destiny that Latin America has lost to a small-minded 
bourgeoisie that masks its greed with constitutional pieties. In the author's 
general, we glimpse his own affinity to Fidel Castro; not as a political saint, 
but as the mythic monster that fits his vision of his world. 
</P>
<P>
All these things make "The General" a distinguished book. It is not, however, 
anywhere up to the masterpieces: "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and "Love in 
the Time of Cholera." The incidents of the journey, the appearance of ghosts, 
memories and sweating mayors are quirky and alluring. But they seem choppy and 
repetitive or even forced. The Magdalena provides a sluggish binding current; 
it is a river of mud that only intermittently becomes a river of legend. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia Marquez's power seems curiously hobbled in dealing with a historical 
figure on the scale of Bolivar. He splendidly presents his image of Latin 
America and of a great man redux. Redux apart, his protagonist lacks the 
teeming variety, the strength, the mysterious and comic vitality; in short, the 
magical reality -- and thus, the reality -- of Col. Buendia in "One Hundred 
Years," or of the trio of geriatric demigods in "Love."

MORALITY PLAY IN THE SOUTH BRONX; 
</P>
<P>
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THE OUTLANDISH STORY OF WEDTECH BY JAMES TRAUB (DOUBLEDAY: 
$21.95; 368 PP.); 
</P>
<P>
FEEDING THE BEAST HOW WEDTECH BECAME THE MOST CORRUPT LITTLE COMPANY IN AMERICA 
BY MARILYN W. THOMPSON (CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS: $22.50; 320 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert L. Jackson, Jackson is an investigative reporter in The Times 
Washington Bureau who covered the Wedtech scandal. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Mariotta, the Puerto Rican immigrant businessman who founded the now 
notorious Wedtech Corp. of the South Bronx, was consumed with a desire to make 
it big -- for himself, for his family, for his employees and for his country. 
</P>
<P>
So much so, we are told, that the trappings of success became almost more 
important to him than the bottom-line corporate figures of his fledgling 
defense-contracting enterprise: big limos to take him and his fellow executives 
to meetings; dinners at expensive restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
But it seemed Mariotta never knew where to stop. As with many aspects of 
Wedtech, the money spent on furnishings alone was beyond all bounds of 
propriety. Flushed with his initial success at winning some Army and Navy 
contracts, Mariotta turned the executive suite of his former machine shop in 
the downtrodden Bronx into a palace worthy of the last days of the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire. He bought miles of heavily brocaded silk to cover the 
ceiling-high windows of his office, adding Persian carpets and antique 
breakfronts. A chandelier fit for a grand ballroom hung in the plant's small 
entrance foyer. 
</P>
<P>
The almost bigger-than-life story of how the founders of this "house of fraud" 
corrupted congressmen, lawyers, officials of the Small Business Administration, 
former White House aides and New York state officeholders is told in an 
entertaining fashion by free-lance writer James Traub, who pored over thousands 
of pages of court records and interviewed many of the defendants and federal 
prosecutors. The influence-buying scandal broke in late 1986 and eventually 
resulted in about two dozen convictions for bribery, conspiracy, fraud and 
racketeering. It wound down last year with the convictions of San Francisco 
lawyer-lobbyist E. Robert Wallach, a longtime friend of former Attorney General 
Edwin Meese III, and New York Congressman Robert Garcia, the second of two 
congressmen to fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Too Good to Be True," James Traub's well-organized narrative, laced with humor 
and replete with anecdotes, captures the human side of all the malefactors who 
peopled this major domestic scandal of the Ronald Reagan years. (The other big 
case would be HUD, and the foreign-affairs scandal, of course, was Iran-Contra, 
which Traub notes ironically broke about the same time.) 
</P>
<P>
By way of explaining his book's title, Traub shows us that what gave Wedtech 
its initial entree to the Reagan Administration was the makeup of the firm. 
Originally known as Welbilt Electronic Die Corp., its founder, Mariotta, was an 
energetic Latino, and a Republican to boot, at a time when Reaganites wanted to 
woo Latino voters and to encourage the principles of private enterprise instead 
of government handouts, particularly in an area such as the economically 
ravaged South Bronx. Invited to attend a White House meeting of small 
businessmen, Mariotta and his company soon became what Traub has labeled "the 
White House poster child." 
</P>
<P>
But folks who at first promoted the firm for free in the inner circles of 
government -- folks like Wallach, Meese's friend, and Reagan political director 
Lyn Nofziger -- ultimately latched onto high fees from Wedtech in return for 
their lobbying work. Nofziger, of course, waited until after he had left the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
Such importuning by paid friends of Wedtech (it changed its name in going 
public in 1983) helped win for it a no-bid $30 million minority-enterprise 
contract to produce Army engines and other government work, including a Navy 
portable-bridge contract that eventually would have been worth $400 million if 
Wedtech had performed well. 
</P>
<P>
But the company's reach exceeded its grasp; high living by its executives, 
payoffs to congressmen and state officials and excessively high fees paid to 
lawyers and political consultants in return for their influence drained the 
small company. All that, combined with poor management and shoddy workmanship, 
brought Wedtech to eventual bankruptcy. The dream vanished when its several 
hundred workers, mostly blacks and Latinos, lost their jobs as Mariotta and his 
colleagues, along with public officials, went off to jail. 
</P>
<P>
Traub suggests we may look upon Wedtech as sort of a morality play that 
includes the cynical bribe-payers -- the top officers of the firm -- and 
recipients who surrounded the company like flies around a honey pot. But the 
play, he suggests, is neither straightforward nor satisfying. It has to do with 
deceit and self-delusion, that faculty which permits men to believe what is 
useful for them to believe. Mariotta and his executives believed they were only 
doing on a smaller scale what large defense contractors accomplish with their 
campaign contributions and their employment of top officials who retire from 
the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Traub's painstaking account of the rise and fall of Wedtech is at its best in 
using the Wedtech case to illustrate how the Washington influence game works; 
at its worst when it is burdening us with minute details about too many bit 
players in the military-contracts and lobbying field. Yet, even without an 
index, which would greatly assist serious scholars of this scandal, Traub's 
book organizes a complex and often confusing array of criminal charges into a 
sprightly narrative of novel proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Where in American literature, for example, is there a more rapacious figure 
than Mario Biaggi, the corrupt New York congressman, who -- unhappy with the 
prospect of straightforward payoffs -- demands a piece of Wedtech itself and 5% 
of every government contract he can swing its way? Or where a more tragic 
figure than lawyer Bob Wallach, a longtime liberal identified with human-rights 
and civil-rights causes in San Francisco, who receives a stiff six-year prison 
sentence for allegedly receiving illicit payments from Wedtech to lobby Meese 
and work for a cause he probably deemed just? 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Thompson's "Feeding the Beast" is a more detailed book on the 
characters who people the Wedtech story. An investigative journalist who came 
to know them first-hand, Thompson began investigating the scandal for the New 
York Daily News in 1986, and her award-winning articles helped bring the case 
to national attention. 
</P>
<P>
While Traub relies largely on legal documents and the official transcript of 
the Wedtech criminal trials to tell his story, Thompson bases her book heavily 
on interviews with federal prosecutors, defense lawyers and many of the 
principals themselves. It results in a somewhat slower-paced but richer telling 
of the Wedtech story. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson is at her best when she is describing the background and character 
traits of the Wedtech malefactors. Describing founder Mariotta as a masterful 
manipulator "who could convince a host of government agencies that his two-bit 
machine shop deserved better than the small contracts on which it had 
subsisted," Thompson reveals that the up-by-the-bootstraps Puerto Rican 
struggled with an inferiority complex traceable in part to the fact that he was 
illiterate until adulthood. His co-founder, Fred Neuberger, was a Romanian-born 
Jew who escaped the Holocaust, became an Israeli "freedom fighter," was known 
for his hot temper and once plotted to murder Mariotta because of a policy 
dispute, Thompson tells us. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her closeness to the case, Thompson tells her story as a straight 
reporter without interpretation. One wishes she had drawn more lessons from 
Wedtech, much as Traub does.

FERLINGHETTI THE ARTIST IN HIS TIME BY BARRY SILESKY (WARNER BOOKS: $24.95; 294 
PP.)

Lawrence Ferlinghetti is one of those well-known people whom few people know 
well. To some extent that's because Ferlinghetti -- poet, publisher, 
bookseller, novelist -- is a private man; although he cooperated with Barry 
Silesky, himself a poet, on this volume, he clearly dislikes having his beliefs 
and motivations looked into. 
</P>
<P>
More significant is the fact that Ferlinghetti's poetry has never received much 
critical attention; it tends toward the transparent, the everyday, seeing much 
but revealing little. It's a surprise, consequently, to learn that his most 
noted collection, "A Coney Island of the Mind" (New Directions, 1958), has more 
than a million copies in print worldwide -- more than any book by any other 
living poet, and almost twice as many as Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" -- which 
Ferlinghetti published two years earlier through his own press, City Lights. 
</P>
<P>
Silesky provides a mild, workmanlike account of Ferlinghetti's life to date, 
and though drawing few conclusions, makes it easy to guess at the origins of 
Ferlinghetti's sensibility. Dropped off at an orphanage at age 6 because his 
mother was hospitalized for emotional problems and his great aunt couldn't 
afford to rear him, Ferlinghetti ended up the ward of a wealthy, elderly couple 
in a New York suburb. 
</P>
<P>
The Dickensian echoes don't end there; in his teens, he was arrested for 
shoplifting the same month he made Eagle Scout, and, after college, went to sea 
-- joining the Navy, where he captained an escort boat during the D-day 
invasion of France. Ferlinghetti would return there in 1948, enrolling as a 
graduate student in the Sorbonne and intending to be a writer of some kind . . 
. a writer, one projects after reading this book, who took transience for 
granted, who found the notion of authorial "depth" a luxury. 
</P>
<P>
Silesky doesn't attempt such amateur psychologizing, which is just as well, 
considering the dearth of clues that Ferlinghetti gives in his work. One 
reason, no doubt, that Ferlinghetti was much more popular in the 1960s than he 
is today -- and currently is more respected abroad than at home -- is that he 
writes for readers, not critics, dispensing with subtext and deliberately 
aiming to be accessible. Another reason is that his poetry -- what there is of 
it, Ferlinghetti now devoting most of his time to painting -- is overtly 
political. Ferlinghetti described himself in "Open Eye, Open Heart" (1973) as a 
wind-up toy: 
</P>
<P>
 someone had dropped wound-up 
</P>
<P>
 into a world already 
</P>
<P>
 running down.... 
</P>
<P>
The verse nicely captures the open, almost sweet dissent of his best poetry. 
Silesky's book is above all a tribute to a similarly minded poet, interesting 
if not particularly enlightening.

THE CANDOR OF AN IMPOLITE CRIPPLE; 
</P>
<P>
CARNAL ACTS BY NANCY MAIRS (HARPER &amp; ROW: $18.95; 176 PP.; 0-06-016494-8) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Janet Kaye, Kaye is a lawyer and writer who teaches Women and Media at Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All of us share "the task of making meaning out of life's ambiguous bounty," 
Nancy Mairs writes in the introduction to this collection of essays and one 
short story. 
</P>
<P>
Mairs' bounty has been limited by multiple sclerosis, "a chronic incurable 
degenerative disease," she writes, which "limits physical freedom and 
satisfaction -- without turning either to jelly or to stone." 
</P>
<P>
Her greatest adversary in these pages, however, is society, which, she writes, 
fails to acknowledge the presence of the disabled much as it has eclipsed the 
value of women. 
</P>
<P>
In TV sitcoms, for example, a problem is presented and resolved "in no more 
than half an hour. . . . No show depicts the same problem week after week. The 
audience would get bored and switch to another channel." 
</P>
<P>
In real life, of course, problems can go on, and on, and on, and sometimes (as 
is true for Mairs' physical condition since her MS was diagnosed 17 years ago) 
worsen. 
</P>
<P>
Mairs believes fear of physical vulnerability is the reason why the disabled 
are not accurately or adequately portrayed. "To depict disabled people in the 
ordinary activities of daily life is to admit that there is something ordinary 
about disability itself, that it may enter anybody's life," she theorizes, so 
that advertisers, "who determine nowadays who will get represented publicly and 
who will not, deny the existence of me and my kind absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
Even the language currently in vogue to describe her state strikes Mairs as a 
dangerous effacement of reality. In the essay "Challenge: An Exploration," 
Mairs calls the new phrase "physically challenged" "pure bellywash," adding "I 
don't see how that phrase distinguishes me from . . . say, the latest climber 
struggling up the face of Mount Everest." So, Mairs says, "I call myself a 
cripple. I do so because the word is the most accurate and precise I've found, 
meaning that I no longer have full use of my limbs." 
</P>
<P>
In different essays, she addresses the need to be a "polite cripple" and a 
polite woman. As a writer firmly committed to the truthful, often blunt 
exploration of her life as both, Mairs can therefore be considered rude indeed. 
For example, she writes: "My self-esteem diminishes further as age and illness 
strip from me the features that made me, for a brief while anyway, a 
good-looking, even sexy, young woman. . . . No more lithe, girlish figure: My 
belly sags from the loss of muscle tone, which also creates all kinds of 
intestinal disruptions. . . . No more sex either, if society had its way . . . 
. Cripples simply aren't supposed to Want It, much less Do It. Fortunately, 
I've got a husband with a strong libido and a weak sense of social propriety." 
</P>
<P>
Mairs states that her relentless examination of her self and her relationship 
to society has caused "mentors and editors (to wonder) aloud when I'll get 
around to some 'real work,' by which they seem to mean something perhaps less 
personal and certainly less 'limited' by feminist perspective." But, she says, 
the reality is that much more still needs to be written by women and by the 
disabled about their lives. They need, she states, to continue "uttering the 
unspeakable. Women must go on simply and without apology saying aloud what it 
is like to be who they are." 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult, though, Mairs says, to find a market for such utterances. I 
know she's right. A year ago, my father lapsed into a coma. And, when two 
months into it, I wrote an essay about how it felt to be a woman turning 40 and 
confronting her mortality as well as her father's, the editor of the first 
magazine to which I sent it wrote me a letter calling the piece touching but 
"personal and unresolved" -- as if by those words alone he'd established its 
unpublishable nature. 
</P>
<P>
The danger then, for Mairs as for me, is that two, three or four pieces about 
the issues she is confronting can seem redundant in a way that the umpteenth 
article about the latest hot celebrity does not. Because we are reluctant to 
confront issues of disability at all, someone who does so twice may be 
perceived as having done so at least once too often. 
</P>
<P>
And, in truth, there is some redundancy to these previously published essays. 
But there is also much variety. Mairs describes her trip to Zaire to visit a 
daughter in the Peace Corps. She details her participation in a protest at the 
Nevada Nuclear Test Site. In each case, her disability complicated but did not 
prevent her from living the life she wished to lead. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Mairs disclaims heroism. "I'm only as brave as I have to be," she says, and 
titles a later essay "I'm Afraid. I'm Afraid I'm Afraid." In it, she states, 
"Radical terror . . . now grounds my life . . . any day now I'll be bedridden 
and unable to take care of even my most basic needs." At an earlier point, she 
says of her physical condition, "I am the woman I thought I could never bear to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Mairs writes of all this with scrupulous, sometimes discomforting honesty -- 
and often with an unruly wit. She has already done so in her prior collection 
of essays, "Plaintext," and in her memoir "Remembering the Bone House." 
</P>
<P>
Let us hope she will do so again.

<P>
A poetic novel of despair, hope and the redemptive power of the soil. The loss 
of his right hand in an accident embitters Andy Catlett, a journalist who 
covers agricultural issues. 
</P>
<P>
As he mourns his missing hand, Catlett discovers healing strength in memories 
of his farmer ancestors and their ties to the earth, and in the example of a 
modest Amish farmer who is content with his small farm and honest labor. 
Wendell Berry contrasts modern American agribusiness -- which he depicts as an 
artificial conglomeration of sterile flow charts, debts and mechanization -- 
with the older ideal of farming as a nurturing way of life. Like the wise Turk 
in "Candide," Berry maintains that working the land "keeps away the three great 
evils: boredom, vice and need," and he frames his arguements in a seductively 
evocative, almost misty prose.

pursue their separate but linked destinies. Grace opts for a steady domesticity 
that is simultaneously reassuring and confining, while Caroline pursues 
romance, risking security for more intense passion. Hazzard's intriguing 
characters move like the clockwork components of an orerry through a series of 
surprising yet logical revelations.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: IN SOUTHERN LIGHT TREKKING THROUGH ZAIRE AND THE AMAZON BY

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two short, unrelated travelogues by the author of "African Madness." "In the 
Realm of the Amazons" takes Alex Shoumatoff to the banks of the Trombetas River 
in northeastern Brazil, to seek the source of the legends of female warriors 
that the early European explorers reported (which gave the Amazon its name) and 
the origin of the muiraquitas, jadelike amulets often associated with these 
tales. 
</P>
<P>
Shoumatoff finds numerous amulets and fragments of pottery, but no evidence of 
the Amazons: The legends appear to have been nothing more than stories the 
Spanish and Portuguese brought with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Across Zaire" offers a depressing portrait of the corruption and mismanagement 
that have reduced a potentially wealthy country to poverty and administrative 
near-chaos. Shoumatoff wanders through the northeastern jungles, near the 
borders of Sudan and Uganda, observing the local flora, fauna and peoples, 
including the Efe Pygmies. He writes knowledgeably and well about what he sees, 
especially the brilliantly colored jungle butterflies, but he never quite 
fulfills his stated objective: to explain the wanderlust that caused a woman to 
ask him, "Why do you keep going to these awful places?"

HUENEME PORT TO BE HOME OF OIL SPILL CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A CONSORTIUM PLANS TO SPEND $60 MILLION TO MAKE THE SITE THE FIRST 
OF FIVE REGIONAL FACILITIES CAPABLE OF CLEANING UP A MAJOR LEAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The deep-water Port of Hueneme, long overshadowed by other commercial shipping 
ports, is poised to become one of the nation's leading centers for the cleanup 
of major oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
A consortium of big oil companies plans to pour $60 million into the Port of 
Hueneme to make it the first of five regional centers capable of handling a 
216,000-barrel oil spill, about the amount that leaked from the Exxon Valdez in 
Alaska last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The Port of Hueneme center will be the first to come on line, and it will be a 
training facility for the rest of the country," said Skip Onstad, the newly 
appointed general manager of the Pacific Southwest Regional Response Center. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the economic boost to the port, the regional response center 
provides an extra layer of protection for the Ventura County and Santa Barbara 
County coastlines, which have a majority of California's offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Any spills in the area from offshore oil rigs or tankers now would be handled 
by ships and equipment of Clean Seas, an oil cleanup cooperative. Based in 
Carpinteria, the cleanup team was formed by area oil companies after the 1969 
Union Oil platform blowout off Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Placing the regional response center in Port Hueneme would greatly bolster the 
area's fleet of oil cleanup vessels, equipment and personnel needed in the 
event of a catastrophic spill, industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly should enhance the ability to handle emergencies, such as a 
calamity in the Santa Barbara Channel," said Dorill B. Wright, mayor of the 
city of Port Hueneme and a California coastal commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"With the Mideast crisis, more oil exploration will probably take place in the 
Santa Barbara Channel," said Edward J. Millan, president of the Port of 
Hueneme's harbor commissioners. "We hope an accident never happens, but if it 
does, it is good to have the capability of this magnitude close by." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the industry effort, critics are skeptical about handling moderate 
spills, not to mention one as large as the 11 million gallons of crude oil that 
poured from the Exxon Valdez into Alaska's Prince William Sound in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Baird, the California Coastal Commission's oil spill cleanup specialist, 
said he is pleased that the industry is making an effort. But he said today's 
technology is too primitive to prevent a large spill from fouling the shore. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have to clean it up when it hits the beach," Baird said. "But, 
hopefully, we will be able to keep more oil off the beach." 
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons for selecting the Port of Hueneme is its proximity to 
oil drilling in the Santa Barbara Channel, said John Dowling, a Chevron U.S.A. 
official involved in the site selection. The port also has the advantage of 
being next to two naval bases that could lend support, such as airlifting 
people and equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Port of Hueneme is less congested than other deep-water ports 
of Los Angeles and Long Beach -- contenders in the yearlong search for a site. 
</P>
<P>
"The Port of Hueneme does not have all of the hustle and bustle that is around 
Los Angeles and Long Beach," Wright said. "It's minutes from the harbor to the 
high seas, where it may take a few hours to get through the harbor in Long 
Beach." 
</P>
<P>
The regional center at the Port of Hueneme is one of five proposed centers that 
would be run by the Marine Spill Response Corp., a new nonprofit organization 
established by 20 major oil companies and shippers. 
</P>
<P>
The corporation plans to spend $800 million over the next five years to develop 
around-the-clock response teams. The program is designed to fill a need 
outlined last year by an oil industry study, which said that "neither the 
government nor the industry has the equipment or personnel in place and ready 
to deal with catastrophic spills." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle will have the only other regional center on the West Coast. The other 
three will be at Lake Charles, La., New York and Port Everglades, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
All five centers are expected to be operational within the next 2 1/2 years. 
The Port of Hueneme center may come on line within 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the other centers, the Port of Hueneme already has available warehouse 
space, offices, berths and other structures needed for a regional center, 
Dowling said. 
</P>
<P>
Dowling and Onstad entered into negotiations last week with Port of Hueneme 
officials over the price of leasing a 92,000-square-foot building, three acres 
of staging area and berths for several vessels. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony J. Taormina, the port's executive director, declined to discuss the 
negotiations. "All I can say is we don't have a contract yet." 
</P>
<P>
But Dowling said he sees no problems in reaching an agreement with port 
authorities. "I've been told to close the deal by the end of the month," 
Dowling said. "We want Port Hueneme to be up and running and fly the colors for 
the organization." 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Spill Response Corp. plans to place $27.4 million worth of equipment 
at the port, including a 200-foot oil recovery vessel and at least one barge 
capable of storing 20,000 to 50,000 barrels of recovered oil. 
</P>
<P>
The center also would have a variety of smaller boats, equipment to skim oil 
off the surface of water, floating booms to contain spills, beach protection 
equipment and a stockpile of chemicals to disperse oil. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller amounts of equipment would be stored at other locations within the 
Pacific Southwest region, including the ports of San Francisco, Los 
Angeles/Long Beach, San Diego and Oahu, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Once operational, the center at Port Hueneme would employ about 60 people, with 
rotating crews prepared to depart at any hour. It is unclear how many others 
would be employed to handle training for the centers in other regions. 
</P>
<P>
"The equipment in the region will give us a major start in combating a spill 
the size of the Exxon Valdez," Onstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Until accepting his new position, Onstad had been manager of Clean Seas, the 
local oil spill cleanup cooperative that has three large oil recovery vessels 
and equipment stored in various places to cover spills off of Ventura, Santa 
Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
Onstad said Clean Seas will remain an independent organization with the primary 
responsibility of handling smaller spills. "Clean Seas is the largest and 
best-equipped of the co-ops in the country," he said. "It can handle a spill of 
large significance."

GANGS IN SUBURBIA; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: WITH A LOW CRIME RATE AND HIGH AVERAGE INCOME, THE CITY SEEMS AN 
UNLIKELY PLACE FOR YOUTH GANGS SUCH AS THE HOUSTON HOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an old, run-down house off Thousand Oaks Boulevard near the Ventura Freeway, 
the Houston Hoods have set up their headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the night, they gather around a bonfire in the front yard, drink 
beer and listen to rap music. Sometimes they "go looking for trouble," one 
said, and sometimes trouble finds them. 
</P>
<P>
Although many Thousand Oaks residents might not notice the graffiti scrawled on 
neighborhood walls, the gang is well-known among Ventura County sheriff's 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
And there are others. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, various gangs have cropped up throughout the city. 
Thousand Oaks seems like a strange place to find gangs, officials admit. The 
average household income is about $45,000, and the average home costs about 
$290,000. In addition, the area has one of the lowest crime rates in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, police say, is peer pressure. In fact, gang membership may 
be the latest fad. 
</P>
<P>
"They hear about the L.A. gangs, and they think, 'That's neat,' " said Deputy 
Paul Higgason of the Thousand Oaks gang squad. "Now it's just very fashionable 
to be in a gang." 
</P>
<P>
Fad or not, police say they take these groups seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, there have been four gang-related drive-by shootings in Thousand 
Oaks, according to police, although no one has been injured. Fifteen teen-agers 
and young adults -- at least two of them members of the Houston Hoods -- have 
been arrested on suspicion of scrawling graffiti across public buildings and 
walls. Several others have been accused of felony assault. 
</P>
<P>
So far, about 30 "core gang" members, most of them teen-agers, have been 
identified in Thousand Oaks. At least 40 others have been listed by police as 
gang "associates," people who hang out with gang members. And there are as many 
as 130 affiliates or gang-member wanna-bes. Many are still in high school. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Houston Hoods, the two other recognized gangs in Thousand 
Oaks are the Small Town Hoods and TOCAS, which stands for Thousand Oaks 
California Sur. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the dangerous Los Angeles gangs, they are not suspected of selling 
drugs. Nor have the Thousand Oaks gangs reached the "turf war" stage, and 
police want to make sure they don't. 
</P>
<P>
Higgason said he and his partner, Deputy Randy Pentis, cruise Thousand Oaks 
almost every night looking for the groups and questioning gang members. Since 
they have stepped up their efforts, police say they have kept the problem under 
control -- but they wonder how long their luck will hold. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to get worse before it gets better," Higgason said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Houston Hoods have scrawled gang symbols on the ceilings and 
walls of the building they call the "Hood Shack," an aging house that's been 
condemned and is scheduled to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the members wear shirts and black caps sporting their gang name and 
symbols. They go by nicknames: Sharky, Bambam, Clumsy, Fantom and Daddy. None 
would identify themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The group might turn some heads at The Oaks Mall or the local bowling alley. 
But they usually stay away from public places for fear of running into the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
One member likes to show off his gun but is quick to point out that it is 
unloaded. "We're not violent," he said. "But we'll protect ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Although they talk tough, their rhetoric sometimes sounds as if they're the 
winning high school football team. 
</P>
<P>
"We're No. 1," one member boasted. 
</P>
<P>
Another member said: "We don't have automatic weapons like the L.A. gangs. We 
don't deal drugs. We just hang out and party." 
</P>
<P>
They emerge occasionally from the Hood Shack to scrawl graffiti on a nearby 
neighborhood wall, which the city repaints the next day. The wall is now 
striped with different colors of paint. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the residents in the area say they are frightened to go out at night. 
</P>
<P>
"They're up and down this street nonstop," said one resident, who asked not to 
be identified for fear of reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident added: "It breaks my heart to see the gangs. You would never 
think something like this would exist in Thousand Oaks, but it does. I guess 
it's everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
One way the Thousand Oaks gangs differ from their Los Angeles counterparts is 
in their ethnic and economic diversity, police say. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of the gangs started with only Latinos but eventually expanded to 
include all ethnic backgrounds. Another started as a white-supremacist group 
but now includes all races. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Houston Hoods say they have always included members from all 
backgrounds. "It's not about race," one member said. "It's about brotherhood." 
</P>
<P>
The gang started on Houston Drive and then branched out to other areas of the 
city. Most of the members have attended Westlake High School. 
</P>
<P>
Some come from rich families, others from poor. "You should see where some of 
these kids live," Higgason says. "Some have real affluent families." 
</P>
<P>
So why do they join gangs? For a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're bored," said a 13-year-old member, wearing a black Los Angeles Raiders 
cap over his blond hair. "There's just nothing to do in this town." 
</P>
<P>
According to another gang member, whose father is a lawyer, "It's the family 
some of us never had." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like having a bunch of brothers," another said. "We would do anything for 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Larry Horner said city officials noticed the gangs about two years 
ago and began a graffiti-removal program. He said local officials have been 
working closely with the Sheriff's Department to eradicate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just a bunch of thrill seekers," Horner said of the gang members. 
"They're not welcome here, and we'll continue to make things uncomfortable for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some gang members said they are here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a neighborhood gang," one member said. "And Thousand Oaks is our 
neighborhood."

TALL SHIPS BRING PAST INTO PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The tall ships met at sea just beyond Channel Islands Harbor -- one carrying 
jewelers masquerading as pirates, the other a crew of retired aerospace 
engineers and elementary school teachers working for pleasure on a replica of a 
19th-Century cargo ship. 
</P>
<P>
In 1834, the gunpowder shots fired from each boat's cannons would have warned 
of raids. But Saturday morning, the echoing booms merely startled flocks of 
pelicans and neighboring boaters. 
</P>
<P>
The shots were meant to welcome the Pilgrim to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
A replica of the ship described by Richard Henry Dana in the classic "Two Years 
Before the Mast," the 96-foot Pilgrim will spend this weekend at the harbor for 
tours and a theatrical re-enactment of Dana's life aboard the brig. 
</P>
<P>
"This ship represents to Southern California what the Mayflower represents to 
New England," said Stanley L. Cummings, executive director of the Orange County 
Marine Institute, which moors the ship at Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County institute strives to preserve old-time sailing skills, 
Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Ventura County Maritime Museum opens in three months, its directors 
hope to attract other tall ships and displays of historical nautical items to 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of thing that we'll be doing frequently," said Frank Crane, 
the museum's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, a nonprofit corporation, will feature educational programs and 
events associated with the area's nautical heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The Witch of Wood, a gaff-rigged topsail schooner and replica of a 
Revolutionary War privateer, escorted the Pilgrim into the harbor Saturday 
about 11 a.m. The Witch's captain and builder, Stan Pietrucki, sported a waxed 
mustache and was dressed in a green velvet jacket. He and Marianne McGovern 
wore large gold earrings and their three-person crew also dressed as pirates. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going in for rape and pillage," Pietrucki, a custom jeweler from 
Northern California, joked as the two ships neared one another. 
</P>
<P>
The Witch also will be open for tours from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. today through 
Thursday. Performances aboard the Pilgrim will be held at 6:30 and 9 p.m. 
Sunday. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

6 MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS SUE CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six mobile home park owners in Oxnard have filed lawsuits against the city, 
claiming that its rent control policies place unfair restrictions on park 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
Robert S. Coldren, a Santa Ana attorney representing the park owners, said the 
suit filed Wednesday in Ventura County Superior Court will seek "millions of 
dollars in damages" and will try to eliminate Oxnard's rent control laws. 
</P>
<P>
Coldren said Oxnard's rent control policy is unfair because it provides tenants 
with a perpetual lease while placing limits on the rents charged by park 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
The law also allows tenants to take advantage of the low rents by selling the 
homes at an inflated price but prohibits park owners from raising rents when a 
new tenant moves in, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the law allows tenants to profit from the low rents but provides no 
profits for the park owner, Coldren said. 
</P>
<P>
Coldren said similar lawsuits have been won against the cities of Los Angeles 
and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Gary L. Gillig said the rent control laws in Oxnard are not 
identical to those in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it is a matter of concern, but since our laws are different from those 
others, what happened in those cities won't necessarily happen here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Karrin, a mobile-home activist and candidate for City Council, criticized 
the lawsuits, saying park owners already profit a great deal. "Park owners are 
making so much money it's not even funny," he said. HUGO MARTIN

MORNING BRIEFING: SOMETIMES, BEING A 'HOMER' MEANS GIVING UP YOUR SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Munson, who calls the radio play-by-play for University of Georgia 
football games, told Raad Cawthon of the Atlanta Journal he thinks of himself 
as "a bit of a homer." 
</P>
<P>
One of Munson's memorable calls came during the Bulldogs' game with Florida in 
1980. Georgia trailed, 21-20, with 1:30 remaining, facing third-and-11 from its 
seven-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Said Munson: "(Quarterback) Buck (Belue) back, third down on the 8 (sic). In 
trouble. Got a block behind him. Gonna throw on the run. 
</P>
<P>
"Complete to the 25! To the 30! Lindsay Scott, 35, 40! Lindsay Scott, 45, 50, 
45, 40! Run, Lindsay! 25! 20! 15! 10! Five! Lindsay Scott! Lindsay Scott! 
Lindsay Scott! (Crowd noise for 41 seconds). . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it. I broke my chair. A metal, steel chair with about a 
five-inch cushion. Well, the stadium fell down. . . . I didn't mean to beg 
Lindsay to run, but I had to." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: In 1977, the Rams drafted a running back out of Carthage College, 
the first player from the school ever chosen by a pro football team. Who was 
he? 
</P>
<P>
Golden goofer: From Patrick Reusse of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, in a column 
on embattled University of Minnesota Coach John Gutekunst: 
</P>
<P>
"Gutekunst has pointed out he is the second coach in Gophers history to have a 
winning record in three of his first four seasons. The other guy was Bernie 
Bierman. The Grey Eagle's record from 1932 through 1935 was 25-3-4. Gutekunst's 
four-year record is 21-23-2 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Gutey seriously wants us to declare him the second coming of 
Bierman." 
</P>
<P>
The right call: After Virginia beat Kansas Sept. 1, Cavalier center Billy Curry 
got on the team bus and put on his radio headphones. 
</P>
<P>
He heard the announcer say that Kentucky, in its first game under Curry's 
father, Bill, had lost to Central Michigan, 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
The score was reversed, but Billy didn't get the news until he talked with his 
father by phone six hours later. 
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky coach told Pat Forde of the Louisville Courier-Journal: "I said, 
'We had to come from behind. We didn't look very good at all, but we won.' 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'What, you won?' 
</P>
<P>
"He started screaming, threw the phone down and was yelling at his roommates 
and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Add Curry: He described his wife, daughter and son as being "hyper" about the 
family's football involvement, adding: "One of my ambitions is to get so my 
family doesn't act so wild." 
</P>
<P>
A perfect game: From Boston Globe columnist Bob Ryan, writing about a recent 
matchup between the Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics: "Last night's (Roger) 
Clemens -- (Dave) Stewart matchup was big, but from reading the papers, I'm 
telling you that Walter Johnson vs. Smokey Joe Wood 78 years ago was even 
bigger. And there were no beach balls." 
</P>
<P>
Eight men out: In a recent story on fantasy football leagues, Tim Cowlishaw of 
the Dallas Morning News recalled that last season, eight fantasy players were 
arrested for "engaging in organized crime" at Scholz's Beer Garten in Austin, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The "Fantasy Eight" spent a night in jail, then waited for several months for 
the wheels of justice to turn. 
</P>
<P>
Said Chris Hosek, manager of Scholz's: "We heard it was going to the grand jury 
in March, but it never did." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder. Byron (Bubba) Cates, head of the Austin vice squad at the time of 
the bust, was fired in May for "using excessive force" and has since been 
indicted on two federal racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Jim Jodat. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Rookie free agent Amod Field, leaving the Phoenix Cardinals' 
training camp with a garbage bag full of his belongings slung over his 
shoulder: "How do they expect me to go to the Pro Bowl if they cut me today?"

MARINERS KNOCK ABBOTT OFF COURSE, 7-2; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AFTER GOING THREE STARTS WITHOUT A LOSS FOR THE ANGELS, HE GIVES UP 
12 HITS IN 5 1/3 INNINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
He gave up 12 hits and five earned runs in 5 1/3 innings, but Jim Abbott did 
his job Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Reynolds and the Mariners simply did theirs better, piecing together a 
collection of broken-bat hits that vanquished Abbott's hopes of putting 
together his first string of successes this season and sent the Angels to a 7-2 
loss at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"The art of pitching is to make people mis-hit balls and he did that," Angel 
Manager Doug Rader said of Abbott (10-13), who had won twice and gotten one 
no-decision in his previous three outings. "They just found the holes. The way 
he threw the baseball, there wasn't anything wrong with it." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds found the right target: the left side. He reached base in each of his 
first four at-bats and scored a run each time, triggering enough offense to 
support the six-hit pitching of Erik Hanson (15-9) and end the Angels' 
five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds reached base in the first inning on a line drive that third baseman 
Jack Howell knocked down but couldn't play, reached second base in the second 
when his grounder rolled under Howell's glove for an error, doubled down the 
left-field line past a lunging Howell during a two-run fourth and grounded a 
single between Howell and shortstop Dick Schofield to start the two-run sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't keep Reynolds off the bases," Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre said 
after his club's four-game losing streak ended. "He's just been getting some 
big hits." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott acknowledged that he "got a little out of sync" in the fourth, when he 
balked with Reynolds on second and then gave up a broken-bat single to short 
left field by Henry Cotto and was victimized by Jeffrey Leonard's run-scoring 
infield hit. But Abbott refused to be shaken by the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave up 12 hits, but I don't think I did that poorly," said Abbott, who tied 
Bert Blyleven for most hits given up by an Angel starter this season. Blyleven 
yielded 12 to the Chicago White Sox June 26. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to make excuses," Abbott said. "I'm not going to say I was 
dominating and they squeaked by. But I'm not upset with the amount of hits I 
gave up or have given up. I'm not going to play the martyr. I don't think they 
hit the ball that hard." 
</P>
<P>
From start to early finish, Abbott was shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Even that last inning there were two ground balls (by Reynolds and Edgar 
Martinez) and Jackie (Howell) and Schoey came as hard as they could and it just 
gets between them," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
"I pretty much threw the ball where I wanted to. The balls had a way of being 
in holes tonight. My last time out (a 3-1 victory over Minnesota last Monday), 
they hit them at somebody. I guess I need to be a little more precise 
location-wise. 
</P>
<P>
"That much of a difference made up for what happened," Abbott said, holding his 
thumb and forefinger an inch or so apart. "I felt like I threw the pitches 
where I wanted to. I didn't have my best stuff, but a lot of things went their 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Not much went the Angels' way against Hanson, who struck out six and became 
only the fifth Seattle pitcher to win 15 games in a season. He yielded a 
run-scoring double to Howell in the second and a home run to Dave Winfield in 
the sixth, Winfield's 19th homer of the season and third in two nights. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have much to say," Winfield said. "They beat us. They just beat us." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schofield entered Saturday's game with a season-high .255 batting average, 
well above his career .231 average and four points higher than his 1987 
career-best .251. Schofield hit .176 (24 for 136) in his first 43 games and 
.345 (41 for 119) in his next 40. 
</P>
<P>
"He's widened his stance and got himself a bigger bat," hitting instructor 
Deron Johnson said. "He's hitting the ball all over, using the whole field. 
He's had some quality at-bats the last couple of games." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield, who was hitless in 19 at-bats against Seattle this season before 
hitting two homers Friday, will be glad when the Angels finish with the 
Mariners. "If it weren't for Seattle and Cleveland, I'd be hitting .300," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. Winfield was 12 for 53 (.226) against the Indians and was two for 22 
against the Mariners through Friday. Subtracting those teams from his overall 
stats would put him at .277 instead of his actual .261 average. . . . 
Winfield's two homers Friday and one Saturday gave him 376 for his career and 
moved him within three of the Boston Red Sox's Dwight Evans for the lead among 
active players. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Parrish, hitless in four at-bats Friday and six for 40 in his last 12 
games, had the night off. John Orton, recalled from triple-A Edmonton Thursday, 
started at catcher for the first time since July 1. . . . Donnie Hill, still 
recovering from a sprained left wrist, took batting practice Saturday for the 
first time since his injury. . . . Max Venable, who suffered a sprained right 
ankle Tuesday, could be available today.

</P>
<P>
COUGARS: AFTER SPOTTING WASHINGTON STATE A 29-7 LEAD, THE QUARTERBACK'S FOUR 
SECOND-HALF TOUCHDOWN PASSES LEAD TO A 50-36 VICTORY.

<P>
One week after upsetting top-ranked Miami, the Brigham Young Cougars appeared 
to be on the way to suffering an upset of their own. 
</P>
<P>
BYU trailed Washington State, 29-7, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them it didn't matter if we won or lost at halftime," BYU Coach LaVell 
Edwards said of his locker-room speech, "but that the last 30 minutes would set 
the tone for what the rest of the season would be." 
</P>
<P>
So quarterback Ty Detmer threw four second-half touchdown passes, and BYU 
turned an upset into a 50-36 victory, improving its record to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
On the first series of the second half, Detmer completed a two-yard pass to 
Nati Vande to pull BYU within 29-14. Detmer, who threw five touchdown passes, 
hit three of them in a school-record 36-point fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We got fired up and got hot," said Detmer, who completed 32 of 50 passes for 
448 yards, with two interceptions. "There are not many teams in the country 
that can score 43 points in a half." 
</P>
<P>
Washington State Coach Mike Price couldn't argue. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had a chance going in at halftime like we did," Price said. 
"(But) you put Ty Detmer and that offense on the field and they are going to 
score. . . . They just out-executed us." 
</P>
<P>
Washington State (1-2) still held a 15-point lead going into the final quarter 
against the defending Western Athletic Conference champions. 
</P>
<P>
But Detmer hit two quick touchdown passes -- a 16-yarder to Brent Nyberg, along 
with a two-point pass to Chris Smith, and a 32-yarder to Andy Boyce, pulling 
BYU into a 29-29 tie. 
</P>
<P>
After Washington State punted from its 28, Detmer engineered an 84-yard, 
13-play scoring drive that ended with a nine-yard pass play to Stacey Corley. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State tied the score for the last time, 36-36, on an 80-yard, 
five-play series, highlighted by Brad Gossen's 51-yard pass play to Ron Young 
and a seven-yard touchdown catch by Calvin Griggs. 
</P>
<P>
But Detmer came right back, hitting Boyce for 15 yards and a first down at 
midfield, then handing off to Peter Tuipulotu for a 30-yard gain. The next 
play, Tuipulotu ran 23 yards for the go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Gossen, unable to find a receiver on fourth and nine with 2:19 left, was sacked 
at the Washington State 13. Three plays later, Corley scored on a four-yard run 
to finish BYU's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Gossen finished with 323 yards, hitting 25 of 42 passes. Wright-Fair ran for 
125 yards and one touchdown on 21 carries.

<P>
Craig Erickson completed 32 of 47 passes for 467 yards and four touchdowns to 
lead the Miami Hurricanes to a 52-24 victory over California Saturday at 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (1-1), coming off a 28-21 loss to BYU, lost four fumbles to Cal, had a 
field-goal attempt blocked and allowed Cal's Russell White to return a kickoff 
99 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the miscues, Miami piled up 599 yards on offense and set a team 
record for passing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Cal was within a touchdown, 31-24, with less than a quarter to play. 
</P>
<P>
Cal quarterback Mike Pawlawski, who completed 28 of 43 passes for 245 yards and 
a touchdown, said of Miami: "There are better teams that don't talk as much, 
and they're awful dancers (after touchdowns). They talk a lot tougher than they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Wesley Carroll, Randy Bethel, Randal Hill and Leonard Conley each caught 
touchdown passes for the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
Miami still needed a fourth-quarter defensive stand and a muffed snap on a 
California punt before finally putting away the Golden Bears (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Miami, leading 31-21, forced Cal to settle for Robbie Keene's 25-yard field 
goal with 12:58 left in the game after the Golden Bears had first and goal at 
the three. 
</P>
<P>
Cal's next possession ended with Keene dropping the snap on a punt attempt at 
the Bears' one. Steve McGuire scored on the next play to give Miami a 38-24 
lead. The Hurricanes added Conley's touchdown reception and Darryl Spencer's 
38-yard run after a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Erickson completed 13 consecutive passes and was 23 of 32 
for 370 yards. He drove the Hurricanes to touchdowns after each of California's 
first-half scores. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Erickson racked up the second-highest total for passing yards in a game 
by a Miami quarterback, outdistanced only by Gino Torretta's 468 yards against 
San Jose State last year. Erickson's halftime total would have ranked seventh 
on the same list. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon 55, Idaho 23 -- This victory at Eugene, Ore., might have been the 
costliest blowout in Oregon football history. 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks lost star receiver Tony Hargain and starting fullback Brandon Jumper 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Hargain, Oregon's big-play threat who caught 10 passes for 206 yards in the 
Ducks' season-opening victory over San Diego State, suffered a fractured left 
kneecap in the first quarter in what Coach Rich Brooks called "one of the 
freakiest things I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
The Oregon senior leaped into the air trying to snag a pass from Bill Musgrave, 
then tumbled to the turf on his back. There was no contact on the play. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't hit. He didn't land on it. He just jumped and tore it apart," Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hargain is expected to undergo surgery today. 
</P>
<P>
Jumper's injury was especially upsetting to Brooks. The big fullback had run 
out of bounds at the end of a 43-yard gain when he was pushed from behind by 
Idaho's Kris McCall. Jumper tried to avoid a training table and tore ligaments 
in his right knee. He said he probably would undergo surgery next week. 
</P>
<P>
McCall was called for a personal foul and ejected from the game because of the 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Backup fullback Juan Shedrick also missed much of the contest with an ankle 
injury and is questionable for next weekend's game. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon (2-0) rushed for 398 yards, just five short of the school record. 
Tailbacks Ngalu Kelemeni and Sean Burwell led the way with 149 and 126 yards, 
respectively. It was the Ducks' highest-scoring game since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas 45, Oregon State 20 -- This could be a long season for the 
Beavers, who are 0-3. Oregon State led, 14-12, at halftime, but fumbled the 
ball away on its first six possessions in the second half, and the Rebels 
turned five of the miscues into scores. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers previously lost to Montana, 22-15, and Kansas, 38-12. 
</P>
<P>
For UNLV, the victory at Corvallis, Ore., was the first under its new coach, 
Jim Strong. The Rebels had lost to Southwestern Missouri State, 31-24, and 
Houston, 37-9. 
</P>
<P>
Kennan McCardell caught three touchdown passes and Marvin Eastman ran for a 
pair of scores to lead the Rebels, who won on the road for the first time since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
No. 20 Arizona 25, New Mexico 10 -- The Lobos weren't pushovers for the 
Wildcats at Albuquerque, leading, 7-5, at halftime and trailing only 12-10 late 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona quarterback Ronald Veal broke open the game with two one-yard scoring 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona improved to 2-0; New Mexico fell to 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico led at halftime on an 18-yard scoring pass from Jeremy Leach to 
freshman Carl Winston, but the Lobos managed only a 27-yard field goal by David 
Margolis in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Leach, who had thrown 157 passes without an interception, was picked off three 
times, and he was sacked four times. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats, who got a safety in the second quarter when Mike Parker tackled 
New Mexico halfback Andre Wooten in the end zone, drove 44 yards and 21 yards 
for Veal's two touchdowns. The second Veal touchdown was set up by a Reggie 
Johnson's recovery of a Leach fumble. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Arizona State 31, Colorado State 20 -- Paul Justin threw for 274 yards 
and two touchdowns and safety Nathan LaDuke returned an interception 92 yards 
for another score as the Sun Devils (2-0) won at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Devils are 19-1 in the 40-year-old series against the Rams, including a 
15-0 record in Tempe. Colorado State (2-1) hasn't beaten Arizona State since a 
25-14 victory achieved during a blizzard at Ft. Collins in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, trailing 15-7 at halftime, trailed only 21-14 after Tony Alford's 
two-yard touchdown run with 2:53 remaining in the third quarter.

<P>
Jim Taylor, a hero a week ago, missed 42-yard field-goal attempt with 54 
seconds remaining as Southern Mississippi failed in its bid for a second 
consecutive upset Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's attempt hit the right upright and bounced away, taking with it a 
chance at upsetting Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
With the Bulldogs' Larry Ware scoring two second-half touchdowns, Georgia (1-1) 
beat the Golden Eagles, 18-17. 
</P>
<P>
The victory ended a four-game Georgia losing streak, dating to last season. 
Southern Mississippi dropped to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Southern Mississippi upset Alabama, 27-24, on a 52-yard field goal 
by Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the Golden Eagles built a 17-6 lead before Ware, a junior, scored on 
a 20-yard run to finish a 68-yard drive in the third quarter. He followed that 
with a five-yard run with 6:04 left in the game, giving the Bulldogs the 18-17 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia missed two-point conversion passes, but got two 38-yard field goals 
from John Kasay. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Favre gave Southern Mississippi a 10-3 lead midway through the second 
quarter when he hit Dwayne Nelson on a nine-yard pass after Terryl Ulmer had 
recovered Andre Hastings' fumble on a kickoff at the Georgia 11. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 10-6, Favre and Michael Jackson hooked up on a 68-yard touchdown 
pass play to make it 17-10.

FLORIDA EXTENDS ALABAMA'S STREAK, 17-13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will White looked into the eyes of Alabama quarterback Gary Hollingsworth, and 
what he saw there helped No. 24 Florida extend Alabama's longest losing streak 
in 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
White intercepted three Hollingsworth passes and Richard Fain covered a blocked 
punt for the winning touchdown as Florida defeated the Crimson Tide, 17-13, 
Saturday in a Southeastern Conference game at Tuscaloosa, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
It was Alabama's fourth consecutive loss, and its second this season under new 
coach Gene Stallings. Hollingsworth also had three passes intercepted in 
Alabama's 24-21 loss to Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
"All week long we studied how Hollingsworth looks at his receivers before he 
throws," White said. "He holds it really long, and by reading his eyes and 
knowing where the receiver was, I made the picks." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Spencer blocked an Alabama punt on the second play of the final quarter, 
and Fain recovered in the end zone to give Florida a 17-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Florida (2-0), overcoming a 10-point deficit, gave its new coach, Steve 
Spurrier, his first SEC victory. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings said he thought the Crimson Tide played much better than a week ago, 
"but the bottom line is we still lost the game." 
</P>
<P>
Florida sophomore quarterback Shane Matthews completed 21 of 37 passes for 267 
yards and a touchdown -- a six-yarder to Terrence Barber that came after 
Alabama had taken a 10-0 lead on Hollingsworth's 15-yard pass to Craig 
Sanderson and Philip Doyle's 41-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Auburn 24, Mississippi 10 -- The Tigers produced 367 yards of offense, 
but couldn't put away Ole Miss until Dennis Wallace returned an intercepted 
pass 36 yards for a touchdown with 24 seconds left in a SEC opener at Jackson, 
Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn (2-0) trailed, 10-9, in the third quarter when freshman quarterback Stan 
White led the Tigers on a 59-yard scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
James Joseph gained 35 yards in three carries during the drive that ended when 
White connected with Greg Taylor on a 26-yard scoring play with 8:52 left in 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers added a two-point conversion for a 17-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi drove to the Auburn 11 with 5 1/2 minutes remaining, but an illegal 
procedure call and a 16-yard sack by Walter Tate led to a failed 46-yard 
field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Ole Miss (1-1) had two other late possessions, the first ending on downs and 
the other when Wallace made the clinching interception. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they had the tools and ability to come back," White said. "They did 
and they fought hard." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph led Auburn's rushing attack with 119 yards in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
White completed 16 of 31 passes for 208 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got a pretty good chance to be a decent team before it's over," 
said Auburn Coach Pat Dye, whose team limited Mississippi to 114 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn, after its fourth straight SEC title, led 9-0 after the first two series 
of the game before a crowd of 41,500. 
</P>
<P>
Led by White's passing, the Tigers rolled 62 yards in eight plays after the 
kickoff. White completed three of four passes for 38 yards and Joseph ran the 
final five yards for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi's first three plays from scrimmage lost 13 yards and on fourth down 
Charles Childers' punt was batted out of the end zone by Bennie Pierce for a 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi got rolling late in the second quarter behind No. 2 quarterback Tom 
Luke, who drove the Rebels to the Auburn six but then was taken out after 
suffering a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Russ Shows threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Camp Roberts 
to complete the 75-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
LSU 35, Miami (Ohio) 7 -- Harvey Williams tied a school record by running for 
four touchdowns as the Tigers routed the Redskins at Baton Rogue, La. 
</P>
<P>
The LSU record was set in 1977 by Charles Alexander against Oregon and also 
tied in 1984 by Dalton Hilliard against Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
LSU is 2-0; Miami 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' touchdowns were from five yards and four yards in the second quarter, 
and from four yards and three yards in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Second-string quarterback Chad Loup got LSU's other touchdown on a run from 
three yards out in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Tennessee 56, Texas El Paso 0 -- The Volunteers limited outmanned UTEP to 
148 total yards, including just 45 in 32 rushing attempts, in breezing to a 
victory at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
UTEP's Mike Perez was sacked five times and finished with minus 31 yards 
rushing. He completed 12 of 27 passes for 103 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tennessee offense ground out 510 yards. Thirteen players carried 
the ball at least once as Tennessee quit passing early in the second half and 
Johnny Majors cleared his bench.

TEXAS A&amp;M SETS RECORD WITH 774 TOTAL YARDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lance Pavlas completed all nine of his passes, three for touchdowns, and Texas 
A&amp;M set a school record for total offense with 774 yards in defeating 
Southwestern Louisiana, 63-14, Saturday night at College Station, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second-highest total in Southwest Conference history behind 
Houston's 1,021 yards against Southern Methodist last year. Robert Wilson, 
Darren Lewis and Randy Simmons each had 100-yard rushing performances for the 
Aggies (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
Pavlas threw touchdown passes of nine and 20 yards to Gary Oliver and 68 to 
Shane Garrett -- all in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
On the long touchdown, Pavlas executed a perfect fake to Lewis, who drew in the 
Ragin' Cajuns' defense while Pavlas retreated with the ball hidden on his hip. 
Garrett slipped unnoticed into the secondary, caught Pavlas' pass at the 22 and 
ran untouched for the score. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies scored on six consecutive first-half possessions after a fumble 
stopped their first drive at the Cajun six. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Arkansas 28, Tulsa 3 -- Quinn Grovey completed his first two passes for 
touchdown plays covering 48 and 57 yards as the 15th-ranked Razorbacks opened 
Jack Crowe's first season as coach with a victory at Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
The Razorbacks beat Tulsa for the 14th consecutive time. Crowe replaced Ken 
Hatfield in January after Hatfield took the Clemson job. 
</P>
<P>
Grovey's first pass came on the third play of the game and was caught by 
freshman Tracy Caldwell cutting across the field. Grovey's second touchdown 
pass came on the Razorbacks' next possession and was the 10th play of a 99-yard 
drive. Grovey rolled left and found Derek Russell in stride alone down the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
Tulane 43, SMU 7 -- Deron Smith threw three touchdown passes, and Tulane's 
defense stuffed Southern Methodist's run-and-shoot offense at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Smith's touchdown passes went to Melvin Ferdinand in a 23-point second 
quarter in which the Green Wave took control of the game. The third went to 
Steve Ballard midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Tulane is 2-1, SMU 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Smith completed 18 of 29 passes for 223 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Tulane's defense held SMU quarterback Mike Romo to 175 passing yards and also 
contained running backs Rongea Hill and Kevin Love.

CLEMSON, THOMAS BOUNCE BACK TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Thomas scored on a 98-yard kickoff return and also set up the winning 
touchdown with a 37-yard pass reception as Clemson defeated Maryland, 18-17, in 
an Atlantic Coast Conference game Saturday at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was seeking redemption. In Clemson's 20-7 loss to Virginia last week, he 
dropped a critical third-down pass. The Tigers were forced to punt, and 
Virginia returned the kick to set up the clinching score. 
</P>
<P>
"The burden was on me because we lost," Thomas said. "If I didn't drop it, they 
would have never had that big return. It was all my fault. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure feel a lot better this week." 
</P>
<P>
Clemson (2-1 overall, 1-1 in the ACC) has beaten Maryland (2-1, 0-1) four 
consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland took a 17-12 lead with 10:25 remaining on a 39-yard field goal by Dan 
DeArmas. 
</P>
<P>
On Clemson's next series, the Tigers faced third and seven from their 35 when 
Thomas caught a short pass from DeChane Cameron and sprinted to the Maryland 
28. Five plays later, Cameron hit Rudy Harris with an 11-yard pass for the 
winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Dexter Davis' second interception with 2:23 left assured the Tigers of victory. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Florida St. 48, Georgia Southern 6 -- Shannon Baker and Amp Lee each had 
two touchdowns and Terrell Buckley scored on a long punt return for the second 
consecutive week as the Seminoles extended their winning streak to 12 games 
with the victory at Tallahasse, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State (2-0) has not been defeated since a 34-23 loss to Clemson on 
Sept. 9, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Southern (1-2) was limited to just 19 yards rushing and 53 yards 
overall in the first half, their lowest total since the school reinstated 
football in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Lee sandwiched two short scoring runs around Brad Johnson's touchdown pass to 
Baker in the first half. Baker also caught a nine-yard touchdown pass from 
reserve quarterback Casey Weldon in the fourth quarter to close the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Buckley, a sophomore, scored on a 67-yard punt return in the fourth quarter, 
giving Florida State a 41-6 lead. He scored on a 63-yard return last week 
against East Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
No. 11 Virginia 56, Navy 14 -- Virginia quarterback Shawn Moore passed for four 
touchdowns and ran for a fifth before halftime as the Cavaliers rolled up 664 
yards while cruising to a nonconference victory over the Midshipmen at 
Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a senior, completed 13 of 22 passes for 250 yards and ran for 35 yards. 
He became the school's career total offense leader with 6,081 yards, breaking 
Scott Gardner's 15-year-old mark of 6,059. 
</P>
<P>
The Midshipmen (1-1) were down, 21-0, when they got their second first down. 
Navy had only 49 yards and three first downs by halftime, when it trailed 35-0. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina 48, Connecticut 21 -- Cookie Massey scored on an 87-yard 
interception return to highlight a 24-point first quarter as the Tar Heels won 
a nonconference game at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mack Brown, 2-20 in his two previous seasons at North Carolina, is 3-2 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut, a member of the Division I-AA Yankee Conference, fell to 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State 20, Wake Forest 15 -- Terry Jordan, who lost two fumbles 
and threw an interception in the first half, hit Reggie Lawrence on a 33-yard 
scoring play in the third quarter to help the Wolfpack win an ACC game at 
Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, a sophomore, was starting in place of junior Charles Davenport, who was 
sidelined with a bruised shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's touchdown pass to Lawrence, which gave the Wolfpack a 17-12 lead, came 
one play after his scoring pass to William Turner was called back because of a 
holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan completed 12 of 21 passes for 181 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's problems with ballhandling were part of an epidemic. The Wolfpack 
(2-1, 1-1) committed four turnovers in the first quarter and finished with 
five. 
</P>
<P>
The Demon Deacons (1-2, 0-1) picked up two points when Wolfpack punter Preston 
Poag watched a snap sail over his head and out of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech 24, East Carolina 23 -- Quarterback Will Furrer completed 14 of 
19 passes for 237 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Hokies (2-1) in a 
nonconference game at Greenville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
East Carolina (1-2) pulled to within 24-23 on a 31-yard touchdown run by David 
Daniels, but defensive end Jimmy Whitten blocked the extra-point try to keep 
the Hokies in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
William &amp; Mary 37, Villanova 14 -- Quarterback Chris Hakel ran for two 
touchdowns and passed for another as the Tribe won a nonconference game at 
Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Hakel completed 16 of 26 passes for 222 yards as William &amp; Mary evened its 
record at 1-1. Villanova (1-1) was held scoreless in the second half.

American Mike Plant took the lead in the start of the BOC Challenge 
single-handed around-the-world race in Newport, R.I., despite a minor collision 
with one of the other race boats, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Plant's boat, Duracell, and the Class II sloop, New Spirit of Ipswich, 
skippered by Englishman Josh Hall, bumped into each other as the 24 competitors 
were readying for the start of the race, said BOC spokesman Tony Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
The first leg of the race -- 6,800-miles to Cape Town, South Africa -- started 
as scheduled despite a torrential downpour that cleared just in time for the

DOUBLE QUICK IS DOUBLE TOUGH IN STAKES WIN 
</P>

Returning to the track where he scored his maiden victory in 1988, Double Quick 
passed the $500,000 mark in earnings with a wire-to-wire victory in the $53,200 
Phil D. Shepherd Stakes at Fairplex Park Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Showing a fondness for the tight turns on the 5/8-mile oval, Double Quick 
turned back Monfarid on the backside and had plenty left to hold off 
Gentleman's Honor in the 1 1/16-mile feature. Monfarid finished third, while 
3-5 favorite Shaynoor faded to sixth in the field of seven older runners. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to run his best races on the front end," said trainer Mel Stute. "But 
this (3 1/2 lengths) is the furthest he has ever won by. I don't know if it's 
because of this track or because the class is a little different." 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Adalberto Lopez was also excited about the win. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking to ride this horse for some time," he said. "Mel (Stute) told me 
that the horse had some early speed and just to get him to relax. At the 
3/8-pole, my horse just took off." 
</P>
<P>
Double Quick won $30,700 while increasing his lifetime earnings to $508,883. 
</P>
<P>
Double Quick provided Stute with his record-leading 33rd Fairplex Park stakes 
victory and his 101th lifetime in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Fairplex Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former thoroughbred sprint star Hilco Scamper collapsed and died of a ruptured 
heart after the third race Saturday. Competing against quarter horses in the 
$14,050 Call Caleb Stakes at 870 yards, Hilco Scamper finished second before 
collapsing on the clubhouse turn. In 1987, he won the National Sprint 
Championship at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
One patron correctly won Saturday's Pick-Six payoff of $83,180. Jockeys Martin 
Pedroza and Paul Atchison each won two races. A show-bet plunger lost $10,000 
here when Criminal Type finished sixth in the $500,000 Woodward Stakes that was 
simulcast from Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
Sassy Slew, coming off a sharp runnerup effort at Del Mar, is the likely 
favorite today in the $54,100 E.B. Johnston Stakes. For the second straight 
day, on-track attendance showed an increase over 1989 figures. Saturday's crowd 
of 15,520 was 90 more than the 1989 count. The total mutuel handle of 
$4,031,019 surpassed the $3,997.987 bet one year ago.

DROSSIN RUNS DOWN ANOTHER RECORD TO LEAD AGOURA TO TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: CHARGERS EDGE PALOS VERDES IN WOODBRIDGE INVITATIONAL GIRLS' 
RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Agoura High's Deena Drossin set a course record at the Woodbridge Invitational 
on Saturday in Irvine, her second record in two weeks, and the Charger girls' 
cross-country team ended a three-year drought against three-time defending 
state Division I champion Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin, a senior, timed 17 minutes 4 seconds on the three-mile course at 
Woodbridge High, eclipsing the old mark of 17:05 set in 1987 by Melissa Sutton 
of Newbury Park. One week earlier, Drossin shattered Fillmore standout Nikki 
Shaw's record in the Seaside Invitational in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"The last half-mile I was relaxing until my coach told me I could get the 
record," said Drossin, who was named girls' athlete of the meet. "I was really 
pushing it the last 250 yards." 
</P>
<P>
Agoura Coach Bill Duley prefers Drossin avoid aiming for records. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to go after the records," Duley said. "If they fall, they 
fall. This is not something we want to get caught up in from week to week." 
</P>
<P>
Behind Drossin's win and a sixth-place finish by Tiffany York (17:51), Agoura 
edged Palos Verdes, 61-62. Tustin (147) and Corona del Mar (162) placed third 
and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it counts more at the end of the season," Duley said. "But this is 
something we've been trying to do for three years." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, '88 and '89, the Chargers finished second to Palos Verdes in the state 
Division I meet. Duley and Palos Verdes Coach Joe Kelly hope to continue their 
rivalry at the state level. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new alignment for the Southern Section and state championships, 
Agoura and Palos Verdes have been placed in Divisions II and III, respectively, 
based on smaller enrollment. But both schools petitioned the California 
Interscholastic Federation state office before Friday's deadline for placement 
in Division I, for schools with more than 2,021 students. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura girls' team currently is ranked second in the nation and Palos 
Verdes is sixth, according to The Harrier magazine, a cross-country 
publication. "The good teams should compete with the big schools," Duley said. 
Agoura currently has 1,900 students and Palos Verdes 1,333. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake senior Jeannie Rothman timed 17:23 to finish second in the 
medium-schools race. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Wilson of Newbury Park clocked 15:28 in winning the small-schools junior 
race and Agoura's Ryan Wilson won the medium-schools sophomore race in 15:36.

MARINE'S SCORING TOSSES COMPLETE MOORPARK ROMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only problem with Del Marine's debut as Moorpark College quarterback is 
that it does not leave Marine much room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Marine, who didn't enter the game against East Los Angeles College on Saturday 
night until the fourth quarter, could have played more, but how could he have 
played better? He threw only two passes, both for touchdowns -- including a 
54-yard strike to his brother Pete on his first pass as a Raider -- and 
finished with 77 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
The two scoring passes provided the final touches to Moorpark's 38-3 
nonconference victory at East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark led only 10-3 at halftime but scored four touchdowns in a little more 
than 10 minutes at the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth 
to turn the game into a blowout. 
</P>
<P>
"We sputtered in the first half,' Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner said. 'We could 
have got stung. I was getting a little bit worried." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark running backs Freddie Bradley and Jamal Anderson finished with 123 and 
90 yards, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't go through the East L.A. defense like a hot knife through butter -- 
more like a sledgehammer through butter. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they both played very well," Bittner said. "I thought all our backs 
played well." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark finished with 260 yards on the ground and 151 through the air. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley scored Moorpark's first touchdown of the second half when he shrugged 
off the East L.A. defensive line on a three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark scored late in the third quarter when John Corcoran picked off a 
Santiago Alvarez pass in the right flat, returned it inside the East L.A. 
20-yard line then tossed a lateral to James Jolicoeur, who ran for the 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Marine's touchdown passes capped the scoring. Early in the fourth quarter, 
Marine hit Pete on an out-and-up with a tight spiral for a 54-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about it was that I hit my brother," Marine said. 
</P>
<P>
On Moorpark's next series, he threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to Matt Young. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez completed 23 of 46 passes for 154 yards but had a pass intercepted by 
Corcoran in the end zone in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark scored its first touchdown on its second possession of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Starting quarterback Kris Dutra rifled a high pass into the end zone, and wide 
receiver Curtis Marsh tipped it before cradling it for a 13-yard touchdown 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Petroski added a 25-yard field goal on Moorpark's next possession, but 
Moorpark was held scoreless for the remainder of the half.

CLU LACKS FINISHING POWER, 22-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the Cal Lutheran offense, that first touchdown of the season is kind of 
like the rabbit they use at dog races. It's out there in front of the Kingsmen, 
but they just can't seem to catch up to it. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive weekend, the CLU offense failed to score a 
touchdown. And, not surprisingly, the Kingsmen lost another nonconference game 
Saturday, this time to UC Santa Barbara, 22-6, in Cal Lutheran's home opener. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike last week -- when CLU managed just two first downs and 87 yards in 
offense while being blown out by Azusa Pacific -- there was a silver lining to 
the Santa Barbara defeat. This time, Cal Lutheran was able to move the football 
up and down the field, just not into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen (0-2) rushed for 209 yards and had the football nine more minutes 
than UCSB, finishing with 319 yards to 318 for the Gauchos (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
"We made a tremendous amount of progress. I see definite glimmers of hope," Cal 
Lutheran Coach Joe Harper said. "We weren't defeated by UCSB today, we were 
defeated by CLU. 
</P>
<P>
"If the enemy is us, maybe we have a few things to do." 
</P>
<P>
Like work on the pass defense. Gaucho quarterback Mike Curtius completed 16 of 
30 passes for 250 yards and two second-quarter touchdowns, a 52-yard scoring 
strike to Johnny Ace and a 11-yard touchdown toss to Matt Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Curtius connected with Ace again on a 62-yard touchdown pass late in the second 
period, but Santa Barbara was flagged for illegal procedure, nullifying the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see the flag and I ran down the field like a crazy man," Curtius 
said. "I felt like a fool." 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't have felt any worse than CLU punter Len Bradley, who watched a snap 
sail over his head in the second period and bounce out of the end zone for a 
safety, increasing UCSB's advantage to 8-3. The Gauchos had missed the 
point-after kick on their first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
CLU freshman quarterback Feliciano Ramirez, who suffered through a 
three-for-17, two-interception performance against Azusa Pacific, played much 
better Saturday, completing 11 of 25 for 110 yards. Linebacker Dominic Freking 
intercepted Ramirez's first pass, however, returning it 40 yards to the CLU 11 
to set up Ross Bauer's ensuing two-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big play," Santa Barbara Coach Rick Candaele said. "They were 
running the ball and running the ball, and the first time they throw it, we 
pick it (off)." 
</P>
<P>
Alex Papike accounted for all the CLU points, booting field goals of 27 and 41 
yards in the first and fourth quarters, respectively. The Kingsmen shunned 
field-goal attempts in favor of going for the end zone on two fourth-down plays 
inside the UCSB 10-yard line, but Ramirez threw incomplete on one occasion and 
was sacked on the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, we had something to prove today, we just didn't put the ball 
in the end zone," said CLU's Cassidy O'Sullivan, who led the team in rushing 
with 87 yards. "But we made great strides." 
</P>
<P>
Someday soon, those strides might even reach the end zone.

THE HIGH SCHOOLSWESTLAKE COACH DEVISED UNIQUE FLIGHT PATTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who says Jim Benkert had his head in the clouds when he devised Westlake 
High's bizarre double-forward pass play is absolutely correct. 
</P>
<P>
He was 30,000 feet up in the air at the time, on a flight to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a rule book and decided to read it on the flight," Benkert said. "I saw 
a rule that interested me, sat back and thought how I could make it work for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Benkert's flight of fancy resulted in a 60-yard touchdown against Oxnard on 
Thursday night, a first-class ticket to the end zone thanks to the whim of a 
coach traveling coach. 
</P>
<P>
He had uncovered an obscure rule that applies only to high school football, a 
rule that allows for unlimited forward passes on a single play -- provided they 
are thrown from behind the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
This is a departure from college and professional rules, which allow only one 
forward pass per play. 
</P>
<P>
Against Oxnard, quarterback Todd Preston took a deep drop and lofted a pass to 
wide receiver Seamus Gibbons, who stood a few steps behind the line of 
scrimmage with blockers in front of him. Gibbons then fired downfield to 
flanker Erik Holcomb, who was 10 yards from the nearest defender. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a double pass with a wide receiver, but I've never seen it beginning 
with a blatant forward pass," Benkert said. 
</P>
<P>
The play was marvelously effective for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
* It begins as a regular screen pass, developing far more slowly than a 
traditional double pass. Defenders initially backpedal, thinking pass, then 
shift gears and charge forward when the quarterback passes to the receiver. 
Only then does the first receiver cut loose with the bomb to the second 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
* Preston's pass to Gibbons travels forward about 10 yards, giving the 
appearance that the receiver already had crossed the line of scrimmage. The 
second pass astonishes defenders, many of whom think it's illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, who tend to study the rule book more than coaches, rightly kept 
their yellow flags folded and tucked. 
</P>
<P>
"We were aware of the rule, and we were aware of the play because the coach let 
us know about it before the game," said Pete Rogalsky, the referee in the 
Westlake-Oxnard game. 
</P>
<P>
Impartiality does not prohibit admiring originality. 
</P>
<P>
"It was well-designed," Rogalsky said. "Lots of teams have a double pass, but 
I've never seen this particular play." 
</P>
<P>
The lesson? The play was conceived by a coach who took time to read the rule 
book. And that is an exception to the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Double-double defense: The studious coach also might find buried in the rule 
book an effective defense against Westlake's double whammy. 
</P>
<P>
Pass interference can only be called on the first pass, according to Rogalsky. 
</P>
<P>
As the first receiver's long pass is sailing through the air, the prudent 
defender can blast the second receiver, effectively grounding the second half 
of a team's connecting flight. 
</P>
<P>
Zero hour: Area teams were involved in 11 shutouts Friday night. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* St. Francis (2-0) and Fillmore (2-0) each registered their second consecutive 
shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
* Oak Park was shut out by Fillmore after beating Leffingwell Christian, 63-0, 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
* Burroughs was a 63-0 victim of Quartz Hill, marking the second week in a row 
the Indians have been shut out. 
</P>
<P>
* Grant blanked Verdugo Hills, 2-0, on a punt snap that sailed through the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong-way Rodgers: Had Bobby Rodgers' uniform been equipped with a compass, 
there would have been an even dozen shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy junior, playing in his first varsity game, lived every defensive 
player's nightmare Friday night: He intercepted a pass and sprinted 82 yards to 
the end zone, the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like the referee told me, 'You hear about it, but you don't believe it until 
you see it,' " Rodgers said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy led Narbonne, 36-0, in the fourth quarter when a deflected pass flew 
into the arms of Rodgers, a 6-foot, 180-pound starting outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hit two times and spun around," Rodgers said. "When I stopped spinning, 
I was so excited, my first varsity game, I just ran . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 . .. the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't hit me until I got to the sideline," Rodgers said. "I felt real bad 
but guys came over and said I did a good job. The coach said, 'It happens, it 
happens.' That made me feel real good."

Narbonne was awarded a safety, which cost Kennedy a shutout. But the Golden 
Cougars were more concerned with the well-being of their misdirected teammate. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Don't worry about it,' " said Tyrone Allen, who plays alongside 
Rodgers at linebacker. "At first I wanted to take my helmet off and throw it at 
him. But he got caught up in the crowd and all. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those amazing things." 
</P>
<P>
While Rodgers was streaking down the field, Kennedy quarterback Michael 
McMullen was screaming at him from the sidelines to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," McMullen said. "Unbelievable. It doesn't happen. But 
after a minute or so, we laughed about it. Everybody told him, 'That's OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
Despite the embarrassment, Rodgers doesn't want the play forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping the coach gives me a copy of the film," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Will he be able to laugh about it in a few years? 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, sooner," he said.

MANN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN; 
</P>
<P>
MINOR LEAGUES: CULVER CITY CATCHER THINKS ARM, NOT BAT WILL EARN HIM SPOT ON 
ATLANTA BRAVES' ROSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Atlanta catcher Kelly Mann was double-checking the guest list before a game 
against Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium when Braves Manager Bobby Cox walked by 
the rookie in the team's locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"Got any extra seats, Kelly?" Cox asked Mann, who had been called up from the 
minors five days before the game. "I need two." 
</P>
<P>
Mann replied: "Sorry. I'm using all of mine." 
</P>
<P>
Despite playing for a team that was 23 1/2 games out of first place, Mann had 
30 requests for tickets and no cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
Cox didn't feel slighted, because he knew Mann was playing in front of his 
family and friends for only the second time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, who lives in Culver City, made his first appearance at Dodger Stadium 
last September and got a hit off pitcher Fernando Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great," said Mann, who grew up rooting for Steve Garvey, Bill Russell, 
Ron Cey, Steve Yeager and Rick Monday. "I went one for three and threw out a 
baserunner. I've played my best games against the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
Mann also had a single and a double last season against the Dodgers in Atlanta 
before an agitated Orel Hershiser welcomed the rookie to the majors with an 
inside fastball. He left the game with a bruised elbow. In eight games, he 
finished with five hits in 24 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, however, didn't play during the recent two-game series, the last one in 
Los Angeles this season. In a pregame meeting, Cox explained that the Braves 
would use veterans to try to extend their five-game winning streak, but he 
would do his best to get the rookies into the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he would try to get us in, but it would be hard to get playing time 
because the team was on a roll," said Mann, who hasn't batted since being 
promoted on Sept. 1. "I'm just glad to be here. I'll wait until my time comes." 
</P>
<P>
After five seasons in the minors, Mann will have a good shot at making the 
Braves' roster next season. Despite batting under .200 for the Richmond Braves, 
Mann was one of the top catchers in the International League (triple-A), 
throwing out 64% of the runners attempting to steal. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through a really bad slump," Mann said. "But I showed everyone what I 
could do defensively, and that's why I'm here in the majors." 
</P>
<P>
Quick turnaround: As reported earlier, former Harbor College standout John 
Ingram gave up a home run to the first batter he faced in the minor leagues. It 
turned out to be the only home run he would give up. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram, a left-handed reliever, had 0-1 record and four saves for Batavia, N.Y. 
(the Philadelphia Phillies' single-A team) in the New York-Penn League. He 
lowered his earned-run average from 15.00 to 2.18. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous and stuff that first game," Ingram said. "I haven't been touched 
since then." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram earned an invitation to play at Veteran's Stadium in the Young Timers' 
exhibition prior to the start of the Phillies-Pittsburgh Pirates game. He will 
leave today to participate for five weeks in Floria Instructional League at the 
Phillies' training camp in Clearwater, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Then he will return home. 
</P>
<P>
"How well I work and push myself this winter will determine my success next 
season," Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
Learning tricks of the trade: Former Cal State Dominguez Hills pitcher Rick 
Davis discovered that he can't fool batters with his knuckle-curveball as 
easily at the higher levels. 
</P>
<P>
Davis thought that he had a good season despite a 10-9 record and a 3.04 ERA 
for the San Diego Padres' single-A affiliate in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Davis was selected right-handed pitcher of the year in the 
Northwest League. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to do with being in a tougher league," said Davis, who had 122 
strikeouts and an unprecedent 44 walks. "You have to look for ways to get outs 
other than strikeouts. You have to depend on your fielders more because 
everyone can hit the ball at this level." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has been hampered by a sore shoulder, will work out with Padres 
trainer Dick Dent and might play winter ball in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Next season, he hopes to advance to the double-A level. 
</P>
<P>
"Every team needs pitching," Davis said, confidently. "The Padres got a lot of 
young guys, but they still need more pitching."

JAMES FLANIGAN: A NEW MILITARY FOR THE POST-COLD WAR ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks partly to the Iraq crisis -- and partly to the Cold War's end -- U.S. 
military forces will have fewer personnel on active service but more in ready 
reserve, and the types of major weapons will be different from what they've 
been for the past 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
That's the picture emerging from top-level thinking at the Pentagon and the 
negotiations on defense spending at last week's budget summit between Congress 
and the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The specific numbers on defense cuts may not look impressive. Budget 
negotiators' projections show an annual defense budget five years from now, 
with zero growth after inflation, of $294 billion -- compared to $298 billion 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
But, behind the numbers, dramatic changes are going forward. Military forces 
will be reduced by 25%, or 500,000 service personnel during the next few years. 
Civilian employees of the military will be cut 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, cutting people won't reduce defense spending all that much. For real 
savings, you need to make the hard, politically charged decisions to close 
military bases, says Secretary of the Army Michael P. W. Stone. Inevitably, 
though, changes in strategy and the military's role will shutter many bases 
that are operating today at only 50% of capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Similar long-term changes will cut the defense industry from 3.5 million 
employees currently to 1.5 million, says Lawrence Korb, former assistant 
secretary of defense and now a fellow of the Brookings Institution. The 
reductions will come slowly, to be sure, over 10 years. In the interim, defense 
firms will have a chance to adapt to the post-Cold War environment. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraq crisis is a field test for that environment, say military thinkers, 
for the kind of military forces and equipment the United States needs now that 
its adversary is no longer the Soviet Union and the projected terrain of battle 
is no longer the settled infrastructure of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, we have bases and support systems ready to receive more troops in 
case of war," explains Michael Rich, a military analyst at RAND Corp., the 
Santa Monica research firm. "But in places like the Persian Gulf, we operate 
with no fixed infrastructure; everything is mobile." 
</P>
<P>
Right now in the Gulf, the U.S. military's communications and computer systems, 
its mobile health-care facilities -- not to mention its ability to deliver 
gallons of water to thirsty troops -- are being tested. Lessons learned there 
will lead to new or changed products for the military. 
</P>
<P>
In larger weapons programs, too, the Iraq crisis is having an influence. 
Transport is in, for example. Delay in getting U.S. tanks to Saudi Arabia has 
led to recognition that the Navy, which spent massively on warships in the 
1980s, overlooked transport craft and now needs cargo ships. In fact, says a 
defense expert, "what is needed is a renewal of our Merchant Marine" -- which 
dwindled from 2,000 ships to 400 in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The need for air transport ensures support in Congress for McDonnell Douglas' 
C-17 cargo plane program, says investment analyst George Shapiro of Salomon 
Bros. On the other hand, a big bomber program such as Northrop's B-2 will be 
allowed only to "limp along" if Congress doesn't kill it outright. 
</P>
<P>
And that suggests a pattern for the new environment. Sophisticated weapons 
systems, designed to counter equally sophisticated Soviet technology, are 
likely to be put on hold. (Research won't be cut too sharply, because the 
Soviet Union is continuing its military R&amp;D. But the military is no longer 
first priority for the Soviets, or for the Americans either.) U.S. weapons that 
will be favored are those that can be deployed quickly and confidently. 
</P>
<P>
So the highly sophisticated Advanced Tactical Fighter program -- now in the 
prototype stage -- will be delayed indefinitely, say experts. But there will be 
several years of additional orders for tried and true fighter planes, such as 
McDonnell Douglas' F-15 and General Dynamics' F-16. 
</P>
<P>
The Army doesn't need more tanks, but it wants artillery pieces that can be 
dropped by parachute and set up anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the search for "flexibility," however, lies the hard reality of tighter 
defense budgets. With fewer new planes needed, fewer defense contractors will 
be needed. So there will be a wave of mergers similar to the 1950s and '60s, 
when Martin Aircraft merged with Marietta, North American merged with Rockwell, 
and Douglas merged with McDonnell. 
</P>
<P>
The armed services will cope with tight budgets by making more use of reserves, 
in much the way businesses use contract labor. The military uses reserves now, 
of course, and has called up many in the Iraq crisis. In the future, more 
personnel will be kept in reserve, backing up slimmed-down regular forces that 
will number about 1 million -- half today's total -- and be organized in 
smaller units for speed and flexibility of action. 
</P>
<P>
In no way, however, will the reduced Army or Navy be what the military was 
between World Wars I and II or after the Civil War, a force of diminished 
capacity and respect. "The U.S. can't go back into isolation," says Lawrence 
Korb. "At the end of the 20th Century, it has to take the lead to keep the 
world economic system working." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, post-Cold War means more demanding missions for the armed 
services and defense industry. May slimming-down keep them in fighting trim.

TOUGH POLICY ON PATENTS SCARES SMALLER FIRMS; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: BIG COMPANIES ARE DIGGING IN TO PROTECT THEIR INTELLECTUAL WEALTH. 
WILL BIGGER ROYALTIES COME AT THE EXPENSE OF COMPETITION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just inside the lobby of Texas Instruments' headquarters in Dallas hang two of 
the electronics giant's most important documents: its patents for the 
integrated circuit and the handheld calculator. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Texas Instruments, which holds more than 5,000 patents covering other 
significant technology advances, is patent proud. If the company gets its way, 
it will be patent wealthy as well. 
</P>
<P>
Already, patent licensing fees generate about $150 million in annual revenue 
for the company. This continuing royalty stream was the reason Texas 
Instruments -- whose operations are losing money -- was able to report a profit 
in its most recent quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Further, analysts have estimated, a new round of patent licensing negotiations 
under way could generate annual revenue for Texas Instruments of $400 million 
to more than $1 billion, or as much as about 15% of the company's total 1989 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Instruments is widely considered the most aggressive U.S. corporation in 
mining the moneymaking potential of its patents. Its bold moves have generated 
considerable controversy and ill will within the high-tech industry, and 
several patent lawsuits involving the company have been filed in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But the company is just one of a rising number of electronics companies that 
are recognizing the increasing value of patents and trying to exploit them for 
cash, technology bartering and market-share protection, as well as for their 
traditional role of fostering better, more technically advanced products. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred in part by increased competitive pressures and strengthened patent 
laws, electronics firms such as Motorola and International Business Machines 
are also in the act. They are aggressively filing lawsuits against perceived 
patent infringers, increasing royalty fees charged for use of their patented 
technology under license and seeking new patents in record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of this patent push -- principally large firms that have invested 
billions in new technology -- say this trend will spur U.S. technological 
competitiveness by rewarding them for their efforts and providing revenue to 
fund continued advances. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should we invest billions and billions in research and development if some 
company can just rip it off?" asks John McDonnell, chief patent counsel for 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. "Patents are a weapon in our competitive 
arsenal." 
</P>
<P>
Critics -- including some newer, smaller semiconductor companies -- say this 
trend could make it impossible for entrepreneurial firms to compete with big 
ones. That, they contend, could harm American competitiveness, because small 
firms often develop new technologies but need access to older technologies to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
Patents in the United States give their owners complete control over new, 
useful and "non-obvious" ideas or inventions for 17 years. In some industries, 
particularly pharmaceuticals and chemicals, technology covered by patents is 
rarely licensed to rivals because products produced by the technology provide 
major revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, electronics companies had rarely given their patents that level 
of protection, in part because business didn't dictate it. The potential market 
was too large for one company to serve alone, and it was still rapidly 
expanding. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. electronics industry is experiencing increasing competition, 
particularly from foreign technology giants, at a time its once-torrid growth 
rate is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
"For many years and for many companies, patents were a prize to hang on a wall. 
One of my clients even had his 15 patents bronzed," says Larry Rogers, an 
attorney with Fish &amp; Neave, a New York law firm specializing in patent law. 
"But now companies are discovering that their patents have more value than they 
ever realized. And they are moving to extract that worth out of them." 
</P>
<P>
As Texas Instruments is so amply demonstrating, once-overlooked and undervalued 
patent portfolios are a source of revenue to replace lost sales. Increasing 
patent royalties are also helping to underwrite the skyrocketing costs of 
maintaining research and development laboratories, facilities that U.S. 
companies are repeatedly accused of ignoring. 
</P>
<P>
But, perhaps most important, aggressive patent enforcement is being used to 
thwart competition, particularly from foreign rivals who in past years have 
blatantly copied U.S. technology, despite its presumed patent protection, and 
proceeded to take over electronics markets once dominated by U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
But patent protection for key inventions doesn't last forever. As the arms race 
among technology companies escalates to include patents, companies must 
continuously replenish their patent stockpiles or risk being left behind -- or 
worse yet, wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
And as pressure mounts to accumulate significant patent portfolios, either for 
technological edge or barter, smaller high-tech companies are complaining that 
they are at the mercy of older and larger competitors and in danger of being 
stomped out. 
</P>
<P>
Patents only recently moved off the sidelines of corporate affairs, a 
development widely credited to Congress' 1982 establishment of the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as the single appellate court for patent 
cases. Until then, patent appeals were heard in any one of 12 regional courts, 
with rulings varying according to each court's view. 
</P>
<P>
Creation of the new court was followed in the mid-1980s by literally dozens of 
new laws aimed at protecting patent holders and their "intellectual property." 
</P>
<P>
"This more 'pro-patent' approach allowed corporations to view their patents as 
an asset they could count on to protect their existing market share or gain new 
share," explains Vince Belusko, an attorney with Spensley, Horn, Jubas &amp; 
Lubitz, a Los Angeles firm specializing in patent law. 
</P>
<P>
Initial patent protection actions were aimed at foreign competitors, namely the 
large Japanese electronics makers that were selling computer memory chips, 
known as DRAMs, at prices far below those of U.S. manufacturers. Although U.S. 
companies complained that pricing was unfair because the semiconductors were 
being "dumped" below cost, the real insult to many U.S. companies, particularly 
Texas Instruments, was that the DRAMs were being made with technology the U.S. 
firms had patented. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Instruments sued eight Japanese firms and one Korean concern in the 
mid-1980s and won. That set the stage for DRAM licensing agreements that have 
proven lucrative, bringing the Dallas-based firm $600 million in revenue during 
the past four years. The company has actively sought similar licensing 
agreements throughout the U.S. semiconductor and computer industry, resorting 
to lawsuits when its licensing efforts have been spurned. 
</P>
<P>
Further, according to Japanese newspaper accounts, as its initial DRAM 
licensing agreements are set to expire at year-end, Texas Instruments is said 
to be asking Japanese semiconductor makers for royalties of 10% of production 
value, about twice the average rate charged by other companies. Texas 
Instruments officials refuse to comment on the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola's pioneering cellular telephone operation was also in danger of 
falling prey in the mid-1980s to below-cost pricing by Japanese manufacturers 
using the American company's patented technology without permission. Motorola 
filed actions with U.S. trade authorities and demanded immediate royalty 
payments for use of its patents. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Motorola got what it wanted. And today, the company credits the new 
patent laws for helping it save its cellular business, a unit widely viewed as 
among the nation's most innovative technology operations. 
</P>
<P>
But Motorola is deliberately holding back some of its radio and cellular 
patents from its licensing program. "Patents are more valuable to us now," says 
Vincent Rauner, Motorola's senior vice president for patents, trademarks and 
licensing. "We use them to protect our key technology." 
</P>
<P>
IBM, whose patent portfolio is among the world's largest, broadly licenses 
virtually its entire portfolio to other companies, often in exchange for 
equally broad cross-licensing agreements that give Big Blue access to a wide 
range of technology. 
</P>
<P>
If the portfolios are of unequal value -- and they often are -- IBM demands 
royalties. However, industry sources say those rates have been increasing in 
recent years, and IBM has more aggressively challenged companies whose products 
appear to infringe its patents. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an active licensing program and we will be calling on companies we 
feel are using our patents," says Howard G. Figueroa, head of IBM's 
intellectual property unit. 
</P>
<P>
Even American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, once the source of profuse and 
inexpensive technology licensing for the U.S. electronics industry, is starting 
to charge big bucks for its patents. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two decades, a court order required virtually every invention from 
its venerated Bell Laboratories to be put up for license because of Ma Bell's 
monopoly status. But when AT&amp;T was broken up in 1984, that order was 
lifted. AT&amp;T has since refused to license some patents and has increased 
royalty fees. 
</P>
<P>
"Royalties are more important now," admits AT&amp;T chief patent counsel 
McDonnell, noting that the company spends about $3 billion per year running 
Bell Labs. 
</P>
<P>
Such moves have upset many in the electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Tandy Corp. filed suit against Texas Instruments, claiming 
that its Dallas neighbor was demanding "unreasonably high" royalty payments. In 
addition, Tandy alleged that Texas Instruments is trying force it to pay for 
licenses it does not need as a condition of gaining access to technology it 
does want. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Silicon Valley, eight small semiconductor makers, including 
such bitter competitors as Cypress Semiconductor, Integrated Device Technology, 
VLSI Technology and LSI Logic, have banded together to fight a recent spate of 
patent lawsuits from Texas Instruments as well as increased licensing fee 
demands from several large electronics companies. 
</P>
<P>
"They have done it to themselves," Jack Menache, an attorney for Integrated 
Device Technology, was quoted as saying of the large companies with extensive 
patent portfolios. "They have created the underground, the resistance." 
</P>
<P>
Resistance or not, Texas Instruments intends to stay the course. "Guys who made 
the inventions should reap the benefits," says Mel Sharp, the firm's patent 
counsel. "That may ruffle some feathers among U.S. companies that think they 
have a birthright to getting technology free. But it's just tough."

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / ALLAN H. MELTZER: DEPOSIT INSURANCE SYSTEM WAS 
CULPRIT IN S&amp;L MESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN H. MELTZER, ALLAN H. MELTZER is a professor of political economy at 
Carnegie Mellon University and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise 
Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where was the press when the savings and loan industry got into its current 
mess? A financial press that prides itself on its hard-nosed, investigative 
journalism did little to bring the deteriorating condition of the industry to 
light. Washington is crowded with reporters. Yet, when their opportunity came, 
the financial press mishandled it. 
</P>
<P>
For years, economists have pointed to the flaws in the deposit insurance system 
that encourages S&amp;L managers to take high risks when their equity position 
is low. As S&amp;L failures developed, these alarm bells were ringing more and 
more frequently. Conferences and books developed the theme. Members of 
Congress, the press and the regulators participated at many of these 
conferences. Still, little was done to bring the problem to public attention or 
to correct it. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, some economists at the regulatory agencies produced regular 
estimates of the growing magnitude of the losses. By 1985, many S&amp;Ls had 
sustained losses so large that they were technically insolvent. One economist, 
Edward Kane, coined the term "zombie S&amp;Ls" for the associations that, 
though insolvent, were kept in business by the regulators and ignored by 
Congress and the financial press. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, the press contributes to congressional efforts to obscure the causes 
of the failure. Congressional investigations seem designed to convince the 
public that the massive losses imposed on the public came about because of the 
corrupt, criminal or unethical behavior of some slick operators. 
</P>
<P>
The slick operators were part of the problem, but a small part. A careful study 
of the losses by Alexandria, Va., thrift consultant Bert Ely, an expert on the 
industry, found that fraud was responsible for losses of $5 billion out of the 
nearly $150-billion cost to the taxpayers. Add $3 billion for losses on junk 
bonds and another $3 billion for losses on non-real estate investments. These 
losses together are about 7% of the total cost. And, some of the losses on junk 
bonds and non-real estate investments are the result of honest mistakes, 
choices that can be criticized only with hindsight. 
</P>
<P>
Ely's estimate may be off the mark. Suppose the losses from bad judgment, fraud 
and chicanery are 10% of the total. Add another $5 billion for Ely's estimate 
of the excess cost of the hasty 1988 sales of S&amp;Ls that some in Congress 
are investigating diligently. More than 81% of the losses have other causes. 
Why are they ignored? 
</P>
<P>
I am not opposed to congressional investigation of fraud. Far from it. It is 
important to know why, how and by whom the public was defrauded. The Justice 
Department is also investigating these cases and properly so. 
</P>
<P>
My objection is that by focusing exclusively on the 7% to 10%, Congress ignores 
the bulk of the problem and does nothing to avoid a repetition. The press 
contributes by giving the public the impression that Congress is hard at work 
learning who is to blame, avoiding a repetition and developing a safe and sound 
financial system. 
</P>
<P>
The unreported story is a tale of administrative failure, regulatory failure, 
failure of congressional oversight and, most of all, flawed institutions. The 
arrangements, designed to protect the public from the consequences of bank 
failures, didn't work as intended. True, the banks and S&amp;Ls didn't shut 
their doors, wiping out the depositors' accounts. But that is not much 
consolation to the average taxpayer who will pay about $1,500 for his or her 
share of the losses. 
</P>
<P>
Deposit insurance began as a program to protect small savers against bank runs 
-- attempts by depositors to get their money out before a bank failed. When 
deposit insurance began in the 1930s, insurance was limited to $2,500 per 
depositor. In today's depreciated dollars that would be about $25,000, an 
amount far above the amount held by most depositors. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, the limits were raised. By the mid-1980s, accounts were insured to 
$100,000. And when banks or S&amp;Ls were about to fail, regulators would 
usually protect all depositors without any limit at all. For large banks, the 
doctrine became "too big to fail." Everyone was assured that the government or 
regulators would not allow a big bank to fail, no matter how unwise or risky 
its lending practices. This policy encouraged risk taking and, ultimately, 
large losses. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the regulators examined and supervised banks on a regular basis. As 
we know from successive rounds of defaults on Latin American debt, real estate 
loans, energy loans and loans for leveraged buyouts, supervision and 
examination are weak reeds on which to rest the safety and soundness of the 
financial system. 
</P>
<P>
Something is rotten in our system. If we look north to Canada, east to Europe 
or west to Japan, we do not find anything comparable to our experience. Few of 
these banking systems have experienced problems of failure and costly bailouts 
by taxpayers. These countries, too, have endured oil shocks, rapid 
disinflation, real estate booms and the like. But so far only U.S. taxpayers 
have ended up bailing out large parts of the financial system. 
</P>
<P>
Real financial reform will not come until large depositors have an incentive to 
monitor what their banks do, just as they monitor the credit worthiness of 
other parties who owe them money. It would be difficult and costly for small 
depositors to do the same. They could be protected by offering them the option 
of keeping their deposits in accounts that are completely secured by Treasury 
bills -- direct obligations of the federal government. Such accounts are 
available now at some money market mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department will present a plan for deposit insurance reform this 
winter. Early rumblings from the Treasury suggest that their proposals for 
change will be modest, little different than current practice. They seem likely 
to keep deposit insurance as it is and promote better supervision, more capital 
and more careful examination. This would be more of the same -- a repeat of the 
past mistakes that helped to produce the current failures. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional elections are coming this fall, before the Treasury's report. 
Candidates will probably repeat the stories about fraud, chicanery and 
mischief. And, they'll promise to punish wrongdoers. But they won't talk about 
major reform to prevent a repetition or explain why the U.S. financial system 
-- regulated and insured for decades -- has been so costly to taxpayers and 
depositors and so prone to failure compared to systems in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The public would be more likely to question the candidates if the press would 
inform them about the facts of the case. Stories of fraud and personal failure 
may make good copy but that's only 10% of the story. The other 90% needs to be 
heard and fixed also.

READERS OUTRAGED OVER CELEBRITY CAMPAIGN TO HAVE SENTENCING JUDGE GO EASY ON 
MILKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I just read that "They Like Mike." His Highness the Junk Bond King. Who are 
they? As near as I can determine, they are the very privileged few, with 
virtually no background in jurisprudence, except perhaps Chief Daryl Gates, who 
while not espousing pardon for Milken, seems to be caught up in that very 
dubious practice of unleashing the "talents" of some of our most devious 
criminals to work with the youth of America, thereby setting some very 
confusing parameters for them to employ when they mature. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David W. Golde writes to Milken's trial judge that "Milken is not a 
criminal in the normal sense of the word." Milken is a genuine criminal beyond 
doubt and should spend the bulk of his life in prison. He is a convicted thief 
who has decimated the entire financial structure of our nation, not by 
brilliant displays of acumen, buy by illegal stealth. 
</P>
<P>
He is as responsible as anyone for the heinous rape of our S&amp;L system, 
which will have generations of Americans paying taxes to back up the "good 
faith" of the U.S. government. As for his supporters, hardly a deep thinking 
brain among them, merely self-centered fools who demonstrate no ken whatsoever 
of the basic tenets of justice.

DEVELOPERS DEFEND PORTER RANCH BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Barth's Sept. 2 commentary criticizing the city's approval of the 
Porter Ranch plan claims that development requires tremendous increases in 
public service and infrastructure costs that far outweigh increases in tax 
revenues. While this may be the case with other developments, it is not true of 
Porter Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch Development Co. is paying for all of the infrastructure within the 
specific plan area, such as roads, sewers, utilities, parks, etc. Outside the 
specific plan we are providing more than $50 million in transportation 
infrastructure improvements throughout the entire northwest San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
These "hard" infrastructure costs are in addition to millions of dollars in 
permit fees, sewer fees, water hookups, etc. the company will be required to 
pay. These benefits go to the city of Los Angeles before any increases in tax 
revenue are taken into account. In Porter Ranch's case, full build-out will 
produce about $38 million -- in today's dollars -- annually in new tax revenue. 
These new revenues will more than cover many "soft" infrastructure costs, such 
as police and public health services. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch Development Co. is donating land for a municipal building, a 
library and a fire station. We are building the fire station and furnishing all 
of the equipment, including fire trucks, to the city free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
Barth claims that the jobs created to fulfill the city's jobs/housing balance 
requirement will not match the income needed to live in Porter Ranch. But 
official figures show an almost exact statistical correlation between projected 
income levels of residents and projected income levels for the jobs created. 
</P>
<P>
Barth says there will be more car trips and pollution because of the project. 
On the contrary, auto trips would be longer and pollution worse without the 
plan. Not only will Porter Ranch provide jobs and shopping closer to residents 
but the mitigations required by the plan will result in improved traffic 
conditions. The South Coast Air Quality Management District says the project 
will not affect the region's air quality goals. 
</P>
<P>
Barth's allegations can be refuted by a simple review of the public records. 
However, what is most disturbing is outlandish claim that Porter Ranch 
Development Co. improperly influenced City Council approval with political 
contributions. We respond to donation requests from numerous community groups, 
political committees and charitable organizations.

READERS OUTRAGED OVER CELEBRITY CAMPAIGN TO HAVE SENTENCING JUDGE GO EASY ON 
MILKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was bemused by the outpouring of love and affection shown towards Mike Milken 
in your Sept. 11 article. 
</P>
<P>
The relevant issue here is not whether Milken is a good math teacher, or that 
he danced with "skinny" and "plump" girls in his 5th grade ballroom dance 
class, or that he donated money to charity. The issue is that Milken was a 
willing, knowing criminal. He should now be punished severely for his chosen 
role as a felon.

<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your article "They Like Mike" (Sept. 11) on the letters of support 
for Michael Milken, Milken has pleaded guilty to stealing enough money to live 
comfortably after paying $600 million in fines and giving many other millions 
of stolen dollars to charity. His sale of junk bonds has been instrumental in 
the failure of countless businesses, careers and lives. 
</P>
<P>
He has been deeply implicated in the theft of more than $1,000 from every man, 
woman and child in this country through his involvement in the S&amp;L debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Greed is a constant in human existence and many thieves have felt guilty enough 
to give part of their ill-gotten gains to worthy causes. It is harder to 
understand the myopia of leaders such as Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahoney, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig, et al. It would seem 
their moral and ethical values are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest for me to understand is Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. A man 
in charge of 8,400 armed men and women off-handedly recommends the execution of 
misdemeanor drug users after writing a letter in support of parole for an 
admitted and convicted felon. Where is the consistency in this? He cites 
Milken's willingness to go into dangerous neighborhoods to work. Perhaps Gates 
would recommend parole for our local gang bangers to go into some of those same 
neighborhoods. After all, they would be more than willing and they have already 
killed hundreds of casual drug users.

HOT PROPERTY: 'FUNNIEST' HOST IS A SERIOUS BUYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOB SAGET, host of ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos" and star of the ABC 
sitcom "Full House," and his wife, SHERRI KRAMER SAGET, have purchased a newly 
built house in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
On "Full House," Bob Saget plays a single parent of three young daughters; in 
real life, he and his wife have two. His wife was a practicing attorney, 
specializing in probate and estate planning, before the children were born. 
</P>
<P>
Their new home -- a two-story Mediterranean -- had been listed at $2,995,000. 
Sources indicated that the Sagets paid between $2.4 million and $2.6 million, 
but a spokesman for Saget denied it. Public records show that the Sagets have a 
$1.8 million first-trust deed on the property, but there was no information on 
how large a down payment, if any, was made. 
</P>
<P>
The house has four bedrooms and 5 1/2 baths plus maid's quarters in 6,500 
square feet, an industry source said. There is a 30-foot-high, tiled-floor 
entry and a library with cherry wood paneling. 
</P>
<P>
The master suite has a sitting area with a fireplace; a private balcony, 
exercise room, two walk-in closets and a bath with a spa, steam shower and 
sauna. There is a bonus room adjacent to the master suite that can be used as 
an additional bedroom, an office or a den. 
</P>
<P>
Situated on a private street, the home also has a large patio; tiled walkways; 
a swimming pool and an outdoor spa. 
</P>
<P>
The house that actor DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS and actress MARY PICKFORD had built for 
the manager of their 3,000-acre ranch in San Diego County has come on the 
market at $1.35 million. 
</P>
<P>
It was built in 1928 by architect Wallace Neff, who also turned a Beverly Hills 
hunting lodge into Pickfair, the couple's famous home. 
</P>
<P>
Now that most of Pickfair has been razed, the ranch house is being described by 
its owners as "the only remaining house in Southern California tied directly" 
to the late stars when they were married. The home was also the only one on the 
ranch until the posh Fairbanks Ranch residential community was developed there 
in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The early-Spanish California-style house has four bedrooms and two baths in 
2,300 square feet, and it sits on 1.5 acres, surrounded by parkland and 
adjacent to a stream. 
</P>
<P>
Its current owners, Bill and Mary Culver, bought it about five years ago from 
Nixon White House aide H.R. (BOB) HALDEMAN and his wife, Jo, who had planned to 
retire there but went instead to Santa Barbara, according to the Culvers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the house sandblasted and re-stuccoed. Then we refinished all the doors 
and windows," Bill Culver said. They also restored the center courtyard and 
disassembled, refinished and re-installed the old door locks and hardware from 
the pre-Pickfair hunting lodge, circa 1900. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope somebody will buy and love this place as we do and not tear it down to 
put up a typical, large Fairbanks Ranch house," said Mary Culver. 
</P>
<P>
The Culvers, who listed their home with their own Rancho Santa Fe realty firm, 
are planning to become organic herb farmers in another state. 
</P>
<P>
AARON and CANDY SPELLING'S 56,500-square-foot Holmby Hills mansion is expected 
to be completed by the end of this month, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, after they get their drapes and furniture in, they should be in the 
house, probably within the next two to three months," one of the sources said. 
All the furniture is in storage, waiting for the notice of completion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The mega mansion has taken four years to build, on the five-acre site of the 
former BING CROSBY home, a nearly 15,000-square-footer that the Spellings 
bought for $10.25 million in 1983, then had it demolished. 
</P>
<P>
The house that Spelling is building is said to out-dynasty "Dynasty," which -- 
along with "The Love Boat," "Fantasy Island," "Hotel" and other TV series that 
he produced -- made him one of the wealthiest men in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
However, despite what a neighbor once called "Look-at-me-I'm-rich" architecture 
and furnishings imported from Europe, industry sources have observed some cost 
cutting in the final weeks of its construction. 
</P>
<P>
"The tennis court and pool are really ordinary, and there isn't even a 
pavilion," one said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a budget for landscaping, and they cut it in half; there is a 
reflecting pool, but they cut out the fountain in the courtyard; the 
landscaping is mediocre, filler trees but no great specimens," another 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints about the house are nothing new to the Spellings, who incurred their 
neighbors' wrath over its size as soon as the steel frame went up. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Spellings themselves were getting tired of the project, because 
it's taken so long, and that's probably why they decided to reduce their 
spending and just finish it," a source said.

AMERICA'S HOUSING: NEW HOME AUCTIONS GAIN IN SLOW MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If you have a Rembrandt to sell, what do you do with it? Take it to your local 
art gallery? Or call Christie's for auction? Valuable horse flesh is sold at 
auction, just like wine. And what is the stock market? One big auction." 
</P>
<P>
So says Darrell Hoover, president of R. Thomas Ashley, a division of Hoover 
Financial Group in Newport Beach. Hoover also said that by the year 2000, up to 
30% of all real estate sold will be sold at auction. 
</P>
<P>
Auctions, once a strategy of a troubled financial institution trying to unload 
distressed properties quickly, are gaining acceptance in the conventional real 
estate market. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the busiest we've been in 13 years," said William McMorrow, chairman of 
Kennedy-Wilson Inc., a Santa Monica-based auction company. 
</P>
<P>
In some countries, such as Australia, auctions are used, not as a last resort, 
but to sell the best properties -- the high-priced ones, in the best 
neighborhoods and the hottest markets. 
</P>
<P>
At the high end of the market, auctions are employed in about half the sales in 
Melbourne, said Kenneth Lusht, director of the Institute for Real Estate 
Studies at Penn State University and author of a report about Melbourne's 
flourishing auction business sponsored by the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Auctions have a long history. The earliest references to auctions of grains and 
slaves predate Christ. They were used routinely to sell all sorts of 
commodities of indeterminate value throughout this country's early days in both 
rural and urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil War, however, did a terrible disservice to the auction. The federal 
government used auctions to liquidate large amounts of government property 
quickly to finance the war effort. Eventually, auctions became enmeshed in 
creditor-debtor laws and served only to liquidate goods quickly to extinguish 
debts. And that was where they were imbued with their scruffy reputation. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until the 1970s and early 1980s, when interest rates rose sky high, 
that financial institutions were faced with the need to sell holdings quickly. 
In experimenting with a number of alternatives, including swaps and owner 
financing, they rediscovered the auction. 
</P>
<P>
The quick sale of distressed properties, however, is not the only circumstance 
in which an auction works well. There are several ideal markets for auctions, 
said Steven Good of Sheldon Good &amp; Co., a Chicago-based firm that evolved 
from a traditional real estate brokerage in the early 1970s to one of the 
country's largest real estate auction houses. 
</P>
<P>
Among the ideal auction markets, Good listed: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A slow market or one with excess supply in which a builder anticipates 
holding properties for a long period. In this instance, he might choose an 
auction over a conventional sale because of the high cost of holding a property 
in order to pay taxes, maintenance and ongoing marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"A developer has to be able to increase prices 20% to 30% each year, just to 
break even," Good said. "Even if he has to sell at a discount, he is usually 
money ahead with a quick sale." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The volatile market, one moving up or down quickly. Here the auction 
functions as an evaluation tool. For example, when the California market was so 
hot a few years ago, stories abounded about people standing in driveways of 
homes for sale, bidding late into the night. What were those but informal 
auctions? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Declining or stagnant markets. In these times, auctions are used often as a 
tool to work out financial problems between developers and lenders. It is a 
situation in which selling quickly will minimize losses. 
</P>
<P>
What has been left out is the normal market, but some proponents see a future 
there too. 
</P>
<P>
"The auction's emerging trends are banks and savings and loans, builders and 
governmental agencies," Hoover said. "But the future is the almost untapped 
traditional resale market." 
</P>
<P>
And that may be the reason the National Assn. of Realtors, which once looked 
askance at auctions, met recently with members of the National Assn. of 
Auctioneers to learn how real estate agents can incorporate the auction into 
their traditional sales approach. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to educate our members who are not familiar with the process to 
recognize an auction situation," said Kenneth Kerin, senior vice president of 
the NAR and its staff director of the National Real Estate Auction Committee. 
"The auction is not always the last resort for selling a property. Sometimes it 
should be the first." 
</P>
<P>
For the seller, the advantage of an auction over a traditional sale is speed. 
The seller may pay more for that speed, however. Besides the up-front fees for 
advertising, auctioneers charge a commission of between 4% and 10% of the final 
sales price. 
</P>
<P>
For the buyer, the advantage is often a lower price. Discounts range from 15% 
to 45%, said one auctioneer. But that is not always the case. In his study of 
the Melbourne market, Lusht found that auctions brought prices of an average of 
7% higher than conventional sales techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents argue that an auction actually determines that real market better 
than the conventional sales process. 
</P>
<P>
"With an auction, it is argued that the merits of a property tend to be 
relatively more important in determining sales price than the bargaining 
strengths of the seller and potential buyer," Arthur L. Wright said in a 1989 
study for the NAR. 
</P>
<P>
"Sale terms are set prior to the auction and competition occurs among buyers 
rather than between the seller and a potential buyer. Thus, the technique 
places more emphasis upon marketing and less upon negotiating strategies than 
privately negotiated transactions -- with or without the assistance of a real 
estate broker." 
</P>
<P>
The whole process is in many ways similar to a conventional sale, but more 
compressed and considerably more tense. An auction often sports a bit of a 
circus or carnival atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
For example, at Sheldon Good &amp; Co., the auctioneers don auction uniforms -- 
blue suits adorned by red carnations. Music plays in the background of the 
hotel auditorium or space rented for the event, and typically there is a cash 
bar at the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
There are glossy brochures, audio-visual presentations and, for national 
auctions, even satellite hookups. Sheldon Good, Steven's father and the firm's 
founder, arrives in his bronze Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
In Melbourne, auctions have a more down-home feel and they are usually held on 
Saturday mornings on the front steps of the property for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the entire sales process takes four to six weeks. When a seller signs 
a contract with an auction company, he or she is expected to pay certain 
up-front fees for advertising and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
After blitz-style advertising in the market's major newspapers, there will be a 
marathon series of open houses with a full staff of salespeople. Colorful sales 
brochures are printed and provided to prospective buyers, who visit the 
properties an average of 3.2 times prior to attending an auction to bid. The 
goal of those marketing the property is to attain a critical mass of buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The marketing and open houses are familiar traditional techniques. But some 
preparation for an auction sale are quite different. Because auctions only work 
when bids are all on the same terms, the usual series of inspections is often 
performed in advance. Also, before the auction the seller usually chooses a 
"reserve," or base price. If the best offer is below that amount, the seller is 
free to turn down the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Usually buyers are required to submit a cashier's check in an amount equivalent 
to 10% of the day's minimum bid. If a buyer is successful, he or she must write 
a check immediately for the balance of the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Many major auction companies have a whole microcosm of the real estate industry 
available on auction day, including appraisers and loan officers, so that 
before the buyer has left, he or she has signed a sales contract, made a down 
payment and filled out all the required paper work. 
</P>
<P>
If auctions are the future, the question will become what does the future hold 
for auctions? 
</P>
<P>
If auctions gain as much market share as some are predicting, it is likely that 
they will be more regulated, Lusht said. Although state requirements vary 
widely, in California a person must hold both an auctioneer's license and a 
real estate license to sell real estate at auction. 
</P>
<P>
There are about a dozen major auction houses nationwide, and already a number 
of big real estate brokers are moving into the market, either by forming 
partnerships with established operations or by starting their own auction 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The auction organizations don't seem too worried about the competition. Of the 
3.6 million existing houses sold in 1988, auctioneers sold 18,300. If they gain 
a 30% market share, as some predict, the total will be so large that there will 
be enough business for everyone.

GOLDEN TIME ON THE 'GOLDEN MILE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Olga Marcus, whose marriage to Beverly Hills dentist David Marcus lasted almost 
six decades, suddenly found herself, at 80, alone and isolated. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrible shock when my husband passed away suddenly, in 1988," she 
said. "I'd always been rather slight, but David was like the Rock of Gibraltar. 
We both assumed I'd go first." 
</P>
<P>
The Marcuses lived for more than 30 years in a spacious contemporary home 
designed by John Lautner on one acre of Brentwood Park. 
</P>
<P>
"We led busy lives and entertained a lot," she said. "My husband's patients 
included many celebrities, and many were personal friends. My own involvement 
with politics also brought us into a wide circle of interesting people. 
</P>
<P>
"But with David gone, our wonderful house suddenly felt empty. I wanted out. 
</P>
<P>
"Well-meaning friends cautioned me not to think of moving, for at least a year. 
And my children pleaded with me to remain in the family home. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have continued there without any financial burden, but the house no 
longer fit my needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a pool I hadn't used in years, my garden had a half an acre of lawn and 
40 large cymbidiums that required special care. You can let dust accumulate in 
a home but you can't let a garden go." 
</P>
<P>
Far more appealing to Marcus was the thought of someday having valet parking at 
her beck and call and round-the-clock security. She envisioned a convenient 
location for friends to drop by, and public transportation that was close 
enough, if she decided not to drive. 
</P>
<P>
Four months after her husband passed away, Olga Marcus accepted a $2.5-million 
offer for her home and purchased a luxury condominium on Wilshire's Golden Mile 
near Westwood. The total cost for the three-bedroom apartment, including major 
renovation, came to about $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel as if I traded down. It was more like trading off. When my 
priorities changed, I wanted things that would free me to continue an active 
lifestyle and provide for any future physical limitations that might develop," 
Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only disadvantage about living in an apartment is that I can't go outside 
and cut flowers. So I now buy a lot of flowers and look for every opportunity 
to snip them from my friends' gardens." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus, a co-founder of volunteer organizations, Women For and Teach 
Foundation, as well as former key campaigner for presidential candidates, 
served 11 years on the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension Commission. She 
still keeps a full schedule. 
</P>
<P>
On Mondays she runs errands; Tuesdays, she attends board meetings as 
commissioner of the City Employees Retirement System, and as its newly elected 
president; Wednesdays, she joins in discussions sponsored by the Plato Society 
at UCLA; Thursdays, she gets her hair done and plays bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturdays I leave open for family and social functions, and Fridays and 
Sundays are for playing golf," said Marcus, who recently returned from a 
golf-playing tour of New Zealand and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be able to close the door and go -- whenever I feel like it." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus is aware of other domestic options, though it has never occurred to her 
to have someone live with her, though she can visualize eventually living in a 
retirement hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"In sickness you want your family around but when you're older, even more than 
family, you need companionship among peers with whom you can communicate," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"I have wonderful children who respond lovingly to my needs and I know I can 
always count on them. But I wouldn't want to live with my family. The less you 
rely on them the better the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting old is such a personal thing. I admire people who can cut themselves 
off from their community when they retire or become widowed. That takes a great 
deal of courage. I moved only a short distance away." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus describes life as a series of cycles. "When you finish one cycle in your 
life, you better close it and move on confidently to the next. I take each new 
cycle in stride."

TRADING DOWN;

AS LIVES, PRIORITIES CHANGE, SO DO HOUSING NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On paper, Helen and Saul Gealer look like a typical yuppie couple. 
</P>
<P>
They live in a bright, airy Westside condominium that's decorated with 
high-tech, black-and-white furniture. 
</P>
<P>
When Helen isn't busy with her duties as president of the complex's homeowners 
association, you'll catch her at the local gym or window-shopping along trendy 
Santa Monica Boulevard. Saul likes to dabble in antiques, especially classic 
cars and old golf clubs. 
</P>
<P>
But the Gealers aren't yuppies; they're both in their 70s. They can afford 
their current lifestyle because they sold their longtime home for a huge profit 
a few years ago and "traded down" into one that's smaller and easier to 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't regretted our decision for a minute," Helen Gealer said. "Getting 
rid of our big old house and buying this condo was one of the best moves we 
ever made." 
</P>
<P>
Older people trade down to a smaller home for a variety of reasons. Some do it 
because they don't need as much space as they used to, now that their children 
are gone or their spouse has died. 
</P>
<P>
Others move because they no longer have the energy or desire to cut the lawn, 
clean several rooms and perform all the other chores that come with owning a 
large home. 
</P>
<P>
Still others move because their longtime neighborhood has taken a turn for the 
worse since they originally moved in. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived in our old home for 26 years, but a lot of things had changed," Helen 
Gealer said. "Crime had gone up, traffic had gotten a lot worse and a lot of 
local stores had changed hands. And with all the kids gone, keeping a 
four-bedroom home just didn't make sense anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Financial pressures can also play a role. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you bought your home a long time ago and your monthly mortgage is low, 
maintaining a big home can be an expensive proposition -- especially if you're 
on a fixed income," said Morrie Reiff, a financial planner with Planned Asset 
Management in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people prefer to sell their house, buy something cheaper, and live 
off their excess profits." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of why you decide to trade down, you'll have three basic choices: 
buying a smaller single-family house, purchasing a townhouse or condominium or 
renting an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The first option -- selling your current home and purchasing a smaller house -- 
can provide several benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller homes are typically easier to maintain than big houses, and you'll be 
able to retain much more privacy. That's something that wouldn't be guaranteed 
if you moved into a condo or apartment complex, where you would share common 
walls and amenities with other people. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there's a good chance that you'll be able to take the proceeds 
from the sale of your current home and use the money to make a large down 
payment on your new house. That will keep your monthly payments low, an 
important point if cash will be short in your retirement years. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if you're like many older sellers, you might even have enough money 
from the sale of your current home to pay all cash for your new house. 
</P>
<P>
But Reiff cautions about doing that. "Paying all cash usually isn't a great 
idea from a financial planning point of view, in part because you won't be able 
to shelter any of your retirement income by taking mortgage-interest 
deductions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the truth is, a lot of my clients who trade down pay all-cash anyway. It 
makes them feel more comfortable knowing that they won't have to worry about 
making mortgage payments in their retirement years, and that feeling of 
security lets them sleep better at night." 
</P>
<P>
One potential drawback to buying a small single-family house is that you'll 
still have to maintain the property. "That's OK if you like gardening or doing 
simple home repairs," said Leah Dobkin, a housing specialist with the American 
Assn. of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
"But you won't be happy if you'd rather spend the time socializing, or if you 
become disabled and can't do the work anymore by yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The thought of spending their Golden Years shackled to housework is one reason 
why so many older people move into a condominium instead of a single-family 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"After 40 years of fixing broken pipes and spending Saturdays mowing the grass, 
I finally just said 'the hell with it' and moved into this condo," said Steve 
Carter, a 65-year-old retired aerospace worker who owns a two-bedroom unit in 
the Mission Valley area of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, when the building needs painting, the homeowners association does it. 
When my air-conditioning unit broke, the association fixed it. And I haven't 
touched a lawn mower since I moved in here two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Dobkin, the housing specialist at AARP, said moving to a condo can provide 
other benefits as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Most older people like to have a strong sense of security," Dobkin said. "A 
lot of condos have elaborate security systems, which makes people feel safer 
and less vulnerable to crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, with more older people traveling frequently, it's a lot simpler to just 
lock up and go," she said. "If they owned a house instead, they'd have to worry 
about break-ins, who'll water the lawn, who'll pick up the mail and a bunch of 
other stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, some seniors like to socialize and be around people of all ages. 
Condo projects tend to make that kind of interaction a little easier." 
</P>
<P>
If you're healthy and prefer that most of your neighbors are about your same 
age, you may want to consider buying a condo unit in an "active-adult" 
community. These developments are geared toward healthy older people and 
typically have at least one golf course, pool and recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, if you need frequent medical attention or extensive help with 
housekeeping chores, you might want to consider buying or renting a unit in a 
congregate-care facility. Many of these developments offer a variety of on-site 
medical services and also provide residents with meals, house cleaning services 
and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing to remember when you're buying a condo is to make sure 
that you don't pay for a lot of amenities that you don't need," said Temmy 
Walker, president of the James R. Gary East real estate office in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a tennis court or pool is great, and it can make your home more 
sellable if you eventually plan on moving again," Walker said. "But there's no 
reason to pay extra for all those amenities if you're never going to use them." 
</P>
<P>
As you look at various developments, pay close attention to the maintenance of 
the common areas. Neatly trimmed bushes and fresh paint are signs that the 
homeowners association is doing a good job of running the complex: Burned-out 
light bulbs and a dirty pool indicate that homeowners don't care much about 
their living environment. 
</P>
<P>
Look over the association's bylaws that govern the complex to make sure you can 
live with its rules, and request a copy of its latest financial statements to 
assure that there are adequate reserves to pay for future maintenance and 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Also try to attend at least one meeting of the homeowners association," Walker 
said. "You'll get a good idea of the types of people who live in the complex, 
and whether or not they get along with each other." 
</P>
<P>
Issues discussed at the meeting can also provide valuable clues about the 
complex itself. For example, if residents at the meeting discuss a recent rash 
of break-ins or the need to make expensive repairs, you might be better off 
looking somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
If you're simply tired of the duties involved in owning a home -- or if 
finances will be tight in your retirement years -- you might simply decide to 
move into a rental apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Your monthly cash outlays will likely be lower than if you bought a condo or 
house, and proceeds from the sale of your current home could be used to make 
investments that will supplement your retirement income. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of what type of home you choose -- a single-family house, condo or 
apartment -- you'll be faced with some important financial questions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest question is whether you should use the once-in-a-lifetime 
tax break that allows homeowners over age 55 to keep up to $125,000 of their 
profits tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think that this is the last move you'll ever make, or if you're going 
to make the full $125,000 from the sale, you'll probably want to take the 
exclusion now," said Karen Block, a partner in the Encino-based accounting firm 
of Block, Klein, Levin &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Block said, you might want to postpone using the exclusion 
if you plan on eventually moving again and profits from the sale of your 
current home will be less than $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
For example, let's say that you'll net $70,000 from the sale of your current 
home. If you exercise the exclusion now, you'll only get to pocket $70,000 
tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you don't exercise the exclusion now and eventually sell 
your next home for a $125,000 profit, you'll get to keep the entire $125,000 
tax-free instead of just $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
Since trading down to a smaller home has such important tax implications, it's 
a good idea to visit an accountant before you make your move. It's also wise to 
visit a financial planner to discuss various issues, such as whether you should 
finance your new home or pay all cash. 
</P>
<P>
Although leaving your longtime home and moving to someplace new can be a scary 
proposition, condo owner Helen Gealer and her husband advise older people to 
keep an open mind and study all their alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared to death at the thought of leaving my old house," she said. "But 
my life is so much happier and care-free now that we're in this condo. 
</P>
<P>
"My only regret is that we didn't move sooner." 
</P>

<P>
In a pilot program launched last Feb., 25, experienced gardeners became 
"Gardening Angels" and made gardening adventures a reality for about 1,500 
children in 20 schools who ordinarily would not have had the opportunity to 
plant, nurture and harvest their own vegetables and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer orientation will be held starting Sept. 18 and continuing Sept. 25 
from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at The Common Ground office, 2615 S. Grand Ave., Suite 
400, Los Angeles, Calif. 90007. 
</P>
<P>
To register, call Rachel Mabie at (213) 744-4349. 
</P>
<P>
The newly revised "Children's Gardens, A Guide for Parents, Teachers and 
Volunteers" will be given to each volunteer as well as to schools whose 
requests cannot be accommodated. The book, which is based on gardening 
activities in Southern California, is available to the public for $10 plus 
$2.50 handling and postage. The $10 price is tax-deductible, and the proceeds 
will benefit the children's gardens in the inner city. Checks for the book and 
for those who wish to make a donation should be made out to Los Angeles Urban 
Agriculture Corp. and sent to the Common Ground address above.

There are at least seven good reasons to plant a fall vegetable garden: 
cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, collards and kale. 
</P>
<P>
These cool-weather cole crops are members of the cabbage family ("cole" comes 
from caulis, the Latin name for cabbage). Crisp and crunchy, these vegetables 
flourish from now to early spring. 
</P>
<P>
Although commonly found at markets, many don't arrive fresh, and there are 
varieties with uncommonly good taste that only the home gardener can grow. 
Back-yard cabbage, for example, tastes remarkably sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
Below is a rundown of the cole crops and the best varieties of each for 
Southern California gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Cabbage 
</P>
<P>
Cabbage has been around as a cultivated crop for more than 2,000 years. An 
extremely adaptable vegetable, it thrives in gardens throughout most of the 
world. Seed catalogues in the United States alone list an astronomical 500 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Good green cabbage includes Early Jersey Wakefield, Emerald Cross Hybrid, 
Copenhagen Market, Stonehead Hybrid and Early Flat Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
Red cabbage adds color to the garden as well as to the salad bowl. Good red 
cabbage choices include Ruby Ball Hybrid, Ruby Perfection Hybrid and Scarlet 
O'Hara Hybrid. 
</P>
<P>
Savoy cabbages have crinkled foliage and the heads never become really hard. 
Many gardeners and gourmets consider savoy cabbage to have a sweeter, more 
delicate flavor than other cabbages. Savoy Ace, Savoy King and Early Curly 
Hybrid are superior savoy cabbages. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli 
</P>
<P>
Although broccoli was a prized addition to Roman gardens, it wasn't until the 
1920s that it was introduced to this country. California leads the nation in 
broccoli production. 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli transplants should be spaced 18 inches apart, and the central heads 
should be harvested when the buds are small and tight, before they open into 
tiny yellow flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Green Comet, Premium Corp Hybrid, Di Cicco, Bonanza Hybrid and Green Goliath 
are a quintet of winning broccoli varieties. In addition, Romanesco is an 
unusual Italian broccoli with a head that resembles a clump of individual 
swirls of light green sea coral and features a sweet, delicate flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Cauliflower 
</P>
<P>
Referred to by gourmets as the "prince of the cole crops," cauliflower is 
prized in this country for its pristine white heads. To get those pure white 
heads you have to blanch them: After the heads begin to form, tie the leaves 
over the heads to prevent exposure to the sun. When the heads are exposed to 
the sun, they turn yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Like broccoli, cauliflower plants should be spaced 18 inches apart. Harvest 
cauliflower when the heads are tight and smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Early Snowball A, Snow Crown Hybrid and Snow King Hybrid are a trio of top 
cauliflower choices. If you like the unusual, Purple Head Improved is a unique 
type with a dramatic purple head that turns green when cooked; it requires no 
blanching. 
</P>
<P>
Brussels Sprouts 
</P>
<P>
Brussels sprouts are produced along the stalks of large, unusual looking 
plants. The sprouts, similar to tiny cabbage heads, develop from the bottom of 
the stalk upwards. 
</P>
<P>
It is not unusual for each plant to produce 100 or more sprouts. Because of the 
large plant size, Brussels sprouts transplants should be spaced two feet apart. 
Jade Cross Hybrid, Jade Cross E Hybrid and Oliver Hybrid all produce well in 
the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Kohlrabi 
</P>
<P>
This unusual looking member of the cole family is grown for its bulbs, which 
are produced on the stems above the ground level. Kohlrabi is not a popular 
vegetable among home gardeners, but it should be. It is fine table fare whether 
eaten raw or cooked and is extremely easy to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Kohlrabi is seldom available as a transplant. It is the most rapid of the cole 
crops to mature, reaching the harvest stage about 50 days after the seed is 
sown. Follow the directions on the seed packet for correct spacing. Grand Duke 
Hybrid is by far the best kohlrabi variety. 
</P>
<P>
Collards 
</P>
<P>
Collards have long been a favorite vegetable in the South and are gaining 
popularity in gardens throughout the country. Rich in vitamins and with few 
calories, the cooked leaves taste somewhat like cabbage, but have a stronger 
mustard flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Collard transplants should be spaced 15 inches apart. Harvest leaves as you 
need them and let the rest of the plant continue to grow. Choose either Georgia 
or Vates; both grow well here. 
</P>
<P>
Kale 
</P>
<P>
Probably the least well-known of the cole crops, kale is unusually rich in 
calcium and other minerals. The plants make attractive landscaping items, and 
nurseries will often feature different varieties of ornamental kale grown for 
garden display. 
</P>
<P>
They are beautiful plants, covering a range of pastel colors. Keep in mind, 
however, that ornamental kale varieties are not primarily designed for table 
fare. While most are edible, they are not nearly as succulent as those 
varieties bred for eating. Dwarf Blue Curled Vates is the best edible type for 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Full sun and a rich, porous soil are necessary for cole crops. Lots of compost, 
redwood shavings or other organic matter should be spaded into the soil. All 
cole crops are heavy feeders and need a complete fertilizer. Water deeply and 
allow soil to settle a few days before planting. 
</P>
<P>
Seed packet directions should be adhered to when sowing seeds. Transplants 
should be buried a little deeper to encourage sturdy stems. 
</P>
<P>
Because the cole crops like water, they should be irrigated deeply between 
rains. Liquid fertilizer applied every three weeks will produce significantly 
bigger crops. 
</P>
<P>
Only cabbage worms are a serious problem during the cool months, but they can 
be easily controlled with a biological spray, that contains Bacillus 
thuringiensis. Products such as Dipel, Thuricide and Attack all contain this 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds or transplants for many of the varieties listed here should be available 
at local nurseries. Seeds for others may be ordered by mail from Burpee Seeds, 
Warminster, Pa. 18974. They offer a free catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week: 
</P>
<P>
Keep fertilizing your lawn on a regular basis. This will help keep it greener 
longer into the cooler season. 
</P>
<P>
Repot older root-bound cacti and succulents. Look for roots peeking out of the 
drain holes. 
</P>
<P>
Look around this fall at what trees are changing leaf color and pick your 
favorite to plant for a color show of your own next year. 
</P>
<P>
As the leaves fall off your deciduous trees, keep them picked up. They harbor 
diseases, and insects love to hide in the decaying foliage.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: BUILD A SOLAR HEATER TO DRY FRUIT CHEAPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We would like to dry (preserve) fruits and vegetables that we buy on 
sale and some from our own garden. Is there any way to use solar heat to dry 
them instead of heating up our kitchen by using the oven? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Preserving fruits and vegetables by drying is a prefect match with 
solar energy. Drying is the most natural and most nutritious method to preserve 
foods. Dried food takes up very little space and lasts a very long time. Using 
heat from the sun is free and it does not create any pollution or contamination 
of the environment or your food. 
</P>
<P>
You should be able to build an inexpensive solar food dryer yourself, using old 
scrap materials you may already have around your house. The savings in buying 
larger quantities of fruits and vegetables on sale should easily pay back its 
cost in one summer alone. A typical-sized dryer will preserve a 20- to 30-pound 
load of produce in about two days. 
</P>
<P>
The key to an effective solar food dryer is designing it to maintain a moderate 
temperature, about 110 degrees, in the dryer. There must also be adequate air 
circulation in it and around the food to carry away the moisture-laden air. 
</P>
<P>
One effective design of a solar food dryer is basically a large open-top 
plywood box. For the top, use an old storm window with a solar collector plate 
immediately under it. This flat black collector plate absorbs the sun's heat, 
yet blocks its direct rays from striking the food. Direct sun causes food to 
lose its color and much of its nutritional content. 
</P>
<P>
Build the plywood box with screen-covered vent holes in the top and the bottom 
ends. The hot, moist air naturally exhausts out of the top vent, thus drawing 
cool, dry air in the bottom vent. It is important to properly size the vent 
holes, or there may be too much or too little air flow to keep the dryer at the 
proper drying temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Attach legs to the box to tilt it up from horizontal at an angle equal to your 
area's latitude angle. This faces it most directly toward the fall and spring 
sun. Attach the shelf supports on the interior sides so they are level when the 
box is tilted up. 
</P>
<P>
Make the screen-covered shelves slightly smaller than the length of the shelf 
supports. Then stagger every other shelf flush against the back of the box. 
This forces the warm air to wind back and forth across all the shelves to get 
to the top outlet. 
</P>
<P>
Once you become familiar with your solar food dryer, you will learn to adjust 
the interior temperature by tilting the dryer higher or lower and adjusting 
optional small movable vent covers. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 198 showing do-it-yourself 
instructions and diagrams and a material list for making a solar food dryer. 
Please include $1.25 and a self-addressed business-size envelope. Send your 
requests to James Dulley, c/o Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, 
Cincinnati, Ohio 45244.

NEW KIDS LEAVE TOWN A LITTLE POORER AFTER THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With hundreds of frenzied young fans screaming farewells, the pop band New Kids 
on the Block left town Saturday with a bang -- but without $100,000 cash that 
was reported stolen along with their manager's briefcase, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Amid a near mob scene at the Bel Age Hotel in West Hollywood, someone allegedly 
stole the briefcase from the group's business manager, James Rossi, 25, at 
mid-morning Saturday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Rossi was checking out when he set his briefcase on the floor, only to discover 
it missing a few minutes later, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said they were uncertain why Rossi had so much cash, and he could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
About nine hours before the theft, deputies had to clear the hotel lobby of a 
crowd of about 200 to 500 teen-age girls. Many fans followed the group to the 
hotel after a Friday night concert at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here three years," said hotel weekend manager Talia Levin, "and I've 
never seen anything like this. It's just like the Beatles all over again."

LONG BEACH POLICE KILL SUSPECT WHO TOOK GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who was being arrested on a cocaine charge in Long Beach grabbed a police 
officer's gun and opened fire before officers shot and killed him, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man was identified Saturday by police as Darnell Campbell, 27, of Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
One of the officers, Kevin Peterson, was injured slightly in the leg in the 
Friday incident. 
</P>
<P>
Police originally were responding to a report of a gun-wielding man seen in an 
alley when the owner of a body shop approached the officers and said someone 
was trying to steal a car, Detective Dennis Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins gave this account: 
</P>
<P>
Officer Mark Hansen found Campbell sitting on a curb, smoking a cocaine pipe. A 
scuffle broke out when Hansen tried to arrest Campbell. Another officer, 
Peterson, saw the fight and tried to help when Campbell grabbed Hansen's gun 
from its holster and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson was knocked to the ground and Campbell was standing over him with the 
gun when two other policemen arrived. They opened fire, killing Campbell.

SHARPTON TELLS GANGS VOTES CONTROL TURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling on gang members to control their turf not with guns, but votes, the 
controversial Rev. Al Sharpton of Brooklyn announced a plan Saturday to forge a 
new political power from Los Angeles' mean streets by registering 25,000 youths 
and gang members for the November election. 
</P>
<P>
"If they really want to control their turf, they have to vote," Sharpton said 
at a press conference Saturday at the Biltmore. "Just to tell them to be 
goody-goody is silly. They have to feel involved and part of the system." 
</P>
<P>
The plan to register 25,000 minority youths will partly rely on a series of rap 
concerts at which the only price of admission will be registering to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpton was joined at the press conference by Rev. Charles Mims of Los 
Angeles, who has been active in organizing "peace summits" between warring 
gangs; Lenora B. Fulani, the independent New Alliance Party gubernatorial 
candidate in New York, and Elizabeth Munoz, the Peace and Freedom Party 
candidate for California governor. 
</P>
<P>
The press conference followed several days of talks with gang members in Los 
Angeles. Six former or active gang associates appeared with Sharpton on 
Saturday and registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpton rose to national notoriety three years ago when he served as a close 
adviser to Tawana Brawley, the black teen-ager whose claim of being raped by a 
group of whites in the town of Wappingers Falls, N.Y., was rejected by a New 
York grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpton's flowing, shoulder-length hair, glistening gold chains and booming 
rhetoric became frequent fixtures in newspaper and television reports, 
transforming him overnight into one of the nation's most popular objects of 
both ridicule and applause. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters once dubbed him "Reverend Sound Bite" for his theatrical, 
attention-getting statements. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Brawley case, the 35-year-old, Brooklyn-born Baptist preacher without 
a pulpit has continued to startle and infuriate with demonstrations attempting 
to shut down the Miss America Pageant because of poor living conditions in 
Atlantic City, N.J., and to close the Statue of Liberty to mark the 27th 
anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to register gang members in Los Angeles is part of a national program 
to involve minority youths in the political process that he already has started 
in New York City and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"Really controlling your turf means walking into a councilman's office and 
saying, 'I've got 10,000 votes here,' " he said.

FRACTURE ADDS TROUBLE FOR GWYNN 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ATLANTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A difficult season got worse for the Padres' Tony Gwynn Saturday night when he 
fractured the tip of his right index finger while trying to catch a ball off 
the right-field wall at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres won the game, 5-3, in the 11th inning after blowing a 3-1 lead in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn left the game immediately after running into the wall while attempting to 
run down what wound up being a double by Atlanta's Jeff Treadway in the third 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn was taken to a hospital, where X-rays revealed the fracture. A Padre 
spokesman said Gwynn would fly to San Diego today for further examination. 
</P>
<P>
The injury followed the 1990 pattern for Gwynn, who has been struggling at the 
plate with a .310 average -- about 20 points below his career mark -- and has 
been unhappy with what he believes has been unwarranted criticism of his 
playing style by several teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went up, I slammed my hand against the wall and cracked the tip of it," 
Gwynn said. "I don't know where I'll go from here. I think it's something I can 
play with once the swelling goes down. I don't think it's serious. I expect to 
be back in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
If his season were to end here, his .310 average would be his lowest since 
1983, when he hit .309 after starting the season in Las Vegas. Gwynn conceded 
two weeks ago that his string of consecutive NL batting titles would be ending 
at three. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn was involved in all of the Padres' three runs in the third, driving in 
two with a triple and scoring on Joe Carter's single to make it 3-0. The two 
RBIs came in the nick of time, considering what happened a few minutes later; 
they gave Gwynn a career-high 72, one more than his previous season best. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta scored one run in the seventh off reliever Greg Harris after chasing 
starter Andy Benes. And things got worse for the Padres in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, Jeff Blauser hit a home run, his seventh, off Harris to make it 
3-2. The Padres then turned to closer Craig Lefferts, who one out later yielded 
another home run to Lonnie Smith, tying the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't recall any hits I've had off Lefferts," Smith said. "He's tough. He 
was trying not walk me, so he just laid one in." 
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh blown save opportunity of the season for Lefferts. But he 
wound up with his seventh victory instead when the Padres rallied in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
Benito Santiago led off with a single off loser Jeff Parrett, the fourth Brave 
pitcher. Mike Pagliarulo sacrificed, and Joey Cora sent Santiago to third with 
a single, chasing Parrett. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lynn drove in Santiago with a single up the middle off Tony Castillo, and 
after Bip Roberts was intentionally walked, Garry Templeton provided a cushion 
with a groundout to second that scored Cora. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony made the right pitch and got the ground ball," Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox 
said. "But Lynn's ball found the right spot." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Show got the last three outs for his first save since 1982. That extended 
his string of remarkable success against the Braves, adding to his 18-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually the Braves have hit me harder than anyone else this year," said Show, 
who is 2-0 against them in 1990. "They've got more home runs off me this year 
than anyone else has. My record against them is just luck." 
</P>
<P>
In the 10th inning, Carter and Padre Manager Greg Riddoch were ejected by 
umpire Jerry Lane for protesting a called third strike. It was Riddoch's first 
ejection, which gave Lane a string of sorts against the Padres. He also handed 
Gwynn his first major league ejection last season in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Andy Benes has not had a decision in his past four starts and has 
not won since Aug. 24. . . . Ron Gant needs to score five more runs to become 
the first Brave to score 100 or more since Dale Murphy (115) in 1987. . . . The 
Braves are second in the National League with 98 home runs.

CARSON HAS REASON FOR HIRING EX-JET AIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Returning Sunday to Giants Stadium to stand across the carpet from the 
strangers wearing Jets green is bound to be an odd sensation for Browns Coach 
Bud Carson and four ex-Jets assistants. It will be like visiting an old home 
and being surprised at the changes made by the new tenants and maybe even a 
little sad at the thought of what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
Carson and assistant head coach Dan Radakovich left the Jets a year ahead of 
the broom that swept out former Coach Joe Walton and the rest of his staff at 
the end of last season. Without those two to prop up Walton, the Jets collapsed 
in a 4-12 heap, while Carson and Radakovich ended their season in the AFC 
championship game at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Walton and most of his '89 assistants scattered on the four winds to 
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New England, Phoenix and San Diego. Three are out of 
the NFL. But Carson hired three other coaches who shared the Jets' foxhole with 
him: quarterbacks coach Zeke Bratkowski, defensive coordinator Jim Vechiarella 
and defensive backs coach Mike Faulkiner. 
</P>
<P>
While Carson's hirings have been criticized by some as an example of the 
old-boy network in the NFL, a closer look would show the five ex-Jets now with 
the Browns formed the nucleus of a very talented coaching staff hired by 
Walton. It's not difficult to imagine how much different things might have 
turned out for the Jets if Walton had been dismissed two years earlier and 
Carson promoted to the head job. 
</P>
<P>
The record shows Walton had three losing seasons (18-30) without Carson and 
Radakovich and a record of 35-27-1 when they were on his staff from 1985-88. 
The arrival of Carson and Radakovich probably saved Walton's job after he took 
over a team that went to the AFC title game following the 1982 season and had 
two straight 7-9 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely, it turned the team around," Radakovich said recently. "We went to 
the playoffs the first two years. But like anywhere else, you run out of 
players or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
The Jets ran out of whatever it is that causes talent and coaching to mix in 
just the right way to produce a winning record. That's the combination Carson 
was trying to put together when he added Bratkowski, Vechiarella and Faulkiner. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a case of going out and hiring every guy you like, although a 
lot of people have accused us of that," said Carson, who has 13 assistants. 
"It's chemistry I'm interested in -- whether people work well together and how 
they work together on game day, what they do on the practice field. Are they 
on-field coaches, off-field coaches? That's what I'm interested in." 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived in Cleveland, offensive coordinator Marc Trestman already was 
in place. But Carson assumed greater control by firing Trestman and making over 
his staff with a distinct Jets flavor. "Bud interviewed other coaches," 
Radakovich said, "but he thought they were the best people available for the 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, some strong bonds were formed while they were with the Jets. "Bud, 
Zeke and 'Vech' lived together for about two years in Point Lookout," said 
former Jets quarterback Pat Ryan, who spent some time in the Browns' training 
camp this summer. "They sat up and talked football plenty of times. They're a 
tight group." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL coaching fraternity is a small world, and some of the ties that bind 
the ex-Jets go back even further. Carson and Radakovich spent time together 
with the great Steelers of the early '70s, as well as the Rams and Jets. 
Vechiarella coached with Carson for the Rams, Chiefs and Jets, and Bratkowski 
and Carson endured a year of 0-8-1 hell under Frank Kush with the Colts in 
1982. When Walton promoted Faulkiner to defensive backs coach with the Jets, it 
was Carson who served as his mentor. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkiner, who also is an excellent talent scout, offered these sketches of his 
fellow assistants: 
</P>
<P>
Radakovich: "He doesn't like to admit it because he likes to coach linebackers, 
but the best thing he does is coach the offensive line." Injuries and 
retirement have destroyed the Browns' line, which means "Bad Rad" faces a big 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Bratkowski: "He's very low-key but fundamentally sound. I think you'll see an 
improvement with Bernie Kosar, even though he's been in the playoffs five years 
in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Vechiarella: "He was an excellent defensive coordinator with good schemes at 
Tulane with Larry Smith. When Smith went to Arizona, he used Vech's defense, 
and it helped him get the USC job." 
</P>
<P>
As for himself, Faulkiner knows his strength is in how he relates to people. "I 
was as honest as I could be with guys, but I also had fun with it," said 
Faulkiner, whose needle was extremely sharp and punctured many an ego. 
</P>
<P>
Developing an understanding of each other is vital to the success of a coaching 
staff. During the football season, it's as though they are in a dark bunker 
with their videotapes and chalkboards, emerging into the light only on Sunday 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's assistants know they are working for an ex-Marine whose emotional ups 
and downs can be difficult to handle. But they accept his style because they 
know he's a brilliant coach who gets results. 
</P>
<P>
"Bud's record speaks for itself," said Faulkiner. "I haven't seen him change as 
a head coach. He has the title, but he's the same Bud." 
</P>
<P>
In 17 previous NFL seasons, Carson has been with 12 playoff teams, including 
eight division winners, three teams that reached the Super Bowl and two that 
won it. Although Walton sometimes argued with Carson over which personnel to 
keep in the game, he was smart enough to give him free rein to run the defense. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the job Carson did camouflaged the Jets' weaknesses. Faulkiner 
recalls the Jets' 8-7-1 record in 1988 when the defense had 45 sacks and 24 
interceptions while starting two rookies and a converted wide receiver in the 
defensive backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't that good," Faulkiner said. "I think Joe put a lot of pressure on 
himself last year. He thought we were going to win 10 games. We got off to a 
bad start, and things snowballed." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Faulkiner had an argument with Walton in which the two almost 
came to blows before Faulkiner stalked out. That was a moment he regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"Walton let the coaches do their job," Faulkiner said. "I look back at that 
blowup and hope it didn't have anything to do with us being run out. I hope the 
organization didn't say, 'The coaches are losing it."' 
</P>
<P>
The record will show that one man lost control, but when that man is at the 
top, everybody goes down with him. Then, they all move on. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the survivors with the Browns won a game against the Steelers, 
whose offense is under Walton's command. This Sunday, the band of ex-Jets 
recruited by Carson visits a place they used to call home. They won't recognize 
it.

AMERICAN LEAGUE HAS HOTTER BATTING RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ROSENTHAL, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National League batting race boils down to Len Dykstra vs. the Ghost of 
Willie McGee. It's fascinating enough imagining a leader in the clubhouse -- 
the Oakland clubhouse -- but for sheer contrast, the American League race is 
even more of a fan's delight. 
</P>
<P>
There's Rickey Henderson, the only leadoff hitter alive who can hit 26 home 
runs. There's George Brett, the only player alive who can win batting titles in 
three decades. And there's Rafael Palmeiro, the only man alive who ... well, 
he's the darkhorse candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Palmeiro, though, is the purest hitter of the three, according to Orioles 
hitting instructor Tom McCraw. Brett is "a blue-collar hitter" who is 
absolutely lethal with the game on the line. And Henderson embodies every 
scout's dream, the combination of power and speed. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that stands out to me with Rickey is his power," McCraw said. "He's 
not your typical leadoff hitter. Palmeiro, his swing is sweet. It's smooth like 
velvet. It glides. It's effortless. 
</P>
<P>
"When I think of Brett, he's like an assassin. Brett kills you. He's so clutch, 
he's the guy that drives that stake into you, that breaks your back. You know 
it. He knows it. And there ain't a damn thing you can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
Brett, 37, is seeking to become the third oldest player to win a batting title. 
Ted Williams won at the ages of 39 and 40 -- he hit .388 in 1957, .329 in '58 
-- and Honus Wagner was an older 37 when he hit .334 in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
Brett's 4-for-4 Wednesday night -- including not one but two triples -- brought 
him into a tie with Henderson at .327. Palmeiro looms just a hit or so back at 
.324. 
</P>
<P>
The Amazing A's left for Boston, New York and Seattle with a 6 1/2-game lead, 
then increased the cushion to 11 by going 8-1. Defense remains the most 
underrated feature of this team: Oakland made one error the entire trip. 
</P>
<P>
Each victory was by three or more runs. Dennis Eckersley earned only one save 
and appeared in only three games -- the same number as rookie Steve Chitren. 
"For the time of year, that's got to be as good a road trip as I've ever been a 
part of," Manager Tony La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sanderson earned three of the victories, and the A's scored 23 runs in 
those games. He has 16 wins as the replacement for Storm Davis, who had 19 last 
year. The A's are the only team in the majors that have used the same five 
starters all season -- Sanderson, Dave Stewart, Bob Welch, Mike Moore and Curt 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City, the team that was supposed to challenge them, has tried 15, the 
latest being the immortal Hector Wagner (and let's not forget Mark Davis, who's 
7-10). San Francisco, the team it beat in the '89 World Series, has tried 14. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Jeffrey Leonard will earn $1 million guaranteed in 1991 if he makes 
550 plate appearances this season; otherwise, the club can buy him out for 
$150,000. The latter appears likely: Leonard has started only twice since Aug. 
26, and is stuck on 501 plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Cotto started over Leonard against a left-hander Tuesday even though he 
was in a 5-for-53 slump. Manager Jim Lefebvre used 16 position players 
Wednesday in a 9-3 loss to Oakland, but Leonard wasn't one. You'd never know he 
has 10 hits in his last 19 at-bats and is tied with Ken Griffey Jr. for the 
club lead with 67 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre points to Leonard's poor second-half production (.227-0-12) as the 
reason for his reduced playing time, saying he's had "chance after chance." The 
fact is, the Mariners likely will move Pete O'Brien to left next season to make 
room for Tino Martinez at first. Leonard, who turns 35 a week from tomorrow, no 
longer fits their plans. 
</P>
<P>
First the Mets got Davey Johnson fired, now they're chipping away at Bud 
Harrelson, whose latest crime is chiding his players for "too much cockiness." 
Harrelson apparently wants the Mets to return to first place before they resume 
their trademark arrogance. The nerve. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there's a well-chronicled school of thought that the Mets lost their 
edge after trading in-your-face players like Len Dykstra, Kevin Mitchell and 
Wally Backman. "We used to have guys who'd high-five you in the dugout and 
almost knock you over," Dwight Gooden said. "Now we just shake hands." 
</P>
<P>
"I used to love the way we treated other teams," Darryl Strawberry said. "We 
didn't care at all what they thought of us. We liked it more if they hated us. 
We'd sit in the dugout and just (curse) them. We'd say anything. Nothing was 
off-limits. We were a little crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Only in Boston would a player say it's "easier" on the road when his team has 
the best home record in the league. But that's exactly the word left fielder 
Mike Greenwell used to describe the hidden advantage of a 10-game road trip 
that began Thursday night in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wade Boggs couldn't understand the pessimism triggered by the injury 
to Roger Clemens. "You pick up the papers around here, and they're starting to 
write us off," Boggs said. "A lot of players resent that. Roger is one-fifth of 
the pitching staff. There are four other guys. I don't feel like it's a 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Boggs, by the way, needs 26 hits in his final 18 games to become the first 
player to reach 200 in eight straight seasons. The irony of the great AL 
batting race is that he is not even involved. Boggs and Alan Trammell are tied 
for fourth in the league with a .311 average. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland outfielder Candy Maldonado just turned 30, and he's batting .273 with 
20 homers and 85 RBI. He might be the type of hitter the Orioles pursue this 
winter, if they're indeed serious about free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado, however, is hinting that he will be loyal to the Indians. One, they 
offered him an $825,000 contract after he batted .217 for San Francisco last 
season. Two, he credits much of his success to the hitting coach Jose Morales. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of your opinion of Frank Robinson, his adherence to the Orioles' 
rebuilding plan is an underrated aspect of his performance as manager. Just 
this week, Nick Leyva drew heat in Philadelphia because of his impatience with 
young players. 
</P>
<P>
Leyva's frustration is understandable -- the Phillies had a six-walk inning 
Thursday, a 12-walk game last Saturday -- but it's September, and his team is 
in fifth place. General Manager Lee Thomas shouldn't have to chew him out for 
yanking young pitchers too quickly, as he did after Tuesday's 5-1 loss to 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Sportswriting hell is defined as covering the Cleveland Indians, which Sheldon 
Ocker has done the past 10 years for the Akron Beacon-Journal. Ocker is staying 
interested this season by keeping track of every visit pitching coach Mark 
Wiley makes to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
By Ocker's count, Wiley had taken his lonely walk 141 times through Aug. 31. 
For what? The Indians were 33-56 in games he visited a pitcher. After he left, 
the next hitter was batting .333 with an on-base percentage of .448. Wonder 
what the Orioles did under Wiley in 1987? 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee is 7-18 on Sundays and holidays. Robin Yount is hitting .165 in those 
games, Rob Deer .145. "We have a civil-service approach to baseball on Sundays 
and holidays," Manager Tom Trebelhorn explained. "We don't feel like we should 
be at the office." 
</P>
<P>
How about the timing of John Wathan's one-year extension in Kansas City? "I 
don't know if there's ever been a manager rehired in the middle of a nine-game 
losing streak," he said. "Somebody might want to check with the Elias Sports 
Bureau to see if it's a record of some sort."

STEINBERG IS ENDING THE JETS' ISOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

If you're planning to attend the Jets' home opener Sunday against the Browns, 
it would be a good idea to buy a program. Otherwise, you might have trouble 
determining the players. This isn't the same team that trudged off the field 
last Dec. 23 after being blown out by the Bills, 37-0, in the season finale. 
The 1990 Jets have 21 new players -- a 45 percent turnover from last season's 
4-12 team. 
</P>
<P>
As the large turnover attests, the Jets have been aggressive in acquiring 
players by means other than the draft. This represents a new philosophy for the 
Jets. As a result, their image around the NFL apparently has changed. After 
years of being perceived as a team that operated in isolation, the Dick 
Steinberg-led Jets have returned to the mainstream, according to executives 
around the league. 
</P>
<P>
"With Dick running the show, they're going to be an aggressive team," said 
49ers vice president John McVay, echoing a common sentiment around the league. 
"You know that because that's the way he operates." Said Chiefs General Manager 
Carl Peterson: "Dick is plugged into the network, and you have to be to have an 
idea where to find players." 
</P>
<P>
Browns Coach Bud Carson, who spent four seasons as the Jets' defensive 
coordinator, said: "As I look at their starting lineup, about half of them are 
new faces. They've really got the franchise moving." 
</P>
<P>
Which is a far cry from the old-regime Jets, who employed a four-man football 
committee to call the shots, instead of a traditional general manager. 
</P>
<P>
One NFL source, who didn't want to be identified, described the old 
front-office situation, saying, "Obviously, they were out of it -- WAY out of 
it. It was a weird situation. (Former president) Jim Kensil didn't do anything. 
(Current president) Steve Gutman comes out of a business background, and he's 
fine at what he does, but he's not a football man. So it comes down to (former 
personnel director) Mike Hickey. The only problem with Mike is that he believed 
he was smarter and better than everyone else, so he was tough to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
When he was hired, Steinberg said the Jets projected a "mystique" in NFL 
circles. That's a polite way of saying no one in the league had a clue about 
what went on inside Weeb Ewbank Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, that has changed. If anything, Steinberg is plugged into the 
information network. During the off-season, he said he spent an average of five 
hours a day on the telephone. Obviously, this has made it easier for other 
clubs to deal with the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
"From an efficiency standpoint, it's a lot easier to call one individual who 
has control over all the areas you want to discuss, instead of calling three or 
four different people," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg has been active, that's for sure. All the moves may not pay off, but 
as Peterson said, "You can't make a football team better -- especially a 
rebuilding team -- without making moves." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 new players, seven are draft choices. That includes starting flanker 
Rob Moore, who was selected in the July supplemental draft. The Jets forfeited 
their 1991 first-round pick by selecting Moore, but so far it seems to be worth 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the draft, the Jets acquired players from a number of sources, 
including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trades. In the Jets' first player-for-player trade since the Matt Robinson 
trade in 1980 -- hard to believe, isn't it? -- the Jets sent rookie receiver 
Reggie Rembert (unsigned at the time) to the Bengals in exchange for linebacker 
Joe Kelly and tackle Scott Jones. Kelly immediately stepped into the starting 
lineup, while Rembert and Jones are on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg also unloaded underachieving fullback Roger Vick, a former No. 1 
pick, to the Eagles for an undisclosed pick. Two trades in a week. Amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Plan B. The Jets signed 12 ($720,000 in signing bonuses) and six made the 
team, including two starters -- tackle Brett Miller and tight end Mark Boyer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Waivers. They added needed linebacker depth by claiming Dan Murray, John 
Galvin and Troy Johnson. "We're a lot better at linebacker than we were at the 
start of camp," Steinberg said. "If Alex Gordon wasn't hurt, we'd feel 
comfortable at that position." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the moves, there's still work to be done. "The first and second years 
are frustrating," Peterson said. "You see the potential, and you want to get 
there, but there's only so many steps you can take at once."

TOREROS MAKE FOGARTY WINNINGEST USD COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
University of San Diego Coach Brian Fogarty is not one to talk much about his 
accomplishments, and he even gets a bit embarrassed when someone else does. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is why few people realized that Fogarty was about to become the 
winningest football coach in USD history. 
</P>
<P>
After Saturday night's 31-7 victory over Claremont in front of 3,244 fans in 
USD's Torero Stadium, Fogarty is just that, wresting the honor from his 
predecessor, Bill Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Two games into his eighth season, Fogarty is 35-33-2. Williams was 34-36-1 in 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know that was the case," Fogarty said. "I guess if you stay some 
place long enough, those things happen." 
</P>
<P>
That's not entirely true. Fogarty has done an admirable job recruiting fine 
student-athletes without the help of a scholarship lure, and he has made the 
transition to recruiting freshman instead of community college transfers. He 
also has established a fine, deceptive offense and a dominating aggressive 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
After going 15-24-1 in his first four seasons, Fogarty has gone 20-9-1 since 
the start of 1987. He has also won nine of his past 11 games, including seven 
in a row at USD. 
</P>
<P>
USD (2-0) has also defeated Claremont four consecutive years by a combined 
score of 101-35. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, USD did it with a running game that pounded out 262 yards. It 
did it with a controlled passing game that completed six of nine for 137 yards. 
And it did it with a defense that held Claremont to 159 total yards, only 15 in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
John Eck was the big-play man on offense for the Toreros. Triple-threat Eck ran 
for one touchdown, caught another one and added a 39-yard completion on a 
halfback option pass to Ty Barksdale. 
</P>
<P>
Eck finished with 86 yards rushing in eight carries and 54 yards in three 
receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Eck's two long touchdowns and a 42-yard field goal by Dave Bergmann gave USD a 
17-7 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
On the second play of USD's second possession, Eck broke free in the Claremont 
secondary after a play-action fake to him in the backfield, and Brendan Murphy 
hit him easily for a 41-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared I was going to drop it," Eck said. "I was so wide open." 
</P>
<P>
On USD's next play from scrimmage -- 49 seconds later -- Eck broke free on a 
counter play between right guard and tackle and rambled untouched 58 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"You could have driven a truck through there," Eck said. "I mean, I have no 
wheels, and if I could score on that, anyone could." 
</P>
<P>
As for the halfback pass, Eck was a quarterback at Carson High before coming to 
USD. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 19 minutes, USD limited Claremont to 66 yards in four 
possessions. That's when the Stags finally got things going, driving 80 yards 
in 13 plays covering 6:21. Reed Pangborn dived over from the one to cap the 
drive, and USD's lead was just 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
Bergmann, who had missed earlier on a 37-yard field-goal attempt, nailed a 
42-yarder from the right hash mark with no time remaining in the first half. 
The key play in the 42-yard drive, which started with 1:12 left, was a 31-yard 
pass from Murphy to senior Chris Redlew.

U.S. DISCUSSES WITH ALLIES NEW WAYS TO PUNISH IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration, encouraged by an international backlash against raids 
by Iraqi troops on Western diplomatic compounds in Kuwait, said Saturday that 
it is discussing with other countries new ways to punish the Baghdad regime for 
its actions. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to consult with France and our other friends on further possible 
steps to bring home to Iraq the costs of its aggression, including tightening 
of the sanctions in all possible ways," the White House said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Although White House spokesman Sean Walsh declined to elaborate, analysts said 
the discussions are likely to include a proposal by French President Francois 
Mitterrand to impose an air blockade against Iraq. Another possibility would 
involve some form of sanctions against nations that help Iraq evade the 
international embargo. 
</P>
<P>
The White House statement came as the U.N. Security Council, at France's 
request, prepared for an emergency session in response to the forcible entry of 
Iraqi troops at the French, Canadian and Belgian embassy compounds on Friday 
and at the Netherlands compound earlier last week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. officials delivered to Iraq a videotape in which President Bush 
offers his view of the Persian Gulf conflict to the Iraqi public. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also tried to resolve internal differences on the scope of a 
proposed sale of U.S. arms, possibly worth as much as $23 billion, to Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
A planeload of 285 former U.S. and Canadian hostages arrived at 
Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Among those aboard was a 
25-year-old bank employee who was released after his mother sent a personal 
plea to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
A flight carrying a second group of former hostages is scheduled to arrive at 
the airport today. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials, seeking to stress the international opposition to Iraq's 
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, strongly approved of France's decision to add 4,000 
soldiers to the defense forces in the Persian Gulf and to evict from Paris 
Iraq's military attaches and other Iraqi personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"We welcome France's decision to contribute substantial additional forces, 
including ground troops, to the international effort in the gulf," the White 
House said in its statement. "This decision is further evidence of the 
determined and unified international will to resist Iraq's blatant aggression 
and violations of international law." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush spent the day at his mountain retreat at Camp David, Md., where 
he signed into law a bill authorizing an expansion of the nation's strategic 
petroleum reserve to 1 billion barrels from its current cap of 750 million 
barrels. The law allows the government to lease crude oil from producers and 
keeps the reserve in operation for four more years. 
</P>
<P>
One day after Iraqi troops in Kuwait forced their way into diplomatic compounds 
of France, Canada and Belgium, a group of about eight diplomatic personnel 
remained inside the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait city without electricity and cut off 
from outside supplies. State Department spokesman Mark Dillon said their 
situation has not changed. Despite the continuing presence of Iraqi soldiers 
outside, there was no word of any advances on the American compound, Dillon 
said.

The Administration, meanwhile, was preparing to submit to Congress an 
extraordinary list of weapons it wants to sell to Saudi Arabia, including F-15 
fighter planes, tanks and other sophisticated arms to bolster the kingdom's 
long-term security. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Walsh said the arms sale proposal is being worked on by a 
task force of representatives from the Defense, State and Commerce departments 
and had not yet been forwarded to the White House. "They would all have their 
recommendations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, U.S. Embassy officials in Baghdad delivered the President's 
videotaped message to the Iraqi public to Iraq's undersecretary of foreign 
affairs, Nizar Hamdun. Iraq has promised that it will allow the tape to be 
broadcast on state-owned television, but the timing of the transmission is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has announced that if it's not broadcast within five days, it will be 
released to the media," said a spokesman for the State Department's Kuwaiti 
Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions involving further action against Iraq are expected to include a 
possible air blockade to prevent goods from entering or leaving Iraq by plane 
in violation of the international trade embargo. Both Libya and Yemen are 
believed to have allowed such flights. 
</P>
<P>
An air blockade "is being debated now," a senior Arab diplomat in Washington 
told The Times last week. While acknowledging that such an escalation of the 
trade embargo would involve potential dangers, the diplomat estimated that it 
would be effective in 8 out of 10 cases because many pilots would refrain from 
trying to evade an air blockade. 
</P>
<P>
"Why? Because four of those eight won't go because they know perhaps it's 
dangerous," he said. "And the other four, you can prohibit them in the airports 
if you can identify them, say, in the airports." 
</P>
<P>
The talk of tougher economic sanctions comes amid signs that the existing 
sanctions have been taking a toll. There were reports Saturday that Iraqi 
troops in Kuwait, short on food as a result of the embargo, have eaten many of 
the animals in the Kuwaiti zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The White House also applauded recent announcements by France, Canada, Belgium, 
Italy and Britain that they will bolster their military forces in the Persian 
Gulf with additional combat troops, fighter planes, tanks and ships. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the latest French deployments, the White House statement declared: "We 
consider such steps appropriate and justified in view of Iraq's continued 
infringement of diplomatic conventions covering the presence of foreign 
embassies in Kuwait."

U.S. WAR PLAN IN IRAQ: 'DECAPITATE' LEADERSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: THE JOINT CHIEFS BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO OUST THE IRAQIS WOULD BE AIR 
STRIKES DESIGNED TO KILL HUSSEIN.

<TEXT>
<P>
If the United States and Iraq go to war, the U.S. military plans to unleash a 
relentless air campaign designed in part to "decapitate" the Iraqi leadership 
by targeting President Saddam Hussein, his family, his senior commanders, his 
palace guard and even his mistress, according to senior U.S. military planners. 
</P>
<P>
A recently completed Joint Chiefs of Staff targeting review concludes that the 
most effective way to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait is not with a ground 
attack, but through the use of massive air strikes to kill Hussein and decimate 
his war-making capacity by destroying scores of critical military and 
industrial sites. 
</P>
<P>
The Joint Chiefs publicly acknowledge that U.S. ground forces in the region, 
which currently number about 100,000 soldiers and Marines, are not sufficient 
to dislodge the 265,000 Iraqi troops and 2,200 tanks now in and near Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Air power is the only answer available to our country in this circumstance," 
Air Force Chief of Staff Michael J. Dugan said after touring U.S. air bases on 
the Arabian Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan would not divulge whether U.S. officials know the precise whereabouts of 
Hussein or members of his inner circle, nor would he say whether senior Bush 
Administration officials had signed off on the plan to target them in an air 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
An air strike deliberately aimed at the Iraqi president and members of his 
family could prove controversial because attacks on civilian leaders are 
generally considered out of bounds, even in wartime. 
</P>
<P>
The United States bombed Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi's home and other targets 
in Tripoli in 1986, but Kadafi escaped serious injury. U.S. officials defended 
the raid as an effort to punish and deter terrorism, but a number of nations 
condemned it as a violation of international law. 
</P>
<P>
To support the U.S. war plan in the Persian Gulf, which revolves around the 
massive use of air power, the Air Force alone has ringed Iraq with an air 
armada of 420 combat planes, nearly equal to the fleet dedicated to defending 
Europe against the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the United States has 1,000 Air Force, Marine and Navy aircraft poised 
to strike Iraq from three aircraft carriers and 30 bases in the region. The 
available facilities are so taxed that even if the United States and its allies 
wanted to bring substantially more aircraft into the region, they could not, 
Air Force officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Dugan and his senior deputies, in several hours of interviews on his 
aircraft traveling to and from Saudi Arabia, said that U.S. military commanders 
from all services agree that air power is the best option for defeating Hussein 
and his million-man army. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see us making a big (ground) invasion" of Kuwait, Dugan said, noting 
that attacking forces generally need a three-to-one advantage in manpower to 
dislodge an entrenched defensive force. 
</P>
<P>
To attempt to beat Iraq on the ground risks "destroying Kuwait in order to save 
it," Dugan said. 
</P>
<P>
By using air power against targets in Iraq, on the other hand, "you would 
attempt to convince his population that he and his regime cannot protect them," 
Dugan said. "If there is a nation that cannot defend its people against these 
intruding foreigners -- protect their lines of communication, their means of 
production, their cities -- that brings a great burden for their ruler." 
</P>
<P>
Dugan, a fighter pilot with more than 4,500 flying hours and 300 combat 
missions in Vietnam, acknowledged that air power has its limits. One cannot 
predict how a population or its leaders will respond to a bombing campaign, he 
and other Air Force officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can air power drive people out of jungle sanctuaries, Dugan said. "But 
there's not much jungle where we're going. You don't have to get within a few 
yards to attack them, intimidate them, kill them." 
</P>
<P>
The effect of air power can be diluted, even negated, by constraints placed 
upon its use by civilian leaders, senior Air Force officials noted. Most Air 
Force officers believe to this day that if they had been allowed to bomb North 
Vietnam without limits the United States would have won the war. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan said that American political authorities had learned from Vietnam and 
would approve unfettered air strikes against a broad range of Iraqi targets. 
"This wouldn't be a Vietnam-style operation, nibbling around the edges. The way 
to hurt you is at home, it's not out in the woods somewhere. We're looking for 
centers of gravity where air power could make a difference early on," Dugan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There is a long and bitter debate among military officers and historians 
outside the Air Force over the utility of strategic bombing. While air power 
advocates argue that the bombing campaigns against Germany and Japan won World 
War II, that contention is still in question. Many officers contend that only 
"ground pounders" -- the infantry -- can take and hold ground and ultimately 
end a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
But, the Air Force chief argued, "Air power, in peace and war, brings a special 
kind of psychological impact. . . . I would not argue that air power alone can 
be decisive. But air power is irreplaceable and absolutely essential." 
</P>
<P>
The current Persian Gulf war plan calls for an intense allied air campaign, 
probably beginning at night, to quickly establish absolute air superiority, 
officials said. The immediate military targets, in order, would be air defense 
installations; airfields and aircraft; ballistic missile launchers; 
communications, command and control centers; munitions depots; arms production 
plants, including chemical, biological and nuclear weapons facilities, and 
concentrations of tanks and other armor. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Air Force officials said they would like to take the fight to 
Baghdad, to central command centers, to Hussein's suspected redoubts and to 
other targets specifically chosen to break the Iraqi spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"Hussein would realize very shortly into hostilities that he wouldn't have his 
air power over the battlefield. Then it's all over. It's a matter of how much 
pain you want to take before you quit," said Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas R. 
Ferguson, commander of the Aeronautical Systems Division. 
</P>
<P>
The primary targets are predictable military objectives, but wars are not 
usually won by blowing up airfields and bomb factories, Dugan explained. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a nice list of targets, and I might be able to accept those, but that's 
not enough. I want to know what is unique about Iraq. What is unique about 
Iraqi culture that they put very high value on? What is it that psychologically 
would make an impact on the population and the regime in Iraq?" Dugan asked. 
</P>
<P>
He said that about two weeks ago he assigned a team to find Iraqi military 
defectors, knowledgeable professors, Iraqi expatriates and journalists who 
recently have visited Baghdad to learn more about Iraqi culture and the mind of 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that effort, Dugan said "a better list" of high-value targets in 
Iraq was developed. The list stressed the importance of attacking Hussein and 
his inner circle, but beyond that, Dugan would not detail the potential Iraqi 
leverage points he intends to try to destroy. 
</P>
<P>
If an attack is ordered, the full Air Force arsenal would be brought to bear: 
B-52s, Stealth attack planes, F-15E ground attack fighters, F-111s, F-16s, F-4G 
anti-radar jets, A-10s, all carrying the latest armament. The battle would be 
coordinated at central command headquarters and a number of tactical control 
stations in the field, all receiving data from AWACS, RC-135s, RF-4s and other 
reconnaissance aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Several B-52s have been equipped with a new Israeli 50-mile-range cruise 
missile known as Have Naps, and the Air Force has requested accelerated 
delivery of hundreds more of the highly accurate weapons, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy and Marine Corps air and sea power -- as well as forces from numerous 
other nations who have joined the United States in Saudi Arabia -- would also 
be used to suppress Iraqi air defenses and destroy the 550-plane Iraqi air 
force, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the time required to accomplish the mission vary. Some pilots 
assert that the job can be done in a matter of hours; more circumspect 
commanders plan on several days to as long as two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The optimism, some might say arrogance, about the superiority of allied air 
power stems from several key assumptions about the Iraqi air force, its weapons 
and its tactics. U.S. officials discount the quality of the force based on its 
performance in the eight-year Iran-Iraq War, saying that Iraqi pilots bombed 
from 20,000 or 30,000 feet and often missed their targets by that much. 
</P>
<P>
They also contend that Iraqi pilots, largely trained and equipped by the 
Soviets, are heavily dependent on ground controllers and aren't allowed the 
lethal "free play" practiced by American fighter pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the Air Force intends to locate and destroy the Iraqi ground control 
stations and leave their pilots blind. The Air Force has deployed four RC-135 
electronic intelligence-gathering planes in Saudi Arabia to locate these 
installations and eavesdrop on all kinds of Iraqi voice and data 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
The RC-135s, modified Boeing 707s jammed full of sophisticated computers and 
electronics gear, have traditionally been used to gather strategic intelligence 
on the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Dugan said "it won't take very many minutes" to destroy the Iraqi air force -- 
if the planes come up to challenge American pilots. But he and other officials 
acknowledged that the Iraqis could be troublesome for many weeks if they 
disperse their planes and send them up in small numbers to harass allied 
fighters. There is already some evidence that Hussein has ordered his aircraft 
moved to widely separated airfields to avoid being destroyed on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi missiles, too, could present an "irritant" if the Iraqis conceal them and 
launch them in small numbers, the general said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to tell you we won't lose airplanes, but it's a manageable risk," 
said Lt. Gen. Jimmie V. Adams, Air Force deputy chief of staff for plans and 
operations. "We have wall-to-wall, no-kidding fighter pilots in Saudi right 
now."

MIDWEST TRIES TO GET KICKS SUPPORTING NEW ROUTE 66; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THIS TIME IT WOULD BE AN INTERSTATE. IT WOULD LINK 'FORGOTTEN 
CITIES' BYPASSED BY FREEWAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stirring memories of motor courts and blue-plate specials, of Okie caravans, 
Burma Shave signs and quarter-a-gallon gas, a group of Midwestern businessmen 
and politicians are trying to gather support for construction of a new Route 66 
across the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it would be called Interstate 66 and, stretching from northern 
Virginia to central California, it would be the first coast-to-coast interstate 
highway to be undertaken in more than three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting a new trail across the country, I-66 would not go through Joplin, 
Oklahoma City, Amarillo, Gallup or any of the towns celebrated in the famous 
road song with the jaunty refrain, "Get your kicks on Route 66." 
</P>
<P>
Advocates are calling the proposed interstate the highway to America's 
"forgotten cities" -- places such as Paducah, Ky., Cape Girardeau, Mo. and 
Trinidad, Colo., towns that were bypassed by the golden era of freeway building 
during the 1950s and are now slowly losing population and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Oklahoma boosters who conceived of the original Route 66 in the 1920s, 
promoters of I-66 see it as a means of stimulating tourism and business 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a project like this one would help give the nation's heartland 
a new lease on life," said Glen Dockery, special assistant to the mayor of 
Wichita, Kan., and head of the group pushing for the new highway. 
</P>
<P>
While Dockery and his associates appear to have generated a lot of enthusiasm 
along the proposed route, they still have a long road to hoe. Officials of the 
Federal Highway Administration say the I-66 project is not a top priority, and 
environmentalists do not warm to the prospect of a six-lane superhighway that 
would cross some of the most pristine landscape in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates indicate the freeway would cost $20 billion in federal 
taxpayer dollars and take 20 years to complete. In an age when the federal 
government does not have enough money to repair many existing roads, the idea 
of building a new interstate highway may strike a lot of people as folly. 
</P>
<P>
Final approval hinges on the willingness of states along the route to spend 
their federal and state transportation money and on federal approval of design 
and environmental safeguards. If the project requires special financing, 
congressional approval would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
Project sponsors, including about 25 cities along the route, have already made 
headway. They have formed an association, Interstate 66 Project Inc., hired 
consultants and lobbyists, produced a promotional videotape and recently 
persuaded the House of Representatives to appropriate $1.5 million for a 
feasibility study that would determine the exact route. The Senate is now 
considering the funding proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In at least one state along the route, New Mexico, state officials have begun 
holding town meetings to discuss the project's merits. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed interstate has aroused interest in California, where San Joaquin 
Valley officials in Kern and Fresno counties say they would get behind the 
project if it is likely to boost local economies. Promoters of I-66 insist that 
it would. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing we are trying to sell about this project is that it would 
link local economies closer together with the national economy," said Walter 
Wildman, director of the Regional Commerce and Growth Assn. of Southeast 
Missouri and one of the architects of the I-66 project. 
</P>
<P>
"In California, we're offering the possibility of transporting all the produce 
out of the San Joaquin Valley to the Midwest a half-day to a day quicker than 
what can be done on the existing routes." The routes Wildman was referring to 
are Interstates 70 and 40, the two east-west interstates closest to the San 
Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere along the route, in Appalachia and Colorado's San Luis Valley, some 
of the nation's poorest and most isolated agricultural regions would gain new 
access to major markets on the East and West coasts as well as the Midwest, 
according to Wildman. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the I-66 project have not charted a precise course across the 
country, but they have drawn a 50-mile-wide corridor. Passing through nine 
states, this corridor crosses a stand of rural America inhabited by about 12 
million people, where the largest cities include Fresno, Wichita, Lexington, 
Ky. and Huntington, W. Va. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed I-66 corridor begins in California near the juncture of Interstate 
5 west of Fresno and extends east across the Sierra Nevada into southern 
Nevada. It straddles the Arizona-Utah boundary, passing into New Mexico and 
southern Colorado and on to southern Kansas and Missouri. It crosses the 
Mississippi River into southern Illinois, through central Kentucky and West 
Virginia, and into western Maryland and northern Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the new construction would occur along the western two-thirds of the 
route. Eastward from Kentucky, roadwork would involve improving and connecting 
existing limited access highways. I-66 already exists as a 65-mile stretch of 
limited access freeway from Washington, D.C. to western Virginia, where it 
could merge with the transcontinental route. 
</P>
<P>
On its way across the country, the I-66 corridor passes through 13 national 
forests, 11 national parks, five game preserves and five Indian reservations. 
Sequoia National Forest, Death Valley, Grand Canyon, Zion National Park, Mesa 
Verde National Park and Great Sand Dunes National Monument are along the 
proposed route. 
</P>
<P>
Project sponsors say that they are aware of the many natural wonders along the 
route and insist that they can build the six-lane interstate with a minimum of 
intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
"If you remember back in Eisenhower's days when they decided to build the 
interstate system, they didn't ask anybody, they just built them," Wildman 
said. "We aresavvy enough to know that in order to build anything of this 
magnitude today, you're going to have to be extremely sensitive and responsive 
to environmental concerns. It's not going to make it easier, but we feel very 
strongly that's the way it should be." 
</P>
<P>
Where the road builders and environmentalists are likely to clash is over the 
notion that there is merit to bringing more people and commercial development 
closer to nature. 
</P>
<P>
"The corridor would make many of the country's most isolated national forests, 
national parks, archeological sites, and areas of natural scenery available to 
our population," states a 30-page consultant's report commissioned by I-66 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Although final approval by the federal government of I-66 may be a long way 
away, environmental groups are already making their objections known. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we would have a lot of serious concerns about opening up areas that 
are archeologically rich, especially on the Indian reservations and in the 
southern part of Utah, northern part of Arizona that have been protected by 
their very remoteness now," said Robert Smith, southwestern representative of 
the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
"With a major project like a freeway goes the assumption that there will be 
little trailer towns and associated industries, businesses that grow up along 
those that would be a lot better stuck in an existing transportation corridor," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The I-66 project grew out of the local concerns of a string of towns in 
southern Missouri and southwestern Kentucky. Officials there believe that a 
superhighway could merge isolated communities, where unemployment often runs 
into double figures, into busy metropolitan corridors. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line of this whole effort is to create an economic condition that 
when our children graduate from high school and have the option of staying here 
or not, they don't feel like they have to go to a larger city to make a 
living," Wildman said. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in the proposed interstate spread westward and two years ago, Wildman 
said, 75 local officials and business leaders met in St. Louis and established 
a project committee. 
</P>
<P>
While they work to drum up support as far west as Fresno, the Missouri- and 
Kansas-based architects of the I-66 project acknowledge it is their part of the 
country that stands to gain the most. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Midwestern area, perhaps more than any other, that will benefit most 
from the linking of major rural producing areas with major urban and rural 
population centers," says the narrator of an I-66 videotape that is being 
circulated along the route. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the national case for I-66 is being made in Congress by Rep. Dan 
Glickman (D-Kan.), who argues that in 20 years -- the time it would take to 
build I-66 -- traffic on the two other east-west interstates could be nearing 
gridlock. Glickman and other proponents of the new road argue that it could 
reduce traffic on I-40 and I-70 by about one-third and reduce accident rates by 
up to 20% by removing a significant amount of truck traffic. 
</P>
<P>
If the new east-west interstate makes a lot of sense to Glickman and his 
constituents back in Wichita, they still have to make a convincing case to 
federal highway administrators. Although officials there say they will study 
the idea if Congress sets aside the money, they do not believe that traffic on 
Interstates 40 and 70 warrants building a new highway. 
</P>
<P>
If there are going to be new additions to the nation's 42,000-mile interstate 
system, at least two other proposed routes make more sense, said Kevin Heanue, 
executive director of planning for FHA. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two would go from Shreveport, La., to Kansas City; another from St. 
Louis, Mo., to St. Paul, Minn., Heanue said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, federal highway officials say interstate planning is becoming more 
decentralized and if the states along a proposed route want to build a new 
interstate, they can. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it works now, the highway program is a federal aid program to the 
states and it's the states who decide what to build," said Anthony Kane, 
associate administrator for engineering at FHA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

A group of Midwestern businessmen and politicans are proposing construction on 
a new highway-to be dubbed Interstate 66-that would span the continental United 
States. Advocates say the highway5446982291952998688

SOME AIDS VICTIMS WIN BLOOD CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a significant outgrowth of the AIDS epidemic, hundreds of people who 
contracted the deadly disease through blood transfusions are seeking solace in 
court -- and the $2.5-billion blood-selling industry is worried that the legal 
backlash could be financially devastating. 
</P>
<P>
A small number of these medical negligence cases have been settled for large 
amounts of money, and another 300 lawsuits nationally are poised for trial, 
mostly in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles, places where the epidemic 
has hit hardest. 
</P>
<P>
This is only the beginning, say legal experts, who expect thousands of cases to 
clog the courts in the next few years as more people discover that they were 
given tainted blood during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"These awards are far higher than in other types of cases because the jury 
tries harder because of the disease, because they have all personally felt that 
fear," said attorney Duncan Barr, who has successfully defended San Francisco's 
Irwin Memorial Blood Bank in several cases. 
</P>
<P>
In Arizona, a 5-year-old boy whose parents claimed that he was given an 
unnecessary blood transfusion recently was awarded $28.7 million -- believed to 
be the largest such award -- and there have been several other jury verdicts in 
the $12-million range. 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross, which collects half the U.S. blood supply, will not 
comment on how many lawsuits have been filed against it over allegedly tainted 
blood transfusions. "To release those figures would create more mischief," said 
one official. 
</P>
<P>
James MacPherson, of the Blood Council of Community Blood Centers, said that 
most centers were insured only for $2 million to $5 million a year for the 
years in question. If they run out of insurance, they will have to dig into 
reserves, increase costs of blood sales or perhaps go bankrupt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While it has been eight years since the first medical reports made connections 
between transfusions and AIDS, legal cases are only surfacing now because of 
the lag time between becoming infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, 
which causes AIDS, and onset of physical symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 26 million people received transfusions between 1977 and 1985 -- 
years when the AIDS epidemic exploded. 
</P>
<P>
In the latter 1980s, blood banks and hospitals took steps to ensure safer 
blood, but scientists disagree on the chances of contracting AIDS today through 
transfusions. Some place the number as low as one in 500,000, others as high as 
one in 50,000. Since 1985, when blood banks began testing for the HIV virus, 
only 12 new cases of AIDS have been reported to have been contracted through 
transfusions, federal statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 143,500 known to have contracted AIDS nationally, the federal 
Centers for Disease Control reported that 3,351 adults and 238 children have 
developed the disease through blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
Another 1,258 hemophiliacs have developed the disease through blood-based 
clotting medicine, and it is estimated that 12,000 more have tested positive 
for HIV because of the medicine. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, health officials said 194 adults and 36 children have 
contracted AIDS through transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
According to legal experts, the outcome of the impending courtroom battles 
could hinge on the question of how well informed the medical community was in 
the 1983-85 period as to the risk of the HIV virus in the blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs have argued that the blood banks, fearing loss of donors and money, 
ignored scientific warnings about the threat of HIV-contaminated blood, failed 
to screen out high-risk donors through confidential questionnaires that 
identified high-risk behavior, and refused to perform tests for other diseases 
that were often present in HIV-infected donors. 
</P>
<P>
The medical profession, they contend, failed to advise patients that they could 
use their own blood or that of acquaintances instead of taking a chance with 
the general blood pool. 
</P>
<P>
They also failed to warn patients that blood transfusions could be deadly, 
plaintiffs contend. 
</P>
<P>
The blood banks, hospitals and many doctors have said that there was a lack of 
scientific evidence about the AIDS threat to the blood supply at the time. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a central issue in the blood-transfusion lawsuits has been, "Who 
knew what, and when did they know it?" said Fred Meis, a San Francisco attorney 
who is litigating 20 cases, including several against Irwin Memorial -- the 
city's major blood bank. 
</P>
<P>
In some of the first lawsuits, jurors found it difficult to find fault with the 
blood banks, generally viewing them sympathetically. "They are like God, the 
flag and apple pie," one attorney said of the blood banks. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the blood banks seemed to have the law on their side. Courts in 48 
states have held that blood is a "service" and not a "product." As a result, 
blood centers have been generally protected from liability suits, forcing 
plaintiffs to sue on other legal grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Barr noted that blood banks have fared well because "the overwhelming view of 
juries has been that the blood banks were doing everything they could to keep 
the blood supply safe." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, as more trials unfold, the trend seems to be turning toward 
plaintiffs, according to Michael Moriarty, a San Francisco attorney who in 1988 
paved the way for other suits by winning the first verdict in the country in a 
blood-transfusion case. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of this turnabout, he and others pointed to several large verdicts 
garnered recently, and to the blood banks' willingness to settle cases before 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a period of blood-bank bashing," said Bruce Chadwick, national 
counsel for Washington-based American Red Cross. "Yes, there were people who 
became AIDS-infected, that is true. But no one in the blood banks wanted that. 
These are people who devote their lives to trying to do good, save lives." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Gostin, director of the Boston-based Assn. of Law and Medicine, which 
tracks these cases, said that jury awards "tarnished the blood banks' 
reputations and the public confidence in them." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the first cases of its kind locally and only one of a handful 
nationally, a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury last month awarded an 
AIDS-stricken girl $3.01 million. The jurors unanimously agreed that the 
doctors failed to properly advise the family of the AIDS risk in blood 
transfusions. The hospital was faulted because one of the doctors was its 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles chapter of the American Red Cross, which provided the blood to 
the hospital and denied any negligence, settled its portion of the suit out of 
court two days before the trial. The settlement was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the girl had received a pint of blood during non-emergency heart 
surgery at Los Angeles Childrens Hospital. The operation to repair a congenital 
heart defect was a success. Three years later, it was discovered that a man who 
had given blood to the Red Cross had contracted AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-year-old child was one of several people who received his blood, 
subsequently tested positive for the HIV virus and today, with the first 
symptoms of the disease emerging, she is being treated with AZT, a drug that 
has been shown to slow the development of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs alleged that one of the doctors told the mother there was only a 
"one in a million" chance that blood could be tainted. At the time, the risk 
was known to be much higher, the family's attorney said. Attorneys for the 
hospital and doctors would not discuss the case, pending an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The case illustrates several dynamics of these lawsuits: When the cases reach 
juries, plaintiffs often are perceived to be, as one medical expert put it, 
"innocent victims." Also, juries look most sympathetically at children who have 
contracted AIDS, then look for someone to blame. Conversely, drug users and gay 
men who have tried to prove that partners were negligent generally have not 
been as successful before juries. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite the large awards, those who have had their day in court say 
that there are really no winners. The mother of the Los Angeles girl, who asked 
to remain anonymous because she feared social ostracism of her daughter, 
explained: "I was partly happy when we won the case. It means when she needs 
medicine and care I can buy it for her. But even though we won the case, in the 
end I will still lose her." 
</P>
<P>
Although a small number of blood banks were taking all safety measures 
available at the time, most did not allow recipients to choose donors, screen 
them for high-risk lifestyles and provide a test for the hepatitis B core 
antibody, which was thought to be effective in identifying groups at risk for 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the 4-year-old Los Angeles girl, Superior Court Judge Diane 
Wayne ruled that the plaintiffs had not presented enough evidence to sue the 
local Red Cross on allegations that it failed to adequately screen prospective 
blood donors. However, she allowed the plaintiff to sue the Red Cross for 
negligence in not providing hepatitis B testing and for failing to warn about 
the risks in the blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
The stricken girl's attorney, Martin M. Berman, said the blood banks have had 
an advantage on the issue referred to as "standard of care" -- what type of 
care is generally being provided in the medical community at the time. Several 
appellate courts across the country have ruled that hepatitis B testing was not 
standard treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Blood bank officials agreed that they ignored the advice and fought 
introduction of these tests because they were inconclusive or too costly, or 
because they feared losing donors. They insist that they were doing the best 
they could under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick, the attorney for American Red Cross, explained the thinking at the 
time: "There was tremendous controversy and great scientific debate on whether 
. . . tests would make good sense or cause more problems than good." 
</P>
<P>
Also, the blood banks and medical community have argued that they knew very 
little about AIDS in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Some intriguing legal side issues are also arising from the AIDS 
blood-transfusion cases. They include whether the anonymous donors who infected 
the blood supply can be identified and forced to testify, and whether the 
federal health agencies can be forced to allow their scientists to be called to 
the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
Several attorneys in San Francisco, who are handling 20 cases among them, have 
banded together to try to require key government scientists to provide one-time 
court depositions that they could all use in their legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Blood banks have generally refused to reveal donors, arguing that it would 
violate the physician-patient privilege of confidentiality, the donor's right 
to privacy and statutes limiting release of AIDS test results. 
</P>
<P>
With large jury awards expected to continue, blood banks and others are looking 
for ways to deal with the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
MacPherson, head of the Blood Council, said his group and others are looking at 
creating a federally aided no-fault compensation fund, similar to those that 
are set up to protect obstetricians against negligence suits in some states or 
those that compensate vaccine victims. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the American Red Cross recently announced that it will bring its 54 
regional offices under tighter control to ensure a safe blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
"Our blood banks failed us, the blood industry failed us, the Centers for 
Disease Control failed us, and the Food and Drug Administration failed us," Dr. 
Marcus Conant, a professor at UC Medical Center in San Francisco, told a House 
subcommittee hearing on blood safety last month. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the Paul Gann Blood Safety Act took effect this year. Named 
after the late anti-tax crusader who said he received AIDS-tainted blood 
through a transfusion, the act requires the medical profession to tell patients 
about blood-donor options, such as using one's own blood or asking 
acquaintances to donate. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics are not reassured by such changes. 
</P>
<P>
Gostin, director of Assn. of Law and Medicine, said that last year, Los Angeles 
doctors confirmed the first West Coast case of infection with a variant AIDS 
virus called HIV-2. It first surfaced in West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
European blood banks have begun testing blood for this new virus, but U.S. 
public health officials have not, saying that 60% to 90% of HIV-2 cases are 
detected with the standard test. 
</P>
<P>
"Is history repeating itself?" Gostin asks.

LOS PADRE'S FIRE SPOTTERS MAY FALL VICTIM TO BUDGET

<P>
Tom Fusek is one of a dying breed. 
</P>
<P>
From his perch 8,013 feet above sea level -- a tower near the border of Kern 
and Ventura counties -- Fusek keeps watch over the rugged ridges of Los Padres 
National Forest, scanning the horizon every few minutes, ready to radio 
firefighters at the first puffs of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
On a clear day, Fusek's 360-degree view includes the Sierra Nevada foothills, 
Bakersfield, Palmdale, the skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles and even 
Catalina Island. One time, he insists, he saw ships rounding San Pedro -- more 
than 85 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
But this summer could be Fusek's last season as a professional fire lookout. 
</P>
<P>
Although still widely used in remote parts of Northern California, the lookouts 
have become an endangered species in the state and national forests of Southern 
California, phased out by budget cuts, technology, urban sprawl and smog. 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting few and far between," said Don Trammell, district recreation 
officer at Los Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Once the backbone of the U.S. Forest Service's fire-fighting network from Kern 
County to the Mexican border, lookout towers have been on the decline in 
Southern California for more than 20 years. The last towers in the Angeles 
National Forest, which covers more than 600,000 acres of Los Angeles County, 
were closed about eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lookouts watch over Los Padres from only three of the area's seven remaining 
towers -- Fusek's 54-year-old wooden tower at Frazier Mountain, about seven 
miles west of Gorman, and two others near Big Sur. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County still operates two of its 
seven towers and the San Bernardino National Forest, using volunteers, keeps 
three towers open. A fourth tower in San Bernardino was reopened a few weeks 
ago -- with a paid lookout -- to stand guard over the forest during the hot, 
dry days of September. 
</P>
<P>
Of 65 lookout towers operated by the California Department of Forestry and Fire 
Protection, none is located in the 11 southernmost counties of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The wildlands are getting crowded," explained Karen Terrill, a department 
spokeswoman. "And when you've got a subdivision next door there's really no 
need for a lookout." 
</P>
<P>
Many fires are first seen by commercial and private pilots, forest officials 
said. In recent years, motorists have begun reporting fires by car phone. 
</P>
<P>
It costs up to $10,000 a year to operate the Frazier Mountain tower, and forest 
officials said financial considerations may force them to close the lookout 
after this fire season. 
</P>
<P>
Fusek conceded that, on some occasions, he has sounded alarms only to be told 
some camper or pilot reported the flames first. Even so, the Frazier Mountain 
tower and its commanding view can still mean the difference between a small 
fire and a devastating blaze, said Jim Smith, a fire management officer in Los 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
For Fusek, the tower is a serene retreat from city life. A tall and lanky 
native of North Hollywood who grew sick of traffic, smog and urban blight, 
Fusek turned his back on the city after graduating from Cal State Los Angeles 
with a geography degree in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
He worked as a welder, a laborer and a fire lookout in Sequoia National Forest 
before coming to Frazier Mountain in 1985. He lives in the tower's 
64-square-foot room five days a week, on watch from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., before 
returning for two days of rest at his home in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at peace with the world when coming down after five days," he said. "I 
feel more lonely in the big city. There's a difference between loneliness and 
solitude." 
</P>
<P>
At Frazier Mountain, the solitude is broken occasionally by a stray hunter or 
hiker. The hunters, Fusek said wearily, always ask the same questions: Have you 
seen any deer? Where are the deer? Have you seen any bucks? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he tells them. And that's part of the mountain's appeal. There are deer, 
coyotes, birds and, always, that inspiring view. 
</P>
<P>
The tower itself is rather shabby. A boxy wooden structure with peeling Army 
green paint, the tower was built in 1936 at Camuesa Peak in Santa Barbara 
County and then relocated after a forest fire destroyed the Frazier Mountain 
tower in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
It is equipped with a small bunk, a television set, a stove, and a contraption 
called the Osborne fire finder, the device Fusek uses to plot the coordinates 
of a fire. Taped to the side of the fire finder is a Far Side cartoon of a 
lookout, burned to a crisp, surrounded by untouched forest. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked behind the bunk is a small insulated stool Fusek stands on during 
electrical storms for protection. The closest lightning strike he ever saw hit 
a nearby electrical transformer. 
</P>
<P>
Fusek is supposed to scan the mountains every 15 minutes. But in reality he is 
always on guard and, while chatting with visitors recently, now and then 
shifted his eyes away to the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
The worst blaze in Fusek's career at Frazier Mountain was the Fishbowls Fire of 
1987, named for a campground several miles to the south. It was 11:50 a.m., 
Fusek said, when he casually glanced up and saw a blue-black plume. 
</P>
<P>
After reporting the fire, his work done, all Fusek could do was watch as 5,000 
acres were charred. "It's kind of a helpless feeling for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There's more to being a lookout than watching the horizon, he said. One must 
recognize the slight gradations of color and movement which distinguish a fire 
from dust devils or steam rising from a wet road warmed by the sun. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit, Smith reminded Fusek of smoke he reported seeing several 
days earlier. A helicopter flew over the sight and the spotter decided it was 
only steam. 
</P>
<P>
But two days later, a fire broke out in the exact spot, Smith said. The blaze 
had been smoldering. Fusek had been right after all. He nodded slightly with 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Fusek admitted later that he has mixed feelings about reporting fires. "To 
prove yourself, you want to see a smoke," he said. "But you don't want to see a 
big smoke."

Spitfires and Hurricanes from Britain's "finest hour" in 1940 joined with jets 
representing the country's Persian Gulf force on Saturday in a salute to the 
Battle of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The procession of 168 aircraft flew over Buckingham Palace, where Queen 
Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip were waiting on the balcony at noon. Also in 
the royal party was Prince Harry, son of Prince Charles, who was celebrating 
his 6th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola of Belgium, and Princess Juliana and Prince 
Bernhard of the Netherlands represented Britain's wartime allies. Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher and members of her Cabinet watched from another 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
The flight marked the 50th anniversary of the turning point of the battle. On 
Sept. 15, 1940, the Royal Air Force inflicted heavy losses on the Luftwaffe as 
it staged a daylight attack on the capital. Two days later, Adolf Hitler 
suspended plans for an invasion of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The 300 pilots and navigators were led by Air Vice-Marshal Bill Wratten, 
commander of 11 Group, which fought the Battle of Britain in the summer and 
autumn of 1940. Wratten piloted a Spitfire Mark 2 credited with shooting down 
three German aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Two Hurricanes and five Spitfires from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight 
led the cavalcade, which included the Red Arrow acrobatic team, a Lancaster 
bomber and some of the Tornado F3 jets like those deployed with the 
multinational forces in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
On the ground, there was a parade of 1,400 Royal Air Force, Royal Auxiliary Air 
Force, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, Royal Observer Corps, Air Training 
Corps and other groups escorting the standards of the 17 Battle of Britain 
squadrons still in operation. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian, Australian and New Zealand air forces also were represented. 
</P>
<P>
Also taking part were representatives of the Fire Brigade, Metropolitan Police 
and the Ambulance Service, which fought their own battles in 1940 against fires 
and explosions during the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 534 air crewmen -- one in six -- were killed during the battle and 
many others were seriously injured. The RAF lost 1,017 aircraft and Germany's 
Luftwaffe lost 1,882. 
</P>
<P>
After the battle, Winston Churchill paid his famous tribute to the victors: 
"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few." 
</P>
<P>
It was Britain's resistance to the German onslaught early in World War II that 
Churchill called the nation's "finest hour."

ENVOY REPORTS SOVIET OVERTURE TO ISRAEL

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ready to restore diplomatic relations 
with Israel after a 23-year gap if Israel agrees to participate in an 
international peace conference, Italy's foreign minister said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has made it clear that Israel would only 
consider taking part in an international conference limited to the Persian Gulf 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis met with Gorbachev a day after the Soviet 
president met with Israel's finance and science ministers. That meeting Friday 
was the first between a Soviet leader and Israeli Cabinet ministers since the 
nations broke diplomatic relations in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"President Gorbachev told me about the Soviet side's readiness to recognize 
Israel immediately if it agrees to participate in an international conference 
that would determine rules and principles for security and cooperation in the 
region," said De Michelis, whose country holds the presidency of the European 
Community. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 4, the Soviets proposed an international conference to discuss the 
Persian Gulf, the Arab-Israeli dispute and the Lebanese civil war. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the Soviet 
Union "might take a fresh look at the issue of Soviet-Israeli relations" if the 
Jewish state agreed to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has long opposed Soviet-backed ideas for an international conference 
over the Palestinian conflict, fearing such a wide forum would try to force 
Israel to concede territory to the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev met in the Kremlin on Friday with Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai and 
Science Minister Yuval Neeman, who were in Moscow discussing a trade deal. The 
meeting was not announced beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
Neeman said Saturday in Jerusalem that Gorbachev's warm reception of the 
Israeli ministers set the stage for establishing diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
"We are bringing home a new atmosphere," he said in a radio interview, adding 
that Israeli-Soviet relations had been "raised to a new level that, I assume, 
is the last before complete relations." 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Italy agreed to give the Soviet Union $2.72 billion in 
credits Saturday, one day after Gorbachev warned that his nation is in danger 
of bankruptcy. De Michelis announced the loans after meetings at the Kremlin 
with Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
For decades the Soviet Union was considered a good international credit risk 
because the government always promptly paid its import bills. But because of a 
widening trade gap the Soviets have fallen behind on payments and are seeking 
trade credits.

Government troops advanced through booby-trapped buildings and mined streets 
Saturday, seeking to capture a hospital building and gain a strategic edge in 
war-ravaged Jaffna, military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital is in the center of the rebel-held town and about a mile from 
Jaffna Fort, controlled by government troops that claim they defeated Tamil 
separatist guerrillas Thursday to end a three-month siege. 
</P>
<P>
The government, meanwhile, warned citizens of possible attack by Tamil forces 
in the northern Jaffna region, most of which is controlled by the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"Due to the success of the security forces in the Jaffna Peninsula, the (Tamil 
Tigers) hierarchy has instructed its cadres to attack civilians," said a 
defense ministry statement issued Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials did not say how far their men had advanced toward the 
hospital. But a senior officer said troops were under constant rebel fire and 
progress was slow because of mines buried in the streets and booby traps hidden 
in buildings along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Control of the hospital would give the Sinhalese-dominated government a major 
base in the town of 60,000 people and, more importantly, a chance to win 
support among residents by resuming medical services. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelmingly Tamil town 185 miles northeast of the capital city of 
Colombo has been a rebel stronghold since the separatist war against Sri 
Lanka's Sinhalese majority began in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But recent battles in the area and the rebel's strong-arm tactics of soliciting 
funds have sapped enthusiasm for the guerrillas' cause in Jaffna, visitors to 
the town said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 14,000 people have been killed in the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The government says 25 soldiers have been killed and at least 136 wounded since 
the siege on the 17th-Century fort was broken Thursday. It claims more than 100 
Tamil rebels have died. 
</P>
<P>
The Tamil office in London, however, denied the siege had been broken. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels seek political autonomy or independence for the Tamil minority, 
claiming Sinhalese discrimination in jobs, education and use of the Sinhala 
language. 
</P>
<P>
The Sinhalese, who comprise 75% of the nation's 16 million people, control the 
government and the military. 
</P>
<P>
Tamils account for 18% of the people who live in the island nation. Muslims 
make up 7% of the population.

ONCE-BANNED PALESTINIANS APPLAUDED IN JORDAN

Two Marxist Palestinians who were banned from Jordan for 20 years were greeted 
by loud applause as a conference of leftist and Islamic groups convened 
Saturday to demonstrate solidarity with Iraq's Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The participation of George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh underscored a growing 
alliance between Iraq and radical Arab factions that is alarming Western 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Habash is leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and 
Nayef Hawatmeh heads the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
Habash and other Palestinian leaders were kicked out of Jordan after the 1970 
civil war pitting PLO rebels against the Jordanian army. The war started when 
Habash's guerrillas hijacked three jetliners and blew them up in the Jordanian 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
Habash was welcomed back at the start of a three-day conference of Arab 
leftists and Islamic activists sympathetic to Iraq. They demand that the 
U.S.-led multinational force leave the Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein, considered a U.S. ally, has been tilting toward his 
powerful neighbor since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2. The king has said he 
opposes the occupation of Kuwait but wants an Arab solution of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech Saturday, Habash urged Washington to avoid double standards in 
dealing with Iraq's invasion and Israel's occupation of Arab territories. 
</P>
<P>
"We reject the U.S. principle of selectivity in dealing with the U.N. Security 
Council resolutions," Habash said in a speech, marked by ovations from the 
audience of about 150 delegates. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the invasion, Saddam Hussein said he would contemplate leaving 
Kuwait only if U.N. resolutions calling for Israel's withdrawal from occupied 
lands were implemented at the same time. Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza 
Strip, and the Golan Heights in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
His declaration threw many Palestinian leaders into his camp. Habash, who had 
been based in Syria, moved to Baghdad.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is willing to discuss Iraq's grievances 
with Kuwait if Baghdad's troops withdraw from the emirate, Italian Foreign 
Minister Gianni De Michelis said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
De Michelis told a news conference after talks with Gorbachev that the Soviet 
leader is prepared to launch an initiative to resolve the crisis, but this 
would hinge on an Iraqi withdrawal and the restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
"In this context, he believes that if Iraq agrees to this then it would be 
possible at a diplomatic level to discuss the issues raised by Iraq prior to 
the invasion," he said.

Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, has won the 
backing of six Arab countries for a peace initiative that might open the door 
to an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, according to a PLO official. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat discussed the plan with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian official said afterward there are grounds for optimism 
that a political solution can be found for the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the idea implies a softening of the Iraqi position and could 
indicate that Baghdad is willing to shift from its refusal to withdraw from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat, one of only three Arab leaders who have openly sided with Iraq, has 
been shuttling around Arab capitals trying to win support for a negotiated 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat's political adviser, Bassam abu Sharif, told reporters Saturday that the 
new plan provides for a step-by-step approach, with the gulf crisis to be 
tackled first and the rest of the Middle East problem later. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure would hinge on a commitment by the United States and the four 
other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to implement U.N. 
resolutions on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a linkage in principle. . . . We can start with the hottest problem in 
the Middle East, the gulf, but then have to be sure the next step will be 
dealing with Palestine," Abu Sharif said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Abu Sharif, Arafat has won backing in principle from Libya, 
Algeria and Yemen, as well as Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia.

A toddler fell to the bottom of a 12-foot narrow construction hole Saturday 
afternoon and firefighters, hampered by the danger of a cave-in, worked into 
the night trying to rescue him. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters broke through a layer of hard clay shortly after 9 p.m. in their 
efforts to dig a parallel shaft to rescue 20-month-old Kevin Davis from the 
hole at his family's home in southeast Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The shaft Kevin fell into is about 18 inches wide at the top and was to be 
filled with reinforced concrete for a remodeling project. 
</P>
<P>
Denver policeman W. C. Hoffman said the threat of a cave-in diminished after 
diggers finally broke through the clay that had slowed digging efforts 
throughout the night. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' parents, Tom and Lisa Davis, were talking to Kevin, trying to soothe 
him during the rescue effort. Oxygen was being pumped into the shaft.

'FINGERS CROSSED,' SHUTTLE COUNTDOWN STARTS AGAIN 
</P>

With time running out, the shuttle Columbia's countdown resumed Saturday for a 
last-ditch launch attempt to avoid another major delay for the leak-plagued 
astronomy mission. 
</P>
<P>
"We're keeping our fingers crossed," NASA launch director Robert Sieck said. 
"The team has worked hard (and) we're due to win one." 
</P>
<P>
With Columbia running more than three months behind schedule, Sieck said the 
space agency has only a few days to get the ship off the launch pad or the 
mission will be delayed until after a higher-priority, $750-million flight next 
month by the shuttle Discovery to carry the European Ulysses solar probe into 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is the planned launch of an unmanned Titan 4 rocket later this 
week, sources say, to carry a classified military satellite into orbit. Because 
NASA and the Air Force share military tracking equipment, rocket launches 
cannot be conducted much less than 36 hours apart. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping for the best, engineers restarted Columbia's oft-interrupted countdown 
at 1 a.m. Saturday, and if all goes well, the $2-billion orbiter and its 
seven-man crew will blast off at 10:28 p.m. PDT Monday to kick off a 10-day 
astronomy mission. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an 80% chance of good weather, NASA managers were hedging their bets on 
when Columbia might finally make it into orbit because of multiple fuel leaks 
and an electrical glitch that have combined to delay the mission. 
</P>
<P>
And even though engineers believe they have finally plugged all of Columbia's 
leaks, they say they will not know for sure until supercold liquid hydrogen 
rocket fuel is pumped back aboard the ship's external tank Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia skipper Vance Brand, 59; co-pilot Guy Gardner, 42; astronaut Robert 
Parker, 53, and civilian astronomer Ronald Parise, 39, were scheduled to fly to 
the Kennedy Space Center from Houston late Saturday for final preparations. 
</P>
<P>
Their crewmates -- John (Mike) Lounge, 44; Jeffrey Hoffman, 45, and astronomer 
Samuel Durrance, 46 -- planned to join them this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts are scheduled to spend 10 days in orbit aiming a $150-million 
suite of telescopes at especially violent stars and galaxies to learn more 
about the forces that shape the universe. Landing is planned for Sept. 27 at 
Edwards Air Force Base.

A Panamanian newspaper, sponsoring an offbeat essay contest on the "criminal 
acts" of deposed general Manuel A. Noriega, is offering the first-prize winner 
a free trip to the former strongman's drug trial in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
In a half-page announcement Saturday, the independent daily El Siglo solicited 
essays that "explain and detail the criminal acts of the deposed tyrant 
(Noriega) and his followers." 
</P>
<P>
The essay "could be accompanied by testimonies, photocopies, material evidence, 
films, documents and other types of evidence" explaining "the clearly criminal 
conduct of" Noriega and his followers, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important and vital topic for Panama. We expect the participation 
of many Panamanians who have personal and incredible stories concerning 
Noriega," said Carlos Singares, editor of El Siglo. Singares said that all of 
the stories would be published.

The United Auto Workers and General Motors continued to bargain Saturday toward 
a new contract covering 300,000 active workers in 33 states, after setting 
aside a strike deadline that passed at midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The pact would cover 3,500 Californians, including 3,200 in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators were hoping to reach an agreement before a scheduled meeting Monday 
of the union's 300-member GM bargaining council, called to vote on any new 
pact. Workers were told to report to work as usual "until further notice." Only 
one plant, in Bowling Green, Ky., had been slated to operate this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Although Canadian Auto Workers struck Ford of Canada at midnight Friday, 
bargaining continued Saturday and no work was halted because none of Ford's 
Canadian plants had scheduled weekend operations. 
</P>
<P>
Ford says a Canadian strike would begin crippling up to eight U.S. assembly 
plants within a week. Ford of Canada is the sole source of engines for the 
Lincoln Continental and base engine for the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury 
Cougar, for example. It also makes all of the windshields for Ford's F-series 
pickup truck, the nation's biggest selling vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Affected would be plants in Atlanta; Chicago; Detroit; St. Paul, Minn.; Wixom, 
Mich.; Lorraine, Ohio; Norfolk, Va., and Kansas City.

<P>
Recently rebuffed in his attempt to regain control of Lincoln Savings, Keating 
quit last month as chief executive of American Continental, Lincoln's former 
owner. The resignation came after a federal judge accused Keating of looting 
the now-insolvent thrift. The 66-year-old financier, who lives in Phoenix, says 
he's broke.

<P>
S&amp;L owner 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the highest of the high-fliers, Dixon, 50, was a real estate developer 
who bought control of tiny Vernon Savings in north Texas in 1982 and used it to 
finance a regal lifestyle. He pleaded not guilty to misusing thrift funds for 
campaign contributions and prostitutes. Was last believed to be operating out

RICHARD T. PRATT

<P>
Regulator

<P>
As Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman from 1981 to 1983, he urged 
deregulation and opened the way for questionable accounting methods that 
disguised thrifts' true condition. Now says he regrets what he did on the

<P>
Regulator

Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board from 1983 to 1987, Gray sounded 
the alarm about the thrift crisis, but few listened. Viewed as a hero by some, 
a bumbler by others. Gray, 55, is now president of a savings and loan in Miami.

<P>
M. DANNY WALL 
</P>
<P>
Regulator 
</P>
<P>
The last chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, Wall quit in March under 
mounting criticism from Congress for his handling of the thrift crisis. Accused 
of badly underestimating the scope of the S&amp;L crisis, Wall, 51, now works 
out of his Virginia home as a consultant and speech-maker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DONALD T. REGAN 
</P>
<P>
Government official 
</P>
<P>
Former treasury secretary and chief of staff under President Reagan, he was a 
strong free-market advocate who cared little for the thrift industry. His 
philosophy of deregulation for the S&amp;Ls prevailed. Regan, 71, has homes in 
Virginia and Florida, and spends his time writing, lecturing and managing his 
investments.

<P>
JIM WRIGHT 
</P>
<P>
Politician 
</P>
<P>
After 34 years in Congress, Wright resigned as House Speaker last year after 
being accused of repeated ethics violations. Wright interceded with federal 
regulators in an effort to delay a government seizure of Vernon Savings. A 
resident of Ft. Worth, Wright, 67, is writing a book on Central America.

The former House majority whip abruptly resigned from Congress in 1989 after 
failing to disclose a $50,000 loan from now-insolvent Columbia Savings in 
Beverly Hills. He used the loan to purchase a junk bond. Coelho, 47, is now a 
managing director of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., a New York investment-

George Hardy, a California labor leader who unionized previously ignored 
janitors, public employees and health care workers during his 50-year career 
with the Service Employees International Union, has died. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy died Thursday night of respiratory failure at Children's Hospital of San 
Francisco, the union announced. 
</P>
<P>
From 1971 until his retirement in 1980, Hardy served as international president 
of the 935,000-member union. He was also a vice president of the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of thousands of workers, who might be blocked from organizing to this 
day were it not for George, have lost a true champion," said John Sweeney, who 
succeeded Hardy as president. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a janitor who rose to be SEIU vice president, Hardy was born in 
Vancouver, Canada, but moved to San Francisco with his family in the 1920s. He 
began his own career as a janitor but was soon blacklisted by groups opposed to 
his organizing activity. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy moved to Los Angeles in the 1940s as a union organizer. 
</P>
<P>
He achieved some notoriety in 1947 when he was arrested for threatening to 
punch John Roosevelt, son of the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt and then 
manager of Los Angeles' now defunct Grayson stores. The incident occurred as 
Roosevelt walked by a picket line marshaled by Hardy at Roosevelt's store near 
7th Street and Broadway. Charges were later dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted by prominent people, Hardy was as likely to tell off Presidents as to 
punch out store managers. At a 1975 economic summit, his colleagues laughingly 
recall, he told President Gerald R. Ford: "Quit fooling around!" 
</P>
<P>
Hardy was elected international vice president of the SEIU in 1948 and soon 
thereafter turned his efforts from janitors to health care and public service 
workers, who had been ignored by most unions. 
</P>
<P>
During Hardy's first four-year term as president, SEIU membership grew by 
100,000, mostly in the health care and public sectors. Before his retirement, 
Hardy helped lay the groundwork for the merger of the SEIU and the National 
Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, which was ratified in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy's wife, Cissy, died earlier this year. He is survived by a daughter, Joan 
Twomey, and two grandchildren, of San Francisco.

PENALTIES, INJURIES SINK TITANS DOWN SOUTH;

<P>
FULLERTON: QUARTERBACK PAUL SCHULTE HURT, SITS OUT SECOND HALF OF 27-13 LOSS TO 
MISSISSIPPI STATE.

<TEXT>
<P>
There was no talk of moral victories in the Cal State Fullerton locker room 
Saturday night after the Titans' 27-13 loss to Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike last week's 38-17 loss to Southeastern Conference power Auburn, a 
feel-good game for the Titans because they played well in the second half and 
weren't completely embarrassed by the nation's third-ranked team, Fullerton 
found little solace in its second loss to an SEC school in eight days. 
</P>
<P>
What made this defeat less palatable than last week's was that, although it 
wasn't a game they should have won, it was a game they certainly could have 
won. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 22,240 in Scott Field was stunned to see Fullerton take a 13-6 
halftime lead, but the Titans collapsed in the third quarter, succumbing to 
several mistakes, penalties and one costly turnover. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs scored 21 points in an 8 1/2-minute span of the second half, 
saving face for their school and the mighty SEC, considered one of the nation's 
strongest football conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Two pass interference penalties on consecutive plays accounted for 30 of 
Mississippi State's 80 yards on a scoring drive that cut Fullerton's lead to 
13-12 midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Tony James returned a punt 51 yards for a touchdown to give the Bulldogs a 
20-13 lead with 5:32 left in the third. It was the first time the Titans had 
allowed a punt to be returned for a touchdown since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
And Fullerton receiver Richard Harrison's fumble after a 34-yard catch was the 
impetus for Mississippi State's last scoring drive, which culminated with Tony 
Shell's 14-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Bouldin. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton freshman quarterback Terry Payne, in relief of injured starter Paul 
Schulte, led the Titans on two long drives in the second half but couldn't 
reach the end zone, as the Titans fell to 1-2. Two Fullerton possessions ended 
with fourth-down incomplete passes, one from the Bulldog nine-yard line and one 
from the 25. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have won, no doubt about it," said Payne, who completed 11 of 22 
passes for 139 yards. "Last week, we were supposed to be outscored, 55-0, and 
we did pretty well. This week, we had the game plan to win and we didn't. 
That's disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans could have pointed to several factors that might have contributed to 
the loss. They played the second half without Schulte, who completed 6 of 10 
passes for 136 yards in the first half before re-injuring his collarbone late 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
They also played without starting cornerback Nuygen Pendleton, who has a 
sprained ankle, and two starting linemen, John Cotti and Tim Drevno, who were 
slowed by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, on the way to Starkville, the Titans were stranded for six hours 
in the Nashville airport because of thunderstorms. What was supposed to have 
been an 11-hour journey from their Fullerton campus to Mississippi turned into 
a 17-hour trek. The Titans missed a scheduled practice Friday and didn't arrive 
at their Columbus, Miss., hotel until 11:45 p.m. (CDT). 
</P>
<P>
"But fatigue is just an excuse, not the reason we lost," Fullerton Coach Gene 
Murphy said. "We were outslept, though." 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State seemed to doze through the first half and the Titans took 
advantage, using a trick here and a few kicks there to take a 13-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State scored first on Joel Logan's 22-yard field goal in the first 
quarter, but J.J. Celestine returned the ensuing kickoff 45 yards to give 
Fullerton good field position. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte hit a wide-open Harrison on a post-pattern for a 43-yard gain to the 
Bulldog 14 and, four plays later, Nevin lined up for an apparent 22-yard 
field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
But holder Bob Baiz took the snap, rolled to his right and pitched a shovel 
pass to Teddy McMillan, normally an inside linebacker, for a three-yard gain 
and a first down at the Mississippi State two. Yarbrough scored on the next 
play for a 7-3 Fullerton lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Nevin kicked a 27-yard field goal after a 71-yard drive 
to give the Titans a 10-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Logan's 33-yard field goal made it 10-6, but the Titans drove from their 25 to 
the Bulldog 30 in seven plays, the last an 18-yard pass from Payne to Celestine 
with three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was out of timeouts, but while the clock stopped for officials to 
advance the chains, the Titans got their field-goal unit in position, and Nevin 
kicked a 47-yarder just before the halftime gun. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was a little stunned at halftime -- we didn't plan on being behind," 
Mississippi State Coach Rockey Felker said. "But we showed a lot of character 
coming back in the second. Maybe it helped us to fall behind like that because 
it made us fight and scratch to come back and win." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that seemed to hold the Bulldogs back in the first half was the 
inaccuracy of Shell, the senior quarterback who missed several open receivers. 
But he found the mark in the second half and finished with 220 yards passing on 
14 of 28 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Tay Galloway added 90 yards rushing for the Bulldogs, while Titan 
running back Reggie Yarbrough had 101 yards in 29 carries. 
</P>
<P>
However, Yarbrough's fumble on Fullerton's first possession ended a scoring 
threat. Schulte had teamed with Celestine on a 58-yard pass play to the 
Mississippi State 13, but Yarbrough lost control of a handoff and Albert 
Williams recovered for the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a matter of depth," Murphy said about the loss. "Reggie (Yarbrough) was 
tired, the offensive line was hurt and tired, and our defense was on the field 
too long in the first half. We turned the ball over, and critical penalties 
kept their drives alive. But we played hard." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Starting quarterback Paul Schulte's injury is not considered serious, and 
Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said Schulte would be back in the lineup for next 
week's game at Akron. The senior tried throwing on the sidelines in the third 
quarter but was unable to return. "I couldn't throw the ball much more than 10 
yards," Schulte said. "I couldn't put any zip on it. I couldn't play." . . . 
Fullerton receiver J.J. Celestine caught five passes for 121 yards, and Richard 
Harrison caught four passes for 87 yards. . . . More travel travails: 
Fullerton's return trip today was pushed up several hours, meaning the Titans 
had to leave their hotel at 3:15 a.m. (CDT) for a bus ride to the airport at 
Jackson, Miss.

Two halves of football. That's what it takes, and that's what Rancho Buena 
Vista got Saturday night. And that was bad news for Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
In a game matching the fourth-ranked team from Orange County against the No. 3 
team from San Diego, host RBV scored a 45-24 victory in front of 2,500 at Vista 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo held a 24-21 halftime lead on the strength of two touchdown 
passes by Tom Snowden, but that would be it for the Diablos' offense. Mission 
Viejo was stung by second-half turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns tied the score at 24-24 on a 25-yard field goal to open the third 
quarter. Mission Viejo was driving for its fourth touchdown when a fumble 
occurred between Snowden and center Brian Hodson. It was the first of four 
turnovers for the Diablos. 
</P>
<P>
RBV turned the miscue into a 31-24 lead after Edric Hall rushed for 68 yards 
and Tyrone Cormier scored from five yards out. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the fumbled exchange really took the wind out of our sails," 
Mission Viejo Coach Mike Rush said. "And our defense didn't keep them out of 
the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's next three drives ended in interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
After the first interception, Tyrone Cormier scored from 13 yards to make it 
38-24. 
</P>
<P>
Snowden, who completed 17 of 23 passes for 201 yards in the first half, 
finished 26 of 38 for 294. 
</P>
<P>
RBV gained 523 yards on the ground, victimizing the Diablos with big plays all 
night. The Longhorns had rushes of 67 and 40 yards in the first half and 32, 68 
and 53 yards in the second. MARTIN HENDERSON

Fullerton College showed off an impressive running game Saturday that rolled up 
395 yards as the Hornets defeated Cerritos, 21-13, at Fullerton District 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's running game was so dominant that the Hornets attempted only two 
passes -- both incomplete -- in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The surge was led by a quick offensive line and darting quarterback Eric 
Robinson. Robinson, who was a wide receiver at Fullerton last season, rushed 
for 146 yards in 24 carries. He completed four of 11 passes for 78 yards and 
one touchdown. Fullerton had 473 yards in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
"He a tremendous athlete," Fullerton Coach Hal Sherbeck said of Robinson. "We 
knew he could do some things, that's why we moved him." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's two freshman tailbacks also had strong performances. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Williams rushed for 118 yards in 14 carries and scored a touchdown. Coy 
Collins ran for 81 yards and a score in 17 carries. Sophomore fullback Don 
Norris added 32 yards in nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are better backs in this league, I don't want them," said Sherbeck, 
who is in his 30th season. "I'll take ours." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's defense also had a strong night, led by linebacker Ward Van Pelt 
and defensive back Matt Shackelford. Van Pelt recovered a fumble and nabbed an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
Shackelford had a pair of interceptions, each near the end of both halves. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton scored on a 14-yard run by Williams and on a 31-yard pass from 
Robinson to tight end Rob Coons in the second quarter and led, 14-10, at the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton took a 21-10 lead on a four-yard run by Collins in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos got a 37-yard field goal by J.D. Barker to cut the lead to 21-13 with 
12:53 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos (1-1) then got as close as the Fullerton 2 before the Hornet defense 
came up with an important play with about 7 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos quarterback Pete Montera completed a 10-yard pass from the 12 to 
Charles Hicks, but as Hicks turned to run for the goal line he was smashed by 
several Fullerton players and the ball popped out. It was caught in the air by 
Toby Howell. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton then used its ground game to run out most of the remaining time.Twice 
on third down, Robinson was able to convert by scrambling as the Hornets drove 
to the Cerritos 28 before turning over the ball on downs with 1:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
Montera, from Kennedy High School, completed two passes before he was 
intercepted by Shackelford with 18 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Montera was nine of 33 for 270 yards and one touchdown. He also threw three 
interceptions. The touchdown was a 75-yarder to Cliff Parks in the second 
quarter. Parks ran a simple post pattern, but the Fullerton secondary bought 
into a play fake by Montera, leaving Parks at least 20 yards in the clear for 
the easy score. Parks caught four passes for 172 yards. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica 33, Saddleback College 16 -- Jeff Barrett threw for a touchdown 
and ran for two others as Santa Monica (1-0) won at home. Chris Bisgaard scored 
on a five-yard run to pace Saddleback (0-1). 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago 32, San Diego Mesa 6 -- Estrus Crayton rushed for 93 yards on 
21 carries and caught three passes for 94 yards to lead the Dons (1-0) at San 
Diego Mesa. Crayton scored three touchdowns, two on passes from Richard Fanti 
and one on a one-yard run. Fanti completed 10 of 14 passes for 195 yards and 
two touchdowns. Reserve quarterback Steve Calhoun was five of eight for 57 
yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago amassed 449 yards in total offense and limited San Diego to 12 
yard rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West 35, Long Beach 14 -- Frank Vaccara rushed for 116 yards in 19 
carries, including a 72-yard touchdown run on the first carry of the second 
half, to lead Golden West (1-0) at Long Beach (0-2).

THE ART ON THE COVER: HOW IT ALL CAME TOGETHER

<TEXT>
<P>
David Hockney has been experimenting with his new Canon RC 470 still video 
camera for only a few weeks, and he's shooting whoever happens to drop by the 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
That's what I did the other day, just as the artist was looking for a fifth 
person to fill out a portrait he was working on. His studio assistant, Richard 
Schmidt, asked if I would participate. 
</P>
<P>
Agreeing, I join four other volunteers in front of the artist's huge, still 
unfinished painting of the Santa Monica Mountains. They are Schmidt, framer 
Michael Hogarth, hair stylist Phil Ackerman and Hockney pal John Fitzherbert. 
</P>
<P>
The artist lines all of us up in front of the canvas. We all stare straight 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Hockney picks up his new camera and starts shooting. Since the video camera 
images will appear on the video monitor in a specific order -- which Hockney 
has learned through experimentation -- the artist takes his photographs in that 
order. 
</P>
<P>
He crouches and moves from person to person taking pictures. The first picture 
is the first person's head. The second picture is the second person's head. 
Methodically, he moves from one person to the next, shooting everybody's head 
before he returns to the first person and starts shooting upper torsos. Lower 
torsos are next. Then legs. And finally feet. 
</P>
<P>
That done, Hockney pulls a small floppy disc out of the still video camera, 
pops it into the still video playback unit and everybody watches a composite 
photograph take shape on the video monitor. One by one, the photos appear on 
the screen exactly as shot -- heads, torsos, feet. 
</P>
<P>
The screen now is filled with our composite image. Looking at it, smiling, 
Hockney is clearly pleased. He moves a few feet to his color laser copier, 
where he pushes a button and makes copies of the screen for each of us. He 
stamps the 8 1/2-by-11-inch print twice, first with a stamp that reads "There 
is no such thing as an unlimited edition," then with a stamp that reads "hand 
stamped, David Hockney." 
</P>
<P>
Elapsed time from first photograph to first print: 8 minutes.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout his prolific, if somewhat erratic 40-year career in the jazz 
business, tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins has been regarded by fellow 
musicians, critics and fans alike as a mercurial improviser of unmatched 
invention. 
</P>
<P>
New Yorker magazine jazz critic Whitney Balliet has called him "possibly the 
most incisive and influential jazz instrumentalist since Charlie Parker." 
</P>
<P>
"He's the baddest . . . in the world!" exclaims trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, who 
played in Rollins' group in the late '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Rollins, who turned 60 last week has earned the accolades. He has recorded over 
50 LPs, many of which are back in print on compact disc, written classics like 
"Oleo," "St. Thomas" and "Airegin," and has worked, in person and in the 
recording studio, with the giants of jazz. Among his cohorts: drummers Max 
Roach, Philly Joe Jones, Elvin Jones and Tony Williams, trumpeters Miles Davis, 
Clifford Brown and Fats Navarro, pianists Bud Powell, Herbie Hancock and 
Thelonious Monk and fellow saxophonists John Coltrane, Coleman Hawkins and 
Branford Marsalis, who appears on his most recent release, "Falling in Love 
with Jazz" (Milestone). Rollins brings his band -- pianist Mark Soskin, drummer 
Al Foster, guitarist Jerome Harris, bassist Bob Cranshaw and trombonist Clifton 
Anderson -- to the Strand in Redondo Beach Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Rollins is relatively unmoved by the above circum vitae. "Have I had a 
wonderful career? Well, I hope so," he laughs quietly, sitting on a couch in 
his small downtown Manhattan studio apartment on the 39th floor of a highrise, 
with windows that look north toward midtown and the Empire State Building. 
</P>
<P>
"But I've been described as having the most up-and-down career of anyone in 
jazz," he says, referring to his two two-year sabbaticals from performances -- 
from 1959-61 and 1969-71 -- and his problems with drugs early in his life. "So 
I don't sit around and think I'm so great." 
</P>
<P>
Well, others do, and for good reason. Rollins' performances, delivered with a 
raucous yet human tone and an animated stage presence, are scintillating. He 
plays with passion, yet readily displays a refreshing sense of humor. He works 
with a rhythmic certainty of the best drummers, so that he always puts his 
phrases where, and when, he wants them. He's blessed with a warehouse of a 
memory that recalls the lines to hundreds of archaic pop tunes and can make 
those tunes' melodies fit right into a driving, probing improvisation. He 
possesses a quicksilver technique capable of playing lines that careen like a 
race car running the streets of Monte Carlo. And he can develop an almost 
gut-bucket bluesiness that permeates the heart of his solos, making them cook 
whether the tempo's a simmer or a rolling boil. 
</P>
<P>
Rollins has an original jazz voice, rooted in the bebop mode, but a voice that 
has evolved over time, incorporating other styles and other forms as they fit 
that voice. 
</P>
<P>
But praise isn't something Rollins is very comfortable with. "Don't compliment 
me too much, man," he told this reporter in an another interview. He's likely 
to take such approval, consider it for a moment, and then point out his 
shortcomings. It's a philosophy the Manhattan native who made his first 
recording date in 1949 has employed most of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always trying to get the best out of myself all the time," he says. 
"There's always a goal I'm trying to reach. It's not like I've learned and I 
can sit back and wait for inspiration. I have to be demanding because everybody 
-- myself, the musicians in my band, the audiences, they always want you to be 
tip-top." 
</P>
<P>
This self-imposed demand requires considerable effort. "It's hard, because I'm 
serious about what I'm doing -- keeping fresh, keeping my own thing, not doing 
what others are doing," he says with a stern gaze that's remarkably similar to 
pictures taken of him in the '50s. "I'm not complacent." 
</P>
<P>
Rollins doesn't look 60. His coffee-with-a dash-of-cream-colored complexion has 
the resilience and suppleness of a much younger man, his eyes blaze with life, 
and he's kept his figure toned and firm, the result of a life change he 
undertook in 1955. At that time, he kicked hard drugs -- "I finally got that 
monkey off my back," he says with a soft sigh -- and began a devotion to yoga, 
exercise and a health-conscious diet. 
</P>
<P>
Only tinges of white along the edges of his well-trimmed beard and his hairline 
indicate the passage of time. "Do I dye it?" he laughs, repeating a reporter's 
query. "Remember Ronald Reagan never answered that question," and he laughs 
again, not answering the question. 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, he sometimes feels the wear and tear of 40 years spent in the 
jazz business. 
</P>
<P>
"The aches and pains have increased as I get older, and I don't have as much 
breath as I used to," says Rollins. "That's a drag. I used to never have to 
think about breath. Now it's that and other things." 
</P>
<P>
Like regular trips to his dentist, which is the reason the saxophonist has 
remained in Manhattan for a few days after a weekend concert in Toledo, Ohio, 
instead of traveling with Lucille, his wife of 33 years, to their home in 
Germantown, N.Y., about 2 1/2 hours north of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Or maintaining his position as one of the leaders of the mainstream jazz realm, 
a vigil that keeps Rollins -- who these days incorporates an eclectic 
assortment of funk, soul and contemporary pop pieces into his usual repertoire 
of great pop standards, jazz classics and originals -- ever on the alert. 
</P>
<P>
"As I've gotten older, I'm trying to protect my image, what I have built up 
over the years so I'm trying to make everything -- in performance and on record 
-- come out perfect," he says, his face revealing an expression that's part 
melancholic, part contemplative. "I don't want my reputation to go down. I want 
to keep up a level which is better than what I've done, at least better." 
</P>
<P>
In his desire to stay fit for the battle, the saxophonist practices as much as 
six hours a day in his secluded, one-room studio that he has in Germantown, 
where the Rollinses live on 10 acres of wooded land. He works within an 
organized regimen. 
</P>
<P>
"I have my own book of things, sort of "Sonny's Rudiments," scales, fingering 
skills, all of these things that I have written out that I work on constantly," 
he says. "Like some fingerings that would be more difficult in one key than 
another. When I'm able to master those things, I'll feel more confident, be a 
little bit happier with myself. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I do some sight-reading. I'm working with a book of scales and patterns 
by (fellow saxophonist) Yusef Lateef that's excellent and I'm also playing 
excerpts from arias by Wagner. I do this to get into some other things that 
people are thinking about. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there's free blowing, because that's what I'm doing when I'm on the 
(band)stand." 
</P>
<P>
When in Manhattan, Rollins rarely leaves the apartment -- "It's really a place 
Lucille and I keep to go to and from the airport," he says -- to hear other 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"My mind is so full of my own music, it's difficult to listen to others," he 
notes. "It's really a time factor. I don't have time to get into what someone 
else is doing. Maybe part of it is like, 'Don't look back, something may be 
gaining on you,' that Satchel Paige saying. It's also a matter of cluttering up 
my mind, putting in new stuff, not that it's not already cluttered," he laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Rollins has a hunch that if he did get out more often, he'd benefit. "I'm a 
good audience, and when I go out and listen, I really enjoy the music, so it's 
probably something I'd get something out of for my own work," he says. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the saxophonist leaves his upstate home on an average of five days 
a month, working mostly concerts, with an occasional nightclub engagement 
tossed in. It's a schedule that suits him. "My life is pretty relaxing," he 
says, smiling. "As compared to someone who works very hard, like Dizzy 
Gillespie, who works a lot of small clubs, five-to-six nights a week," he says. 
"He thrives on that, but I can't handle that anymore. It's really too much. I 
put too much energy into what I'm playing. Still, I do tours, like in Japan, 
where I'll play, say, 14 concerts in three weeks. That's hard." 
</P>
<P>
In his first years in the jazz business, Rollins would play two-to-four week 
engagements in nightclubs, both as a leader and as a sideman. He says the best 
thing about such situations was the closeness the musicians would achieve. 
"Clubs were great musically," he says. "The band would get so tight. It's 
difficult to get that old closeness when you play concerts and one-nighters." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Theodore Rollins (the name has been reversed in record books because 
Rollins himself changed it on several documents) grew up in Harlem, the second 
son, in addition to a daughter, of Walter William and Valborg Rollins, from St. 
Croix and St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born on 137th Street, lived on 135th, 136th, then moved uptown Edgecombe 
Avenue and 153rd on Sugar Hill, where the well-to-do blacks like Duke Ellington 
lived," he says. His father was a Chief Petty Officer in the Navy -- "It was 
the highest grade a black could hold in the Navy at the time," he says -- and 
usually away at sea. 
</P>
<P>
After piano studies at 11, Rollins played alto saxophone, then switched to 
tenor in high school. Early listening experiences at an uncle's house marked 
the youngster with a lifelong interest in jazz and blues. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to stay with my uncle, Reuben Victoria, in the daytime, and he was 
going with a woman named Lizzie, who was into music," he recalls. "She was 
really something and had all these old blues records by Lonnie Johnson, Arthur 
Cruddup -- Big Boy Cruddup, that was my man -- Big Joe Williams, real old time 
blues." Rollins soon fell under the influence of saxophonists Coleman Hawkins, 
Ben Webster, Don Byas and Charlie Parker; later, he would often play with 
Hawkins, Parker and Webster, and recorded with the former two. 
</P>
<P>
The fast lane was Rollins' lane from the dawn of his professional life. At 17, 
he was leading a band composed of such future jazz stars as pianist Kenny Drew, 
altoist Jackie McLean and drummer Art Taylor opposite Thelonious Monk at the 
Club Baron, at 133rd St. and Lenox in Harlem. In January, 1949, at 18, he made 
his recording debut with singer Babs Gonzales, and later that year, recorded 
with both Monk and Bud Powell. That same year, he began an association with 
trumpeter Miles Davis that lasted on and off through the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Remembering his work with Davis led to some free associating. "I worked with 
Miles all over the East Coast, and on some gigs, (John Coltrane) and I were in 
the band," he says. "It wasn't a regular band, but we did do some gigs. Kenny 
Clarke and Doc West might have been the drummers. Doc was on the "Cool Blues" 
and "This is Always" sessions with Bird (Charlie Parker, recording on Dial 
records). That great one with (singer) Earl Coleman. In fact, I just started 
playing that song, "This is Always." It came to my mind in this funky club I 
was playing in in Houston a couple of months ago. It came to me all of a 
sudden, and now I've worked it into my repertoire. In fact, I played it last 
night in Toledo." To finish his recollection, he sings the melody to "Cool 
Blues," a classic from the pen of Parker. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-to-late '50s, Rollins and Coltrane were the preeminent saxophonists 
of jazz. But in 1959, Rollins felt he needed time out of the public eye to 
study, practice and compose, and for two years he remained in seclusion and did 
not perform. However, his practice sessions on the Williamsburg bridge, which 
connects Manhattan and Brooklyn, became the stuff of legend. Later, in 1968, he 
spent five months in an ashram near Bombay, meditating and getting his life in 
order. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came back to New York, I was really together, in a nice frame of mind, 
but that didn't last too long," he says. "So I left music again, until 1971." 
</P>
<P>
Of the numerous albums Rollins has made as a leader, there are, not 
surprisingly, few that please his ear. "I like some of the tracks on some 
records," he says, "but not whole records. I always feel something could have 
been done better." 
</P>
<P>
Self-critic or no, Rollins acknowledges he has a "lot of music yet to play," 
and says he hopes people will take his oeuvre into account when they come to 
hear him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like people to remember that I'm a guy who's played with Lester Young, Ben 
Webster, Coleman Hawkins and John Coltrane, actually played with them, not just 
for two minutes, but a lot of times," he says. "That means something. It means 
a lot to me. Ten to 15 years ago, people might have seen me and said, "Oh, 
who's that guy?" and split. Now, maybe they'll stay because they know my 
history."

POP FACES: BACK TO HER ROYAL ROOTS; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER YEARS OF STRAYING, CARLENE CARTER FINDS THE MUSIC SHE WAS BORN TO SUITS 
HER BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All through her life, Carlene Carter's been told she really should be a country 
singer -- it's in her blood. 
</P>
<P>
Carter is a member of country music's royal family. Maybelle Carter, one of the 
progenitors of modern country, was her grandmother. Carl Smith, a singer with 
almost 30 Top 10 country hits in the 1950s, is her father. June Carter Cash is 
her mother. Johnny Cash is her stepfather. Rosanne Cash is her stepsister. 
</P>
<P>
But, in her youth, Carlene Carter rebelled. 
</P>
<P>
"Musically, I always wanted to experiment," the energetic Nashville native said 
recently, sitting in an office at Warner Bros. Records' Burbank headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
On five albums recorded between 1977 and 1983 she did just that, playing around 
with various new wave, pop and rock styles while working with mostly English 
rockers like Nick Lowe (her then-husband) and Graham Parker's band, the Rumour. 
She didn't ignore her roots -- the best of those albums, the 1980 Lowe-produced 
"Musical Shapes," featured Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire" and the Carter Family's 
"Foggy Mountain Top," but in a rock context. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 34, Carter wonders if those who told her to sing country were right. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah," she said. "I wish I'd listened to them. I might have cut the chase 
more." 
</P>
<P>
The chase has been cut now, and Carter has reclaimed her heritage. Her new 
single and album, both titled "I Fell in Love," are two of the hottest things 
in country music. Produced by Howie Epstein (bass player for Tom Petty &amp; 
the Heartbreakers), the album is a crisp and vibrant collection of 
country-oriented songs that refer directly to Carter's roots without holding 
back her spunky playfulness. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point came four years ago, when Carter signed on with her mother 
and aunts in the Carter Family for two years of touring and came to realize 
that her experiments could fit with her background just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I took all these things and combined them with this person inside my skin that 
just has to yodel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Carter also credits longtime friend Epstein with helping her get in touch with 
her roots. That's most obvious on the tender "Me and the Wildwood Rose." 
</P>
<P>
"I did that as a suggestion from Howie that I should write about being a kid," 
she said. "I let the music come out like a Carter Family song. That came from 
deep inside, but it was like it came from somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
And now that she's getting a second chance at a recording career, Carter has 
found that the lessons learned from her family are not just musical. 
</P>
<P>
"One good thing is I was instilled with really good values," she said. "My mom 
treats everyone the same. You could be the President or a waitress at a truck 
stop. . . . My mom always said, 'You work as hard as you can and don't get 
caught up in the stardom thing. Don't get that big head, 'cause God'll split 
your pants on stage.' "

THE SEASON'S NEW ROCK 'N' ROLL HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gil Grant jokes that it felt like he'd been grazed by a Mike Tyson uppercut 
when NBC executives told him they wanted to produce his mischievous script 
about life between classes at a contemporary high school, but only if he could 
figure out a way to transform it into a musical. He wasn't knocked out, but it 
took him a couple days to shake out the cobwebs and climb up off the mat. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought, 'Oh great. I'm the guy who in the '60s, while everyone 
else was going to The Doors concert, was home watching Dean Martin on 
television every Thursday night,' " said Grant, a 40-year-old, bearded man with 
an earring, who created "The Oldest Rookie" and wrote for years for "Eight Is 
Enough." "I told them, 'Sure, if you want a hip high school show, you've really 
come to the right person.' " 
</P>
<P>
While Steven Bochco has sniped that "Hull High," which at one time was called 
"Hull Street High," only became a musical because ABC already had bought his 
musical, "Cop Rock," executives at NBC and Disney, which is producing the show, 
said that they collectively decided that just doing a comedy about high school 
wasn't enough "to hook the audience." 
</P>
<P>
"The script was terrific. It was very funny," said Garth Ancier, president of 
network television production at Disney. "But we thought it needed one extra 
piece to really make it special. There were a number of ideas bandied about. 
NBC had aired a musical a few years back called 'Rags to Riches' that had a 
real vitality to it. And Disney has the tradition of being in the musical form, 
and so we all wanted to try it. There was a great belief that a musical could 
succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Even when musicals, especially "Rags to Riches," have bombed as series? 
</P>
<P>
"I think television has under-realized the potential of music in series 
programs," said Perry Simon, NBC's executive vice president of prime-time 
programs. "If you have the creative forces to make it work, music gives you a 
tremendous upside with the audience. But the show has to succeed on its own 
dramatic merits, with strong characters, stories and relationships. Music 
cannot make a difference if it's being used as a crutch." 
</P>
<P>
Grant, the show's executive producer, hired Kenny Ortega, the choreographer 
from the film "Dirty Dancing," as co-executive producer and primary director of 
the show. Then he retooled the script, looking for ways to inject music. The 
first thing he hit on was a rapping Greek chorus of four teen-agers, who serve 
as the conscience of the school and thread the story lines together with an 
ongoing commentary in rap. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we had to figure out how to do the bigger musical numbers," Grant said. 
"And we decided to come at it either out of fantasy or something we call 
heightened reality. Like the opening number in the pilot, it's just the high 
school band and drill team practicing out in front of the school, but it's the 
greatest band and drill team in the country." 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, which has already aired twice on NBC, also featured an adolescent 
boy's fantasy that shows the sexiest, youngest teacher in America, decked out 
in a tight leather outfit, singing and dancing about similes and metaphors and 
writhing provocatively on a huge volume of "Longfellow's Collected Works." A 
future episode will showcase a young female libertine trying to infiltrate the 
all-boys wrestling team in a smoky dance that is half wrestling, half ballet. 
Another episode has a rap version of "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" that 
denounces drinking on a school field trip. 
</P>
<P>
But, mostly, the show reminisces with great energy and some innocent 
raunchiness about Grant's own high school experience in Arizona. "I didn't want 
it to be 'TV 101' or 'The Bronx Zoo' because my experience of high school 
wasn't some preachy and sanctimonious issue of the week. It was a series of 
fragments and stories and problems that happened between Period 1 and at your 
locker going to Period 2." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the scripts are written first, with an eye toward ironing out the 
story lines and plot twists, and then Grant and his music people go back 
through them to see where a music or dance sequence might enhance the action. 
Often, during the actual production, Grant said that Ortega will choreograph a 
whimsical dance bit at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike "Cop Rock," all of the music is prerecorded. And while the primary 
actors do their own dancing, most of them lip-sync the songs to the voices of 
professional singers. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the prerecordings, to meet budget and time constraints, subsequent 
episodes of the show will contain far less elaborate production numbers than 
the pilot. Grant said that regular episodes will at most feature one full-scale 
number and several other smaller musical bits. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Grant says that the show costs 30% more than the average drama. Disney's 
Ancier would only say that his company will spend more on this series than any 
other hourlong show it currently has in the works. Disney is willing to suffer 
a rather large financial hit initially, Ancier said, because it believes the 
show's music and its hip MTV attitude will make it a viable and lucrative 
product in the syndication market several years down the road. 
</P>
<P>
NBC has deliberately programmed "Hull High" in a time period (Sundays at 7 
p.m.) that has been devoid of programs for teen-agers since Fox moved "21 Jump 
Street" to a different night a year ago. It is doubtful that "Hull High's" 
ratings will ever surpass "60 Minutes," but it does provide an alternative to 
the news magazine and to ABC's more serious-minded drama, "Life Goes On." Fox 
will compete this season with two new sitcoms, including "Parker Lewis Can't 
Lose," another rambunctious series set in a modern day high school. 
</P>
<P>
"We might get lucky," Grant said. "Just because of the sheer amount of music 
out there today. It's such a huge portion of kids' lives. It infiltrates 
everything. We really do give those kids something to watch at that hour and I 
think something for adults to watch with their kids."

LAST-DITCH LOSSES GET TO BE HABIT; 
</P>
<P>
STANFORD: AFTER LOSING TO COLORADO WITH 12 SECONDS TO PLAY, THE CARDINAL ENDS 
UP ON SHORT END WITH ONE SECOND REMAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If not for games a total of 13 seconds too long, Stanford's football team would 
be 2-0 today. 
</P>
<P>
Against Colorado 10 days ago, the Cardinal held a 17-14 lead, but the Buffaloes 
scored a touchdown with 12 seconds remaining to win. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's 32-31 loss to UCLA was even harder to take. The Cardinal led, 31-29, 
until Brad Daluiso's 21-yard field goal with one second remaining. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult for the Cardinal players to accept their plight. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford held its own against sixth-ranked Colorado in amassing more than 300 
total yards. The Cardinal led at halftime, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
Against UCLA, it was more of the same. Stanford gained 386 yards and led early 
in the third quarter, 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
"It's draining to lose two weeks in a row like this," said Stanford wide 
receiver Ed McCaffrey, who caught nine passes for 123 yards and two touchdowns. 
"It seems unfair, but there usually is a winner and loser in football, and the 
last two weeks, we've been losers. Losses like this stay with you for the rest 
of your life." 
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey, who missed the Colorado game because of back spasms, was 
disappointed that Stanford did not have an opportunity to get the ball back 
after Daluiso's field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"(Quarterback Jason Palumbis) was doing a great job all game reading their 
defense," McCaffrey said. "I was just hoping that our offense would get back on 
the field one more time." 
</P>
<P>
Palumbis, who completed 21 of 32 passes for 231 yards and two touchdowns, felt 
his fourth-quarter pass that was intercepted by Roman Phifer inside Stanford's 
20-yard line was the crucial blow. 
</P>
<P>
"We owned the clock, and we were able to run and pass on them all day," 
Palumbis said. "But we made a few bad plays there in the second half, and my 
interception cost us." 
</P>
<P>
Palumbis said that the Bruins confused him on the interception. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that they would drop back into a zone and that I'd have the middle 
open," he said. "But they dropped inside, and I made the mistake of throwing it 
in there." 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Glyn Milburn, who gained 166 yards in total offense, said it is 
important for Stanford to keep its morale up after these early season losses. 
</P>
<P>
"We did want to make a good showing today, but things did not go our way," said 
Milburn, who was a standout at Santa Monica High School. "It is disappointing 
to lose like this." 
</P>
<P>
The defense also felt frustration. The Cardinal's secondary allowed Bruin 
quarterback Tommy Maddox to pass for 244 yards and two touchdowns in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"They had us all spread out on defense," said Stanford defensive coordinator 
Willie Shaw. "In the second half when they brought Maddox in, they went to a 
shotgun flood formation. With his mobility and the fact that he was setting 
back a lot deeper, we had problems getting pressure in on him. Our young 
defensive line didn't make the adjustment to rush further upfield." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's secondary proved vulnerable to Maddox's hot passing despite often 
having six defensive backs in coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good defense, but they just made the right calls at the right time," 
said Stanford defensive back Tuan Van Le. "We did not know what Maddox was 
going to do once they got inside the 50. We knew we had to go out there and 
stop him at the end, but he made the plays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough because we kicked their butts all over the field, moving the ball 
whenever we wanted to. But, it comes down to the scoreboard. . . . So give UCLA 
credit." 
</P>
<P>
With its first home game of the season next week against Oregon State, Stanford 
is not giving up on its season yet. 
</P>
<P>
"A loss is a loss and losing a Pac-10 game hurts a little more," McCaffrey 
said. "But, we have a lot of character, and I'm sure we'll gain from this." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shaw: "We played our hearts out. You could see it in their eyes there at 
the end that they wanted to win."

NEWSWIRE: SPRINTER IS STRIDING TOWARD FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an event that produces superstars, sprinter Mark Witherspoon sees himself as 
an unknown quantity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the Unknown Sprinter," Witherspoon said Saturday after beating Leroy 
Burrell in the 100-meter dash in an international track and field meet at 
Shizuoka, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like being unknown, but I have no say in the matter," Witherspoon 
said. "I guess I just have to run faster more often." 
</P>
<P>
A one week ago, Witherspoon beat Burrell and Carl Lewis at Rieti, Italy. His 
best time this year of 10.05 seconds is one of the top five for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's 100 was split into heats, with Burrell and Witherspoon starting 
first on the rain-soaked track. Witherspoon (10.21) beat Burrell (10.23) by 
about one meter. Lewis (10.23) had to rally in the final 20 meters to beat 
Dennis Mitchell (10.25) in the second heat. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the best athletes in the world competed, times were hampered 
by the wet track. 
</P>
<P>
"The track was really soaked and hard to run on," said Butch Reynolds, 
400-meter world record-holder. "And the humidity was also a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds rallied in the final meters to edge Danny Everett and Cuba's Roberto 
Hernandez. Reynolds' time was 44.77. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Kingdom, the world record-holder and two-time Olympic gold medalist, led 
an American sweep in the 110-meter high hurdles, winning in 13.28. Courtney 
Hawkins was second in 13.38 and Tonie Campbell third in 13.59.

Barbarika took the lead coming out of the gate and held off a challenge from 
Colonial Waters to win the third running of the $183,100 Grade III Budweiser 
Breeders' Cup by a neck Saturday at Turfway Park.

<P>
The 5-year-old mare, with Aaron Gryder aboard, held a small advantage over a

</P>
<P>
Colonial Waters, ridden by Jim Bruin, advanced on the outside on the run down

REDSKINS WILL BE REAL TEST FOR 49ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM JENKINS, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Did the New Orleans Saints expose some genuine San Francisco 49ers weaknesses 
in Monday night's season opener? 
</P>
<P>
After two Super Bowl championships in a row, has complacency finally set in 
with this group? 
</P>
<P>
Did 49ers owner Ed DeBartolo Jr. really mean it when he told an interviewer the 
other day that the goal of winning three straight titles might be a trifle 
unrealistic for a team he regards as being "in transition." 
</P>
<P>
And if none of this is true, then why did a panel of pro football experts lean 
heavily to Washington as the probable winner of today's 1 p.m. home opener for 
the 49ers at Candlestick Park? 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of it all, we DID win the game in New Orleans, even it was close 
(13-12)," 49ers offensive coordinator Mike Holmgren said, admonishing the 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
Although you won't get Holmgren or head coach George Seifert to say it 
publicly, the Phoenix Cardinals, beaten 31-0 by the Redskins last week, will 
never be confused with the Saints. Indeed, the Cardinals may very well be the 
weakest team in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to make excuses, because Holmgren, in a discourse of the 49ers' ups 
and downs in New Orleans games, wasn't offering any. 
</P>
<P>
He was quite impressed, in fact, with the Saints' preparation for the defending 
champs. He also was quick to add that there will be no drop-off this afternoon 
when the 49ers face what may be an even stronger defense posed by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't surprised by what the Saints did," Holmgren said. "When we were in 
New Orleans practicing for the Super Bowl, I went to say hello to the Saints' 
defensive coordinator, and they were in watching films of us. (Saints coach) 
Jim Mora even wanted to watch one of our practices. George (Seifert) said no, 
but, hey, he had to ask. We would have done the same thing in their situation." 
</P>
<P>
Preparation aside, in Holmgren's view, the 49ers were denied a key weapon in 
Monday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
The deafening noise of the Superdome not only led to five offensive-line 
penalties and no doubt contributed to six sacks, it prevented San Francisco 
from calling audibles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of our strengths," Holmgren said, nodding toward quarterback Joe 
Montana, who uncharacteristically threw some all-or-nothing passes downfield in 
the closing minutes. "I wasn't pleased with our execution, but the Superdome 
can be a difficult place to play when the crowd is against you. You couldn't 
hear. Yet that's only one small part of it. My disappointment is in the things 
that we could control. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, we knew they were going to bump Jerry Rice (and double-cover 
him). We had some motion plays to work against that, but, at the same time, we 
have to learn to do some of those things better." 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of that was Roger Craig's gaining only 23 yards on 12 carries and Rice 
catching just two passes for 26 yards. Holmgren conceded that not enough use 
was made of two other wideouts, John Taylor and Mike Sherrard. 
</P>
<P>
Rice was held to the second-lowest totals since his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to design something to get me open," Rice said, aware that in 
today's game he will face a Washington secondary that intercepted four passes 
against Phoenix. Each of the interceptions led to a touchdown, three of them 
coming on the passing of Mark Rypien. 
</P>
<P>
Washington coach Joe Gibbs doubts that the 49ers will be that sloppy this 
weekl. 
</P>
<P>
"(Montana) is very precise, very elusive and very smart, and their receivers 
are talented," Gibbs said. "You just try to keep down the big plays. You can't 
get upset if they get one on you because they get them on everybody. We'll just 
try and mix and match (the defensive coverages) and hope we make the right 
calls."

ALICE KAHN: NEW MACHO BICKERS TOWARD DESTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Look out, old macho's back. Any assumption that the sun was about to set on the 
masculine empire has been refuted by a new wave of misogyny in song, in crime, 
in war and even in marriage. This is Nuevo Macho -- unrepentant, 
guilt-trip-proof. 
</P>
<P>
Credit Saddam Hussein for the most recent surge. By embodying those traits men 
value -- firmness, toughness, confidence -- he is bringing on a reactive desire 
in Westerners to show they are as tough as he is. When Margaret Thatcher called 
Hussein "cruel and brutal," the Iraqis shot back by calling her an "old hag." 
</P>
<P>
And while the Iraqi News Agency stopped short of using the b-word to describe 
Thatcher, they did refer to her "canine, harsh voice." 
</P>
<P>
Tell me that some of our Western knights in shining Italian suits did not 
snicker over this? I giggled myself. 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if Hussein is appealing to something deeply buried. For the past 
year, so many hit songs have used the b-word to refer to women that some rap 
music seems to be veering toward rape music. Some of the lyrics of 2 Live Crew 
use the b-word as if there were two sexes -- men and b's. And their right to 
use that word is vigorously defended by tough women lawyers from the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
Crimes against women, from the most violent to the most bizarre, have been on 
the rise. We all watched in befuddlement as a man shot homemade darts into the 
behinds of women in New York this past year. The newspapers dubbed him Dart Man 
as if he were some kind of comic book hero. 
</P>
<P>
But I don't think the full effect of Nuevo Macho hit me until our old friend 
Jimmy came to town. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I used to hang around with Jimmy and his wife, Barbara, 20 years 
ago, when educated men were starting to cook and clean and act as if women were 
as important as they are. Jimmy was always outdoing himself, showing that he 
was the most progressive guy around. You'd walk into his house and find him in 
an apron saying, "Come see the chocolate souffle I made for Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
This time, Jimmy was in town by himself for a job interview. Nothing brings out 
the inner beast like facing your exact value to the world. So I attributed some 
of what he said to that painful experience -- that and the six-pack he put away 
at our house that night. 
</P>
<P>
"Are a lot of your friends divorced?" he asked. "Everyone we know got 
divorced." 
</P>
<P>
Now, I wasn't sure if he wanted an answer to his question, but the fact is that 
most of our friends had stayed married. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember Steve and Vicki, who went to Canada in the '60s?" I offered. "They 
got divorced." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a plague," he said. "It's the AIDS of marriage. So, do you two fight a 
lot?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"She does," said my husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard an NPR report on bickering," Jimmy reported. "They said that all 
couples bicker. They had some therapists on there talking about how bickering 
is necessary to a marriage." 
</P>
<P>
I wondered if they offered Fair Bickering Workshops. "So, what are you and 
Barbara bickering about?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The same old things," he said, and then, " . . . sometimes I just want to slit 
her throat and tie her to the railroad tracks." 
</P>
<P>
Well, old Jimmy always had a flair for hyperbole, but this seemed like a new 
level. Not exactly bickering words. Then Jimmy turned to my husband and asked, 
"How about you? Do you ever want to slit Alice's throat?" 
</P>
<P>
My husband has a way of dealing with these situations. He just sits there and 
doesn't say a word. 
</P>
<P>
But I was squirming. I mean, what is the polite thing to do in such situations? 
I was torn between wanting to be nice to a friend and wanting to scream. Miss 
Manners, help me out here! 
</P>
<P>
So I said what I thought was a compromise. "Well, I think he wants to slit my 
throat but not tie me to the railroad tracks." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this was the height of Nuevo Macho. There I was -- ready to slit my 
own throat -- just to be one of the boys.

AT HOME: FOR MANY, LIVING ON THE HILL IS TOPS; 
</P>
<P>
ADAMS HILL: ONCE PART OF A RANCHO, THE AREA STRADDLES THE LOS ANGELES AND 
GLENDALE BOUNDARY. IT NOW ATTRACTS RESIDENTS 'WHO NEED A HOME THAT'S NOT OUT OF 
REACH.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adams Hill, on the border of Los Angeles and southeast Glendale, is a sunny, 
breezy, jaunty place, bedecked with flowers and burbling with bird song. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn LaMadeleine Carrillo of Coldwell Banker, listing the area's main 
attractions, says: "It's so close to L.A. Also, a lot, a lot of the homes there 
have views. And you can find three-bedrooms in that area for 250 ($250,000)." 
</P>
<P>
How close is it? Well, most Angelenos have seen Adams Hill, even if they don't 
know what they're looking at: A cross marks the spot. 
</P>
<P>
It gleams white from the museum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, which occupies 
the southwest part of the hill, and is plainly visible for miles in either 
direction from the Golden State and Glendale freeways. Adams Hill nestles 
between those two freeways, just north of where they intersect. 
</P>
<P>
Nestle, that favorite verb of the real estate industry truly applies here. 
Small houses nestle on small lots that nestle on winding roads, some of which 
-- belying the quaint and rustic feel of the area -- bear the names of vast and 
sophisticated Eastern campuses: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Wellesley, Cornell, 
Oberlin, Dartmouth. 
</P>
<P>
John Wilson, an associate at Dorn-Platz &amp; Co. realtors, says that in 
addition to a lot of old-timers "who love the place," the hill represents "an 
intermediate step upward," ideal for "people who are moving to the area who 
need a home that isn't out of reach." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson grew up in the area but sensibly refrained from living on Adams Hill -- 
his brand of deadpan drollery might charm the birds from the trees. After he 
retired from the Bell System, he says, "I cut the same bush every day at the 
house and followed my wife around like a puppy dog" until he started his career 
in real estate at the age of 59. 
</P>
<P>
The houses on Adams Hill, he says, "generally are 40 to 50 years old, family 
homes, well-maintained," that go "for somewhere between $120 and $150 a square 
foot." 
</P>
<P>
Besides its preponderance of old-time Anglos, the hill shows "quite a cross 
section of ethnic groups," Wilson says. And residents agree, mentioning Asians, 
Latinos and the fastest-growing segment, Middle-Easterners: Armenians, 
Iranians, Syrians and Lebanese. 
</P>
<P>
One glance at Adams Square, at the corner of Adams Street and Chevy Chase 
Drive, tells the story. Next to the rosy-beige Adams Square Pharmacy with its 
modest Art Deco tower, is the Super Mercado, and across the street is an 
Armenian grocery, the Zeitoon. 
</P>
<P>
The pharmacy's owner, Gil Franklin -- who's on a first-name basis with most of 
his customers -- says the building, which once contained a ballroom upstairs, 
has housed a store of some kind for 75 years. Nearby, at the intersection of 
Adams and Palmer streets, the first Baskin-Robbins ice cream store opened in 
1948. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Lawn is the largest landholder on Adams Hill ("They're very quiet 
neighbors," cracks Harnsberger Real Estate agent Cheryl Johnson), and those 
spacious acres probably represent the major draw for winged nesters. 
</P>
<P>
Some human ones are put off by the proximity to the cemetery. Bob Taylor, an 
associate at Harnsberger, says "about 40% would like to purchase because of 
Forest Lawn; maybe 60% wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Among the unspooked category were architect Georgie Kajer, who bought her house 
eight years ago for $85,000, and Bruce Cranston, 34, a Walt Disney Co. creative 
executive who moved there at the end of May, paying "close to the high 200s," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody considers Forest Lawn a plus, to look up there and see open 
space," says Kajer, a past president of the Adams Hill Homeowners Assn. "We get 
raccoons, opossums, skunks, all kind of little critters from across there." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining his move from Pasadena, Cranston says, "First of all, I have friends 
up here, . . . industry associates. And it's a hill, a well-kept hill." 
</P>
<P>
He revels in his view of south Glendale, and his easy commute. He considers the 
price he paid "very reasonable" in light of comparable houses in other areas, 
he says. "And there's always a breeze. It's cool at night." 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible to talk to anyone on the hill, old or new residents, without 
hearing mention of "afternoon sea breezes." It was a prime selling point of 
1920s developers. 
</P>
<P>
Until then the hill, roughly bounded by Palmer and Glendale avenues, Verdugo 
Road and the Forest Lawn boundary, had been almost bare. It was part of 36,000 
acres that Jose Maria Verdugo received from the governor of California in 1784. 
</P>
<P>
At his death in 1828, Verdugo left his Rancho San Rafael to his son, Julio, and 
daughter, Catalina. Don Julio, who was bequeathed the portion that included 
what is now Glendale, lived on Adams Hill from 1860 until his death in 1876. 
After that, as the rancho was broken into smaller parcels, W.C.R. Richardson 
owned much of the hill, which at the time bore the name of the Santa Eulalia 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, Glendale stopped at Colorado Boulevard. The 
settlement south of there was named Tropico by Southern Pacific when it built a 
railroad depot. Forest Lawn arrived in 1906. Tropico acceded to becoming part 
of Glendale in 1918, and a few years later, developers hopped onto the inviting 
hill in force. 
</P>
<P>
What is remarkable about their ads is how well they capture its flavor today. 
</P>
<P>
A 1923 newspaper promotion, thinly disguised as a news story, points out that 
the area's being "only about 20 minutes by automobile from Fifth and Spring 
streets .

COVER STORY: FORGET CAGNEY -- HERE'S ROSIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sharon Gless suffered from burnout after six years on the acclaimed CBS series 
"Cagney &amp; Lacey." Despite winning two Emmys as tough New York cop Chris 
Cagney, the actress vowed she would never do a series again. 
</P>
<P>
"I just retreated for about two years," she explained in her distinctively 
husky tones. "It sounds corny, but I just got in touch with me again. I got my 
personal life together. I have no regrets. I am very happy. I have never been 
as happy as I am today." 
</P>
<P>
And she's happily back on the airwaves in CBS' new series, "The Trials of Rosie 
O'Neill," premiering Monday at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
But during her self-imposed hiatus, Gless also had trials of her own. Earlier 
this year, Joni Leigh Penn, a 30-year-old woman who said she was in love with 
Gless, broke into her Studio City home armed with a rifle and barricaded 
herself. In July, Penn pleaded no contest to burglary charges and was sentenced 
to six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she is a very rare case," said Gless, who no longer lives in the 
Studio City home. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my fans are very loyal. We were very blessed that our fans on 'Cagney 
&amp; Lacey' are highly educated people. My audience is primarily women, but I 
get letters from young women and men. (Producer Barney Rosenzweig) says the men 
who like me aren't the type that write and say, 'I kiss my pillow at night.' 
They aren't the type who write fan letters." 
</P>
<P>
The Penn experience hasn't really changed her lifestyle. "I have extra security 
in my house," Gless said. "I have had experts come and fix my house so it 
cannot be broken into. But I walk around like anybody else. I have a very 
private life. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't go to a lot of parties -- partially because I am not invited to many," 
she added with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Gless got the itch to return to series TV late last year. She had plenty of 
offers -- all three networks wanted her to do a sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to do a sitcom," she said. "I prefer to do humor in a dramatic 
format. It seems easier for me to produce something humorous out of a dramatic 
situation. I like the hour format." 
</P>
<P>
"Rosie O'Neill" casts Gless as a divorced 43-year-old Beverly Hills lawyer who 
becomes a public defender. She has a new look as O'Neill -- a short, 
sophisticated hairstyle and an upscale wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
The series reunites Gless with Rosenzweig, who produced "Cagney &amp; Lacey," 
and it has the same time slot as "Cagney." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenzweig said he was reluctant to do another series when Gless approached 
him. "It's a painful process and a hard job," he said. "It's also a wonderful 
job. Eventually I began to think on the positive side." 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion Barney is the finest producer for women in the dramatic format," 
Gless said. "He's proven it, so I wanted to sign on with him again." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Rosenzweig and Gless had a production deal with ABC. The network, 
though, wasn't interested in another lawyer show. 
</P>
<P>
"ABC's position was that, 'We have enough lawyer shows,' " Rosenzweig said. 
"Ultimately, we compromised with a social worker. We even did a script on it." 
</P>
<P>
But the premise was not suited to Gless and Rosenzweig. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you there is no humor in social work," said Gless. "We went and 
researched it, and it was just too sad. I got in the car and just started 
crying after what I saw. It's grim." 
</P>
<P>
Too grim, at least, to make a TV series. After their deal with ABC ended, 
Rosenzweig had breakfast with CBS president Jeff Sagansky. Forty-five minutes 
later and without a script, Sagansky gave Rosenzweig the green light to do 
"Rosie." "It was very gratifying for me and Sharon to be trusted that way," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Sagansky told Rosenzweig to be ready for the fall, "Rosie O'Neill" 
didn't make the fall schedule. Rosenzweig said Sagansky didn't want the fall 
schedule to have two new series without pilots (the other is the Burt Reynolds 
comedy "Evening Shade"). "He had nothing to show the affiliates," said Gless. 
</P>
<P>
But when Connie Chung decided in July to take a pregnant pause in her career to 
concentrate on having a baby, the Monday evening time slot opened. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been doing some heavy praying," Gless said. "Barney sent her (Chung) 
balloons and wished her a happy mother's day." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a miracle," said Rosenzweig. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenzweig and Gless promise that just as with "Cagney &amp; Lacey," their new 
series will not shy away from controversial topics. "With Barney at the helm, 
he gets to make his political statements and I get to act," Gless said with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
On the premiere, Rosie defends a young woman accused of murdering her baby. 
"She's underage and tried to get an abortion in her state and her parents 
wouldn't sign the agreement," Gless said. "She came out here to get an abortion 
and was too far gone. She has the baby and believes the child is still-born, 
wraps it in a sweater and then buries it." 
</P>
<P>
Gless admitted some of her friends thought she was crazy to return to the grind 
of an hour series. "People said to me that you have no life when you do an hour 
show," said Gless. "Well, (the show) becomes my life. It's what I know how to 
do. When I'm working, I'm working. When I play, I play. I don't know how to 
split my focus."

DEMOCRATS TOLD TO WORK HARD BUT EXPECT LITTLE IN NOVEMBER VOTE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of the beleaguered Orange County Democratic Party encouraged their 
rank-and-file members Saturday to work as hard as they can for the November 
campaign, raise a lot of money and hope to win one state Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
That, and helping boost gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein's chances, is 
the sobering reality for the financially strapped Democrats in California's 
strongest Republican county, party chairman Michael Balmages told a three-day 
convention intended to rally the party faithful for the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 13 (state and federal) legislative seats up for election in Orange 
County," he said. "This time, we have a very modest goal -- we want to win one 
of those seats. I think one seat out of 13 is our fair share." 
</P>
<P>
Local Democratic power has sunk so low that Richard J. O'Neill, a former state 
and county Democratic chairman who spoke at a morning kickoff session, said the 
1990 effort should be considered a success if Feinstein loses Orange County by 
less than a 2-to-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Democratic candidates running in November were upset by the bleak 
assessment of their chances. Most signed a resolution to be considered by 
convention delegates today that declares: "Right now, this negative and 
self-defeating attitude has come to an end." 
</P>
<P>
"There is this butterfly within the cocoon of the Democratic Party," said Fred 
Smoller, a college instructor running against Assemblyman John R. Lewis 
(R-Orange). "You've got a feisty and hard-working group of people who are 
running, and a sort of defeatist group on top." 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Colon Becktell, challenging state Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim), 
added: "It's rather devastating to a candidate like myself to see such a lack 
of support from the party. I don't really think it's good to perpetuate that 
negativism." 
</P>
<P>
Balmages said the 1990 slate of Democratic candidates in Orange County is one 
of the best ever offered to voters. In every race, he said, the quality of the 
Democratic candidate is superior to the Republican incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, the candidates should look beyond 1990 for success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm encouraging everyone to run again and again, as long as it takes to win in 
Orange County," Balmages said at a luncheon for nearly 300 delegates, who also 
heard a speech from Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Kevin Gardner, running against Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La Habra), 
agreed with Balmages that Orange County Democrats are in a "building process" 
and that he hopes his current campaign will at least strengthen his chances in 
a future bid. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't tell people I can't win, but the odds are against me," he said. "I may 
not achieve the ultimate goal of winning, but there is a lot to be said for 
laying groundwork for the future." 
</P>
<P>
The one seat Balmages targeted for a Democratic victory this year belongs to 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove). Balmages noted that Pringle, who is 
facing Democrat Tom Umberg, was involved in the county Republican Party's 
decision in 1988 to hire uniformed guards at several polling places on Election 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our job to make sure Curt Pringle pays the price for what he did," 
Balmages said. "Tom is running against a guy who stole the election in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
Umberg did not attend the convention. He was recently activated by the Army 
Reserve for two weeks of duty in the California desert in connection with the 
national military mobilization to counter Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its Republican domination, Orange County's Democratic population of 
about 363,000 voters is the party's fourth-largest in the state. Republicans, 
however, have a commanding 56% to 34% edge in registration. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk), whose Los Angeles County district dips 
into Buena Park and Cypress, is the county's only elected Democrat ranked 
higher than mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In his morning speech, former chairman O'Neill reminisced about the party's 
heyday. 
</P>
<P>
"One day in 1977, a majority of the county's voters were Democrats -- can you 
believe that?" he asked. Former Gov. "Jerry Brown won the county by about 
60,000 votes. Now that's hard to believe today. We've got to do that again." 
</P>
<P>
Balmages followed: "Our goals are modest this time. Next time they won't be so 
modest."

AIRPORT'S STAFF SETTLES IN AT NEW 'TAJ MAHAL';

In the tradition of trying harder, the Avis Rent-a-Car employees sat 
cross-legged on the floor of John Wayne Airport's new terminal Saturday, 
happily sorting through a pile of dusty computers and tangled wires. 
</P>
<P>
The crew was in the process of moving the guts of the computer system from the 
company's cramped trailer and into its new home in the lobby of the $63-million 
Thomas F. Riley Terminal in time for its opening this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"The move so far has gone surprisingly smooth," said Avis district manager Pam 
Walker, 33, of Dana Point, as a co-worker labored to make a used computer 
terminal look presentable for the thousands of people expected to pass through 
the terminal today. 
</P>
<P>
"We want our customers to have a pleasant experience," she said. "It's like 
moving to the Taj Mahal." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with its immaculate marble-and-glass walls, state-of-the art 
information system and trendy food court, the new terminal was a welcome sight 
for hundreds of airport workers who spent Saturday moving out of the cramped, 
23-year-old Edward J. Martin Terminal, long considered an anachronism in 
fast-growing Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Today, thousands of travelers are expected to line up at the long rows of 
sparkling ticket counters at the 337,900-square-foot terminal -- part of a 
$310-million airport expansion -- to be processed through the airport in a 
style never before known here. 
</P>
<P>
Hours before the official closing of the aging facility about 10 p.m. Saturday, 
airport officials and employees of the various concessions went through the 
Riley terminal, testing everything from fire alarms and elevators to 
chrome-plated beer taps and automated french fry cookers. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, the long-awaited transition went with little or no trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"The tenants feel confident that they will be ready to open on time," said Alan 
Murphy, airport project director. "We don't envision any problems at all." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with activities in recent months -- when construction workers 
hammered, sawed and riveted -- workers concentrated Saturday on the seemingly 
endless finishing touches. 
</P>
<P>
Some stood on high ladders wiping the acres of glass that afford a wide-angle 
view of the airport runway. Others spent the day cutting fruit garnishes, 
vacuuming the brown, speckled carpet or filling drawers with paper supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mostly housecleaning stuff today," Murphy said Saturday, adding that 
there will be no ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the first day. "Tomorrow it'll 
be business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Here and there, last-minute touches were completed: Plants were buried in the 
topsoil outside the terminal, forgotten electrical sockets were screwed into 
walls, traffic signs were posted and misplaced boards were retrieved from the 
as-yet-unused sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
At 2 p.m., electrician Craig Wood was in the middle of wiring a series of 
silent alarms that will alert the Sheriff's Department when an unauthorized 
person enters one of the "jetways," the covered passageways that connect the 
airliners with the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they just decided to do it at the last minute," he said of the alarm 
activations. 
</P>
<P>
In another part of the terminal, electrician Chuck Kiefer of Huntington Beach 
was drilling large holes into electrical plates that did not fit electrical 
sockets at one of the two McDonald's outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone sent us the wrong parts," Kiefer said. "So it's modification time, or 
McDonald's doesn't cook anything tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The only area not ready for opening is the VIP lounge for American West 
Airlines. That facility, on the terminal's third floor, will be ready Friday, 
designer Bob Branch said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this stage in the game, we don't want to rush it," Branch said as 
cabinetmakers debated the exact location of the lounge's beer tap. "We just 
want to make sure its all spit shined." 
</P>
<P>
Some airport employees remained bittersweet about the changeover. They 
acknowledged that the amenities at the new terminal will make flying into the 
county more pleasant. Nevertheless, some sighed about the passing of the old. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of us might miss that little old country airport," said Emma 
Erving, 61, a member of the airport's security team. "This one is so awesomely 
big. It has an indifferent feel to it." 
</P>
<P>
That sentiment was shared by Continental Airlines sales agent Pat Paine, who 
came to John Wayne Airport three years ago to get away from the hustle and 
bustle of Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so small that everybody knew each other," Paine said while she tried to 
figure out how to operate the high-tech computer equipment at the new check-in 
counter. "Here, no one will see anyone anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The melancholy mood was shared by now-unemployed workers at Delaney's 
restaurant, which closed permanently after the lunch rush. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the last of the beer," bartender Keith Underwood announced to his 
fellow employees, who sat in a corner of the well-worn bar and reminisced 
fondly about long shifts, grouchy customers and bad tips -- as well as the 
strong camaraderie they developed over the years.

The new and improved John Wayne Airport opens its doors officially today. The 
focal point of the $310-million airport project is the new domed Thomas F. 
Riley Terminal. It is 12 times as big as the old terminal, airport officials 
say, adding that there will now be more daily flights, a wider selection of 
destinations and the ability to handle double the number of passengers who flew 
into Orange County in the past.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: THE 100-YARD TARMAC DASH JOINS COUNTY'S LIST OF BYGONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The phone call from my editor came at 9:15 p.m. one night. "Can you catch a 
9:30 plane to Phoenix?" 
</P>
<P>
I live about 5 miles from John Wayne Airport, and if I pushed the speed limit, 
I could possibly get there before the plane left, I replied. Why? 
</P>
<P>
No time to discuss the assignment now, the editor said: "We already made a 
reservation for you. Get on the plane and call us from Phoenix." 
</P>
<P>
My adrenaline was racing almost as fast as my car's engine as my husband drove 
me to the terminal's doorstep, depositing me just a few feet from the ticket 
counter. The airline workers were less flustered than I. They smiled, calmly 
prepared my ticket and called for the plane to wait for one more passenger. I 
ran across the Tarmac as the door to the jet popped open, just for me, and we 
were off. Fifteen minutes after that phone call, I had caught a plane; a few 
hours later, I got the story. 
</P>
<P>
I doubt that a reporter or anyone else will be able to catch a plane in quite 
the same way beginning today, when the new, improved, $63-million passenger 
terminal at John Wayne Airport opens its doors. No longer will we rush through 
a tiny terminal, across the asphalt and up staircases pushed against planes. We 
will navigate our way through a stylish facility 12 times larger, and the trek 
across the Tarmac will be replaced by a walk along enclosed jetways, just as 
those found at nearly all metropolitan airports these days. 
</P>
<P>
The old terminal was cramped, outdated, worn -- and personal. The new one 
promises to be big, modern, glitzy -- and impersonal. Kind of like Orange 
County itself, as it has grown through the years. 
</P>
<P>
I insist to newcomers in the newsroom that I am much too young to be considered 
an old-timer in this county. But the truth is, I have seen incredible changes. 
My family moved here in 1961; our house had a view of a huge open field that is 
now the Westminster Mall. I remember walking to school past fields of cabbage 
and tomatoes -- expanses of land now occupied by homes and mini-malls. Many of 
the now-jammed freeways had not been built. If we wanted to see a play or a 
movie premiere, we drove to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I can't remember when I caught my first flight out of John Wayne Airport -- 
then named Orange County Airport -- but it could not have been for a trip 
farther than to the Bay Area. For years it was unheard of to fly out of state 
from Orange County. And while the terminal certainly did not appear to be state 
of the art, neither did it seem to be a Third World airport, as it has been 
described. It was just Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen years ago, when I flew off to college in Columbia, Mo., I took it for 
granted that my journey would begin at Los Angeles International Airport. Last 
week, as I made arrangements for my first return to my alma mater since 
graduation, I was amazed to find that my family can depart from Orange County's 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
That amazement continued as I was sent out to the airport last week for a story 
on the old terminal. Many of the travelers I interviewed came from or were 
headed to Minnesota, Dallas, Houston -- places that never used to be listed 
among the airport's arrivals and destinations. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the now-vacated terminal is uncertain, the subject of ongoing study 
by the county. One possibility is to use the building for general aviation 
offices and services. Whatever the decision is, I hope it includes keeping the 
second-story outdoor observation deck open to the public. There have been times 
when I've driven with my young son to the airport, not to catch a flight but 
just to stand up there and watch the planes -- big and small -- take off and 
land, while passengers walk to and from their flights. It's one of the best 
people-watching spots in the county. 
</P>
<P>
A co-worker -- a relative newcomer from the East Coast -- wonders how people 
can feel nostalgic about the dingy little terminal. After she flew out here the 
first time, she told friends back home that it was "hard to take a place 
seriously that has a statue of John Wayne in its airport." 
</P>
<P>
I'm not consumed with nostalgia over the old terminal. It was hugely unpleasant 
to walk across the airfield to catch a flight in the rain. And I remember one 
weekday morning when, waiting for a first-out flight, the waiting area was a 
claustrophobic crush of business travelers and briefcases, with not one spare 
seat or square foot of standing room to be found. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if I ever again get a late-night call asking me to hop on a plane that 
is leaving in 15 minutes, I wonder whether the dash would be successful. In my 
rush, I'd probably drive to the wrong level at the new two-story terminal or 
enter at the wrong end. And if you have to run across an airport to catch a 
flight, nothing beats the footing of Tarmac.

CANDIDATES FOR COUNCIL AS VARIED AS CITY ITSELF;

ELECTION: FOUR INCUMBENTS FACE CHALLENGERS WHO ARE BREAKING AWAY FROM THE IMAGE

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is fitting that residents of Santa Ana -- the largest and most diverse city 
in Orange County -- get to select from a varied group of challengers and 
incumbents in this year's city election. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
An automotive engineer with a passion for music is running against the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In one council race, a two-time challenger for the U.S. Senate is taking on the 
youngest school board member ever elected in the city, as well as an incumbent 
who is a high school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
A Latina with a Cinderella background is going against an up-and-coming 
attorney and the incumbent, a swap meet operator, in another council race. 
</P>
<P>
In the third council race, a diminutive woman with a dramatic speaking style is 
walking neighborhoods to snare votes from the incumbent, a muffler shop 
employee who once fought City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new breed of people who are not tied to any special interest groups," 
said Rueben Martinez, former treasurer for the county's Democratic Party and an 
observer of Santa Ana politics for 12 years. "They are knocking on doors and 
talking about the city they care about." 
</P>
<P>
There are three council seats and the mayor's seat up for reelection on Nov. 6. 
Daniel H. Young faces one challenger for the two-year mayoral term, while three 
incumbent council members battle five candidates for their seats. In Ward 6, 
the southern portion of the city, Richards L. Norton has two challengers. In 
central Santa Ana -- Ward 2, the oldest section of the city -- incumbent Ron 
May has two opponents. And in Ward 4, the lower east side, Miguel Pulido has 
one challenger. 
</P>
<P>
With two months before the election, challengers and incumbents are testing the 
political waters by finalizing campaign strategies and beginning their 
door-to-door neighborhood walks. 
</P>
<P>
Mayoral candidate Richard G. Moser is best known at City Hall for throwing a 
birthday party for himself in August and inviting all the council members to 
attend. He knows his chances are slim to win against Young, one of the most 
visible politicians in Orange County. But Moser said he is trying, 
nevertheless, because he believes that the issues of crime, homelessness and 
eminent domain are not being addressed by the City Council. He has set a $1,000 
spending limit, and in his statement, Moser posted his home phone number and 
asked voters to call him. 
</P>
<P>
The usually outspoken Young is taking a kid glove approach to his challenger. 
Instead of knocking Moser, the mayor is concentrating on the need to revitalize 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that Santa Ana is going to have an opportunity to pick 
people who are very different from each other this year," Young said. "They 
won't have a problem in making distinctions." 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Norton, a swap meet operator, likes the idea of diverse candidates, 
even though two of them are determined to take over his seat. 
</P>
<P>
'When I first ran, we always got the same kind of candidates from the Old 
Guard, very traditional and very bureaucratic," Norton said. "Now everyone has 
a shot at being on the council." 
</P>
<P>
His challengers are Irene Martinez-Griffiths, president of the Mexican-American 
Women's National Assn. of Orange County, and attorney Glenn Mondo, who 
specializes in real estate cases. 
</P>
<P>
Mondo has asked the attorney general's office to investigate whether Norton 
broke a state law prohibiting elected officials from accepting discounts from 
transportation companies. In July, Norton accepted an airline ticket upgrade 
from coach to first class. Norton said he got the upgrade because a ticket 
agent discovered that he and his wife were on their honeymoon trip. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking office, Norton has found himself immersed in controversy. His own 
wedding became a political dart because he had to return several gifts that 
cost more than the $250 limit allowed by the city charter. 
</P>
<P>
Mondo asserts that Norton has a "pattern" of saying he does not know he is 
violating the law. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it is funny sometimes, and somehow it seems it can't be all that 
harmful," Mondo said. "But his actions show he is somebody who doesn't 
understand the seriousness of public office, and that's why I'm concerned with 
that kind of conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Norton shrugs off the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rubbish," Norton said. "All these charges come from political people and 
have no merit. They can charge me with anything they want, there's no substance 
to it." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Norton has hired political consultant Harvey Englander, whom he 
once called a "sleazy political consultant known for smear campaigns" in his 
1988 political flyers. Englander handled Councilman Daniel E. Griest's campaign 
against Norton. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Martinez-Griffiths, a program coordinator for a nonprofit community 
organization, already has begun walking neighborhoods. Martinez-Griffiths, who 
married at age 14 and worked her way through night school as a teen-ager, said 
she hopes to win despite little name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking the campaign to the people," she said. She is following a strict 
strategy of meeting residents 3 1/2 hours every weekday and all day on 
weekends. "I'm not getting myself involved in the political talk. I'm making 
myself visible to the people and developing support instead." 
</P>
<P>
In another ward, May and his strongest challenger, Robert L. Richardson, have 
been bickering endlessly, even in their campaign statements. Richardson, a 
school board member, asserts in his statement that "the incumbent's do-nothing 
attitude has contributed to the decline of the quality of life in Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
May, a Santa Ana High School history teacher, declared that Richardson has 
special interests as an assistant to Orange County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. 
May wrote that his opponent "has serious conflicts of interest from his county 
job that could keep him from representing you." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Banuelos, a senior citizen counselor for the city, is the dark horse of 
the three. A former Pacific Bell employee, Banuelos ran for U.S. Senate in 1986 
and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Banuelos is the only candidate who did not file a campaign statement, included 
in sample ballots mailed to registered voters, detailing where he stood on 
issues. He said he wanted to save the $700 statement fee so he could spend it 
on campaign mailers. In an interview, Banuelos said he wants to improve the 
city's senior citizens' food program and increase money for community services. 
</P>
<P>
Coween Dickerson, a fiery business systems analyst, is incumbent Pulido's sole 
challenger. In recent council meetings, Dickerson, who is 4-foot-8, has 
literally stepped onto a footstool to speak into the microphone and address the 
council on subjects such as the council's rejection of a cable consultant 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
She says she is not a "professional politician seeking higher office like the 
incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
In his campaign statement, Pulido declares he is proud of his four years in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"Each time I see a freshly painted, non-graffiti-filled wall, I am proud. And I 
wholeheartedly accept and embrace my reputation as someone who is stingy with 
taxpayer dollars," Pulido said in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
As for Dickerson's assertion that he has done little for the city, Pulido 
replied in an interview, "I think I've done a pretty good job." 
</P>

HOLD OFF ON FUNERAL PLANS FOR BABY GIRL, GROUP TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans by a group of church volunteers to provide a funeral for a newborn girl 
found dead Thursday at the UCI Medical Center in Orange have been put on hold, 
according to the Orange County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, parishioners from St. Bonaventure Catholic Church in Huntington 
Beach, led by Janet Perricone, arranged for a donated burial plot and services 
for the infant, and a local mortuary offered a casket. 
</P>
<P>
That same day, police located a teen-age girl who they believe is the mother. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman, whose name was not released because she is a minor, remained 
under psychiatric observation Saturday at UCI Medical Center, hospital 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Perricone said Saturday that the coroner's office informed her that if no 
family member claimed the child's body, it could be released to a mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Cullen Ellingburgh said Saturday that the coroner's office will 
ask the county to look for relatives of the baby, and if any are found, they 
will be permitted to claim the body. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the mother is not competent to make a decision regarding the body, 
Ellingburgh said, "her family members may want to act on her behalf." 
</P>
<P>
Perricone said she acted following a report that, if unclaimed, the child's 
body would be disposed of as medical waste. 
</P>
<P>
It "was amazing . . . that people responded in such a beautiful way, so 
generously," she said, referring fellow church members' response to her efforts 
to arrange a funeral.

OUSTED INDIANS PROTEST AT MISSION

<P>
About 25 members of the Juaneno Indian tribal group, angry that they have been 
barred from holding monthly meetings at Mission San Juan Capistrano, showed up 
at the mission Saturday to protest, then decided to avoid confrontation and 
meet peacefully at another location nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Indian leader David Belardes had vowed earlier to force his way into the 
mission gymnasium, where the Juanenos have been meeting for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said Saturday, he then called Lt. Dan Martini of the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department and promised not to cause trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Belardes and Msgr. Paul M. Martin of the mission have recently been at odds 
over treatment of Juanenos who work on the mission grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess Father Martin wants to extend his personal vendetta against me to all 
the Juaneno people," Belardes said at the gathering outside the mission. 
</P>
<P>
However, Robert McCreary, a spokesman for Martin, denied that there was 
anything personal involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a decision made independent of Mr. Belardes," McCreary said. "This 
parish has grown from about 600 people to about 3,000. We decided we could no 
longer allow non-parish groups to use the mission grounds as a meeting place."

MIKE PENNER: THIS DRAMA RAISING A FEW SPARKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Today's after-school special, "The Sparks Keep Flying: A Tale of Teen-Age 
Runaways," is brought to you by a grant from Mater Dei High School, where the 
only thing more important than winning football games is winning basketball 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Our cast: 
</P>
<P>
Derek Sparks, star high school running back who moves to California and can't 
believe all the friends he has. 
</P>
<P>
Leland Sparks, Derek's cousin, a slick quarterback/wide receiver but a troubled 
student. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Sparks, Derek's ever-attentive uncle and former legal guardian. Also a 
big Michael Jackson fan. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Sparks, another uncle. 
</P>
<P>
June Sparks, another Sparks, and a key one. She is Derek's mom -- the latest to 
get caught up in the Wharton, Tex.-to-Santa Ana Gardens migration craze. 
</P>
<P>
John Hazelton, football coach and middle man. 
</P>
<P>
Steve and Susie Goldbaum, good neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
George Giannini, Montclair Prep football coach who gets to borrow Derek for one 
season and one game. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Porter, new principal at Mater Dei High, a school that served a one-year 
probation in 1988-89 for illegal inducements given a freshman quarterback at 
Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Rollinson, embattled Mater Dei football coach with an 0-2 record, some 
hyperactive boosters and a sorely deficient running game. 
</P>
<P>
Our story: 
</P>
<P>
A wicked wind howls through the streets of the tiny town of Wharton. Dust 
blows. Tumbleweeds roll. This is no-man's land -- certainly no place for a 
young man like Derek, who, as Uncle Jerome has noticed, has an uncommon gift 
for carrying a football long distances. 
</P>
<P>
Uncle Jerome lives in Inglewood, not far from the Forum, where he runs a carpet 
cleaning business. One day, he makes the acquaintance of Coach Hazelton, whose 
Banning High football team has a long and storied winning tradition. Coach 
Hazelton wants to keep it that way. When Jerome mentions his nephews, Derek and 
Leland, Coach Hazelton invites Jerome to stand on the sidelines during Banning 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome likes what he sees. He arranges for Derek and Leland to visit the 
school. He arranges for Derek and Leland to enroll in the school. Banning, 
however, decides to make a coaching change and while Derek is rushing for 1,394 
yards as a sophomore, Coach Hazelton is out job hunting. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Coach Hazelton finds work as an assistant at Montclair Prep in Van 
Nuys. Montclair Prep is a nice school, much nicer than Banning, where June has 
heard stories about gangs and guns. Jerome does some investigating. He knows 
Derek could play for Coach Giannini -- by this time, Derek could probably play 
for Coach Paterno -- but Jerome wants to know about Leland. How about 
quarterback? Leland's credentials, according to Jerome: He played "some 
quarterback in ninth grade" and could "dance like Michael Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep's principal tells Jerome that Michael Jackson once attended the 
school. "Oh! That's good," Jerome exclaims. Jerome is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, more arrangements are made. Derek agrees to transfer to Montclair Prep 
under one condition -- he is allowed to live with Uncle Eric. No problem. 
Montclair Prep has a boarding-school license; Derek, Eric and Leland can share 
an on-campus apartment. The sooner the better. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, all is well. Derek and Leland lead Montclair Prep to a 12-1 
season. Only a junior, Derek rushes for 1,944 yards and 35 touchdowns. Coach 
Giannini knows he has something special. So does every Division I football 
coach in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing lasts forever, not even in Van Nuys. In early 1990, Montclair Prep 
approves a building expansion, which means the Sparks' on-campus apartment is 
razed. The Sparks split -- Leland and Eric find new quarters off campus, Derek 
hooks up with the Goldbaums, whose son, John, also plays football for Montclair 
Prep. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome doesn't like this setup. He likes it less when a county juvenile court 
declares Derek an abandoned minor and grants the Goldbaums legal custody. 
</P>
<P>
Tension mounts. Because Montclair Prep made Leland repeat the 11th grade, he 
has to petition the Southern Section for a fifth year of eligibility in 1990. 
Montclair Prep travels to Hawaii to play its season opener and two hours before 
kickoff, Jerome gets the word: Leland is declared ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Derek plays in the game, Leland does not. Afterward, Jerome makes a decision: 
Aloha, Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
Events happen quickly. The Goldbaums relinquish custody of Derek and Jerome 
pulls both nephews out of school. Somehow, Mater Dei gets involved. Doesn't 
Mater Dei always get involved? (For additional reading, please see Tom Lewis, 
Mike Mitchell, Stu Thomas and Dan O'Neil.) One day, June Sparks awakens in 
Wharton. Next, she's living in a house two blocks from Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
A new legal guardian! Welcome to Orange County, Derek Sparks. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section commissioner Stan Thomas, however, remains suspicious. He 
demands a hearing along with a study of grade transcripts and Mater Dei's 
admission policy before Derek goes anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei is a Catholic school and the commissioner notes that neither Derek 
nor Leland is Catholic. No problem, says Principal Porter, who issues a press 
release that states: "Unlike some private schools, Mater Dei admits a wide 
range of students in respect to abilities, ethnicity and religion." This 
includes the abilities to run, block and score touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
It is Thursday. Derek has been practicing with the Mater Dei team for three 
days and attending classes for one. Mater Dei plays Tustin that night, but the 
commissioner refuses to clear Derek to play until his transcripts are signed by 
the Montclair Prep principal and reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Gary McKnight, Mater Dei basketball coach, athletic director and something of 
an expert on student transfers, is dispatched to Montclair Prep to make sure 
the papers are signed. Mission completed, McKnight is to phone Principal 
Porter, who is to phone the commissioner. Once Derek is cleared, Porter is to 
phone his assistant principal, who is waiting at the football game to give 
Coach Rollinson the word. 
</P>
<P>
Says Coach Rollinson: "The minute he's eligible, he's in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Derek is on the sidelines, suited up, stretching, waiting for the phone call. 
Cut to close-up of phone. At last, it rings. But the news is bad: The 
transcripts are signed but the commissioner wants another day to look them 
over. Derek is forced to cool his heels. Mater Dei is forced to absorb a 27-3 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, the commissioner announces that Derek's grade-point average for 
the spring semester was below the 2.0 eligibility requisite. No problem, Mater 
Dei says. Derek will just be placed on academic probation, meaning he can play 
until the end of the fall semester, which ends, conveniently, just after the 
football playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei football is saved! 
</P>
<P>
Derek Sparks finds a home! 
</P>
<P>
And everybody lived happily ever after? 
</P>
<P>
Only their consciences will know for sure.

<P>
UNIVERSITY PLAYER'S DETERMINATION REMAINS LOUD AND CLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Manny Moscoso rushed onto the field Friday night with his University High 
School teammates, surrounded by the sounds of football. 
</P>
<P>
Cheerleaders chanted. Fans cheered. Coaches shouted and swore. Tubas played. 
Horns blew. 
</P>
<P>
All Moscoso heard, though, were the voices running through his head. The 
17-year-old senior is hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
"I just try to remember all the plays," he says. "I just try to think positive 
and to remember which way I should go." 
</P>
<P>
Usually Moscoso, the team's starting center, remembers well. Friday night, he 
played well in the Trojans' 24-21 loss to Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Because Moscoso cannot hear the quarterback's call, he relies on a strong nudge 
to signal the snap. 
</P>
<P>
"I always have to remind him to tap me harder," Moscoso says of Trojan 
quarterback Brian Vail. 
</P>
<P>
Moscoso, who was born in Peru, lost his hearing when he was 9 months old. He 
was born with anoxia, a total deprivation of oxygen. Doctors did not think he 
would live. At nine months, as a result of the anoxia, doctors believe, Moscoso 
had a viral infection and a high fever, causing his deafness. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 3, Moscoso and his family moved to Los Angeles. The 
hearing-impaired programs were better there, his mother, Rosa Moscoso, was 
told. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, Moscoso never tried football until high school. As a 
freshman, he wrote an essay in English class about how he wanted to play 
first-string varsity football by his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers and coaches all said no way," Rosa Moscoso said. "They said they 
didn't want him to be disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
But Moscoso was undaunted, and with the support of his family, began working 
toward his goal. His younger brother, Juan, a junior defensive tackle at Mater 
Dei, was especially supportive, Manny said. 
</P>
<P>
"Manny's just always had a lot of guts. If he sees a challenge, he's going to 
take it, and football was one of the biggest challenges," Juan said. "He 
figured if he took on football, he could take on anything." 
</P>
<P>
With a set of weights in the family's garage, and a younger brother to 
scrimmage with, Moscoso developed his skills, and his competitive spirit. Juan 
says one of his brother's favorite practices is hitting the walls of his 
bedroom or hall with his forearm, something both boys enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the two compete to see who can hit the wall harder. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents don't like it, but when we put holes in the wall, we fix them," 
Juan said. "Usually, we go for a wall with a strong beam in it." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Manny played sparingly at nose guard. This is his first season on 
offense. Although University has had deaf players on its team before -- the 
school has the largest hearing-impaired program in Orange County -- Moscoso was 
its first offensive starter. 
</P>
<P>
Before Moscoso earned the starting spot, though, one issue that had to be 
settled was communication. 
</P>
<P>
All University's hearing-impaired athletes rely on full-time interpreters who 
work from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
At an afternoon practice last week, Carol Both and Dottie Large stood on either 
side of Coach Mark Cunningham, signing in his every word to Moscoso and Steve 
Mooney, a reserve wide receiver. Large, whose parents are deaf, says when 
athletes are at practice, in the locker room, weight room, or in games, at 
least one interpreter is there to help them communicate. 
</P>
<P>
After four years of signing football, Both and Large say they understand the 
terminology, though they still carry small notebooks to jot down unfamiliar 
plays or phrases they need to study. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything Manny needs to know, we need to know," Large said. 
</P>
<P>
Against Santa Margarita, Both stood near Cunningham or line coach Mark 
Takkinen, waving to Moscoso when he needed to be informed. At one point, 
Takkinen changed a play in mid-call, and Both waved frantically to get 
Moscoso's attention again. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey! Get Manny to look! Get Manny to look!" someone screamed. 
</P>
<P>
Takkinen turned toward Both and screamed the play: "Minnow! Minnow! What's the 
sign for Minnow!" 
</P>
<P>
Trying not to panic, Both quickly signed in "minnow," spelling out each letter 
by sign language. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham called a timeout, and Both signed the next play to Moscoso. 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, University running back Marc Walker dived in for a touchdown. 
The small University crowd went nuts. The band kicked in. "University," the 
announcer said, "has tied the score at 7!" 
</P>
<P>
Elated, Moscoso smiled, lifted his arms, touchdown style, and rushed toward the 
Trojan sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Silence does not lessen his joy. 
</P>
<P>
By finishing fourth Saturday at the Woodbridge Invitational, Heather Killeen, a 
senior cross-country runner at Valencia, proved she is back on track after two 
years of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
Killeen, who was the county's second-fastest finisher Saturday after Katella's 
Martha Pinto, underwent surgery for the removal of ovarian cysts last summer. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, Killeen took medication for the problem. But the 
medication's side effects, among them weight gain and sluggishness, adversely 
affected her running ability. She is no longer taking the medication. 
</P>
<P>
Now 20 pounds lighter, Killeen is training hard, feeling fit, and set on 
qualifying for the state championships in November. 
</P>
<P>
Killeen's time Saturday of 17 minutes 36 seconds, only two seconds slower than 
Pinto, trimmed more than a minute off her time from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Another comeback of sorts Saturday was that of San Clemente senior Terri 
Smythers. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Smythers, one of the county's most gifted runners, decided to 
retire from competition. She said the pressures she placed on herself to do 
well led to mental and physical burnout, and that she did not see herself 
wanting to race again in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But over the summer, Smythers changed her mind. By late August, she was 
training with the Triton cross-country team again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm coming back with the goal to have it be fun again," Smythers said. "I'm 
just going to try to relax, enjoy it, not get too caught up in how I do." 
</P>
<P>
At the Woodbridge meet, Smythers finished 35th. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt every little slope," she said of the mostly flat course. "It just felt 
like my legs were lead out there."

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: EVERYDAY PHILOSOPHY; 
</P>
<P>
EVEN GREAT THINKERS HAVE TO YELL FOUL WHEN OVERCHARGED ON A WATER BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WILL DURANT, the philosopher-historian, lived for nearly 40 years with his 
wife, Ariel, in a Spanish-style home on Briarcliff Road above Hollywood 
Boulevard. He died in 1981 at 96, only two weeks after Ariel. 
</P>
<P>
I visited the Durants once, after the publication of "The Age of Napoleon," the 
final book in their 11-volume "Story of Civilization." Dr. Durant answered the 
door himself, a short man with an unwrinkled pink face, a shock of white hair 
and a white brush mustache. Even shorter, Ariel peered at me over his shoulder 
like Tinkerbell. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Durant?" I asked perfunctorily. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's get one thing settled right now," he said. "Please call us Will and 
Ariel." 
</P>
<P>
Thus did the eminent Dr. Durant, a hero of mine since my college days, dispose 
of the distance between us. One hardly expects to call eminent philosophers by 
their first names. Nor does one think of eminent philosophers as having 
ordinary household problems like the rest of us. Dr. Durant, one would suppose, 
would hardly worry about his plumbing or his water and power bill. 
</P>
<P>
However, I have received a letter from R. W. Bernhard of Whittier, who enclosed 
a copy of a letter Dr. Durant wrote to the Department of Water and Power in 
November, 1977, complaining about his bill. Bernhard worked for the department 
for 35 years and recognized the historical value of the letter; he tried to get 
the original, but someone beat him to it. 
</P>
<P>
The letter read as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 Your bill for service of water and power to property at 5608 Briarcliff Road . 
. . is surprisingly high in the water charge. Your bill for the period June 
23-Aug. 23 was, for water, $32.05; for Aug. 23-Oct. 23 it is $71.92, a rise of 
$39.87, or over 100% increase. I have inquired as to possible leaks on our 
property; I am assured that there is no sign of a leak. We have had no 
exceptional use of water in the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Will you please send a man to check our meter and see if it is working 
normally? And will you check your records to see if you can certify this 
unusual charge? 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you, 
</P>
<P>
 Will Durant 
</P>
<P>
 Bernhard notes that "the inspection made by the department's representative 
revealed that the water meter had been over-read, and since the bill had 
already been paid, Will Durant's account was credited with the amount 
overcharged." 
</P>
<P>
It may be interesting to compare this letter, showing the practical side of Dr. 
Durant, with one he wrote me in 1979. Someone had asked me to name "the sage of 
Los Angeles," and after considering many candidates, I selected Dr. Durant and 
Ariel, as a pair, since one could hardly think of one without the other. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Durant wrote as follows: 
</P>
<P>
Dear Jack: 
</P>
<P>
 That was a pleasant game you played with us recently, nominating us as the 
Solon and Theodora of our time and neighborhood. In our saner moments, we know, 
of course, that wisdom is a repeatedly appearing and disappearing mirage on the 
road of learning and that the child knows as much of cosmic truth as Einstein 
did in the ecstasy of his final formula. So the best we can do is to seek 
perspective and modesty (which are almost definitive of wisdom) and to see the 
part or the moment in the light of the whole -- which the part can't ever see. 
I am alarmed to note how few of the dogmas dear to my youth have kept their 
charm through my plentiful but inadequate years. So I beg you to take me down 
from that statue, and receive me as a friend and reader, another babe playing 
games with the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Yours to the end, 
</P>
<P>
 Will Durant 
</P>
<P>
 P.S. Will in his usual modesty has refused to accept your high estimate of 
him. Nor can I accept your kindness in including me. I am just a contented 
follower and hope to continue as such. 
</P>
<P>
 Regards from 
</P>
<P>
 Ariel 
</P>
<P>
 Gentle as they were, Will and Ariel Durant were not the kind of people you'd 
want to overcharge. 
</P>
<P>
When I interviewed them, I asked if they were contemplating a 12th volume in 
their series. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always a little bit pregnant," Ariel said. 
</P>
<P>
"Volume XII," Will said dreamily, as if to himself. "The 19th Century. We might 
call it 'The Age of Darwin.' That was the most important event of the century. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
He came back to the moment; the self-mocking smile returned. "The body is a 
machine in which every organ has a computerized date for its collapse. Now, 
take the heart -- if you can guarantee me five more years of health . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Go to it, man," Ariel said. 
</P>
<P>
". . . I'll do the 19th Century." 
</P>
<P>
"Go to it." 
</P>
<P>
"At least," Will said, "it would give a meaning to every day. It's a great 
blessing to wake up in the morning and know what you have to do."

MAN BITES TOWN: A IS FOR AWFUL; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION, PUBLIC SCHOOLS DON'T PASS THE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

IT'S NATURAL at this time of year for young people to dread the turn of 
calendar pages that dictates a return to school. It is, perhaps, less natural 
for teachers to dread it, although nobody likes to kiss a three-month vacation 
goodby. 
</P>
<P>
But recent conversations with child-rearing friends have convinced me that our 
public schools now operate the way they would during the aftermath of an 
earthquake: Nobody's there except the people who have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
Public schools were the children's melting pot, constitutionally proclaimed so 
by Brown vs. Board of Education. Now, it seems as though half of the truly 
unpleasant well-paying jobs around here are held by parents grimly determined 
to save their kids from the pot, which has long since melted down. 
</P>
<P>
As a public school student, I encountered the standard number of good teachers 
-- two per school -- but I was able to convince at least one local university 
that I had received a semblance of an education. It was during my brief stint 
as a teacher, though, that I became truly educated about the ways of the public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
When I began to teach, I was young enough to talk to students as near-peers, 
which prompted this advice from the woman who hired me: "You'll never have a 
chance if you don't act 20 years older than you are."

A fellow teacher, old enough not to need that trick, had come up with an even 
cleverer distancing device: Every day, he wore a black three-piece suit to 
school, with a Phi Beta Kappa key clearly dangling from the watch pocket. 
Everybody I knew who made Phi Bete had stashed the key in a desk drawer and 
forgotten it. Once I asked a teacher who knew Black Suit why he insisted on 
flaunting his achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, that's not a Phi Beta Kappa key," she said. "It's a Phi Delta Kappa key." 
</P>
<P>
"Uh huh. What's Phi Delta Kappa?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's a national education honorary society." Ah. In other words, an 
organization devoted to giving out keys that look like Phi Bete keys. And 
school principals think Bart Simpson is a bad role model. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, these were more innocent days. Kids gathered in the bathroom to do 
downers, not crack. A young man expelled by another teacher ran into my 
classroom and punched me in the jaw; he didn't spray the room with 
automatic-rifle fire. 
</P>
<P>
But some things, I suspect, remain sadly the same. A high school senior sat in 
one of my classes, asking cogent questions. But he failed every test he took -- 
tanked them pathetically. Other teachers, consulted in the grove of canned tuna 
and cottage cheese that was the teachers' lounge, confided that the kid was 
just a dummy, not even worthy of the vaguely optimistic label of Educable 
Mentally Retarded (known to all the kids as the kiss of brain death -- as in, 
"Hey, you're an EMR!") 
</P>
<P>
Away from the bracing fragrance of solid-pack albacore, the truth turned out to 
be even grimmer. The kid had simply made it to the 12th grade without ever 
having been taught to read. 
</P>
<P>
What keeps the few good teachers -- true heroes who don't even get VA mortgages 
-- in the business is the irreducible satisfaction of working with "the kids." 
After all, at its worst, the way you're taught to do it, teaching is the 
distribution of a package of educational material to a procession of consumers: 
year after year, the same lesson plans, just new names on the seating chart. 
Either through wisdom or through ignorance (my way), some teachers insist on 
encountering and engaging those students where they are, working toward the 
curriculum together, as if for the first time -- the way a good parent teaches. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching -- once the province of women too squeamish for nursing -- has been 
"professionalized": Teachers with 20 years' service can now, in favored 
districts, earn almost as much as first-year paralegals. 
</P>
<P>
But the process also has cast an aura of pseudoscience around a function that 
every human is built to perform -- teaching something he knows to someone who 
doesn't. Learning, which we come similarly equipped to do, has been pigeonholed 
as something you achieve only under the supervision of trained professionals, 
who in turn are supervised by more trained professionals. Teachers and learners 
have become practitioners and clients, and very little teaching or learning 
goes on anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Compulsory public schooling hasn't been around all that long. It's been an 
experiment, and lately the rats are dying. Maybe it's time to try something -- 
anything -- else. When I left the profession, the public schools were a worse 
argument for a monopoly than cable TV. They still are. 
</P>
<P>
After all, if you watched the addresses at the end of "infomercials" while the 
announcer yelled them at you, you might eventually learn to read.

<P>
SMURF C WAS MAD-DOGGING the witness, disrespecting him with the sort of stare 
that might make a person permanently lose his train of thought. 
</P>
<P>
But this witness wouldn't be dis'd. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Kevin Glass rocked calmly in the witness chair and told the court how 
on Dec. 27 of last year he allowed detectives to strap a small recorder to his 
back and then strolled into San Diego's most dangerous gang turf, where he 
purchased two chunks of rock cocaine from Smurf C, also known as John Coleman 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Smurf C's face tensed. He glowered. One hand was cuffed to his chair, and he 
leaned forward and leveled his free hand at Glass like a striking cobra. 
</P>
<P>
But Glass -- dressed, as always, in blue, hair pulled back in braids -- just 
smiled and explained how Smurf C had signaled that he was offering a bargain by 
singing him a love song. 
</P>
<P>
" 'He's got a lot of love to give,' " Glass crooned in imitation, clearly 
relishing this new perspective on the justice system -- and the world, for that 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few weeks earlier, Glass could have walked into any of the 
Crip-controlled areas of southeastern San Diego and been greeted with 
high-fives and hugs. He was, after all, a respected homeboy, a Neighborhood 
Crip with a reputation to match his nickname: Baby Insane. Then last February, 
an interagency task force descended, arresting 70 Crips in the most successful 
gang sweep in San Diego's history. As the hearings and trials continued through 
the spring and into the summer, Glass' homeboys faced facts: Baby Insane had 
broken his Crip bonds and betrayed them. 
</P>
<P>
Each defendant was confronted with tape recordings of his transactions and a 
street-smart witness willing to point him out across a courtroom. Every one of 
the gangsters prosecuted in Operation Blue Rag either was convicted or pleaded 
guilty -- Smurf C got the maximum sentence for selling cocaine because of 
Glass' testimony last March. By August, San Diego's most violent gang was, at 
least for a while, out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Down in the neighborhood, only one question remained, the same question that 
defense attorneys had used in a futile effort to chip away at the credibility 
of the prosecution's key witness: Why had Baby Insane betrayed his homeboys? 
The cops must have had an awfully hard twist on him, it was suggested, some 
crime held over his head to coerce his cooperation. Or maybe he sold out for a 
few pieces of silver. 
</P>
<P>
In case after case, though, Glass rocked gently in the witness chair and shook 
his head. No, it wasn't a deal that turned him, he said. And there wasn't 
enough money on Earth to make him agree to spend the rest of his life as a 
walking bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, when defense attorneys pressed, Glass told the court, "I just wanted 
to do something different, something good instead of gangbanging," and the 
defendants leaned back with sickly smiles and shook their heads in disbelief 
and disgust. 
</P>
<P>
Other times, though, Glass just shrugged and gave a simpler answer: "I met 
Detective Birse." 
</P>
<P>
"He met Pat Birse, man," a prosecutor would later repeat. "He met the Buddha." 
</P>
<P>
IT IS ANOTHER spring night in "America's Finest City," and Detective Pat Birse 
is on a typical gang-unit hit-and-run blitz through the parts of San Diego that 
never make the travel brochures. With a dozen other cops, he quietly slips 
between two decomposing duplexes and moves in on a group of suspected Oriental 
Boy Warriors as they sit in a semicircle, illuminated by a back-yard campfire. 
In seconds, the young Asian men are up against a wall, getting frisked. Under a 
spotlight near the fire, two Chinese fighting fish -- one iridescent red, the 
other blue -- do a macabre dance in a glass jar. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, the detectives stop to watch the eerie spectacle in the jar. Some 
offer encouragement to one combatant or the other in the lopsided battle. Some 
simply stare, transfixed, as the fish struggle, nipping tiny pieces of flesh 
off each other. 
</P>
<P>
Then Birse steps into the light of the fire. Decked out, as usual, in brown 
cords, a black-and-tan letterman's jacket and cowboy boots, he watches the 
fight for a moment and then slips his fingers into the jar. Plucking out the 
losing fish, he drops it into a water-filled bowl and walks away. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, the unit is hard-charging through the streets again. 
Spotting a group of suspected drug dealers, Birse whips his blue Chevrolet 
Astrovan across the avenue and over the curb, pinning a cluster of young black 
men in his headlights. He jumps out and rushes them, gun drawn. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't move!" he shouts, displaying all the sensitivity of a feeding piranha. 
"I said don't move, (expletive)!" 
</P>
<P>
And there you have it, say people who know Birse -- the yin and yang of the 
Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Birse's nickname has anything to do, officially, with Eastern wisdom. 
An ex-partner, Ernie Trumper, nailed him with the name because of the way the 
Le Tigre knit shirts Birse favors bulge Buddha-like at the midsection. 
</P>
<P>
"I never liked that nickname, and I don't today," Birse will tell you, in a 
growl so consistently mellow that it inspires colleagues to offer up parodies: 
"This is Pat (Buddha) Birse, K-Jazz FM, sending you the best of Count Basie, 
all night long." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Flanagan Birse was born in the San Diego suburb of Pacific Beach in 
1947, the first of four children and the only boy. At 17, he joined the Marine 
Corps and spent from May, 1965, to May, 1966, in Vietnam. Leaving the Marines 
as a staff sergeant, Birse enrolled in San Diego City College and later earned 
an administrative justice degree from Chapman College in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the San Diego Police Department on July 11, 1969. As he worked his 
way through the ranks, Birse earned a reputation as a sort of one-man, 
good-cop-bad-cop combo: someone ghetto kids affectionately call Pat Pat, 
someone who stopped the escape of alleged child killer James Warren Bland by 
putting a bullet in his buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
The most impressive thing about Birse, though, is that he is a cop criminals 
can talk to. He gets them to tell him things they shouldn't; he gets them to do 
things that could get them killed. 
</P>
<P>
Birse learned the value of picking the criminal brain early on, by watching 
other detectives who had the knack. His insight into how bad guys think was 
sharpened in the mid-'70s during a long undercover assignment. To pass as a 
fence, he had to dress, act and think like a criminal. Birse played the part 
well. "I'd be standing in line at a hamburger place, and people would treat me 
like dirt." He began to get a glimpse of the world through a criminal's eyes. 
That turned out to be the key to interrogation -- and more. 
</P>
<P>
When Birse is the one being interrogated, he steers the conversation away from 
himself. The only approach to investigations is teamwork, he says as he sits at 
the cluster of gray desks he shares with three detectives in the police 
department's gang-unit office. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fake sincerity, especially with a street person," Birse says. Then 
he nods toward his partner, Gary Jaus, a soft-spoken 34-year-old, who directs a 
church bell choir when he's not rousting gangbangers. "That's why people talk 
to Gary, open up to him. Jaus studies people. . . . But he never loses respect 
for someone." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, of course, Jaus intervenes. "Everything he says, double it for him. 
I've never met anyone who understands the criminal mind as well as Pat." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the late '70s and early '80s, for example, San Diego's biker gangs 
began a shooting war over the booming trade in methamphetamine -- the white 
outlaw entrepreneur's equivalent of rock cocaine. As part of a team drawn from 
local, state and federal law-enforcement agencies, Birse assisted in turning 
several high-ranking members of the secretive biker groups. Major convictions 
resulted. 
</P>
<P>
Intent on continuing the pressure on gangs, Birse made it his business to keep 
an eye out for other informants. In 1984, he heard about Charming Charlie, 
checked his background and brought him in for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie was a real gangster. He was in the pen all his life," Birse says. "His 
brother was shot to death by the San Jose Police Department. He grew up in an 
orphanage. You'd look at him and say, 'This is a tough person.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Birse saw something else. "I just had a feeling about him," Birse says. So 
he started calling Charlie. Charlie would hang up. Birse would call again. 
</P>
<P>
"With a guy like Charlie, he's sizing you up," Birse says. "He's thinking, 'Is 
this person smart? Weak? A tough guy? What does he know?' " 
</P>
<P>
The next time Birse and Charlie got together to talk, Birse told him, "You know 
something? You have a kind heart." 
</P>
<P>
"He'd say 'Get away from me, man.' And I'd say, 'I need you. I need your help. 
And I know that underneath, you're a real good person. You have a good heart.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Charlie allowed a recording device to be strapped to his body, and 
with Birse and his team providing backup, approached well-known bikers, 
purchasing large quantities of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
When Charlie took the witness stand, ranking members of Hells Angels went to 
prison. "I wouldn't have done it with anyone but Pat," Charlie said recently 
from an undisclosed location where he lives under a new identity manufactured 
for him by the federal witness protection program. "One of the reasons I try so 
hard to do good now, to stay out of trouble, is I want Pat to have a high 
opinion of me. He really honestly cares about how I do." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Birse was assigned to the robbery detail. In his 20 years with the 
police department, his work had often taken him into San Diego's gang 
territory. He thought he knew the community well. But working daily on the gang 
crime of choice gave him a new perspective. "I'd never seen such a relatively 
small group commit so much crime in such a short period," he says now. "It was 
incredible how much violent crime the Neighborhood Crips were committing." 
</P>
<P>
So the Buddha joined a team and started looking around for someone to give him 
an inside look at how street gangs work. It wasn't long before he came across 
the name "Baby Insane." 
</P>
<P>
KEVIN GLASS WAS BORN in South-Central Los Angeles in May, 1966, less than a 
year after the Watts riots. He never knew his father. His mother died when he 
was 7. Glass thinks it was tuberculosis, he will tell you, his voice, usually 
cocksure, suddenly unconvincing and constricted. 
</P>
<P>
Glass' uncle, just a week out of prison on a marijuana conviction, drove to Los 
Angeles and took the boy to live with him in a modest east San Diego 
neighborhood, where Glass spent languid afternoons in a scrubby canyon nearby, 
plopping rocks into an irrigation runoff pond and scooping up wriggling black 
tadpoles. My "polliwog days," he says wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
It was indeed a time of metamorphosis. 
</P>
<P>
For at least three generations, Latino gangs have staked out turf in San Diego. 
In the early 1970s, convicted criminals from Los Angeles' black street gangs 
began showing up in San Diego; by some accounts, they were ordered there by Los 
Angeles authorities. Los Angeles' gang culture reproduced itself almost 
immediately. Southeastern San Diego was divided between sets of Crips and sets 
of Bloods, also called Pirus. The Crips wore blue, the Bloods wore red, and, 
just as in Los Angeles, each gang harbored a homicidal hostility toward the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Glass wound up living in Neighborhood Crip turf. He was small for his age. His 
new friends started calling him Half Pint; the girls called him Little Pup. 
Neither name offered much of a psychological deterrent to the predators in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The way Glass tells it, when he was 8, he saw a more impressive name on the 
graffiti-splattered walls. In a sort of idle tribute, he began spray-painting 
Insane around town. One afternoon, while he held the paint can, the old 
gangster himself came by. 
</P>
<P>
"So you want to be Insane?" the O.G. asked. Suddenly, the homeboys hanging out 
with him -- Tray Dog, Crip Dog, Thai Stick, Salt Rock -- were wrestling Glass 
down while the others kicked and punched him, jumping him into the gang. 
"Nothing fierce or nothing," he says. "Nothing major." 
</P>
<P>
Convinced that Glass was a fighter, Insane took the boy by the arm and gave him 
a new nickname: Baby Insane. While Glass snuffled back a bloody nose, the O.G. 
completed the initiation: "Uphold this name," he told Glass. "Never do anything 
to betray Crip. Always protect your own. Never let anyone disrespect you. And 
always hold down the set -- the people in the neighborhood that are your 
homeboys are like your brothers." 
</P>
<P>
"I took it serious. You had to take it seriously," Glass says. "He was Big 
Insane. I was Baby Insane. From then on, it was, like, runnin' wild. I just 
adapted to the name." 
</P>
<P>
Baby Insane and his buddies got their first taste of derring-do by swiping 
fruit from neighbors' trees. Soon they moved on to stealing pop bottles from 
garages and cleaning out back-yard freezers. By his ninth birthday, Glass was 
smoking marijuana regularly and had tried PCP. Stealing cars came next, then 
home burglaries. Gradually, almost inexorably, Glass and his homies began 
riding the statistical undertow that says black men are 10 times more likely 
than white men to die at the hands of another and puts one in four black men 
behind bars or on probation or parole at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
From the time he was jumped into the gang, Glass made up for his small stature 
with a hair-trigger willingness to fight and keep fighting with lunatic 
abandon. The crease on his head is the work of a drive-by shooter. His elbow 
shows evidence of another bullet wound. He earned the scars on his back one 
night when a rival Crip set crashed a party he and some homeboys were attending 
and opened fire with shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
Glass tells the stories of these battles complete with the sound effects kids 
make when they're playing cops and robbers: "Peeow, peeow, peeow." His thinking 
on why he committed drive-by shootings has the same sense of unreality. "We 
didn't like Pirus, and we wanted to go kill some," he laughs. "We just didn't 
like 'em. We didn't want 'em around." 
</P>
<P>
Ask Glass if he ever shot anyone, and he gives a shrug. "I'm sure I did," he 
says. "But I didn't stick around to see if they got up or if they were dead." 
</P>
<P>
As the exploits grew more dangerous, the gang bond tightened. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go in to rob a store or something," Glass says, "and you've got someone 
watching your back with guns, if he ain't your friend, he might let someone 
come up to your back and cap you. Since I was the bagman, I trusted these 
people with my life because I didn't have no gun." 
</P>
<P>
One night when Glass opted not to go along, the owner of Winchell's jewelry 
store put up a fight. "My homeboy said, 'Shoot him.' " Another homeboy did. 
Five times. "You can imagine the bond they've got between them," Glass says. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of Neighborhood Crips started calling themselves the Mad Drivers and 
describing their crimes as do-or-die missions. By the time he was 13, Glass was 
doing a lot of them. 
</P>
<P>
One night, a few Mad Drivers decided they needed some money for the weekend. 
Glass, Cedrick (Crip Dog) Pratt and another homie easily stole a Lincoln 
Continental from a bar called the Round Table. About 8 p.m., they pulled their 
blue handkerchiefs -- the sacred symbol of Crips -- over their faces, 
brandished a shotgun and robbed a gas station in San Diego. They robbed a man 
at gunpoint as he came out of a restaurant. They held up a doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
With one person jabbing the shotgun in victims' faces and the others collecting 
the cash, they robbed a man in the parking lot of a K mart and several people 
in the parking lot of a Sears. At an "old people's club" in Chula Vista, Glass 
says, they made a man spread-eagle on the pavement and stole his money. 
</P>
<P>
"Can't you leave an old man $10 to catch a cab?" the victim pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
"No!" Crip Dog shouted. Then he tossed him a dollar bill. "Take the bus." 
</P>
<P>
Intoxicated with their success, they continued rampaging through San Diego and 
the surrounding towns. Figuring that the Continental was getting hot, they 
pulled up next to a red Pontiac Firebird at an intersection. Crip Dog stuck the 
shotgun through the window. "Freeze! Get out! Leave your keys and run!" 
</P>
<P>
Their next stop was a Kinney Shoes store. All three went in and ordered the 
clerks and patrons to lie on the floor. Glass cut the phone line; then they 
emptied the register and took off. 
</P>
<P>
With 23 armed robberies under his belt, Glass figured it was time to go home. 
His homies said they'd give him a ride. They drove up San Diego's Main Street, 
smack into a cluster of patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
"The chase was on," Glass says, calling out the names of streets they shot up 
and down. With the squad cars wailing behind them and a helicopter chattering 
overhead, Crip Dog turned off the road and into a cemetery, stuttering over 
grave markers toward an exit blocked by a single-crossbar gate. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to make it!" Glass shouted. 
</P>
<P>
"Duck!" Crip Dog yelled. 
</P>
<P>
The gate peeled off the car's top like a key taking the lid off a sardine can. 
The Mad Drivers were tossing their loot into the street when the topless 
Firebird hit a telephone pole. "I jumped out and ran up an alley and was trying 
to get into this girl's house," Glass says. "Then I heard click, click, click." 
Glass turned to face a battery of shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
"The cops had those metal flashlights. They beat me up pretty good," he says. 
"I was spittin' blood in the back of the police car." 
</P>
<P>
Glass spent 2 1/2 years at California Youth Authority on the charges stemming 
from the Mad Driver spree. While there, he took advantage of the corrections 
department's education program. He learned to arc weld. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year of his release, he put his new skill to work. He and some 
Neighborhood Crip buddies, who now called themselves the Uzi gang, cut through 
the metal door of a Leo's Stereo store. Glass was inside when two police cars, 
responding to the silent alarm, pulled up. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years old at the time, Glass got another 2 1/2 years at CYA, including 
a 90-day evaluation at Chino Institute for Men, a medium-security adult prison. 
In CYA, Baby Insane did OK for himself, building respect by fighting every 
Blood who even thought of dis'ing him. But Chino, with its gun towers and 
barbed wire and the distinctive sound of double gates slamming shut, was 
another world. 
</P>
<P>
Glass knew that if he didn't like Chino, he'd be even less thrilled with his 
next likely stop on the criminal migration: Folsom or the new Richard J. 
Donovan prison near the Mexican border. "It was all older people in those 
places. I'd have to prove myself all over again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Between his first and second convictions, Glass had returned to high school 
just long enough to father two daughters by two different girls. Sometimes 
Glass thought about whether his children would blame him for the circumstances 
of their lives: poor, unmarried mothers; an imprisoned father; a neighborhood 
where selling crack added up to a Horatio Alger opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Glass knew, there were only two ways of life: the street life he was 
born into and the straight life that surrounded him but remained absolutely 
out-of-bounds. Although he never much understood that other life, it intrigued 
him. So one night, he wrote a letter to the San Diego district attorney, 
telling him Baby Insane might be willing to offer some information. He never 
heard back. 
</P>
<P>
Released on parole in 1987, Glass got a work-furlough job at a hazardous-waste 
disposal firm at the 32nd Street Shipyard. Although Glass waffles here, police 
suggest that he also moonlighted in other equally dangerous, though less legal, 
pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a year into his parole, while Glass was down in the cavernous tanks 
of a big ship, decked out in a yellow jumpsuit, breathing bottled air and 
sucking up poison with a high-pressure hose, corrections-department officers 
visited his uncle's home. They left word for Glass to report to his parole 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The officer questioned him for about an hour, intimating that authorities had 
parole violations on him, including a dirty drug test. Then the office door 
opened and an intense man with a pot belly walked in and began pacing the room. 
</P>
<P>
Glass assumes a "Dragnet" voice when he recalls the meeting: "It was a sunny 
day in June. . . . Little did I know that Pat Birse was waiting to pounce." 
</P>
<P>
WHEN PAT BIRSE JOINED the robbery detail in 1988, San Diego's supermarkets were 
under siege. Detectives labeled the robbers the Git Down gang. The pattern 
seldom varied: Several young black men, armed with handguns and sawed-off 
shotguns, their faces concealed by blue bandannas, entered a Vons, an Alpha 
Beta or an Osco Drug Store and ordered everyone to lie on the floor. They 
demanded that the store manager open the safe while the cashiers emptied the 
registers. After filling a blue duffel bag with cash and money orders, they 
walked calmly out of the store, climbed into a car they had stolen earlier and 
sped away. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives working on the case, including Jaus, Jerry Wiggins and now 
Birse, had information that Neighborhood Crips were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Poring over computerized police records, piecing together who was in custody 
and who was out, Birse came across the name Kevin Glass, a.k.a. Baby Insane. In 
parole files, he unearthed Glass' letter to the district attorney. Baby Insane, 
he discovered, was an O.G. respected by his homies. The Crips were the only 
real family Glass had, and tests indicated that despite a life of dumb 
decisions, Glass had a very high IQ. 
</P>
<P>
Birse arranged for the invitation Glass had received from his parole officer. 
As Jaus and Wiggins recall the scene when Birse and Glass met, it was like a 
courting ritual, the street-smart criminal and the veteran cop circling each 
other, sizing each other up. By all accounts, Birse got the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
"He scammed me," Glass says now with admiration. Birse told him he was under 
arrest for a dirty test. 
</P>
<P>
"They just wanted to stop the robberies. He'd done his homework real well. I 
guess he figured I was ripe for picking." 
</P>
<P>
Holding the threat of a parole violation over his head, the officers asked him 
who was behind the supermarket robberies. Glass listened closely. The 
detectives knew more about him and his gang than Glass thought possible. And 
they actually treated him with respect. Glass decided that, just this once, 
he'd talk. 
</P>
<P>
Working with the information Glass provided, the detectives compiled enough 
evidence to send the Git Down gangsters to prison. Birse thanked the informant, 
praised him for helping the community and said, "If you want to keep in touch, 
please do." 
</P>
<P>
"It took me about a week to think about it, to figure out, do I want to do 
this? Do I want to betray Crip?" Glass remembers. "I've been shot. I've seen 
friends die. I've had friends die next to me. I've been to the hospital and 
cried. I've been to many, many funerals. There is a certain inner bond between 
me and Crip that I love." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand: "I'd never known a police officer before, friendly-wise," 
Glass says. And Birse treated him like a friend. "It wasn't like he'd come to 
me and say, 'Go do this, go do that.' He'd ask, politely, 'Kev, do you happen 
to know anything about this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Glass decided he would keep in touch with the Buddha. Young gangsters were 
eager to get the advice of Baby Insane on crimes they planned and to brag to 
him about the crimes they'd just committed. When a Crip called M-Loc killed a 
man, Glass phoned Birse and told him where to look for evidence. When a new Git 
Down gang crossed the county line and went on a rampage through San Clemente, 
Mission Viejo and El Toro, Glass filled in Birse and Jaus on his conversations 
with the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
But nowhere in any of the official reports on these crimes is there mention of 
an informant. The trust between Glass and Birse and the robbery detail grew. 
Meeting at coffee shops or riding together in unmarked cars, they talked for 
hours about their lives, about the ways their professions intersected. "I 
viewed him as a consultant," Birse says of Glass, who took great pride in 
showing the team every corner of the neighborhood, telling them the street 
names of all the homeboys, telling them where to find stolen cars, explaining 
how easy it was to steal shotguns from police cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Buddha became a sort of mentor for Glass. He brought him to 
his new, pink-stucco Spanish-style home in a manicured suburb of San Diego and 
introduced him to his wife and two daughters. When Birse's wife, Marilyn, 
finally met the legendary gangster, she shook her head: "But you're only a 
baby." One of Birse's teen-age daughters, a surfer, worried about him. "You're 
not letting my dad put you in danger, are you?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Danger was a matter of perspective. All of the original Mad Drivers and Uzi 
gang were in prison, Glass knew -- at least the lucky ones. Crip Dog Pratt, the 
balls-out graveyard driver from the robbery spree, had gone out one evening in 
1987 to rob a Domino's Pizza in National City. The manager shut the door and 
called for help. A blast from a police shotgun caught Crip Dog square in the 
head as he left the store. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that if I stayed in the gang and I stayed loyal to them, one of three 
things was going to happen," Glass says. "Either I was going to die, I was 
going to go to prison for the rest of my life, or I'd become a hard-core 
criminal. Robbing banks was the next step." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was no way to simply chuck the old life and walk away. "I was used 
to that adrenaline of doing robberies, doing drive-bys, hanging out with all 
the girls and selling dope." Playing cop, he discovered, was a little like a 
methadone program. 
</P>
<P>
In return for his help, the detectives gave Glass cash from the detail's 
informant fund -- $50 here, $100 there -- and occasionally cash from their own 
pockets as well. Then Glass came through with some information that proved 
particularly lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the late '80s, the trials of Sagon Penn embroiled San Diego in 
racial turmoil. Two juries had acquitted Penn of murdering a police officer, 
deciding that the attack was self-defense against a cop's brutality. Sagon's 
father, Thomas Penn, was among those who had charged that the case was a 
reflection of deep-seated racism in the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
At Birse's suggestion, Glass went to the Drug Enforcement Administration with 
the information that Thomas Penn was dealing large quantities of cocaine. When 
the elder Penn was convicted, the DEA treated Glass generously. 
</P>
<P>
Glass used part of his $4,000 DEA "reward" to buy a '73 Cutlass Supreme. He 
spent $400 on a pair of Cazal sunglasses and another $400 on a headstone for 
his mother's grave. 
</P>
<P>
As before, Glass' role in the case remained off the record. But it would only 
be a matter of time, Birse told him, until some young Crip noticed that hanging 
out with Baby Insane was as good as drawing a "Go to Jail" card. 
</P>
<P>
Birse told Glass about Charlie and the federal witness protection program and 
about how a grateful Establishment had set the former Hells Angel up with a 
whole new identity. He warned him that acceptance into the program wasn't a 
sure thing, but to Glass, the possibility looked like a secret passageway from 
the street life to the straight life. 
</P>
<P>
Would Glass be willing to wear a tape recorder, buy crack from his homeboys and 
then square off against them in court? Birse asked. 
</P>
<P>
Glass saw his bond with the Crips snap; his addiction to the street life would 
be cured cold-turkey by vengeful homeboys eager to gun him down. 
</P>
<P>
"I said yes," Glass would later testify, gently rocking in the witness chair. 
"And since then, we've been rocking and rolling." 
</P>
<P>
IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR,spurred by the stepped-up war on drugs, the San Diego 
district attorney's office, working with the police department and a hodgepodge 
of state and federal agencies, conceived Operation Blue Rag. The idea was to 
put away violent gangbangers by hitting their most common criminal sideline: 
selling crack. The targets would be the three most dangerous gang sets in San 
Diego: the Neighborhood Crips, the Linda Vista Crips and the West Coast Crips. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Birse transferred from the robbery detail to the gang unit and 
joined the Blue Rag team: at this point, Wiggins; Garland Peed, the deputy 
district attorney in charge of the case, and Glass. "As far as we were 
concerned, he was an equal member of the team," Birse says of Glass. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 6, the team made its first buy. Birse carefully strapped a 
sophisticated Swiss Nagra recorder, about the size of a Walkman, to Glass' 
back, running two microphones up to his chest. The team briefed him on the 
night's assignment in the back of Birse's Astrovan. The focal point was 30th 
and Imperial, a graffiti-scarred area of small businesses and burned-out shops 
in the heart of West Coast Crips turf. 
</P>
<P>
As Glass picked his way through the crowd on the corner, he spotted an alleged 
O.G. named Marcus Dawayne White -- Casanova to his friends. Glass had already 
told Birse that he thought Casanova was dangerous. Birse checked it out and 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The Nagra recorder picked up the sounds of the street and the $40 transaction: 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, loc, are you serving, cuz?" Glass asked in street slang. "Proper 40, 
cuz." 
</P>
<P>
"Forty, 40, 40," Casanova said. 
</P>
<P>
"Cuz, you know me, don't you? You know, I'm Baby Insane." 
</P>
<P>
"Exact," Casanova said. 
</P>
<P>
"Say, who you, cuz?" Glass asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Casanova." 
</P>
<P>
"Cas, oh yeah, cuz!" 
</P>
<P>
With two rocks in his hand, Glass walked off. Back in the van, the Blue Rag 
team was ecstatic. "Man, if we can buy from him, we can buy from anyone!" Peed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For the next two months, the team worked almost every night, sometimes sending 
Glass off to make two or three purchases. "It was almost like a job, you know," 
Glass said. The taped accounts of the operation are systematic: "The date is 
Jan. 2, 1990," Birse says in one, his mellifluous monotone making the narration 
sound like a radio drama. "The time is 20:34 hours, 8:34 p.m. We're at a secure 
location. A parking lot near the SDPD facility. . . . I just searched the 
confidential source's person. He's wearing a Dallas Cowboys sweat shirt, 
stone-washed jeans, white socks, brown shoes. He's wearing a black-and-blue 
Puma jogging-suit top. I placed an on-body recording-device tape recorder on 
his person. I searched all of his pockets. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Twice, on the operation's off nights, Glass succumbed to temptation and smoked 
crack. Twice, Birse locked him up. "It's like taking an alcoholic and asking 
them to go into bars every night," Birse says. "Somewhere down the road they're 
going to take a drink." 
</P>
<P>
Birse's biggest concern was that Glass would get made while he was wearing the 
Nagra. For Glass, it all came naturally. Birse and Wiggins often would cruise 
nervously past a buy scene just to keep Glass covered. On more than one of the 
tapes, Glass spots the van and shouts out the Crip code for police: "One time!" 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, homegirls would step up to him on the street and hug him. He'd 
push them off, muttering, "Get away, baby, you wanta mess up my clothes?" 
</P>
<P>
Only one incident really shook Glass. It occurred during the sort of sidewalk 
shakedown he'd been subjected to since elementary school. Glass and some 
homeboys were hanging out by an apartment building when the police department's 
Special Enforcement Unit came screeching up. Set up to combat gang violence, 
the unit uses no-nonsense tactics similar to those of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. When San Diego's gangsters see the unit coming, they shout, "Daryl 
Gates!" 
</P>
<P>
That afternoon, one homeboy smarted off, and a unit officer began "dishragging 
him -- shaking him like a dishrag, like a rag doll," Glass says. Meanwhile, 
another officer frisked Glass and found the beeper Glass carried to stay in 
touch with the Blue Rag team. The beeper went off. 
</P>
<P>
When the officer recognized the number appearing on the digital readout as a 
police phone, she demanded: "Why are they calling you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you know?" Glass answered, trying to be cool. 
</P>
<P>
She called over her partner. "Look at this number," she whispered. 
</P>
<P>
"She was making a big deal of it. She started getting really snotty. I thought 
I was burned," Glass says. Finally the officer backed off. 
</P>
<P>
To squash any suspicion, about a week later Birse rousted Glass while he was 
with gang members. Glass cast him a friendly glance. Birse was all over him. 
"What are you smiling at?" he snarled in his best bad-cop voice. "You know 
you're hanging around with a robber? A thug?" he asked Glass' companions. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-February, the Blue Rag team gathered to check their progress in their 
unofficial headquarters, a district attorney's office on the fifth floor of the 
county courthouse. On one wall was a poster from the film "Colors" that 
proclaimed, "In America's cities, people die for wearing the wrong colors." A 
computer-generated banner read: "Crush the Crips. Bleed the Bloods." 
</P>
<P>
Glass had made purchases from almost every West Coast Crip as well as a number 
of Neighborhood and Linda Vista Crips. It was time for the final phase of 
Operation Blue Rag to begin. For three days and nights in late February, a team 
of state, federal and local law-enforcement officials quietly swept through the 
streets of southeastern San Diego, arresting 70 gang members on charges of 
selling crack or for parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Rag team flew Glass and his girlfriend to another city to await the 
hearings and trials. In May, the couple had a daughter. Glass was in the 
delivery room, doing Lamaze. The only people who sent gifts and congratulations 
were law-enforcement officers. "Jaus is like a big brother to me; Wiggins is 
the uncle," Glass said. Of Birse, he adds, "If I'd ever known my real father, 
if I'd had a choice, I'd have pictured him just like Pat." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Glass' girlfriend: "Kevin is the son Pat never had." 
</P>
<P>
The couple named the Buddha as their daughter's godfather. 
</P>
<P>
ON MARCH 15, TWO DAYSbefore preliminary hearings began on the Operation Blue 
Rag cases, armed witness-protection guards escorted Glass back to San Diego. 
That night, the Blue Rag team reconvened in a secured hotel room and began 
preparing for the rush of hearings and trials in state court. 
</P>
<P>
When the hearings began, Glass was shuttled back and forth between San Diego 
and his temporary home. If accepted into the witness-protection program, Glass 
would get a new name, a fabricated background and a new start. As Birse had 
warned him, though, there was no guarantee that the program would let him in. 
So for most of the spring and summer, Glass lived in limbo, trying to 
understand who he was, who he had been, who he might become. "If I were on the 
streets, I'd be expected to uphold the Baby Insane name," he said one afternoon 
between hearings. "Now, in my life, I'm supposed to be a different person, but 
sometimes I have trouble." 
</P>
<P>
When he rode the bus in his new neighborhood, young gang members approached 
him, sizing him up, asking, "Say, Blood, what's happening, Blood?" 
</P>
<P>
"They keep saying 'Blood, Blood, Blood.' It's like I'm having a flashback," 
Glass said. "Sometimes I'll just snap. I'll say, 'I ain't no Blood. Stop 
calling me Blood!' And they'll say, 'What are you? You a Crip?' And I'll say, 
'No, but you'd best stop calling me Blood.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, it's going to wear off," Glass said confidently, tapping together 
his high top sneakers with the blue laces. 
</P>
<P>
While federal cases trailed into August, the last state case was heard in 
mid-June, when Marcus Dawayne White, a.k.a. Casanova, took the stand. Through 
his attorney, Casanova denied that he had sold Glass crack. 
</P>
<P>
But Glass and Birse packed a one-two punch. Glass, still looking every bit the 
gangster, gazed right at the jury and patiently defined the street slang of 
drug dealers; Birse described in his soothing Buddha voice the systematic way 
the Blue Rag team had pieced together its evidence. And when John Davidson, a 
deputy district attorney, slipped the cassette of the transaction into his boom 
box, Casanova's own mother could not testify that the voice was not her son's. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Casanova guilty. When the last federal case ended in mid-August, 
everyone against whom Glass testified had been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Out in the streets of southeastern San Diego, though, the verdict was split. 
Some argued that Blue Rag was all huggermuggering and hoopla; that the 
gangsters would soon be paroled and return to the impoverished life from which 
they'd come. But most in the community openly applauded Glass and the 
statistics to which he contributed. As of July, gang-related killings were down 
50% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
If opinions on Glass' actions were mixed, though, the sentence on the streets 
-- pronounced by friends and enemies alike -- was unanimous: "He's dead meat." 
</P>
<P>
"He put away some people that would have died for him," said a West Coast 
homegirl who calls herself Dimples. "He betrayed his homeboys." 
</P>
<P>
"Baby Insane -- that's not a name you think is going to be a snitch," muttered 
another young Crip. Then someone chimed in with a nearly universal Crip 
appraisal: "He just let his own self down. Ruined his life. The police, they 
through with him now, they ain't going to pay for his funeral arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
Glass' uncle, after kicking his own drug problem, dedicated his life to 
counseling inmates on the dangers of dope. He has not talked to his nephew 
since Glass began working as an informant. But he heard about Operation Blue 
Rag, and he's angry. He believes Glass was manipulated into making a possibly 
fatal decision. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't tiddlywinks, man," he snapped. Some of the Crips Glass put away 
would kill him without blinking. "They're without remorse. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The whole thing, he said, is another sad twist in a life that got off to a bad 
start. Hearing that Glass attributed his mother's death to tuberculosis, the 
uncle heaved a sigh. "She was murdered, man. A man raped her and beat her. Down 
in Watts. Kevin was there. He witnessed it." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, he just hopes Glass can stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
Even law-enforcement officers and district attorneys who are now rooting for 
Glass, who consider him their friend or brother, admit in candid moments that 
they have doubts. The sad pattern, they say, is that kids who grew up on the 
streets usually return to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Birse, though, refuses to entertain thoughts of failure. The big success of 
Operation Blue Rag, he says, is not that it took 70 dangerous Crips off the 
street for a while, but that it gave one young Crip the chance to break away 
from the tragic statistics and get a shot at a different life. 
</P>
<P>
"That's as important to me as arresting people. Kevin shows that people can 
change," Birse says. "I say these things and people look at me, like, What are 
you talking about? But it's the truth." 
</P>
<P>
ON THE EVENING OF AUG. 6,with all but one trial behind him, Glass got the call 
to start packing. The next morning, a federal marshal drove him, his girlfriend 
and their baby to the airport. They disappeared. No phone calls, no 
change-of-address forms, no goodbys permitted. But then, the Blue Rag team had 
been saying goodby for months. 
</P>
<P>
On one sunny afternoon during the preliminary hearings, for instance, Glass, 
Jaus and Birse climbed into the Astrovan and drove to San Diego International 
Airport. Checking their weapons with airport security, the detectives walked 
Glass to the gate. As they waited for the passengers to board, Birse threw an 
arm over Glass' shoulder and offered advice; Jaus brought him a soda. Then 
Birse drove along the shore, past the sailboats and fancy restaurants and down 
to where the murals of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and other black 
oracles of hope battle with gang graffiti for people's attention. 
</P>
<P>
Stopping at 30th and Imperial, Birse called a burned-out former gangster over 
to the van. "How are things?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"See for yourself," the man said. "It's a ghost town." 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks down the road, a boy of 7 or 8 waved Birse over. Birse knew the 
boy's family. He'd watched the child grow up. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Pat," the boy said. "Give me 10 bucks -- I want to see a movie." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have 10 dollars," Birse said. He dug into his pocket and handed the 
boy the six dollars he did have. 
</P>
<P>
The boy grinned. "Thanks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Birse fixed him with a gaze that said "Don't dis me." "By the way," he 
growled, "how come you're wearing all that blue?"

<P>
IT'S LATE AFTERNOON in a brightly lit dressing room in the basement of the Los 
Angeles Music Center, and Maurice Sendak is slumped wearily in a chair, 
overseeing the fittings of chorus costumes for next week's opening of 
"Idomeneo." Suddenly, a young man with dark hair and glasses, the last fitting 
of the day, announces to the half-dozen costume fitters and wardrobe attendants 
that the open-front sailor's jerkin they've put on him is totally unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"There is too much skin showing," he insists. "I want to wear a T-shirt." 
</P>
<P>
For a second, everyone is stunned. A T-shirt? For Mozart? 
</P>
<P>
"Who designed this costume anyway?" he says in a tone suggesting that whoever 
did has clearly lost his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I did," Sendak says. 
</P>
<P>
"Singers don't have the bodies for something like this," the man says. "There 
is too much skin showing. I want to wear a T-shirt." 
</P>
<P>
"No," says Sendak firmly. "That would be entirely out of character." 
</P>
<P>
But the young man is unabashed. "What do I play in this opera anyway?" he 
demands, "Some kind of fairy?" 
</P>
<P>
The room is frozen in a shocked tableau. "That's a very offensive question," 
Sendak says. "It doesn't deserve a reply." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know this opera," the singer continues. "What am I supposed to be 
anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
"You're a sailor." 
</P>
<P>
"What time period?" 
</P>
<P>
"Combination 18th Century and classical. You're just coming back from the siege 
of Troy." 
</P>
<P>
The man seems ready to criticize Mozart's plot as well, but by this time the 
costumers have brought out his cape, which covers his chest and leaves him 
nothing more to complain about. 
</P>
<P>
After the singer leaves, the head fitter hurries over to Sendak: "He's young," 
she soothes. "He doesn't understand how it's will look. He doesn't have your 
vision." 
</P>
<P>
"Something like that always happens," says Sendak bitterly. "Everything is 
going great. You totally let down your guard and then some mosquito comes along 
and ruins everything." 
</P>
<P>
The worst part was that the singer felt no shame for not having read the opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Aggghhh!" he says, stomping off in disgust. It is one more instance of what 
he's long contended -- that agony, defeat and disaster are the normal human 
condition. "The bad things always happen," he says. "The good things -- they're 
the inexplicable." 
</P>
<P>
MAURICE SENDAK at 62 is a short, neatly bearded man who wears comfortable, old 
sneakers, brushed-cotton jeans and walks with a cane. In conversation, he comes 
across as a concerned, low-key curmudgeon, direct and candid, but with a 
perpetual air of anxiety that seems to say, "If I don't worry, who will?" 
</P>
<P>
His preoccupied manner notwithstanding, Sendak is an artist recognized around 
the world, famous in part for the 10 or so opera sets he's designed since 1980, 
but mainly for the 80 children's books he's illustrated during the past 40 
years, including 19 he also wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the yardstick by which all other children's illustrators in the world 
are measured," says Michael di Capua, his longtime editor at Farrar, Straus 
&amp; Giroux. "He is the standard." 
</P>
<P>
"If one hesitates to call (Sendak) the foremost illustrator in contemporary 
America or the most accomplished draftsman, it is only because those terms set 
too narrow a limit on the nature of his achievement," wrote New York Times 
critic John Gross in 1988. "He is an artist, nothing less; an artist with a 
powerful vision." 
</P>
<P>
He is also an artist with a broad repertoire and an ever-evolving style. Sendak 
started his career by imitating every important children's artist since the 
1850s, and made their work his own. Over the years, his style has become 
increasingly mature, complex and surrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his popularity -- at the 1988 Bologna Book Fair he was treated as if he 
were a rock star -- there's little of the self-important celebrity about 
Sendak. Unlike many established artists, he is surprisingly accessible; he has 
no secretary and even though he positively abhors the telephone, he seems 
incapable of not answering it. He lives 70 miles north of New York City on the 
outskirts of Ridgefield, Conn., in a stone house that dates in part from 1790. 
It is filled with original art (including Winslow Homer and William Blake), 
first-edition books by writers such as Herman Melville and Henry James and one 
of the most extensive collections anywhere of Mickey Mousiana (Disney's 
creations were his first love.). 
</P>
<P>
"Please don't write I live in the woods under the mushrooms," Sendak says. 
"That gets so boring." 
</P>
<P>
There is a bit of fondness for the 19th Century about Sendak. As he readily 
admits, he's not an artistic innovator -- "that's not my talent." His 
"household gods" are Melville and Mozart. Sendak refuses to buy a personal 
computer -- he writes on yellow legal pads -- for fear that it might take the 
agony out of writing. "There should be agony," says Sendak, who has taken as 
long as five years to finish a story. "I'm a firm believer in agony." 
</P>
<P>
From someone who writes children's books, such pessimism may seem surprising, 
but, he argues, there is nothing particularly sunny or carefree about 
childhood. Contrary to the popular notion, children are neither innocent nor 
fragile, Sendak believes. Because of their powerlessness, they can't afford to 
be. Childhood is a time of great passion, fear and trauma. And, he says, adults 
don't do children any favors by ignoring their deep emotional life and feeding 
them half-truths and sociologically approved self-help books for dealing with 
"pimples and small breasts." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything relating to them is condescending and faintly contemptuous. I'm not 
an expert on childhood. It is not my profession. It is only my memory and 
instincts (that I rely on). But the best fairy tales, Grimm and the rest, are 
great because they give power to children," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of empowering children is what Sendak's work is all about. In 
his unsentimental fantasies, children experience a wide range of emotions, from 
resentment of a sibling to fear of abandonment -- but transformed through the 
mirror of his art. In a 1981 review of Sendak's somber and even "troubling" 
"Outside Over There," the Economist described him as "an innocent gone 
berserk," "a genius with the magic of madness" and a "masterly" artist with 
"the key to the back of beyond."

Some critics, in fact, wonder whether "Outside Over There" isn't really a book 
for adults, with its somber, brooding, surrealistic atmosphere and (to some) 
nearly incomprehensible story set in a golden, 18th-Century romantic German 
landscape. The heroine, a resolute 9-year-old, loses her much-resented baby 
sister to goblins. She then dons her distracted mother's yellow raincoat to 
save her sister from becoming "a nasty goblin's bride" "outside over there." 
</P>
<P>
The success of "In The Night Kitchen," an earlier work in which a little boy 
named Mickey (after Mickey Mouse) frolics through a night bakery filled, wrote 
one reviewer, with cartoonlike characters of "monumental proportions and 
lunatic energy," has much to do with its perfectly realized dream fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
But Sendak's most famous book by far, is "Where The Wild Things Are," a story 
published in 1963 about a little boy named Max. When Max's mother sends him to 
his room for terrorizing the family dog, Max instead sails off in a fit of 
pique to an island where he releases his aggression by dominating the wild 
things (modeled in part on Sendak's relatives) there and returns home 
reconciled with his mother and in time for supper, too. The book, which has 
sold millions of copies in 14 languages has been called by critics "the most 
suspenseful and satisfying nursery tale of our time." 
</P>
<P>
"What do they call it in German?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Where The Wild Guys Hang Out,' " Sendak says. "A very bad title." 
</P>
<P>
"What about in France?" 
</P>
<P>
" 'Max and the Maxi-Monsters' -- I like that better." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his worldwide acclaim, Sendak is still amazed at his readers' reactions 
to his books. When he goes to colleges to speak (his standard lecture, "Descent 
Into Limbo," is about the chaotic nature of the creative life), droves of 
students, many of whom grew up on his books, come up after his lecture to meet 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"And they literally are speechless," he says. "Sometimes they cry and are very 
embarrassed. They seize your hand. They don't know what to say to you because 
you've been part of their lives in a way that's a primary process that started 
before they had language. In many ways, you had a much more intense and 
personal relationship with them than their parents did." 
</P>
<P>
Some young readers, Sendak says, take his books into the bathtub or sleep with 
them. He once met a young couple who became engaged when they discovered that 
as children they both took "Wild Things" to bed with them. 
</P>
<P>
"So now," Sendak says, "these two wild things are going to bed with each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
IT'S 3 P.M. on a humid August afternoon and Sendak is rolling through New York 
state countryside in his blue Volvo station wagon. Lynn Caponera, his 
cook/housekeeper/chauffeur, is driving. We are headed to Saratoga Springs, 
where a team of artists, working from Sendak's small-scale renderings, is 
painting the sets for "Idomeneo." 
</P>
<P>
When an accident forces the traffic into one lane, a black lug-tired pickup 
swerves right in front of us. "Such bastards!" Sendak exclaims. "Such macho 
bastards!" 
</P>
<P>
There is a smashed big rig over on one side of the road. "God," he gasps -- the 
accident looks fatal. Then we see the driver standing on the berm, chatting 
with the state police. "Good," Sendak says. "Now we can stop worrying about him 
-- the jerk!" 
</P>
<P>
In fact, eternity is rarely far from Sendak's mind. In 1967, at age 39, he 
suffered a heart attack during an interview on British TV. Although he was 
hospitalized for five weeks, he never told his mother, who was dying of cancer, 
as was Jennie, his Sealyham terrier and beloved companion of 14 years. "That 
year was a nightmare," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Although people who survive near-fatal experiences are supposed to come out of 
them with a new attitude toward life, Sendak says his 
take-time-to-stop-and-smell-the-flowers phase lasted all of three minutes 
before his customary free-floating anxiety reasserted itself. "It is a great 
relief not to die," he admits. But there were no life-altering insights or 
permanent change. "I never learned how to play or have a good time or take 
vacations or treasure life or do all the things you think you would learn from 
such an experience." 
</P>
<P>
Sendak comes by his pessimism quite naturally. His parents were Polish-born 
Jews from two small shtetls outside Warsaw, and they immigrated to Brooklyn 
just before World War I. "When my father came home with something good to tell 
my mother, she would put her finger to her mouth: 'Don't say it out loud. Who 
knows if HE is listening?' " The idea was if you say something good out loud, 
Jehovah might think you were bragging. Then, Sendak says, you'd really get 
nailed. 
</P>
<P>
There was good reason to be wary. The year after Sendak was born, his father, a 
dressmaker, lost most of the family fortune in the stock market crash. Sendak, 
always a sickly child, nearly died from the measles and double pneumonia at age 
2 and from scarlet fever at 4. He spent his Brooklyn childhood indoors. He 
wasn't good at games. He had no friends. The neighborhood kids, he says, 
considered him a sissy. His companions were his older brother Jack, with whom 
he started writing stories when he was 9, and his beloved older sister, Natalie 
(the prototype for the brave and resourceful Ida in "Outside Over There"). 
</P>
<P>
School was a nightmare for Sendak. He was appalled by the regimentation and the 
competition and shocked, he says, "by how rough and cruel the teachers were, 
how inattentive they were to my feelings." 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Sendak got a job embellishing Mutt &amp; Jeff newspaper strips 
for comic books. The thought of college filled him with dread, so he went to 
work instead. Within a few years, he landed a job as a window dresser for the 
New York toy store F.A.O. Schwarz. The book buyer there, after seeing some of 
his drawings, introduced him to Ursula Nordstrom of Harper &amp; Row, who 
arranged for him to illustrate "The Wonderful Farm" by Marcel Ayme. That was in 
1951. He's been writing and illustrating children's books ever since. 
</P>
<P>
LATE IN THEafternoon, we arrive at the Adelphi Hotel, a Victorian hotel with 
wonderful old paintings, framed mirrors, Persian rugs and wicker chairs -- the 
kind of place where one would not be surprised to see Mark Twain step out from 
behind a potted palm, in a linen suit, smoking a cigar. The place seems to 
bring out Sendak's literary nostalgia; he spends most of dinner talking about 
Herman Melville, a writer to whom he turns during sleepless nights when he 
feels especially lonely and low. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent the last year reading about him, obsessively, implacably, 
relentlessly. He was a genius, maybe the greatest we ever had. He is a great 
support system to all artists. I mean, just the banal facts of his life are so 
mortifying -- his career, the difficulties of being that original and that wild 
and living in America in the 19th Century. He was at the height of his powers 
when he wrote 'Moby Dick,' and (it) was a huge and colossal flop. At the age of 
32 or 33, his career was over. And he lived till 72, taking money from his 
family and being regarded with contempt by his in-laws. He could have written a 
hack book but he wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very strange man. He wrote very strange books. And there are aspects 
of his life that are totally unknown -- his relationship with (Nathaniel) 
Hawthorne, which has to be one of the most interesting relationships between 
two giant writers in America. The letters he wrote to Hawthorne were clearly 
love letters. But we just don't know. You can't prove what you think you are 
reading between the lines. Even now there are no really good up-to-date 
contemporary biographies that really cope with the very complicated issues of 
(Melville's)life. People seem to steer away from him for some reason, as if he 
is still too hot to handle." 
</P>
<P>
"You should write a book," I tell Sendak. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I will." 
</P>
<P>
"It would make a great movie," Caponera says. "But who would play Melville?" 
</P>
<P>
"William Hurt," Sendak says. "He always plays characters who look like they are 
about to vomit." 
</P>
<P>
THE NEXT MORNING,Sendak goes to see the canvas drops for "Idomeneo," which are 
being painted in a sprawling, turn-of-the-century abandoned factory on a bluff 
overlooking the Hudson River. Sendak began sketching and painting the 
renderings for these drops two years ago, although the painters didn't start on 
the canvases till this past spring. While Sendak stands on a tall aluminum 
ladder, the painters uncover one by one the 20x70-foot canvas drops on the 
floor (ultimately there will be 38 of them). 
</P>
<P>
Though outwardly calm, Sendak is more than a little anxious, especially when 
it's time to view one complicated series of seven drops representing a pastel 
ocean and sky from deep in a rocky cave. "Oh, oh, oh," he says, when they pull 
out a scene of a gowned goddess floating over a cringing sea dragon. "Tales of 
Jung." 
</P>
<P>
When they display the final climactic scene, even Sendak is surprised. "God," 
he tells his chief painter, a cheerful bearded German named Michael Hagen, "I'm 
the first to be amazed. Even the stars are in the right place. Gorgeous. OK, 
thank you. They look wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Sendak has always wanted to do the sets for "Idomeneo," he later tells me. 
"I've just been waiting to be asked." 
</P>
<P>
A fanatical opera buff, Sendak was flabbergasted when director Frank Corsaro 
first asked him to design the sets and costumes for a 1980 Houston Grand Opera 
production of "The Magic Flute." Reviewers found his set designs "sumptuous," 
with intriguing undertones of foreboding. 
</P>
<P>
Designing opera sets, he says, provides a rare, keen thrill. "There is 
something very beautiful about so temporary, fragile, elusive an art form. It 
is the fragility of it that makes it so appealing. It sort of speeds up the 
whole life cycle." 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the set factory, Sendak sits down to autograph gift posters he 
designed. People seem to love them, but they are a little bewildered by the 
prominently featured sea dragon floating through the clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"I say the purpose of posters is to sell tickets and lie. If you get them in, 
you get them. The worst that can happen is that they fall asleep." 
</P>
<P>
Heading back to Ridgefield that afternoon, Sendak is exhausted, both from the 
psychological strain of having to approve the drops (he was afraid that if he 
had to reject one it would have crushed the crew of young painters) and also 
from the fact that the hotel desk clerk woke him that morning at 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
"I was furious," Sendak says. "I couldn't get back to sleep. I said, 'Why are 
you doing this to me?' " 
</P>
<P>
LIFELONG INSOMNIAC, Sendak spends his nights fretting about everything: his 
huge, 7-year-old German shepherd, Runge; his own erratic health, and what he 
seems to regard as his fleeting and ephemeral success. 
</P>
<P>
"He can't figure out how he came this far," says Jeff Diamond, who acts as 
liaison between Sendak and the Los Angeles Opera Company, "or how he ever got 
rich illustrating children's books." 
</P>
<P>
That is also a mystery to his detractors, some of whom object to his 
surrealistic settings and what they see as his illogical plots. Sometimes their 
criticism becomes quite particular. Some people saw no reason for his drawing 
Mickey's penis in "In the Night Kitchen," others don't appreciate his penchant 
for including dogs, Mozart, and fat, ugly babies (Sendak often draws himself). 
</P>
<P>
"The worst review I ever had," he says, "was a full page in the New York Times 
on 'Dear Mili.' The reviewer hated it and launched an attack against my 
perverse obscurity, strange and meaningless allusions and tiresome references 
to Mozart and dogs. Basically (the reviewer wrote), 'Why didn't I stuff the 
whole thing?' That reviewer was Salman Rushdie." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by what he considered priggish reactions to his stories (in later 
years, some librarians would draw diapers on Mickey in "In the Night Kitchen"), 
in 1965, Sendak resorted to deliberate sexual symbolism in "Hector Protector." 
He drew a picture of a little boy standing on the back of a lion and holding a 
fat snake in the queen's face. Because it was based on a nonsensical Mother 
Goose story, he says, adults overlooked the sexual connotation. "But the 
children read it instantly -- symbolism is the language of children -- and I 
got a bunch of letters from little boys wanting to know if their penises would 
get big like that." 
</P>
<P>
Years later, Sendak says, he told that story at a meeting of librarians. They 
were uniformly appalled. "But it was charming and innocent. Because it was 
about dicks, and dicks are charming and innocent." 
</P>
<P>
Although criticism deeply wounds Sendak, he's fully capable of giving as good 
as he gets. In casual conversation, he will announce that Jackie Kennedy has 
"vulgar" hair, that Paul Newman's salad dressing is as "awful" as the actor is, 
that Mary Martin "castrated" Peter Pan and that Andrew Lloyd Weber's "Phantom 
of the Opera" is "puerile, simple-minded, banal, trivial and soporific. I wish 
I could say something good about it. I liked the chandelier falling down." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he says, people tell him, "Lighten up, Maurice. Does everything have 
to be so serious? Can't you just go and have fun?" 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, he does go into New York to see a show, but he rarely has a good 
time. "I would much rather see a Marx Brothers or Buster Keaton or even a 
pornographic movie." He does like to watch movies on the VCR while he works. "I 
can draw and have videos (at the same time). Drawing is almost congenital." 
</P>
<P>
Which does not mean, Sendak says, that drawing is the most important thing. 
"When you teach, you find students who technically can draw circles around 
you." But often "they don't have anything to say. There is nothing in the work 
that has any heart. When I was young, I tormented myself by envying everyone 
who drew better. First it was the hands, then the feet, then the ears. And to 
this day I have not improved. That is the way I draw hands, ears and feet. And 
now I have people who analyze the meaningfulness of the big feet in my 
drawings. Great." 
</P>
<P>
Academicians long have been intrigued by the Freudian, Jungian and Reichian 
implications of his work. "I don't understand the cross-references or the 
psychobabble," he says. "I skip those parts and get to the good parts about me 
-- why (my characters) are naked, why their feet are big, why their ears are 
odd." 
</P>
<P>
Although scholars attribute Ida's big feet in "Outside Over There" to 
everything from her alleged fear that "spiritually she is flying" to the 
realization that "emotionally she has no gravity," the truth, he says, is 
simply that he doesn't know how to draw small feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe all your models (just) have big feet," says Caponera, a neighbor whose 
feet were drawn by Sendak when she was a teen-ager for "Outside Over There." 
</P>
<P>
"I got carried away," he says. 
</P>
<P>
T HIS AGE,with such a large collection of work behind him, no one would 
begrudge Sendak a thing if he slowed down. But he remains a self-proclaimed 
workaholic, because, he says, it keeps his mind "off the human condition." His 
future projects include: two Ravel operas in New York in November and a revival 
of "Where the Wild Things Are" at Christmas in Chicago. He's working on 
costumes and sets for yet another Mozart opera, "La clemenza di Tito," as well 
as revising a screenplay that he wrote with director Carroll Ballard. Sendak is 
illustrating a new book, and he has recently founded a children's theater to 
produce stories of real fire and passion, like the unbowdlerized Peter Pan. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll be your own producer?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," laughs Sendak. "I'll be able to hire and fire all those people who had 
their heels on my neck all those years." 
</P>
<P>
Sendak and I have been talking about art and politics, death, eternity and the 
often-denied passions of children. And as we roll back into Ridgefield, it 
suddenly occurs to him that "in a way, we basically have been talking about the 
same thing this whole trip -- Melville and why (his relationship with 
Hawthorne) hasn't been dealt with and children and why (their emotions) haven't 
been dealt with. Why is this so difficult to discuss?" he asks. "If you believe 
anything Freud says, children have a deeper sexual life and intense sexual 
love. If a child has a crush on somebody, we call it puppy love. We have to 
denigrate it. 'How real can it be?' 
</P>
<P>
"In my small way, I'm fighting the creeping death that has occurred in 
children's literature -- it has become a business and a profession. There are 
formulas and the formulas abound and most of the books are quite terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Sendak has much hope that this is likely to change. In the cultural 
Dark Age of contemporary America, money has become the measure of everything. 
"You judge people (not by their merit) but by how much money they have," he 
says. Which is why he finds himself turning more and more to his personal gods, 
Mozart and Melville. "They were pure. They never gave in. They did it their 
way. And it cost them."

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: CHOOSING AMONG ARRAY OF SHAREHOLDER SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national 
consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine.

<TEXT>
<P>
The mutual fund business in recent years has borrowed an act from the auto 
industry. As competition has become more intense and buyers more 
discriminating, fund companies have unveiled additional features -- some of 
which have nothing to do with financial performance. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these innovations fall within the realm of shareholder services. They 
range from automatic purchase plans to the ability to place open orders when 
buying or selling funds. No longer can you be content merely with selecting the 
type of investment vehicle you want, or the one with the most powerful engine. 
You also need to pick and chose among the various add-ons. Here are some of the 
more common shareholder services: 
</P>
<P>
* Automatic-purchase plans. You can choose to buy a mutual fund either in one 
lump sum or in increments. With an automatic-purchase or share accumulation 
plan, you authorize the fund company to take out a set amount on a fixed 
schedule, such as $100 a month, from your checking account. You purchase shares 
in small amounts and at various prices, so you don't have to worry about buying 
in at a market top. 
</P>
<P>
An automatic-purchase plan can be a handy means for novices to start investing. 
"It's a forced savings plan and for most people a relatively painless way to 
go," says Mark C. Winmill, senior vice president at the Bull &amp; Bear Group, 
a New York-based fund company that's adopting such a program. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, you can also select to withdraw money from a fund automatically and 
at regular intervals. This makes sense if, for example, you're retired and want 
to live off of the dividend income that a bond fund generates. 
</P>
<P>
* Dividend-reinvestment plans. But there's a good reason not to tap your 
dividends and capital gains distributions. If left alone, this money can be 
used to buy additional shares, and that can substantially boost the value of 
your account. In fact, over many years, it's likely that reinvested dividends 
and capital gains distributions will come to represent a large proportion of 
your total profit, bigger even than the nominal appreciation of the stocks or 
bonds held by the fund. 
</P>
<P>
* Telephone switching. On the other hand, a lot of people find it too 
difficult, emotionally, to remain invested for the long term, and that's where 
telephone switching comes in. This option allows you to move from one fund to 
another, or back again, with a simple phone call. You may also make exchanges 
in writing. 
</P>
<P>
Market timers love the telephone service since it allows them to switch quickly 
from a stock or bond fund to a money market portfolio. "I have some real 
problems with a buy-and-hold strategy, because it forces you to hang on through 
crashes and bear markets," says Charlie Hooper, publisher of the Mutual Fund 
Strategist newsletter in Burlington, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
While nearly all fund groups now offer at least one money market portfolio, not 
all allow telephone switching. Even so, the service is becoming increasingly 
common, especially among no-load and low-load families. 
</P>
<P>
Some firms allow switching, but with restrictions. For example, Twentieth 
Century Investors of Kansas City, Mo., requires a 30-day wait between 
movements, while several companies limit the number of switches to four round 
trips (four buys and four sells) a year. Still other firms impose modest fees 
of $5 or so per switch. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not as bad as it might seem. Having investors entering and exiting 
too frequently can make it hard for a portfolio manager to run a fund 
effectively, to the detriment of other shareholders. Besides, if you switch too 
often, you will likely find yourself getting whipsawed. On average, Hooper 
flashes about 2.3 round-trip switch signals a year. "If you go beyond four, you 
will have problems," he says. 
</P>
<P>
* Wide investment selection. Some people might not classify this as a 
shareholder service, but it's something you need to consider if you want to do 
all of your investing under one roof. Most medium and large fund families offer 
a diverse mix of stock and bond funds that vary greatly in their potential for 
risk and returns. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, most fund groups will accept your investment dollars in the form 
of a retirement account -- IRAs for individuals, 401(k) plans for companies and 
Keoghs for the self-employed. Dozens of funds that normally require relatively 
large investments of $3,000 to $10,000 or more will lower their minimums for 
people wanting to put money into an IRA. 
</P>
<P>
* Simplified record keeping. Fund companies will periodically mail you 
statements that show how many shares you own, what they're worth and when you 
made purchases and redemptions. The statements list any dividends earned and 
your share of the fund's capital gains or losses -- a handy feature when it 
comes time to fill out your tax return. 
</P>
<P>
* Telephone representatives. Fund companies aren't allowed to offer advice on 
which portfolios you should buy or sell. It's up to you, your broker or other 
financial adviser to make these and related decisions. However, most fund 
companies have telephone representatives available to field questions and to 
mail out prospectuses and other fund literature. Most companies now offer 
toll-free numbers for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
* Swaps for fund shares. A few groups will allow you to buy shares in their 
funds, using stock you own as payment. If you have accumulated stock you don't 
really want -- from an inheritance, for example -- this is a way to swap it for 
a stake in a mutual fund without having to pay a broker commission. 
</P>
<P>
Bull &amp; Bear offers this program, and Winmill admits there's some 
case-by-case subjectivity as to which stocks will be accepted. "The securities 
have to be like those in the fund you want, although they don't have to be 
current holdings," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you own 500 shares of IBM, Bull &amp; Bear will let you apply 
the value of the stock to the purchase of its equity funds. "We wouldn't want 
some illiquid, pink-sheet company," Winmill says, referring to thinly traded 
over-the-counter stocks. He adds that Bull &amp; Bear prefers to accept round 
lots of stock (100-share increments) rather than odd lots. Likewise, Bull &amp; 
Bear will accept certain bonds as payment for shares in its fixed-income funds. 
</P>
<P>
The SFT Group of King of Prussia, Pa., will accept odd lots of stock for an 
equal value of shares in its Odd-Lots Fund. 
</P>
<P>
* Buying on margin. This involves borrowing money from a brokerage to purchase 
additional fund shares, just as you can leverage your stock holdings. With 
margin, you have greater profit potential, along with increased chance of loss. 
You also must pay an interest charge on the amount borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
To make use of margin with mutual funds, you have to go through a brokerage; 
the fund companies themselves don't provide this service. And brokerages vary 
as to the number of funds they will let you margin. Charles Schwab &amp; Co., 
the San Francisco-based discounter, has one of the most expansive programs, 
allowing investors to buy, sell or take margined positions in about 450 
no-load, low-load and full-load funds. 
</P>
<P>
As with cars, expect mutual funds to come out with even more and fancier 
options in the future. Just last month, for example, Benham Capital Management 
of Mountain View, Calif., unveiled an open-order system that lets you decide in 
advance the prices at which you wish to buy or sell the company's funds. 
</P>
<P>
Just call the company, specify your price and wait. When the fund hits that 
price, Benham executes your order. Unfilled orders expire after 90 days, but 
you can renew or change them at any time. Stock investors for years have had 
the ability to place open orders, but Benham's system appears to be a first for 
the mutual fund business. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman James Benham expects to see more such innovations down the road. He 
predicts that fund companies will increasingly try to deliver superior services 
as a way to differentiate themselves from the competition. With about 3,000 
stock, bond and money-market portfolios around and new ones coming out each 
week, that need is greater than ever. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TIMING YOUR TRADES 
</P>
<P>
One key difference between stocks and mutual funds centers on intraday pricing. 
With a stock, you might get any of several prices, depending on the time of day 
you buy or sell. Not so with mutual funds. Nearly all funds calculate their net 
asset values just once daily, at the close of trading at 1 p.m. Pacific time. 
Thus, you can get only one of two prices on any day the market's open. Here's 
how it works:

By JOHN CRUDELE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: During the past two years, I have put almost $500,000 into penny stocks 
through a San Diego brokerage firm. I happened to speak with a broker from a 
different firm, and he told me what some of my shares were worth. Then I talked 
with the San Diego broker who sold me the shares, and he quoted me prices that 
were higher. In fact, the first broker's prices are always higher. Why? -- San 
Diego 
</P>
<P>
A: The first thing you should do is contact the Los Angeles office of the 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers and report what's going on. The next thing 
you should do is make an appointment with a psychiatrist to find out why you 
would invest $500,000 in penny stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Your next call should be to the Securities and Exchange Commission office in 
Los Angeles. The number is (213) 965-3998. You might also get help from 
California securities regulators. And you might want to hire a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
I spoke with Joseph Goldstein, who heads the SEC's penny stock unit in 
Washington, and he says it is not unusual for stock quotes from different 
brokers to vary in thinly traded securities. "But quotes should be fairly 
close," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein thinks that you should alert authorities to see if any law is being 
broken, and also so they can determine whether the practice you mention is 
widespread. 
</P>
<P>
Not all penny stocks, of course, are worthless. But a lot of them are. 
</P>
<P>
Q: A broker suggested that I invest $25,000 in Nestle, the Swiss company, 
because of its high earnings ratio and because it is one of the largest food 
distributors in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
With more and more countries getting freedom from communism, it is hoped that 
their income will increase demands for products from which they had been 
deprived. What's the opinion of Wall Street about this stock? -- Lakewood, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
A: That's an interesting thought: The Berlin Wall came down so that all the 
deprived people in Eastern Europe could run out and buy chocolate candy. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Morrow, the Smith Barney &amp; Co. food and beverage analyst, calls 
Nestle S. A. of Vevey, Switzerland, a "very well run, high-quality company." 
</P>
<P>
He's been recommending purchase of the stock, even though he sees some 
problems. Forget about Eastern Europe. Think about America, says Morrow, 
because Nestle gets 40% of its income here. 
</P>
<P>
With the U.S. economy slowing, the big question is: Will strapped Americans cut 
back on their consumption of Nestle food products? Nestle's earnings could also 
be hurt by the weak dollar. The numbers could look worse than they really are 
when the company's sales in dollars are translated back into Swiss francs. 
</P>
<P>
But Nestle's stock has already retreated some, so maybe investors are taking 
the company's potential problems into account. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Morrow is one of the few analysts in the United States who follows 
Nestle. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several years ago, I inherited 16,666 shares of Overthrust Resources Ltd. 
stock. The company was supposed to merge with Polaris Resources. I have been 
trying to locate Overthrust to see if the stock has any value. If it is 
worthless, I would like to take a tax loss. Letters that I've written to the 
company are returned, stamped "undeliverable." Can you help me find out if this 
stock has any value? -- Denver 
</P>
<P>
A: Overthrust Resources seems to still exist legally, but the company is 
inactive. Robert Fisher of R. M. Smythe &amp; Co., a New York company, says 
Overthrust last traded on Aug. 22, 1989, at 1 cent a share. There don't appear 
to be any bids for the stock at this time, and shares are being offered at 2 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
The company is still listed in the Denver phone book, but its number, (303) 
298-0430, isn't manned. A recording at that phone number refers you to (303) 
592-7077, which is the office of Polaris Resources. 
</P>
<P>
The woman who picked up the phone at Polaris, but who didn't give her name, 
said Polaris doesn't own Overthrust. "Overthrust just works out of the same 
office," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman confirmed that Overthrust's stock isn't trading and that it isn't 
worth "much more" than 2 cents a share. She also says Overthrust doesn't plan 
any expansion and won't file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
You'll have to consult a tax adviser on what to do about the stock in an 
ongoing company that you are unable to sell. Even if you can claim a loss, the 
stock's price at the time you came into possession of it might have been so low 
as to make such a move unprofitable. JOHN CRUDELE

Through my own work-related contact with the in- and out-patient staff at 
Impact, I've come to respect their dedication to recovery and the quality of 
the program this dedication produces. It is good to see Impact receive the 
recognition it deserves.

"Coming Clean" was the most profound no-nonsense description of curing the drug

Hernandez is to be commended for the time and effort spent at Impact House, one 
of the three largest on the West Coast. As a past president and presently a 
member of the board of directors, I and my vast number of friends are thrilled 
at the true picture portrayed about a dedicated staff at Impact House.

you have more articles focusing on people who have the courage, strength and 
dignity not to become substance abusers, despite the fact that life is not 
always fair and easy?

RETURN TO MORAZAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Return to Morazan," by Patrick McDonnell, is an accurate chronicle of what 
has happened to the thousands of displaced Salvadorans in the civil war. What 
is omitted, however, is whose interests the fighting serves. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador is an oligarchy in which 90% of the land is owned by 2% of the 
population. It is an agrarian economy, and the major export crop is coffee. If 
free enterprise were allowed in which average Salvadorans could become 
entrepreneurs growing their own coffee on their own land, the ruling oligarchy 
would be forced to give up its near-feudal privileges. It is to maintain these 
privileges that the war is being waged. 
</P>
<P>
Here in North America we can help to bring democracy, peace, justice and free 
enterprise to that battered country by refusing to support the coffee oligarchs 
by not purchasing coffee from El Salvador. Sixty percent of El Salvador's 
coffee is exported to the United States and can be found in Folgers, MJB, 
Sanborn &amp; Chase, Nescafe and Maxwell House. Boycotting Salvadoran coffee is 
the right thing for Americans to do. 
</P>
<P>
Our nation was conceived in liberty, therefore, we have an obligation to not 
support despotism. If El Salvador's feudal oligarchy cannot afford its 
privileges because of market pressure from the United States, it will be forced 
to reform.

<TEXT>
<P>
Recently we attended a concert at the Universal Amphitheater and we were 
surrounded by talkers and smokers. 
</P>
<P>
Why these people pay good money to talk through a concert is beyond me. But 
could they please do it somewhere else? Some of us actually buy concert tickets 
to hear the concert. 
</P>
<P>
We asked the smoker to put out his cigarette since it was a nonsmoking 
auditorium, and he wanted to fight over it. I had to get an usher, who escorted 
him outside to finish smoking. When he returned he had the nerve to ask for our 
binoculars. Did I miss something here?

Recently, we were shopping at a Trader Joe's. The people in the car parked next 
to us forcefully opened their door, hitting our car. 
</P>
<P>
When we got out to inspect it, the driver started screaming obscenities at us, 
ordering us to "Never park in a shopping mall again," and demanding to know 
"What's your insurance company!?" 
</P>
<P>
I did not favor a reply, but simply wrote down his license number in case he 
resorted to physical violence against my audacity of parking my car in the way 
of his door. 
</P>
<P>
When I reported this, the police would not take the report because no "crime" 
had been committed. I know it's a rhetorical question, but isn't the purpose of 
law to uphold the quality of life (as defined by the lawmakers)? If so, where 
are the laws that protect us rational and considerate citizens from such 
"quality of life" criminals?

I couldn't agree more with the comment made by Kaufman's sister: "Dating is 
where the shameless really shine." As a 27-year-old woman who has been dating 
for several years, I have encountered som very ill-mannered individuals. 
</P>
<P>
On one unfortunate date, the man with whom I was having dinner proceeded to 
tell me that at that particular moment, he could call nine or 10 women and they 
would go out with them just like that, and he snapped his fingers. I didn't 
know whether I should say something like "That's great. Maybe you should start 
a baseball team" or call a taxi. Being the polite person I am, I didn't say a 
thing and sat through dinner listening to how rich, successful, handsome, tall 
and educated this guy was. He forgot to mention he was also an egomaniac. 
</P>
<P>
What ever happened to the old-fashioned notion of just being nice and honest. I 
guess the trend now is to be rude. Oh well, I have never been able to keep up 
with the trends.

"I BRING THE COOKBOOK page to life by re-creating the look and taste of recipes 
as their authors intended," says professional chef Ruth Hedges. Hedges, well 
aware of the great number of us who read cookbooks like novels -- for pure 
pleasure, with absolutely no intention of actually preparing a recipe -- has 
created Cookbook Fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
"This service is unique, because unlike when dealing with caterers, you can 
control the entire menu," Hedges says. "You get to serve a fantasy meal to 
friends without any effort." So the next time you're planning a party -- 
whether an intimate gathering or a large affair -- -- why not plan on pasta by 
Wolfgang Puck, or blackened snapper by Paul Prudhomme, and a Martha Stewart 
tart for dessert.

The fall season doesn't just mean flashy new programs and splashy specials all 
vying for viewers' attention. The networks have countless changes up their 
sleeves for returning series, in order to bring back old viewers and, perhaps, 
capture some new ones. 
</P>
<P>
Here are changes for some of the networks' returning series: 
</P>
<P>
ABC 
</P>
<P>
"America's Funniest Home Videos" -- The surprise hit of 1990 will offer three 
grand prizes of $100,000 each for the best video entries. 
</P>
<P>
"China Beach" -- The Emmy Award-winning Vietnam War drama moves to a new time 
in its fourth season, to Saturdays at 9 p.m. Also, the series will shift back 
and forth in time, with the opener taking place in 1985. A major character will 
lose a leg. Marg Helgenberger, who plays the cynical prostitute K.C., is 
pregnant in real life and her pregnancy will be written into the show.

There were flakes, and then there was our older brother Thomas, the hipster, 
who walked around the house spouting Ginsberg, Kerouac and Whitman morning, 
noon and night. Wanted everyone to call him Tomas. 
</P>
<P>
It was embarrassing. He had one foot out the door, anyway, so when the Mort 
Sahl Incident happened, we weren't surprised in the slightest. We were upstairs 
in our room, playing "Love Potion No. 9" over and over again, minding our own 
business, and pretty much hoping Dad wouldn't call us downstairs to watch Bob 
Hope's latest Christmas show from Vietnam with the rest of the family. We went 
downstairs for a snack, and Tom walked into the living room, dressed all in 
black. Boy, there was something in the air that night. I heard my Dad say 
something like "Bob Hope is the greatest." Tom snickered and said, "He ain't no 
Mort Sahl, that's for sure." Then Dad said as long as he was putting the food 
on the table he wasn't going to have a Communist living under his roof. And 
that was it. Tom hit the road that night, driving out to the West Coast. So 
when we hear the name Mort Sahl, we think of Tom, and Dad, who laugh about that 
night now. Mort Sahl will perform at Pepperdine University's Smothers Theatre, 
24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, at 8 p.m. Saturday. Tickets are $22. For 
information call (213) 456-4522. R.D.

IT'S BIGGER, MORE BEAUTIFUL -- CLINIC IN VENICE TO CELEBRATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It now has triple the space, a full lab and pharmacy, a meeting room and a 
mauve-and-blue paint job. And the expansion of the Venice Family Clinic, its 
staffers hope, means it can serve more patients more comfortably, more 
efficiently and with more dignity. 
</P>
<P>
The revamping of the nonprofit clinic at 604 Rose Ave. is to be celebrated at 3 
p.m. today. Those expected to attend include actor Richard Chamberlain, U.S. 
Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los 
Angeles), Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) and Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
The $3-million overhaul, started in 1988, includes a new, split-level building 
for patient care, which opened this spring, and a remodeling of the old, 
cramped quarters for offices, which was finished last week. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the clinic boasts an airy and sleek 17,000 square feet. The working poor, 
the homeless and the uninsured can be treated in 18 exam rooms, compared to 
only eight before. Also, the clinic can do its own blood tests instead of 
sending the samples to hospitals and waiting several days for the results, an 
improvement that can make a big difference in trying to treat patients who are 
transients, clinic staffers say. 
</P>
<P>
Prenatal nutrition classes started last month in the spacious community meeting 
room. In the future, the room is to be used for Lamaze courses and support 
group sessions for diabetics. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members say the clinic is more organized and more attractive. "There's a 
flow to it -- the things are in the same place in an exam room, so a doctor 
will not have to find things in some kind of cranny," executive director Fern 
Seizer said. 
</P>
<P>
It is inviting to patients as well, Seizer said, noting the greenery, the 
skylights and the children's play area that are part of the clinic's new look. 
"It respects the dignity of everybody to have a nice place." 
</P>
<P>
Two doctors established the clinic 20 years ago, figuring it would be merely "a 
stopgap measure" to serve people with no other access to health care, Seizer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That population has mushroomed. In 1985, the clinic handled nearly 12,000 
patient visits. Last year, patient visits totaled 30,000, and 6,000 people were 
turned away "because we just couldn't squeeze another body in," Seizer said. 
</P>
<P>
With the larger facilities, the clinic will be able to fit in 45,000 patient 
visits a year, but still expects to have to turn away thousands of people. 
Given the cutbacks in government medical and mental health programs and the 
worsening economy, "the need for the clinic has never been greater," said 
Michael Goldberg, president of the clinic's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic provides eye, gynecological, pediatric, dermatological and 
orthopedic care and is "like a family doctor for the community," Seizer said. 
It operates with a staff of about 60 and a stable of 1,300 volunteers, who 
include medical students, stockbrokers, nurse practitioners and actors. The 
volunteers have a range of duties, such as taking patient histories, testing 
blood pressure, performing other basic health exams and fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 doctors donate their time, either at the clinic or seeing patients 
referred by it in their own offices. Santa Monica, St. John's, Daniel Freeman 
Memorial and other hospitals offer free services for clinic patients, and UCLA 
Medical School provides it with malpractice coverage, Seizer said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the clinic's patients live on the Westside and hold jobs, Seizer said. 
But most earn incomes below the federal poverty level -- $12,500 a year for a 
family of four -- and have no insurance. About 35 homeless people are examined 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
Of the clinic's $3-million annual budget, about $90,000 comes from patient 
contributions -- an average of $3 from patients per visit. About 80% of the 
funding is from individual and corporate donors, with the rest from government 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion and renovation, Seizer said, was a community effort. The 
architectural and interior designing and the new landscaping were donated. The 
largest check, $400,000, came from the Foundations of the Milken Families, led 
by Lowell Milken, brother of former junk bond financier Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
At today's ceremonies, the medical facility will be named after the Milken 
foundations. The administration wing will be named after longtime supporters 
Irma and Lou Colen of Cheviot Hills. Irma Colen conceived of the Venice Art 
Walk, the clinic's annual gala fund-raiser, and Lou Colen, who is in the real 
estate business, helped oversee the clinic expansion.

MANY HELP TEND TO GETTY GARDENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were glad to see Patricia Ward Biederman's article on the Getty gardens. 
(Times, Aug. 30) 
</P>
<P>
From your headlines, readers may get the mistaken impression that Michael 
DeHart, our excellent horticulturist, does everything. 
</P>
<P>
In fact the gardens have been supervised since they were built in 1974 by 
Richard Naranjo (mentioned mistakenly as having been born in Mexico). Mr. 
Naranjo oversees a staff of 12, including Michael DeHart, whom he hired 
recently. It is to Richard Naranjo and his remarkable staff that our visitors 
should be grateful. 
</P>
<P>
Michael DeHart asks that we point out to you that we use a relatively safe 
pesticide, Tempo, against the white fly, which is commercially available for 
institutional use only. We've been inundated with calls from people who think 
we made a special discovery!

GALANTER CRITICISM CALLED 'CHEAP SHOT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Letter-writer Steve Schlein recently complained (Times, Sept. 2) about the city 
of Los Angeles' bungled handling of permit applications for a project in his 
(and my) Venice beachfront neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, he was right in his criticism of the way the city Planning 
Department and Department of Transportation processed the application too 
slowly, leading to the unconditional approval of a controversial proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But he reveals his true motive for writing with his parting shot at 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter ("(She) has not shown any interest in finding out 
exactly why this happened"). This is a flat-out dishonest remark, particularly 
when considered in the context of your previous coverage of the story, which 
notes her concern with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
I also know he's wrong because I'm her staff person assigned to work on the 
case in question. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Galanter has been very active in trying to get to the bottom of 
this annoying and perplexing case. At her direction, I've been exploring why 
and how it happened, how it can be prevented in the future, and how best to 
handle this case as it goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of our office have spoken with the city attorney, several top 
executives in the Planning Department, no less than four zoning administrators 
and several other Planning Department staffers, a lawyer from the state 
attorney general's office, Coastal Commission staff members, numerous community 
residents, and the developer's attorney, who precipitated the crisis by 
invoking the state law in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Galanter has formally requested a response to a number of crucial 
issues the case raises. She is obviously interested in doing a lot more than 
just finding out why it happened, contrary to Schlein's disinformative cheap 
shot.

AN ACTOR'S OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sept. 2 Outtakes column asks, "How far will publicists go to exploit the 
current Mideast crisis?" and then notes that as a cast member of the movie 
"Navy SEALS" I was asked for my opinions. 
</P>
<P>
The author of the Outtakes item either purposefully omitted certain information 
or did not adequately research my past. 
</P>
<P>
If he had, he might have discovered that my grandfather was secretary of the 
Council of Ministers in Iraq and later became the minister of justice and 
education; further, that my father was an Iraqi diplomat for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
My mother, like myself, is American. We lived in Baghdad in the early '60s and 
were present during the overthrow and subsequent assassination of Abdul Kareem 
Kasem. 
</P>
<P>
A friend felt this gave me a unique perspective of the current crisis and, sans 
renumeration, made public my opinions about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than exploitation, it was an honest effort to counteract the 
vilification of Arabs in the American media. My portrayal of the terrorist in 
"Navy SEALS" notwithstanding, I believe my background warrants an opinion.

TWO SIDES OF THE GETO-GEFFEN FLAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Aug. 26 Pop Eye column, Monica Lynch of Tommy Boy Records and Bill 
Adler, rap activist and marketing agent, charged that Geffen Records exercised 
racism by refusing to release an album by the controversial rap group the Geto 
Boys even though the company had released albums by offensive comedian Andrew 
Dice Clay and foul-mouthed rockers Guns N' Roses. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Geffen Records fail to realize that groups such as the Geto Boys 
rely exclusively on raunchy lyrics glamorizing violence, racism and misogyny. 
</P>
<P>
Their music and lyrics have little purpose other than to shock and create 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Acts such as Clay and Guns N' Roses use controversial topics and foul language 
to add to their material and enhance the overall product. Guns N' Roses' 
oft-criticized song "One in a Million" uses seemingly racist and homophobic 
comments to portray the confusion and fear of living on the streets of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Clay's offensive material complements his persona and entire act, which is not 
composed of only vulgar material. 
</P>
<P>
People are often too quick to cry "Racism!" when presented with two seemingly 
similar cases in which different ethnic groups are represented. This time they 
should look beyond the surface and see that this is not a case of white versus 
black, but rather art versus trash.

John Wayne Airport is the fifth-busiest airport in the United States, with 
1,200 to 2,000 daily takeoffs and landings. This illustration shows how many 
planes one controller handled on its main runway during a recent weekday 
afternoon. In a bit more than 20 minutes, 24 planes and two helicopters were 
directed in and out of the airport. Traffic during this period was described as 
moderate. Pilots contacting the tower still refer to it as Orange County, 
although the name of the airport was officially changed to John Wayne Airport 
in 1979.

While American Airlines 1529 is on final approach over the San Diego Freeway, 
Cessna 47K is 5 miles inbound from the northeast. The pilot radios: "Orange 
County tower, this is Cessna Four-Seen-Kilo requesting clearance to land on 
runway one-niner-right." The controller responds: "Cessna Four-Seven-Kilo 
cleared to land on runway one-niner-right. Watch for departing traffic, a Piper 
Malibu." The pilot responds, "Roger, cleared to land on runway one-niner-right. 
Have traffic in sight. Four-seven-kilo." On the ground, American Airlines 214 
and America West 65 await clearance for takeoff. American 214 is delayed, an 
the tower instructs America West 65 to taxi ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
After America West 65 takes off, the tower contacts American 214: "American 
214, taxi across runway one-niner-left. Hold short at runway one-niner-right." 
Te pilot responds and taxis the plane across the nearest runway. He stops 
before crossing runway 19R, the main runway, and awaits clearance for takeoff. 
Cessna 603G and Cherokee 4MA contact ground control for permission to head 
toward the taxi strip. Cessna 603G is directed to a strip on the opposite side 
of the field. Cherokee 4MA is sent to an intersection farther down the runway, 
away from the freeway. Both planes are cleared for takeoff ahead of American 
214. 
</P>
<P>
American 214 moves into position on Runway 19R. The tower radios: "American 
214, cleared for takeoff." The pilot responds: "Roger, American 214 cleared for 
takeoff, have a good day," and starts down the runway. Cessna 52S, taxiing up 
for departure, contacts the tower. The tower responds: "Cessna 52 Sierra, cross 
runway one-niner-left, hold short at runway one-niner-right." The pilot 
responds: "Roger, cross runway one-niner-left. Hold short at runway 
one-niner-right. Five-two Sierra." Delta 1891 is inbound 5 miles north, 
followed by USAir 2494 at 7 miles north. On the taxi strip, Beech Bonanza 5JW 
awaits clearance for takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
After Beech Bonanza 5JW takes off, Delta 1891 lands. Cessna 293 taxis up the 
strip. The tower radios: "Cessna two-niner-three, cross runway one-niner-left. 
Hold short on runway one-niner right." The pilot responds, "Roger, cross 
one-niner-left. Hold short one one-niner-right. Two-niner-three."He taxis the 
plane to runway 19R and waits for clearance to take off. USAir 2494 is on final 
approach ad Beech Baron 01Y is seven miles to the north. USAir 2990 is 10 miles 
southwest. 
</P>
<P>
USAir 2990, cleared for landing, is on final approach. Cessna 364 calls in over 
Tustin. The tower responds: "Cessna three-six-four cleared for landing on 
runway one-niner-right. Watch for jet turbulence from a seven-thirty-seven." 
The pilot responds: "Roger, Orange County Tower, Cessna three-six-four cleared 
to land on one-niner-right. Good day." As Bonanza 07Q lands, Skywest 446 
appears on the controller's radar screen 8 miles to the north. Continental 1764 
and Aerostar 95X wait for clearance to take off. 
</P>
<P>
USAir 2494 lands. Continental 1764 pulls away from the gate and taxis up for 
departure. Cherokee 04F taxis toward the runway on the opposite side of the 
field. Eagle, the Costa Mesa Police helicopter, contacts the tower: "Orange 
County Tower, this is Eagle. We're conducting surveillance over the city two 
miles southwest." The tower radios back: "Roger, Eagle, have you in sight." 
</P>
<P>
USAir 2601 pulls away from the gate and heads towards the taxi strip. Skywest 
446, now 5 miles to the north, contacts the tower. The tower radios. "Skywest 
446, cleared to land on runway one-niner-right." The pilot responds: "Roger, 
Orange County Tower, Skywest four-four-six, cleared to land on 
one-niner-right." Turbo Commander 9WC is 10 miles north. 
</P>
<P>
Beech Bonanza 07Q reports in from 5 miles north. Eagle contacts the tower again 
to inform the controller it is inbound for landing. The tower responds: "Roger, 
Eagle cleared to land at the heliport." Aerostar 95X taxis up for departure. 
The controller radios Cessna 293 waiting on Runway 19R: "Cessna two-niner-three 
clear for takeoff. Watch for helicopter traffic at 12 o'clock." The pilot 
responds: "Roger Orange County Tower, Cessna two-niner-three cleared for 
takeoff on runway one-niner right. Have helicopter in sight." Cherokee 04F 
taxis up the strip, followed by Citabria 09V. Cessna 35Vis inbound from 6 miles 
southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Aerostar 95X takes off. USAir 2601, holding short on runway 19R, is next in 
line for departure. Helicopter 3SH, approaching from the southwest, contacts 
the tower: "Helicopter Three-Sierra-Hotel inbound for landing." The tower 
reponds: "Helicopter Three-Sierra-Hotel cleared for landing at heliport number 
two." Skywest 446 lands while Turbo Commander 9WC is on final approach.

Here are responses to the Aug. 19 question: How do you rate daytime's talk 
shows? 
</P>
<P>
I watch "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee" every day. I occasionally see "The 
Oprah Winfrey Show." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Phil Donahue is caring, warm and well-spoken. He is fair to all parties when 
dealing with serious topics and also very attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Oprah Winfrey does a good job with the interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Rivers doesn't speak well and laughs too often at her own jokes. 
</P>
<P>

We don't like Bryant "Grumble" and can't stand Deborah Norville of NBC's 
"Today." Poor chemistry.

FIRE SWEEPS STANISLAUS FOREST; THREAT TO RURAL TOWNS EASED

A stubborn wildfire sweeping through the Stanislaus National Forest on Saturday 
charred more than 2,500 acres and threatened several communities in the 
Tuolumne Canyon before firefighters managed to curb the stubborn blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported 50% contained by late Saturday but, before the danger had 
passed, 5,000 people in the Mother Lode communities of Mi-Wuk Village, Sugar 
Pine and Sierra Village spent hours preparing to flee the small resort towns if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Hampered by gusting winds, about 3,200 firefighters from 15 federal, state and 
local agencies along with an armada of air tankers and fire-fighting vehicles 
were busily keeping the fire from the Tuolumne River Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"They expect containment by early (Sunday) morning," said Joan Leidenthal, a 
spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. "Right now, it looks pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which investigators believe may have been arson, started Thursday in 
the Riverside campground on the north fork of the Tuolumne River. At one point, 
400 people who live in a subdivision southeast of the Sierra Nevada foothill 
town of Twain Harte were evacuated when flames crept to within 100 yards of 
homes in that rural community. They were allowed to return to their homes 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
No structures were destroyed in the fire, Leidenthal said. Fire officials 
reported three minor injuries that were treted at the fire camps.
