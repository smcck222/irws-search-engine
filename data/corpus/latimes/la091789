After recently watching America's most popular television show, "Roseanne," I 
sincerely believe that the viewing public wants good old family programming. 
What a great half hour! I learned so much to pass on to our younger generation. 
Don't Roseanne and her Neanderthal husband set a shining example of how to act 
drunk in a bar and minutes later arrive home, as if they did not drive even the 
least bit intoxicated? Hey, and that barroom fight. There is nothing like 
punching out a vulnerable drunken man, a good lesson for the impressionable 
youth of our country. Boy, I can still feel the testosterone racing violently 
through my veins at the sound of hand meeting face. Is this how family 
programming should make me feel?

<P>
John Huston's dazzling Prizzi's Honor (ABC Sunday at 8 p.m.) is like "The 
Maltese Falcon" set in Brooklyn and done as an Italian opera; it's a 
resoundingly comic love story with sobering underpinnings. Jack Nicholson is a 
raffish Mafia hit man caught between the sultry Kathleen Turner and the 
aggressive Anjelica Huston. One of Huston's very best. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Deluxe (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is that offbeat, under-appreciated 
1975 comedy-Western starring Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterston as a pair of 
contemporary, small-time rustlers. 
</P>
<P>
Director Fred Schepisi and writer-star Steve Martin's Roxanne (CBS Sunday at 9 
p.m.) updates "Cyrano de Bergerac" with much humor, charm and poignancy; Daryl 
Hannah is a delight in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman (NBC Sunday at 
9 p.m.) is a TV movie repeat that finds Lee Majors and Lindsay Wagner trying to 
foil an assassination attempt at the "Russian/American Unity Games." 
</P>
<P>
Although the 1984 Teachers (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.) suffers from awkward 
shifts between satire and slapstick and the intensely earnest and 
heart-tugging, it does cut to the core of classroom malaise. Directed by Arthur 
Hiller, the film is held together by the all-out performance by Nick Nolte as a 
weary but still conscientious social-studies teacher. 
</P>
<P>
From Here to Eternity (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is Fred Zinnemann's 1953 
classic from the James Jones novel about military life in Honolulu. Burt 
Lancaster stars. 
</P>
<P>
Cannery Row (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is another instance when Nick Nolte 
is better than the film, a loving and gentle adaptation of the John Steinbeck 
novel which plays well but lacks punch. Nolte, however, is a splendid Doc, 
strong yet kindly, lonely but determined to be his own man. 
</P>
<P>
Reckless (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) afforded Aidan Quinn a flashy 1984 
film debut in that year's Brando-Dean role as a surly, inarticulate but 
vulnerable rebel in a bleak Pennsylvania steel town. Quinn and local rich girl 
Daryl Hannah work up a steamy romance but the film is essentially fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Margot Kidder was never better than in Donald Shebib's warm and funny 1981 
Heartaches (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) as a gaudy, man-crazy peroxide 
blonde factory worker. Holding their own, however, are co-stars Annie Potts and 
Robert Carradine. 
</P>
<P>
Don Coscarelli's Phantasm (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a thoroughly scary 
experience that centers on two young brothers menaced by a creepy undertaker. 
</P>
<P>
In the chilling The Entity (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.), Barbara Hershey is 
outstanding as an already struggling single parent caught in a battle between 
psychiatrists and parapsychologists over the true nature of a mysterious evil 
force besieging her. 
</P>
<P>
Dog Day Afternoon (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.), one of director Sidney Lumet's 
best, stars Al Pacino as a bombastic, none-too-bright loser desperate to 
finance a sex-change operation for his lover (Chris Sarandon). 
</P>
<P>
Although little known, Robert M. Young's Alambrista! (Channel 28 Friday at 
11:30 p.m.), a raw, unforgettable account of the plight of a Mexican illegal 
alien, is one of the key American films of the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Prince of the City (Channel 13 Saturday at 8 p.m.), one of Sidney Lumet's 
worst, stars a miscast Treat Williams as an NYPD detective whose decision to 
inform on his corrupt colleagues raises a thicket of moral issues, handled 
heavily. 
</P>
<P>
Mariette Hartley excels as the founder of Mothers Against Drunk Driving in the 
fine 1983 TV movie M.A.D.D.: The Candy Lightner Story (Channel 7 Saturday at 9 
p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Solanas' Tangos: The Exile of Gardel (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.) 
is a sensual, bittersweet 1985 study of a group of Argentine exiles living in 
Paris and rehearsing a show inspired by the haunting music of Carlos Gardel, 
the legendary tango singer.

AS A CHILD, he would dream the same dream over and over, until the dreadful 
image would tease the backs of his eyelids even by day: He and his father are 
walking along a road in the early evening darkness when, out of nowhere, a pair 
of headlights pierces the horizon. The two points of light grow monstrously 
large; the dull whine of an engine becomes a roar. The boy jumps in front of 
the father and, with the pounding cylinders only inches away, grabs the car's 
bumper and heaves the entire machine to the side of the road. The father sighs 
quietly. The boy stands trembling. And, in the distance, two more headlights 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all in the wrists. Timing," explains Anthony P. Brooklier, who at 43 is 
now one of Los Angeles' most successful criminal lawyers and supposedly immune 
from childhood bogymen. But the image he has come to call simply "the dream" 
keeps nudging back at odd hours, perhaps because it has become a leitmotif for 
much of his life. 
</P>
<P>
He is the Godfather's son. He is the boy from suburban Anaheim who grew up the 
son of Dominic Brooklier, onetime powerful boss of La Cosa Nostra in Los 
Angeles. He is the high school football star who played catch in the back yard 
with Aladena (Jimmy the Weasel) Fratianno, a Mafia hit man who has confessed to 
at least five contract murders. Brooklier is the young lawyer who left his job 
as a deputy state attorney general to defend his father against serious 
criminal charges, only -- unlike the boy in the dream who fended off the 
onrushing car -- to watch the aging Mafia don die in prison. 
</P>
<P>
There is probably no one in the Los Angeles legal community who has quite the 
mystique of Tony Brooklier, a tall, perfectly coiffed Italian-American who has 
somehow managed to straddle the gap between a modern, successful criminal 
defense practice and the remnants of an underworld heritage that is centuries 
old. 
</P>
<P>
The mystique has to do with more than the Hugo Boss pinstripe suits, more than 
the front table at Giuseppe that he frequents with Hollywood and reputed 
underworld luminaries, more than the quick, evasive joke that is elicited 
whenever anyone asks him about the family business. ("If I told you, I'd have 
to kill you," he once muttered to an inquiring reporter.) Through it all, there 
is the nagging sense that the consigliere image is cheerfully cultivated, 
artfully crafted -- and, like most successful illusions, rooted somewhere in 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklier, a partner in the small Beverly Hills law firm of Marks &amp; 
Brooklier, has built a respected practice, one that ranges beyond organized 
crime, defending accused white-collar criminals, cocaine barons, corrupt public 
officials, stock swindlers, even former law-enforcement agents. But Brooklier 
-- along with his longtime law partner Donald B. Marks -- is unquestionably the 
man the Los Angeles mob calls first when there's trouble with the law. 
Brooklier has handled at least a part of virtually every case brought to 
federal court by the Los Angeles Strike Force on Organized Crime in the past 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It was Brooklier who, in a 1987 stolen-securities case, won an acquittal for 
Michael Rizzitello, described in numerous court documents and government 
reports as one of the most powerful organized-crime figures in Southern 
California today. It was Brooklier who got Robert (Fat Bobby) Paduano, whom 
state attorney general's reports describe as a Mafia associate, acquitted of 
stock-swindling charges in 1986. And it was Brooklier who helped lead the plea 
negotiations last year that led to unexpectedly lenient sentences for most of 
the Peter J. Milano crime family. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in one of the most important organized-crime cases to go to trial here in 
several years, Brooklier will defend Rizzitello in Orange County Superior Court 
on charges that Rizzitello fired three bullets into the head of Santa Ana 
nightclub owner Bill Carroll, who had allegedly been resisting the mob's 
attempt to muscle in on club revenues. (The trial was scheduled to begin 
tomorrow.) 
</P>
<P>
"This is for not letting us eat," Rizzitello is alleged to have snarled as he 
fired the gun from the back seat of a car one night in 1987 while the driver, 
co-defendant Joey Grosso, allegedly held Carroll down. 
</P>
<P>
The nightclub owner was permanently blinded but survived. For 18 months, he 
refused to say who had shot him and why, but finally, when prosecutors agreed 
to dismiss unrelated fraud charges against him, Carroll identified Rizzitello 
and Grosso as his attackers. Brooklier says he expects to prove that 
law-enforcement officials, desperate to get Rizzitello behind bars, put Carroll 
up to fingering the longtime reputed Mafia figure. He also says he'll suggest 
who did shoot Carroll, and why Carroll was too confused -- or afraid -- to 
identify his real attacker. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few of the city's most hardened criminal investigators still voice 
suspicions about Brooklier's background as the son of a former Mafia boss. Most 
top prosecutors say Brooklier is an energetic, highly principled attorney who 
has shrewdly capitalized on his heritage to cash in on what, with the Justice 
Department's sweeping crackdown on the mob over the past decade, has been a 
lucrative field of law. 
</P>
<P>
"He certainly knows those kind of guys come to him, and he represents them, and 
he makes money off them," says James Henderson, the former federal prosecutor 
who successfully tried Dominic Brooklier in 1980. "Moreover, the reason they 
come to him has something to do with who his father was. He's Dominic 
Brooklier's son. They probably feel he can be trusted more than other lawyers 
they know." But Brooklier, Henderson says, "bends over backward" to allay any 
suspicions that he is the mob's representative at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Aging mob boss Dominic Brooklier was Tony's initiation into the high-stakes 
world of criminal defense law, seeking his son's help to fight the first of two 
massive federal indictments for extortion, racketeering and contract murder 
returned against him and his lieutenants just three years after Tony graduated 
from law school in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The second indictment led to a 1980 trial, during which the young lawyer helped 
cross-examine one of his childhood friends and stood before a U.S. district 
judge in a tearful plea for his father's freedom. It is something that 
Brooklier over the years has refused to publicly discuss. 
</P>
<P>
But gradually, in a series of interviews during the past several months, 
Brooklier for the first time revealed the details of his unusual childhood, 
growing up in Orange County as the son of a seemingly ordinary car dealer who 
authorities say was inducted into the criminal world's most secret society, an 
affectionate father who worried about his sons' grades at school -- and a man 
so powerful and revered that conversation would stop when he walked into a 
room. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it was," Brooklier says. "I saw it when I was 5 years old. 
My father could walk into a place, and for whatever reason, the room would 
stop. It was as if every eye was on him. He just had an incredible charisma in 
a very subtle way. He wasn't loud, he wasn't fast-talking, he was understated. 
But men respected my father." 
</P>
<P>
FOR DOMINIC Bruccoleri, born in 1913 just after his parents arrived from 
Palermo, Sicily, surviving in Detroit's crowded Italian neighborhoods depended 
not on how fast you talked, but how smoothly. He picked up English by the time 
he was 8, along with the anglicized family name, "Brooklier," and became a whiz 
at numbers by analyzing odds and making bets at the horse races. 
</P>
<P>
Dominic made his way the way every other kid on the streets made his way: 
hustling. Setting up pins at the bowling alley. Dipping into the till when the 
opportunity presented itself. Charging guys for not being hassled when they 
tried to park with their girlfriends outside. But all that changed when 
Brooklier, as he always told it, took the rap for some older guys for robbing a 
bakery in Toledo and went off to the Ohio State Penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
He spent the first 48 hours in a cell so small he couldn't even sit, and was 
repeatedly beaten and antagonized by a guard for so long that one day, in a 
rage, he heaved the sentry over the side of the third-tier cellblock. The guard 
survived, but Brooklier got an extra several years. While waiting it out, he 
befriended Fratianno, who was serving 10 to 25 years for attacking and robbing 
a bookmaker behind on his tribute payments. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, both of them ended up in Los Angeles at the beginning of what would 
become the notorious Sunset Wars of the late 1940s and early 1950s, when 
gangster Mickey Cohen, the West Coast's legendary mob chieftain, was struggling 
to hold on to the city's gambling and loan-sharking rackets against a veritable 
siege of Italian upstarts -- among them, Fratianno and Brooklier. 
</P>
<P>
On July 20, 1949, Cohen and a few friends were emerging from a post-midnight 
supper at Sherry's Restaurant when a flash of gunfire erupted from behind a 
nearby billboard. Cohen and three others were hit; one of Cohen's top thugs was 
killed, but the rest survived. 
</P>
<P>
Although the shooting was never officially solved, Fratianno years later in his 
memoir, "The Last Mafioso," said Brooklier had been one of the two gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Brooklier was married -- to the former Frances McBride, a woman 
Tony describes as "an Irish Lucille Ball" -- and had started a family and 
settled down in Monterey Park. "We led a very 'Ozzie and Harriet' life," Tony 
says. "I kid you not." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not entirely. There was the time in the middle of the Sunset Wars when, 
fearing retaliation from Cohen's henchmen, Brooklier packed his wife, 
3-year-old Tony and his baby brother and a bodyguard on a plane to hide in 
Texas until things cooled off. By the time he was 6 or 7, Tony remembers 
sensing that something wasn't quite right about his father, "like maybe 
something bad had happened to him once." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'd overheard something, but I started asking my mother questions," he 
says. "She was evasive, which made me more curious, so I'd just ask more 
questions. And I think, just to lay the cards on the table, my father just told 
me. You know, 'Just shut the kid up; let's tell him the truth.' " He told his 
son about the years he had spent in the penitentiary, about how he had thrown 
the guard over the rail and why, "and that he didn't want that for his 
children," Tony recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Brooklier, Tony says, was always direct with his children. When an 
indignant nun threw Tony out of a fourth-grade Catholic-school class in Los 
Angeles for questioning the doctrine of original sin -- the idea that a baby 
who died without being baptized was irreversibly bound for purgatory -- he was 
alled into the principal's office to face his father and an alternative: Either 
apologize to the nun in front of the class or be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
"I had told the nun that this couldn't be true," he said. "She said it was 
true. I said it wasn't fair. She looked peeved and said something like, 'Life 
is unfair.' So I said, 'Then it's B.S." 
</P>
<P>
Brooklier took his son out of the earshot of the principal and sat down. "What 
are you going to do?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Tony replied. "What do you think?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to you." 
</P>
<P>
"You won't be mad no matter what I do?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I won't be mad," Brooklier said. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Tony decided he had been right to begin with. It was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's B.S., too," his father replied. Tony was enrolled in public 
school near the family's new home in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
One late night just a few months later, the stillness was broken by a knock on 
the door. Tony and his two brothers were in their pajamas watching television, 
and Tony got up to see who was there. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to the door, there's like 15 cops with their guns drawn," he recalls. "I 
say, 'What do you want?' I say, 'Who are you?' They say, 'We're the police. Is 
your father home?' I say, 'You wanna arrest him?' They say, 'Yes.' I say, 'Do 
you have a warrant?' So the cop says, 'What are you, his lawyer?' " 
</P>
<P>
The officers burst into the house and grabbed Brooklier on a complaint alleging 
attempted extortion. "Have you ever seen anybody arrested?" Tony says, shaking 
his head. "It's traumatic to see somebody get arrested, even if you don't know 
them, but especially to see your father like that, at gunpoint. I mean, I'd 
never seen a gun before in my life." 
</P>
<P>
The charges were later dropped, but the bitter memory lingered. At school, 
classmates had seen the elder Brooklier's photograph in the newspaper with the 
word "Mafia" next to it, and Tony heard about it the next day, over and over. 
"I had problems," he admits. "But I trusted my father, and I believed in him so 
much that I made myself be above that. And I stood up for him. The way I saw 
it, it was my privilege that he was my father." 
</P>
<P>
Brooklier took over his own used-car dealership in Maywood, and Tony went to 
work for him after school, washing cars on the lot. FBI agents frequently 
monitored Brooklier's meetings with organized-crime figures at the dealership 
and at nearby restaurants, but what Tony remembers about those days are the 
long talks they'd have, the way they'd pass the time between customers. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Brooklier had left school after the third grade, but they played a 
game in which Tony looked up the most obscure word he could find in the 
dictionary and asked his father to define it. "I think, without fail, he could 
tell you what it was," he says. "He had a lot of time when he was young, you 
know, so he constantly read." 
</P>
<P>
Tony says he never knew whatever else his father might have been involved in at 
the time. Later, much later, Brooklier would talk with his son obliquely about 
"this thing" -- the way in which Mafiosi in the United States, if they talk 
about it at all, refer to their organization, La Cosa Nostra: "this thing of 
ours." Mostly, Tony says, his father led him to believe that "this thing" was 
in his past. 
</P>
<P>
But Fratianno, in his memoirs and in a recent interview, said that Brooklier 
even then was working as a soldier in the struggling Los Angeles crime family 
headed by Nick Licata. The two of them had been "made" as Mafiosi together in a 
ceremony in a small Los Angeles winery, Fratianno said. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklier was becoming more and more powerful within the family by the time 
Tony graduated from Savanna High School in Anaheim in 1964 and got a 
congressional appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy. Brooklier, Tony says, had 
always been "amazed" at the A's he and his brothers earned at school. "You have 
to consider the fact, here's a guy who when I was 15 was delighted that I 
didn't have any felony convictions." 
</P>
<P>
Tony was determined to become a Navy fighter pilot. Brooklier flew back with 
his son to Annapolis for a day of touring, surveying the plight of the 
midshipmen "plebes" at the hands of their upperclassmen. "I feel like I just 
dropped him off at the joint," he remarked to his wife when he got back. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through Tony's first year at the academy, a national report on organized 
crime identifying Brooklier as a high-ranking member of La Cosa Nostra in Los 
Angeles received national publicity. One of the commanders called Tony into his 
office. Tony didn't have to resign, he told him, but he should not expect to 
make a successful career with the Navy, either. "You know, 'You come up for 
advancement, who's going to get passed over?' It was a real shock to me. There 
I was, real proud to be part of the United States Navy, and all of a sudden, 
I'm not a midshipman anymore, I'm the son of a Mafia chieftain -- boom." 
</P>
<P>
Tony quietly resigned from the academy, but by then it didn't seem to matter. 
He had already decided to go into law and enrolled at Loyola University and, 
after that, at UCLA law school. "I wanted to put myself in a position to help 
my father," he explains. "Because I sensed when I was a kid what was going to 
happen. It's a thing all kids live with, you know -- your parents will get 
divorced, they'll get hurt, they'll die. But that wasn't my fear. My thing was, 
see, I was so taken about what my father told me happened to him when he was a 
kid (in prison), I was so emotional about that, that I . . . was never going to 
let it happen again." 
</P>
<P>
That, he figures, is where the dream came from, the one about hurling away the 
cars that were bearing down on his father. And that vision came to life late 
one night in 1974, while he was still with the state attorney general's office. 
Dominic Brooklier and several of his lieutenants had been indicted in a plot to 
extort money from bookmakers, loan sharks and pornographers. 
</P>
<P>
Of 12 men indicted, Brooklier was the only one who had not surrendered by the 
time he knocked on his son's door at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"You heard the news, I guess," Dominic Brooklier said quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's going to represent you?" Tony asked. 
</P>
<P>
His father looked at him and smiled. "You are, of course." 
</P>
<P>
Tony pointed out that he was only a few years out of law school, and hardly 
equipped to take on a racketeering case against a man accused of being 
under-boss of an organized crime family. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing like starting at the top," Brooklier replied. 
</P>
<P>
With that, Tony ordered his father into the car, and the two drove all night 
from Sacramento to Los Angeles. He had to ask someone where the federal 
courthouse was. Surrendering his father to federal marshals, Tony sat down with 
the prosecutor on the case, veteran organized-crime strike-force attorney James 
Twitty. "How many indictments are there?" the young lawyer asked, trying to act 
knowledgeable. 
</P>
<P>
"Why, there's only one indictment, Mr. Brooklier. Your father is charged in 11 
counts of that one indictment." Twitty paused a moment. "Is this your first 
criminal case?" 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, all 12 defendants entered guilty pleas under a rarely used legal 
provision that technically allowed them to continue to maintain their 
innocence. Brooklier was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Virtually the entire 
family was behind bars just after Licata, the family boss, died at the age of 
77. When Brooklier emerged from prison in the mid-1970s, it was to take over as 
Mafia boss for all of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
AS DOMINIC Brooklier was leaving prison as a new Godfather, the FBI was gearing 
up for a long-range sting operation designed to put the Mafia in Los Angeles 
out of business for good. Two undercover agents set up a phony pornography 
business in Van Nuys, then leaked word that it might be a good target for a mob 
shakedown. Frank (the Bomp) Bompensiero, a Mafia capo in San Diego who had been 
informing for the FBI, spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the mob discovered it was a setup, most of the Mafia's top 
lieutenants had been secretly recorded extorting the undercover agents. And on 
the night of Feb. 10, 1977, someone retaliated. Bompensiero's body was found in 
a pool of blood. 
</P>
<P>
When the 20-count federal indictment came down charging Brooklier and four 
reputed lieutenants with masterminding both the pornography shakedown and 
related scams and obstruction of justice in connection with Bompensiero's 
murder, Fratianno, who had become the government's star Mafia witness, 
testified that Brooklier had put out the contract on Bompensiero. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Brooklier asked his son to represent him -- this time with experienced 
defense lawyer Alvin Michaelson. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a very touchy situation," Brooklier explains. "This is my father, and 
if I'm going to represent him effectively, I have to know what happened. And he 
told me, he said, 'I promise you, I swear to you, I had nothing to do with 
this.' He said, 'A couple of the other things, in terms of the conspiracies to 
extort, I may have a problem with that, OK? But I swear to you. . . .' He had 
nothing to do with Bompensiero. And that reassured me. Then, I felt that I 
could do it, with a clean conscience. I couldn't have done it, and I wouldn't 
have done it, if I'd thought he was guilty. But my father never lied to me." 
</P>
<P>
Tony believed that Fratianno was lying about Brooklier's part in the murder to 
cover up his own role; he prepared an exhaustive cross-examination to expose 
Fratianno as an unreliable witness. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the two-month trial in 1980, Tony's law partner, Donald Marks, 
grilled Fratianno for days, exposing a few crucial inconsistencies between his 
testimony at trial and what he had said in his memoirs. Fratianno shrugged them 
off to bad memory. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was learned that Arizona police had discovered hand-scrawled notes in 
exiled mob boss Joseph Bonanno's garbage can in Tucson, Ariz., five days after 
Bompensiero's killing. The notes, written in Italian and English, said: "Call 
Turi (the nickname of his son, Salvatore), PM. Tell Turi -- Thursday night. Con 
Semiautomatica. Scanzalora (corta) 22. Che no fa tanto rumore." Translated, the 
note said, "Tell Turi -- Thursday night, with a semiautomatic, gun (short) 22, 
that doesn't make much noise." 
</P>
<P>
Bompensiero had been killed on a Thursday night, with a .22-caliber weapon 
equipped with a silencer. 
</P>
<P>
Together with doubts about Fratianno's testimony, the note planted enough doubt 
in the jury's mind about who had killed Bompensiero to acquit Brooklier and the 
others on the charges related to the Bompensiero murder. Brooklier was 
convicted on 11 other lesser counts of extortion and racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
Michaelson handled the closing argument in the case, but at Brooklier's 
sentencing two years later, it was Tony who stood at his father's side before 
U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr., calling his father at first simply "my 
client." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Brooklier has been very dedicated to his wife, his children. He always has 
been," Tony said. "I am not going to attempt to fence with the court. There are 
things in the past that he shouldn't be proud of, I'm not proud of, but he has 
always provided for his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I just remind the court that he is 67 years old," Tony went on, breaking into 
tears when he referred to his father's recent heart operation. "There is 
concern among his family about how many years he has left . . . and I can 
assure the court that, whatever sentence he does, he will be missed every day." 
</P>
<P>
Brooklier was sentenced to four years in prison, but he never finished doing 
his time. He died in a Tucson prison medical center on July 18, 1984, 11 months 
into his term, six months before he would have been eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
During the last few months, Tony flew to Tucson every week or so, and the two 
would talk about what their lives had come to, how Tony had become a successful 
lawyer and how Dominic had, as he saw it, outlived himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to him once, 'I hoped that this was over, that the family couldn't take 
any more of this, my mother couldn't take any more of this,' " Tony recalls. 
"And he said, sort of in a philosophic way, 'It's been over for a long time.' 
He said, 'We're dinosaurs.' " 
</P>
<P>
"My father was a product of his times, OK?" Tony says. "When my father was 
growing up, it wasn't very good to be Italian. My father strove for what he 
wanted within his world as he knew it. I have to think that things were 
different then. You know, it's easy to look back and say, 'You should've gone 
to Yale.' But things weren't like that when my father was born." 
</P>
<P>
"This thing," he says, his voice catching, "this thing had outlived its reason 
for being. This was a defensive mechanism to fight the inequity and the 
injustice when Italian people first established themselves in the United 
States. And when it became something that was not noble . . . something that 
was not in favor of justice, in the broadest sense, it had outlived itself. And 
my father understood that. It was over. It is over." 
</P>
<P>
These days in the Brooklier family, the Mafia is regarded a little like an 
amusing old aunt. In the office of his well-tended home in Anaheim, Tony keeps 
an old photo of himself and his two brothers with the inscription, "Wanted for 
Questioning by the FBI. (Call 1-800-DON'T START CAR.)" 
</P>
<P>
BROOKLIER, ORDINARILY one of Los Angeles' priciest lawyers (his retainer alone 
can run into tens of thousands of dollars), is representing Michael Rizzitello 
for what he admits is a nominal fee. Rizzitello was short of cash, he says, 
"and I don't feel I can turn my back on him over money." 
</P>
<P>
For some lawyers and investigators, that raises anew the question that 
Brooklier admits has dogged him throughout his legal career: How much of his 
business grows out of old loyalties to his father and his father's friends? 
</P>
<P>
The question gets at the nagging label of "mob lawyer" that occasionally 
attaches to Brooklier, a tag that carries a host of shady connotations that 
have little to do with Brooklier's practice. Many, schooled in Hollywood, 
associate "mob lawyers" with Robert Duvall's character in "The Godfather," a 
consigliere who is an initiated member of the crime family and who counsels the 
family leadership on its illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
There's a big difference between that and what Brooklier does, which is to 
represent reputed Mafia defendants in court, much as he might any other 
criminal defendant. But some prosecutors and investigators wonder whether 
Brooklier's long association with mob figures has made him more reluctant than 
other lawyers to allow his clients to cooperate with government investigations 
of organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the Mafia works is, they need house counsel," says one longtime 
organized-crime investigator, who asked not to be identified. "What they need 
is somebody the Mafia knows will not run to the prosecution and make a deal and 
give up the rest of the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
"The mystery about Tony is, which hat does he have on at what time of day? A 
lot of his clients are mob guys. Why do they go to him? Is it because they know 
they can trust him?" 
</P>
<P>
Many criminal defense lawyers frequently encourage their clients to agree to 
testify against other co-defendants as a way of obtaining more lenient 
sentences. Brooklier, however, has almost never negotiated a cooperation 
agreement on behalf of a client; in fact, he admits, independent record 
promoter Ralph Tashjian's recent agreement to cooperate in the government's 
long-running investigation into payola in the entertainment industry is the 
first he has ever negotiated as a lawyer. And it "took a lot of soul searching" 
before he decided it would be in Tashjian's best interests to cooperate, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget, the prosecutorial agency that Tashjian has agreed to cooperate 
with is the prosecutorial agency that put my father in jail, where he died. OK? 
So I had a lot of personal things to overcome," Brooklier says. 
</P>
<P>
Given that he leaves decisions on whether to cooperate up to his clients, why 
is it that it has happened only once in more than a decade? "I think a lot of 
it has to do with my background," he says slowly, pausing to ponder the 
question. "My background is, you don't enter into an agreement with someone and 
then, when everybody gets caught, turn on them. You take your lumps. And I've 
had to reconcile that with my obligations as a lawyer. My obligation as a 
lawyer comes first." 
</P>
<P>
In court, Brooklier has a reputation for meticulous preparation and a 
dangerously disarming style. In the midst of a major organized-crime 
racketeering case with half a dozen defendants, several prosecutors said, 
Brooklier is usually the defense lawyer who doesn't stand up with constant 
objections. He smiles and shakes his head when asked if he wants to 
cross-examine a witness -- until the one witness with damaging testimony about 
his client takes the stand. Then he unloads a stinging interrogation he's been 
up all night preparing. 
</P>
<P>
The result, says former strike-force prosecutor John DuBois, who lost the 
Rizzitello stolen-securities case to Brooklier last year, is that the jury 
tends to forget everything about Brooklier's clients except the weaknesses in 
the cases against them. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people, in order to get noticed, have to scream and yell. Tony doesn't. 
He's sort of beyond that," says Asst. U.S. Atty. Mark Bonner, who believes 
Brooklier's direct, nonconfrontational style won a surprisingly lenient 
sentence for a woman Bonner believed to be a key player in a major cocaine 
ring. "You've gotta keep your eyes on him like a hawk, because if you don't, 
before you know it, your pants are off and you're standing there naked. He's a 
very dangerous customer. . . . He doesn't make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
AT GIUSEPPE Ristorante on any given Friday night, Brooklier is likely to finish 
his pasta and grab the microphone at the piano for a rendition of "Jailhouse 
Rock" (he loves Elvis) followed by "Volare" -- in Italian -- "for my mom." 
</P>
<P>
"We think Elvis Presley was Italian," Brooklier announced to the unwary diners 
one recent night. "Don't prepare to be entertained. Prepare to be appalled." 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't always seemed so lighthearted. His father's trial "almost killed 
him," and at first he didn't seem likely to recover, says his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like that for all of us," Frances Brooklier says. "The last time I saw 
(Dominic) in prison, I remember walking through the door, and he had aged so 
much. I turned around to go, and he had told me never to turn around, but I 
looked back and his shoulders looked like a man who was 90 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Tony left his wife, Nancy, soon after, and didn't move back in again until just 
a few months ago, before their 21st anniversary. "It seemed like he wanted to 
stay away from everybody he loved," Frances Brooklier recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklier says it was important for him to go home again to be with his two 
sons, ages 15 and 18, to be the kind of father to them that Dominic was to him. 
"It's very important to me," he said one night over dinner, tears suddenly, 
unexpectedly, streaming down his face, "that you understand that I respect my 
father. . . ." His voice faltered. "Ultimately -- " He stopped again to catch 
his breath. "And I miss him every day." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, it was suggested to him, the worst of it is the old dream again, but 
this time, the car wasn't turned away. This time, the father would be separated 
from the son for good. "He wasn't. Listen to me," Brooklier says, finally 
breaking down completely. "He was never separated from me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Yet life, as always, has a way of strolling on. Just last year, James 
Henderson, the prosecutor who put Tony's father in prison, launched a book 
project with Brooklier about the close friendship that had grown between the 
two men in the years since the trial. Although the book deal is indefinite at 
this point, Brooklier has signed a separate contract for a TV movie with the 
Guber-Peters Co. His agent? Bruce Kelton, the former strike-force prosecutor 
who also sat on the prosecution team, the guy who urged jurors to remember that 
Dominic Brooklier and his lieutenants were nothing more than "swines in a 
sewer." 
</P>
<P>
"Small world," Brooklier shrugs. "Isn't it?"

A MODERN AUNT'S TABLE ETIQUETTE QUIZ FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This is an excerpt from her forthcoming book, "Do I Have to Say Hello? Aunt 
Delia's Manners Quiz for Kids and Their Grownups," by Delia Ephron, with 
drawings by Edward Koren, to be published in November by Viking Penguin. 
Copyright 1989 by Delia Ephron and Edward Koren. 
</P>
<P>
 One day I picked up my 7-year-old nephew at LAX, and his first words were: 
"Take me to the baseball-card store." 
</P>
<P>
Hmm, I thought, how should I handle this? So I said, "OK, your aunt picks you 
up at the airport. She hasn't seen you in six months. Do you say, 'Hi, Aunt 
Delia' and give her a kiss? Do you say, 'No kisses, I hate kisses'? Do you say, 
'Take me to the baseball-card store'?" 
</P>
<P>
"The last one," said my nephew. 
</P>
<P>
It was an uphill battle. We moved from airport manners to car manners to table 
manners. Eventually the manners quiz became a book, but my nephew still hasn't 
answered one question correctly. I think this is on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Your aunt is making dinner and she asks you to set the table. 
</P>
<P>
Do you say, "I can't. I'm busy"? 
</P>
<P>
Do you moan and say, "Oh, OK, but I'm so tired"? 
</P>
<P>
Do you say, "Why should I have to set the table? Why doesn't Uncle Jerry? He 
never does anything"? 
</P>
<P>
Do you say, "Sure, Aunt Delia"? 
</P>
<P>
You put down place mats, plates, forks, knives, spoons, napkins and glasses. 
Finally you're finished. What do you say? 
</P>
<P>
"Would you like me to do anything else, Aunt Delia?" 
</P>
<P>
"OK, I did it, but next time, do it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Dinner is ready. You sit down. Where do you put your napkin? 
</P>
<P>
Around your neck? 
</P>
<P>
On your head? 
</P>
<P>
In your lap? 
</P>
<P>
Now your aunt is serving. She asks if you would like some chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Do you say, "Gimme"? 
</P>
<P>
Do you say, "Stick 'em up, Aunt Delia, and hand over your drumsticks"? 
</P>
<P>
Do you say, "I'd like a drumstick, please"? 
</P>
<P>
"What about some string beans? They're so delicious," says Aunt Delia. You hate 
string beans. What do you say? 
</P>
<P>
"Yuck." 
</P>
<P>
"Give them to Uncle Jerry. He looks like a string bean." 
</P>
<P>
"No, thank you." 
</P>
<P>
But suppose your aunt puts string beans on your plate without asking if you 
want them. What would you do then? 
</P>
<P>
Say, "String beans make me barf, Aunt Delia." 
</P>
<P>
Wait until she isn't looking and put a string bean up your nose. 
</P>
<P>
Just ignore the string beans and hope Aunt Delia is nice enough that she won't 
make you just eat one. 
</P>
<P>
Which of these is it OK to do while you eat dinner with your aunt and uncle? 
</P>
<P>
Beat your chest and yell, "Me, Tarzan!" 
</P>
<P>
Peel your scab. 
</P>
<P>
Listen to your Walkman. 
</P>
<P>
Read. 
</P>
<P>
Talk. 
</P>
<P>
Snore. 
</P>
<P>
Which of these are not appropriate subjects for dinner-table conversation? 
</P>
<P>
What Aunt Delia and Uncle Jerry did at work today. 
</P>
<P>
Tushies. 
</P>
<P>
The dead rat in Uncle Jerry and Aunt Delia's garage. 
</P>
<P>
Throw-up. 
</P>
<P>
Mucus. 
</P>
<P>
What you want to be when you grow up. 
</P>
<P>
That Aunt Delia looks about a hundred years old. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you can say without making a mistake, "One smart fellow, he felt smart. 
Two smart fellows, they felt smart. Three smart fellows, they all felt smart." 
</P>
<P>
You want another helping of corn. 
</P>
<P>
Do you say, "Please pass the corn, Uncle Jerry"? 
</P>
<P>
Do you say, "Yo, corn"? 
</P>
<P>
Do you bang the table with your knife until Aunt Delia and Uncle Jerry ask what 
you want? 
</P>
<P>
Do any of these drawings show the proper way to sit while you eat? 
</P>
<P>
When your uncle passes the corn, you notice that there is just a little bit 
left and nobody else has had seconds yet. You are the first. What do you do? 
</P>
<P>
Ask, "Does anyone else want seconds?" so that you can leave a little for other 
people at the table. 
</P>
<P>
Say, "Aunt Delia, you didn't make enough." 
</P>
<P>
Take it all. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose you took it all and then as soon as you put a big forkful of corn in 
your mouth, Aunt Delia asked what happened at school today? 
</P>
<P>
Do you wait until you're finished chewing and then tell her? 
</P>
<P>
Do you answer, spraying corn across the table? 
</P>
<P>
Do you open your mouth and point at what's inside so your aunt figures out you 
can't talk? 
</P>
<P>
Uncle Jerry burps by accident. 
</P>
<P>
Do you fall off your chair laughing? 
</P>
<P>
Do you keep eating, pretending you don't think it's funny because you don't 
want to embarrass Uncle Jerry? 
</P>
<P>
You burp on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Do you fall off your chair laughing? 
</P>
<P>
Do you say, "Excuse me"? 
</P>
<P>
Uh-oh, you have to sneeze. 
</P>
<P>
Do you cover your mouth and nose with your napkin and then do it? 
</P>
<P>
Do you aim straight at the chicken and then do it? 
</P>
<P>
Do you say, "Surprise, Uncle Jerry," and do it in his face? 
</P>
<P>
Uh-oh, Uncle Jerry has to sneeze. 
</P>
<P>
Do you duck? 
</P>
<P>
Do you say, "God bless you, Uncle Jerry"? 
</P>
<P>
Do you chant, "Do it again, do it again. I like it, I like it"? 
</P>
<P>
You are finished eating. What do you do with your knife and fork? 
</P>
<P>
Put them in your hair as if they were barrettes. 
</P>
<P>
Stab your leftover meat with them so they poke up like flagpoles. 
</P>
<P>
Place them lying down, side by side on the plate. 
</P>
<P>
What is the proper way to wipe your mouth? 
</P>
<P>
With your hand. 
</P>
<P>
With your T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
With your napkin. 
</P>
<P>
What is the proper way to inform your aunt and uncle that you are finished and 
would like to leave the table? 
</P>
<P>
A burp. 
</P>
<P>
"May I please be excused?" 
</P>
<P>
"See ya."

Laura San Giacomo ("sex, lies, and videotape") will be creating romantic sparks 
opposite Tom Cruise in Paramount's tentatively titled "Daytona," to shoot in 
November. The actress will play an ophthalmologist who initially encounters 
racer Cruise professionally. Tony Scott directs for producers Don Simpson and 
Jerry Bruckheimer. . . . But first things first: San Giacomo plays opposite Tom 
Selleck in Pathe's "Quigley Down Under," to film later this month in Australia. 
John Hill wrote the period Western centering on aboriginal rights, directed by 
Simon Wincer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The "Rocky" legend comes full circle when episode "V" goes before the cameras 
in November. Sylvester Stallone's script has the battered boxer on the ropes, 
coaching a young ring hopeful. Sly reunites the original creative team for the 
proposed finale, with John Avildsen directing and Robert Chartoff and Irwin 
Winkler producing. . . . 
</P>

Anthony Hopkins plays imprisoned serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lektor in Orion's 
"Silence of the Lambs," adapted by Thomas Harris from his best seller. Jodie

QUICK BREAKFASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
BREAKFAST is one of the fastest-growing segments of the restaurant business. 
What that mostly means is that more people are grabbing a cup of bad coffee and 
a greasy doughnut on their way to work. If they're feeling like being good to 
themselves, they might go for one of those egg sandwiches the fast-food joints 
seem to be touting with increasing fervor. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sad situation. And an unneccessary one, considering that breakfast is 
the day's easiest meal to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best places to stock up for good breakfasts is the Old Town Bakery 
in Pasadena. They bake more than ordinary muffins (although they do a good job 
with those). There are, for instance, the only homemade English muffins in the 
area. These monsters look like hockey pucks for giants, with a dense, chewy 
texture and a wholesome, homemade flavor. Half a muffin makes a fairly 
substantial meal. To put on top there are wonderful homemade four-berry 
preserves; unlike ordinary jams, these are filled with fruit, not very thick 
and not very sweet. 
</P>
<P>
If cereal's more like what you think of in the morning, Old Town Bakery makes 
its own granola filled with sliced nuts, dried fruits and whole grains. You get 
a container of the granola topped with fruit in season. All you have to do is 
pour a little milk on top; it's quicker than stopping at the fastest food joint 
-- and it keeps you going all day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Town Bakery is located at 166 W. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena; telephone 
(818) 792-7943. English muffins are 50 cents each, preserves are $4.50 a pint, 
and granola and fresh fruit is $3 a bowl.

GARDENS: GOING DUTCH IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, A RE-CREATION OF A TOWN GARDEN 
MAKES EXCELLENT USE OF A SMALL SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, Robert Smaus is an associate editor of Los Angeles Times 
Magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUTCH GARDENS of the 1680s are full of ideas for California gardens of the 
1980s, as can be seen at a re-creation currently on view at the Center for the 
Study of Decorative Arts in San Juan Capistrano. Designed by landscape 
historian James J. Yoch, the garden borrows ideas from typical 
upper-middle-class urban gardens in the Netherlands of the period. These were 
town gardens, small and compact, that made excellent use of the space 
available. Yoch's re-creation measures only 25x25 feet -- not much bigger than 
today's condominium garden. 
</P>
<P>
The garden is part of an exhibition called "The Reign of William and Mary: 
Anglo-Dutch Tradition," which examines the influence of these two monarchs, 
which was felt as far away as Colonial Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Trellises were used to enclose Dutch town gardens and provide a sense of 
privacy. Many of the features were miniatures of those found at much grander 
palaces; at one edge of Yoch's re-created garden, the trellis vaults over the 
walkway to form a berceau, a vine-shaded gallery. It is a miniature of the 
berceau at Paleis Het Loo at Apeldoorn, home of the House of Orange and 
William. Yoch also included a scaled-down triumphal arch at one end, which, he 
says, embraces "the custom of using imperial Roman architecture to rule 
gardens." Another custom was to personalize the garden with painted slogans: 
Lust en Rust means "Pleasure and Ease." 
</P>
<P>
There were no lawns in these compact gardens; in their stead, parterres were 
elaborately designed with plants and also materials such as crushed shells or 
colored gravel. (Williamsburg Colonists favored paths of oyster shell.) In this 
garden, the parterre takes the form of raised beds filled with flowery plants, 
and the paths are covered with decomposed granite. Many plants used in the 
re-created garden were in use in the late 1600s -- lavender, thyme, rosemary, 
passion flower, cannas, hibiscus, sweet bay, cycads, hibiscus, cannas and day 
lilies; William and Mary had a passion for the exotic plants that the Dutch 
trading companies brought back. Orange trees in pots and topiary of India 
hawthorne, ivy and boxwood balance the low raised beds. So that they could come 
inside for the winter, the more tender plants were grown in containers or were 
dug from the ground, unnecessary in California. 
</P>
<P>
Here, there is even a trompe-l'oeil of a canal under one of the large arches, a 
fixture of the time that provided a fictitious view out of the small gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Reign of William and Mary: Anglo-Dutch Tradition" garden can be seen 
Tuesday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., through Oct. 14, at 31431 
Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Admission is $3. For reservations for 
"The Gardens of the William and Mary Period and Their Continuing Influence 
Today," a two-day talk by James Yoch and Eric Haskell, on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1, 
telephone (714) 496-2132.

THE FACTS ABOUT VEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am disturbed that someone might believe Sandi Bouchard's ludicrously 
inaccurate letter (Sept. 3), which condemns Calendar and others for airing 
views about the condemnable (albeit legal) practices connected with formula-fed 
confined veal calves. 
</P>
<P>
White veal is an unnatural product obtained by unnatural means. Its production 
should be outlawed in this country as it has been in Sweden and some other 
countries. These nations are banning facts, not fictions.

MOTHER LOVE'S IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In her Sept. 3 letter on "Hot Radio" (Aug. 20), Claudia Anderson criticizes KFI 
talk-show personality Mother Love and urges that Calendar instead "focus on 
someone who provides (women) with a positive image." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks Mother Love has called for increased tolerance and respect for 
the gay population; appealed to rap singers to tone down profanity and use 
their music to positively influence youths; urged full-figured people to have 
more self-esteem and others to respect them more. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that Anderson has trouble transcending Mother Love's race or her 
full figure?

CRITIC'S VIEW OF KFAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bernheimer's article was an unusual farewell. The first half was oh so usual 
Bernheimer -- a little wit, clever short sentences, everything intended to trap 
us into a positive response. And the second half of the critique? He owns the 
word pompous. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been classy of him to have said good-by to KFAC with a bit of 
sentiment and a kindlier attitude. I know critics must criticize, but after 
all, there is a time for more understanding of a sad situation.

The word that stands out in Bernheimer's article is embarrassment, which he 
uses to describe the fact that "there will be no commercial (classical-music) 
radio station in Los Angeles." Let's face it, L.A. is not a sophisticated city. 
It's a beach town with all the name entails. Angelenos' idea of culture is 
eating designer pizza and getting tickets for "Les Miz" or "Phantom."

Artists' Jewellery, by CHARLOTTE GERE and GEOFFREY C. MUNN 
</P>
<P>
(Antique Collectors' Club; 1989) 
</P>
<P>
"Artists' Jewellery: Pre-Raphaelite to Arts and Crafts" offers an intriguing, 
intimate look at the artists, designers and jewelers who served England's 
royalty and aristocrats in the mid to late 19th Century. The text is a bit 
stilted, but the story is better told through the 103 color and 141 
black-and-white photographs and illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
From pencil sketches to final pieces, the authors share the talent of Dante 
Gabriel Rossetti, Sir Edwin Lutyens, Henry Wilson and William Holman-Hunt, 
among others. These men, in collaboration with emiment jewelers such as Carlo 
Giuliano, created one-of-a-kind keepsakes during the Pre-Raphaelite and Arts 
and Crafts period. Intricate tiaras, lockets, hair ornaments and brooches 
adorned with precious stones were also laden with symbols and secret messages 
popular during the period. The secrets are revealed in this richly detailed 
book.

JERRY WEINTRAUB'S STRUGGLE; 
</P>
<P>
CAN THE HOLLYWOOD MOGUL, PHILANTHROPIST AND CLOSE FRIEND OF THE PRESIDENT 
SALVAGE HIS FILM COMPANY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Weintraub, movie mogul, is scratching to save his company -- and he 
really doesn't want to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he acknowledged in a telephone interview, he is hard at work on a specific 
deal that could bail out his hit-starved Weintraub Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, former junk-bond king Michael Milken has joined the salvage effort, along 
with investment bankers Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.; Nomura Securities, and 
Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson N.V. -- not to mention Credit Lyonnais Bank 
Nederland N.V. and Bank of America, already heavy lenders to the independent 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
But, no, there is no danger of a bankruptcy filing, and no, Weintraub doesn't 
plan to give up the reins to his company. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my intention to remain in control . . . There, I've said it," concluded 
Weintraub, who has become Hollywood's latest emblem of fleeting success. 
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1987 with a promised $461 million in backing from big companies 
such as Columbia Pictures and Cineplex Odeon Corp., Weintraub Entertainment 
aimed to compete with the major studios on their own turf, making and releasing 
mainstream movies. Two years later, the company is fighting for survival. 
That's partly because a major portion of its much-touted funding didn't 
materialize, but largely because none of its films -- from "The Big Blue" 
through "The Gods Must Be Crazy II" -- hit the jackpot. Some, such as "Listen 
to Me" and "Troop Beverly Hills," were outright flops. 
</P>
<P>
In the way of Hollywood, the string of box-office failures has focused unusual 
attention on Weintraub, a 51-year-old show business insider who used to be best 
known for his charities and his long-standing ties to figures as wide-ranging 
as Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra and George Bush. Weintraub worked with the likes of 
Dylan and Sinatra during his long career as a concert promoter and later 
parlayed his celebrity connections and political largess into a wide network of 
influential friends, one of whom became the President. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street doesn't have a serious stake in Weintraub's company, since its 
stock -- over which he holds about 76% control -- doesn't trade publicly, and 
his $80 million in bonds are closely held by a small group of investors. But 
Hollywood deal makers, usually quick to offer their projects when a troubled 
firm finds new money, are watching closely to see if Weintraub can salvage his 
fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
"If he has one hit, everything changes. Then it's 'Jerry, how are you? Jerry, I 
need a little money for this charity I'm working on. Jerry, I've got a movie I 
want to show you,' " a producer who has worked closely with Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
One Weintraub friend said the executive has "gone underground," concealing his 
rescue efforts from even close associates. Months ago, he was in the Far East, 
negotiating with Japanese investors such as Funai Corp., a maker of video 
equipment, for a potential capital infusion. As those talks apparently failed, 
he became involved in talks with Stephen Swid, a New York investor who was 
cash-rich from his quick purchase and resale of the CBS music publishing 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Swid might have put up to $75 million into Weintraub's company -- enough to pay 
some of the bank debt and launch a new slate of films. But the two wound up in 
a standoff over control, and the talks stalled. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Weintraub talked with Warner Bros. about a new deal to 
distribute future films, reportedly in return for bigger advances than his 
Columbia contract allowed. By several accounts, Warner was interested, but 
Columbia refused to let him out of its contracts. Weintraub declined to comment 
on those accounts. 
</P>
<P>
When longtime friend and financier Milken, who is awaiting trial on 98 charges 
of violating federal securities laws, joined the salvage effort several weeks 
ago, Weintraub and his associates seemed confident that a bailout was just 
around the corner. Gerald Parsky, a company director and attorney, at the time 
said a restructuring "transaction" was imminent. Three weeks later, Weintraub 
made an overdue interest payment -- a week before he would have been in default 
on his bond agreements -- but the transaction has yet to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the principal value of Weintraub's company probably lies in its 
film library -- the acquisition of which initially threw his business out of 
kilter, according to some individuals familiar with the company. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub bought the 3,000-title movie and TV library on May 1, 1987, from 
financially strapped Cannon Group Inc. for $85 million plus 625,000 shares of 
Weintraub Entertainment stock valued at $7 a share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debt an Issue 
</P>
<P>
The purchase was consistent with conventional Hollywood wisdom that a cash flow 
from library sales is the best insurance against the brutal, hit-and-miss cycle 
of movie production. But it was also a massive undertaking for a company that 
was supposed to be devoting its capital to film making, and it saddled 
Weintraub Entertainment with about $50 million in loans from Credit Lyonnais 
and an additional $40 million in debt securities used to retire an interim loan 
from Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
With an eye on that debt and the rapidly deteriorating status of other 
independent film makers in 1987, Bank of America exercised its right not to 
proceed with an additional $95 million in credit -- the backbone of Weintraub's 
war chest. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after acquiring the library, Weintraub pressed Cannon into an 
arbitration in which Weintraub's company recovered both its stock and $3.8 
million to reflect the lower-than-expected quality of some of the library's 
contracts for sales. Yet one source closely familiar with Weintraub's finances 
now says the library -- which includes 10 Alfred Hitchcock films, as well as 
"Frances," "Tender Mercies," "Murder on the Orient Express" and other 
contemporary titles -- is probably worth between $150 million and $200 million, 
thanks largely to an explosion in European TV sales. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Columbia Pictures Entertainment and Cineplex-Odeon, both of which 
invested heavily in Weintraub Entertainment, have declined to discuss the 
company's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his financing travails, Weintraub has maintained his high profile in 
the philanthropic and political communities. He has been a mainstay of such 
charities as Cedars Sinai Hospital and Chabad House, a Westwood drug treatment 
center. Several months ago, even as his company came under financial pressure, 
Weintraub endowed five screenwriting scholarships at the University of Southern 
California, where the son of his right-hand man, Kenneth Kleinberg, is enrolled 
in the film program. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub's political friendships include Democratic congressmen Mel Levine and 
Howard Berman, Republican Sens. William S. Cohen and Pete Wilson, California 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Sitcom 
</P>
<P>
Levine, a liberal representative from Los Angeles, maintained that Weintraub, 
though a heavy contributor to candidates on both sides of the party ledger, is 
scrupulous in his political dealings. "He has never asked me for anything, and 
I believe he never wanted anything. Jerry's relationships are based on personal 
friendship and loyalty," said Levine. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, however, those political relationships have overlapped with his 
business affairs. Rep. Berman's wife Janis, for instance, received a fee from 
Weintraub Entertainment Group in exchange for a concept for a TV comedy about 
four congressmen who live in the same house. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman's wife hadn't previously worked as a professional screenwriter, 
and the show hasn't been produced for any network so far. Both Weintraub and 
Jean Smith, a spokeswoman for Rep. Berman, declined to say how much Janis 
Berman was paid. Weintraub said CBS expressed interest in the series, but he 
has "no idea" if it will ever be made. 
</P>
<P>
A mainstay of Nancy Reagan's anti-drug campaign, Weintraub two years ago 
produced 13 anti-drug "trailers" that were shown in movie theaters. The first 
trailer featured Nancy Reagan and Clint Eastwood, and others contained messages 
from Hollywood stars. 
</P>
<P>
But Weintraub himself has been periodically beset by rumors that he has had a 
drug problem, despite his strong public stance against illegal drug use. 
</P>
<P>
During an emotional interview at his Palm Springs resort home this spring, 
Weintraub passionately denied the drug rumors. He said: "I do not have a drug 
problem. I do not do drugs. I can't say that I never did drugs, but I'm not 
saying that I did do drugs. I never did drugs on any kind of a sustained basis 
or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Friendship 
</P>
<P>
Outside Hollywood, Weintraub's best calling card is his close relationship with 
President Bush -- a relationship that took root long before either man rose to 
great prominence. The President underscored that friendship two months ago by 
assuring a pair of Times reporters that he had personally entertained Weintraub 
at the White House only an hour and a half before the reporters' visit. 
</P>
<P>
Both men have homes in the clubby resort town of Kennebunkport, Me. Bush owns a 
rambling, field-stone complex on Walker's Point, a family property that he 
bought from his mother in 1981. The Weintraubs, while living primarily in 
Malibu and Beverly Hills, often spend summers about three miles away, in a big, 
yellow frame house called "Blueberry Hill." 
</P>
<P>
"Blueberry Hill" belongs to Weintraub's wife, 65-year-old singer Jane Morgan 
Weintraub (nee Florence Currier), whose family made close connections with the 
Bushes while summering in Kennebunkport over 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known George Bush since he was 12 years old," explained Robert Currier, 
the singer's 76-year-old brother. In the 1930s, Currier built the Kennebunkport 
Playhouse, which drew support from the Bushes and the Walkers, the family of 
George Bush's mother. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, George Bush, by then married, saw Jane Morgan perform at the 
playhouse and struck up a fast friendship. The singer introduced the rising 
politician to Jerry Weintraub -- who had been her agent -- after her marriage 
in 1964, and did her share to boost Bush's political career by singing at 
fund-raisers during his Texas congressional campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Bush Ellis, the President's sister, finds Weintraub a natural fit among 
Bush's most intimate advisers. "Oh, they're close," she said. "Jerry's like 
(Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.) Brady and (Secretary of State James A.) Baker 
and all of them. A very quiet, comfortable guy. Just the kind of guy my brother 
likes." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, believe that Bush, the consummate preppie, was attracted to 
Weintraub, the Brooklyn-born son of a traveling salesman, precisely because 
they are opposites. "Jerry's got warmth, he's got humor, he's got a spark. I 
think the President sees him as a person he can let his hair down with . . . 
And I think Jerry gives him a little window on Hollywood," said former U.S. 
Sen. John V. Tunney, a friend to both. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talent Agency Start 
</P>
<P>
Yet, others contend that Weintraub befriended Bush more than 10 years ago -- 
when most Hollywood support went to Democrats and the rest to favorite son 
Ronald Reagan -- in a simple bid for personal power. "Jane explained to me that 
(Weintraub) wanted to make some kind of indentation in Southern California for 
backing politicians," Currier said of his brother-in-law. "He has no values as 
far as people go. He just likes to bet on something that's going to win." 
</P>
<P>
A high school graduate who enlisted in the Air Force as a radio operator, 
Weintraub broke into show business as an assistant agent with the Music Corp. 
of America talent agency in New York -- and soon developed a sense of destiny 
to match that of his chief political friend. 
</P>
<P>
According to friends, he has often said he expects to die a billionaire. 
Apparently believing himself well on the way to the billion-dollar mark, 
Weintraub in 1987 boasted to a reporter: "I'm a guy who has become one of the 
most successful men not just in the entertainment business, but in the world. 
I'm one of the richest people in the world." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, his personal fortune, though associates put it in the tens of millions 
of dollars, appears much too small to rank Weintraub among Forbes magazine's 
annual listing of the 400 richest people in America; and his business career 
has been a jumble of successes and failures. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, having long parted with MCA, Weintraub built a powerful dual 
business around Concerts West, a promotion firm that he co-owned with Tom 
Hulett, and Management III, a music management firm that handled such stars as 
Neil Diamond, John Denver and Dolly Parton. But both firms sagged in the 1980s, 
as the top stars left, many of them, according to associates, citing their 
inability to hold Weintraub's attention as he became increasingly enthralled 
with the movie business. 
</P>
<P>
As an independent film producer, Weintraub won critical acclaim with 
"Nashville" and "Diner" and scored big with "Oh, God," a major hit for John 
Denver, and "The Karate Kid," which has led to a pair of sequels for Columbia. 
He was a powerful creative force, according to associates, and an attractive 
figure to the upper echelon of Hollywood executives. "Jerry is extremely 
vivacious, entertaining, and pleasant," said Disney chairman Michael D. Eisner. 
"(He) is a good friend." 
</P>
<P>
But Weintraub's 1986 stint as chairman of United Artists ended after just five 
months, when he left in a bitter dispute with majority owner Kirk Kerkorian, 
who claimed that Weintraub was overspending and underproducing at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freewheeling Style 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub, who owned approximately 2.5 million UA shares, later said: "I just 
didn't realize at the time, in my exuberance, that when a guy owns 70% of the 
store and you own 11%, it's his store, it's not your store . . . Eventually 
there had to be some problems . . . I don't work for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Months after leaving UA, Weintraub launched his own company with a burst of 
publicity that focused on his funding and his freewheeling style. 
</P>
<P>
The company's debut film was "The Big Blue," a French-made picture about the 
rivalry between a pair of champion "free-divers," who compete by holding their 
breath while diving to great depths. In a burst of enthusiasm, Weintraub made a 
handshake deal to acquire U.S. distribution rights to the movie immediately 
outside the theater where he first saw it during a Paris junket with four other 
Weintraub executives. 
</P>
<P>
But the movie, which starred Rosanna Arquette, took in a disastrous $3 million 
at the U.S. box office. And "My Stepmother Is An Alien," a major Christmas 
film, took in only about $13 million, despite heavy production and marketing 
costs after Weintraub insisted on releasing it simultaneously with Universal's 
"Twins," which many industry observers had already tagged as the toughest film 
to beat in the big studios' Christmas lineup. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, "Troop Beverly Hills," "Listen to Me," "She's Out of 
Control," and the "The Gods Must Be Crazy II" haven't pulled in significant 
revenue for Weintraub. Plans to produce a film version of the stage musical 
"Evita" are still simmering, but Weintraub said he won't make the movie unless 
a dispute over its budget is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
To make new movies, Weintraub may need to restaff many key positions in his 
company. Among those who have left Weintraub Entertainment since last fall are 
Lynne Wasserman, senior vice president; film unit heads, Guy McElwaine and 
David Kirkpatrick; Harry Usher, acquisitions chief; Larry Sugar, library sales 
director, and David Weitzner, marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the exodus, the company continued to spend freely on salaries and 
perquisites. As chairman, Weintraub has made $1.5 million a year (some of which 
he deferred last year), has enjoyed a Rolls Royce supported by a company car 
allowance and often chartered private jets rather than flying on commercial 
aircraft. But top executives vigorously attacked "extras" such as executive 
magazine subscriptions and parking validations for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Internal Conflicts 
</P>
<P>
Kleinberg, president and chief operating officer, has said the production 
company probably spent less on executive perquisites than other movie studios. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company, which has about 150 employees, has suffered through a 
series of personal flare-ups. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Vida Theresia Walter filed a sexual harassment claim against 
Weintraub, contending that she was fired after working as a temporary secretary 
for one week. Walter claimed that she was told by a personnel manager that she 
had to leave the company because she "wore a wedding ring" and that "Mr. 
Weintraub is a playboy." California officials declined to say how the claim was 
resolved and Walter couldn't be located. 
</P>
<P>
The personnel manager, Linda Quinn, said Walter's charge was untrue but that 
Weintraub subsequently pressured her into leaving in the belief that she had 
supported Walter. Weintraub denied that he had pressured either woman. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub raised eyebrows in Hollywood when he fired Lynne Wasserman, the 
48-year-old daughter of MCA's powerful chairman Lew Wasserman, because he 
suspected her of leaking information to Forbes magazine about the hitch in his 
bank negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
After a stormy session in his office, Weintraub had Wasserman escorted to her 
car by a security officer. Both declined to discuss the incident. But an 
individual familiar with the Forbes report maintained that Wasserman didn't 
leak the information, which had already been disclosed in a Securities and 
Exchange Commission filing. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such encounters, Weintraub still has many supporters. Not least among 
them is ex-Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, a company investor and 
director, who became associated with Weintraub Entertainment through Parsky, 
his former business partner. Simon maintained earlier this year that the 
company was simply hurt by the kind of bad luck that can hit any studio. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything is wrong. A couple of movies didn't sell," said Simon. 
"(Movie producer Steven) Spielberg has had problems every once in a while. It 
doesn't mean he's snake-bitten."

JAMES FLANIGAN: LATEST TAX PLANS CAN HELP, BUT JUST A FIRST STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news on taxes is that suddenly Congress wants you to pay less. The House 
Ways and Means committee has just approved a cut in the tax rate for capital 
gains, and the Senate Finance committee will get a proposal this week from its 
chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), to broaden eligibility for 
tax-deductible individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the public won't get both a cut in the capital gains rate and 
expanded IRA deductibility. Political scrimmaging, rather than solicitude for 
taxpayers, accounts for the two being proposed. 
</P>
<P>
But both ideas -- tax breaks for investments, or for savings -- will be debated 
in the next two weeks as Congress puts together legislation to reduce the 
budget deficit. So taxpayers have an opportunity not only to let lawmakers know 
what they want but also to see some results. Because one idea or the other will 
become law. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the specifics: The capital gains proposal would allow you to exclude 
30% of your profits from the sale of stock, real estate and most other 
investments if they are held more than one year. It would tax the other 70% at 
a top rate of 28% -- the 33% super rate would not apply -- meaning the true tax 
on capital gains would be 19.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The Bentsen proposal would allow taxpayers not now eligible to deduct from 
taxable income $1,000 of the $2,000 they put into an IRA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inescapable Fact 
</P>
<P>
So which is better -- savings or investment? Obviously, the question is 
nonsense. Savings are invested, and most people's investments represent their 
savings. And the inescapable fact is that Americans need to invest more and 
save more. Republicans and Democrats agree on that, which is why in a time of 
deficits, Congress is considering tax incentives that theoretically reduce 
government revenue. 
</P>
<P>
But in debate, many Democrats oppose capital gains reductions as doing more for 
the wealthy than for the general public. Republicans counter that the 
constituency for capital gains is broader than the Democrats claim. 
</P>
<P>
Who is right? Forgetting for a moment that there can be a serious philosophical 
question about taxing capital earnings less than wages for labor, the 
Republicans are right when they say the capital gains constituency is broad. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls consistently show that Americans support a lower tax rate on 
capital gains. "Even people who are not going to have a capital gain anytime 
soon support it," says a Washington tax expert. 
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons for that. More people hold assets -- inherited or 
pension fund stock, real estate, etc. -- that they will sell at some point. 
Also, more Americans are in business for themselves these days -- even 
part-time -- and building up capital assets. A Treasury survey taken in 1985 
showed that most capital gains transactions were on tax returns reporting 
income of less than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
So capital gains tax reduction looks like a winner. And the present legislation 
-- a short-term law that expires in two years -- will also reduce the budget 
deficit, because it will spur people to sell stocks they've held for a long 
time. Their tax payments will raise Treasury revenue for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Quick a Fix 
</P>
<P>
The proposal's weakness, however, is that it's a quick fix. The Bush 
Administration would prefer reducing capital gains rates to 15% if investments 
were held for three years. And the Rebuild America Foundation, which is backed 
by Democratic politicians, would reduce taxes to zero on investments held seven 
to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, those are the kinds of capital gains tax measures that need to 
become law in America. 
</P>
<P>
Because the competitive statistics are becoming embarrassing: In 1989 Japan 
will invest more in plant and equipment than the United States -- $569.9 
billion for Japan, $513.9 billion for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And that's sad. Because Japan's economy is only 60% as large as the U.S. 
economy. Yet it is investing more in its industry and workers. 
</P>
<P>
So what does Japan do on taxes? It keeps them low on investment and savings. 
Until last year, Japan imposed no tax at all on capital gains or savings 
income. Now it taxes capital gains at 5% and savings at 3%. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. taxpayers, and the Congress, might keep those figures in mind during the 
coming debate.

EXPLOITED UNDERCLASS OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS IS FERTILE GROUND FOR UNION 
ORGANIZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Flanigan, in his Aug. 23 column ("Why Cheers for a Polish Union, Scorn 
for Ours?"), claims that today's unions are becoming a victim of their own 
success. The relatively high wages and good benefits unionization has brought 
make it tougher to organize new workers, he argues; employees don't believe 
unions can produce anything for them today. 
</P>
<P>
Most of my union's 32,000 members are employed in the Los Angeles food 
industry. They offered views contrary to Flanigan's in recent confidential 
in-depth surveys conducted by the respected Washington, D.C.-based Wilson 
Center for Public Research. By roughly a 15-to-1 ratio, food workers indicated 
they would be worse off without union representation. 
</P>
<P>
Behind this union loyalty were insights not covered in the column. Fear of 
arbitrary treatment by management and lack of job security without union 
protections were only two of the points workers cited. 
</P>
<P>
Flanigan argues that union-won reforms since the 1930s and a work force 
shifting from an industrial to a service economy have diminished labor's clout. 
But he ignores the impact of an underclass of immigrant laborers who dominate 
key sectors of the work force in many parts of Los Angeles. They still 
experience the exploitation and poverty that plagued Depression-era workers. 
And they are fertile ground for unionization. My union has scored gains in 
organizing and winning contract gains for mostly Hispanic workers in area 
meatpacking plants. Other unions are also targeting companies made up of 
low-paid Spanish-speaking employees. 
</P>
<P>
Labor does face severe challenges. A critical problem -- one ignored entirely 
by Flanigan -- is the utter failure of the nation's labor laws to protect 
workers from illegal union-busting tactics. But the labor movement has a future 
so long as it protects union members -- as only it can -- from the caprice of 
management, and embraces workers who are still disadvantaged.

DOMINO'S PIZZA FOUNDER TELLS WHY HE MAY SELL HIS FIRM TO DEVOTE MORE ENERGY TO 
CHARITABLE CAUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MONAGHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Monaghan, sole owner of the huge Domino's Pizza chain, startled many people 
early last week by disclosing that he is thinking about selling his Ann Arbor, 
Mich.-based company to devote his life to charity. Why would someone such as 
Monaghan -- who has been criticized in the past for his ostentatious displays 
of wealth -- decide to give up the business career that made him rich and 
famous? In the following column, Monaghan tells his story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In 1960, my brother Jim and I borrowed $500 and decided to purchase an existing 
restaurant and turn it into a pizza store in Ypsilanti, Mich. My brother wasn't 
persuaded that the idea of pizza delivery would work, and he soon decided to 
leave the company. We had little cash, so I gave him the company Volkswagen as 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
Quite frankly, I also often wondered whether the idea would work, but we kept 
at it and today Domino's Pizza is the world's largest pizza delivery company, 
with 5,100 stores in 18 countries and annual systemwide sales exceeding $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, I announced in a letter to our employees and franchisees that I was 
exploring the idea of selling Domino's Pizza. Some folks wonder why I'd make 
such a stir before I'd actually make a decision and finally sell. Personally, I 
like to sleep at night so we felt it was better to be open and honest with our 
employees from the start. 
</P>
<P>
I thought I alluded to this idea of stepping aside when I appointed Dave Black, 
a longtime employee, to be president last spring. But this recent announcement 
has created quite a stir. 
</P>
<P>
I guess the question everyone is asking is, "Why would a 52-year-old man, with 
a beautiful wife and four lovely daughters, spend his entire life trying to get 
to the top and then, once he gets there, think about selling it?" 
</P>
<P>
Don't let anyone kid you, it's not easy. 
</P>
<P>
My life is going through a process where material things don't mean as much to 
me as when I was younger. I spent part of my childhood in an orphanage, and I 
didn't have a lot of material possessions. I've always had a dual personality, 
I guess. I admire P. T. Barnum, but I also admire Pope John Paul II. I admire 
the flamboyancy of Donald J. Trump, but I also admire Mother Teresa. I think 
you get the picture. But as you get older, you find that the material things 
really don't mean as much as people think. After all, the ultimate goal is the 
hereafter or heaven so it's not going to matter how much or what you have. 
</P>
<P>
In my letter to our employees and franchisees, I said that I wanted to spend 
more time on the Domino's Pizza Foundation, which supports the church, the arts 
and education. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Carnegie once said that "it's easier to make money than give it away." I 
used to laugh at that notion, but it's really true. There are so many people 
and places to help, and so little time to do it. Over recent years, I've tried 
to take an active role in the Roman Catholic Church. We've started a group 
called Legatus, which is an organization of Catholic presidents of companies, 
and our goal is to help the church and encourage business leaders to use their 
faith to lead. Elsewhere, we're supporting a missionary in Honduras, and we 
enjoy visiting and helping out with our efforts down there. Because of my love 
of architecture, I've been challenged by the Vatican to help design a chapel 
that could be built and implemented by parishes around the world. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the church, we've also been active in supporting the University 
of Michigan's athletic program and architecture school, along with Mott 
Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor. To sum it up, working with the foundation is 
a very time-consuming job, and I've found that it is not fair to try to divide 
my time between the company and the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I'm a good Catholic, but that always has 
been a goal and still is. I've always wondered why I ended up so successful and 
I figure there must be someone out there watching over me, so maybe it's time 
to pay some of those favors back. 
</P>
<P>
The question's been asked if the boycott of Domino's Pizza by the National 
Organization of Women concerning my support of the Committee to End 
State-Funded Abortions in Michigan has affected my thinking. It probably hasn't 
because the boycott really hasn't hurt businesses. However, I wouldn't want my 
support of such social issues to hurt my franchisees in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Until I do make a decision, people are asking what exactly is going to happen 
to Domino's Pizza. As I see it, there are four options: Go public, merge with 
an existing company, sell to a public or private company, or do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
If and when I do walk away from it, the decision won't be an easy one. I still 
wake in the middle of the night dreaming about a "rush" in the pizza store (a 
large number of pizza orders at one time), even though I have not been in a 
store full time in years. 
</P>
<P>
There's much speculation right now on what Domino's Pizza is worth, and that's 
what we're trying to figure out. I can assure you that if we do sell, the new 
owners will be getting the finest management team around. 
</P>
<P>
We're currently not actively negotiating with anyone because it's way too early 
in the process. I also have to consider planning my estate and my family's 
future welfare. I know this talk tends to lead to speculation that I'm in bad 
health or something. I can assure you that I'm in great health and I run six 
miles each day. I have tons of energy but I guess I want to redirect those 
energies. 
</P>
<P>
Parting with Domino's Pizza would be extremely difficult because of one more 
factor and probably the most important one -- my wife Margie. Because I've 
eaten, breathed and slept Domino's Pizza for almost three decades, she doesn't 
think I'll be able to walk away from it. Margie is probably the most important 
person in my life, and a man couldn't ask for a better wife and friend. She's 
been with me through thick and thin, so obviously her input will play a role in 
my final decision. 
</P>
<P>
My wife doesn't want me to sell and my management team doesn't want me to sell. 
I'm at a crossroads in my life. But then again, that's why you have faith.

MILKEN SMEAR CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to know the meaning of two stories that ran in The Times Sept. 1 
and 2 regarding the alleged relationship between Michael Milken and Ivan 
Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
Just how did almost-2-year-old "confidential" Securities and Exchange 
Commission memos based on gossip by unnamed sources find their way into the 
hands of the news media? Who is responsible for this hideously unethical 
behavior by a government agency that is "supposed" to be serving and protecting 
the investment community? 
</P>
<P>
These stories are another example of what appears to be a maliciously 
orchestrated scheme of leaks and innuendoes generated to create a public smear 
campaign against Milken. 
</P>
<P>
He has been unwavering in declaring his innocence and deserves a fair trial. 
Somewhere -- behind government doors, it seems -- there is a deliberate attempt 
being made to sabotage that process. 
</P>
<P>
When the press is being used as a courtroom, we the people of the United States 
should be scared to death.

THE JIM BAKKER SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Amazing Disgrace" by Garry Abrams, Sept. 1: Amazing disgrace -- a 
cute play on "religious" words. The media, particularly newspapers, are full of 
them these days. 
</P>
<P>
The "second coming," referring to the second time Jesus Christ will come to 
Earth (for those with no knowledge of the original context), is another one. 
That theme's been used to report everything from the repopularization of motion 
picture characters to the comebacks of sports celebs. 
</P>
<P>
There are other examples, left unmentioned for the sake of brevity, all with 
religious overtones. Although trite, I'd stop short of calling it cheap 
journalism, even for subjects of such cosmic significance to mankind. There is, 
however, an inherent disregard (at the very least thoughtlessness) for the 
sacred in all of this -- ultimately to our discredit and misfortune.

May I suggest that Garry Abrams was stretching it a little when he reported on 
the Jim Bakker saga? He reported that the water slide at Bakker's amusement

inner tubes to the top of the slide looked "like penitents cimbing to a

<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations to Garry Abrams on his excellent article "Amazing Disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
Who says the theater is dead? Jim Bakker has had many years of success in his 
ongoing role as a telecharlatan minister's telecharlatan minister. He is an 
experienced actor who could've given the great Olivier lessons. 
</P>
<P>
I hope Bakker's judge and jury view his apparent "psychological deterioration" 
with the eye of a skeptical theater critic. With Bakker's "sense of drama and 
staging," he just may be attempting to give the greatest performance of his 
life.

THE BARGAIN CORNER: PASSES CUT TOKYO COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cost of getting around Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka can be eased by 
transportation passes. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo there is the one-day open ticket that costs about $4.50 U.S. It 
provides unlimited travel on all subways. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there's a Tokyo combination ticket that is valid on all subways, 
streetcars, buses and trains in the metropolitan Tokyo area. This ticket costs 
about $10 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Kyoto has a one-day subway pass for unlimited travel for about 
$6.90. In addition, this pass includes some bus routes. Osaka has a one-day 
subway pass that covers some bus and tram routes for about $5.75. 
</P>
<P>
The passes must be bought in these cities, and are good only on day of 
purchase. That means the earlier in the day that you buy a pass, the more you 
can use it. Subways and buses stop service at about midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a recent 3% tax on most purchases in Japan, the Japan rail pass still 
offers a good way to explore the country. The cost for unlimited rail travel on 
a seven-day pass is about $266 first-class and $200 second-class. Two- and 
three-week passes also are available. The rail passes, however, have to be 
bought outside of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Names of subways and train stations are in English and Japanese. Some offer 
computerized signs that show location and indicate directions. There are also 
special telephone numbers in Tokyo and Kyoto (as well as toll-free numbers for 
western and eastern Japan) where you can get information in English from 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact the Japan National Tourist Organization, 624 S. 
Grand Ave., Suite 2640, Los Angeles 90017, (213) 623-1952. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to see Japan by ship, a new line, Oceanic Cruises, is sailing its 
120-passenger Oceanic Grace around the Japanese islands and Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Through 1990 the line is offering complimentary round-trip, economy-class 
flights from major U.S. gateways, including Los Angeles, to Tokyo to pick up 
the sailings, which can be combined with other travel in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
The line also is offering a free one-night hotel stay until the end of this 
year, either before or after the cruise, in Tokyo or in any city on the cruise 
itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of a seven-night sailing is $3,395, the same price levied in Japan, 
according to a spokesman. The price is the same for all cabins, which are 
identical. 
</P>
<P>
Contact travel agents or the SMI Group, the line's agent in the United States, 
at toll-free (800) 545-5778. JACK ADLER

STUDENT-RUN MONTREAL HOTEL IS REALLY A CLASS ACT 
</P>

MONTREAL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travelers delight in Hotel de l'Institut because of its location -- dead center 
of this city's Latin Quarter on Rue St.-Denis, a street that has been compared 
to Boulevard St. Germain in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel also sits across the street from Square St. Louis and, literally, 
atop the Sherbrooke Metro Station. 
</P>
<P>
Guests are within walking distance of many restaurants in three dining 
districts. And from the Sherbrooke Metro Station they have access to almost all 
of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Some travelers choose the hotel because of its modest price. My wife and I paid 
about $75 U.S. for a room with two beds, which included a substantial buffet 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
You'll get pink smoked salmon, among other delicacies. Plus freshly baked 
pastries and rolls. The daily buffet is in the sixth-floor dining room. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel has 40 rooms plus two suites, and is an appendage to a larger and 
more ambitious operation. 
</P>
<P>
It is a training site or laboratory for a public school, Institut de Tourisme 
et D'Hotellerie du Quebec, sponsored by the tourism arm of the provincial 
government of Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
The school operates the hotel. Students and teachers perform the work, with the 
exception of a handful of regular employees, who spell the students when they 
attend class. 
</P>
<P>
Students handle the reception desk, clean the rooms, make the beds, do the 
cooking and serve in the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's first floor offers a conventional lobby, pleasant and spacious. The 
second through the fifth floors are devoted to classrooms and laboratories, 
including the kitchens in which the tasty buffet items are prepared. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the breakfasts, dining rooms offer lunch and dinner Monday 
through Friday. Dinner costs about $16 U.S. per person. 
</P>
<P>
Guests may order hard liquor or wine with lunch or dinner. A small bar that 
once operated in conjunction with the hotel has been closed because, despite 
the hotel's popularity, business did not justify keeping it open. 
</P>
<P>
Guest quarters are on the seventh and eighth floors. Rooms are large and airy, 
and they contain color TV as well as other amenities one would expect from a 
topnotch hotel. Also, students maintain them immaculately. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is a public school, tuition at the institute is free. About 75% of 
the youths are from the Montreal area, the other from other parts of the 
province of Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
A substantial number are enrolled in hotel management. Others aspire to be 
cooks or pastry chefs, travel agents and tour guides. 
</P>
<P>
High school youths of 16 and 17 years are enrolled as well as older students. 
</P>
<P>
The entrance to the hotel, which has operated since 1976, is off St. Denis, 
where guest cars are stored in an underground garage for about $6 U.S. a night. 
We did our sightseeing by foot and metro. 
</P>
<P>
We dined memorably, in one of the three districts that are saturated with 
restaurants of considerable ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
One district along St. Denis starts about 1 1/2 blocks south of the hotel. 
There are also several inviting restaurants along St. Denis to the north. 
</P>
<P>
The others are the Deluth district (about half a mile to the north). To reach 
the third, cross the street from the hotel to leafy Square St. Louis and walk 
through to Prince Arthur Street, which runs about five blocks as a pedestrian 
mall that's lined with only restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurants are good, mostly moderately priced and you can take along your 
own wine that can be bought at one of the many nearby shops. 
</P>
<P>
From the Sherbrooke Metro Station you'll also want to visit Old Montreal and 
the Place d'Armes Station, where the subway stops. 
</P>

FOOTLOOSE: IT'S A TALE OF TWO CITIES ON HAWAII'S KOHALA COAST 
</P>

KAMUELA, Hawaii 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This town on the Big Island has a split personality in more ways than one. 
First, it has two names. Also, when it's sunny at one end of the village, the 
rains at the other end could scare Noah. 
</P>
<P>
The names resulted after John Parker, a New England seafarer who walked off his 
ship here in 1809, married King Kamehameha's granddaughter, had a son named 
Samuel (Kamuela in Hawaiian) and made the town his namesake. Many early 
settlers, however, preferred Waimea (red water). As a result, both names are 
used. 
</P>
<P>
The meteorological change is caused by Waimea-Kamuela's upcountry location -- 
between the relatively dry western Kohala Coast and the rain-forest wetness of 
the Hamakua Coast to the east. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, hotels and restaurants are sprouting like wildflowers, real estate 
prices are erupting and everyone believes that the town and coast have very 
rosy futures. 
</P>
<P>
Even mainlanders will agree that the Kohala Coast and this very pretty little 
town have plenty of room to grow before suffering development pains. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: United is the only airline that will get you to the Big Island 
without changes. American, Pan Am, Delta, Northwest, Continental and TWA will 
take you to Honolulu, with Aloha and Hawaiian Airlines flying onward. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Stay a week, at least. All sorts of accommodations in 
moderate prices. Dining the same. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: A rental car is a must for seeing the Big Island. Most firms 
have desks at the airport. Dollar Hawaii gives out a booklet with discounts at 
70 dining spots. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: The Royal Waikoloan (Box 5000, Waikoloa; $90 to $175 
double) has a large indoor-outdoor lobby, seven restaurants and lounges, big 
bedrooms with private balconies or lanai. The beach is a step away and golf and 
tennis are available. The rooms are $90. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Ranch Lodge (Box 458, Kamuela; $58-$67 double) has 20 rooms, all 
enormous. Painted barn red with white trim, the lodge looks like a well-kept 
stable. It offers handsome-pine bedroom furnishings, fresh flowers and a 
refrigerator. The lodge is at village center. Good restaurants are nearby. The 
coast is about 20 minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
Mauni Lani Point Condominiums (Kohala Coast) charges $150 to $180 for one 
bedroom, $210 and up for two and three bedrooms. It has daily maid service, 
equipped kitchen, washer-dryer, a pool, a Jacuzzi, a sauna, a color TV and a 
general store nearby for provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Units are on Mauni Lani Bay Hotel's golf course. The tennis club is a short 
walk away. Condo guests get privileges for both and other hotel facilities. 
</P>
<P>
For other particulars, call toll-free (800) 642-6284. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Hawaiian cuisine is slowly developing a measure of 
character beyond poi and the luau. Although seafood has always been plentiful 
and fresh daily, it still is a chore to get it without the sweet sauce that 
hides its delicate flavors. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the local fish not swimming in sauces are opakapaka, a pink or red 
snapper with flaky meat; onaga, snapper with whiter meat; mahi-mahi, a 
non-mammal dolphin that is the state's most popular fish; ono, a king mackerel 
that's also called wahoo, and ahi, a yellowfin tuna that's popular broiled or 
used in sushi and sashimi. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Island's Parker Ranch beef (10 million pounds produced yearly) is used. 
French and California wines are readily available but costly. 
</P>
<P>
Dining: Bree Garden restaurant (Waimea-Kamuela) is new and elegant, the work of 
German owner-chef Bernd Bree. There are framed wall displays of antique German 
dining silver, old butter molds and 19th-Century fashion prints in the small 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
The menu offers pepper-broiled salmon steak, Wiener schnitzel, honeyed rack of 
lamb, prawns in an Amaretto, brandy and cream sauce, plus plenty of other 
seafood. 
</P>
<P>
The Canoe House (Mauna Lani Bay Hotel) is the newest dining spot on the island. 
Room and terrace are open to the beach and decorated with old Hawaiian paddles, 
canoes and other nautical artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is imaginative: bamboo-steamed mahi-mahi, wok-fried snapper, smoked 
duck with jicama-mango relish and grilled shrimp, scallops and Japanese 
eggplant with fresh taro chips. 
</P>
<P>
Merriman's (Kamuela) is another new spot opened by a young man determined to 
improve Hawaiian dining. Peter Merriman uses fresh seafood, Parker Ranch beef 
and Kahua Ranch lamb to creat a menu that draws locals in droves. 
</P>
<P>
Try his marlin ceviche with peppers and cilantro, wok-charred marlin or the 
Thai-style shrimp curry. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: The Mauna Kea Beach Hotel (Queen Kaahumanu Highway; 
$220-$330 double) is still queen of the Big Island hotels and the standard by 
which other luxury resorts in the Pacific are measured. Mauna Kea's Batik 
dining room is considered the island's finest. The Pavilion, Garden and 
Japanese Terrace restaurants offer a broad choice of dining adventures. A 
children's program also is bringing Mauna Kea an ever-younger family business. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: The Kohala Coast is strung out along the western shore of the Big 
Island, from Keahole Airport north to the island's tip. Hawaii is a volcanic 
island, with such greenery as you see on Kohala in patches around hotels, 
public beaches (not too many) and the town of Waimea-Kamuela. 
</P>
<P>
Waimea's Parker Ranch, the largest family-owned ranch in the United States, 
offers tours. 
</P>
<P>
Spend time in the art gallery of Richard Parker Smart, the ranch's present 
owner. The gallery has a formidable collection of Impressionist paintings and 
Venetian furnishings housed in an 1864 home. You'll find the tour office in 
Waimea's Parker Ranch Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
Ancient Hawaiians carved petroglyphs from the island's lava, and you'll find a 
good number of them in the Puako Petroglyph Fields off Highway 19. These are 
works of human and mythical figures and ancient signs and symbols. 
</P>
<P>
Kohala is the birthplace of Kamehameha the Great, who conquered most of 
Hawaii's islands by the end of the 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Hawaii Visitors Bureau at (213) 385-5301, or 
write to 3440 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 502, Los Angeles 90010 for a brochure on 
the Big Island, two more on accommodations and restaurants. Ask for the Kohala 
package.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rue Antoine Dansaertstraat is two blocks long and in the heart of an old, 
undistinguished, working-class neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But chic, trend-setting shops, with prices that lean toward the high side, are 
making the street one of this city's best for shopping, and are drawing 
customers from other European capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Pyramide Design (No. 10) is Brigitte Burton's shop for fine and unusual home 
furnishings, featuring the work of Belgian and international designers. The 
French-Hungarian designer Martin Szekely's inventive roll-top bookcase ($1,317 
U.S.), a one-of-a-kind, is made of aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
From France there are reproductions of 1934 Art Deco chairs ($135) made of 
silver-colored metal. Other chairs include Japanese designer Shiro Kuramata's 
exotic copper-wire straightbacks, French designer Philippe Stark's nouvelle 
chaises, or elongated armchairs, and Italian designer Kartell's stylish 
stackable chairs in aqua and gray (sold in sets of three at $136 per chair). 
</P>
<P>
Khymo (No. 16) sells Italian-design men's and women's wearables. Women's 
ensembles include Martino Midali's purple cotton-knit trousers ($78), with 
matching purple and black overblouses ($114). 
</P>
<P>
Men's fashions include Marko Alexander's textured knit sweaters ($143) in a 
medley of browns, or see-through knit sweaters in black ($124), as well as 
Grupo Storko's tailored cotton T-shirts in vibrant greens. 
</P>
<P>
Chabada (No. 20) is the choicest fashion shop on the street. The exceptional 
and eclectic collection contains a wide range of Jean-Paul Gaultier, Christian 
Lacroix, Romeo Gigli and other designers. 
</P>
<P>
The racks are filled with Gaultier's eccentric tuxedos ($1,082), Equipment's 
shirts in bold black-and-white checkered patterns ($109), British designer 
David Fielden's pink and black strapless satin gown with a pink rose 
prominently positioned at the bust ($487), plus mechanics' jumperlike jump 
suits by Sybilla and Raysse's sweater and pedal-pusher sets ($102). 
</P>
<P>
Accessories include Christian Lacroix's broad belts ($97 to $146) in purple and 
red suede, plus necklaces ($104), bracelets ($83) made of wood, coconut shell 
chips painted green, and handbags of leather-covered wood that are shaped to 
look like portable electric heaters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Casuals for Men 
</P>
<P>
Stijl, a fashion conglomerate, has three shops on Rue Dansaertstraat. No. 22 
carries extremely modish and mostly casual clothes for men. Women's fashions of 
similar genre are at No. 26. The shop at No. 47 features men's and women's 
underwear. 
</P>
<P>
Black, white and gray tank tops ($14 and up) with one shoulder or wraparound 
straps, and clinging above-the-knee leggings (from $24), can easily double as 
cheeky chic exercise or leisure wear, as can the stylish front-pleated boxer 
shorts (from $30). 
</P>
<P>
Kat (No. 32) has designer clothing for children. Kenzo provides cute 
flower-print dresses ($78) and skirts ($49) for little girls. For dress-up 
occasions, boys can buy houndstooth suits with short pants ($46) and tailored 
jackets ($70). 
</P>
<P>
Olily, a Dutch designer, is represented with three-quarter-length pants ($53) 
in almost-neon colors, and little shoes in equally bright hues. Perfect for 
wearing with the shoes are the shop's selection of socks ($6) featuring 
tick-tack-toe games, heifers at pasture, Halloween pumpkins and maps of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
At Maison Sougne (No. 33) the Vlerick family has been selling "articles de 
peche," or fishing equipment, since 1929. There are lifelike hand-tied flies 
($10 and up) for trout fishing (which happens to be exceptional in Belgium), 
along with flies colored for catching salmon ($3 and up) specifically in 
Alaska, Scotland or Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fishing Equipment 
</P>
<P>
Rods are $15 and up. Signed, split-cane Brunner rods (only 100 a year are 
handmade in Austria) cost about $1,000. Other very special rods are designed 
for fishing for carp or roach, and cost about $250. There are also 
multipocketed jackets, wet-resistant sweaters and waterproof rain slickers, 
plus nets woven of wire ($13). 
</P>
<P>
Robert Clergerie, the Parisian shoemaker extraordinaire, has a boutique at No. 
34. Exceptionally well-made men's footwear is $192 to $207. Women's shoes cost 
$125 to $146. 
</P>
<P>
Crea (No. 53) is a boutique established two years ago by Belgian designers 
Francine Seguin and Jenny Meirens. It includes black knit skirts gathered 
across the hips ($85), matched with black sweat shirts that stop at the waist 
and are topped with a bright red collar ($97). 
</P>
<P>
Big and bulky sweaters in mauve and other lively colors cost $63. The boutique 
also carries Commes des Garcons' funky, asymmetrical outfits and accessories, 
including purple suede boots by Freelance. 
</P>
<P>
Rue Blanche (No. 54) is Belgian designer Marie Regout's showcase for her 
neo-traditional womens' sweaters in fancy knit patterns with pretty lace 
collars (from $75) or big-collared bulky knits ($97 to $250). 
</P>
<P>
Cheerful, smart-looking striped cotton jersey ensembles have skirts and long- 
($70) or short-sleeved ($39) tops. Marie Regout perfected her art while working 
for Scapa for eight years. She's had her own boutique for two years and is 
becoming a well-known name in European shopping capitals and in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mail-Order Tailor 
</P>
<P>
Creation et Freddy Tailor (No. 61) is a fine tailor for custom-made men's and 
women's traditional suits from $500 to $610. The process requires three 
fittings and takes three to four weeks for delivery. However, the shop retains 
all measurements and will take mail-orders for suits. 
</P>
<P>
Chappelle Opticien (No. 65) offers a collection of designer eye-wear, including 
Gaultier's frames with a tightly wound spring across the top of the lenses and 
Robert La Roche's convenient and classy snap-up shades ($241), plus a variety 
of 1930s and 1950s repro glasses priced from $134. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the shop sells corrective lenses for dogs. These pooch specs come in 
three sizes and cost $48. 
</P>
<P>
Ancienne Maison A. Orlans (No. 67-69) is famous for tailoring custom-made suits 
and uniforms for the extensive and well-groomed population of European Economic 
Community personnel and other diplomats stationed in Brussels. The shop, 30 
years old, has an air of unpretentious elegance and refinement. 
</P>
<P>
Suits are entirely handmade, except for pants pockets, of fine English and 
Italian wools, and cost $1,200 and up. Suits made for export are 20% less 
because of the store's on-the-spot tax rebate policy. Customers choose styles 
from up-to-date magazines provided by the shop. Delivery takes five to six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Designer is Ex-Architect 
</P>
<P>
Sanz (No. 71) is owned by Belgian architect-turned-designer Luc Sanz, who sells 
his chic structural clothing along with that of other fine designers. Sanz's 
inventive styles are all made on the premises, in a loft studio that overlooks 
the shop. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the styles are red asymmetrically buttoned shirts with Mao collars 
($109) and one-pocket buttonless shirts slit to the waist ($109), to be worn 
with men's silk harem pants ($182) and fine leather belts with gold-plated 
clasps ($73). 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are ensembles by Miyake and Girbaud, and Spanish designer 
Adolfo Dominguez's unusual, black square-shaped vests ($158) and loose-fitting 
rayon and viscose pleat-front trousers ($134). Aside from the fine clothing, 
Sanz offers chic shopping bags made of corrugated cardboard.

It's been approximately 10 years since I first saw your feature article about 
the Old Monterey Inn. In case you haven't visited 500 Martin Street lately, 
Anne and Gene Swett continue to provide the best aspects of every B&amp;B 
they've ever visited, along with their own amenities. They serve a spectacular 
full breakfast, different each morning. Throughout the day the huge Tudor house 
and gardens are open for reading, lounging or partaking of always-available hot 
and cold beverages. There are teatime cookies, followed by a sherry hour with 
memorable canapes. And the Inn's accommodations are the finest anywhere. Rates 
are from $140 to $195. Thanks for the introduction.

HER WORLD: HERE ARE FEW OF HER FAVORITE THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What I learned on my summer vacation: 
</P>
<P>
The French Polynesian island of Huahine is a good place to live. "We have no 
poison snakes," a native said, "and no poison plants. You can walk barefoot 
anywhere on the island without fear." 
</P>
<P>
The South Island of New Zealand is a good place to live, a native told me. "We 
have no poison snakes," he said, "and no lions either." There is one poison 
spider, he admitted, but you learn to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
The rustic Glacier Bay Country Inn (Box 5, Gustavus, Alaska) is a splendid 
place to stay when you call on Glacier Bay National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Outside are forests of spruce and meadows of wildflowers; inside are log 
ceilings, down comforters and rocking chairs. Innkeepers Annie and Al Unrein 
own this homestead, which is 50 miles west of Juneau. It could be in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The rustic mountain hotel Rosa dos Ventos (at an elevation of 4,000 feet, 
between Teresopolis and Friburgo in Brazil) is a splendid place to retreat from 
the heat and crush of Rio de Janiero. 
</P>
<P>
Outside are lakes, pools and rich stables; inside are log ceilings, a wine 
stube and an enormous hearth. It was originally a private farm. Owner Helenio 
Waddington runs this alpine lodge that's a 90-minute drive west of Rio. It 
could be in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a two-hour car rental on Bora Bora is about $25. That did get me 
around the island with time for photographs and a snack. The price for 24 hours 
is about $38. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite drive on the Big Island of Hawaii is north along the Kohala Coast to 
where the road ends at the Pololu Valley lookout. In the rain, the sheer cliffs 
could be Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to live in the last frame house on the right -- the one with the 
battered fence and the yapping dog and the wide porch that faces the sea. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite drive in Northern California is west from Glen Ellen (home of a 
pleasant Sauvignon Blanc as well as the writer Jack London, whose ranch is now 
a state park) toward the small town of Cotati. 
</P>
<P>
From California 12 north of historic Sonoma you turn on Warm Springs Road and 
meander up a hillside of vast oaks, madronas and redwoods. It is a 
shade-dappled lane. Old farms and vineyards spill off to left and right as you 
climb narrow Sonoma Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the wooded crest, turn left on Pressley Road and you will be on your way 
to Petaluma and the highway south to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Finland has 187,833 lakes, according to a recent count. "We always said we were 
a land of 60,000 lakes, and we hoped that was not too much of an exaggeration," 
a Finnish woman said. "This year the government made an official count and 
found we have three times that many -- although some, I admit, are small." 
</P>
<P>
The hot, sultry temperature in Singapore, that island so close to the Equator, 
varies only a few degrees from day to night and from what elsewhere is called 
winter and summer. The seasons are the months of monsoons (November to January) 
and those of occasional showers (February to October). 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing about our climate," a Singapore banker said, "is that it is 
absolutely predictable. Travelers like that. It makes packing easy." 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I like a little surprise in my travels. Especially if it comes as a 
cool breeze on a warm day.

CONSUMER REPORT: AIRLINES OFTEN WILL REACT TO LETTERS OF COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER, Adler is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does it pay to complain to an airline about poor service, or lack of it, or 
about any other misadventures? 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, yes. 
</P>
<P>
"We received many letters from passengers on the subject of waiving 
advance-purchase conditions on discount fares in emergency situations," a 
United Airlines spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a general policy on this issue that allowed our local personnel, on a 
case-by-case basis, to waive these conditions and let people fly for less 
money. But the policy wasn't always implemented the same way and on the same 
level of authority." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of consumer letters, United is deciding these hardship cases on an 
individual basis, but requests are automatically sent to a local supervisor for 
a decision. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a Los Angeles man and his wife contacted a major U.S. carrier 
about his treatment at the Miami airport. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to fly from Miami to Antigua, their flight was canceled. They were 
told there would be no more flights to Antigua from Miami that day on any 
airline, and to return the following day. 
</P>
<P>
They discovered that another airline did have a flight from Miami to Antigua 
that same day, so they had themselves rerouted on it. 
</P>
<P>
On returning to Los Angeles the man wrote to the airline of the original 
reservation. He received an apology for the behavior of the airline's ground 
personnel and the official criticized his own ground people's failure to make 
alternative flight arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
The letter also indicated that the employees working that flight had been 
"counseled," and would not make that mistake again. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the letter writer received two vouchers worth $250 for use on the 
airline's domestic destinations. 
</P>
<P>
Although not all the letters are expected to bring a comparable response, it is 
usually worth informing the airlines of questionable incidents. Even if you 
don't get the response you would like, your letter may generate beneficial 
results for all passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"We code each customer letter and track complaints on a weekly basis, looking 
for trends," the United spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Letters to United also have led to more personnel training in handling customer 
problems at point of contact, and have led to more authority given to 
first-line employees who have to resolve the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"We maintain statistics on complaints, which are relayed to pertinent 
department heads for possible action. Virtually all letters from passengers are 
carefully read and acknowledged. Some letters only describe an experience 
without asking for anything," the TWA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you don't want a response, TWA still wants your letter. "Passengers who 
aren't happy about something should write even if they don't expect an answer 
or aren't asking for some sort of action. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd also like to hear about positive experiences," the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
When you do wish to complain, your letter should meet three basic conditions: 
Be clear as to what happened, detail what response you wish and document your 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
But writers should be reasonable when seeking compensation, the TWA spokesman 
said. "For example, we get letters from passengers complaining about bad meals 
and wanting credit for another flight. These complaints may have validity, but 
a free trip is out of proportion to the situation. After all, the passenger 
still got the transportation, which is the basic value involved." 
</P>
<P>
Documentation should cover tickets, baggage receipts and itemization of 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, airline adjustments (you'll need to establish a good case) might 
include monetary compensation or vouchers for other flights. 
</P>
<P>
You can take your problems to the U.S. Department of Transportation, but first 
you should contact your carrier. If you're unsatisfied with the response or 
don't get one, then contact the department. 
</P>
<P>
Areas of consumer protection covered by DOT rules are domestic baggage 
liability, overbooking/denied boarding compensation, seats in a nonsmoking area 
and charters. 
</P>
<P>
Canceled, delayed or diverted flights represent a general area in which the 
department may not be able to provide assistance. Fares and flight services (or 
lack of them) are other categories in which the U.S. Department of 
Transportation may not be able to help. 
</P>
<P>
However, fare advertising is another matter. If you think an ad is misleading 
or deceptive, let the DOT know. 
</P>
<P>
Even though your complaint might be one the department can't respond to, 
information is still used in the agency's statistics on airline performance. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Transportation does ensure that an airline follows 
regulations. However, if there are no rules and the issue is a matter of 
airline policy, the passenger must pursue other steps, which can include 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The department also won't get involved in negotiations between passengers and 
airlines. While the agency might ask an airline what actions it had taken to 
find missing baggage (or to settle a claim about such luggage), it wouldn't 
intervene in determining the value of the case's contents. 
</P>
<P>
Call the U.S. Department of Transportation at (202) 366-2220. If you phone 
after 2 p.m. or on weekends, you'll hear a taped message that asks for your 
name and phone number. 
</P>
<P>
Review your complaint before making a call to the DOT, and have documents 
handy. Be able to relay the problems precisely and clearly. 
</P>
<P>
You can write (printed letters are preferred) to the Office of Consumer 
Affairs, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 7th St. S.W., Washington, D.C. 
20590.

of the City of Science and Industry at La Vilette. Versailles was fourth and 
the Louvre fifth.

In an effort to preserve the environment, especially within its national parks 
and reserves, the government of Botswana has dramatically raised user fees for 
unescorted visitors to the parks. The per-person fees have increased from $1.50 
a day to $25, plus $10 a night for camp fees and a $5-per-day vehicle charge. 
</P>
<P>
The move is an attempt to encourage travelers to take tours that use 
established campgrounds and lodges, and to discourage the independent travelers 
-- mostly from neighboring South Africa. Those on escorted tours using a 
licensed operator will be charged a flat $15 a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Botswana government believes unescorted travelers to such regions as the 
Okavango Delta and Kalahari Desert are far less responsible to the environment 
than tourists who are under the supervision of a trained guide or park ranger.

A CASE FOR LIVING IN A CONDO AND LOVING IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE EBERTS, Eberts is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Try turning the lunchroom conversation to condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Your co-workers will probably describe condos as the mini-malls of housing: 
cheaply built, mind-numbingly repetitive structures forced upon unlucky 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Folks who live in condos are socially respectable only if they hate living 
there and swear they're devoting their lives to "trading up" to a single-family 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who lives in a condo and actually likes it is perceived as a Joe Isuzu 
sort of character who fears yard work would cost him time better spent cruising 
singles bars. 
</P>
<P>
About now, Biff, that bright young junior bookkeeper the boss likes so much, 
will chime in that he and the missus just bought a brand-new house in Tiffany 
Estates or Monte Carlo Villas or some such thing, which means it's sitting in 
the desert behind a mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Traditional Choice 
</P>
<P>
Sure the commute to downtown is long, Biff admits. But getting up at 4:30 a.m. 
can be rather pleasant, especially since his wife, Buffy, and a lot of their 
neighbors are up getting ready to go to their jobs too. 
</P>
<P>
Buffy and Biff made a traditional, and many would say wise, choice. On their 
combined annual salary of, say, $50,000, they probably felt they had few 
housing options. 
</P>
<P>
Houses in their price range in established suburban areas like the San Fernando 
Valley were probably "fixers" or otherwise distressed properties and were 
likely to be in unappealing neighborhoods. By comparison, that new, 
1,500-square foot home in the desert looked good. 
</P>
<P>
Maria and Mike -- my wife and I -- spent the first half of 1988 looking for a 
home and, coincidentally, have about the same income as Biff and Buffy. Like 
them, we're a 30-ish couple planning a small family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
We Bought a Neighborhood 
</P>
<P>
In fact, we bought at about the same time and spent the same amount of money 
for a home. But we're different from Biff and Buffy in one respect: We live in 
a condo. And we like it. And we plan to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Biff and Buffy bought a house. We bought a neighborhood. Biff and Buffy were 
priced out of the neighborhoods their parents live in. We live in the 
neighborhood my parents were priced out of. We live in Los Feliz. 
</P>
<P>
Our third-floor, 1,450-square foot condo has two bedrooms and a loft, a large 
balcony, a 19-foot living room ceiling and lovely views of the Silver Lake 
hills and the Griffith Park Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
Our 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage payment, $938 a month, is no problem. I work 
full time but, being a teacher, have the summer off. I feel no need to scramble 
for summer employment. My wife works part time and goes to graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
During the school year, I commute to work by bicycle, which I've estimated 
saves me about $3,000 a year in car-related costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Park as Back Yard 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood has become our front yard. Increasingly, we seem to be walking 
to the supermarket, the florist or the drugstore. Sometimes after dinner we 
just stroll around the neighborhood with no particular destination, admiring 
the architecture and the hills. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Park has become our 4,000-acre back yard. I hike there with the Sierra 
Club and cycle with the Los Angeles Wheelmen. Including visits to the 
observatory, the L.A. Zoo and the other facilities, I set foot in Griffith Park 
about 300 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
Our "yard work" is also neighborhood-based. We belong to the Los Feliz 
Improvement Assn., the local homeowner group, and the Greater Los Angeles Zoo 
Assn. Maria is vice president of our building's board of directors. And I 
recently completed an earthquake preparedness course with about 35 of our 
neighbors. We hope to keep the neighborhood functioning in the uncertain days 
after "The Big One." 
</P>
<P>
If Maria and I had wanted to, we could have bought on the Westside, Pasadena, 
anywhere in the Valley. We were free to live almost anywhere we wanted to -- 
except for perhaps on the beach at Malibu or in deepest Beverly Hills -- simply 
because we agreed to live in a condo. 
</P>
<P>
Condo living provides moderate-income people in Southern California a freedom 
they haven't had in years, maybe decades: living where you want to rather than 
where you can afford. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little House Below 
</P>
<P>
I'll give you an idea how impossible housing prices are for regular folks in my 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 feet below our living room window sits a little stucco box of a house. 
It was built in the '20s, has three bedrooms, one bath and about 1,500 square 
feet. It has no yard to speak of: a tiny fringe of grass in the front (maybe 
enough to pitch a small tent on) and a back yard that consists of a concrete 
driveway and a shed. Inside, the rooms are little and dark. However, the house 
has been nicely reconditioned. The asking price: $349,000. 
</P>
<P>
All right, so it won't sell for the asking price, but I think it will go for at 
least $300,000. Let's say Maria and I were playing by the traditional rules and 
viewed this as a starter house (You wouldn't want to spend your life in that 
cracker box, believe me.) 
</P>
<P>
Let's say that we came up with 10% down and after closing costs had a mortgage 
of $275,000 for 30 years at a fixed 10.5%. If we somehow qualified for such a 
loan (obviously an S&amp;L destined to be seized by the feds), the monthly 
payment would come to $2,515.54. 
</P>
<P>
My life and Maria's would be thrown into complete disarray. My teaching 
take-home pay is a little over $2,300 -- and I only get checks 10 months a 
year. I'd have to teach a heck of a lot of extra classes, plus summer school -- 
or maybe get a new career (which I don't want). My wife would have no hope of 
going to graduate school and instead would have to work full time and then 
some. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working Years of Overtime 
</P>
<P>
Ok, after five years or so, inflation would lighten our load, but meantime we'd 
be getting tired of a front lawn you can mow with scissors and a living room 
reminiscent of the Bat Cave and decide to trade up. Sure, the down payment 
would be no problem, but we would also be trading up to an even bigger 
mortgage. So back we'd go, both working more years of overtime (providing we 
could get it). 
</P>
<P>
We'd rather have a life. 
</P>
<P>
Biff would tell you about the modern 1,500-square-foot house that he bought in 
May, 1988 for $142,500. He'd tell you that his neighborhood is pleasant because 
it is new and clean and relatively uncrowded and will be a good place to raise 
kids. And if he needs to go 40 or 60 or 80 miles to work, well, hey, that's 
what cars are for. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if Biff and Buffy like desert/suburban living and work reasonably nearby, 
I think they've made a good choice. But if they're making a two-hour commute 
into L.A., they're working more overtime than Maria and I would be if we had 
bought the $300,000 house. 
</P>
<P>
Think about it. Two hours each way five times a week is 20 hours -- half a 
standard workweek. For a lot of the year, that means leaving before dawn and 
getting home after sundown. Or, for the first eight or so years of a child's 
life, leaving before he or she is up and getting home after bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
And let's have a moment of silence to mull over what this is doing to our air 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Priced Out of Area 
</P>
<P>
As for raising our kids, I'm sure there will be days when Maria and I will wish 
we had our own yard. But I also remember that when I got older and my parents, 
priced out of East Hollywood (not to mention Los Feliz), moved us out to a 
little tract house in the Valley, losing the neighborhood, and especially 
losing Griffith Park, was a far larger loss than the yard was a gain. 
</P>
<P>
So just as Biff is destined to spend a major part of his life in traffic 
calling in accident reports to news radio on his car phone so that his kid can 
climb the plum tree in the back yard, I have my own neighborhood-based version 
of the dream. 
</P>
<P>
My destiny, I guess, is to ride home from work on my bicycle dodging guys 
talking on car phones. I won't have my own tree, but on warm summer nights 
Maria and I can take our kid up the hill to the observatory and look out over 
the seemingly infinite cityscape. 
</P>
<P>
"See that long street right below us? That's Normandie Avenue, where your dad 
grew up," I'll say. "That hill on the left is Silver Lake, where your 
great-grandmother lived. A little farther is Belmont High, where your 
grandfather was captain of the baseball team. And right below, just outside the 
park, is where we live. 
</P>
<P>
"That's our home." 
</P>

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: RENT SEEMS CHEAP BUT IN LONG RUN IT COSTS MORE THAN 
BUYING A HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Almost every week you tell people to buy their first home and build 
some equity in it for a few years so they can sell it and buy a more desirable 
home. That's hogwash. 
</P>
<P>
Why should I sweat and strain to make the mortgage payments on a home I don't 
like, so I might someday buy a nicer home that probably won't be much better? I 
think renting makes much more sense. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the town where I live I can rent a very nice home for around 
$1,000 per month. If I buy that same typical home I will need a down payment of 
at least $25,000 cash and my monthly payment will be around $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
As for not getting the tax deductions, it doesn't make any sense to pay out 
$2,000 to get a $2,000 tax deduction, which saves me only $560 in federal 
income taxes. Isn't it time you stop telling your readers to buy a first home? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: No. About two-thirds of American households own their home. The other 
one-third are renters because they can't afford to buy a home, they don't want 
to buy a home or they want to buy a home but plan to move within a few years, 
so renting makes more sense. 
</P>
<P>
To show what can happen if you don't buy your own home, let me tell you about 
some renter friends who have rented the same two-bedroom apartment for over 35 
years. They are now in their 70s and are retired on a meager pension and social 
security. For 35 years they have wasted money paying rent and have nothing to 
show for it but a pile of worthless rent receipts. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason they can still afford the rent is that their apartment is under 
rent control and the landlord subsidizes their low rent. However, if the 
building is sold and the new owner wants to live in their apartment, they could 
be forced to move out. Unfortunately, they have little savings and no equity 
cushion as they would have if they instead had bought a home when they were 
young. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually everyone who buys their first home has to stretch their budget. A 
home purchase not only creates a place to live but a forced savings account. I 
recall lying awake the first night in my current home, about 10 years ago, 
worrying about how I would make the mortgage payments. But somehow I made every 
payment, and today have built a substantial equity, mostly due to the home's 
appreciation in market value due to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, on an out-of-pocket basis renting is cheaper than owning a home. But in 
the long run, renting is far more expensive than owning a home because renters 
build no equity and can't look forward to the day when their payments stop. 
</P>
<P>
Few of us spend our lifetimes living in the first home we buy. But the 
important thing is our first home, no matter how humble, gets us started 
building equity, so, if we wish, we can move up to a nicer home. That's what 
the American home ownership dream is all about. 
</P>
<P>
Exemption Can't Be Used on Two Homes 
</P>
<P>
Q: We plan to sell our home, which has greatly appreciated in market value 
since we bought it 12 years ago. However, we plan to move to Florida where 
homes are much less expensive. If we also buy a vacation home, probably in 
northern Michigan, and the total prices of the two homes exceed our old home's 
sales price can we avoid paying profit tax? 
</P>
<P>
A: Nice try, but your plan won't work. Since you didn't mention anything about 
being 55 or older, I assume you are not eligible for the $125,000 "over 55 
rule" home sale tax exemption. 
</P>
<P>
The "rollover residence replacement rule" of IRC 1034 says you must defer your 
home sale profit tax if you buy a replacement principal residence of equal or 
greater cost within 24 months before or after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Please notice the rule says "a replacement principal residence." Two residences 
won't qualify because you can have only one replacement principal residence. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, if you buy a less expensive replacement home, your profit will be 
taxed on the difference in the two prices. To illustrate, suppose you sell your 
old home for a $300,000 net sales price and buy a Florida mansion for $200,000. 
The tax result is up to $100,000 of your home sale profit is taxable. Please 
consult your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
Choose Best Agent, Not Just the Franchise 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I are debating which real estate agent should get our listing 
to sell our home. We have narrowed the choice to two agents. One woman has been 
"farming" our neighborhood for about five years. She is very successful. But 
she works for a local, independent brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
The other agent, who admits he is new to the business with about six months 
sales experience, works for a franchised realty office that advertises very 
heavily on TV and in the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Both agents have their pros and cons. As you often suggest, we phoned their 
references of previous sellers and the woman came out with the best 
recommendations from former clients. However, the new agent's firm has a 
relocation program that helped a friend buy her home a few months ago. Which 
agent should get our listing? 
</P>
<P>
A: Please make your choice by hiring the best agent. No matter how famous the 
franchised name or how many ads you see, the real estate sales business depends 
on the quality of each agent. That's how the independent brokerage firms can 
compete with the big name franchise offices. 
</P>
<P>
If the female agent has been very successful selling homes in your area and has 
good recommendations, don't hold her lack of a big name franchise company 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
Although the man admits he is new, that drawback shouldn't count against him if 
he is energetic and has good client references. However, I hope you won't place 
much weight on his firm's franchised name because that name doesn't sell homes 
because most offices are locally owned and operated. While relocation programs 
are important, they rarely result in direct in-house sales, so don't put too 
much faith in that benefit. 
</P>
<P>
If you expect me to make your choice for you, I hate to disappoint you, but I 
can only give you the guidelines above. My final suggestion is don't sign a 
long listing. Ask what the average home sales time is in your community and 
list your home only for that period, such as 30 or 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
If the agent refuses to accept anything less than a 90- or 180-day listing, in 
my opinion that agent is not very confident of their abilities. Personally, I 
use 30-day listings with the understanding if the home is unsold when the 
listing expires, I will renew the listing if the agent is doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
Warning to Buyers About 'Fisbos' 
</P>
<P>
Q: As a public service you should warn home buyers to be especially careful 
when buying from "fisbos" (homes for sale by owners). We bought our home from a 
nice old couple who were too cheap to hire a realty agent. Although we thought 
we were buying a bargain, we quickly learned the sellers got the best of us. 
</P>
<P>
If we had purchased through a reputable realty agent, I'm sure the agent would 
have pointed out the house defects that the sellers failed to disclose, such as 
leaky gutters, defective wiring, rotted porch posts and sagging roof. Next time 
we buy a home, you can be sure we will use a reputable realty agent and insist 
on a professional inspection of the house. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thank you for emphasizing the pitfalls of buying directly from the seller 
without the benefit of a professional real estate agent. I have purchased 
several houses direct from owners and I share your experience that 
do-it-yourself home sellers are not the world's most honest people. 
</P>
<P>
Rescission Is Remedy for Misrepresentation 
</P>
<P>
Q: When my husband and I bought our home the realty agent said my husband could 
run his insurance agency from the front living room. The house is on a busy 
street where there are several other small businesses such as a beauty shop, 
antique store and real estate brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
However, when my husband hung out his insurance agency sign, the next week a 
city building inspector informed him the zoning does not allow business use. We 
applied for a variance, but the city refused to approve it. The existing 
businesses have been there many years and are "grandfathered." 
</P>
<P>
A major reason we paid so much for the house was my husband's plan to use the 
front room for his insurance business. He had to rent a business office that 
costs more than $1,000 per month. When we called the realty agent, she claimed 
she didn't know we couldn't use the house for a business. Can we get our money 
back? 
</P>
<P>
A: When a property is misrepresented by the seller or realty agent, one legal 
remedy is rescission of the sale. Another possible remedy is monetary damages, 
but they could be very difficult to prove. Rescission means you would be 
refunded the sales price, minus the fair market rental value of the property. 
Please consult a real estate attorney for details. 
</P>
<P>
Move Fence or Lose Ground to Easement 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several years ago our neighbor built a fence where we thought the property 
line was located. However, we recently had a survey made as we plan to build a 
room addition. It showed the fence is about 4 feet on our side of the property 
line. When I talked to the neighbor, she said she can't afford to have the 
fence moved. What should we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Unless the fence is moved, your neighbor could acquire a prescriptive 
easement to that 4-foot strip of your land, thus decreasing the value of your 
property. Open, notorious, hostile and continuous use can result in your 
neighbor becoming entitled to permanent use of that land strip. To avoid this 
unpleasant result, since your neighbor refuses to move the fence, consult a 
real estate attorney about legal action. 
</P>
<P>
Divorce Isn't Reason to Stop Home Sale 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I signed a contract to sell our home. About a week later my wife 
said she wanted a divorce. This greatly upset both of us. We decided it would 
be best not to sell the house. But the buyers refuse to cancel the sale and 
have sued us for specific performance of the sales contract. Since my wife will 
need to keep the house to raise our three children, can the court stop the 
sale? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you and your wife signed a valid real estate sales contract, the buyer is 
entitled to enforce it by suing for specific performance of the agreement. In 
addition, the buyer can record a lis pendens against the title to prevent you 
from selling to someone else. Please consult your attorney for more details. 
</P>
<P>
Realty Agent Favors Using Open Listings 
</P>
<P>
Q: I strongly disagree with you. You recently said, "an open listing is no 
listing at all." For the last 22 years I have earned a very substantial income 
as a real estate broker specializing only in open listings. I sell all types of 
properties from single-family homes to commercial buildings to raw land, all on 
open listings. 
</P>
<P>
The reason owners like open listings is because they don't feel under any 
pressure when they work with me. Sometimes I sell a property within a few 
weeks. Once it took me two years to sell a property. But I think you are wrong 
to tell property owners to use exclusive listings. Open listings are best for 
sellers and for realty agents. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thousands of real estate agents will disagree with you because most agents 
prefer exclusive listings, which give them maximum control over the property. 
Whether the agent or the seller finds a buyer, an exclusive right to sell 
listing entitles the agent to a full sales commission. 
</P>
<P>
Why Lease-Option Is Better Than Buying 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several times you have recommended lease-options as a good way to acquire a 
home. But I don't understand why I would be worse off to buy a home than to 
lease it with an option to buy. Please explain. 
</P>
<P>
A: I didn't say that. But I did suggest leasing a home with an option to buy is 
the best way to acquire control without the costs of buying the house. 
Lease-options can be especially profitable if you plan to occupy a home just 
for a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Let me illustrate. About three years ago a real estate agent presented me with 
the following lease-option: The homeowner wanted me to pay all expenses of the 
home plus $500 net rent to him every month, with a year's rent in advance. In 
return, he would give me an option to buy the house at its then current market 
value. The realty agent wanted $3,000 immediate commission plus an additional 
$3,000 commission when and if I exercise the option. 
</P>
<P>
Since I could rent the house for a break-even cash flow, that sounded like a 
fair deal to me. I asked for a 15-year lease-option term and the owner agreed. 
Of course, I was anticipating the house just might go up in value during the 
next 15 years. But the owner is very happy receiving his $500 per month rent 
without any worries. In fact, I send him a year's post-dated checks just to be 
sure he receives the $500 rent on time every month. 
</P>
<P>
However, I receive no tax benefits from this lease-option. The owner continues 
to deduct the mortgage interest, property taxes and depreciation. I can only 
deduct the operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
You can be in a similar situation by lease-optioning a house. Even if you 
decide not to exercise the purchase option, be sure the option is assignable, 
so you can sell it at a profit. Of course, the longer the option term, the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Where to Find Tax Sale of Properties 
</P>
<P>
Q: I saw on late-night cable TV where a fellow bought real estate at bargain 
prices at a county tax sale. How can I find out details on these tax sales? 
</P>
<P>
A: Just phone or visit your county tax collector's office for information on 
the next tax sale of properties where the owners have not paid the real estate 
taxes. Most counties hold one or two of these sales each year. The rules are 
different in each state and, sometimes, in each county. 
</P>
<P>
My experience is these sales usually involve odd vacant land parcels, but 
occasionally a property with a nice house or other improvements on it will be 
offered for sale. 
</P>
<P>
When you obtain the list of properties to be sold, try to contact the owners of 
the parcels that interest you and buy from them a few days before the sale. 
Then rush to the tax collector's office and pay the unpaid property taxes to 
stop the sale. If you can't find the owner, then you will have to bid 
competitively at the tax sale. 
</P>
<P>
Who Would Choose an Adjustable-Rate Loan? 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I recently bought our first home. We got a fixed-rate mortgage 
at just under 10% interest. The same lender also had adjustable rate mortgages 
at 9.5% after an initial "teaser rate" of 8.85% for three months. We decided 
the fixed-rate loan was best. Do you think we made the right choice? Why would 
anyone choose an adjustable rate mortgage? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages should be about 2% 
below fixed rate loans to compensate for shifting the risk of rising interest 
rates to borrowers. Current adjustable rate mortgage interest rates are too 
high because the indexes are too high in relation to long-term interest rates. 
The result is most home loan borrowers select fixed rate loans, as you wisely 
did.

'CUTE' HOME REMODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read about Eileen Heyes' flightly waltz into home remodeling and wish to 
point out numerous mistakes she appears to be making: 
</P>
<P>
1. Her attitude toward this project is not businesslike. This is not a game. 
This is probably the primary source of her net worth. 
</P>
<P>
2. She apparently chose an architect that does not share her aesthetics. Hence, 
she finds herself in "tense negotiations" with him. Prior to choosing an 
architect, she should have had some concepts of design and style down pat, and 
should've determined whether a prospective architect could guide her through 
rather than fight her through the final design and construction drawing phase. 
</P>
<P>
3. She is paying too much for the bathtub. There are a number of ways to buy 
products for the bath. She apparently chose the method of purchase whereby you 
buy retail one item at a time. Frankly, this is the costliest way. She could 
have grouped her entire bathroom fixtures purchase and saved a considerable sum 
by buying direct (which would have taken a bit of work). 
</P>
<P>
4. Why "skip the math" regarding the financing? Obtaining the appropriate 
financing (as well as determining the amount to finance) is a critical part of 
the remodeling decision. Why did she take out a second and turn around soon 
thereafter and take out an all-inclusive jumbo loan for $250,000? 
</P>
<P>
It appears that she presents a profile of what not to do when remodeling. No 
doubt, before she is through, she will have spent top dollar or more for every 
aspect of her project.

ELUSIVE FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a would-be first-time home buyer, I found the article, "Buying FHA" by 
William Mahoney (Aug. 27) to be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing I noticed is that the people who were quoted in the article 
bought their homes two years ago for below the $101,250 FHA limit. Even a condo 
at that low a price is hard to find these days. 
</P>
<P>
These young couples may have been able to buy these homes for $5,000 to $8,000 
cash two years ago, but if a couple such as my husband and myself were to try 
to buy a condo at, say $128,000 instead of the $95,000, it would cost a great 
deal more in cash than the amounts quoted in the article. 
</P>
<P>
With rents rising unchecked (in most areas, all that is required is a 30-day 
notice, and there is no limit on the amount rents can be raised), it is 
improbable that most young couples will be able to save the large amounts that 
are necessary to buy any property in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
If we moved to a cheaper apartment and sacrificed everything, we might be able 
to save $10,000 in a year or so. By then, the price of the average condo will 
have risen $20,000 to $30,000 (or more), and we still won't have enough saved. 
As long as housing prices keep rising at the rate they have been, young people 
with average incomes will not be able to save the money necessary to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Most young, two-income couples like us are in the 28% tax bracket. We are 
paying anywhere from one-third to one-half of our net income to ever-increasing 
rents, and our pay does not keep up with inflation. How are we supposed to save 
up the thousands of dollars necessary to purchase a home?

THE SMALL INVESTOR: GUIDELINES FOR BUYING REAL ESTATE FOR PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: As a longtime homeowner and recent realty investor, I look forward to 
your sage advice. What are your guidelines for buying investment properties? 
Currently I own two rental houses but am considering buying apartments and 
maybe commercial buildings. What do you think of land investments? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: My basic guidelines for buying investment property include buy "fixer 
property," which will go up in value $2 for each $1 you spend on improvements; 
make as small a cash down payment as possible to get the best terms and obtain 
seller financing; buy properties in locations that you expect will appreciate 
in market value, and aim for at least break-even cash flow from rentals. 
</P>
<P>
This last guideline is hard to meet on rental houses but I don't mind a little 
negative cash flow if the residence is appreciating nicely in market value. 
</P>
<P>
The profit on rental houses usually comes from the resale , whereas profits 
from apartments and commercial buildings come from net operating income and, 
hopefully, resale profit, too. 
</P>
<P>
I do not recommend investing in vacant land because it is very difficult to 
finance and usually requires a large down payment, usually produces little or 
no income and may never appreciate in market value. I prefer improved property, 
especially well-located but run-down property that can be upgraded for 
immediate increase in market value. 
</P>
<P>
Use 'Lemonade' to Get Rid of Sour Deal 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please help me. I recently inherited a one-sixth partnership share in an 
apartment building. The estate executor tells me it is worth about $200,000. 
But the other five partners do not want to sell the building, which produces a 
nice cash flow. I have tried to sell my share to the other partners but the 
best I can get requires a 20% discount. I want to use the money to buy a nice 
home. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: As you have discovered, there is virtually no market for a one-sixth share 
of an apartment building partnership. But that $160,000 offer for a $200,000 
partnership share is very good. You might reconsider accepting it. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative is to offer to trade the partnership share as all or part 
of your down payment on the home you want to buy. Many home sellers would love 
such a big down payment, especially since it produces a good cash flow. But you 
may have to sweeten your offer with a little cash, especially to pay the realty 
agent's sales commission. This technique is called "lemonading." 
</P>
<P>
Does It Matter to Be Realty Dealer? 
</P>
<P>
Q: As an investor, I frequently buy and sell properties. I recall years ago it 
used to be important to avoid being called a "real estate dealer." Since the 
capital gains and ordinary income tax rates are now the same, does it matter 
anymore? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Although I haven't heard of the IRS arguing much about dealer status 
lately for very active realty investors who frequently buy and sell properties, 
if you are declared to be a dealer then you would become ineligible for 
depreciation of your properties and for tax-deferred exchanges. Those are the 
two major disadvantages of being a realty dealer. Consult your CPA for further 
details. 
</P>
<P>
Be on Guard Against Property Milker 
</P>
<P>
Q: About a year ago, we sold our apartment building and carried back a $225,000 
second mortgage. All went well for about six months. Then our mortgage payments 
stopped coming in. When I contacted the buyer, she said the building was 
suffering high vacancies and she couldn't afford to pay us. 
</P>
<P>
But I drove by the building and didn't see any vacancy sign. I phoned some of 
my old tenants who still live there. They said the new owner has cut back on 
maintenance and the building is going downhill rapidly. As far as they knew, 
the apartments are all full. What can I do to get my money? 
</P>
<P>
A: The new owner is obviously milking your former building by keeping the 
rental income and failing to pay the expenses. Check with the first-mortgage 
lender to see if payments are being made. If not, to prevent the first lender 
from foreclosing and wiping out your second mortgage, your best protection is 
to immediately begin foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
You may also be able to get a receiver appointed by the court to collect the 
rents, operate the building and pay the expenses. You may already have waited 
too long to consult a real estate attorney to start foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Negligent Agent Is Liable for Thefts 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live out of town and a local realty agent manages four rental houses for 
me. When one was vacant, the agent gave the key to a prospective renter who 
came to his office. The key was never returned. The next day the agent went to 
the house and found it stripped of the appliances, new carpets, water heater 
and even some of the light fixtures. The cost of restoring the house will be 
about $4,000. Do you think the realty agent should pay? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The realty agent who manages your houses appears to have been grossly 
negligent for giving out the key to a prospective renter without accompanying 
him or at least taking identification, such as a copy of the prospect's 
driver's license and holding some credit cards as security. Since the agent 
breached his fiduciary duty to you, the agent should pay for your loss. 
</P>
<P>
Be Prepared for IRS Tax-Deferral Challenge 
</P>
<P>
Q: About a year ago, we tried to sell our home but were unable to do so because 
of local economic conditions. So we rented the house. Now we want to sell as 
the market has improved considerably. Will we be able to defer the tax on our 
sale profit which we expect will be about $30,000? 
</P>
<P>
A: Probably. As you surely know, Internal Revenue Code 1034 allows you to defer 
your home sale tax when selling your principal residence if you buy a 
replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost within 24 months 
before or after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
However, this law does not say if a temporary rental due to local economic 
conditions will disqualify the tax deferral. But a Tax Court decision (Clapham 
63 T.C. 505, 1975) allowed tax deferral in similar circumstances where the 
seller took three years to sell his former residence which he rented in the 
interim. 
</P>
<P>
If you claim tax deferral be prepared for an IRS challenge which you may 
successfully meet. Please consult your tax adviser for full details. 
</P>
<P>
What Is Break-Even Point for Commercial? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am considering buying a mixed-use commercial and residential property. The 
apartments are 95% full. But the commercial space is about 35% vacant, due to 
absentee management. The seller is offering the property at eight times gross 
income. Do you think this is a good buy? 
</P>
<P>
A: Never, never, never buy income property based on its gross rent multiplier. 
The reason is the gross multiplier does not consider the operating expenses and 
debt service. The gross multiplier method of pricing income properties is used 
by sellers who hope an inexperienced buyer will overpay for the investment. 
</P>
<P>
Since the property has a very high vacancy factor, one approach to evaluating 
it is to consider its break-even point. Based on realistic rents, not the 
seller's projections which are probably far too high, calculate what rental 
income is needed to break-even with operating expenses. Then evaluate the 
probability of attaining at least the break-even point within six months. 
</P>
<P>
Presuming the property is well-located and in basically sound condition, 
another approach to evaluating income property is to capitalize its net income. 
Be sure to include a realistic vacancy estimate. Use a capitalization rate for 
the net operating income (excluding depreciation and mortgage payments) based 
on recent sales prices of comparable nearby income properties. 
</P>
<P>
Resale Market Slim for Partnerships 
</P>
<P>
Q: Just before the 1986 Tax Reform Act, I invested $40,000 in a small real 
estate limited partnership syndication of 12 investors. The property is doing 
quite well and provides nice cash flow of about 12% annually. 
</P>
<P>
However, the other investors have no intent of selling the building any time 
soon. But I want to sell my share. I offered it to all the other investors and 
they will pay me only a small fraction of my investment. I contacted Liquidity 
Fund in Emeryville, Calif., which you recommended some time ago but they are 
not interested. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
A: One way to get rid of your limited partnership share is to offer it as all 
or part of your down payment on real estate you may want to buy. But you may 
have to sweeten your purchase offer with a little cash. However, be sure to 
first consult your tax adviser about the tax consequences of such an offer.

HERE'S THE REAL DIRT ABOUT ORDERING TOPSOIL; 
</P>
<P>
OFTEN WHAT'S NEEDED ARE AMENDMENTS TO IMPROVE WHAT'S IN YOUR GARDEN NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, Times Garden Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who do you call when you need good dirt? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you are sick to death of your garden and the fact that nothing will grow, 
and you think this is the solution. 
</P>
<P>
Well, most people look under "Topsoil" in the classified pages of the phone 
book, but topsoil is a much-abused word. It can mean just about anything -- 
some horrible soil that someone else wanted to get rid of or the heavy clay 
excavated for a swimming pool or (the best possible scenario) a wonderful, 
weed-free, sandy loam that is a joy to dig in. 
</P>
<P>
Soil amendments, such as peat moss, ground bark or shavings, are also called 
"topsoil," and are often sold by the same outfits. Although they are anything 
but topsoils, these soil amendments are really what you want. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I ask anyone who calls is, 'Do you need to raise the level of 
the soil?' " said Jeff Van Ess of Lewis Topsoil in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have to make a part of the garden higher, to fill low ground or to 
fill planter boxes or raised beds . . . is the only time you really need 
topsoil. The rest of the time what the caller really wants is a soil 
amendment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Both Cost Same 
</P>
<P>
What's the difference? It's really very simple, but a lot of homeowners don't 
get it: Topsoil is just that -- dirt scooped from the ground. Soil amendments 
are organic or chemical products that improve dirt -- make it softer or help it 
hold water. 
</P>
<P>
There is no difference price-wise if you are buying good topsoil or amendments. 
Both cost about $30 a cubic yard, plus a delivery charge if you are not near 
their point of origin. 
</P>
<P>
The best true topsoil is a sandy loam and a reputable topsoil company will 
provide topsoil that has been ground up and pulverized in a machine so there 
are no chunks, and they will remove the rocks. They also make sure the soil is 
weed-free. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely what kind of amendment or topsoil you need depends. 
</P>
<P>
"We always ask what their soil is like and what they are going to plant," said 
Bernie White of White Topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hold Water, Fertilizer 
</P>
<P>
If you are going to plant something woodsy, such as azaleas or ferns, you need 
to add lots of soil amendment because these plants like a porous soil full of 
organic matter, like the leaf litter found on a forest floor. 
</P>
<P>
You may also want to add lots of amendment in a very sandy soil because organic 
amendments help hold onto water and fertilizer that otherwise would wash right 
through the sand. 
</P>
<P>
In an average clay soil you may want to add sand to keep the surface from 
caking, and you certainly want to add organic amendments and gypsum, a powdery 
white mineral that helps keep a clay soil from getting too heavy and dense. 
Gypsum physically separates the soil particles. 
</P>
<P>
There are lots of ways to go, given that there are so many kinds of soil, 
situations and plants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Mixes 
</P>
<P>
"We have over 500 different mixes, from super-lightweight mixes that can go in 
planters on rooftops or balconies, to special azalea mixes," White said. They 
even have a special soil mix for those who want to grow cactus and succulents, 
which will quickly rot in a normal clay soil. 
</P>
<P>
"But certainly there must be some average recommendation?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if you have a typical clay soil, do not need to raise the level of the 
garden and are just growing ordinary garden flowers and shrubs, we would 
probably recommend adding a 2-inch-high layer of redwood and fir shavings, 
which have been nitrolized, plus some gypsum. "If you needed to add a 2-inch 
layer over 1,000 square feet, you would need 6 yards of material, which is 
about one truck load" is Lewis Topsoil's reply to this broad question. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you don't just spread this on top and plant. You must till it into 
the soil with a power rotary tiller, which can be rented. That even goes for 
topsoil. It too must be tilled in so there is no abrupt line between old soil 
and new, which would repel water and roots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Robbed of Nitrogen 
</P>
<P>
What are "nitrolized" shavings? Wood byproducts such as sawdust or shavings 
that have not been thoroughly composted, will rob the soil of nitrogen, that 
all-important fertilizer element. To prevent this, the topsoil companies can 
add nitrogen to the product, so it is readily available to aid decomposition. 
Be sure to ask if amendments have been nitrolized or have had nitrogen added. 
</P>
<P>
These organic amendments can also be bought by the bag at nurseries or you can 
bag it yourself at building or garden supply stores, but getting a truckload at 
a time offers considerable savings. By the truckload, it costs about half what 
it does by the bag. 
</P>
<P>
At this time of year, the very beginning of the fall planting season -- our 
best planting season -- you may be contemplating major changes and replanting 
and a truck load of organic amendments will make a tremendous difference in 
your soil. Be sure you have a wheelbarrow to cart it around and a place to 
store it until you use it up. A truckload makes a very big pile.

SOAPS COMBINED WITH INSECTICIDES SEEN AS WAY TO KILL BUGS WITHOUT HARM TO 
ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By THOMAS CAIRNS, Cairns is a Studio City-based rose aficionado. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Roses are thought to be easy prey to all sorts of bugs and beasties and 
diseases, and while modern pesticides offer a convenient way to curb such 
problems in the garden, there is a regeneration of products that are reported 
to have no toxicity to humans, soil and ground water. 
</P>
<P>
The main ingredients are soaps that have insecticidal and fungicidal 
properties, marketed by Safer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Over a century ago, soaps derived from fish and shale oils were used to combat 
the rose aphid and other insects, but just as they were becoming commercially 
available in the late 1920s, modern pesticides appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 60 years later, in the 1980s, the tables seem about to be reversed. The 
public's growing perception of pesticides as dangerous and toxic to the 
environment has stimulated a re-investigation of certain soaps as nontoxic 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
The secret of producing the right soap for the right job, be it against 
insects, fungus, weeds or spider mites, has been pioneered by Safer Inc. Their 
research chemists have quickly identified which soaps among the potential 100 
or so members of this chemical class are actively pesticidal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concept All Wrong 
</P>
<P>
The concept by home gardeners that hand soaps or Woolite are effective agents 
is just all wrong. Household soaps, for instance, contain a mixture of about 10 
different soaps all found to be ineffective as insecticides. 
</P>
<P>
Application of such household products can actually harm your rose plants. The 
soaps studied by Safer Inc. have been carefully selected to target particular 
insects and diseases. For example, Safer soaps destroy the ability of the 
insect to breathe by interacting with the semipermeability of their cell 
membranes. 
</P>
<P>
These new soaps have strengths and weaknesses. Their general acceptance is 
based on the simple fact that they are nontoxic to humans and do not threaten 
the environment (soil and ground water). Their weakness or flaw is that they 
are contact killers -- there is no residual or long-lasting protection much 
beyond the day after they are applied to the roses. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional pesticides and fungicides such as Orthene and Funginex, on the 
other hand, do have good residual effects lasting as long as seven to 14 days 
to ensure a full measure of control over future invasions. 
</P>
<P>
Soap sprays may also harm the foliage of roses. Most roses in their first bloom 
cycle have lush new growth that is extremely tender. Frequent applications of 
soap-based products have been observed to cause such tender foliage to be 
disfigured and often destroyed, particularly if used more often than weekly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed With Pesticides 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma lies in the inability of soap-based products to have long-lasting 
control, thereby encouraging multiple applications per week. Since roses always 
have new tender growth, whatever the month, care should be exercised. 
</P>
<P>
Since these soaps are natural spreader-stickers they can enhance the effect of 
pesticides when the two are mixed together. Most pesticide formulations for 
home use already have a spreader-sticker incorporated into them to make sure 
the pesticide remains on the foliage after spraying. 
</P>
<P>
What the new soap-based products offer is an additional spreader-sticker that 
is not merely an inactive ingredient but an active agent against the pests. 
Should you want to try this, proceed cautiously, using minimum amounts of 
pesticide and soap until you are sure they will not harm the plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fighting Spider Mite 
</P>
<P>
What might be considered the most beneficial aspect of soap-based products is 
the development of a miticide to fight the spider mite problem. In the heat of 
summer, spider mites can greatly expand their populations into the millions on 
the underside of the foliage. 
</P>
<P>
If unchecked, they literally suck the life out of the foliage, causing complete 
defoliation of the rose bush though not the death of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The conventional pesticides like Vendex and Plictran recommended to kill spider 
mites can be harmful to the young developing foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Rose growers have elected to spray the undersides of the foliage with plain 
water to wash off the mites rather than use toxic chemicals. The option of 
using a soap-based product is a therefore welcome relief since washing with 
water was not a totally effective procedure.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On windy days, Gene O'Brien's festive front yard might remind people of a 
circus calliope. Or Flag Day on the deck of a World War II aircraft carrier. 
Propellers whiz, carousels creak into motion, birds twirl, and O'Brien's prized 
zinnias, fat ones in a variety of colors, bob like pennants. 
</P>
<P>
That's when O'Brien, a rumpled man with a Puckish smile and a wry, 
self-deprecating humor, likes to stand out on the front porch of the little 
square house with the stuccoed walls and take it all in. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for something like this," he says, "I'd go batty. It's really 
been a savior for me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Idiot's Delight' 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, O'Brien -- officially Walter E. O'Brien, but his friends call 
him Gene -- has converted his whole house into a kind of whirligig atelier, 
with most of its products ending up outside on the lawn. His scroll saw sits on 
a table in the cluttered living room. A rented copying machine, for shrinking 
or magnifying patterns, is nearby. Another power saw, for making straight cuts, 
stands in the middle of the garage. Works in progress are propped against a 
wall in the bedroom or laid out on the floor in the game room. Bits of 
Plexiglas are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of soothing," he says of his hobby. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien got into whirligigs -- "idiot's delight," he says with a guffaw -- 
about four years ago. But it wasn't until last year, right after his wife of 32 
years died, that he became consumed by it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get into something to take my mind off of her," says O'Brien, 68, 
a retired produce manager for Von's. 
</P>
<P>
Now he turns them out in flocks. Plastic cardinals and blue jays, wings 
churning, circle a winged pin-up girl. Reindeer revolve around a pair of 
snowmen. Coyotes and butterflies, on posts extended from the edge of the roof, 
whirl like vintage flying machines. 
</P>
<P>
The molded propellers seem to offer endless possibilities. "You can put a 
whirligig on anything," O'Brien says, pointing at a swan with twirling 
propellers. "That swan used to be a planter." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that O'Brien's lawn is small. "I keep running out of space," 
says O'Brien, who has taken to giving the whirligigs to neighbors and 
passers-by. Already, the roof antennas of three of O'Brien's neighbors are 
festooned with O'Brien-crafted whirligigs. 
</P>
<P>
People who wander into the neighborhood slow their cars at the sight of the 
brightly decorated house. "There's one now," says O'Brien delightedly, 
indicating a woman motorist who has pulled over across the street to study the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
But along Olmby street, the whirligig man is just one of the neighbors -- one 
with a wide streak of generosity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friendly Neighborhood 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood is a friendly sort of place, with tidy stucco houses and folks 
who share recipes and pass out the products of their back-yard gardens. 
"Somebody told me to plant four zucchini plants," says O'Brien's neighbor Gene 
Boyd, shrugging hopelessly. "Now I've been keeping the whole neighborhood in 
zucchinis for months." 
</P>
<P>
"Princes of people," says O'Brien, who has lived there for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood's most noteworthy former citizen is singer Vikki Carr. "Her 
brother still lives right there on Chariette Street," says Howard Daykin, who 
lives across the street from O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
"Once in a while she'll ride by on a bike," adds Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
Friends like Daykin and Boyd drop by O'Brien's place regularly. Daykin, 75, a 
retired Robinson's delivery truck driver, comes in for an occasional cigarette. 
"I can't smoke at home," he says. "My wife smells it." 
</P>
<P>
Boyd stops by to see what O'Brien is working on. "He's the neighborhood 
celebrity," says Boyd, 69, a retired accountant who serves as the Rosemead 
Chamber of Commerce's ambassador at large. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd marvels that no one steals O'Brien's display. "Not even on Halloween," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women Are Greatest Admirers 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, O'Brien says, it's women -- "the middle-aged ladies" -- who are 
the greatest admirers of his work. "They're the ones who ooh and aah," he says. 
"I haven't seen any kid like it yet. They could care less." 
</P>
<P>
"Gene, you know they like it," interrupts Boyd. "They don't bother it. If they 
didn't like it, they'd tear it down." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien scoffs and settles deeper into his couch. For all his laid-back 
informality, O'Brien is an admittedly stricken man. "It's all play," he says 
with breezy melancholy. "That's all I do. Get up and play and eat." 
</P>
<P>
Things were going splendidly before his wife, Marian, died last year, O'Brien 
says. She had retired from her job as a bookkeeper; the house was paid off, and 
the couple were busy. "We went to Tahiti, clear down to Acapulco and up to 
Seattle several times," he says. "We'd make a short trip to Las Vegas every 
third month or so. We had it knocked there until Marian had to go bye-bye." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, who was born in Kansas but settled in California in 1946 after a stint 
in the U. S. Coast Guard, was just learning how to make the colorful 
decorations in his front yard. At first he used wood, working from plans bought 
through crafts catalogues. "Marian had some good suggestions," he says. "Say 
the plan didn't have a good design, the eyeball was in the wrong place or 
something. That's when she was good." 
</P>
<P>
But Marian suffered a stroke early last year. "She just went downhill real 
fast," says O'Brien. She died in August. "I miss her something awful." 
</P>
<P>
Now, besides making new whirligigs, O'Brien putters around the kitchen and 
spends time with his older brother, George -- "another lost soul." 
</P>
<P>
George's wife died four years ago, and most of his spare time is spent 
prospecting for gold, O'Brien says. "He's got a claim in the desert up above 
Barstow somewhere," O'Brien says. "He goes out pretty near every weekend. It's 
a bunch of old fogies who meet out there, cook and sit around telling stories. 
Like about the guy who found a vein worth $60,000. That's their dream -- to hit 
the big one. But they're tickled to death just to find a little speck of gold." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien's dream is more modest. No more trips for him or even prospecting 
excursions to the desert. "I'll never go near Las Vegas again," he says. 
</P>
<P>
No, he'll stay in the house mostly, experiment with new recipes (there's a 
carrot pie with a potato crust that he's excited about) and make new 
whirligigs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting Ready for Christmas 
</P>
<P>
Since he started using Plexiglas, he has spent more money for materials, he 
says, but the whirligigs last a lot longer. "Those wood ones ain't worth the 
powder you need to blow them up with," he says. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien is getting ready for Christmas. New plastic carolers, reindeer, angels 
and Santa Clauses fill the house, and he's planning a big train to stretch 
across the lawn. The Plexiglas colors are gorgeous, he says, and they'll never 
fade. 
</P>
<P>
As the afternoon wind starts kicking up, O'Brien admires his own handiwork 
through the living-room window. "The way they're made, I don't think they'll 
ever wear out," he says. "They'll just go on forever."

A TALE OF TWO CITIES; 
</P>
<P>
PASADENA, POMONA SEEK MANAGERS IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to the selection of city managers in the San Gabriel Valley, east 
is east and west is west, and never the twain shall meet. 
</P>
<P>
City councils in the valley's two largest cities, Pasadena on the west and 
Pomona on the east, have begun the task of filling their top city 
administrative posts by taking radically different approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena City Manager Donald F. McIntyre plans to retire in June after 17 years 
on the job. The council -- known as the Board of Directors -- has hired a team 
to begin the recruitment process by drawing a profile of the ideal Pasadena 
city manager. The recruiters will meet with board members and the public to 
gather information for the profile and then launch a nationwide search for 
qualified applicants, screening them before the board interviews the finalists. 
</P>
<P>
The recruitment team will receive $28,000, plus expenses. The process will take 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Pomona, where the last permanent city administrator was fired in 
May and an interim replacement quit after five weeks on the job, the City 
Council is taking the do-it-yourself approach, spending about $3,000 on 
help-wanted ads. 
</P>
<P>
The ads have been placed in The Times, two minority newspapers, a municipal job 
bulletin and the magazine of the League of California Cities. Council members 
are reviewing the job applications and will meet to choose the individuals to 
be invited to interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant said the council is running the recruitment 
itself after spending $10,000 for a firm to help recruit its last permanent 
administrator, who lasted only 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
The ad inviting job applications says Pomona is seeking an individual with a 
strong background in local government, knowledge of fiscal and community 
development issues, a bachelor's degree in business or public administration, a 
stable employment history and recent employment in city administration. The ad 
says experience in working in a multi-ethnic community would be a plus, and 
demonstrated success in budget and financial management is essential. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mark Nymeyer said the next city administrator also should be adept 
at working in a volatile environment, a qualification that could be in 
considerable demand in Pomona's often stormy political climate. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be some wimp who can't take a little bit of heat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer said the administrator must work with council members with diverse 
priorities, ranging from his own concern about keeping taxes low to Bryant's 
crusades for the downtrodden and Tomas Ursua's interest in low-cost housing. 
"The person has to be pretty phenomenal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has received more than 100 applications for the job, a fact that 
Nymeyer said surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
When the council majority fired City Administrator A. J. Wilson last May over 
the objections of Nymeyer and Mayor Donna Smith, both said the city would have 
trouble attracting a strong successor. The mayor said: "Anyone with any brains 
is not going to apply for the manager's job in Pomona." 
</P>
<P>
Smith was ill last week and unavailable for comment on the applications, but 
Nymeyer said at least a dozen applicants meet the job requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Nell Soto concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten some really good candidates," she said. "There are a lot of 
people who want to come to Pomona." 
</P>
<P>
The applicants range from recent college graduates who have worked as interns 
to people with 20 to 30 years of experience in government. The deadline for 
submitting applications was Friday. 
</P>
<P>
One San Gabriel Valley city administrator said Pomona is unlikely to attract a 
manager from a city of comparable size because of its divided council, but 
should be able to hire the manager of a smaller city seeking career 
advancement. The chance to manage a city of more than 100,000 people with its 
own police and fire departments is always attractive, he said, even when job 
security is poor. 
</P>
<P>
The same administrator said Pasadena's elaborate process for selecting a 
successor to McIntyre is unnecessary and simply feeds the city's ego. Pasadena 
always fills its top jobs with a national search even though there is a large 
pool of qualified candidates who already live in Southern California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena City Director Rick Cole said no one can say in advance whether an 
extensive recruitment effort is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Important Decision 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the next city manager already knows about the job and is planning to 
apply," Cole said. In that case, the city will have wasted a lot of time and 
money on recruitment. But, he said, it could be that the best choice lives far 
away and "will be the last guy called" by recruiters. In that case, he said, 
the extra time and money will have been well spent. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said the choice of the next city manager is the most important decision 
any city director is likely to make during his term on the board. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the next city manager holds the position as long as McIntyre 
did, he will be in the job until 2010. 
</P>
<P>
"People have very little understanding of what city government would be like" 
without McIntyre, who has held his post longer than any current director, 
commissioner or department head, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
That is one reason why the city needs to go through the process of carefully 
considering the qualities a city manager should possess, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The process will begin with a public meeting conducted by the board from 9 a.m. 
to noon Sept. 30 at the Pasadena Conference Center. The city is sending 
invitations to 500 commissioners, heads of organizations and other community 
leaders asking them to participate in the discussion of the skills and 
characteristics needed in a city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The city has hired two firms, RJA Management Services Inc. of Arcadia and 
Shannon &amp; Associates of Sacramento, to help develop the list of 
qualifications and undertake the recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Casual' Process 
</P>
<P>
Former Pasadena Mayor Donald Yokaitis said the process Pasadena used when 
McIntyre was hired was much simpler. The city employed a retired city manager 
to screen applicants and then interviewed several candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we were a little more casual, but I think it worked out pretty good," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William E. Thomson said the city board should be ready to appoint a new 
city manager by March or early April. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena city manager's position carries a salary range of $101,198 to 
$126,498 a year. Pomona has not set a salary but paid its last city 
administrator $82,644. Fire Chief Tom Fee is serving as interim city 
administrator without compensation beyond his Fire Department salary. Fee said 
he has not applied for the permanent position. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona council members said they hope to appoint a permanent administrator by 
November.

LONG BEACH'S 4-YEAR HIGH SCHOOL PLAN MAKES DEBUT 
</P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the 10th-graders, entering high school the first time last week was not all 
that bad. The seniors now have ninth-graders to kick around. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great. We won't get picked on," explained Louie Williams, a 10th-grader 
at Millikan High School. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the Long Beach Unified School District, some 
ninth-graders have been switched to high schools this year. And some 
sixth-graders have been moved into schools with seventh- and eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 students, including kindergartners, entered new schools last week, 
district spokesman Richard G. Van Der Laan said. "We've moved more students 
this year than after the earthquake of '33," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Adding ninth-graders to a high school has made things easier for 10th-graders 
such as Williams and Michelle Mejia, who on Wednesday crossed the great divide 
from junior high to high school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Scared, Because We're Lost' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good because there are younger ones below us," said Mejia, 15. 
Williams added: "Mainly, (seniors) tease them because they get lost." 
</P>
<P>
The 10th-graders had their share of trouble searching for classrooms the first 
day. But the younger ninth-graders seemed most vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
"We're scared now, because we're lost," ninth-grader Yen Huynh, 14, said 
half-jokingly. She was wandering through a Millikan High hallway with freshman 
Norma Corona several minutes after a bell announced the beginning of third 
period. "It feels strange being around bigger people," Corona added. 
</P>
<P>
But several freshmen said they were happy about the transition. They said they 
didn't mind missing out on the traditional "King of the Hill" status in junior 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many freshmen, Dave Najar, 14, appeared relaxed and confident on his 
first day of high school. 
</P>
<P>
What's the best part of high school? 
</P>
<P>
"Being with a better crowd," Najar said. "In junior high, you're with a lower 
class. High school students get a little more respect." 
</P>
<P>
But in the hierarchy of high school -- where seniors are above juniors, who are 
above sophomores, who are above freshmen -- nothing is better than being a 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
As senior Chris Karrenberg explained: "You feel like you have more power, 
mainly because you know how the system works and what you can get away with." 
</P>
<P>
Seniors also tend to know more people. Senior Kari Sunde, arms outstretched, 
greeted each friend with a shriek and a hug. 
</P>
<P>
When the proposal to transfer ninth-graders to high schools surfaced last year, 
more than 800 parents signed petitions opposing the plan. Some said at a 
hearing that they feared the school board was rushing things, that less mature 
ninth-graders would encounter more peer pressure to fight, take drugs and 
engage in sex. 
</P>
<P>
But a report prepared by a Joint Task Force on School Facilities stated that 
four-year high schools would, among other things, provide ninth-graders with 
more course choices and would give them a chance to participate in a greater 
variety of athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enrollment Growing 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan, six junior high schools were converted to middle schools. 
Sixth grade was added to seventh and eighth grade in the middle schools, as 
district officials attempt to ease overcrowded conditions in elementary 
schools. The school district's enrollment, which has surpassed 67,000, is 
growing by 1,200 students a year, according to school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators plan to convert the remaining eight junior highs to middle 
schools by next September, said Martha Keizer, the district's middle school 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the seventh- and eighth-graders, who attend six or seven classes each 
day, sixth-graders are being divided into teams taught by two teachers, 
providing "a smaller, supportive environment," Keizer said. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth-grade teachers "will work as teacher, counselor, father and mother," 
said Juan de Cordova, principal at Cecil B. DeMille Middle School. "The idea is 
to provide them with real nurturing because they're very young." 
</P>
<P>
"All the teachers are excited about the idea (of shifting sixth-graders)," de 
Cordova said. "They feel this is the best thing that has happened in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninth-graders really belong in high school," de Cordova said. "By the same 
token, sixth-graders have more in common with seventh- and eighth-graders than 
with younger kids. They're more apt to learn. Oftentimes, ninth-graders want to 
be big-man-about-campus and that becomes more important than schooling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Still Play a Lot' 
</P>
<P>
De Cordova said he does not expect the eighth-graders to assume that haughty 
role now that they're the oldest on campus. "They're young. They still play a 
lot. They're kids," the principal said. "It's amazing what difference one year 
can make." 
</P>
<P>
To help the sixth-graders, each new middle school held orientations for the 
students and teachers. At the high schools, freshmen also attended orientation 
sessions on their first day. 
</P>
<P>
In Room 219 at Millikan, ninth-graders filled out a series of registration, 
emergency, informational and locker assignment cards. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't this fun, huh, guys?" teacher Larry Hicks asked while handing out three 
of the cards. "You put your name on this card . . . everything on here you 
transfer to this (other) card, and then you put your locker number on this one. 
Are we clear?" 
</P>
<P>
Julia Garcia did not understand a word. The ninth-grader sitting in the back of 
the classroom said she recently moved from Mexico, does not speak any English 
and had not been in school for two years. Yet, she is scheduled to attend only 
two classes for non-English-speaking students. Asked if she was nervous, she 
said, "Si, mucho." 
</P>
<P>
She probably has been assigned to classes for English-speaking students because 
bilingual classes have been filled, said Harold Barnes, Millikan assistant 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
School officials acknowledge that there is a severe shortage of bilingual 
teachers in the district, in which ethnic student enrollment has increased. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical of Financing 
</P>
<P>
Other major issues confronting the schools are large class sizes, drugs, gangs 
and lack of funds, Barnes said. "The state doesn't finance schools the way they 
should," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Barnes said his school has accommodated the ninth-graders -- an increase of 
more than 800 students -- by erecting nine portable classrooms and converting 
several teacher lounges to small classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the teachers were not happy about giving up their lounges, but Barnes 
praised the school board's decision to move younger students to high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the ninth-graders will fit better here," he said.

LATINO AUTHOR FOSTERS HIGH HOPES FOR FILM

<TEXT>
<P>
When the story begins, marital problems between his Mexican mother and Anglo 
father had sent 12-year-old Mike Rutledge to his grandparents' small Arizona 
ranch, where Spanish is spoken and salsa is spooned over food, not just scooped 
from a bowl with tortilla chips. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the story ends, young Mike -- Miguel Antonio to his loving 
grandparents -- has lost his reluctance to speak Spanish and has brought home 
to suburban Los Angeles a desire to cultivate his Latino roots. 
</P>
<P>
Mike is the central character in a film called "Always Roses." It was produced 
and written by George Figueroa, 25, of Whittier. The Princeton University 
graduate is one of three aspiring film makers chosen from 103 applicants 
nationwide to be part of the Hispanic Film/Video program, spokeswoman Esther 
Renteria said. 
</P>
<P>
The program is sponsored by the National Hispanic Media Coalition, Universal 
Television, the Hispanic Academy of Media Arts and Sciences, and Columbia 
College in Hollywood. Its goal is to encourage and help more Latinos to enter 
and enrich the movie business with their ideas and stories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes for Film Career 
</P>
<P>
The program provides funding and technical assistance to produce short films to 
showcase the talents of the young Latinos, Renteria said. 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa hopes his 24-minute film will catch the eye of a movie executive and 
lead to a film career. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to produce my own scripts and eventually direct them as well," 
Figueroa said in a recent interview. "That's really the only way to control the 
outcome." 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa graduated from Princeton in 1986 with a bachelor's degree in art 
history. He has worked at different jobs as a paralegal and word processor, and 
planned on entering law school to continue a family tradition. His father, 
William, his sister, Ana, and his brother, William Jr., are lawyers. George's 
younger brother, Rafael, attends law school at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Encouraged to Go to Law School 
</P>
<P>
But then Figueroa heard about the film program and submitted a script that was 
accepted for production. The finished film was first shown earlier this month 
in a screening room at Universal Studios. It will be shown Thursday at a film 
symposium at Loyola Marymount University in Westchester, Figueroa said. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally my parents encouraged me to go to law school, but I . . . wanted to 
explore some creative endeavors," Figueroa said. "I put on paper an idea I had 
banging around in my head for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa, who was raised in suburban Whittier and nearby Santa Fe Springs, did 
not have to look far for the themes explored in "Always Roses." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it's difficult growing up in a culture where English is a 
dominating language, and if you convey hints of your ethnic heritage, it can be 
looked down upon," Figueroa said. "You have to overcome that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only been fairly recently that I've been able to really feel a sense of 
pride in my culture and heritage and all that entails, with its language and 
traditions." 
</P>
<P>
The film is not autobiographical, but there are strong parallels to Figueroa's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"What I tried to capture in the script, in the film, were reminiscences, bits 
and pieces of my recollections and experiences of my grandparents from my early 
childhood on," Figueroa said. "I just tried to put together the essence of what 
they were, their pride and their grounding, firmly planted in their roots and 
in their heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 35-millimeter film was shot on location near Tucson, Ariz. It was a 
family affair, with Figueroa's sister helping to co-produce the film. Aunts, 
uncles and cousins provided props and meals for the film crew. The movie was 
produced on a $35,000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Singer Plays Grandfather 
</P>
<P>
One of the stars of the film is country music star Freddy Fender, who plays 
Mike's grandfather. Child actor Bryant Mason plays the role of Mike. All of the 
actors donated their time to the project. They will be paid only if it is 
picked up for commercial distribution, Figueroa said. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't any money for salaries," he said. "If I had paid myself as writer 
or producer, it would have (taken money) from the production." 
</P>
<P>
"Always Roses" was not Figueroa's first attempt at writing a movie script. He 
wrote a feature-length script that dealt with the conflicts a Latina attorney 
encounters in an Anglo- and male-dominated profession. That script was rejected 
by several studios. 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa has several ideas brewing for his next effort. He said he would like 
to write about the life of United Farm Workers leader Cesar Chavez and his 
campaigns for improved working conditions for agricultural workers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an important figure politically and historically," Figueroa said. "People 
of my generation don't really know him that well. I'd like to increase 
awareness of him and his struggles."

RESIDENTS OF DIAMOND BAR WILL DEVELOP GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of Diamond Bar, the county's newest city, will take the first step 
this week toward developing a general plan that will tackle escalating concerns 
over traffic congestion and development. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty Diamond Bar residents, chosen by the City Council, and Councilmen Gary 
Werner and Gary Miller will meet Thursday night as the city's general plan 
committee. They will be responsible for drafting the plan, which is expected to 
take up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Robert Van Nort, who will preside over most of the committee 
meetings, said he foresees a lengthy, sometimes grueling process of dividing 
the group into subcommittees to address the environment, traffic, housing, 
earthquake safety and other issues affecting the city of 47,000. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic through Diamond Bar, and devising methods to control it, has always 
been a rallying point in the community, and the plan is expected to reflect the 
city's firm stand against traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
When San Bernardino County officials extended Grand Avenue to Diamond Bar 
before the city was incorporated, Los Angeles County feared that the road would 
bring thousands of additional cars to the area from the rapidly growing 
community of Chino Hills. So Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum 
responded by having a fence and wooden barricades.

OVER-35 WOMEN ARE DISCOVERING THE APPEAL OF LETTING THEIR YEARS SHOW 
</P>

Kim Yumiko Nagatani, Claire Kendall and Margaret Sargent are professional 
models caught up in one of America's biggest trends. At 38, 50 and 61, 
respectively, they're part of the collective aging of America, which is quickly 
taking the emphasis off youth. By 1996, more than half of the U.S. population 
will be over 35, according to the Census Bureau. But already the monumental 
shift in demographics is making a major impact on culture and appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Grandmothers are suddenly the rage, so I'm doing more modeling," notes 
Sargent, who frequently poses for commercials and ads. Kendall and Nagatani say 
that they're working about twice as much as they did last year. "There are a 
lot of women out there who are my age," Kendall says. "They want to feel that 
it's OK to age, as long as you look your best. So older models are in demand." 
</P>
<P>
The youth-oriented cosmetics industry is responding to middle-age needs. The 
sophisticated colors, custom-blended products and anti-aging treatments that 
predominate in cosmetics collections this fall are targeted at women ages 35 to 
65. Despite glitzy makeup ads that feature 20-year-old models, the message at 
the beauty counter is that it's hip to be pushing 40, 50 or even 60something. 
Young, wrinkle-free models are made up to look older or, at least, ageless in 
the hope that mature faces will attract mature consumers. Revlon, for instance, 
recently announced the return of Lauren Hutton, now 45, to promote one of its 
lines. And at 37, Isabella Rossellini, continues to be the Lancome "face," a 
job she's had for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
It's no coincidence that cosmetics companies are promoting neutral colors with 
no-shine finishes as this season's most fashionable look. A matte finish 
reflects less light, thus de-emphasizing wrinkles and age lines. "The woman who 
is over 35 today has always been exposed to subtle makeup. She feels that she 
looks her best wearing neutrals," says Andrea Quinn Robinson, president of 
Ultima II and former beauty editor of Vogue. "And nothing looks worse than 
frosted makeup on a heavily creased lid," adds Robinson, who at 46 wears 
earth-tone makeup and her dark blond hair long and straight. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmetics industry executives have been forced to readjust their image of the 
middle-age consumer. "A 45- or 50-year-old woman doesn't think old, dress old 
or act old and, obviously, with that kind of an attitude, she doesn't look 
old," says Tony Michaels, vice president of marketing and advertising at 
Lancome. "Mothers are looking at what their teen-agers are doing with bright 
colors and doing the same with neutrals. They're not wearing less makeup; 
they're wearing it differently -- more eyeliner, more eye shadow." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than dictating colors this year, manufacturers are selling what 
customers say they want. On the eyes, women will be wearing no-shine versions 
of the earth tones so popular in the 1960s and early '70s. Deep shades on the 
lips, rather than the pale hues of 15 or 20 years ago, will update the face for 
the '90s. But red, and even orange, lipsticks are subdued with brown tones. The 
latest foundations will be as close to natural as possible, with delicate peach 
blushers adding just a hint of color on the cheeks. Custom-blended powders and 
foundations, such as those by Charles of the Ritz, Prescriptives, Luminique and 
Visage Beaute, have a tremendous following among women over 35. 
</P>
<P>
Catering to an older consumer, often a working woman, has forced the cosmetics 
industry to give her more than just the makeup colors she wants, says Vivian 
Behrens, vice president of marketing for Estee Lauder cosmetics. "Her time is 
at a premium, so the woman who's over 40 wants products that marry treatment 
and color." 
</P>
<P>
Following the lead of Lear's, Mirabella and other magazines geared to the older 
reader, the cosmetics industry recognizes that while she's willing to look her 
age, the older woman is determined to look her best. Price, it seems, is no 
object. Many anti-aging products, such as La Prairie's Essence of Skin Caviar 
and Chanel's Emulsion No. 1, cost more than $70. Before the anti-aging trend 
hit the cosmetics market three years ago, only the most exclusive skin-care 
products were priced at more than $35. Arie Kopelman, president and chief 
operating officer of Chanel Inc., says that the older woman is willing to pay 
these high prices only for products that make a visible difference because 
"she's been around. She's not stupid. If a woman is going to pay $40, $50 or 
$60 for a face cream, it has to be effective." 
</P>
<P>
At Clinique, which is known for its moderate prices and youthful clientele, new 
products are infrequent, but this month the firm introduced Daily Eye Benefits, 
an eye cream that costs more than $20. Such a release is a sign that the 
industry is preparing for the maturing market. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "Age Wave," which explores the societal ramifications of aging, 
author Ken Dychtwald writes that the cosmetics industry will "experience the 
biggest boom in history" as Americans spend the next several years "trying to 
take their youth with them into old age." That may be true. But 50-year-old 
Claire Kendall says her goal is much less lofty, and she may have already 
achieved it: "I don't want to look 20 or even 30 again. I just want to look the 
best I can now." 
</P>

KIM YUMIKO NAGATANI 
</P>
<P>
At 5 feet, 3 inches, Kim Yumiko Nagatani has been one of Southern California's 
busiest petite models. Now at 38, an age when she had expected to be working 
less, she's in demand because of her mature appearance. Keeping her over-35 
face looking vital means treating dry skin. "I was a beach bunny all my life, 
and now I'm paying for it," the Torrance native laments. So she uses sun block 
and moisturizer to prevent further damage and applies eye cream for 
crow's-feet. In her busy life as a wife and mother of daughters Alyssa, 3, and 
Ayama, 6, Nagatani already wears the new neutrals. "I've worn brown, black and 
charcoal eye shadows since I was a teen-ager," she says.

Claire Kendall of La Canada was in her early 20s when her ash-brown hair turned 
gray. Horrified, she tinted it until she was 43, when upkeep became too 
time-consuming. "I tried to blend the colors with temporary rinses while it was 
growing out, but most of the time I wore scarves and kept my hair super short. 
It was awful," Kendall recalls. Today, at 50, she is one of the West's top 
mature models, sought after for her silver hair. The mother of four sons, 
including race car driver Tommy Kendall, she has her own racing license but 
prefers taking to the ski slopes for her fun. So Kendall spends nine months out 
of the year in Sun Valley, Ida. Exposure to the elements there means her fair 
skin "takes a beating," she says. "I have to protect it with sunscreen all the 
time." Although many of her friends have been turning to cosmetic surgery, 
Kendall says it's not an alternative for her: "Not yet -- I'm basically 
chicken."

MARGARET HOLLAND SARGENT 
</P>
<P>
At 61, Margaret Holland Sargent of Los Angeles is a grandmother, a model and a 
successful portrait artist. Modeling was just a sideline for her in the past, 
Sargent says, but she's working in more television commercials now that she's 
older. Despite the increased on-camera attention, her art still comes first. 
Currently at work on a portrait of her granddaughter, Erin Paige Sargent, the 
artist says most of her paintings are commissioned for private collections and 
others are created for news magazines. Among her most famous subjects are 
Gerald Ford, Margaret Thatcher, Tennessee Williams and Alexander Haig. Studying 
other people's faces has given her insight into her own. "Makeup is just a 
means of creating light and shadows on the face -- I always keep that in mind," 
says Sargent, who acknowledges that even she occasionally falls into a makeup 
rut. When that happens, she consults professional makeup artists during 
modeling assignments for advice on updating colors and application techniques. 
She used a brown tint on her hair until five years ago, when she finally 
decided to let the gray show "because it's kinder to my face." With lighter 
hair to frame her face, she now selects a paler foundation and subtler shades 
of eye shadow than she wore when she was younger. Sargent changes her makeup 
palette seasonally, favoring rosy pinks in the spring and earth tones in the 
fall. "Now that there's a market for grandmother models," she says, "I'm paying 
more attention to makeup."

Autumn makeup this year is monochromatic, with eyes and lips enhanced by subtle 
earth tones instead of bright colors and metallic effects. The new neutral 
colors, matte finishes and intensive treatment products are in response to the 
demands of a more sophisticated consumer, the woman over 35.

HIGH-TECH ARTS COMPLEX PLUGGING INTO MANY OUTLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE WHEELOCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When film maker Gary Meyer takes a break from his work at the Empowerment 
Project, a small Santa Monica film and video studio, he frequently steps next 
door to catch a performance at Highways Performance Space, the 130-seat 
performance art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The directors of Highways, in turn, confer with neighbor Steve Durland, editor 
of High Performance magazine, about the graphic design for their press releases 
and newsletters. Durland can walk over to the Community Arts Resources office 
when he needs to look up information on a computerized arts database. And, of 
course, they all meet at the fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
The Empowerment Project, Highways, High Performance magazine, Community Arts 
Resources and a high-tech communications center called the Electronic Cafe are 
housed in the 18th Street Arts Complex, a compound of tenants dedicated to 
redefining the boundaries of art. 
</P>
<P>
The 55,000-square-foot, five-building center, linked by walkways, patios and 
small gardens, is home to the five community-oriented arts entities plus a 
variety of other commercial art and manufacturing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Highways, the best known of the five, is the only one accessible to the public. 
"We founded Highways to present new performance works that approach social 
issues and to promote collaboration between cultures, genders and disciplines," 
said Linda Frye Burnham, who, along with performance artist Tim Miller, founded 
and directs the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham said Highways keeps busy with four to six full-length productions a 
month, most of which run for two weekends. Burnham and Miller schedule some 
shorter pieces, including poetry, folk tales and dance, and the space is also 
used for literary events and benefits for activist organizations. Burnham says 
box office receipts pay all expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Astro Artz, located in the building next to Highways, provides information to 
artists and the public about new, experimental and unrecognized art (a touring 
troupe of artists and homeless people, for example), chiefly through its 
quarterly magazine, High Performance. Burnham is former editor of High 
Performance, which she founded. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Peeps, Astro Artz executive director, said: "When we were downtown, it 
was hard for people to visit us and we were fairly isolated. We're much more in 
the center of things here and we feel like we have a better finger on the pulse 
of what's going on. It's been extraordinary for us to suddenly be thrust into 
the middle of the community and to have ongoing contact with other artists." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to publishing High Performance, which has about 5,000 subscribers, 
Astro Artz maintains an archive of performance documentation (mostly photos, 
artists' resumes and biographical materials) and periodicals that is open to 
researchers and writers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things happening here from our rubbing shoulders with our 
neighbors, and projects are being born," Peeps said. One project involves her 
neighbors in the Community Arts Resources office. Peeps said Astro Artz and the 
Community Arts Resources office, an information clearinghouse for people in the 
arts, plan to publish a book on how to self-produce arts events in Los Angeles, 
a project tied to the upcoming 1990 Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"The complex is great because there's a certain synergy to being with other 
arts organizations," said Community Arts Resources associate Aaron Paley, 
director of Fringe Festival/Los Angeles in 1987 and the 1988 Festival of Masks 
for the Craft and Folk Art Museum. "We can talk to our peers and bang ideas off 
them. . . . We can get together and do something none of us could have done 
individually." 
</P>
<P>
While Community Arts Resources is involved in producing festivals, performances 
and arts tours, it also maintains and updates a database of arts information 
that was first compiled for the Fringe Festival. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
"One of the big issues in the arts world is getting information and sharing 
it," Paley said. "We created this database because there was no good list 
available for artists to reach other artists and people interested in the arts. 
We've added to the original list and now we have about 15,700 names and 
addresses, classified by 40 different arts disciplines and organized by 
multicultural community groups, which we offer for sale." Rates range from $25 
to $100 for 1,000 names.

Electronic Cafe International is scheduled to open early next year. First 
developed by video artists Sherrie Rabinowitz and Kit Galloway in five 
community cafes for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics Arts Festival, the 1990 
version of Electronic Cafe will be part of what Rabinowitz calls "an 
international cross-cultural, multimedia, multichannel teleconferencing network 
of real cafes." The main activity, she said, "will be computer exchange, with 
computers as art-making machines. People there can exchange art or collaborate 
with people in other cafes. They'll be able to draw or write together on an 
electronic writing tablet." 
</P>
<P>
With cafes planned for Paris, Tokyo and other cities, the network will function 
via satellite and telephone lines. "There could be a live performance at 
Highways that would be transmitted to Paris, and perhaps a live performance 
there transmitted to the Electronic Cafe here, and you'll actually be able to 
watch and then talk to the performers afterward," Rabinowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Empowerment Project also works with video technology. A miniature movie 
studio, it is equipped for video and film production, post-production and 
desktop publishing. Production manager Meyer, who worked with co-directors 
Barbara Trent and David Kasper to produce the 1988 documentary "Cover-Up: 
Behind the Iran-Contra Affair," outlined the project's scope. 
</P>
<P>
"We're film makers, consultants, teachers and organizers," he said. "We make 
documentary films on politically and socially progressive issues. We also 
extend our help to film makers who are working on similar issues and consult 
with them on distribution. In addition, we operate a post-production and 
video-editing facility, which is available to commercial clients, although we 
turn away people who are working on defense projects or pornographic material." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer added: "I consider it as one big compound that sort of belongs to all of 
us. You can't go fax something or go to the High Performance office to shoot 
some graphics without getting the news about what's going on."

HIGHWAYS PERFORMANCE SPACE SEEKS ROUTE TO IMAGINATION WITH ARTISTS LIVING ALONG 
INTERSTATE 5 
</P>

The people at Highways Performance Space want to put Interstate 5 on the map of 
the American imagination. They want I-5 to be synonymous with artistic 
exploration, much like Route 66 once was with wanderlust of a more conventional 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
Highways, which opened in May in Santa Monica's 18th Street Arts Complex, is 
presenting a series of three performance shows from artists along I-5. The 
first, "Border Brujo" by Guillermo Gomez-Pena of Tijuana, opened Thursday and 
concludes tonight. Gomez-Pena has presented his work in the United States, 
Mexico and Canada. Last week, the cross-cultural work was awarded a Bessie, the 
performance art equivalent of an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
The series' second installment -- Thursday through next Sunday -- comes from 
Alice B. Theater, a gay and lesbian group in Seattle. Begun five years ago, 
Alice B. Theater has presented a wide range of drama, dance and performance 
works. The group will produce pieces for the Goodwill Arts Festival, a major 
international event scheduled in conjunction with the Goodwill Games athletic 
competition, next year in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The third work will be the premiere of "Secrets of a Samurai Centerfielder" by 
Dan Kwong of Venice. "Samurai Centerfielder" looks at a boy of Japanese and 
Chinese ancestry who grows up in white Los Angeles while wishing that he could 
be like Willie Davis, the Dodgers' black center fielder. An amalgam of dance, 
monologue, slides and music, the work will play Sept. 28 to Oct. 8 and again 
Oct. 14 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic and life-style diversity of the series pleases Linda Frye Burnham, 
co-director of the performance space. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons we called this 'Highways' is that we liked the concept of a 
north-south axis represented by I-5," she said. "Up until now, the art world 
has looked largely east, mostly to the Northeast. But we're interested in work 
that reflects a locality. We're very tapped into Mexico. It's a very Latin 
American model for art to come out of communities instead of out of one 
regional center." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham foresees a network of performance spaces dotted on and around 
Interstate 5 that would share the expenses of traveling artists and vastly 
increase the number of fresh productions. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone could start in San Diego and work their way up the coast," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena's "Border Brujo" is the most widely known work in the I-5 series. It 
is making its Los Angeles debut after performances in Mexico, Canada and U. S. 
cities, including New York and San Diego. Wednesday, it was awarded one of nine 
Bessies given in the creator category by the Dance Theater Workshop in New 
York. David R. White, workshop executive director, termed it an astonishing 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
"It might literally be seen as a speaking in tongues," he said. "It's a 
performance poem in a way. The ability to move seamlessly from English to 
Spanish to some Indian dialects is quite something. It's a piece on language 
and on ideas, which is unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena, 33, received a master's of fine arts from CalArts in Valencia in 
1982. He said his bruho, or shaman, is a "psychological guide to border 
crossings of different sorts" who assumes 15 different characters during the 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now there is a movement in performance art based very much in language," 
he said. "As part of that movement, I've tried to simplify my work so it will 
be very portable. In this piece, all you have is a table. There is no artifice. 
Everything is on the table: the sound system, the wigs. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is for me to portray the complexity of my cultural journey from 
Mexico to California, from Spanish to English, with no artifice." 
</P>
<P>
Four members of Alice B. Theater, the Seattle company, will do three short 
pieces that they have performed in Edmonton and Toronto in Canada and Buffalo, 
N. Y. All are humorous, said artistic director Rick Rankin. 
</P>
<P>
In "Portrait of Iowa," the players depict pigs, cows, rural highways and other 
corn belt images. In "T.S./Crossing," Susan Finque is a woman who becomes a 
man. Rankin described "Attack of the Zombie Backup Singers," which he wrote, as 
"a 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe' filtered through a gay sensibility, in 
which killer aliens in beehive hairdos attack and 
</P>
<P>
eat the citizens of Clarkville, Ala." 
</P>
<P>
Rankin, 34, said Alice B. Theater has worked hard to overcome a perception that 
gay and lesbian productions are parochial in their vision. About a third of the 
group's audience is non-gay, he said, and its wide range of productions has led 
to city and state funding. 
</P>
<P>
"Alice B. is going to be producing the first national gay and lesbian theater 
festival as part of the Goodwill Games and the Goodwill Arts Festival in 
Seattle in July, 1990," Rankin said. "We'll be part of a festival that includes 
the Bolshoi from Moscow, the Kabuki Theater of Japan and all sorts of 
international groups. We'll have gay and lesbian companies from Los Angeles, 
Anchorage, Toronto, New York and San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Dan Kwong, the final artist in the I-5 series, said he first saw performance 
art 13 years ago and immediately wanted to develop a piece of his own. What 
followed was a long struggle for Kwong, 34, a graduate of the Art Institute of 
Chicago, to discover his message. "Secrets of a Samurai Centerfielder" became 
the vehicle because its character is versed in martial arts and baseball, 
passions that Kwong took from Asian and American cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"This piece is about growing up Asian-American in Los Angeles -- the things 
that happen when your role models, your models of power, desirability and 
attractiveness, are nothing like you." 
</P>
<P>
Kwong is center fielder for the Little Tokyo Giants, a team in a league of 
Japanese-Americans. He has been a member for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
"In playing baseball or any competitive sport, you're repeatedly in a position 
where you have to face every fear, every question or doubt about who you are," 
he said. "The emphasis on winning really taps into your self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
The piece has four monologues and two dance sections, said Kwong, who is 
trained in the martial arts of iaido, judo, tai chi ch'uan and aikido. In 
portions of the piece, the Samurai Centerfielder wields a sword instead of a 
baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
The I-5 series at Highways also includes an exhibition of visual works that can 
be viewed prior to performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The "I-5 Series," Highways Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica; 
performances start at 8:30 p.m.; dates vary. Tickets range from $8 to $10. For 
information, call (213) 453-1755.

NEWSMAKERS: MOON-WALKER STAYS STEP AHEAD

Director Steven Spielberg gave him a run for his money, but singer-moon-walker 
Michael Jackson came out on top for the second straight year in Forbes 
magazine's list of the highest-paid entertainers. Jackson's estimated gross 
income for 1989 is $65 million, giving him a two-year total of $125 million. 
Spielberg's 1989 total is expected to be about $64 million, for a 1988-89 total 
of $105 million. The list counts as entertainers a range of personalities that 
includes such fields as sports and cartooning. In third place is comedian Bill 
Cosby with a $95-million total. The rest of the two-year Top 10 are: boxer Mike 
Tyson, with $71 million; "Peanuts" cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, $60 million; 
actor-comedian Eddie Murphy, $57 million; Pink Floyd, $56 million; the Rolling 
Stones, $55 million; talk show host Oprah Winfrey, $55 million, and singer 
George Michael, $47 million. Others on the list, which goes to No. 40, include 
"Garfield" cartoonist Jim Davis, No. 30 at $25 million, and actor Mel Gibson, 
No. 40 at $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speaking of moonwalks and money, Soviet Parliament member Boris N. Yeltsin 
said on a tour of the Johnson Space Center in Houston that the United States or 
the Soviet Union should drop its space program. Yeltsin told center director 
Aaron Cohen that the two countries should join forces to explore the moon and 
Mars. "We're spending more money on space exploration because we are 
competing," Yeltsin said. The maverick Soviet politician has said the Soviets 
should reduce their space spending and spend more on their economy, and he said 
a joint space program would improve superpower relations. "I don't care who 
gets to the moon sooner. Whether it's the Soviet Union or the U.S. doesn't 
matter to me," Yeltsin said. "Sometimes I wish one of you would come over and 
whisper in my ear which of the space programs we could easily get rid of." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spy novelist John Le Carre is one of the latest beneficiaries of the more 
open policies in the Soviet Union. His latest best-seller, "The Russia House," 
will be published next year in that country, Tass reported. The contract signed 
at the Moscow International Book Fair calls for 100,000 copies to be printed in 
the Russian language. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A publicist said singer Neneh Cherry has dropped out of a tour with the 
group Fine Young Cannibals because she has Lyme disease. She had performed on 
the tour's opening night but collapsed the next day after appearing as a 
presenter on the MTV music video awards program. DAVE JOHNSON

REPRODUCTIONS OF NEON CLOCKS TURN BACK HANDS OF TIME 
</P>

<P>
Ken Baisa works full-time as an engineer, then trudges to his garage to pursue 
his true passion: turning back the hands of time. 
</P>
<P>
Baisa reproduces neon clocks that were the advertising rage of the 1930s and 
1940s and are now making a comeback with businesses and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a night that really goes by that I'm not out here," said Baisa as 
he surveyed the workshop where he makes replicas of neon timepieces for 
nostalgia lovers and Art Deco fans. 
</P>
<P>
Neon signs first appeared in the United States in 1923 at a Los Angeles auto 
dealership. Neon clocks began showing up in the 1930s in theaters and soda 
fountains. A smaller, 12-inch table-top model appeared on the back bar in 
taverns and lounges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brightly Colored Clocks 
</P>
<P>
Baisa, 48, has admired the brightly colored clocks since the days of his 
childhood in San Francisco, when he often would go to matinees and gaze at the 
green glow of the clock next to the movie screens. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of neon clocks came to a jarring halt in the 1950s, when 
incandescent and fluorescent signs appeared and television emerged as the main 
visual advertising medium. 
</P>
<P>
But that age of neon clocks never ended for Baisa. In the late 1960s, he 
already had begun work at Palo Alto-based Beckman Instruments -- makers of 
medical instruments -- and spent his spare time winning motorcycle races. 
</P>
<P>
But he continued to be a clock watcher. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Baisa began to make reproductions of the clocks, based on the famous 
Glo-Dial line, since restoring often cost too much and old clocks were hard to 
find. Then he had a brainstorm -- add personal messages to the clocks. 
</P>
<P>
His reproductions can look just like the originals, including the precise 
lettering, plus added personalized sayings on the glass and two-tone colors for 
the neon. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want something close enough and want it for another 40 years," 
consumers will buy the reproductions, said Baisa, a medium-height, stocky man 
with a graying mustache and beard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Logo on Each Unit 
</P>
<P>
Baisa said his business logo, Ken-Glo Clocks, is printed in small letters on 
every reproduction so that it cannot be passed off as an original. 
</P>
<P>
He reproduces five basic models of the old-style neon clocks, including the 
hexagon, the 12-inch table-top, the 14-inch wall mount, the "chase wheel" and 
the 23-inch type. 
</P>
<P>
"Chase wheel" refers to neon that becomes an optical illusion, with the 
surrounding wheel of neon appearing to move faster as someone moves back from 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Prices range from $295 to $650 for Baisa's clocks, which are sold from a co-op 
store he and his wife, Sandy, belong to called Collector's Market Antiques near 
his home in San Carlos, a small city 25 miles south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
He said his clocks are better than the originals because he has improved on the 
on-off switches, the painting and the chrome plating. 
</P>
<P>
The art work, performed by co-worker Allen Gianoli, is also top-quality and 
will include whatever the customer wishes -- if there's room on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"I want somebody who's going to pay that kind of money to be proud of it," 
Baisa said, admitting that he enjoys hearing customers' compliments when they 
come to pick up their prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect Baisa to quit his job any time soon so he can make oodles of 
clocks and reap higher profits. "That's not the fun of it," he said. 
"Everything I do is like creating something again. 
</P>
<P>
"You start getting people mass-producing them, it won't be the same," he said. 
"They'll be like jukeboxes. They won't be a collectible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photographs Each One 
</P>
<P>
His clocks are such one-of-a-kind creations that he takes a photograph of each 
one before shipping it off to the customer. He's received orders from as far 
away as England, France, Japan and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
One 23-inch clock still in his garage -- his workshop shares space with a 1934 
Ford car he has been planning to restore for four years -- belongs to San 
Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The red-orange clock reads "San Francisco 49ers World Champions Super Bowls 
XVI, XIX, XXIII" around the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Baisa said DeBartolo wants it for his trophy room. 
</P>
<P>
"I went more for authenticity than I did for production," he says of his 
reproductions. "I want people to think this is a 10-plus. I got to make them 
like they were."

SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM, ROBIN HOOD'S OLD FOE, PRESERVES THE LEGEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY HELIER, Reuters 
</P>

NOTTINGHAM, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sheriff of Nottingham speaks in a melodic West Indian voice and has only 
nice things to say about his archenemy Robin Hood, who is still bringing in the 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a socialist because he always thought about the poor people, and he 
used to rob the rich for the poor," the admiring sheriff said in his office 
overlooking Nottingham's main square. 
</P>
<P>
The words don't seem strange from the legendary outlaw's foe. Sheriff Tony 
Robinson, Jamaican-born and the first black to hold the 1,000-year-old office, 
is a Labor Party town councilor and veteran trade union activist. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of chasing bands of merry men in Sherwood Forest, the sheriff of 
Nottingham is charged with attracting tourists to this central English city of 
250,000 where Robin Hood is big business. 
</P>
<P>
"The sheriff in the old days used to be a bad man. But I have to show that I am 
a peaceful sheriff and a good sheriff," says the 68-year-old retired bus driver 
and father of seven. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a gunslinger," he adds, noting that many people still associate his 
title with the American Wild West. 
</P>
<P>
Nottingham is one of only 16 British areas that have not abolished the honorary 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Since Robinson's appointment to the one-year post by the City Council earlier 
this year, he has gone on a promotional tour of West Germany and plans to visit 
the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 600,000 tourists visited Nottingham and surrounding 
Nottinghamshire, whose attractions include Sherwood Forest with the Robin Hood 
Center, which gives a history of the area and its most famous outlaw, and the 
Major Oak, where legend has it he hid from the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see if I can bring in three times, four times that amount into the 
city," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
When he is not out promoting his town, the sheriff visits homes for the 
elderly, meets schoolchildren and hands out bouquets to couples celebrating 
their golden or diamond anniversaries. 
</P>
<P>
Historians have often questioned whether Robin Hood, Friar Tuck, Little John 
and Maid Marian ever existed. Only a year ago, even Nottingham Council shot an 
arrow at the legend that had been enriching its coffers. 
</P>
<P>
It issued a leaflet claiming that Robin Hood, far from being a romantic rogue, 
was just a plain medieval forester. 
</P>
<P>
But the leaflet was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
A new one, headlined "The Legend of Robin Hood," states matter-of-factly that 
"Robin Hood lived in Sherwood Forest in the Middle Ages and was the world's 
most famous outlaw." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is a believer. 
</P>
<P>
"Men just don't get up and write stories like that . . . there must be some 
link (to fact)," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Hood is the bowman hero of English ballads, some dating from at least the 
14th Century. Many of the tales portray the outlaw and his band robbing and 
killing representatives of authority. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff of Nottingham -- the town has had such a law officer since the 10th 
Century -- was his sworn enemy, representing the king and levying crown taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The office is now ceremonial, and responsibility for the local judiciary rests 
with an official called the high sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Historians note that Robin Hood ballads were the poetic expression of popular 
aspirations in England at a time of agrarian discontent. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood took a more romantic perspective, casting Douglas Fairbanks and Errol 
Flynn as the feather-capped outlaw in tights. Disney opted for a cartoon fox. 
</P>
<P>
For Robinson, the role of sheriff, replete with ceremonial chains, maces and 
robes, brings great personal satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived in Nottingham 29 years ago, he said, blacks faced some of the 
worst discrimination in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"Nottingham was one of the most racist towns," Robinson said. "When black 
people used to come, they had difficulty with housing, jobs (and) they were 
offered the worst kind of everything." 
</P>
<P>
Living in a one-room flat, he found a larger home, only to have his neighbor 
erect a wall between their houses when he saw a black man move in. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing his gold chain of office, Robinson said, "Discrimination won't die out 
completely, but we've come a long way."

ANGOLA FACING ANOTHER PERIL AS CUBAN DOCTORS LEAVE

LUBANGO, Angola 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outside Lubango pediatric hospital in southern Angola, a young woman screams, 
throws her dress over her head and flees down the street wailing. She has just 
learned of her child's death. 
</P>
<P>
Behind this small tragedy lies a little-publicized aspect of the Cuban troop 
withdrawal from Angola. Pleading insecurity, Cuban doctors are also 
withdrawing, leaving as abruptly as they arrived in 1975, and Soviet doctors 
will soon follow. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not enough experienced Angolan surgeons," a foreign medical worker 
explained, "and they fear operating, especially on children. I stand with them 
in the operating theater trying to give them confidence, but sometimes they 
hesitate too long. This child died of acute appendicitis." 
</P>
<P>
Cuban doctors and teachers have played a key role in Angola's civil 
administration. Lubango's main public hospital, which serves four provinces and 
has 200 beds, is typical. 
</P>
<P>
Its staff previously consisted of 25 Cuban doctors, 15 Soviets and three 
Angolans, two of whom were interns. 
</P>
<P>
On July 25, all the Cubans left. And the Soviet doctors will not renew their 
contracts when they run out at the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
As a stopgap measure, the government has contracted two Bulgarian doctors and 
14 Vietnamese, three of whom are acupuncturists, for Lubango. But hospital 
staff still feel incapable of treating the vast medical problems of the region, 
which include injuries from the new round of fighting between government troops 
and rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty casualties have recently been admitted, principally with flesh injuries 
from anti-personnel mines. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Constantina Furtado Machado, the clinical director of the hospital, said it 
is already in crisis because of a shortage of drugs, specialists and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We have one week's supply of antibiotics here," she said, "and our only 
analgesics are aspirin." 
</P>
<P>
The health problems of Lubango, stemming from the debilitating effects of a war 
economy, arise from the lack of a clean water supply, malnutrition 
(contributing to the wide incidence of cardiac congestion) and tropical 
illnesses such as malaria and dysentery.

18 AND GROWING -- GREENPEACE COMES OF AGE AS ECOLOGICAL CONCERNS RISE 
</P>

<P>
When 12 nature lovers painted "Greenpeace" on a rickety boat in 1971 and set 
sail to halt U.S. underground nuclear arms tests on a Pacific Ocean island, it 
was considered eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years and scores of dramatic stunts later, Greenpeace is a robust 
organization at the forefront of environmental protection with a $75-million 
annual budget, 3 million members and offices in 21 nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Respectability worries me," said Steve Sawyer, executive director of 
Greenpeace International. "We have to be sure not to lose our cutting edge." 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace moved its headquarters from London to Amsterdam this summer. The 
change, prompted by lower office rents, comes at a time when the organization 
is changing directions. 
</P>
<P>
With politicians rushing to show their environmental credentials, Greenpeace's 
role is shifting from maverick to responsible monitor in the fight to conserve 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, no one knew what PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) were. Now all 
you have to do is say: 'There's this ship with nasty things aboard it,' and 
people don't want it in their port. We don't have to blockade it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The dramatic actions we were once known for aren't always necessary these days 
to bring things to people's attention. Sometimes we can just point a finger and 
it's enough," Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skillful Use of Media 
</P>
<P>
The greater public awareness of pollution and environmental hazards is in part 
a tribute to the efforts of Greenpeace, which has skillfully used the media to 
advertise its cause. 
</P>
<P>
An increasingly large part of Greenpeace's budget goes to lobbying governments, 
the European Community and international organizations to take measures to 
protect the environment -- and the organization now finds its ideas gain wide 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a hard-won battle. Over the years, Greenpeace activists, often 
accompanied by camera crews or reporters, have risked arrest and even death. 
</P>
<P>
They have weaved rubber dinghies alongside whaling vessels to stop the harpoons 
of hunters, scaled industrial chimneys to draw attention to polluters, chained 
themselves to nuclear waste dumping chutes and sprayed baby seals with green 
dye to prevent them from being killed for their white fur. 
</P>
<P>
For years they have been a thorn to industrial polluters and governments 
testing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ship Bombed and Sunk 
</P>
<P>
Just how much of a thorn became clear in July, 1985, when the Greenpeace vessel 
Rainbow Warrior was blown up by French secret agents in New Zealand for 
protesting against French nuclear testing. A photographer on board drowned when 
the boat sank. 
</P>
<P>
The attack only helped boost Greenpeace's fame. 
</P>
<P>
But the organization has not grown complacent. "There are still a lot of things 
that need to be brought to people's attention," Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace still carries out its dramatic operations -- a revamped Rainbow 
Warrior is to sail to the Pacific soon. 
</P>
<P>
But it is also trying to expand operations. It has begun making inroads in the 
Third World, setting up an office in Argentina in 1987 and Costa Rica in 1988. 
It hopes to create a branch in Brazil, and it would like to open a Moscow 
office. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of its funding still goes to projects involving its seven vessels. 
But 15% goes to lobbying and information campaigns and 10% to research, usually 
farmed out to consultants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Key Issues 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, the organization has decided to concentrate its efforts on 
preservation of the Antarctic and to pressing for nuclear free seas. 
</P>
<P>
In August, it unsuccessfully tried to block testing of the U.S. Trident 
submarine. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to start a campaign on this issue in 1987 because it was a part of 
the arms race which was out of the public eye. It was not under international 
control, and the scope for accidents is great," Sawyer explained. 
</P>
<P>
"People have to realize that the INF (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) Treaty 
doesn't mean much if the missiles pulled out of Germany, the Netherlands and 
the United Kingdom go on submarines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the Antarctic, Greenpeace saw a chance to be a major actor in preserving 
humankind's last wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
"The Antarctic needs to be saved from exploitation of its mineral reserves. We 
had a sense that perhaps we could get in and save it before it got screwed up 
by humans," Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Antarctic has a major impact on the world's weather and, its preservation 
is also important for base-line environmental impact studies, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace has set up a base camp in the Antarctic -- the only non-governmental 
group to do so -- to monitor the area. 
</P>
<P>
It also plans to intensify its fight against pollution of the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
It continues in its more traditional fields -- fighting for the preservation of 
sea animals and alerting the public to toxic chemicals and nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer is convinced that in the long run, Greenpeace's message that people must 
change their ways to preserve the Earth will get across. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment has to rise to the No. 1 issue on the world agenda. It's 
getting there," he said.

AT 87, IRASCIBLE MARYLAND LAWYER MAKES A GOOD CASE AS PUBLIC DEFENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When people talk about Maryland's public defender, the same adjectives keep 
cropping up: Irascible. Irreverent. Independent. Acerbic. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven-year-old Alan H. Murrell is, say friends and foes alike, a unique 
individualist. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the antithesis, in a sense, of a bureaucrat," said Robert C. Murphy, 
chief judge of Maryland's highest court, the Court of Appeals. He calls Murrell 
irreverent and independent, and said: "No matter how important you are, Alan 
doesn't take that into account." 
</P>
<P>
"He insults these people with a fair degree of panache and disdain. He treats 
them like blathering idiots," said defense lawyer T. Joseph Touhey Jr., who 
worked with Murrell in the early years of the public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recalls Incident 
</P>
<P>
Touhey recalls the time a lawyer, hearing someone say something behind him, 
complained that Murrell had called him a name. "Alan says to the judge, 'Your 
honor, I said no such thing. He may have been reading my mind, however.' " 
</P>
<P>
Murrell, who is responsible for providing legal services for more than 100,000 
people each year, routinely overspends his budget. When lawmakers chide him, he 
says he will spend whatever he has to and that is all there is to it. 
</P>
<P>
When they suggest he retire, his response is: "I'm the last person in the world 
who would resign under that kind of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
As chief of a system that will spend $27 million this year to defend clients 
even he calls "the bottom of the barrel of humanity," Murrell knows his is not 
a popular job. "I understand how the public feels," he said. "My house has been 
broken into three times." 
</P>
<P>
But as public defender since the office was created in 1971, he believes he 
owes allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees that the more than 
100,000 men and women whose cases flow through his offices each year have a 
right to the best possible defense when they walk into a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get pleasure out of representing these people," he said, adding that 
without his agency, there would be chaos in the courts. "The private bar can't 
begin to handle . . . the indigent accused." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not 'Fanatical' 
</P>
<P>
While Murrell speaks eloquently of rights, Touhey said he is not "some sort of 
fanatical constitutional spouting type. That's just not Alan. He'll do the job 
because that's what he was retained to do." 
</P>
<P>
Murrell's major problem with the Legislature involves his budget. He says he 
spends more than he gets because he does not get enough. Critics, such as state 
Sens. Laurence Levitan and Julian Lapides, say he is a poor manager of money. 
</P>
<P>
It was the dispute over money that prompted calls for his retirement, which 
Murrell easily dismisses. "I get cursed and kicked around and batted from 
pillar to post. I can't say it has much impact on me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to step down on the commands of Levitan and poor old Jack 
Lapides. Either one of those two bums couldn't find his way into a courtroom 
with a Seeing Eye dog." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He's a Character' 
</P>
<P>
Murphy believes such comments hurt Murrell, but Lapides and Levitan say that is 
not true. "I think his irascibility is marvelous," Lapides said. "We all know 
he's a character." Told of Murrell's comment about the Seeing Eye dog, he 
replied: "I think that's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who rates Murrell as one of the best criminal lawyers in the country 
with "a magnificent courtroom presence," remembers when Murrell, 
cross-examining a police officer, suggested that the crime lab employee 
"couldn't find an olive in a martini glass." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Murrell will turn 88 two days after Christmas, no one suggests that 
he retire because of his age. "When you're 87, you tend to lose a step. Alan 
has done that, and I think he'd agree," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, Murrell "is still a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Murrell says he will not think about retiring until the office is on a sound 
financial footing. Only in the last two years, under Gov. William Donald 
Schaefer, has he gotten funds to handle his caseload; now he has to pay off 
past deficits.

AMERICANS, SOVIETS PLAN JOINT PARK, WILDLIFE PRESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN WALKER, The Guardian 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A joint U.S. and Soviet national park and wilderness preserve is being planned 
for the land on both sides of the Bering Straits, where Siberia and Alaska are 
only 80 miles apart. It has already been dubbed the "Glasnost and Glaciers" 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Ecologists and park officials in both countries have agreed that the region is 
best treated as an ecological whole, and that joint management of the area is 
the best way to protect the wildlife and the wilderness and to guard against 
pollution, including oil spills, in this fragile environment, where winter ends 
in early May and resumes at the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
This human attempt to see the region as a whole echoes the geological past, 
when the Asian and American continents were joined by a land bridge across the 
Bering Straits, across which America's first human inhabitants are believed to 
have migrated. 
</P>
<P>
Although the boundaries for the park have yet to be drawn up, and plans for 
tourist access and management rules are in the early stages, enthusiastic 
scientists from both countries are planning joint research programs into 
migration patterns and breeding zones. 
</P>
<P>
The only access to this region is by dog sled, boat, four-wheel drive, 
helicopter or float plane. But in spite of the remoteness, reminders of the 
modern world are near enough, in the U.S. military base and radar station at 
Nome, and in the matching array of Soviet security installations in Magadan 
Province. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Single Ecosystem' 
</P>
<P>
"The Bering Sea happens to be divided by a political boundary, but it should be 
recognized and managed as a single ecosystem," said Curtis Bohlen, a vice 
president of the World Wildlife Fund, and one of the promoters of the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. contribution to the venture is expected to be a large part of the Nome 
Peninsula known as the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve. The Soviet Union 
has a series of ecologically protected zones, rather than a formal national 
park service, but Soviet ecologists have lately been examining the U.S. and the 
British national park systems to see which best suits their conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent spur to this cooperation on the roof of the world was the 
Alaska oil spill disaster, when a purpose-built oil-skimming Russian ship was 
sent to help clear up the 11 million gallons of crude oil that gushed from the 
Exxon Valdez supertanker. 
</P>
<P>
With further oil exploration already going on off Alaska's Barrow Peninsula, 
and with the Soviets starting to drill in their own Arctic coastal zones, 
concern about more oil pollution has intensified the contacts between U.S. and 
Soviet ecologists. 
</P>
<P>
Although the idea of an Arctic park was first raised in the 1960s, U.S.-Soviet 
cooperation in this neighborly Arctic region has progressed with remarkable 
speed since the coming of glasnost. Earlier this year, U.S. and Soviet 
officials agreed that the Inuit natives of both sides would be allowed to come 
and go without bothering with the tedious formalities of bureaucratic 
civilization such as visas. An Alaskan airline now flies a regular service back 
and forth to the Siberian town of Providenya. 
</P>
<P>
And in this Alaska territory, which was a province of the Czar's Empire until 
it was sold for hard cash in the 1860s, Soviet architectural historians have 
begun helping with the restoration of old Russian Orthodox churches.

STEVEN STAYNER, 24, KIDNAPED AS BOY, DIES IN MOTORCYCLE CRASH

Steven Stayner, who as a child was kidnaped from his Merced home and held 
captive until he escaped seven years later, died Saturday in a motorcycle 
accident, a coroner's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Stayner, 24, was pronounced dead at Merced Community Medical Center shortly 
after the 5:30 p.m. accident outside a meat company on Santa Fe Avenue between 
Merced and Atwater, a coroner's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
No other details were immediately available, according to the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Stayner, the subject of an NBC miniseries in May, lived as the son of his 
abductor, Kenneth Parnell, a convicted child molester. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, at the age of 7, Stayner was kidnaped while walking home from school. 
When Stayner was 14, Parnell kidnaped another boy, 5-year-old Timmy White. 
Stayner later escaped, taking Timmy with him. 
</P>
<P>
Parnell was convicted of two counts of kidnaping and sentenced to eight years 
and eight months in prison in February, 1982, after an 18-day trial in Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
Stayner recently talked candidly with reporters of his life with Parnell, who 
alternately molested him and passed him off as his son. For seven years, as the 
two moved around Mendocino and Sonoma counties, Stayner was known as Dennis 
Parnell. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Stayner married Jody Edmondson in Atwater, where the two were living 
with their two children at the time of his death.

NAVAJOS HAVE NO RESERVATIONS ON LATEST IN DIGITAL COMPUTER PHONES 
</P>

CHINLE, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Navajos' disdain of community living has long given fits to an industry whose 
trademark is poles stretching to the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Where people live close together, the traditional telephone system works fine, 
but when they are scattered most companies can't justify the cost, said Francis 
Mike, general manager of Navajo Communications Co. "Navajos don't live in large 
clusters. They live miles apart." 
</P>
<P>
For Suzie Randall, that meant a 12-mile trek from her home in Nazlini to Chinle 
every two to three weeks for the last 21 years to call her daughters in Denver 
and Ft. Defiance, followed by a 12-mile return trip. 
</P>
<P>
The old days and the new now meet at the 79-year-old Randall's one-room house. 
Sheepskins dry in a shade house out front. Hugging the back wall, looking like 
a giant mushroom beside an inverted carrot, are a satellite dish for TV 
reception and a box-like transceiver for Ultraphone, a system that is bringing 
telephone service to the Navajos using radio instead of cables, for about 
one-eighth the cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wyoming System 
</P>
<P>
International Mobile Machines Corp. of Philadelphia began working on what would 
become Ultraphone in 1981. Its first installation was in September of 1986, for 
Mountain Bell in the Douglas, Wyo., area. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Federal Communications Commission decided that the time had 
come for radio to improve rural phone service, organized a Basic Exchange 
Telecommunications Radio Service and allocated frequency channels to it. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty companies or groups are investigating or have installed Ultraphone from 
St. Lawrence County, N.Y., to the sparsely populated Southwest, Mike said. 
Navajo Communications introduced it in November on the 25,000-square-mile 
reservation, a West Virginia-sized area that is home to 175,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Now, demand exceeds supply, he said. Navajos are "up on technology. They all 
have television, and now they'd like phones. They're coming in here and saying: 
'We want telephone service now.' " 
</P>
<P>
The key to Ultraphone is digital radio technology, using an encoder to convert 
voices into the computer, or binary, language for transmission as a radio 
signal. Beamed to a tower atop a mesa nine miles from Chinle, the signal is 
relayed to destination, where it is decoded by a transceiver. Users converse 
over standard telephones -- the magic is in the means, not the end. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
37 1/2-Mile Radius 
</P>
<P>
The signal covers a circle with a radius of 37 1/2 miles, so customers have the 
benefit of being able to make a 75-mile local call. Bills run $15 to $23 per 
month for basic service, Mike said. 
</P>
<P>
That presents a unique challenge for Cecil Jones, Navajo Communications' Chinle 
service area manager, whose job runs the gamut from marketing to helping 
customers make out checks to pay for the service. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to sit down and explain what a telephone bill is," he said. "It's very 
educational for us, really something we need to do as a person. The other thing 
is to explain to them the capabilities of the equipment -- the difference 
between a local call and long distance." 
</P>
<P>
Navajo Communications has invested about $750,000 in the system, which 
currently has about 100 customers of 460 possible. Jones estimated that it 
would cost at least $6 million to run wires into the same clusters of 
dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to cover most of the reservation -- most of northeastern 
Arizona and parts of Utah and New Mexico -- with installations in its three 
other service areas, based in Window Rock and Tuba City, Ariz., and Shiprock, 
N.M. 
</P>
<P>
Ultraphone is the only digital system on the market, said IMM spokeswoman 
Marcia Bexley. It offers improved transmission quality and the ability to 
time-divide a radio channel to allow four simultaneous conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing is spectrum efficiency. We make the most out of the radio 
spectrum," Bexley said. 
</P>
<P>
"It relates to the cost, because in radio, channels are the cost," said IMM 
regional director Kris Shelton in Denver, who added that the digital format 
ensures privacy. "With a normal mobile radio, you can sit with a broadcast 
scanner and listen in; with digital, all you hear is a hissing sound." 
</P>
<P>
But spectrum efficiency, signal splitting and security aren't the important 
things to Suzie Randall. "I really like the service and it's a communication I 
have with my kids," she said in Navajo, translated by Jones. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem, she said, is neighbors who have no phones turning up with 
increasing frequency to make calls.

O. ERTESZEK, 73; LINGERIE QUEEN OF OLGA CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olga Erteszek, who came to Los Angeles with $10 in her pocket and became the 
queen of ladies' lingerie, died Friday of cancer in her Brentwood home. She was 
73. 
</P>
<P>
Erteszek, renowned for her innovative designs, was the first woman to receive 
the California Industrialist of the Year award when she and her husband, Jan, 
were honored in 1985 for lifetime contributions to the state's businesses and 
manufacturing. Many of her lingerie designs were awarded patents for their 
originality. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Krakow, Poland, Erteszek came to Los Angeles in 1941 with her husband, 
and together they used their only $10 to rent a sewing machine and buy fabric 
to produce her first garter belt samples. Although they spoke little English, 
they were able to sell an order for two dozen to Bullocks Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
From that start, the Olga Co. became an industry giant, offering 150 garment 
designs in 2,000 variations of style and color. The company generated $67 
million in yearly sales and had 1,800 employees before it was sold to Warnaco 
Inc. in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Erteszek is survived by three daughters, Christina Johnson, Victoria Foote and 
Mary Rudolph, and four grandchildren. Her husband died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service has been scheduled for 2 p.m. Wednesday at Forest Lawn 
Memorial Park in Glendale.

NEW PROGRAM HELPS RAISE MONEY FOR CARE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENTALISTS LET 'FOSTER PARENTS' ADOPT BIRDS, ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TARA BRADLEY-STECK, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donna Castle's fourth-graders in Milford, Pa., have adopted an injured 
red-tailed hawk named the Red Baroness. Nine-year-old Stephen Raba thinks of 
the hawk as his own. 
</P>
<P>
"He talks about it all the time, about his bird. He takes it personally," said 
his mother, Lynne Raba. "When some of the class went to see it, he was adamant 
that he had to go, that it was so important. It's something that he takes a lot 
of pride in." 
</P>
<P>
The students at Dingman Delaware Elementary School recycled $25 worth of 
aluminum cans to adopt the bird for one month at a nearby rehabilitation center 
for injured and orphaned birds of prey. The children are hoping they can keep 
the Red Baroness on the mend until she's ready to be released into the wild. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, financial foster parents are being sought for a manatee in Florida, 
baby puffins off the coast of Maine and California gray whales in the Pacific 
Ocean. A Pennsylvania trout stream can be adopted for an investment of labor, 
as can a Texas beach and an Arkansas highway. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, environmental groups are offering "adoption" plans for wild 
birds and animals, their habitats and open spaces as a way to raise money 
anywhere nature is in trouble. The groups say more and more people are adopting 
the wild through contributions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hands-On' Effort 
</P>
<P>
"It's hands-on. It's strong and it's powerful," says Pat Noonan of the 
Conservation Fund in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"The environmental movement is trying to reach out in creative ways to enlist 
volunteer support and involvement, and adopt-a-tree and adopt-a-whale are 
things people can identify with." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Bates of the Whale Center in Oakland, Calif., one of several 
organizations offering whales for adoption, says: "It's a gimmick, a hook, 
because everybody is hurting, everybody needs money. After you donate to a 
couple of organizations, chances are your mailbox is going to be inundated, so 
you want to be the one piece of mail folks will not throw out." 
</P>
<P>
Zoos and aviaries often sponsor adoption programs for both special projects and 
general upkeep, says Charles Wickenhauser of the Pittsburgh Zoo, which recently 
raised $6,500 to build a new penguin exhibit through a "penguin parents" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the generation of baby boomers has less of a giving tradition than our 
parents did," he says. "We're trying to find the trigger for their giving and 
trying to find it in nontraditional ways -- what unlocks the purse." 
</P>
<P>
Adoption rates range from $10 to hundreds of dollars. The money is used either 
directly -- to buy housing, medical care and food for the adoptee -- or 
indirectly, to subsidize research, species preservation, educational programs 
or lobby efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, foster parents usually receive a glossy photograph and description 
of their animal, occasional updates about its comings and goings and, just like 
Cabbage Patch dolls, a certificate of adoption. 
</P>
<P>
But adoptions don't work for all environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have something that's there and identifiable, that you can 
photograph and put a name on," says Craig van Note of Monitor Consortium of 
Conservation and Animal Welfare Organizations in Washington D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you can really adopt an elephant in Africa. In a case like 
that, you'd have to tell the people their elephant got killed last week, and 
that would be a downer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Florida Manatees 
</P>
<P>
A Florida native, Debra Brown, 33, of Orlando, was accustomed to seeing 
manatees swimming in the state's shallow rivers. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until she received an appeal to adopt "Boomer" that she became 
passionately involved in saving the gentle and fragile animals, most of whom 
bear scars from boat propellers. 
</P>
<P>
"If something happened to Boomer, you'd probably find me in tears," she says. 
"As big and, quote, ugly as manatees are, they're beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Save The Manatee Club of Maitland, Fla., began offering adoptions in 
1984, officials say membership has grown from 800 to 20,000 adults and about 
60,000 students -- 80,000 foster parents in all trying to save a species whose 
population has dwindled to about 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
"Boomer is a manatee who's special to a lot of people now and if something 
happens to Boomer, there are a lot of people who are going to be upset," says 
club director Judith Delaney Vallee. "It's now their manatee." 
</P>
<P>
Adoptions have become the lifeblood of many organizations, which have been 
scrambling for funds since many charitable donations were declared no longer 
tax-deductible. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to whale adoptions, the Massachusetts-based International Wildlife 
Coalition, which monitors several endangered species, has grown from three 
employees in 1983 to 22 now. In the past year, the group sent out 86,000 
humpback whale adoptions for $15 each, 50,000 of which were Christmas gifts. 
</P>
<P>
"Our files grow faster than we can keep up with," says coalition official 
Margaret King. "People will send it as a gift to someone else -- it's a great 
stocking stuffer. And it crosses all barriers and countries. We have people in 
Saudi Arabia, France, Australia who have adopted whales." 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six humpback whales that migrate yearly to the Cape Cod area can be 
adopted. Individual whales are identified by unique white and gray marks on 
their tails, so foster parents receive a photograph of their whale's tail as it 
breaches the water.

BAPTIST CHURCH WORKS TO BRING CULTURES TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It began with Baptist refugees from Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
They settled into the neighborhood around Fullerton First Baptist Church about 
40 years ago, then began spreading their faith to Mexican and other Latin 
American immigrants in the barrio nearby. Eventually, the Spanish-speaking 
congregation there grew to more than 100, requiring a pastor and Sunday service 
of its own. 
</P>
<P>
This presented a dilemma for Senior Pastor Sam Hochstatter. 
</P>
<P>
Like most churches in the county, Fullerton First Baptist began, as one member 
put it, "a normal white-bread church." And some members at first were unused 
to, and in some cases intolerant of, the growing Latino congregation sharing 
their church, Hochstatter said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All-Too-Rare Solution 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, in what civil rights leaders see as an all-too-rare solution to a 
common problem in scores of Orange County churches, Hochstatter and Jose 
Arreguin, pastor of the Hispanic department, are taking steps to help the two 
congregations share activities and build relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Three bilingual seminars on differences and common ground between the church's 
English- and Spanish-speaking ministries are being held. One was held last week 
and the others are set for Wednesday of this week and next at the church, 212 
E. Wilshire Ave. in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
A combined worship service also was to be held today to coincide with Hispanic 
Heritage Week in the American Baptist Church, Hochstatter said. The 
congregation has held combined services a few times each year for the last few 
years, he added. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the pastors said they will launch an unusual fund-raising 
campaign for a bilingual weekly radio talk show with Anglo and Latino Christian 
themes. They hope to broadcast the program beginning in January to Orange, Los 
Angeles and San Bernardino counties. (Arreguin also broadcasts a short-wave 
radio program, "Una Palabra al Corazon" -- "A Word to the Heart" -- from KVOH 
radio in Van Nuys to Latin America.) 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, it was unclear whether the congregations would be able to 
accept each other, said Arreguin, 72, a native of Mexico who graduated from the 
USC School of Theology and obtained a doctorate at the University of Strasbourg 
in France. 
</P>
<P>
Arreguin, who joined the church about 10 years ago, started a fund-raising 
campaign and began seeking a separate church site, but he soon discovered that 
moving would be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unity Is Answer 
</P>
<P>
It was then, about five years ago, that the pastors decided it would be best 
for the congregations to try to unite. 
</P>
<P>
Hochstatter looked, he said, but could found no other "multiethnic model" in 
Orange County for integrating a church. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission, said that nearly 100 churches in the county are so-called "nesting 
churches" -- that is, they either rent or give space to an ethnic minority 
congregation. But Kennedy said most of those churches have "squandered" the 
opportunity to build intergroup relationships. 
</P>
<P>
In Protestant nesting churches, Kennedy said, "many have begun their 
relationships with the desire to do things together, but most have had a 
difficult time living up to that ideal." Some churchgoers, he said, have 
expressed hostility over such matters as the smell of the minority groups' 
food, their attitudes in regard to church maintenance and contributing toward 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, the host churches asked the other congregation to move on or 
they upped the rent," he said, or they "continue in a situation where there's 
not (an) interchange." 
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, there were not good structures for communication," Kennedy 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic parishes, in particular, have been struggling with changes in 
demography, Kennedy said. Veteran parishioners have argued over such changes as 
adding Masses in Spanish, whether the Spanish-language Mass would be at a more 
desirable time than the English-language ones, and whether such services would 
be in the main sanctuary or in a hall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some segregation is needed initially, so everyone can understand the language 
of worship," Kennedy said. But "the ideal situation is, like children learning 
English in school, you have time with your own language group . . . and other 
times when you can be bilingual and share activities with" the English-speaking 
group. 
</P>
<P>
At Fullerton First Baptist, the Latino service led by Arreguin begins Sundays 
at 9 a.m., with the Anglo service led by Hochstatter at 10:35. (A Vietnamese 
congregation of about 50 Protestants also rents a room at the church but is not 
included in the seminars because it belongs to a different denomination, 
Arreguin said.) 
</P>
<P>
For at least 10 years, the two groups have mingled in "alley parties" between 
services, and in youth clubs and nursery and athletic facilities. Latino 
children, who are mostly bilingual, attend Sunday school in English and sing in 
the choir. 
</P>
<P>
Arreguin said he believes the Latinos will stay in the church "as long as the 
Anglo congregation is willing to help us stay." 
</P>
<P>
While most of the 650 or so Anglo church members have been receptive, a few 
families quit the church about 1 1/2 years ago, Hochstatter said. "They did not 
like differences. . . . It was too threatening. Too frightening." 
</P>
<P>
The pastor said he has preached to his congregation that if it could not learn 
to live together, it would have to "turn the church over to the Hispanics and 
call ourselves the First Baptist Church of someplace else. Maybe Palm Springs. 
That's where the white flight is going." 
</P>
<P>
More important, Hochstatter said, he believes the Gospel challenges Christians 
to understand one another. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand why people who call themselves Christians can't be together 
to celebrate Christ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One member of the Fullerton church, Ricardo Vergara, 32, an immigrant from 
Chile who now lives in Diamond Bar, said the seminars will be important. 
</P>
<P>
"You get to ask about what the other culture thinks about things," Vergara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, being together helps break down stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
"If they hear me speak Spanish, they might think I clean hotels," said Vergara, 
who is a sales representative. "We have people in our congregation who are 
engineers and doctors." 
</P>
<P>
Formality is one of the differences between the two congregations that the 
pastors say they hope to explore at the seminars. 
</P>
<P>
"Anglos tend to be more formal," Arreguin said. "They look to order as (a) main 
principle of social life. We . . . are more spontaneous. That probably 
frightens some Anglos. They make us nervous -- they put everything on a 
calendar. We keep it in our heads." 
</P>
<P>
At both Anglo and Latino services, worshipers sing the formal, New 
England-style hymns used by the American Baptist congregation. But in the 
evening service for the Latino congregation, Arreguin said, "we play the guitar 
and the trumpet. We clap our hands." 
</P>
<P>
Because only 20% of the Latino congregation is bilingual, neither pastor is 
pushing for a joint congregation at this time.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTELOPE VALLEY MAN SLAIN IN ARGUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An argument at a boardinghouse in the Lake Los Angeles area of the northern 
Antelope Valley ended in the stabbing death of a 32-year-old male tenant early 
Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives, was 
stabbed once in the upper chest about 3 a.m. at a boardinghouse in the 39000 
block of 182nd Street East, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy George 
Ducoulombier. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies on Saturday were searching for Robert Brian Blazer, 30, in connection 
with the killing. Authorities said Blazer, who rented a room next to the 
victim, stabbed him with an unknown object before fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was declared dead at the scene. Ducoulombier said deputies had not 
yet determined a motive for the killing.

UCLA ESCAPES SAN DIEGO STATE; 
</P>
<P>
BRUINS WIN, 28-25, ON SNEAK BY JOHNSON WITH 2:39 LEFT 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those who regularly ignore the annual warning statements from UCLA football 
Coach Terry Donahue, listen carefully. 
</P>
<P>
If he says the sky is falling, believe him this time. His Bruins truly are 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA needed a one-yard touchdown by quarterback Bret Johnson with 2:39 left 
Saturday night to earn a 28-25 comeback victory over San Diego State before 
31,639 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The escape against the Aztecs (0-2) came one week after the Bruins were upset 
in their opener by Tennessee, 24-6. This game was supposed to provide an 
opportunity for the 20th-ranked Bruins (1-1) to regain some confidence before 
their game Saturday against No. 2 Michigan in the Rose Bowl. Instead the Bruins 
came within a desperation touchdown drive of losing to the Aztecs for the first 
time in the history of the 13-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Only the poise of Johnson and running of tailback Brian Brown stood between the 
Bruins and their first 0-2 start in 18 years. Johnson completed two passes for 
35 yards in the drive and Brown rushed for 16 yards in six carries. 
</P>
<P>
"Say what you will, but our football team had a chance to fold in the fourth 
quarter," Donahue said. "We had a redshirt freshman at quarterback, and we went 
down and scored. That was the most encouraging thing of the whole day for me." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's touchdown came a little more than four minutes after running back 
Darrin Wagner's 31-yard touchdown run had given the Aztecs a 25-21 lead. The 
touchdown capped a nine-play, 57-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a quarterback sneak, not much to it," said Johnson, who was 15 of 
27 for 262 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. "The way their 
defense was set up, there was nobody over the center. They wanted their 
linebacker to dive over and stop us. I got my body and my shoulders low and 
went right in." 
</P>
<P>
But while the comeback was encouraging to Donahue, the game again pointed out 
what Donahue has been contending about this Bruin team for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said all along that this team is not as strong as others I've had in the 
past," Donahue said. "Last year (against San Diego State) we were up, 31-0, at 
the half with Troy Aikman at quarterback. This year's team is different. It's 
still growing; it's still trying to develop its own spirit, its own 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
If there were any question that some other UCLA team would show up other than 
the one that lost to Tennessee the week before, it was dispelled early. 
</P>
<P>
All it took was a 73-yard run for a touchdown on a fake punt by senior nickel 
back John Wesselman to give the Aztecs a 7-0 lead with 3:49 left in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for a first down," San Diego State Coach Al Luginbill said, 
"but John broke it for us and set the momentum for the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since this 67-year-old series was resumed in 1984 that 
San Diego State led in a game. The run was a warning that this game would be 
closer to UCLA's 18-15 victory in 1984 than the lopsided UCLA victories of the 
next four years. 
</P>
<P>
In the early going, the Bruins looked like anything but the top 20 team they 
are. They struggled to take a 14-10 halftime lead against a San Diego State 
team that had lost, 52-36, at Air Force on Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
This also was the same Aztec program, although not the same team, that the 
Bruins had beaten the past three years by a combined score of 151-34. But 
regardless of whatever improvement the Aztecs showed this time, the Bruins 
demonstrated that many of their problems were of their own doing. 
</P>
<P>
They again had difficulty defensively. They were outgained, 437-425. They 
yielded 234 yards to the Aztecs in the first half; that was as many as the 
Bruins gave up to the Aztecs in their entire 59-6 victory in the Rose Bowl last 
year. And unlike past years, when they were able to physically overmatch the 
Aztecs on both lines, San Diego State held its own up front. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew going in we could compete with these guys," Aztec quarterback Dan 
McGwire said. "We're physical, and it showed tonight." 
</P>
<P>
This was a much more brazen Aztec team than the Bruins were used to playing. 
Luginbill, in only his second game as a major college head coach, was not 
afraid to gamble on big plays. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of these kids and tonight everybody saw why," Luginbill said. "I see 
it in practice every day." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins appeared ready to exert their traditional dominance of the Aztecs 
midway through the first quarter, starting a long drive that took them deep 
into San Diego State territory. But the drive ended abruptly with an 
interception, and the Aztecs then turned to a touch of trickery. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA had moved to the Aztec 27 when Johnson attempted to complete a pass to 
Brown. But the ball was high and Brown could only tip it over his head and into 
the hands of San Diego State cornerback Clark Moses at the Aztec 17. 
</P>
<P>
Moses returned the ball five yards to the San Diego State 22. The drive stalled 
after three plays netted five yards, and the Aztecs went into punt formation. 
But instead of snapping the ball to punter Joe Santos, the ball was snapped to 
the short man, Wesselman. 
</P>
<P>
Wesselman, a senior from West Torrance High School, took the snap and dashed 
around the right side untouched. He eluded Shawn Wills, who had been set up as 
the return man, at the UCLA 45 and then outraced strong safety Mark McGill to 
the end zone for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins wasted little time responding. They went on their longest drive of 
the game, moving 79 yards in eight plays to tie the score, 7-7, on a 38-yard 
pass to flanker Scott Miller from Johnson with 12 seconds left in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins went ahead, 14-7, on their next possession. This time they went 71 
yards in 10 plays, the drive ending on a one-yard dive by freshman tailback 
Kevin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown drive put the Bruins ahead for the first time, but it had a 
price. Wills suffered a sprained right ankle midway through the drive and did 
not return. Wills, who led the Bruins with 62 yards in 11 carries against 
Tennessee, had 29 yards in four carries against the Aztecs. His departure left 
Brown to carry the rushing load. 
</P>
<P>
Brown finished with 99 yards in 32 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs tried their second gamble on the next series. Faced with a 
fourth-and-one at the UCLA 21, the Aztecs not only elected to go for a first 
down rather than attempt would have been a 38-yard field goal, they tried to 
gain the yardage through the air. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire attempted a pass to Jimmy Raye near the left front of the end zone, but 
Matt Darby stepped in to make the interception and end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bruins could do nothing with that bit of good fortune and the Aztecs 
took over at their 40 with 2:56 left in the half after a 52-yard punt by Kirk 
Maggio. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs went into their two-minute offense, driving for a fourth-and-one to 
the UCLA nine with 10 seconds left. The Aztecs used their last time out to set 
up for a 26-yard field goal by Andy Trakas that cut the lead to 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had a chance in the third quarter to again go ahead by a touchdown, 
but Alfredo Velasco's 42-yard field goal attempt with 10:54 left was low and 
was blocked at the line by lineman Brad Burton. 
</P>
<P>
The third quarter ended scoreless, but that was only because the clock ran out 
two plays before the Bruins could add their third touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But like most else in the game, this did not come easy for the Bruins. They 
needed two tries from less than a yard away before Williams finally went around 
the left side for his second touchdown and a 21-10 lead at 14:18. 
</P>
<P>
The first attempt ended with fullback Maury Toy being stopped as he attempted 
to crash the middle of the line. The second was successful but only because of 
the persistence of Williams, a freshman from Spring, Tex. He tried the left 
side, and when he found no opening, he kept sliding farther outside, eventually 
getting past two Aztec defenders and into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
But the Aztecs would not go away. They drove 74 yards in 10 plays on their next 
possession, ending when Wagner slipped around the right side for a one-yard 
touchdown run with 11:24 to play. 
</P>
<P>
The gambler in Luginbill came out again on the conversion, but not before a 
momentary mix-up. Luginbill apparently wanted to try for a two-point conversion 
but before the team could get the word, Trakas attempted a conversion kick 
while McGwire was running on the field and the Aztecs were penalized for too 
many men on the field. But the penalty turned out to be the break the Aztecs 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
That gave them a second chance to get McGwire on the field. And this time he 
completed the two-point pass to Raye in the end zone. That brought the Aztecs 
to 21-18. 
</P>
<P>
But safety Morey Paul and Wagner would combine a few minutes later to give them 
more than that. 
</P>
<P>
On the third play after Wagner's touchdown, Paul intercepted the second Johnson 
pass of the game at the San Diego State 47. 
</P>
<P>
At first, it appeared as if the Aztecs would not benefit; a holding penalty and 
sack forced them into a third-and-31 at their 27. But McGwire connected on a 
30-yard pass to wide receiver Dennis Arey on third down. And then another Aztec 
gamble paid off when McGwire rushed for a first down on a fourth-and-one to 
keep the drive alive at the UCLA 42. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Wagner dashed down the right side for his second touchdown 
-- a 31-yarder that included a move that left free safety Eric Turner on his 
rump. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Aztecs a 25-21 lead and forced the final Bruin rally.

USC, ERVINS RESURRECT OFFENSE IN 66-10 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Offense? Did somebody mention USC doesn't have an offense? 
</P>
<P>
Don't say that around the Utah State Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
Criticized for their failure to score a touchdown in their season opener 
against Illinois, the Trojans took out their frustrations on Utah State before 
54,209 Saturday night at the Coliseum, rolling to a 66-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
In their biggest offensive outburst in nearly two decades, the Trojans scored 
early and often, spreading their scoring among nine players. 
</P>
<P>
They racked up 654 yards in total offense, 491 passing and 163 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
The defense was also effective, holding the Aggies to 207 yards of total 
offense, including 24 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
When it was finally over, even Traveler, the team mascot, was happy. He looked 
as if he could have used an oxygen mask after galloping around the track all 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, the Aggies figured to be overmatched, but Trojan Coach Larry Smith 
wasn't about to throw this one back. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to win a game, and I don't care who we beat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Ervins led the way with a career-high 180 yards in 15 carries and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed this one for our confidence," Ervins said. "We got the win and 
that's what matters." 
</P>
<P>
The 66 points were the most by a Trojan team since USC scored 70 against 
Washington State in 1970. It was also the most points given up by the Aggies 
since 1974, when Utah State lost to Oklahoma, 72-3. 
</P>
<P>
USC's rushing game was most maligned after the 14-13 loss to Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
No complaints Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
USC gained 491 rushing yards in 49 carries, a 10.02 average. The Pacific 10 
record (9.5 by Oregon State against Utah in 1951) is based on a minimum of 50 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Also scoring on the ground Saturday for USC were Aaron Emanuel, Leroy Holt and 
backup quarterback Shane Foley. 
</P>
<P>
Foley also threw a touchdown pass. Starter Todd Marinovich threw two. Freshman 
receiver Larry Wallace, who had never caught a pass for the Trojans, caught two 
for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich completed 10 of 18 for 92 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy when you have the time back there I had tonight," he said. "I didn't 
get touched the entire game. People doubted us after Illinois, but I knew we 
had this kind of effort in us. The numbers don't surprise me." 
</P>
<P>
Any doubts the Aggies might have about how bad it was going to be were quickly 
erased. The first time they gave the ball up, USC scored. 
</P>
<P>
After a Utah State punt, USC put together a 53-yard, eight-play drive that 
culminated with Emanuel scoring from two yards out. 
</P>
<P>
The second play of the drive gave the Aggies a clue as to just how futile this 
night would become. Ervins burst through the line for 46 yards, but the play 
was called back because of a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
No problem. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich handed off to his other back, Holt, who gained 20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a minute after their first score, the Trojans had Traveler running 
around the track again. 
</P>
<P>
On Utah State's second play from scrimmage, quarterback Kurt Johnson lofted a 
pass from his 26-yard line toward receiver Keith Roberson. 
</P>
<P>
But he lofted it much too high, over Roberson's head and into the waiting arms 
of defender Ernest Spears at the 38. With nobody between him and the end zone, 
Spears easily raced in to put USC ahead, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
A two-yard scoring run by Ervins and a 45-yard field goal by Grant Runnerstrum 
closed out the first-quarter scoring. 
</P>
<P>
It was the USC's best quarter since scoring 27 in the fourth quarter against 
Cal in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies couldn't be blamed for looking for the quickest way to the Coliseum 
tunnel. Instead, they found a way to get back in the game briefly. 
</P>
<P>
Taking over after Runnerstrum's field goal in the closing minute of the 
quarter, Utah State put together a 15-play, 60-yard drive that extended nearly 
six minutes into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With backup quarterback Kevin White leading the way, Utah State drove to the 
Trojan 16-yard line, where Russ Moody kicked a 33-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing kickoff, USC's Gary Wellman fumbled, kicker Sean Jones 
recovered, and Utah State had the ball at the Trojan 26. 
</P>
<P>
From there, it took six plays to score, the points coming on a 15-yard pass 
from White to Tracey Jenkins, who managed to grab the ball despite being 
sandwiched between Spears and Marcus Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
That made it 24-10, but Marinovich closed out the half with his first touchdown 
pass as a Trojan. The redshirt freshman hit Frank Griffin from four yards out. 
</P>
<P>
The second half was more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
Much more. 
</P>
<P>
Ervins opened it with a 78-yard run from scrimmage down the left sideline that 
took him to the Utah State 14. It was the longest run from scrimmage by a 
Trojan since Zeph Lee's 94-yard run in 1984 against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
Holt followed Ervins' big gainer two plays later with his first touchdown of 
the night, going in from three yards out. 
</P>
<P>
USC quickly got the ball back when linebacker Junior Seau wrapped an arm around 
the neck of White, forcing a fumble that was recovered by fellow linebacker 
Craig Hartsuyker. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Marinovich went to the air, hitting Wallace with a five-yard scoring 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Ervins later added his second touchdown, scoring from five yards out to boost 
the score to 52-10 heading into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys who didn't play got in and I had to let them go," Smith said, when 
asked about running up the score. "I can't put kids out there and tell them not 
to score." 
</P>
<P>
With the pent-up emotions the Trojans have been carrying around for two weeks, 
who would have listened? 
</P>
<P>
USC Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans have routed Utah State in the previous three meetings, 40-12 in 
1928, 65-0 in 1930 and 42-7 in '84. . . . Twice the Trojans have lost season 
openers, yet gone on to win a national championship. In 1931, under Coach 
Howard Jones, they lost to St. Mary's, 13-7, then won the rest of their games 
to finish 10-1. In 1974, under John McKay, USC began with a 22-7 loss to 
Arkansas, later tied Cal, 15-15, but still won a national title with a 10-1-1 
mark. In '76, under John Robinson, USC was blown out by Missouri, 46-25, in its 
first game, yet wound up second in the nation at 11-1. . . . Don Gibson, the 
starting nose guard until he went down with a knee injury in the preseason, is 
still in a brace and using crutches. Coach Larry Smith is hoping he will return 
for the last three or four games. . . . According to the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn., USC has the fourth toughest schedule. Its opponents were a 
combined 69-43-6 last season. . . . Calvin Holmes, moved from flanker to 
tailback this week, injured an ankle in the first quarter and did not return.

KICKOFF RETURNS ROCKET NOTRE DAME PAST MICHIGAN; 
</P>
<P>
TWO IN SECOND HALF BY ISMAIL FUEL IRISH, RANKED NO. 1, 24-19 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the Rocket's red glare, Notre Dame retained its ranking Saturday as the No. 
1 team in the land of the free. 
</P>
<P>
Raghib (Rocket) Ismail returned two kickoffs for second-half touchdowns, 
propelling the Fighting Irish to a 24-19 victory over No. 2-ranked Michigan 
before 105,912 in Michigan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"That may be the fastest guy I've ever seen," Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler 
said of Ismail, who scorched the Wolverines at the start of the second half and 
again in the fourth quarter after they had closed to 17-12. "He's faster than 
the speed of sound. We couldn't tackle him." 
</P>
<P>
Ismail's returns provided most of the excitement on a dark and dreary day. Rain 
fell throughout the morning and into the afternoon, leaving the artificial turf 
soggy and slippery, and Notre Dame played it safe. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish were cautious offensively and aggressive defensively. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to give Michigan anything it didn't earn," Coach Lou Holtz said 
of Notre Dame's conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish didn't, giving up no turnovers despite the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
And then they let the Rocket win the game for them. 
</P>
<P>
After a first half that ended with Notre Dame leading, 7-6, only because an 
extra-point attempt by Michigan's J.D. Carlson banged off the left upright, 
Ismail took the second-half kickoff, charged through a hole in the middle of 
the defense and sprinted down the right sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"Our front line made the initial contact and created a decent-sized crease, and 
then the back wall in front of me surged through and picked up the guys who 
were left," Ismail said of the 89-yard return. "It was nice." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame increased its lead to 17-6 later in the quarter on a 30-yard field 
goal by Craig Hentrich, but Michigan then drove 61 yards to a touchdown behind 
backup quarterback Elvis Grbac. 
</P>
<P>
Grbac, who replaced injured starter Michael Taylor midway through the third 
quarter, completed 17 of 21 passes for 134 yards and two touchdowns, but missed 
on a two-point conversion attempt with 12 minutes 58 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Michigan had rallied. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz told his players to expect a squib kick, but when Michigan kicker Gulam 
Khan booted the ball into the air, Holtz said that a player behind him on the 
sideline called out, "Oh, here we go." 
</P>
<P>
"And I thought we had a chance," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail took the kick at the eight-yard line, broke free from the grasp of Brian 
Townsend at about the 25 and raced up the left sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bigger hole this time," Ismail said, "and I saw a crease off to the 
left. I felt somebody on my leg, but then I broke free. I saw Rodney (Culver) 
level somebody, and then I saw him get back up. 
</P>
<P>
"As a return man, I'm supposed to find a crease, hit it as fast as I can, try 
to make one guy miss and take it to the house." 
</P>
<P>
Culver waved him home. 
</P>
<P>
What went through Ismail's mind when Townsend hit him? 
</P>
<P>
"You try to keep your balance, but things happen so quickly," said the 
sophomore flanker from Wilkes-Barre, Pa. "You don't think, you react." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz said the Irish use several plays on kickoff returns. 
</P>
<P>
And what do they call the two that broke Michigan's back? 
</P>
<P>
"Middle," he said. "We're not real clever." 
</P>
<P>
The name might not be clever, but the player returning the kicks is ingenious. 
Ismail, who returned a pair of kickoffs for touchdowns last season against 
Rice, has returned four for scores in a 14-game career, breaking a school 
record held by Tim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody had returned a kickoff for a touchdown against Michigan since Oct. 26, 
1957, when Ron Engel of Minnesota ran one back 95 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz said it's more than speed that sets Ismail apart. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of track men playing football," Holtz said. "Rocket Ismail is 
a football player who runs track. He runs (the ball) very well. He's got 
natural instincts and natural inclinations. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got good balance and good body lean. There are a lot of guys who run 
fast, but they run in a straight line. They don't have the awareness or the 
elusiveness or the toughness. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all seen the guys who can run really fast, but can't run far. They 
aren't what you'd call really great football players." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Ismail's obvious contributions, "probably the biggest reason for us 
getting beat was, our offensive line did not do a good job," Schembechler said. 
"Their line outquicked us, outplayed us." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame limited Michigan to 94 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense really played well, particularly our rushing defense," Holtz said. 
"Our secondary made an awful lot of critical tackles." 
</P>
<P>
Middle linebacker Ned Bolcar made one in particular, knocking the ball out of 
Taylor's hands midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame then drove 24 yards to its only offensive touchdown, quarterback 
Tony Rice completing a six-yard pass to Anthony Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
It was suggested to Ismail that spectacular touchdowns helped Brown win the 
Heisman Trophy two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Can they do the same for Ismail? 
</P>
<P>
"Not this year," he scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? 
</P>
<P>
"I said from the first day he walked out (onto the practice field) in shorts 
that he was something special," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
A nation saw for itself Saturday.

U.S., EL SALVADOR MEET TODAY IN SOCCER QUALIFIER

<TEXT>
<P>
In a game that was controversial long before it was played, the U.S. soccer 
team will face El Salvador in a World Cup qualifying match today. 
</P>
<P>
The game was switched to Honduras because of a sanction imposed on the 
Salvadorans after their home game against Costa Rica on June 25. El Salvador 
wanted to play in Los Angeles because of the large Salvadoran population there, 
but other members of the North and Central American and Caribbean zone 
protested. 
</P>
<P>
The game last June, which Costa Rica won, 4-2, was declared over with 10 
minutes left to play after fans hurled bottles and other objects onto the field 
to protest the Salvadoran team's shoddy play. 
</P>
<P>
If El Salvador wins or ties today, Costa Rica would be assured one of the 
berths to the 1990 World Cup in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is trying to earn the second berth and has four games left to 
do it. Its main challenge is from Trinidad and Tobago.

Larry Robinson, playing for the Kings for the first time since leaving the 
Montreal Canadiens to sign as a free agent, had assists on both of Kudelski's 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
Backup goalie Mario Gosselin went all the way for the Kings, stopping 33 shots. 
John Vanbiesbrouck started in goal for the Rangers, but he gave way to Bob 
Froese in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Kings will take a 1-0-1 exhibition record into their game Monday night 
against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Cleveland. That game will be televised on

WOODWARD HANDICAP AT BELMONT PARK; 
</P>
<P>
EASY GOER'S NAME CAN NO LONGER BE DRAGGED IN MUD AFTER THIS WIN

<P>
Easy Goer Saturday encountered the type of muddy track that had brought about 
his defeat twice before. This time the conditions didn't faze him. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old accelerated in the stretch to win the Woodward Handicap at 
Belmont Park by two lengths over longshot Its Acedemic. It was his fourth 
consecutive victory and moved him a step closer to the 1989 horse-of-the-year 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer had little to fear from his four rivals in this 1 1/4-mile test; but 
when morning rain made the racing strip muddy, even his trainer, Shug McGaughey 
was fretting. "I was worried about it all day," McGaughey said. "I didn't know 
how he'd do over this race track." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the trainer nor any fan could forget the colt's loss as the 1-to-5 
favorite in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last fall, or his dull second-place 
finish as the favorite in the Kentucky Derby. If he couldn't handle the mud 
Saturday he was going to be vulnerable, because the others in the field were 
able off-track performers. 
</P>
<P>
And at a couple of stages in the Woodward the favorite did look as if he might 
be ripe for an upset. 
</P>
<P>
Slew City Slew dashed to the early lead, as expected, and raced to a 
four-length lead without any real pressure. He was setting a fairly slow pace 
-- a half mile in 48 1/5 seconds -- as Its Acedemic and Forever Silver stalked 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Midway on the backstretch, both Easy Goer and Proper Reality rushed up from the 
rear of the pack and looked as if they were going to challenge for the lead. 
But Easy Goer didn't go past the leaders; instead, Its Acedemic and Forever 
Silver surged away from him. 
</P>
<P>
But jockey Pat Day wasn't worried. "We had three-eighths of a mile left, so I 
wasn't really concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Forever Silver and Its Acedemic were vying for the lead as they turned into the 
stretch, but Day angled to the outside and let the favorite roll. When he did, 
it became apparent that the outcome of the Woodward had never been in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer accelerated past the leaders with ease and won by two lengths over 
the 26-to-1 Its Acedemic, with Forever Silver another three-quarters of a 
length back in third place. Proper Reality was fourth and Slew City Slew last. 
</P>
<P>
The winner covered the 1 1/4 miles in 2:01, a time that was respectable but 
hardly sensational. Despite the mud, the track was firm enough that good 
sprinters had been able to run six furlongs in 1:09 3/5 earlier in the day. The 
time would seem to confirm the notion that Easy Goer might not be quite as 
effective on wet ground as he is on dry. 
</P>
<P>
McGaughey had been determined to run in the Woodward regardless of the 
conditions because he thought the timing of the race was ideal to prepare Easy 
Goer for his major objective, the Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park Nov. 
4. 
</P>
<P>
And while McGaughey certainly will be worrying about the ideal course for his 
horse to take in the coming weeks, but one thing he won't have to worry about 
any more is mud.

WASHINGTON STATE WINS BUT LOSES QUARTERBACK

<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Stallworth caught two touchdown passes and six Washington State defenders 
intercepted passes in a 41-3 win over Oregon State Saturday at Pullman, Wash., 
but the Cougars lost starting quarterback Brad Gossen. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed junior completed seven of eight passes for 98 yards, but left 
the game with 6:12 remaining in the first half after tearing ligaments in his 
left thumb when he hit a defender's shoulder pads following through on a pass. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to undergo surgery and miss four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars (3-0) won their Pacific-10 Conference opener for the first time 
since 1981. Oregon State slipped to 1-1 after two conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Gossen connected with Stallworth for a 44-yard touchdown on the Cougars' first 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Garcia took over and completed 10 of 13 passes for 197 yards with one 
interception, and hit Stallworth with a seven-yard touchdown strike that gave 
Washington State a 17-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona St. 28, San Jose St. 21 -- Senior tailback David Winsley caught a 
12-yard touchdown pass late in the third quarter, then scored on a 36-yard run 
early in the fourth as the Sun Devils rallied to beat the Spartans in a 
nonconference game at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Redshirt freshman quarterback Kurt Lasher, subbing for injured starter Paul 
Justin, put the Sun Devils ahead 21-14 on his off-balance scoring strike to 
Winsley with 1:59 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Winsley's touchdown run came with 14:11 to go in the game as Arizona State 
improved to 2-0. It was San Jose State's season opener. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans closed to 28-21 on backup quarterback Ralph Martini's three-yard 
touchdown run with 9:50 left and drove from their own 47 to the Arizona State 8 
before turning the ball over on downs with 3:06 to play.

HIGH-FLYING DUCKS ROUT IOWA;

MUSGRAVE THROWS FOR THREE SCORES IN 44-6 VICTORY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Musgrave completed 20 of 27 passes for 263 yards and three touchdowns to 
lead the Oregon Ducks to a 44-6 thrashing of Iowa Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Coach Rich Brooks came into the game worrying about Iowa's running game 
and big offensive line. But the smaller Ducks used their quickness to beat 
Iowa's linemen, and the Hawkeyes were held to just 26 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest advantage we had was quickness on the line," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't let them establish a running game. That was my biggest fear. If they 
can't run the ball, we know we can defend the pass fairly well." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon picked off three Iowa passes. 
</P>
<P>
"We got whipped up front," Iowa Coach Haden Fry said. "They were in our 
backfield all day on running plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that it would be tough, but we never dreamed it would be that bad. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got our tail kicked real good." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks added that he was glad Musgrave made a good showing on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"He is an outstanding quarterback," Brooks said. "He makes good decisions. I'm 
glad that the Midwest people finally got a chance to see him perform. He 
deserves all the credit he's been getting." 
</P>
<P>
Iowa suffered its worst season-opening loss since its 48-0 defeat at the hands 
of USC in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon improved to 2-0, putting the game away in the third quarter as Musgrave 
directed long touchdown drives on the first two possessions to make the score 
38-0. 
</P>
<P>
Musgrave, who completed 17 of 31 passes for 231 yards and three touchdowns in a 
35-19 victory over California last Saturday, took the Ducks on a 73-yard, 
11-play drive on the first series of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
He threw a soft scoring pass to Kolya Tefft in the back of the end zone with 
10:21 to play in the third and after Iowa was forced to punt after three plays, 
he capped a 71-yard drive by hitting Tefft with a five-yard touchdown pass with 
6:18 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon used its reserve quarterbacks the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa, unable to move the ball with quarterback Tom Poholsky, finally scored 
when backup Matt Rodgers scored on a bootleg play around right end on 
fourth-and-inches at 14:55 of the last quarter. The Hawkeyes failed on the 
two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks took the lead on their first possession of the game when Musgrave 
threw a 22-yard scoring pass to Tony Hargain. 
</P>
<P>
They scored two more times in the second quarter on short plunges by Latin 
Berry and Derek Loville. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon's Greg McCallum, who had a 25-yard field goal with 16 seconds left in 
the first half, added field goals of 42 and 39 yards in the second half.

HUSKIES GET BIG PLAYS AND A BIG WIN, 38-9

<P>
It's not too late to teach an old Husky new tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Coach Don James, a long-time proponent of a conservative, 
grind-it-out offense, has switched to a one-back, short passing formation, 
looking for the big play. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, he got what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally hit a couple of big plays," James said after the 15th-ranked 
Huskies pounded Purdue, 38-9, for their ninth victory in a row over a Big Ten 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, which beat Texas A&amp;M, 19-6, in its opener, recorded the two 
longest non-scoring plays in its 100-year football history -- a 78-yard run by 
Greg Lewis and 76-yard pass play in which Cary Conklin threw to Andre Riley. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies (2-0) shut out the Boilermakers (1-1) for the first three quarters. 
Purdue scored a touchdown and a safety against Washington's reserves in the 
fourth quarter and gained only 39 yards rushing for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue quarterback Steve Letnich said: "We wanted to put something on the 
scoreboard. Washington did some great things on defense. They're a solid, 
legitimate top 10 team. They're going to beat a lot of people this year." 
</P>
<P>
Conklin passed for three touchdowns and ran for a fourth, completing 14 of 27 
for 215 yards and no interceptions. Riley caught four passes for 137 yards 
while Lewis carried 20 times for 165 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' 78-yard run came in the third quarter on a quick opener over left guard. 
He was caught from behind by strong safety Terry Johnson at the four and 
Washington scored its fifth touchdown of the game three plays later on 
Conklin's five-yard pass to tight end Aaron Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin teamed with Riley on a corner pattern on the left side of the field for 
their 76-yard completion in the second quarter. Riley got behind the Purdue 
defense, but was caught from behind by cornerback Derrick Kelson on the four. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Conklin threw a two-yard scoring pass to Lewis for a 24-0 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue's fourth-quarter touchdown came on a 25-yard pass play from Letnich to 
Calvin Williams.

EASY START FOR TITANS IS MIRAGE

<P>
The last time Earle Bruce won a football game as a Division I coach, he beat 
Michigan in his Ohio State farewell, the Saturday after he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
There won't be another one like that as long as he lives, but Bruce got one 
with a bit of sweetness to it Saturday, guiding Colorado State to its first 
victory in his three-game tenure as coach by beating Cal State Fullerton, 
42-14, in front of 20,098 at Hughes Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State lost on the road to two nationally ranked teams, Tennessee and 
Colorado, in its first two games. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams took a 14-point halftime lead but saw Fullerton trim it to seven in 
the third quarter before breaking open the game with three fourth-quarter 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really pleased with our first win," said Bruce, who was fired at Ohio 
State in 1987 and coached at Division I-AA Northern Iowa last year. "That's the 
way we want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
It was not at all the way Fullerton wanted to do it. The Titans committed seven 
turnovers, including four interceptions by starting quarterback Dan Speltz and 
a fumbled punt reception at their own 16-yard line that quickly became a Ram 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've got a mediocre team and you turn the ball over seven times, you 
don't expect to win," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "I don't care if it's 
football, baseball or dominoes." 
</P>
<P>
With the Titans' help, Colorado State rolled to only its third victory in the 
past 27 games. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's victory broke a six-game losing streak dating to Oct. 22, 1988, when 
the Rams beat San Diego State. Before that victory, the Rams had lost 11 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
They had not scored so many points since the third game of the 1986 season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton now must contemplate a nonconference season that has gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans were fortunate enough this season to get a break in a brutal 
nonconference schedule that has included Florida, Louisiana State, West 
Virginia and Wyoming in recent years and will include Auburn and Georgia in the 
next two. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Titans had four opponents who combined to go 17-27 last season. 
A 4-0 start seemed possible; 3-1 would have been acceptable. But after three 
games, the Titans are 1-2, with the only victory a come-from-behind victory 
over Division II Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans lost to Northern Illinois in their opener, and will finish the 
nonconference season against San Diego State Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the objective of any head football coach is to win every game you 
play, but if you don't win, you expect to get better as a football team," 
Murphy said. "We got better individually today, but I don't think we got better 
as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Yert, a Mission Viejo High School product, scored four touchdowns, all 
from three yards out or less, tying a Titan record he set two years ago.

NEBRASKA GROUNDS OUT 432 YARDS AND DEFEATS UTAH, 42-30

Ken Clark rushed for 130 yards and one touchdown, Bryan Carpenter added 107 
yards and another score and quarterback Gerry Gdowski scored three touchdowns 
as the No. 4-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers defeated Utah, 42-30, Saturday at 
Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Cornhuskers had 432 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Utah fell to 1-2 despite Scott Mitchell completing 26 of 44 passes for 297 
yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska (2-0) found itself down 13-7 in the first quarter after Mitchell 
passed to tight end Dennis Smith for touchdowns on passes of five and 43 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Gdowski scored his second touchdown on an eight-yard run early in the second 
quarter to put the Cornhuskers ahead to stay, 14-13, and Nebraska's Mike Croel 
intercepted a Mitchell pass one minute later and ran it in from six yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell then got the Utes into field goal range and Wayne Lammle hit on a 
45-yarder with 5:16 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell ended the first half with 169 yards on 16 of 23 passes, but the Husker 
pass rush and Clark and company took over the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who had 168 yards rushing in 20 minutes last week, had only 47 by 
halftime against Utah. In the second half, he broke loose to help Nebraska roll 
up the ground yards and an edge in time-of-possession of nearly 19 minutes to 
11. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth straight game that Clark ran for 100 or more yards. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Iowa 10, Kansas State 8 -- The Kansas State has now gone 29 games 
without a victory as Ken Macklin threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to Greg Wallace 
and Brian Mitchell kicked a 39-yard field goal to lead the Panthers over the 
Wildcats at Manhattan, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State's last win came in October, 1986. The Wildcats have lost 15 
straight since a 17-17 tie with Kansas in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State (0-2) at least managed to make this game exciting in the final two 
minutes, scoring a touchdown and adding a two-point conversion to close the gap 
after Division I-AA Northern Iowa (1-1) had done all its scoring in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas 28, Kent State 21 -- Tony Sands rushed for 146 yards and two touchdowns 
to lead the Jayhawks over the Golden Flashes at Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas Coach Glen Mason used to coach at Kent State, and two years ago his Kent 
State team beat Kansas, 31-17. 
</P>
<P>
Mason, in his second year at Kansas, beat Kent State last year. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (2-1) jumped to an 18-0 lead over Kent State (0-3) on the first play of 
the second period, but had to bat away a fourth-down pass in the end zone to 
prevent a 21-21 tie in the third quarter.

SYRACUSE STRUGGLES TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
No. 11-ranked Syracuse, committing three turnovers and having a punt blocked on 
its first four possessions, barely defeated Army, 10-7, Saturday at Syracuse, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
A 23-yard touchdown run by Michael Owens in the third quarter enabled the 
Orangemen to win their 16th straight in the Carrier Dome, where Syracuse 
celebrated its football centennial in front of 48,331. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse (2-0) drove 71 yards for the winning touchdown, with Owens accounting 
for 48 of the yards in four carries. He scored by running down the right 
sideline with 2:33 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse, which hadn't had a scoreless first half in three years, trailed 7-0 
at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
On Syracuse's opening drive, fullback Duane Kinnon fumbled into the Army end 
zone. The next two drives were stopped by interceptions and then a blocked punt 
by outside linebacker John Nadolski set up Army's lone touchdown, which came on 
a one-yard run by Mike Mayweather in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia 45, South Carolina 21 -- Major Harris completed 17 of 20 passes 
for 239 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another to lead the Mountaineers 
over the Gamecocks in front of 66,015 at Morgantown, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
The Mountaineers (3-0) extended the nation's longest regular-season winning 
streak to 14 games. South Carolina dropped to 1-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina quarterback Todd Ellis completed 21 of 37 for 256 yards and 
three touchdowns, but he was intercepted twice and sacked three times. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State 42, Temple 3 -- Blair Thomas rushed for 138 yards and two touchdowns 
and Tom Bill passed for 192 yards and a pair of scores as the Nittany Lions 
romped over the Owls at State College, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State (1-1) extended its record over Temple (0-3) to 23-3-1 in a series 
that started in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who missed last season because of knee surgery, had 21 carries in 
recording his ninth 100-yard game. Bill's scoring passes both went to Dave 
Daniels and covered 75 and 38 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Rutgers 9, Boston College 7 -- John Blanton blocked a punt to set up a 21-yard 
field goal by Doug Giesler with nine seconds left as the Scarlet Knights 
rallied to defeat the Eagles at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 7-6 with two minutes remaining, the Eagles had a fourth-and-nine at the 
Rutgers 46. Punter Brian Lowe fielded a low snap from center, avoided a rush 
and threw a pass to David Johnson for a gain to the Rutgers 16. 
</P>

But the play was nullified because of an illegal lineman downfield, and Lowe's

It took Siran Stacy a long time to get back to Alabama, but when he arrived he 
made it "an emotional happening." 
</P>
<P>
A junior starting his first game at Alabama, the 5-foot-11, 195-pound halfback 
tied two school records in scoring four times as the 16th-ranked Crimson Tide 
defeated Memphis State, 35-7, Saturday at Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
"I've dreamed about playing here all my life," said Stacy, who went from 
Geneva, Ala., to Coffeeville Junior College in Kansas, where he led all junior 
college players in scoring last season. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy was the first Alabama runner since 1945 to gain more than 100 yards in 
his first game, winding up with 169, including scoring runs of 44 and 64 yards 
against the winless Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy, who also scored from the six and one, tied the school record for most 
rushing touchdowns in a game and most points in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee 28, Duke 6 -- Reggie Cobb ran for three touchdowns and 109 yards, 
including a career-high 61-yard run, to lead the 17th-ranked Volunteers to a 
victory over the Blue Devils at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Duke (1-2) threatened several times using their vaunted passing attack, but 
could only manage two field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee (3-0) stopped the Blue Devils with key interceptions by Darryl Hardy, 
Mark Fletcher and Earnest Fields. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn 24, So. Mississippi 3 -- James Joseph rushed for a career-high 149 yards 
in 23 carries and Lamar Rogers led a relentless Auburn defense as the No. 5 
Tigers defeated the Golden Eagles at Auburn, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
The Auburn defense, one of the nation's toughest in 1988, held its opponent 
without a touchdown for the second straight week as the Tigers improved to 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Miss, which upset then-No. 3 Florida State to open the season, could 
not put together a touchdown drive as Rogers and Craig Ogletree continuously 
pressured quarterback Brett Favre, dropping the Golden Eagles to 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia 15, Baylor 3 -- Quarterback Greg Talley scored on a four-yard run and 
John Kasay kicked three field goals to lead the Bulldogs to a win the Bears at 
Athens, Ga., making Bulldog Coach Ray Goff's debut a successful one. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor (0-2) took a 3-0 lead early in the second quarter on a 32-yard field 
goal by Jeff Ireland, but Georgia (1-0) scored 12 consecutive points to take a 
12-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Florida 34, Louisiana Tech 7 -- Kyle Morris threw long scoring passes to three 
receivers as the Gators ended a streak of 10 consecutive games without a 
touchdown pass at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Mills and Tony Lomack scored on pass plays of 69 and 84 yards, 
respectively, and Morris threw 43 yards to Terence Barber for a third-quarter 
touchdown that helped the Gators pull away from a 10-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Florida (1-1) had not scored on a touchdown pass since beating Indiana State, 
58-0, on Sept. 17, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The three that Morris threw Saturday equaled his total of all last season, when 
Gators lost five of their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana Tech is now 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky 13, North Carolina 6 -- Alfred Rawls scored a seven-yard touchdown on 
the opening series and the Wildcats' defense dominated the Tar Heels at 
Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky (2-0) drove 72 yards in 11 plays with Rawls going around left end for 
the score with 10:03 left in the first period for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky's Ken Willis connected on a 33-yard field goal for a 10-3 halftime 
advantage and added a career-long 50-yard kick in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina is now 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 34, Arkansas St. 31 -- John Darnell threw for 412 yards and three 
touchdowns as the Rebels rallied in the second half at Oxford, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell had touchdown passes of 57, 42 and 46 yards to senior flanker Pat 
Coleman. With five receptions, Coleman had 200 yards -- a school record.

Clemson tailback Terry Allen ran for one touchdown and passed for another as 
the seventh-ranked Tigers smothered Virginia Tech's ground game in a 27-7 
victory Saturday night at Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the scoring by both teams came during 32 seconds at the end of the 
third quarter. Before that, Clemson led, 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
Allen completed a 66-yard option pass to flanker Gary Cooper with 34 seconds 
left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech's Marcus Mickel then returned the kickoff 90 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech recovered an onside kick to open the game. After the Hokies 
failed on their own option pass attempt, Clemson linebacker Levon Kirkland 
intercepted a deflected pass and ran 47 yards into the end zone to make it 
27-7. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson is now 3-0, the Hokies 1-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 17, Georgia Tech 10 -- Shawn Moore connected on passes covering 61 and 
42 yards to tight end Bruce McGonnigal to set up a touchdown and field goal, 
leading the Cavaliers to an Atlantic Coast Conference victory over the Yellow 
Jackets at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia, 2-1 overall and 1-0 in the ACC, broke a 7-7 tie nine minutes before 
halftime on freshman Terry Kirby's three-yard run. The score came one play 
after McGonnigal completed a 61-yard pass play. 
</P>
<P>
McGonnigal, who had six catches for 157 yards, carried his 42-yard reception to 
the Yellow Jacket 19, setting up a 30-yard field goal by Jake McInerney late in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 16th consecutive ACC setback for Tech, which is 0-2 this season. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina St. 27, Wake Forest 17 -- Shane Montgomery completed 24 of 39 
passes for 298 yards and two touchdowns as the 19th-ranked Wolfpack won at 
Winston Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery's performance lifted the Wolfpack to 3-0 and overshadowed the play 
of Wake Forest quarterback Phil Barnhill, a left-handed junior making only his 
second career start who completed 21 of 40 passes for 321 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Wake Forest is now 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland 23, Western Michigan 0 -- Neil O'Donnell threw two touchdown passes in 
the final 2:26 of the first half and the Terrapins intercepted four first-half 
passes in a win at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland (1-2) recorded its first shutout in nearly two years in a game that 
began in a heavy downpour. Western Michigan fell to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell, who completed 15 of 20 passes for 212 yards, put Maryland in front 
10-0 with a three-yard scoring pass to David Carr with 2:26 left in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays after safety Kevin Fowlkes snagged Maryland's fourth interception 
of the half, O'Donnell completed a 14-yard pass to Dean Green with 34 seconds 
left in the half for Maryland's 
</P>

HERE'S HOW: HOME IMPROVEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
'QUALITY' FINISH DOES NOT COME OUT OF A CANNONE OF THE WORK TAKES MUCH SKILL, 
BUT IT DOES TAKE AN ABUNDANCE OF PATIENCE AND TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Despite improvements in products and tools, it is still practically impossible 
to get a truly fine varnish or enamel finish right out of the can. No matter 
how good the enamel or varnish, and no matter how carefully you apply it, it's 
just about impossible to get the smooth, deep, silky finish that says "quality" 
without a lot of old-fashioned work. 
</P>
<P>
None of this work requires much skill. But it does take an abundance of 
patience and time. The basic technique is to apply several coats, sand between 
coats to smooth and level the surface, and then polish with fine abrasives to 
bring up the desired level of gloss. Here's how it goes: 
</P>
<P>
MATERIALS: Start by selecting a quality oil-based alkyd finish. If you want it 
to be clear, choose a gloss varnish. If you want enamel, which is nothing more 
than varnish with colored pigment in it, choose a gloss enamel. But in either 
case, make sure it's an alkyd formula (read the ingredients list), not a 
polyurethane. Alkyds are easier to rub out than polyurethanes. 
</P>
<P>
Next, you'll need some sandpaper and rubbing compound. Get a couple of sheets 
each of 220-, 320-, 400- and 600-grit silicon carbide Wet-or-Dry, plus a can of 
automotive rubbing compound. If you can't find these items in your hardware 
store, an auto parts store will have them. 
</P>
<P>
GETTING STARTED: If you are working over an old finish that's in reasonably 
good shape, sand it thoroughly with 220 paper. This will knock off any high 
spots and create some tooth for your new finish to grab onto. If the old finish 
is in bad shape, strip it to bare wood. 
</P>
<P>
If you are working with unfinished wood, sand it carefully with 120-grit 
aluminum oxide paper and a rubber sanding block. If you are working with 
hardwood, follow this up with another sanding, using 220-grit aluminum oxide. 
There's no real need to go this fine with pine, however. 
</P>
<P>
STAIN: If you plan to stain, now is the time to do it. Let your stain dry 
thoroughly and you are ready for your first coat of varnish. I like to thin my 
first coat about 15% with mineral spirits. This helps it penetrate and really 
get a grip on the wood. No need to be real painstaking with this coat. Most of 
it will sink in and disappear anyway. Just try to get even coverage. Then let 
it dry at least overnight. 
</P>
<P>
SAND: Next day, sand very, very lightly with 220-grit aluminum oxide paper. 
Don't overdo this. All you want to do is knock off any stubbly whiskers of wood 
that may be sticking up and create a rough surface. In this and all other 
sanding steps, be sure to use your sanding block. This will act like a plane, 
smoothing down high spots to create the level surface you are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
SECOND COAT: Apply this unthinned. Use a quality brush and flow the finish on 
across the grain. Once the coat is on, go back over it very lightly, using just 
the tip of the brush and very little pressure. The bristles of the brush should 
just barely bend, as shown in the sketch. 
</P>
<P>
If you have troubles with bubbles in your finish, it may be caused by wiping 
the excess off your brush on the rim of the can. You can prevent this by 
stringing a piece of coat hanger wire across the rim of a shallow can as shown 
in the sketch. Wipe your brush on this "strike wire" instead of the can and 
your bubble problems should be over. 
</P>
<P>
Let this second coat dry for a full day. Then sand it with 220-grit silicon 
carbide, used wet. I like to keep a dish of water by my side and dip the paper, 
sanding block and all into it every now and then. Using the paper wet like this 
will keep it from clogging and speed its cutting action. Don't sand too 
vigorously at this point or you risk cutting through to bare wood. 
</P>
<P>
THIRD COAT: Wipe your work clean and dry with a rag and apply another coat, 
just like the second one. Again, let this coat dry for a full day and repeat 
the wet sanding operation. Sand a little more thoroughly this time, and when 
you are finished, examine the surface of your work carefully. If most of the 
surface is dull from sanding, you are getting close to the end of your job. But 
if the work shows lots of glossy areas (low spots that haven't been touched by 
the sandpaper), you still have a way to go. 
</P>
<P>
FOURTH COAT: Put this on and let it dry. When this coat dries, your work should 
be fairly smooth. But typical of gloss finishes, it will look garishly bright, 
almost like plastic. More sanding and rubbing will solve this. 
</P>
<P>
So, wet sand as usual. Do a very thorough job of sanding, but this time switch 
to 320-grit paper. After sanding, examine your work. If the whole surface is 
uniformly sanded, let your work harden up for a week or so. If the surface 
still shows signs of uneven sanding, put on one more coat and sand it with 320 
until the entire surface is smooth. Let the finish harden for a week or so. 
</P>
<P>
FINAL SANDING: After waiting a week, wet sand with 400-grit paper, then repeat 
with 600 paper. This will produce a satiny surface so smooth you can't resist 
touching it. It will also soften the finish a bit, so let it harden for a 
couple more days before the final step. 
</P>
<P>
POLISHING: Using your automotive rubbing compound and a damp rag, give your 
entire piece a thorough rubbing. This is a lot like waxing your car, but it 
takes longer. Figure on about 30 minutes of work for an area the size of a card 
table. Keep using fresh rubbing compound and new rags as you go along. 
Gradually the surface will begin to shine and eventually it will take on a deep 
rich gloss with a wonderful silky feel, nothing like that bright shine you get 
with an unrubbed gloss finish. 
</P>
<P>
TUNING: For an even brighter shine, you can follow up with an automotive paste 
wax. But if the shine you get is already too glossy for your taste, you can 
tone it down by careful rubbing with very fine, 0000 steel wool. 
</P>
<P>
SHORTCUT: Rubbing the final coat is a lot of work, but it's definitely worth 
the effort on a piece of fine furniture. For something a little more 
utilitarian -- a kitchen table for example -- you can get by with a simpler 
approach. Skip all that rubbing and simply use a semi-gloss, eggshell or even 
flat varnish or enamel for your final coat. 
</P>
<P>
If you apply this carefully in a clean, dust-free room, it should dry to a 
surface smooth enough for all but the most critical work. It will not, however, 
have the look or feel of a rubbed finish. Only rubbing can give you that.DR,

GUIDELINES FOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City and county officials who want to explore affordable rental housing for 
elderly and lower-income residents may find that working with a nonprofit 
housing development corporation like Corporate Fund for Housing (active in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino counties) is a way to 
build affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some guidelines for officials: 
</P>
<P>
Do you need such housing? If you have completed a recent housing element or 
housing market study, you have a good source of data on local needs. 
</P>
<P>
If you have such local resources as surplus city land, community development 
block grant funds, tax increment funds from a redevelopment project, first-loss 
guarantees on a tax-exempt bond issue and/or would be willing to grant 
regulatory concessions to make a project feasible, you may be able to work with 
a nonprofit housing development corporation to produce an affordable housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
There are several government programs that facilitate working with local 
nonprofits. Among theses are the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, Nonprofit Tax 
Exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds, the Section 8/202 program and California's 
recently passed Propositions 77 and 84. 
</P>
<P>
If you put local resources into an affordable project or grant a developer 
concessions on parking, zoning, etc. as a trade-off for affordable housing, you 
may be concerned with keeping your units affordable over time. If you have 
older projects that used HUD programs which have subsidies or mortgages that 
are expiring soon, nonprofit ownership may be the way to keep these units 
affordable, according to Fred Kahane of CFH. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact Fred Kahane or Scott Kutner at the Corporate Fund 
for Housing, (213) 216-9333.

Algerian Prime Minister Mouloud Hamrouche, appointed a week ago to speed 
democratic reforms, replaced all but three ministers in forming a new Cabinet, 
the official news agency APS said. Former Finance Minister Sid Ahmed Ghezali 
was named foreign minister, replacing Boualem Bessaieh, the Algerian member of 
an Arab League committee that has been attempting to forge a peace plan to end 
Lebanon's 14-year civil war. Meanwhile, in a step toward multi-party democracy, 
the government legalized an Islamic fundamentalist party, the Islamic Salvation 
Front, which political observers expect to become the second-largest party in 
the country after the ruling National Liberation Front.

In a blow to Proposition 73, a federal judge in Sacramento has ruled that 
candidates for elective office can spend money they raised before Jan. 1, 1989, 
despite the prohibitions of the campaign finance initiative. U.S. District 
Judge Lawrence K. Karlton, issued a permanent injunction overturning a 
provision of the law that had prohibited candidates from spending money in 
their campaigns if it was raised before the law took effect. In a suit brought 
by Democrats, Karlton ruled that such a prohibition violated the First 
Amendment right to free speech. As a result of his decision, Democratic 
candidates will be able to spend more than $12 million on future campaigns that 
they had banked before the first of the year.

An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 shook southern and central Mexico, but 
there were no reports of damage or injuries. The National Seismological Service 
said the quake, which occurred in the early evening, was centered 250 miles 
southeast of Mexico City on the coast of Oaxaca state. The earthquake was also 
felt in the capital. An earthquake of a magnitude 5 is defined as one that can 
cause considerable damage. An earthquake with a magnitude of 8.1 struck Mexico 
City on Sept. 19, 1985, and a second temblor measuring 7.6 hit the next day, 
resulting in the deaths of at least 10,000 people and leveling large areas of 
the city.

Donald P. Gregg, the new U.S. ambassador to South Korea, arrived in Seoul and 
said Washington will keep the approximately 40,000-strong American force on the 
peninsula until South Koreans decide otherwise. Gregg, 61, was confirmed by the 
Senate last Tuesday. His nomination had been held up in the Senate since March

complicity in the Iran-Contra scandal. His arrival in Seoul precedes a

The Philippine Supreme Court upheld a government decision barring former 
President Ferdinand E. Marcos from returning to the Philippines. It voted 8 to 
7 to dismiss a petition by Marcos seeking to return home. The court said 
President Corazon Aquino "did not act arbitrarily or with grave abuse of 
discretion" in barring Marcos' return as a "serious threat to the national 
interest and welfare." Marcos, 72, has lived in exile in Hawaii since he was 
overthrown in February, 1986, by an uprising that brought Aquino to power. He 
has been hospitalized since January.

QUAYLE SAYS SHUTTLE PAYLOAD NO HAZARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle said the flight is no more dangerous than any other, 
and that he plans to "go down and see the launch" in person, but anti-nuclear 
activists vowed to file suit to block the Oct. 12 launch of the shuttle 
Atlantis and its plutonium-powered payload. Atlantis' crew flew to Washington 
to meet with Quayle, chairman of the National Space Council, where Quayle and 
his wife, Marilyn, hosted breakfast for them. The vice president said the 
Galileo space probe's atomic generators are safe, and that "there's no reason 
to have this concern. We just completed a very successful Voyager 2 
expedition." The probe's electricity is provided by plutonium-powered 
generators and anti-nuclear activists claim the flight should be grounded 
because of the threat of a radiation release in the event of a shuttle launch 
catastrophe or an accidental re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.

Several thousand people attended a peaceful pro-union rally at the Capitol in 
St. Paul, Minn., to express their support for striking workers at the 
$535-million expansion of Boise Cascade's paper mill in International Falls. 
Later, residents of International Falls gathered in Smokey Bear Park for what 
was called "a peace rally" to show community appreciation for law enforcement 
personnel and firefighters. Bill Peterson, president of the Minnesota Building 
Trades Council, told the St. Paul rally that last week's violence in 
International Falls was prompted by the hiring of non-union labor at Boise's 
mill expansion. The non-union hirings led strikers to walk off their jobs in 
July. Some 400 demonstrators caused more than $1 million in damage at Boise's 
temporary housing for non-union labor.

A Jesuit order has sold a 1,100-acre plot of land in the Santa Cruz Mountains 
to a Hong Kong billionaire who plans to build a golf course on part of the 
land. The Hong Kong Metro Realty Co., headed by Dr. Stanley Ho of Hong Kong and 
the Lee family of Madison, Wis., agreed to pay more than $10 million for the 
property, which lies in an unincorporated area of Santa Clara County near Los 
Gatos. The rolling meadowland and redwood forest was the former home of Alta 
College, a Jesuit school, and has been owned by the Catholic order for several 
decades. The developers plan to build on 400 to 500 acres, leaving the rest 
open space.

ACLU HOISTS FREE-SPEECH BANNER IN STADIUM SIGN BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Friday, Sept. 1, during the San Diego Chargers' final preseason game against 
the Phoenix Cardinals, a banner was removed from the loge level of San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The banner read: "Fire Ortmayer." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ortmayer is the Chargers' director of football operations, whom many fans 
see as the reason for the team's lackluster showing. He has been criticized for 
making trades that have hurt the team and for not being able to sign veteran 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Whether fans are right or not in their opinion of Ortmayer, the American Civil 
Liberties Union believes they have a right to express such views in a publicly 
owned stadium, either verbally or through the use of banners. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers say they have a policy of removing banners of a "disparaging 
nature." They include in that category banners critical of team management. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU says the Chargers may have stepped out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"By allowing banners, they've created a public forum which requires that all 
views be aired," said Linda Hills, executive director of the ACLU of San Diego 
and Imperial counties. "And they can't just ban the views they don't agree 
with." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ACLU to Investigate 
</P>
<P>
Hills said the local office will look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU has recently filed complaints against the Cincinnati Bengals and New 
York Yankees, whose stadiums are owned by the public, as is San Diego's. 
</P>
<P>
"Selective confiscation, based upon the content of banners, cannot be tolerated 
in a free society," said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York 
chapter of the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel said he will encourage San Diego's ACLU office to take action against 
the Chargers. He said the issue of banners being removed from stadiums because 
of so-called negative content "may start to crop up all over the place. . . . 
New York and Cincinnati -- and, from the way it sounds, San Diego -- are just 
the start." 
</P>
<P>
Siegel is involved in a controversy with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, 
who, although playing in a city-owned stadium, maintains that he has the right 
to order the removal of banners uncomplimentary to himself or the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Teele, director of administration for the Chargers, said his club has the 
same right. 
</P>
<P>
"And why?" Teele said. "Because we pay the rent." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Allisyn Thomas said she isn't sure that merely leasing a 
public facility gives a tenant the power of selective confiscation of banners. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it's a public property," she said. "And certain constitutional 
requirements concerning free speech and freedom of expression have to be 
adhered to by tenants. I intend to look into this further." 
</P>
<P>
Teele said the Chargers maintain four criteria governing the display of banners 
at the stadium: 
</P>
<P>
* They must be germane to the game. 
</P>
<P>
* They must not contain profanity. 
</P>
<P>
* They must not block the view of other fans. 
</P>
<P>
* They must not be disparaging. 
</P>
<P>
What does he define as disparaging? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you know, if it said, 'Screw the L.A. Times' or 'Fire Ortmayer,' " Teele 
said. "We rent the hall, and the person buys a seat. I don't know that the 
person buys the right to do that sort of thing. That's the kind of thing that 
people don't have any business doing. We won't tolerate that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Consumer Issue 
</P>
<P>
Countered Siegel: "Look, you ought to be able to have signs at the ballpark. 
Fans have a lot of power -- they just don't know it. What we have to understand 
is that, politically and economically, fans pay for professional sports. 
Without us, they aren't in business. 
</P>
<P>
"Owners have to be reminded periodically that we are the consumers. We should 
see this as a consumer movement as well. It seems as though owners would like 
fans to sit there and be bland and homogenous, but that's not what the sports 
themselves are all about. They're about diversity and conflict, winning and 
losing. This attitude in professional football of trying to silence the fans is 
abhorrent. 
</P>
<P>
"In a publicly owned stadium, the lessee cannot censure a fan based upon the 
content of a banner. There is no legal way to defense that -- none whatsoever. 
And to do so is entirely inappropriate in a publicly held entity such as (San 
Diego) Jack Murphy Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Teele said that, rather than tussle in a controversy, the Chargers might 
consider banning all signs and banners. But he added that such an action would 
be "a last resort" and one he would take "regretfully, but out of necessity, if 
I'm pushed up against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than have somebody tell me how to run my business, or pay lawyers to do 
battle with the ACLU, I'll take 'em all away," Teele said. "We pay the rent, 
and it's a sizable sum -- 10% of the gross. Why should we rent a place, put on 
a football game, and just sit back and let some idiot put up a disparaging 
sign?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raiders Fair Game 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, however, banners are put up that disparage the other team. 
Anti-Los Angeles Raiders banners are not uncommon at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the Raiders don't rent the hall," Teele said. "We do." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Adams, vice president of business operations for baseball's San Diego 
Padres, said that his club permits no banners at the stadium, unless they're 
germane to a particular team promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all part of the issue of crowd control, and besides, we think banners 
detract from the game," Adams said. "Some cities tolerate a lot of banners 
regardless of the message, but we don't believe in that here." 
</P>
<P>
Siegel of the ACLU said the banning of all banners "would constitute a stronger 
case than any of these teams presently have." Even so, he said, "that would 
seem antithetical to what sports in America are all about. As long as they 
don't interfere with a fan's ability to enjoy the game, I don't see why anyone 
would mind. 
</P>
<P>
"To not be able to express yourself at a game with a banner or with your own 
mouth, well, it's nothing less than un-American."

1 KILLED, 8 INJURED IN GANG VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gang-related attacks claimed one woman's life and injured her mother as they 
lay sleeping inside their Lennox home, with the latest round of gang gunfire in 
the Los Angeles area leaving seven others wounded late Friday and early 
Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Renee Johnson and her mother, Ann, were sleeping in the living room of their 
home in the 11000 block of South Osage Avenue when a man armed with a shotgun 
kicked in their front door and started firing. 
</P>
<P>
Renee Johnson was hit in the upper torso in the 3:10 a.m. attack and died at 
the scene, a sheriff's deputy said. Ann Johnson, 45, was wounded in the right 
arm and right leg. She was taken to Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center, where she 
was reported to be in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Motive Unknown 
</P>
<P>
A Sheriff's Department spokesman could not explain the gang connection other 
than to say that police believe that the attack on the Johnsons had a gang 
tie-in. "The motive for the shooting is unknown," Deputy George Ducoulombier 
said. "But it appears to be gang-related." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, a security guard in Koreatown was shot in the leg about 1:30 
a.m. while trying to prevent gang members from firing into an apartment 
building marked with rival gang graffiti, police said. The unidentified guard 
was hospitalized in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Ely Torres, 24, three hours after the South Kenmore Avenue 
shooting. They said Torres, believed to be a gang member, was spotted driving 
the getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
Torres was stopped near Washington Boulevard and Hoover Street. Police said his 
car contained a sawed-off shotgun that had apparently been used in the attack 
on the guard. 
</P>
<P>
"There possibly were other gang members involved," Los Angeles Police Sgt. 
James Markoff said. The wall "had rival gang slogans on it and they came . . . 
to shoot it up." 
</P>
<P>
Police also blamed gang rivalries for two other unrelated attacks that left six 
people wounded in the Newton area. 
</P>
<P>
One unidentified gang member was critically wounded when he was shot in the 
throat and chest during a drive-by attack in the 900 block of East 40th Street 
late Friday, police said. The wounded man was taken to County-USC Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Another reputed gang member who was standing in the same area was struck in the 
leg. He was treated at White Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In the other shooting, four men were wounded as they stood outside a house in 
the 5700 block of South Broadway at 1:35 a.m. Saturday, police said. All four 
were reportedly struck below the waist when three gang members opened fire from 
a passing car. Their names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
One policeman said of the outbreak of gang-related violence: "Everybody just 
decided it was a good time to get in a car, drive by your enemy's house and 
fire a few blasts." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the special police gang-sweeping operation known as "Operation 
Hammer" hit the streets in South-Central Los Angeles and in the harbor area on 
Saturday night, with more than 250 officers logging at least 51 arrests by 9 
p.m., Sgt. Clay Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests included 30 felonies -- mostly for narcotics sales and possession 
-- involving 25 known gang members, Farrell said.

D.A. OFFERS HELP IN BOUNCING BACK FROM BAD CHECKS; 
</P>
<P>
'SCHOOL' TEACHES SMALL-TIMERS ABOUT ETHICS, BUDGET-KEEPING

<P>
One by one their confessions poured out: 
</P>
<P>
"I bounced two of them -- $70 for food and $20 for the phone bill," said Wayne 
Adams, 29, of La Puente. "It was January, right after Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
The man sitting across from Adams committed his offense the day his baby son 
was baptized. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a $200 check to a liquor store for the baptismal party," he said in a 
low voice. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had enough money," said Larry Logsdon, 35, a Glendora vitamin 
salesman. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
And neither did any of the other 19 people seated around him. They are all 
bad-check writers and as punishment for their misdemeanor crimes they have been 
ordered to spend four hours in Bad Check Writer's School, the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's equivalent of traffic school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weekend Class 
</P>
<P>
But instead of the rules of the road, these offenders grapple with the lines of 
check book ledgers. Every weekend, groups of 20 to 30 meet inside empty bank 
buildings to learn about the ethics of bad-check writing and the basics of 
money management. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to learn to take control of your lives and always know how much money 
you have in your checking account," instructor Teri Sheya said. "The purpose of 
this class is to teach you to change your spending habits." 
</P>
<P>
The class is the concluding requirement of a pilot program in parts of Los 
Angeles County that also orders check bouncers to repay creditors and fines 
them $65. 
</P>
<P>
The diversion program, which keeps first-offenders out of the court system, has 
been so successful -- $1.2 million returned to merchants since late 1986 -- 
that plans call for it to double in size in November to include the city of Los 
Angeles, said Capt. Edmund M. Aleks, who heads the program for the district 
attorney's special operation division. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment operates in a stretch from Burbank through the San Gabriel 
Valley to Pomona and in the southeastern county, including Cerritos, Norwalk 
and Signal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed not at felons who weave sophisticated and fraudulent 
financial trails, but at people who write bad checks under $200. 
</P>
<P>
Any person who has received a bad check must attempt twice to clear it before 
filling out a bad-check report and forwarding it to the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The six investigators then send out notices to the check writers -- generally 
homemakers, salesmen, laborers and bookkeepers who don't know how to balance 
their checkbooks -- Aleks said. Some believe that it is all right to "float" a 
few checks. Others are victims of their subtraction errors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dumb mistakes that brings most of us here today," Logsdon, who wrote a 
$75 bad supermarket check. "I know I've been kicking myself ever since." 
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 people have completed the class and received a faux-parchment 
certificate, one diploma that "most people don't hang on their wall," said 
Sheya, one of the finance professionals hired by the district attorney to teach 
the course. 
</P>
<P>
At one recent class, 20 students gathered at 9 a.m. outside the doors of the 
Mercury Savings Bank in West Covina. Most leaned against the rail with downcast 
eyes and folded arms until the teachers opened the doors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the bank's fault," grumbled Cynthia Daniels, 37, of West Covina. "I 
don't feel the least bit guilty about this. I'm going to chalk this morning up 
for experience." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dose of Cheer 
</P>
<P>
"It's embarrassing to be here," said another woman who did not want her name 
published. 
</P>
<P>
Sheya, dressed in a tailored pink suit, attempted to inject a dose of morning 
cheer into her students, most of whom wore sweats. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we're going to have some fun today, right?" she asked. No response. So, 
she began the class with a warning: Students who skip out early and don't 
complete the course risk arrest and prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The students perked up, though, and several shouted "no" when Sheya asked 
whether a bad-check writer is the same as a thief. 
</P>
<P>
"If you make good on the check and pay the late charges, who gets hurt?" one 
man commented. 
</P>
<P>
According to California law, Sheya explained, anyone who writes a check without 
enough money to cover it with the intent to defraud commits a crime, said 
Sheya, a corporate security officer for Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
But Kathy Ward, 33, of West Covina had difficulty admitting that she broke the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
"I just bought some groceries. How could they get me for buying milk for my 
children?" Ward asked, adding that she did not believe that a $44.92 bad check 
to a supermarket would end up with the district attorney. So she said she 
ignored the first notice. 
</P>
<P>
"But that second letter scared me," she said. "I figured I better take care of 
it before the police come . . . to get me." 
</P>
<P>
Instructor Christine Daniels, a former Security Pacific Bank branch manager, 
said students need to "take control of their money" and stop playing "float 
roulette," the habit of writing a bad check and depositing the funds to cover 
it later. 
</P>
<P>
To graduate from bad-check writer's school, students must balance a bank 
statement and a checkbook register printed in their workbook. 
</P>
<P>
This was a first for Doug Duncan, 35, a West Covina floor layer who wrote three 
bad checks totaling $96 against a $5,000 New York state check he deposited into 
his account. "I didn't know the bank puts holds on out-of-state checks," he 
explained. But even if the large check had cleared, Duncan still would have not 
known his checking account balance. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get the statement I throw it up on the dashboard," Duncan said. "I 
don't even balance it -- too confusing. It's not balanced now." 
</P>
<P>
After showing his balanced register, Wayne Adams collected his diploma and said 
he decided to get bad checks out of his life the easy way. 
</P>
<P>
"I just gave up. I threw the checkbook away," he said. "Now it's cash and 
carry."

STORE ROBBED OF $500,000 IN JEWELRY

Three robbers brandishing handguns took $500,000 worth of jewelry from a 
Sherman Oaks department store Friday night, stuffing necklaces, bracelets, pins 
and rings in bags as horrified customers and clerks looked on, police said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second robbery of expensive jewelry from a department store at the 
Sherman Oaks Fashion Square in recent months, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>

No shots were fired and no one was injured during the robbery of Bullock's fine 
jewelry department about 8:20 p.m.

Bullock's Robbed 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Sgt. Don Holmes said the three men walked into Bullock's at 
14000 Riverside Drive and forced one of the store clerks to open the locked 
jewelry case. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as other clerks and customers watched, one of the gunmen jumped over the 
display counter and grabbed handfuls of assorted jewelry, stashing them in 
bags, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of unusual that they could get that much" so quickly, said Sgt. Ted 
Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, all said to be in their late 20s or early 30s, fled the mall in a 
tan station wagon and were last seen driving north on Ranchito Avenue two 
blocks away, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Bullock's executives declined to comment on the robbery. The displays were 
repaired and stocked by Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
During a robbery at the mall in July, about $200,000 worth of jewelry was taken 
from the Broadway department store at the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Broadway store officials refused to comment on that robbery.

ZERO TOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a critique of proposed zero-tolerance measures in Poway and San Diego, the 
Los Angeles Times wrote on Sept. 10 ("Anti-Drug Push Needs Restraint") that "we 
are troubled by the inclusion of drug use or possession in small amounts 
(without evidence of drug dealing) as one of the grounds for eviction." The 
Times cited as harsh the circumstances of a teen-ager who "experiments" with 
illegal drugs, resulting in the eviction of the otherwise unaware family. 
</P>
<P>
However, The Times' policy of "small" tolerance is left over from the 1960s. 
"Small" tolerance sends the message that use in "small amounts" (whatever that 
is) is OK. It sets no standards and does nothing to help the user, the family 
or the community. Zero tolerance, on the other hand, can help. 
</P>
<P>
A zero-tolerance policy can help prevent drug use. The Clean Foundation has 
found that the fear of getting caught is the strongest force many youngsters 
have in overcoming peer pressure. Zero tolerance can act as a crutch -- one 
reason to say no in the face of peer pressure. Whether the criminal justice 
system provides that crutch is debatable. But, the risk of losing one's 
apartment and having to move can. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, The Times assumes that all parents are responsible in educating 
and monitoring their children. Sadly, some simply do not care or will not 
recognize the problem until it impacts them personally. A zero-tolerance policy 
can provide the incentive or shock needed by some to seek help. As a shock, 
losing one's home is better than losing one's child. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, The Times assumes the extraordinary case. Most cases will undoubtedly 
involve removal of a well-known drug nuisance from the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The major benefit of zero tolerance is establishing a clear community standard, 
which "small" tolerance does not. Over 80% of property crime is related to the 
drug problem, over $20 billion per year is spent on illicit drugs, and its 
victims are widespread. It is not only a personal problem, but a community 
nuisance; and we have a right to say no.

By casting the only vote against changing the historic name of Elm Avenue 
(circa 1886) to hard-sell "Carlsbad Village Drive," Councilman John Mamaux 
showed again what a shrewd politician he has become. I predict this street name 
change will be among the most unpopular decisions this council has made. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, the other council members all spoke in favor of spending $143,000 
of city funds (property taxes from the redevelopment area) for the stated 
purpose of attracting more traffic onto Elm -- "to help the downtown 
merchants." 
</P>
<P>
As anyone who still uses Elm knows, it already violates growth-management 
traffic standards. And as the council should know, their own traffic studies 
indicate it will continue to do so after the street-widening project is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
If there was ever a doubt this council puts the commercial interests of the 
business community ahead of the interests of Carlsbad residents, this tacky 
sellout of honorable old Elm should settle it once and for all.

WHY CAR-POOL LANES SHOULD BE OPENED TO ALL VEHICLES AND NOT JUST A SELECT FEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN ROSE-BUSBY, Eileen Rose-Busby is an instructor with San Diego 
Community Colleges, and she commutes daily from Scripps Ranch to the Naval 
Training Center in Point Loma. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're traveling with a passenger between the hours of 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. or 
3 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. on Interstate 15 between Kearny Mesa and Penasquitos, and 
you would like a leisurely 8-mile drive with few cars on "your" road, try the 
car-pool express lanes, any working day. For the remaining 18 or so hours a 
day, and weekends and holidays, this $31.4-million stretch of highway is 
deserted and useless. 
</P>
<P>
The theory behind the car-pool lanes is splendid -- get cars off the freeway by 
requiring two persons per vehicle for the privilege of using these exclusive 
and expensive lanes. Drivers wishing an easier daily commute will then gather 
up riders so as to use this special strip of roadway. 
</P>
<P>
That's the theory. But, in practice, it's something else. It's not that people 
are uncooperative and don't want to car-pool. Most would if they could. 
</P>
<P>
But, in San Diego's far-flung boundaries, it's not an easy thing to find two or 
more people who are employees of the same company (or one close by), who live 
in the same area, have the same work schedule, never work overtime or run late 
in the morning, and never vary their personal schedules to run errands, go to 
exercise class, stop at the grocery store, pick up the kids on the way home, 
drop off the kids on the way to work, go to the dentist, get sick, run late, 
leave early . . . well, you get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Transportation has insisted that it is pleased 
with the use of the car-pool lanes and has urged us to "wait a year" before 
judging their success. Well, it has been almost a year, and use is still well 
below capacity. Caltrans' most recent records show that an average of almost 
7,400 vehicles traveled the lanes daily during August (2,953 southbound, 4,432 
northbound.) This is up from an average of about 5,900 reported last October. 
But the expressway is capable of carrying 24,000 vehicles in a six-hour peak 
period -- 4,000 vehicles per hour -- more than three times the actual use. 
</P>
<P>
People must and will change travel behavior, insists Caltrans, and, to prove 
it, it plans to forge ahead with more express lanes, farther north on I-15 and 
Interstate 5. We need to ask what it is we are expecting to accomplish on this 
expensive stretch of road, when so many of San Diego's highways are nearly 
gridlocked. 
</P>
<P>
Are car-pool lanes really feasible or sensible, given San Diego's geography and 
life style? Or are they a well-meaning but expensive luxury? Are they merely a 
test of enforced car-pooling, or is traffic management what we should really be 
talking about here before we commit more millions of our tax money to a 
decision that could well become another fiasco? 
</P>
<P>
If the express lanes were open seven hours a day, 6 a.m.-9 a.m. and 3 p.m.-7 
p.m., and could be used by all vehicles, it would effectively remove a far 
greater number of vehicles from the congested regular lanes. This would 
maximize use of the lanes, rather than settling for a fraction of its capacity 
and building more of the same. It would also move all traffic faster. 
</P>
<P>
Even the existing use of the lanes has led to an increase of traffic speed in 
the regular lanes from 40 m.p.h. to nearly 50 m.p.h., according to Caltrans. 
Opening the lanes to the public would move all traffic more smoothly at 
speed-limit rates, making commuting to and from North County much less of a 
hassle. 
</P>
<P>
North County is growing at an alarming rate, adding more and more traffic to 
compound the problem. The ultimate completion of the North County trolley 
extension will offer a partial solution, but this is still in the future. Now 
is when we need full utilization of all our roads. 
</P>
<P>
No one wants a Los Angeles-style spaghetti tangle of crisscrossing roads, nor 
do we want their hours-long daily work commutes, which seems to be the way 
we're headed. 
</P>
<P>
There's a salt-in-the-wound effect on frustrated drivers caught in the 
stop-and-slow traffic of I-15 who see beside them the forbidden lanes begging 
to be used -- lanes bought and paid for out of their own tax money. 
</P>
<P>
The aim of the expressway, and the promise, was to alleviate traffic congestion 
on I-15 between Kearny Mesa and Penasquitos. Opening the lanes to everyone 
would fulfill both the purpose and promise of this stretch of highway -- the 
lanes would finally have maximum use, justifying the $31.4-million expense, and 
the goal of smoothing North San Diego's workday commuting hassle would have 
been met.

AN ALARMING TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This Tuesday, for the first time, candidates for San Diego City Council will be 
running for office under a "district only" format, meaning that candidates will 
be elected exclusively by voters living within a candidate's home council 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Before this year, council candidates ran within the district in the September 
primary, with the top two vote-getters entering a citywide runoff election in 
November. But no more. Voter approval of Proposition E last November mandates 
that council members be elected solely by the district they seek to represent. 
</P>
<P>
Because this year's council elections are the first to be held under the new 
district-only format, we're not really sure what to expect. We do know that 
voter turnout in the past primary elections for these four council seats -- 
Districts 1, 3, 5 and 7 -- has shown a steady decline since the mid 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the last time these four seats were up for election, in 1985, voter 
turnout in the primary set an all-time low, at 16%. The election before that, 
in 1981, was only slightly better, with a turnout of 22.5%. This decline 
parallels voter turnout trends in California and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
This gradual, but unrelenting, erosion in public participation is cause for 
alarm. Passive acceptance of a system perceived to be working can be the 
beginning of the end of the historical reasons it was founded: freedom to 
exercise our vote, to preserve our liberties, rights and privileges.

THE JEWELS OF AVALON; 
</P>
<P>
WITH ITS COLORFUL, DISTINCTIVE DESIGN, CATALINA TILE HAS BECOME A HOT 
COLLECTOR'S ITEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catalina blue. Descanso green. Toyon red. Manchu yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Decorative tile in those shimmering hues is almost everywhere the eye alights 
in Avalon -- its primitive-style artwork defining and highlighting the Santa 
Catalina Island town. 
</P>
<P>
Once produced in a factory on the island, Catalina tile adorns the serpentine 
wall that snakes along Crescent Avenue, the Wrigley Memorial and Botanical 
Gardens, the old Bird Park aviary, benches, storefronts, fountains and numerous 
homes and buildings around the town. 
</P>
<P>
"Tile is really the jewelry of the city of Avalon," said Richard Thomas Keit, a 
ceramic artist from Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most distinctive architectural embellishment in town," said Keit, who 
has reproduced the tile's distinctive styles and colors in restoration projects 
for various buildings around town, including a striking 18-foot-tall mermaid 
mural at the entrance to the Casino Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
For only a decade, from 1927 to 1937, functional tile and decorative pottery 
were produced by residents at the Catalina Clay Products Co., where as many as 
70 workers were employed, doing everything from collecting red clay from pits 
in the rugged interior to designing shapes and mixing colors, forming the clay 
into square tile or distinctly shaped pottery, firing it in kilns, and selling 
it at local tourist shops. 
</P>
<P>
Today the pottery has become a collector's item, prized by aficionados for its 
distinctive glaze and colors. Around Avalon, most of the tiles are authentic 
but some, succumbing to age or the elements, have been replaced by high-quality 
reproductions. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Catalina decorative tiles depict pastoral island scenes or animals, 
most commonly brightly colored fish or birds, as in the murals at Bird Park. 
Other tiles are molded into abstract or Moorish-style patterns, in rounded or 
star-like shapes. Many emulate the Art-Deco style in vogue in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"The pottery," as the company was commonly known among islanders, had modest 
intentions when it was begun by chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. through 
his Santa Catalina Island Co. The Wrigley family, which bought the 
76-square-mile island through the company in 1919, deeded about 86% of it to 
the nonprofit Catalina Conservancy in 1975. Today, the company still owns about 
two-thirds of the land in Avalon and about 20% of the town's buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The pottery's primary goals were to manufacture construction materials for the 
growing town -- which was booming after its incorporation in 1914 -- and to 
provide employment for islanders during the Depression, said Lee Rosenthal, a 
board member of the Healdsburg, Calif.-based Tile Heritage Foundation. 
Rosenthal has researched the history of Catalina tile and pottery. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Renton, who started working for the island company in 1929, said he 
helped oversee the pottery and other Wrigley operations. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Wrigley was trying to make the island as self-sufficient as possible," 
said Renton. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Lopez, 77, an island native who still lives there, was one of those 
employees. In 1930, fresh out of Avalon High School, she accepted a job as a 
finisher at the factory to collect a $16 weekly paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
"I was glad to get it," said Lopez. Her job involved lifting tiles and pottery 
into and out of the kiln and occasionally helping designers hand-paint scenes 
onto the pottery. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of fun but a lot of hard work," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which was located on Pebbly Beach Road, concentrated at first on 
turning out roof and floor tiles, bricks and drainage tiles that were used in 
the construction of the Casino Ballroom, other Avalon buildings and Wrigley 
family homes and projects in Long Beach and in Phoenix, Ariz., Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
Around the early 1930s, the company began manufacturing decorative pottery, 
including festively decorated jars, vases, dinnerware and pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"The pottery was almost a cottage industry," Rosenthal said. "The islanders 
were employed throughout the Depression; it was something that kept the island 
going, and it was profitable for Wrigley." 
</P>
<P>
Back then, the wares could be found at local tourist shops for a few dollars. 
The pottery was also shipped to the mainland for distribution to department 
stores nationwide, where, along with other California pottery, its bold colors 
and graphics proved a hit with consumers accustomed to the delicate patterns of 
fine imported china. 
</P>
<P>
In 1937, however, the Wrigleys decided to sell the company, although the 
reasons for that decision have been obscured over the years. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rosenthal, it was learned in the early 1930s that the red clay on 
the island was not hard enough to be durable, so the company had begun 
importing a white clay from Lincoln, Calif. That proved to be too expensive, so 
the Wrigleys decided to sell the company to the Gladding McBean pottery, a 
large factory on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
With the purchase of the company, Gladding McBean also acquired the rights to 
its molds, and continued to make the pottery under the Catalina name, said Bill 
Wyatt, the plant historian for Gladding McBean. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said Catalina pottery was produced on the mainland for about two 
years, although it was marked "Catalina Island Pottery," rather than "Catalina" 
or "Catalina Island," as it was marked when made on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Williamson, an Avalon collector who coordinates a display of the pottery 
at the Santa Catalina Island Co., said a combination of factors contributed to 
the pottery firm's demise, including a waning interest in Southwestern and Art 
Deco-influenced design. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of potteries at the time were faltering and going by the wayside," 
Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forgotten Treasures 
</P>
<P>
Although the tile remained highly visible on buildings, Catalina pottery was 
largely forgotten as the years went by, tucked away in the back of cabinets, 
packed up in boxes or given away. 
</P>
<P>
"Locals didn't think much about it," Williamson said. "It was in their 
cupboards, and their mothers had it and their grandmothers had it, and nobody 
thought of it becoming a collector's item." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said she collected a few pieces during her three years as a tile company 
employee, but didn't give much thought to their value. 
</P>
<P>
"I foolishly gave it all away, because I went into the service and I didn't 
know if I would come back," Lopez recalls. "It was one of those things you 
didn't think was going to be that valuable." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the tiles are back in vogue, historians and dealers say, and the increase 
in interest has led to escalating demand -- and prices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deep-Rooted Nostalgia' 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a general increase in all the California pottery from that 
period," said Keit, the ceramic artist whose interest in tiles began during 
visits to Avalon as a boy, when he would make pencil rubbings of the elaborate 
patterns. "It's kind of a deep-rooted nostalgia for something of aesthetic 
value that has a local cultural significance to it." 
</P>
<P>
The prices now commanded for Catalina pottery once used as everyday dinnerware 
are astounding to some longtime islanders. 
</P>
<P>
A price list published by the company on Sept. 15, 1930, listed 6-by-6-inch 
decorated glazed tiles for sale at 25 cents each, plates for about $2, and 
vases from $1 to about $20, said Joe Taylor, president of the Tile Heritage 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Now, some vases are as much as $100, collectors and dealers say, and rare 
items, like a casino-shaped candy box or elaborate plates decorated with 
raised-relief sea horses or marlins, cost as much as $1,000. A 6-by-6-inch tile 
can cost $100 or more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hot collector's item, people are scrambling, the prices are 
outrageous," said Patricia Moore, director and curator of the Catalina Island 
Museum, which maintains an exhibit of Catalina pottery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aficionados on Lookout 
</P>
<P>
At a popular pottery sale and exhibition at the Glendale Civic Auditorium each 
year, "people are running around like crazy trying to collect all the Catalina 
(pottery) they can," Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
Al Nobel, who produces the Glendale pottery show, scheduled for Oct. 21 and 22, 
said the demand for Catalina and other American art pottery, as it is called, 
"has just gone ape" in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody could have cared less" in the late 1960s, but now, Nobel said, "I can't 
believe the prices of the things." 
</P>
<P>
Among the most sought-after items in the Catalina line are wooden and 
wrought-iron tables, whose tops are embedded with the tiles. Such tables cost 
about $25 when they were manufactured, but now sell for $1,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Le Masurier, co-owner of Keith's Pottery in Manhattan Beach, said it is 
difficult even to find original pottery in antique shops today. 
</P>
<P>
The tiles are so renowned and so valuable that some people go to illegal 
lengths to get them. 
</P>
<P>
At the Bird Park aviary, for example, which once housed a collection of exotic 
birds, tiles have been chipped away by would-be collectors. At the Catalina 
Visitor's Country Club, one valuable tile was even torn out of the wall of the 
men's room, said Taylor, of the Tile Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Often, such purloined tiles are damaged and prove unmarketable, collectors say. 
</P>
<P>
"People make what I think is the unmistakably stupid mistake of trying to pry 
tiles off the wall with screwdrivers," artist Keit said. "It's a real shame." 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of losing bits of history to vandalism is "really scary," Taylor 
said. "I think people who live on the island are very respectful of what they 
have and what their traditions are. . . . It's probably just tourists who are 
coming on the island for the weekend and cruising around." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Much to Protect 
</P>
<P>
Because the tile is so ubiquitous in Avalon and is, in effect, public art on so 
many buildings around town, collectors and historians fear there is little that 
can be done to prevent attempts to pry it from buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Its monetary value aside, sentimentality toward Catalina may also contribute to 
the pottery's popularity among collectors and tourists alike. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Catalina is one of those places that is somewhat romantic and people 
that go there have a good time," Rosenthal said. "A lot of them like to have 
something that's from the island that brings back good memories."

DOCTOR ACCUSED OF FINANCIAL FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government has charged Dr. Irving M. Cohen, 43, with eight felony 
counts in connection with false financial statements allegedly filed with four 
federally insured banks. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, a Del Mar resident, failed to report "substantial outstanding loans" 
which he previously had received from other banks, Assistant U.S. Atty. William 
Q. Hayes said Friday. Cohen subsequently received or renewed eight loans that 
totaled more than $500,000 from First National Bank, San Diego Trust &amp; 
Savings, Torrey Pines Bank and Bank of Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen faces a maximum of two years and a $250,000 fine for each of the eight 
offenses.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: TWO BROKEN LEGS AND A HARROWING BRUSH WITH DEATH CONVINCE 
A NOVICE SKY DIVER THAT HE CHOSE THE WRONG SPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
From his hospital bed, with both legs in casts, rookie sky diver Richard 
Leishman laughs about the moment in the Utah skies when his parachute failed to 
open fully. 
</P>
<P>
He was 4,000 feet above farmland of the Beehive State. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not mentally with it at that particular time," the Torrance resident 
recalled with a giggle. 
</P>
<P>
But it was no laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
"My instructor kept talking to me on a one-way radio set. I thought I was going 
to land fine. I knew I was going a little fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although his chute eventually opened almost all the way, its lines remained 
tangled and Leishman was unable to avoid a 15-foot ravine. He slammed into its 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
The impact broke both legs below the knees. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just flopping around any which way when I rolled or slid down the 
hill," he said. "I was not a happy camper." 
</P>
<P>
The event that ended his summer vacation began when some friends in Utah urged 
Leishman to try sky-diving. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like something fun to do. Then it came to the point of whether I 
could do it or not. Everyone has that fear of whether you will physically do 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conquering that fear was "the only macho thing involved," he said. "I wouldn't 
go out risking my neck if I thought I was going to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Leishman, who works for Hughes Aircraft Co., took a four-hour course from a 
sky-diving firm called Cedar Valley Free Fall. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 a.m. on Aug. 9, he strapped on a navy-blue and gray parachute, climbed 
into a Piper aircraft and took off from the Cedar Valley Airport. At 9,000 
feet, he and two instructors jumped, free-falling about 5,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of neat. It was different. . . . The fun part of sky-diving is 
free fall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His instructors, in accordance with their plan, pulled the rip cord to open 
Leishman's parachute. "It opened, but it didn't really open all the way. It had 
twisted lines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To say that Leishman tried to remember what he had learned is an 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
"They teach how to get out of twisted lines, but it didn't work," he said. "If 
it was just twisted lines, I would have gotten them out. There must have been 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Guthrie, the chief instructor for Cedar Valley Free Fall, said: "We will 
never know what happened." He said that Leishman could have avoided injury by 
following radioed instructions to cut his main chute clear and switch to the 
reserve chute. 
</P>
<P>
But Leishman continued to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"At 100 above the Earth, he had a collapsed parachute," Guthrie said, "At 50 
feet, the parachute got inflated again. He is the luckiest person on earth." 
</P>
<P>
The final twist was landing in the ravine. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened could not be duplicated," Guthrie said. "This ravine is the only 
obstacle in miles and miles of flat farm land," and if he hadn't smacked 
against the wall he probably would have come away unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the accident, Leishman has become the hot topic at at 
American Fork Hospital in Lehi, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the physical therapists was in the area and he saw me coming down and 
he saw me land. He thought I had died" in the fall, Leishman said. The 
therapist told Leishman later that seeing the accident had "had ruined his day, 
because he (thought he) had watched someone die. Then the next day he came to 
work and I was a celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
His friends at Hughes, where Leishman works in inventory control, spread the 
word too. 
</P>
<P>
"My boss called me twice in the last two days and cussed me out because he 
needs me at work," Leishman said. "I would much rather be at work than a 
celebrity in a hospital bed." 
</P>
<P>
Leishman, a bicyclist and runner, said he will stick to those sports when his 
casts come off in six months. 
</P>
<P>
He said nothing like the accident had ever happened to him before, even during 
service with the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through boot camp and didn't get hurt," Leishman. "I have learned my 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"No-o-o, this kid is not going sky-diving again." George Stein

WORK TO BEGIN ON P.V. DRIVES INTERSECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A four-month project to improve traffic safety at the busy and hazardous 
triangle intersection of Palos Verdes drives West and North in Palos Verdes 
Estates begins this week. Crews are scheduled to work weekdays from 7 a.m. to 
3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director Cathy Reed said traffic will be kept flowing during 
construction along one lane entering the city southbound from Torrance and 
another lane going northbound into Torrance. Delays are possible, however, in 
the intersection that links the peninsula to traffic bound for the beach cities 
and points north. 
</P>
<P>
The $555,206 project is being undertaken to reconfigure two consecutive curves 
in Palos Verdes Drive that have different arcs. The inconsistent curves force 
drivers to readjust their steering wheels. They will be realigned into a single 
continuous curve with the same arc. A median will be added to keep cars from 
crossing into opposing lanes, where there have been head-on collisions. 
</P>
<P>
According to the city, the triangle, which is next to Malaga Cove Plaza and 
carries 32,000 cars a day, was the scene of two traffic fatalities and 71 other 
accidents between 1981 and 1983. The fatalities and the most serious accidents 
occurred on the curves. 
</P>
<P>
A second, $1.9-million phase of the project calls for construction of an 
overpass at the triangle, where the two Palos Verdes drives and Via Chico 
intersect. The bridge will carry northbound traffic headed for Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said the City Council has approved the bridge concept, but work has not 
been scheduled because the council is reviewing priorities of all capital 
improvement programs. She said the city must also determine the ability of 
earthen ramps to support the bridge.

UNIDENTIFIED BODY FOUND IN HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters, responding to a house fire Thursday night in East San Diego, 
discovered a man's badly burned body in a rear bedroom, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified man was 6 feet tall and weighed 171 pounds, said Cal Vine, 
deputy coroner. 
</P>
<P>
It took 22 firefighters more than four hours to contain the blaze at 7739 
Shorewood Drive, which began at 9:54 p.m. Thursday, fire Capt. Allan Macdonald 
said. An investigation revealed that the fire had been deliberately set by 
someone who spread flammable liquid throughout the house and ignited it, said 
Detective John Buono of the Metro Arson Strike Team. Homicide detectives are 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the single-story, wood house was estimated at $50,000, Macdonald 
said.

<P>
The badly decomposed body of an adult woman was found Saturday along a rural 
portion of San Pasqual Road in the northeastern corner of San Diego, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detectives said the body was partially covered and lying on top of a 
drainage ditch. A coroner's autopsy is scheduled.

AMERICANS FERRY, SHAW TAKE A ROMAN HOLIDAY BY PLAYING IN ITALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ROME 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under a full moon on Piazza Navona, hundreds of people were engaged in Rome's 
most popular entertainment, watching each other. Most watched among them were 
two innocents abroad, Danny Ferry and Brian Shaw, who have been here scarcely a 
month but already are known to every friend, Roman and countryman old enough to 
lend their eyes to the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Their pictures are in one of them, Il Messaggero, almost daily. That is the 
newspaper that sponsors the basketball team they play for in the Italian 
League, which is not to be confused with a National Basketball Assn. or even 
the Continental Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
As Ferry, Shaw and a small entourage selected an outdoor table at a popular 
restaurant, La Maiella, an excited maitre d' hustled to find the owner. 
Overjoyed to have Rome's latest star attractions at his restaurant, the owner 
said that the chef would prepare any dish they desired. He, however, suggested 
the linguine pescadora. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after the linguine pescadora had been cleaned from their plates, the 
maitre d' returned to the table with a suggestion of his own for Ferry and 
Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
"Fate la bella figura," he said, which, roughly interpreted, means cut a fine 
swath. 
</P>
<P>
In case they did not understand, he interpreted for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning is not most important," he said in English. "It is style that is most 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw laughed, suddenly understanding the urgency behind the message that Il 
Messaggero's coach, Valerio Bianchini, has been trying for the last month to 
get across to his team, which, according to league rules, has only two 
non-Italians on its 12-man roster. Bianchini's message, hardly surprising 
coming from someone who fancies himself as the Italian Bob Knight, is that of 
the maitre d' in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always telling us, 'strength first, style second,' " Shaw said. "He says 
that's our owner's method. Strength first, style second." 
</P>
<P>
As director of a giant agricultural concern, Gruppa Ferruzzi, the team's owner, 
Raul Gardini, is one of Italy's richest men. One story told about him is of his 
quest to buy a magnificent palace on Venice's Grand Canal that was owned by an 
insurance company. Repeatedly spurned, he finally bought the insurance company. 
It was in that palace that Ferry's head would be turned toward Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry's first contact with Il Messaggero came on the night of the NBA draft at 
New York, where the Clippers had made the 6-foot-10 forward from Duke the 
league's second choice. Torn between celebrating because he was drafted so high 
and agonizing because of the team that drafted him, he was walking with some 
friends down Seventh Avenue toward a restaurant when he noticed a man following 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to make sure, I sped up," Ferry said. "He sped up. I slowed down. He 
slowed down." 
</P>
<P>
Ferry had reason to believe that the man was not a mugger. He was only about 
5-8, in his mid-40s and wore thick glasses. But just as Ferry was about to 
confront him, the man stepped forward and introduced himself as Valerio 
Bianchini, coach of Il Messaggero, whose owner, Gardini, wanted to make Ferry 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
Politely, Ferry told Bianchini to call his father, Bob, who is general manager 
of the NBA's Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Ferry and his father were having lunch in Washington with the 
international director of Gruppa Ferruzzi. Ferry was supposed to leave within a 
few days for England, where he would attend Wimbledon and see his college 
friend, Paul Stewart, the son of Formula One driver Jackie Stewart, start his 
own racing career. The man from Gruppa Ferruzzi persuaded Ferry to fly first to 
Venice to see Gardini and bring his parents along. 
</P>
<P>
Gardini put them up at one of the world's most elegant hotels, the Gritti 
Palace overlooking Piazza San Marco. He gave them the run of his son-in-law's 
world-renowned restaurant, Harry's Bar, and invited them to his own palace on 
the Grand Canal. "It was like a museum," Ferry said, still wide-eyed when he 
recalled it recently. 
</P>
<P>
Before putting Ferry on a plane for England, and Ferry's parents on a plane for 
a weekend at Monte Carlo, Gardini made an offer. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry had heard about Gardini's offers. On behalf of Ferruzzi, he once tried to 
buy out a company for $322 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We need time to think," the company's owner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Take all the time you need," Gardini told them. "You have 22 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Strength first, style second. They sold, with several minutes to spare. 
</P>
<P>
When Ferry heard Gardini's offer, he said, "I'll need more than 22 minutes." 
Gardini laughed. 
</P>
<P>
But Ferry actually did not need much more time than that. For one thing, he 
believed that the offer was better than he could expect from the Clippers, or 
from any other NBA team for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
It was not so long ago that the average salary in the Italian League was less 
than $40,000. Within the last decade, some foreigners, primarily Americans, 
have begun commanding six figures. But it was only recently that a few of the 
better Italians have been able to earn that much. 
</P>
<P>
The league's salaries, however, might escalate significantly with the addition 
of owners such as Gardini. While most of Italy's wealthy sportsmen have bought 
into soccer, the country's most popular sport by far, Gardini this year became 
the first among the super-rich to own a basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
He quickly sent a message to his fellow owners, and perhaps to the NBA, that he 
was going to play this new game above the rim. His offer to Ferry was close to 
$10 million for five years. Guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
That last word was important to Ferry. When he injured his knee in a workout 
two days before the second phase of the Olympic Trials last summer, he saw his 
career flash before his eyes. The injury did not prove to be serious, but it 
made him consider how he would provide for himself without basketball. 
</P>
<P>
He also had been envious of his friends at Duke who studied abroad. He had 
played an overseas tournament and tours every summer since he was a senior at 
Washington's De Matha High School, but that was not like living in a foreign 
country. A political science major, he had every intention of playing in Europe 
after he was finished in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Gardini made that possible before Ferry started in the NBA. And there was even 
an escape clause. Ferry had the option to leave after each year of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Even before he had an agent, without negotiating with the Clippers, Ferry 
decided that he would play in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, people can say I stuck it to the Clippers," he said. "But I was very 
honest with them all along, and they were very honest with me all along. They 
could have handled it well, or they could have handled it bad, and they handled 
it with a lot of class. 
</P>
<P>
But for the duration of this season, he said that he definitely has committed 
to Rome. Once that was settled, Gardini dispatched Bianchini to find a guard to 
get the ball to Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
Before Ferry was approached, there were preliminary discussions about bringing 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Rome. Abdul-Jabbar's Los Angeles agent, Leonard Armato, 
said that Abdul-Jabbar was not interested. But Armato listened when Bianchini 
called later about another client, Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
As a first-round draft choice in 1988 out of UC Santa Barbara, Shaw earned 
$150,000 as a rookie. Although he started 52 games as a 6-6 point guard, he 
said that the Celtics at first offered him only $250,000 for this season. 
</P>
<P>
Then Il Messaggero offered him $1 million a year for two years, with an option 
to leave after the first year. But the team gave him only four days to decide. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the Celtics offer was after that," he said. "Everything 
moved so fast. But I don't think they ever believed I was serious as far as the 
offer to come over here goes. I was." 
</P>
<P>
So here were Ferry and Shaw, having finished dinner and continued their stroll 
across Piazza Navona. Adults stared, street artists offered to draw their 
pictures, children asked for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
Even though they were the attraction, Ferry was attracted to some of the other 
people in the Plaza, the young women. He joked that he recently turned his 
ankle by running into a curb because he was looking in another direction 
besides the one where he was headed. Shaw was not similarly distracted, 
presumably because he was with his girlfriend, Lori Butler of West Hollywood. 
They met at UCSB. 
</P>
<P>
All three plan to enroll soon in Italian classes. About the only words Ferry 
and Shaw know so far, compliments of their mischievous teammates, cannot be 
printed in Il Messaggero. They also are brushing up on art, history and 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"My father told me to make sure I didn't come back and have nothing to talk 
about but basketball and beautiful women," said Shaw, a sociology major. "He 
said this was an opportunity that most Americans can only dream about and that 
I should make the most of it." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip to Pisa, Ferry worried about leaning too far off the leaning 
tower. "At 6-10 you wouldn't think I'd be scared of heights," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is scared by Ferry's driving in Rome, where rules of the road often 
are nothing more than suggestions. "Somebody told Danny that there are no 
driving rules in Rome, and he took that literally," said Greg Ballard, a former 
forward with the Bullets and Warriors who is an assistant coach with Il 
Messaggero. "I won't ride with him without a crash helmet and a blindfold." 
</P>
<P>
Both Ferry and Shaw are driving BMWs that were loaned to them by the team, but 
Gardini has promised to buy them any car of their choice. Almost any car. They 
asked for Ferraris. "He told us to come see him after we win three Italian 
League championships and three Italian cups," Ferry said. 
</P>
<P>
The team also will provide them with apartments in the city when they can find 
time to look for them. So far, they have been too busy with the opening of Cup 
play, exhibition games and two-a-day workouts in preparation for the Sept. 24 
start of the regular season. Meantime, they are living in an expensive 
four-star hotel, where Ferry already has been scolded by the management for 
putting his feet on a 300-year-old coffee table in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
There is so much to learn, such as to look at prices before ordering. On the 
trendy Via Veneto, Ferry, Shaw and Butler recently spent $6 apiece for ice 
cream. They had never paid so much for ice cream. Then again, they might never 
have had ice cream that was so tasty. This is indeed La Dolce Vita. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the jobs? 
</P>
<P>
Playing in the Italian League is not like playing The Palace, even when The 
Palace is the one in Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Il Messaggero plays in the 15,000-seat Olympic arena, where Jerry West, Oscar 
Robertson and Jerry Lucas led the United States to a 1960 Olympic gold medal, 
and has its own jet. But it still has to take some three or four-hour bus rides 
to towns with 4,000-seat gymnasiums and fans that make pro wrestling crowds 
seem like opera lovers. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few outstanding teams. With Bob McAdoo as its leading scorer, 
Philips Milan is the defending league champion. Darren Daye, formerly of UCLA, 
and Darwin Cook, formerly of the University of Portland, are expected to team 
with Italian forwards Walter Magnifico to make Scavolini Pesaro a contender 
this season. Micheal Ray Richardson and Clemon Johnson play for Knorr Bologna. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, Ballard, who played two years in the Italian League before 
becoming an assistant coach, compared the level of play to that of small 
colleges in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In last Tuesday night's opener of the Cup, a double round-robin tournament that 
runs concurrently with the regular season, Ferry and Shaw tired to work their 
Il Messaggero teammates into the offense against an inferior team from Livorno. 
But when Il Messaggero fell behind by 10 points early in the second half, Ferry 
and Shaw took over. They scored 22 of the teams last 30 points in a 91-90 
victory. Ferry finished with 30 points and nine rebounds, Shaw with 23 points 
and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Bianchini was disturbed by his players' tendency to stand and watch 
when either Ferry or Shaw had the ball. In their defense, Livorno's players 
displayed the same tendency. There were 181 points scored in 40 minutes. The 
same length as a college game, which says something about the defense played in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very spoiled by watching the Americans, like Bob McAdoo," Bianchini 
said. "Everyone knows he is a shooting machine and not any other thing. But in 
the case of Danny and Brian, we have to move without the ball because they will 
find the open man. There is much we can learn from them because they are the 
type players who share their knowledge and make their teammates better." 
</P>
<P>
But what can Ferry and Shaw learn from playing in Italy? 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely going to help their development, particularly offensively," 
Ballard said. "They might think they're being selfish by scoring 25 and 30 
points a game, but that's what they're paid to do. Shoot and score. 
</P>
<P>
"So when they go back to the States, they're going to think more offensively, 
even when they're double-teamed, and that's going to be good for them in the 
NBA." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said that Boston Coach Jimmy Rodgers told him to work during the 
off-season on posting up smaller guards. At 6-6, playing against some Italian 
guards who would have to wear high heels to reach 6-0, Shaw should have plenty 
of practice at that before going back to the NBA, perhaps to the Celtics. They 
still own his rights. 
</P>

"From a business point of view, I did what I had to do," he said. "Once I made 
that decision, I wanted to make the best of it. I think the Celtics understand. 
I let them know that I do want to come back. Hopefully, we can make things work 
out next year." 
</P>
<P>
As for Ferry, he said that he might play in Rome for two or three years. Or he 
might decide to play in the NBA next season. It depends on whether he is 
content here and the situation at home. He said that he was only mildly 
interested when he heard last week that the Clippers were listening to offers 
for him from Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have anything against the Clippers," he said. "I'd play for them. It's 
not the perfect situation, but I'd do it. It's just that I'm not sure what they 
have in mind for me. I still think they want to trade me. The only thing I know 
for sure is that I want to play in the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, he said that he has no regrets. "I haven't heard one person say that 
they feel sorry for me," he said.

REDSKINS GO ON DEFENSIVE ABOUT THEIR LINE PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Although they aren't quite cocky enough to come out and say it, the 
Philadelphia Eagles apparently believe they will be able to exploit the middle 
of the Redskins' defense when they visit Washington's RFK Stadium this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sensation the Redskins can readily understand, given their yield of 394 
yards, 159 of them rushing, in Monday's 27-24 loss to the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"They should be feeling that way; if they saw films of the Giants' game, it 
stands to reason they'd think that way," linebacker coach Larry Peccatiello 
said at Redskin Park. "We didn't do a good job in the middle of our defense 
against the run." 
</P>
<P>
But the performance has not caused the Redskins to look elsewhere for help. 
"Defensive linemen are always thin (in quantity ) and we just feel we can go 
with what we have," General Manager Charley Casserly said. "We need to play 
better than we did the other night, and I'm sure we will play better. But right 
now the plan is to go with what's here and we'll evaluate at the end of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins have a pair of rookie linemen, Lybrant Robinson and Pat Marbatt, 
on the six-man developmental squad, but either would have to pass through 
waivers before being activated. Earlier this week, Washington brought in at 
least two linemen, 33-year-old Mike Stensrud, who has played with Houston and 
Kansas City, and Nate Hill for tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's game, middle linebacker Neal Olkewicz had four tackles and two 
assists, and defensive tackle Darryl Grant excelled with two tackles and 1 1/2 
sacks, but Markus Koch played virtually the entire game without a tackle during 
the humid, balmy evening. 
</P>
<P>
Koch has played with a dislocated knuckle in his left hand since late in the 
pre-season. The converted end, who appeared to be shouldering much of the blame 
for New York's success, declined to comment, joking that any talking he did 
would have to be in German. As it was, both teammates and coaches came to his 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't played Markus there much, but Monday wasn't one person's fault; it 
was team breakdown," said defensive-line coach Torgy Torgeson. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to perform better as a team and we're going to get the job done now," 
said defensive end Dexter Manley. "I truly believe that because I believe in my 
teammates. I'm sure the Eagles feel they can come right back and run against us 
because the Giants were successful at it. Fine. I'm supposed to be the weak one 
on the line, tell 'em to run at me, me and Darryl." 
</P>
<P>
Given the weather, it seemed natural that rookie defensive tackle Tracy Rocker 
would see plenty of action, but the third-round draft choice's activity was 
limited to occasional short-yardage and special-teams play. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have to wait for my turn," Rocker said. "I'm not upset or anything, the 
guys that were in there were doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Despite having players in for a look, the Redskins are not expected to make a 
roster move on the defensive line. "I'm concerned. We have to play better than 
we did last week," Coach Joe Gibbs said. "We didn't substitute too much; we 
were able to use some packages that gave the guys a rest when they needed it. 
We were going to do that anyway; right now we still have six healthy defensive 
linemen so we're okay. If it got down to four you'd be a little worried." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs and Torgeson felt that talk of vulnerability and short-handedness would 
be a moot point if the Redskins had played with more consistency against the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' 159 rushing yards and 4.3-yard-per-carry average were both higher 
than Washington's prescribed goals, but both coaches said the Redskins' defense 
was in control except for a few lapses that led to big plays. Gibbs said this 
is an area the Redskins were "trying to make a special emphasis." 
</P>
<P>
Some think the Eagles are intent on making quarterback Randall Cunningham a 
picture-perfect pocket passer. That could work in the Redskins' favor because, 
as evidenced by Cunningham's status as the team's leading rusher the last two 
seasons (the first quarterback to accomplish that since Green Bay's Tobin Rote 
in 1951-52), the rest of Philadelphia's ground game has been mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the same was being said about the Giants without the injured Joe 
Morris. But the Redskins say reputation won't matter as much as actual 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have better technique and just beat more blockers," Peccatiello 
said. "We just have to play better."

More than 1,000 New York Giants' season tickets have disappeared, but team 
officials say they won't know whether they were lost or stolen until the Giants 
home opener today. 
</P>
<P>
A truck delivering a box of tickets to the Meadowlands three weeks ago had made 
several stops on the way, and officials say the box might have fallen from the 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
The tickets, for seats throughout Giants Stadium, had already been purchased by 
season-ticket holders, team spokesman Ed Croke said. New color-coded tickets 
have been printed and sent to the ticket holders, he said.

Ten Welsh soccer fans were given 16-month prison sentences after being found 
guilty of a drunken rampage through an Athens suburb after their team lost a 
match. 
</P>
<P>
The supporters of the Welsh Swansea soccer club were still wearing the torn and 
bloodied clothes from their night of brawling when a three-judge court handed 
down the sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The court said the fans could buy off their sentences at $2.35 a day, or almost 
$1,240 for the full sentence. Four other accused Swansea supporters were freed 
by the court. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek public prosecutor said the drunken fans wrecked a restaurant, two 
bars and five cars during a rampage through the luxury seaside suburb of 
Glyfada near Athens. 
</P>
<P>
Each Swansea supporter was given a chance to defend himself before the court 
and all said they were innocent and had been attacked by a Greek mob. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Evans, 31, who was convicted, said: "We are not British hooligans. 
Swansea fans have the best reputation in Britain for good behavior."

Chip Hanauer, who will go for his eighth consecutive APBA Gold Cup victory 
today, broke the unlimited hydroplane records for one-and two-lap qualifying 
runs Saturday on the 2.5-mile Mission Bay course. 
</P>
<P>
Hanauer, of Seattle, piloted his Circus Circus turbine-powered boat to the 
fastest unlimited lap ever, 158.870 m.p.h. That bettered the record of 156.169 
set here last year by Tom D'Eath in the Miss Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
Hanauer's two-lap qualifying mark of 158.297 m.p.h. broke his old record of 
149.031 set here in 1987.

YOUNG VENEZUELAN MISSES L.A. DRAW, BUT HAS PROMISING FUTURE

<P>
Since this is his first visit to Los Angeles, Venezuelan Nicolas Pereira, 18, 
has made an itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of bars, a couple of beaches," Pereira said. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira turns 19 Tuesday and, though he still can't legally buy a drink, he 
will have plenty of time to roam the city. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira lost to Martin Barba, 6-3, 6-3, Saturday, failing to qualify for the 
$425,000 Volvo/Los Angeles tournament that begins Monday at the L.A. Tennis 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
His professional career has yet to reap many rewards, but Pereira remains a 
promising player. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 world junior champion, Pereira won the French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. 
Open junior titles, the first to win all three since Stefan Edberg in 1983. 
Edberg has gone on to win three Grand Slam titles, including Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira is finding success in the pros vastly more difficult than in the 
juniors, but he has some daunting weapons -- 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds with a 
deadly serve-and-volley game. 
</P>
<P>
He took No. 1-ranked Ivan Lendl to five sets in the first round at Wimbledon, 
but lost. Pereira also lost in the first round at the U.S. Open, to Danie 
Visser. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira's best results in his first year as a pro are reaching the 
quarterfinals at Tokyo and Montreal. His ranking, which he hopes to break into 
the 50s next year, is No. 101. 
</P>
<P>
"I am trying to keep everything together so I can get that one break," Pereira 
said. "I need to be more consistent, to keep the momentum up in a game and to 
learn to take the chances, to stay consistent in my head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance? 
</P>
<P>
"I might play a week, then take a week off and when I come back to play, my 
mind just flies away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He admires the classic serve-and-volley style of Boris Becker, Yannick Noah and 
John McEnroe, but also the fluid baseline grace of Mats Wilander. 
</P>
<P>
"You can find something interesting and useful in every tennis player," Pereira 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira, who started playing at age 6, has been coached by Colon Nunez for 
years. Pereira usually packs a guitar with him when he travels, but he left it 
at home this trip. 
</P>
<P>
And Nunez, Pereira's constant companion, is not with him either. This makes it 
more difficult for Pereira, but he has learned to expect it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard out here because all the players are so good," he said. "It seems 
like whatever you do, it's not enough. You don't have everything so sure. Not 
everybody can win every tournament, though. Whoever has the mental edge. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot more than just tennis to win." 
</P>
<P>
The new buzzword in tennis? After the U.S. Open, it's two words: muscle cramps. 
Painful leg muscle cramps, a heat disorder caused by loss of fluid and 
dehydration, affected Steffi Graf, Jimmy Connors and Jay Berger during their 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
Berger, in fact, had to default his quarterfinal match to Aaron Krickstein 
because he could not go on in the fourth set because of leg cramps. Graf feared 
she would lose her semifinal to Gabriela Sabatini because of thigh cramps and 
Connors nearly quit in his quarterfinal against Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
Why did all this happen? 
</P>
<P>
"No. 1, it was hot," said Beverly Hills physician Eli Ginzburg, a tennis player 
himself, who watched the cramps attack at the Open with interest. Ginzburg 
suggested that besides drinking lots of liquid, there is another way to help. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's always important to stretch leg muscles before the match," 
Ginzburg said. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in hot and humid weather and on the Open's heat-absorbing artificial 
surface was a powerful combination. Gary Wadler, the tournament physician, said 
that heat illness is common at the Open but might have seemed more prevalent 
this year because seeded players were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Wadler said he believes the key to avoiding heat illness and the muscle cramps 
that follow is simply to drink fluid before a match. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of taking fluids in advance of a match cannot be 
overemphasized," Wadler said. "I think the events of last week underscore how 
important that is." 
</P>
<P>
Whether tension or anxiety help bring on cramps has not been established, 
Wadler said. 
</P>
<P>
From 37-year-old Jimmy Connors about publicity: "If I don't win, I don't want 
to see my name in there just out of sensitivity toward me." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Ralston, 47, will coach French tennis star Yannick Noah full time. 
</P>
<P>
Noah said during the U.S. Open that Ralston had agreed to coach him, but he did 
not say to what extent. Noah reached the quarterfinals and lost to eventual 
champion Boris Becker, but his ranking improved nine spots to No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Ralston, a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, said the time was 
right for such a job because his children are grown and his wife would travel 
with him. Before Ralston began coaching him at the Open, Noah's ranking dropped 
to No. 23, his worst in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most interesting sidelights of the women's U.S. Open final was what 
Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova said about each other afterward. The 
conversation was conducted through the media, because Navratilova revealed that 
she and Graf do not talk to each other. 
</P>
<P>
It was a soft-core fight. Navratilova started the mud rolling when she 
questioned Graf's stoicism on court. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't show anything," Navratilova said. "I just hope she enjoys it. . . 
. I don't get any sense of emotion when she's playing. I'm sure that she's 
feeling something. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what she feels. I don't really speak to her that much, rather she 
doesn't speak to me. I don't have any idea what's going on in her mind or her 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
Then Navratilova outlined Graf's conversation practices. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't talk to anybody, really," Navratilova said. "She sort of runs in 
the locker room, changes real quick and doesn't talk to anybody. One player in 
the locker room was saying 'Come on, Steffi, smile.' She just ran out." 
</P>
<P>
OK, that's one version. Graf has another way of looking at it: Martina 32, 
Steffi 20. 
</P>
<P>
"I have friends (in the locker room)," Graf said. "I search for them in my age 
group and who I would have a good time talking to." 
</P>
<P>
Graf also insisted that if she didn't enjoy playing tennis she wouldn't do it 
and if that doesn't show, well, too bad. 
</P>
<P>
And as for not speaking with Navratilova, Graf had a comeback prepared: "She 
doesn't talk to me, either."

NBA MAY TINKER WITH THE LOTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

PALM SPRINGS, Calif.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cypress trees line the hotel driveway here at the NBA's annual league meetings. 
And most coaches and general managers are concerned with tee times, not 
collective-bargaining agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Only minor changes and adoptions are expected at these meetings, which run 
through Sunday. The biggest may be a revamping of the lottery system to give 
the truly bad teams more of an opportunity to get the top pick. Other changes 
may include changes in interpretation of the zone-defense rules. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, there's the desert heat to contend with, a few miles from the site 
of the Skins Game and the Bob Hope Desert Classic. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery move comes at a time when more than a third of the league's teams 
will be involved next year. With 11 non-playoff teams slated for it, the 
current system has a feeling of unwieldiness -- with each non-playoff team 
having an equal opportunity to obtain the top choice, as last year, when the 
Bullets could have either had the top pick or the ninth pick or one of several 
in between. 
</P>
<P>
At the draft lottery there was some question about the fairness of a system in 
which the consensus choice for worst team in the league -- Miami -- could slip 
down to No. 4. The Heat wound up picking behind Sacramento, the Los Angeles 
Clippers and San Antonio after it was not one of the top three teams chosen. 
</P>
<P>
The new system would run along the same lines as the NFL's supplemental draft. 
The worst team would have chances weighed in its favor by having its team 
represented more frequently. The worst team would have 11 chances, the next 
worst 10, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
All recommendations from the committees meeting here must be approved later by 
the NBA's Board of Governors.

USC, UCLA LOSSES MAY SIGNAL ARRIVAL OF NEW WAVE IN PAC-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Is it basketball season yet in the Pacific 10 Conference? 
</P>
<P>
How else do you explain Southern Cal losing a 13-point lead with six minutes 
left, and ultimately the game, to Illinois in its season opener Sept. 2? 
</P>
<P>
Or last Saturday, when UCLA lost, 24-6, to down-and-out Tennessee at the Rose 
Bowl? Both the Trojans and the Bruins were considered two of top 10 teams at 
the time, and both were expected to contend for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Those defeats have breathed new life into the conference's other teams, 
especially Oregon State and Washington State. Both teams are unbeaten going 
into Saturday's suddenly meaningful showdown in Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (the Beavers) can stay healthy, they can challenge for the Pac 10 
championship," said first-year Washington State Coach Mike Price, who took over 
when Dennis Erickson departed last spring for Miami. "If we can stay healthy, 
we can compete for the Pac 10 championship. The only difference between the 
haves and have-nots is depth." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State knows about being have-nots. The Beavers hadn't won back-to-back 
games in 11 years, and are looking to make it three straight for the first time 
since 1970. Oregon State has not gone to the Rose Bowl since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this marks the first time since 1915 that Oregon State and Washington 
State each will be unbeaten going into their annual game. 
</P>
<P>
A big reason for Washington State's early-season success is quarterback Brad 
Gossen. A junior, Gossen took over when Timm Rosenbach, the nation's leader 
last year in passing efficiency, put himself in the National Football League's 
supplemental draft. Gossen leads the country in passing efficiency, with 31 
completions in 49 attempts, five touchdowns, one interception and 605 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Southern Cal Coach Larry Smith wasn't happy with some of the things 
he saw during that nationally televised, 14-13 defeat to Illinois in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He will make some wholesale changes for Saturday's game against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
Included among the changes is the benching of starting halfback Aaron Emanuel 
and starting strong safety Cleveland Colter, a preseason All-American 
candidate. Smith also made two changes on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a long time before our offense gets back to where it was, maybe 
not even this year," said Smith. "It takes a long time to develop that synch. 
I'm not saying it's going to be miserable, but ... " 
</P>
<P>
The victory over UCLA gave the Tennessee program its most significant win, and 
much-maligned Johnny Majors his biggest boost, since the Volunteers pounded 
highly favored Miami in the 1986 Sugar Bowl. It took a lot of the preseason 
heat off Majors, whose team lost its first five last year and finished 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
"The past is the past," said Majors, whose Volunteers are 2-0 and ranked 17th 
entering Saturday's game against Duke. "We can't let anybody think about it. We 
need to be as hungry as we can be, because we have a lot of improvement to 
make." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Devils are 3-1 against Tennessee since Majors returned to Knoxville, 
Tenn., 13 years ago, and Duke Coach Steve Spurrier is 3-0 against Southeastern 
Conference teams. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC is 6-1 this year against non-conference opponents, and has five teams 
in The Associated Press top 25. Nine of the 10 teams received votes. 
</P>
<P>
It will be three years come December since Bobby Ross left Maryland for Georgia 
Tech -- with a short stop in Buffalo as the Bills' quarterback coach -- and it 
has becoming increasingly apparent that the former Terps coach made, at best, a 
questionable career decision. 
</P>
<P>
As bad as things are in College Park, Md., they are a great deal worse in 
Atlanta, where Tech has yet to win an Atlantic Coast Conference game under 
Ross. The Yellow Jackets, who lost, 38-28, last week to North Carolina State, 
will go for 15 straight ACC defeats Saturday at home against Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a big challenge," said Ross. "We go into the game feeling we can win. 
The game we already played shouldn't tear us down. We have to look to the 
positive and build from there." 
</P>
<P>
One thing has not changed since his days at Maryland. Ross is certain never to 
be on the list of the most quotable college football coaches. Then again, after 
Lou Holtz, it is a pretty short list. 
</P>
<P>
Though Holtz is eminently quotable, he is a master of double talk. Before the 
Kickoff Classic two weeks ago, the Notre Dame coach was asked about how tough a 
game he expected from Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a very good team," Holtz said of the Cavaliers, who would lose to the 
top-ranked Fighting Irish, 36-13. "They beat Clemson last year, and Clemson 
beat Oklahoma in the Citrus Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Asked earlier this week for his reaction to Virginia's upset last Saturday at 
Penn State, and how the Nittany Lions might stack up later in the year against 
Notre Dame, Holtz said, "I never compare scores of games." 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers, after getting scored on the first five times Notre Dame had the 
ball, haven't given up a touchdown for six quarters 
</P>
<P>
How young a team does Mack Brown have at North Carolina? In the Tar Heels' 
season-opening rout of VMI, 29 North Carolina players were making their 
collegiate debuts. 
</P>
<P>
Before the season began, the Florida State-LSU matchup in Baton Rouge, La., 
appeared to be one of those games that would have a big impact on this season's 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it won't make a dent. That is the result of two straight defeats for the 
Seminoles (to Southern Mississippi and Clemson) and LSU's season-opening loss 
at Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
"The game has taken on a whole new look since the beginning of the year, when 
it looked like the game of the century," said Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden. 
'But it still ought to be a heck of a game." 
</P>
<P>
But will anybody watch (on ESPN)? 
</P>
<P>
Indiana tailback Anthony Thompson, one of those mentioned prominently for this 
year's Heisman Trophy, is the only active collegiate player listed in a recent 
book called "NCAA Legends." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson did not add to that legend last weekend. Though he rushed for 117 
yards in a 17-14 season-opening defeat against Kentucky, Thompson was stopped 
trying to go over the top of the goal line in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats, who led the country in graduation rate last year, have a chance 
to go 2-0 this week against North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday's nationally televised game between woeful Wisconsin and powerful 
Miami drew a crowd of 38,000 in Madison, the lowest single-game attendance 
there since 1968. Last year's game against Western Michigan drew 830 more 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Through last weekend, the nation's field-goal kickers seemed to be making the 
adjustment of going without a tee. More than 70 percent of field-goal tries 
have been successful, better than the season high of 68.2 set in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Quote of the Week: "They were clearly such a dominant team over us, it's 
frightening. Either they have been greatly miscalculated, or this might be the 
poorest team we've had here," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue after his Bruins lost to 
Tennessee.

NORTH CAROLINA ST. TRIES TO REGAIN SOLID FOOTING IN SOME SHAKY TIMES 
</P>

<P>
Sitting in his narrow, fourth-floor Williams Hall office, stacked high with 
books with titles such as "Methods of Enzymology," Professor Raymond Long tried 
to explain why many North Carolina State University faculty members think 
basketball coach Jim Valvano should be asked to take his show elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a feeling that it's a bit of contradiction for him to remain as coach 
when the chancellor (Bruce R. Poulton) has resigned because of problems 
occurring in his basketball program," said Long, chairman of the faculty senate 
and a professor of crop science, specializing in tobacco. "You can see the 
argument." 
</P>
<P>
This town and this state have been immersed in a swirl of emotional arguments 
for nine months. The debate centers on Valvano's program and his players, whose 
performance in the NCAA tournament has been found to have been better than its 
showing in the classroom and at commencement. 
</P>
<P>
And now there are NCAA violations to be answered and penalties loom on the 
horizon. The university's top official is already out. Valvano will soon 
relinquish his athletic director's post as he was asked to. Who will be next, 
who will replace them all, and will Valvano be part of N.C. State's future? 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that it's unsettled," said senior associate athletic 
director Frank Weedon. "But steps are being taken to correct the situation ... 
the search for an interim athletic director and a full-time athletic director 
will solve the problems. But right now, I wouldn't call them normal 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began in January, when the Raleigh News and Observer published 
details contained in a jacket for author Peter Golenbock's book, which include 
allegations that players received payments and privileges from boosters and 
improper grade changes were made. Talk of a lawsuit led to Golenbock's being 
forced to find another publisher, but the book, "Personal Fouls," hit the 
shelves in July and is now a national best-seller. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NCAA and a special commission conducted investigations and the 
chancellor resigned. Those inquiries found some NCAA violations, though not to 
the extent discussed in the book. There also was some serious twisting of 
academic rules to keep players eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Some, including former player Bennie Bolton, say Valvano is interested solely 
in himself and winning, and will do what is necessary to achieve that. Others 
argue that N.C. State needed a "charisma bypass," as one Valvano supporter put 
it, and that Valvano's vitality spread through the athletic department to the 
rest of the university, with mostly positive effects on both. 
</P>
<P>
Some think Valvano will survive the turmoil and remain at N.C. State in order 
to repair his reputation and the school's. Some think the school may ask him to 
leave, and others think he'll jump at the first good job -- coaching or 
broadcasting -- that comes along. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to point out that I'm not a man without options -- that I want 
very much to be here," Valvano said at the time of the Poole Commission, which 
called for him to step down as athletic director. "I would like very much the 
opportunity to show and to prove that we can, in fact we will, get the job done 
off the court with the help of a great many people. 
</P>
<P>
"We all must accept the responsibility of both our positions and either of our 
actions or lack of same. I have no other goal but to run our basketball program 
in a way that would be absolutely beyond reproach. We have had a problem here 
which is well-documented. I accept the responsibility for it and the 
accountability, and the players do also. Yes, changes have to be made. We're 
very committed to it." 
</P>
<P>
Still many think it was only Valvano's contract, which includes a $500,000 
buyout clause if he goes to another school, that kept him from taking the UCLA 
job in 1988 when there wasn't a hint of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
As Long said, "The final chapter in this has yet to be written." 
</P>
<P>
Around Raleigh even some of Valvano's detractors don't think much of 
Golenbock's book. During a lull in the N.C. State-Maryland football game, 
Wolfpack partisans started derisively chanting Golenbock's name and there was a 
banner denouncing him. There was also a banner referring to Poulton that read, 
"Goodbye Bruce, Can we have your seats?" 
</P>
<P>
Les Crenshaw, a 1971 graduate, was among the many outside Carter-Finley Stadium 
and he seemed a bit torn between liking Valvano and wanting a fresh start. Like 
many Wolfpack fans, he blames the News and Observer for blowing it out of 
proportion and reads Tar Heel blue between the lines, since several of the 
newspaper's staff went to archrival North Carolina. But there is a desire to 
fix the wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
"If Valvano knew about it and let it happen, then he ought to be punished," 
Crenshaw said. "The board of trustees will do that." 
</P>
<P>
Appropriate punishment? 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's already been punished," Crenshaw said. "We love him to death." 
</P>
<P>
That love stems in large part from the NCAA title Valvano brought home from 
Albuquerque in 1983. But the trophy -- and the school -- clearly has lost a bit 
of luster. 
</P>
<P>
"The faculty has felt that the image of the institution has been tarnished," 
said Long, who has heard faculty members say their complaints went unanswered. 
"Faculty concerns go back a number of years. Only more recently have those 
concerns been confirmed." 
</P>
<P>
In late August, C.D. Spangler, president of the University of North Carolina 
Board of Governors, which oversees the state university system, announced the 
findings of the Poole Commission, which was formed to investigate the program. 
The commission found academic abuses of the system and deficient academic 
performance by many basketball players, but Spangler reported no improper 
grade-changing. 
</P>
<P>
"The system has been misused. The spirit, not the letter, of the law has been 
broken," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler gave an example of one player, who received a non-passing grade in a 
class, but convinced the instructor that he would make up the missed exam and 
pass the class. So the instructor changed the grade to an incomplete. But the 
player then postponed the scheduled makeup once and ignored it the next time. 
The instructor changed the grade to no credit, but because the incomplete grade 
was on the record at the start of the semester, the player was eligible for the 
whole season. 
</P>
<P>
"The Poole Commision pointed out in clear terms ... what is probably the 
critical issue: it is the need of the basketball program to support more 
decisively the enforcement of academic rules," Spangler said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980 when Valvano arrived, 43 basketball players have been admitted to 
N.C. State. Nine are returning to the team this year. Of the remaining 34, 
eight earned degrees from N.C. State and three graduated from other schools. 
</P>
<P>
So there is an overall graduation rate of 32 percent, 24 percent from N.C. 
State itself. (The graduation rate for the rest of the student body is 22 
percent after four years, 52 percent after five years and 58 percent after six 
years.) Of the remaining 23 players who were on the team, three left in good 
standing, five were under some type of academic warning and 15 were suspended 
for academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the school released the NCAA's letter of official inquiry, which is 
essentially the list of charges. The NCAA said that players sold complimentary 
tickets for as much as $150 each, sold athletic shoes to local stores, received 
discounts from a local jewelry store and received food and lodging from 
athletic boosters. 
</P>
<P>
The school will have at least six weeks to respond and probably will go before 
the Committee on Infractions in November. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano, who declined to be interviewed for this article, said last week that 
he did not know players had sold tickets or shoes and indications are that he 
will remain as athletic director at least until the NCAA makes its judgment. 
</P>
<P>
That will be just a few days after the early signing period for the next batch 
of recruits. Four of the players he signed last year did not enroll and are 
headed for junior college. 
</P>
<P>
The number of this year's high-school seniors willing to sign up -- and what 
sort of academic credentials they bring with them -- might prove to be a sign 
of whether Valvano remains at N.C. State. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that overall we have an excellent athletic program, in which 
students are doing well scholastically as well as athletically," Long said, 
referring to teams like Dick Sheridan's football squad, which graduated 17 of 
19 seniors last spring. "It shows that it's already possible under the present 
set of conditions to excel academically and engage in intercollegiate 
athletics."

NFL CLUBS LEAN TOWARD DEFENSIVE SPECIALISTS AS HEAD COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GARBER, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only a decade ago, defensive coaches in the National Football League were a lot 
like Dan Quayle -- fine in their place but not generally considered chief 
executive officer material. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1979 we went to (Ray) Perkins as the head coach," New York Giants General 
Manager George Young said. "He was an offensive coordinator, one of the golden 
boys. (Bill) Walsh, (Joe) Gibbs and later (Dan) Reeves and (Mike) Ditka were 
the guys people were hiring. At the time, the defensive coaches in the league 
did not think they had a chance of becoming head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Boy Syndrome, as Young calls it, no longer prevails. Now, the 
league's owners are increasingly turning their teams over to defensive wizards. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's 28 head coaches are split; 14 are offensive specialists and 14 are 
defensive specialists. But of the six newcomers this season, five have a 
defensive resume. Three teams -- the Kansas City Chiefs, Detroit Lions and San 
Francisco 49ers -- made the switch from offense to defense. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are prevailing circumstances surrounding most new hires (for 
instance, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was the roommate of Coach Jimmy 
Johnson at the University of Arkansas), defense has become fashionable again in 
the fickle NFL. 
</P>
<P>
The laundry list: Johnson, Dallas; Marty Schottenheimer, Kansas City; Wayne 
Fontes, Detroit; George Seifert, San Francisco; Bud Carson, Cleveland Browns; 
Dan Henning, San Diego Chargers. Only Henning has extensive experience on 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"In the NFL, we copy success and believe in reincarnation," said Ernie Accorsi, 
Cleveland's executive vice president of football operations. "That's why so 
many of Vince Lombardi's assistants were hired over the years. That's why 
people are loading up on defense after the (Chicago) Bears and Giants won the 
Super Bowl. It's true with players and it's true with coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Accorsi says he interviewed seven defensive coordinators after Schottenheimer 
was fired over philosophical differences with owner Art Modell. With a 
successful quarterback, offensive coordinator and receivers coach already on 
board, Accorsi wanted to maintain offensive continuity. 
</P>
<P>
Most team executives interviewed for this story said that offensive or 
defensive expertise meant less than the character of the individual coach. 
However, most agreed that the bias toward offense that existed early in the 
1980s has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling has never changed," Young said. "You have to run and play defense. 
Sure, there's a trend there, but it comes down to the individual. There were 
some non-football people at the beginning of the decade who thought getting an 
offensive coordinator, a fancy passing game, would solve everything. 
</P>
<P>
"The myth has been exploded. (Don) Shula, (Tom) Landry, (Chuck) Noll, (Weeb) 
Ewbank ... they all came from defense, but people forgot about it because that 
was a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to open up the game, the NFL liberalized pass-blocking rules in 
1977 and 1978. The immediate result was more points. The long-term effect was a 
new premium on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Overmatched by offenses, defenses were forced to respond. As teams began to 
become more aggressive through blitzing in 1983, defensive touchdowns increased 
sharply as offensive touchdowns began to decline. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, 1983 was the year two defensive coordinators were elevated to 
head coaching jobs by their teams, Bill Parcells with the Giants and Marion 
Campbell with the Philadelphia Eagles. Just after the announcements had been 
made following the 1982 season, the two men met at the Senior Bowl in Mobile, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pressure on us," Campbell told Parcells. "A lot of defensive 
guys are looking to us. If we fail, they'll never get hired." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Carsons and Seiferts of the world, Parcells and Campbell 
made generally favorable impressions. At the same time, some of the league's 
defenses began to emerge as dominant. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a finesse label traceable to Walsh and quarterback Joe Montana, the San 
Francisco team that capped the 1984 season by winning Super Bowl XIX had a 
ruthless defense directed by Seifert. The Chicago Bears of 1985 allowed three 
playoff opponents a ridiculous total of 10 points on the way to victory in 
Super Bowl XX. The Giants' savage defense was a chief factor in a 17-2 season, 
including a victory in Super Bowl XXI. 
</P>
<P>
And so, owners were not afraid to give defensive coaches a chance. Chicago 
defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan accepted the Eagles' head coaching job Jan. 
29, 1986, three days after his defense shredded the New England Patriots in the 
ultimate game. He has prospered in Philadelphia and last season gave the Eagles 
their first division title in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Following that 1986 season, the Houston Oilers promoted defensive coordinator 
Jerry Glanville and the New Orleans Saints hired Jim Mora, a successful U.S. 
Football League coach who once served as the Patriots' defensive coordinator. 
Gene Stallings, Landry's defensive backs coach for 14 seasons in Dallas, was 
the choice of the St. Louis Cardinals. Glanville and Mora, who have led their 
teams to the playoffs, are considered saviors in their respective areas. 
</P>
<P>
This past off-season brought more turnover than usual at the top of NFL teams. 
Walsh and Landry retired, and Schottenheimer, Kansas City's Frank Gansz, 
Detroit's Darryl Rogers and San Diego's Al Saunders were all fired. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hire Marty just because he was a defensive coach," said Carl 
Peterson, Kansas City's general manager and chief operating officer. "But you 
win with defense. It's logic. If you can build a good defense, you always have 
a chance to win. I've always believed that. That's why I hired Jim Mora for the 
(Philadelphia) Stars (of the USFL)." 
</P>
<P>
Carson, the creative defensive coordinator of the New York Jets, was the first 
choice of the Browns. Accorsi was impressed with Carson's knowledge of offense. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been defensing offenses for years," Accorsi said. "He knows which 
offensive schemes give him the most trouble and how to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea that an offensive guy is that different from a defensive guy is 
the most overblown, ridiculous theory. People think they're different sports. 
Look at Shula and Landry ... they were defensive guys and they were still 
calling the plays on the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
Carson devotes 100 percent of his time to defense, something evident in 
Cleveland's 51-0 bombing of the Pittsburgh Steelers in last week's opener. He 
is content to let Marc Trestman, who tutored starter Bernie Kosar as well as 
Jim Kelly and Vinny Testaverde at the University of Miami, run the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Fontes was the defensive coordinator under John McKay at Tampa Bay, but when he 
was passed over in favor of Leeman Bennett on McKay's retirement, he joined the 
Lions in 1985. When Rogers was fired with five games left last season, Fontes 
was named interim coach. He was retained by owner William Clay Ford because he 
won as many games as Rogers (two) in six fewer tries. 
</P>
<P>
One of Fontes' first acts was hiring Mouse Davis, creator of the run-and-shoot 
offense, as his offensive coordinator. Although it is too early to call, 
Detroit is more likely to win games with its young defense this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Fontes might never have gotten the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Saying that defensive guys can't be head coaches is like saying men make 
better engineers than women," Young said. "It's only because you see more men 
as engineers. Now that more women are in the field that mold has been broken. 
That's what's happening with defensive coaches in the NFL."

BUD CARSON MAKES BELIEVERS OF BROWNS' FANS WITH IMPRESSIVE DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, Newsday 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If Bud Carson ever wrote down his philosophy of life, it probably would come 
out sounding something like Murphy's Law: If something can go wrong, it will, 
and it will go wrong at the worst possible moment. So, as he was standing on 
the sidelines during his NFL head-coaching debut Sunday at Pittsburgh's Three 
Rivers Stadium watching his Browns beat the Steelers worse than anyone ever had 
in the 57 years of their existence, Carson could not believe his eyes -- could 
not believe something so good could happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the Browns' shocking 51-0 victory, Carson Tuesday said, "It was a 
feeling of disbelief, and I was afraid it would all fall apart. We had a lot of 
fantastic luck. It was the type of thing that happens once in a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
The folks in Cleveland were no less astonished than Carson. Browns fans have 
not been quick to embrace the 58-year-old former New York Jets defensive 
coordinator who was largely unknown to them when owner Art Modell brought him 
in to replace Marty Schottenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
Schottenheimer led the Browns to four straight playoff appearances, but he 
refused to give in to Modell's desire to take a more innovative approach on 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Carson caused a public furor with his aborted plan to move 
popular Pro Bowl cornerback Hanford Dixon to safety. A 1-4 -preseason record 
only heightened the skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
But the eye-opener in Pittsburgh ought to convince a few people that Carson 
knows what he's doing. He promised an attack defense, and the Browns forced 
eight turnovers, scored three defensive touchdowns and recorded seven sacks. 
The headline in the Cleveland Plain-Dealer's sports section on Monday, in type 
the size of the letter at the top of an eye chart, read simply: "51-0!" 
</P>
<P>
Knowing Carson's penchant for finding the black lining in a silver cloud, the 
Plain-Dealer's Tony Grossi wrote: "Bud Carson, that great worrywart, must be 
wondering if it's all downhill from here." 
</P>
<P>
It would be next to impossible to play better. The Steelers were held to a 
record-low 53 yards and five first downs. "It was quite evident that was not a 
normal football game," Carson said afterward. "In all categories, we played 
almost a perfect game. I've never seen a defense create as many turnovers. It 
was one of the greatest games a defense can play in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that bothered Carson about winning that way was the effect it 
had on Steelers Coach Chuck Noll, who gave Carson his start in the NFL in 1972. 
It was Carson who put together the "Steel Curtain" defense for the first two of 
Noll's four Super Bowl champions. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck is a good friend," Carson said. "A 7-6 win might've been better." The 
touching thing was that he meant it. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's emotions, which he always wears on his sleeve on game day, should be 
running just as high Sunday at Cleveland Stadium for the Browns' home opener 
against the Jets (0-1). Not that he has anything against the Jets. In fact, 
Carson has always been grateful to Coach Joe Walton for resurrecting his career 
by hiring him in 1985 after a year out of football. But it's a matter of pride. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be another (emotional game)," Carson said. "But they all count one, no 
matter who they are. You can't afford to make any game too big for your 
football squad." 
</P>
<P>
The battle of wits between Carson, who calls all the defensive signals, and 
Walton will be an intriguing one. All of the Jets' offensive weapons will not 
be at Walton's disposal because of injuries to wide receivers Al Toon and 
Wesley Walker, so, Carson goes in with a clear advantage.

<P>
No one is better at putting together a defensive game plan than Carson, which 
explains the difference between the Browns' indifferent preseason performance 
and their remarkable display against the Steelers, who had injury problems on 
the offensive line that Carson exploited. 
</P>
<P>
"We had not played well in the preseason, and I was concerned," Carson 
admitted. "Of course, we really hadn't game-planned because we were trying to 
find out who the football players were." 
</P>
<P>
During the week before the opener, Carson finally resolved the uproar over 
Dixon's status by returning him to cornerback. The 30-year-old seemed to have 
lost a step in the past year, which was one reason Carson moved him to free 
safety. Early in training camp, Carson, who is known for his honesty, said 
Dixon was "showing slippage." That remark, for which Carson apologized, caused 
most of the trouble. In fact, Carson says it actually was Dixon's idea to move 
to safety. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to be a safety; I think he talked to (49ers safety) Ronnie Lott at 
the Pro Bowl," Carson said. "I was trying to let him do that. I moved him back 
to cornerback because he looked completely different than when I first watched 
him. He just was a very slow starter. He can still run, or, I wouldn't have put 
him back. There's no question in my mind that I made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
As harsh as Carson can be at times with his blunt criticism, his players know 
and appreciate the fact that he accepts his share of the blame when things go 
wrong. When someone asked him Sunday if Dixon's return to cornerback were 
permanent, Carson replied, "Hanford is the cornerback until I screw it up again 
and move him back." 
</P>
<P>
If Carson's honesty has offended some people or gotten him into trouble along 
the way, it also is the quality that caused so many associates to speak up for 
him last January when they heard that he had a shot at the Browns' job. Former 
Steelers greats Mel Blount, Jack Ham and Andy Russell made unsolicited calls to 
Modell to put in a good word. So did Steelers owner Dan Rooney, former Rams 
general manager Don Klosterman and Jets owner Leon Hess. 
</P>
<P>
"Leon Hess called and talked about Bud Carson the man," Modell recalled. "He 
said, 'You will not find a finer man."' 
</P>
<P>
Modell hired Carson with the expectation that he could get the Browns to the 
Super Bowl, but in a way, the pressure is no more than Carson put on himself in 
all the years he spent grinding to get a head job. His days of wondering and 
wandering to seven NFL teams are over. Cleveland is the final stop. "This is 
it," Carson said. "I'm not going anyplace else to coach football. I promised 
that to my wife, Linda. She's sick of moving, and I am, too."

Northwestern put a halt to quarterback Dee Dowis' run on statistics, but Air 
Force had too many other guns Saturday night and the undefeated Falcons rolled 
to a 48-31 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dowis, who had rushed for 450 yards in two previous victories, was limited to 
40 yards rushing and hit five of nine passes for 89 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But one of his passes was a 44-yard touchdown to Trent Van Hulzen and he also 
scored on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a job to do and tonight they let us pitch the ball," Dowis said. "They 
stopped our outside game but our running backs did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Johnson scored three touchdowns on runs of one, 32 and 18 yards on pitches 
from Dowis. Chris Howard added a 14-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
It was 14-14 at the half, so Air Force (3-0) came out with fullback Rodney 
Lewis running on first option traps in the third quarter when he gained 86 of 
his 98 yards rushing to set up two of Johnson's touchdowns and field goals of 
40 and 41 yards by Joe Wood. 
</P>
<P>
"We came in at halftime and got it all down," Dowis said. "They made us pitch 
but that's the good thing about this (option) offense. You shut down one part, 
then you have to worry about two others." 
</P>
<P>
For Northwestern (0-2), Bob Christian rushed for 98 yards and scored on runs of 
17 and three yards and quarterback Tim O'Brien completed 24 of 32 passes for 
297 yards, including a five-yard touchdown pass to Richard Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force had a 24-17 lead late in the third quarter when O'Brien completed a 
37-yard pass to Buchanan to put the Wildcats deep in Falcon territory. Two 
plays later at the 32-yard line, Christian had two chances to gain a yard for a 
first down but was stopped.

MARSALIS REACHES BACK WITH 'MAJESTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WYNTON MARSALIS: "The Majesty of the Blues." Columbia CK45091. ** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
The opening title tune and the second cut, "Hickory Dickory Dock," are played 
by the regular Marsalis sextet, with the leader reaching even further back than 
has been his wont. There are suggestions of early Ellington, along with touches 
of inspired Marcus Roberts piano. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of the album, 35 minutes, is devoted to a three-part work, "The New 
Orleans Function," for which a more traditional instrumentation and sound are 
employed to recapture the spirit of the funeral: Danny Barker, the 80-year-old 
New Orleans guitar player, here switching to banjo, and Dr. Michael White in 
some antic clarinet effects. 
</P>
<P>
The dirge in the first movement and the exhilaration of the third are 
convincingly carried out, but the whole effect is vitiated by the middle 
section, a 16-minute Philipic written by Marsalis' Boswell, Stanley Crouch, and 
protesting too much and too long and repetitiously that the noble art of jazz 
has been ruined by commercialization. 
</P>
<P>
There are unpleasant overtones here: Significantly, the text in the booklet 
reads at one point: "The moneylenders of the marketplace have Never Ever known 
the difference between an office of an auction block and a temple." But on the 
record the words "and a temple" had been mysteriously excised. Did someone at 
CBS decide that this was carrying the offensiveness a little too far? 
</P>
<P>
SMITHSONIAN: "Jazz Piano." RD039 (Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. 
20560). 
</P>
<P>
***** 
</P>
<P>
The evolution and glorious diversification of jazz piano throughout this 
century is admirably represented in another classic Smithsonian collection. The 
time span runs from Jelly Roll Morton in 1924 to a Tommy Flanagan/Hank Jones 
duet in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Williams, the one-man committee who made these selections, was careful 
in his choices, as well as in his priorities: Art Tatum is accorded five tracks 
(including, of course, "Get Happy" and "Sweet Lorraine"); Bud Powell and Earl 
Hines have four each; Fats Waller, Teddy Wilson, Erroll Garner, Thelonious Monk 
and Bill Evans have three apiece, and several others, among them Nat King Cole 
and Duke Ellington, are represented twice. Duke's "The Clothed Women" is an 
amazingly avant-garde rarity. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' Achilles' heel is his indifference to Oscar Peterson, who is omitted 
entirely except for a two-minute snippet from a Fred Astaire record. But the 
inclusions are generally wise, taking in such underrated talents as Avery 
Parrish (in his legendary blues "After Hours"), Jimmy Rowles (his own tune "The 
Peacocks"), Dodo Marmarosa and Randy Weston. 
</P>
<P>
Available in a four-CD set, "Jazz Piano" includes a 72-page booklet with 
scholarly notes by Williams, critic Francis Davis and the pianist Dick Katz. 
</P>
<P>
Biographies and a bibliography complete this invaluable set. 
</P>
<P>
CAROL SLOANE: "Love You Madly." Contemporary CCD14049-2. **** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
This is at once a superior vocal album and a first-rate jazz instrumental set. 
Sloane is backed by guitarist Kenny Burrell on two tunes, and on "Norwegian 
Wood" by Richard Rodney Bennett, who also wrote the simple, functional 
arrangements for the group cuts with Art Farmer, Clifford Jordan and Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
Sloane understands every melody, knows just how many liberties to take and 
phrasing and alteration; she senses the inner feeling of each lyric. In short, 
she is a consummate jazz singer to whom the likes of Diane Schuur and Betty 
Carter could advantageously devote some serious listen-and-learn time. The 
choice of tunes, too, is first-rate: Wilder's "While We're Young," Armstrong's 
"Someday You'll Be Sorry," Blossom Dearie's "Inside A Silent Tear." 
</P>
<P>
STEPHANIE NAKASIAN: "Comin' Alive." V.S.O.P 73CD (11 Lochness Court, Rockville, 
Md 20850). 
</P>
<P>
**** 
</P>
<P>
"Inside A Silent Tear" reappears here, in a no less appealing version by 
another splendid, almost unknown jazz singer, who toured a few years ago with 
Jon Hendricks. Her two-part counterpart with pianist Hod O'Brien, the solos by 
Phil Woods on alto, Warren Chiasson on vibes and Wayne Andre playing some 
gutbucket trombone all contribute to another vital, life-affirming collection, 
with several little-known songs such as the Marvin Fisher-Jack Segal "May I 
Come In." 
</P>
<P>
JUDY CARMICHAEL:"Trio." C&amp;D Productions (unnumbered; 21 East 4th St., New 
York, N.Y. 10003). 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Well established as one of the younger and most dedicated pianists in the 
stride tradition, Carmichael here keeps what might seem like strange company: 
No bass, no drums, just Michael Hashim on alto and soprano saxophones and Chris 
Flory on guitar. Because of her strong, self-sufficient left hand and the 
sympathetic participation of her colleagues, it works out surprisingly well. 
</P>
<P>
Carmichael tends to choose compositions by other pianists: Ellington, Basie, 
Fats Waller and James P. Johnson are all represented, but so are Django 
Reinhardt (an attractive reading of his early "Swing '42"), and Harry (Sweets) 
Edison ("Jive At Five"). Flory's fluency and Hashim's consistent sense of swing 
are helpful, but in the final analysis the main credit goes to Carmichael for a 
performance rich in confidence and energy. 
</P>
<P>
HOWARD RUMSEY'S LIGHTHOUSE ALL STARS:"Jazz Invention." Contemporary 
CCD14051-2.*** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Although Rumsey, now retired, gave up the bass long ago (Monty Budwig takes his 
place here), he is the guiding light behind this reunion of men who worked for 
him at the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach during the 1950s and '60s. The session 
was taped live at the nearby Civic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Cooper is the main figure, as composer of the title track, tenor 
saxophonist, arranger and musical director. Surrounded by old friends (Bud 
Shank, Conte Candoli, Bob Enevoldsen, Claude Williamson, John Guerin), he has 
created a nostalgically agreeable revival of what were, to many Southern 
Californians, the golden years. The tunes are mainly standards ("Topsy," 
"Billie's Bounce," "Lover Man," "Broadway"). The amusing and affectionate liner 
notes are by Sleepy Steim, who in those days was the popular KNOB disc jockey.

RECORD RACK:: AEROSMITH "PUMP." GEFFEN ** 1/2:*****GREAT BALLS OF FIRE:****

Back in the '70s, everybody assumed Aerosmith was ripping off the Stones ... 
and they were. Since the early '80s, everybody's been ripping off Aerosmith 
instead, which is different. Back then Aerosmith was sort of generically bluesy 
like every other hard-rock band (though each song had at least one awesome 
hook), and rock 'n' roll intellectuals particularly hated Aerosmith because 
they wrote tight, commercial radio songs in an era when pop was a dirty word. 
Also, their smirky lyrics were dumb beyond belief. Eighties hard rock is, of 
course, an Aerosmithian tincture of swagger, smut and pouty pop craft. 
</P>
<P>
In '87, Aerosmith listened to all the baby Aerosmiths the way the Kinks had 
listened to Van Halen's cranked version of "You've Really Got Me" 10 years 
before, and came out with the monster album "Permanent Vacation," which for a 
while out-Aerosmithed them all. The problem is, Guns N' Roses, Motley Crue, 
Raging Slab -- even Poison -- make better Aerosmith albums these days. And now, 
in this era of total Aerosmithification, comes the oddly non-Aerosmithy "Pump." 
</P>
<P>
There are spooky, Peter Gabriel-ish intros on instruments like dulcimers and 
didjeridus, and riffs that are copped from AC/DC and the Zep. One song, "The 
Other Side," sounds like minor Rod Stewart, complete with horns and raspy 
moans, and another, "Janie's Got a Gun," has a groove you'd expect to hear from 
the Police but not from Aerosmith. 
</P>
<P>
The hooks are of the lightweight, catchy variety, ones you can almost imagine 
Martika or someone using -- not like, say, the forged-iron swoop in "Rats in 
the Cellar." And the songs are stripped down to the point where they seem 
almost pop sketches (they'll probably sound terrific filled-out live). 
</P>
<P>
Still, of all the Aerosmithsonians, Aerosmith remains closest to the blues, the 
sexy, insinuating soul of hard rock, and Steven Tyler sings even the lamest 
double-entendres ("Stuck in an elevator / Livin' it up while I'm goin' down") 
with passion. JONATHAN GOLD

If you were looking for more great dance music from Jackson -- a "Control II" 
perhaps -- you may be disappointed by this transition album. While clinging to 
her dance-music roots, Jackson has decided to branch out in other directions. 
</P>
<P>
With 1986's "Control," a commercial blockbuster, she established herself as 
queen of the young dance-music divas, paving the way for the likes of Pebbles, 
Paula Abdul and Samantha Fox. But she is now stepping beyond that bunch. Her 
goal apparently is to be another Madonna -- the kind of dance-music queen who 
can also sing ballads and pop tunes. 
</P>
<P>
The album, which she largely co-wrote, runs the gamut -- from social commentary 
to lusty, sensual tunes, from dance music to songs laced with jazz and 
Brazilian textures. Vocally, Jackson exposes herself more -- not hiding behind 
technological wizardry as much as she did on "Control." Her voice, however, 
remains somewhat thin and wispy. For what she's trying to do, she needs more 
vocal power. 
</P>
<P>
What's lost, for the dance fans, is crispness and punch. The dance tracks on 
the new album are generally busier and more subdued than they should be. What 
she hopes to gain is artistic credibility. Working again with 
producing/composing team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Jackson has made an 
intriguing album. It's certainly more complex, challenging and thoughtful than 
"Control." 
</P>
<P>
The move to social commentary, however, is a rocky one. "State of the World" 
and "Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)" aren't interesting enough musically 
to carry the messages, though the dance rhythms better support the lyrics on 
the title song and "The Knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
The highlights are the bouncy "Escapade" and "Someday Is Tonight," a long, 
steamy tale of romantic surrender, backed by a memorable, muted Herb Alpert 
trumpet solo that recalls Miles Davis' sultry '50s sound. More than any other 
number on this ambitious, if uneven album, "Someday Is Tonight" is a signal 
that the woman who once seemed doomed to always be known as Michael's little 
sister has grown up. DENNIS HUNT

The aerospace boom is over. Michael Milken is having a bad year. Movies aren't 
better than ever. But L.A.'s hottest growth industry -- bad heavy metal -- 
continues apace, and the four members of Motley Crue, who bear the approximate 
relationship to lightweight metal that Henry Ford did to cars, have survived 
lawsuits, gnarly car wrecks and a near-fatal OD of their bass player to put out 
their strongest album since "Shout at the Devil" half a dozen years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, things have changed. People used to accuse the band of incompetent 
musicianship. Today, compared to, say, Faster Pussycat, they sound tight as 
Toto. When they emerged on the local club scene in the new wave summer of '81, 
lipstick and codpieces were something of a novelty. They might have been one of 
the first bands with umlauts, too. Their lyrics, while still raunchy enough, 
seem like Judy Collins or something next to Slayer's or even Guns N' Roses' 
now, and their party-hearty attitude has abated a bit since all four Cruuesters 
kicked drugs and alcohol earlier this year. They even played at the peace 'n' 
understanding fest in Moscow a couple of weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But of all the L.A. glam-metal bands of the '80s, Motley Crue has always 
understood both the Bay City Rollers kind of teen-dream appeal -- they even 
sound like the Rollers on a couple of tunes on this album -- and the importance 
of the riff: the pounding, shrieking, two-chord monoliths that have always 
powered the best hard rock. (Their guitar solos have always been kind of lame.) 
"Dr. Feelgood" has awesome riffs, the sort that half the 14-year-old boys in 
America will try to pick out on their brand-new Sears guitars. Therefore, it 
rocks -- hard. Jonathon Gold

POP FACES: FROM AN ODD COUPLE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mavis Staples, famous as part of the gospel-cum-secular soul group the Staple 
Singers, had met and sung with Prince on a number of occasions. But she was 
wholly unprepared last year when her father, Pops Staples, called and told her 
that the Purple Batguy's manager was trying to track her down to offer her a 
solo contract with his Paisley Park Records. 
</P>
<P>
"When they said that Prince wanted to write for me and have me join his label, 
I was flattered, but I did ask the manager, 'Now, what type of song would 
Prince be writing for me?' It wasn't because of any dirty lyrics or anything, 
it was because of what I had heard Vanity and Apollonia singing. Those to me 
were teeny-bopper songs. I said, 'I'm a grown woman, what would he write for 
me?' " 
</P>
<P>
She was duly assured that The Kid (a Prince alias) would write some tunes 
suitable for a woman of experience and substance, and that was that. "I was 
real cool on the telephone, but I got off the phone and I jumped up and down 
and ran around, I felt so happy," said a laughing, effusive Staples. "It's been 
joy and I've been grinnin' ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Prince produced the new album, "Time Waits for No One" (Mavis' first solo 
effort since 1976), in Minneapolis in association with Stax veterans Al Bell, 
Homer Banks and Lester Snell in Tennessee. "It gave us a funky 
Memphis-and-Minnesota sound, so I started calling it MAM," said Staples, a 
Chicago resident. 
</P>
<P>
The odd coupling of Mavis and Prince did shock some who recall the Staple 
Singers' roots as a gospel group, she acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"People have asked me, 'How do you feel about him putting God's name with sex?' 
But I think 'Love-sexy' is one of the most beautiful albums that Prince has 
written. He sent it to me, and I sat down and read the lyrics. It's true that 
he has the Lord's name in there with sex, but when the deal goes down, when 
it's all said and done, it's all beauty. This is the way I analyze it." CHRIS 
WILLMAN

POP FACES: BICULTURAL MUSIC

<TEXT>
<P>
For most of her 33 years, Tish Hinojosa felt caught between two worlds. Her 
parents, who immigrated from Mexico to San Antonio some 50 years ago, worked 
hard to hold on to their heritage. But her 12 older siblings discarded much of 
their roots. 
</P>
<P>
It was the same in her musical career. Hinojosa, influenced by Emmylou Harris 
and Linda Ronstadt, often found herself having to choose between her interests 
in Southwestern Latino traditions and the commercial realities of the 
country-folk field in which she worked. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important to go with the norm of society," she said from her home 
in Austin, Tex. "But it's a real loss if you lose your culture and heritage." 
</P>
<P>
But in the last couple years, Hinojosa came to appreciate that the bicultural 
immigrant experience is the norm of American society. That fact, and pride in 
her two cultures, inspired the thematic core of "Homeland," Hinojosa's first 
major-label album, on A&amp;M's new Americana series. The songs (three of them 
in Spanish) speak of struggles and triumphs on both sides of the Mexico-Texas 
border, and draw on the rich musical traditions of the region. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, Hinojosa hardly dreamed of being able to release this 
kind of material through a major label. At the time, she was living in 
Nashville, contracted by Mel Tillis' publishing company to sing songs from its 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
"But the music I was starting to write in '83 and '84 was taking a turn toward 
social issues and I was writing more Spanish stuff," she said. "That wasn't 
selling at all in Nashville. They said, 'Nah, it's not commercial.' But instead 
of taking it personally, I figured it was time to leave."

ART NEWS: A RARE LOOK AT WOLFLI'S 'OUTSIDER ART' EXHIBITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Known as the first and foremost practitioner of "outsider art," Adolf Wolfli 
spent his entire artistic life confined in a Swiss mental institution. Yet in 
the space of 30 years (from 1899-1929), he created a body of art encompassing 
3,000 drawings and 25,000 pages of text, images and musical notations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of unbelievable, because he came from such a deprived, depressed 
background with no formal education at all," said Phyllis Plous, curator of the 
UC Santa Barbara Art Museum, where a rare exhibition of Wolfli's work opens 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The traveling exhibition, "The Other Side of the Moon: The World of Adolf 
Wolfli," consists of 85 pencil and colored pencil drawings and collages of 
landscapes, cosmic battles, and imaginary travels around the world. Also 
included is a taped interpretation of some of Wolfli's musical notations. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who know anything about it know how rare it is to have a chance to see 
it without going to Switzerland," said Plous of Wolfli's work, which has been 
shown in the United States only once before (in a traveling exhibition in 
1978-79). Plous added that because the drawings are done on fragile newsprint, 
this may be the last time the works leave Switzerland. (Their permanent home is 
at the Adolf Wolfli Foundation in Berne.) 
</P>
<P>
"They're pretty fragile for much more travel -- this tour is probably it," 
Plous said. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition's showing at UC Santa Barbara completes a five-stop U.S. and 
Canadian tour. 
</P>
<P>
GRANTS: The California Arts Council has awarded a total of $1.9 million to 194 
organizations and schools as part of its Artists in Residency Program. The 
program is designed to bring artists and the public together in either school 
and community settings and social institutions. The awards were made in several 
areas of the arts, including music, dance, literature, media arts, theater, 
visual arts, folk arts, and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. County groups receiving grants -- ranging from $3,600 to $10,400 -- 
for resident artists in the visual arts are the Long Beach Museum of Art, 
Korean Youth Center of Los Angeles, Los Angeles' Self-Help Graphics &amp; Arts, 
Santa Monica's Olympic High School, Los Angeles' Fairburn Avenue Elementary 
School, Santa Monica Alternative School House, Pasadena's Sequoia School, Los 
Angeles' Hilltop Nursery School, and the Boys/Girls Club of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
AUCTION: Focus On AIDS II, a photography auction and benefit for AIDS Project 
Los Angeles and the City of Angels Hospice, will be held Monday at 7 p.m. at 
the Palace, 1735 N. Vine St., Hollywood. Items to be auctioned include rare 
vintage and contemporary photographs by Rebecca Blake, Greg Gorman, Robert 
Mapplethorpe, Annie Leibovitz, Helmut Newton and Herb Ritts. 
</P>
<P>
The event is the second such benefit put on by Focus On AIDS, a volunteer group 
committed to raising funds and awareness to fight Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome and care for those suffering from the disease. Tickets are $50 dollars 
each and can be obtained by a phone call to (213) 652-5204. 
</P>
<P>
OPENING: In his "A Conversation on Collecting," noted art collector Richard A. 
Manoogian says his collection "is probably broader and much larger than most 
American private collections. I don't know if that's good or bad or just an 
obsession." Whichever may be the case, Californians can see a portion of his 
collection -- 63 19th-Century paintings, including Hudson River and 
Impressionist landscapes, trompe l'oeil still lifes, genre scenes, and figure 
paintings -- at San Francisco's M. H. de Young Memorial Museum's "American 
Paintings From the Manoogian Collection," which opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Detroit Institute of the Arts and the National Gallery of Art, 
the traveling exhibition features works from every major school and tradition 
in American 19th-Century painting. It includes paintings by Thomas Cole, John 
Singer Sargent, George Caleb Bingham, Raphaelle Peale, Mary Cassatt, Thomas 
Eakins, Jasper Cropsey, Sanford Gifford, Thomas Worthington Whittredge, Albert 
Bierstadt, William Harnett, William Merritt Chase, Maurice Prendergast and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
CONTEST: Black Gallery is holding its fourth annual photography contest, with 
$1,500 in cash and prizes being awarded in four categories. The contest is open 
to both professional and amateur photographers, who may submit black-and-white 
or color prints in the categories of photojournalism, landscapes, conceptual 
photographs and portraiture. The entry deadline is Oct. 28. For more 
information and entry rules, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to Photo 
Contest '89, Black Gallery, 107 Santa Barbara Plaza, Los Angeles, Calif. 90008; 
or call (213) 294-9024.

NOTEBOOK: A BIT OF CHINESE CUISINE TO A LATIN BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Mario Tamayo (co-founder of Cha Cha Cha and proprietor of Cafe Mambo) is 
readying the Atlas Bar &amp; Grill in the Wilshire District's Wiltern building, 
his estranged partner, Toribio Prado, has a project in the works, too: a 
Chinese/Latino hybrid sort of place in Hollywood, to be called Chino Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Prado currently runs Cha Cha Cha and serves as consulting chef at the popular 
new El Mocambo, an upscale Cuban-style establishment in West Hollywood. El 
Mocambo boss Perry Santos is his partner in the new enterprise, which is 
scheduled to open in late November on the site of the landmark Chinese Kitchen, 
across the street from El Coyote on Beverly Boulevard. Santos and his wife 
Marta are designing the interior of Chino Latino, which they promise "will 
resemble a Chinese restaurant in the middle of the Amazon." The menu will mix 
Cuban and Central and South American food ideas with dishes from several 
regions of China -- for instance, "mu shu burrito" stuffed with fried plantains 
and black beans, and Chinese-style barbecued pork ribs with mango and tomatillo 
salsa. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really having fun with the whole idea," says Santos. "We've been playing 
with a wok stove on our off hours at El Mocambo. We've been in New York, 
checking out the Chinese-Cuban scene there, meeting chefs, and so on. Now 
Toribio is taking a couple of Chinese cooking classes, and he's actually going 
to go cook at a Chinese restaurant downtown for a while. We've got all kinds of 
ideas. The guest checks are going to be written on Chinese laundry tickets. 
We're having special Spanish-language fortune cookies made up. And we're going 
to have the most interesting eggrolls and sparerib sauces you've ever tasted" 
</P>
<P>
Santos adds two other bits of news: He and Prado are also developing a take-out 
barbecue concept, in association with entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. And, he says, 
"We're negotiating right now to open El Mocambo in the Trump Plaza in New York 
. . . right where Trader Vic's used to be." 
</P>
<P>
RUMOR CONTROL: A reader spotted a notice of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing for 
the Gustaf Anders partnership and related businesses that ran the first-rate 
California/contemporary restaurant in La Jolla until earlier this year. 
However, owners, William (Gustaf) Magnuson and Ulf (Anders) Standberg recently 
moved the restaurant to the South Coast Plaza Village shopping center in Santa 
Ana where it is very much open and going strong. When contacted, Standberg said 
the bankruptcy was merely a way of clearing up a complicated situation left 
behind in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
BIGGER THAN THE BEATLES?: It's no secret that Michael McCarty, proprietor of 
Michael's in Santa Monica (and Adirondacks in Denver and Washington), has, 
shall we say, a well-developed sense of self-esteem. Just how well-developed, 
wasn't apparent until invitations for this year's "Eat for Art" event came out 
recently. It features a photograph of McCarty cast as, well, Jesus Christ. The 
photo is a take-off on Da Vinci's "The Last Supper" in which 11 Westside chefs 
-- among them Gerri Gilliland (Gilliland's), Evan Kleiman (the Angelis), Stan 
Pratt (West Beach Cafe), Steve Neveaux (Opera) and Norbert Knoll (Knoll's Black 
Forest Inn) -- strike adoring, apostolic poses. (Apparently, no one wanted to 
play Judas.) In the center, wearing a suit and a smirk, and making a gesture 
not unlike that made by the central figure in Da Vinci's original, is McCarty. 
Come to think of it, though, McCarty might not see himself as Christ, but as 
French super-chef Paul Bocuse, who once posed with his fellow chefs in a 
similar photographic recreation. Frankly, I'm not sure which is worse. 
</P>
<P>
(Eat for Art, incidentally, is a benefit for the Santa Monica Pier on Oct. 2. A 
dozen local restaurants provide food -- tickets are $100 per person. Proceeds 
go to the foundation's numerous civic arts programs. Call (213) 458-8350 for 
further information.) 
</P>
<P>
RESTAURANT MISCELLANY: Bruno's Ristorante, the big, antique- and 
artifact-filled Italian restaurant in Mar Vista, perhaps best known for its 
good and remarkably priced wine list, has closed -- "temporarily", say its 
proprietors. . . . The Pine Avenue Grill in Long Beach, owned and operated by 
the University Restaurant Group (which also runs Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa 
Monica), has transformed itself into the Pine Avenue Fish House. In honor of 
the change, the restaurant is offering each guest who samples the new dinner 
menu a coupon worth $6 towards breakfast at the place. . . . Loretta's Original 
Chinese Food on Burton Way in Beverly Hills has opened a second B.H. location 
nearby on La Cienega. 
</P>
<P>
EVENTS: A four-course wild boar dinner will be served at the Showley-Wrightson 
Restaurant in Newport Beach on Oct. 1. The wines of Guenoc will be featured, 
and the price is $65 per person, including tax and tip.

ANGELS WASTE THREE-HITTER BY MCCASKILL IN 2-1 DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels' wastage continued to expand Saturday night during another loss to 
the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park, this by an exasperating final margin of 
2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Wasted: Kirk McCaskill's three-hit complete game. 
</P>
<P>
Wasted: A chance to beat up on White Sox pitcher Shawn Hillegas, who was making 
his first start since May 26 because his earned-run average as a starter, 
before Saturday, was 14.90. 
</P>
<P>
Wasted: An opportunity to move within 2 1/2 games of American League West 
leader Oakland, a 5-2 loser to Boston earlier in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Waste being a terrible thing to mind, McCaskill didn't mind speaking his to 
reporters in the aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, I never thought two runs would beat us," McCaskill said. 
"Secondly, I don't know, it's easy to start throwing some stones, but we 
realistically could be 1 1/2 out. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, what we lack is a little mental discipline. We have these streaks. 
If we don't make it this year, that's what we're going to look back on and kick 
our butts about. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a great opportunity for us. If we can't get up for a game, knowing we 
can gain a game in the standings, we don't deserve anything." 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked McCaskill what he meant by "mental discipline." 
</P>
<P>
"We strike out too much," he said. "I'm not trying to blame the hitters for 
anything because there have been times when we haven't pitched well, and I'm 
including myself, but from a pitching standpoint, I look at our offense and see 
how great it could be." 
</P>
<P>
And then he looks at this three-game series against the last-place team in the 
AL West and sees the Angel offense scoring a grand total of four runs, striking 
out 31 times and getting three walks. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is when we lose, we strike out a lot and don't hit home runs," 
McCaskill said. " . . . I just look at what we have and what (the offense) 
could be. If we had a little more discipline at the plate, we'd have an awesome 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
But awesome isn't what Angel Manager Doug Rader is asking for. Adequate would 
suffice. 
</P>
<P>
For a study in something less than that, examine these last three games at 
Comiskey Park: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Game 1, Friday evening: Chicago's starting pitcher is Melido Perez. His 
pregame ERA is 5.19. His won-lost record is 9-13. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels manage two hits against him and strike out 12 times. They lose, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Game 2, Friday evening: Chicago's starting pitcher is Richard Dotson. His 
pregame ERA is 4.86. His won-lost record is 4-9. 
</P>
<P>
Against Dotson and two relief pitchers, Wayne Edwards and Terry Jones, the 
Angels manage eight hits, two runs and nine strikeouts. They win, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Game 3, Saturday evening: Chicago starts Hillegas, whose pregame totals are 
4.61 and 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
Against Hillegas and relievers Steve Rosenberg, Jose Segura and Bobby Thigpen, 
the Angels squeeze out one run and six hits while striking out 10 more times. 
</P>
<P>
Mental discipline, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
Even the Angel hitters had to concede McCaskill's point. 
</P>
<P>
"He's right," right fielder Claudell Washington said. "We've got some guys 
struggling, swinging at a lot of bad balls. A lot of untimely hitting." 
</P>
<P>
And from first baseman Wally Joyner: 
</P>
<P>
"I think he might be correct. We knew going in that Oakland lost and if we win 
our game, we've got a chance to gain some ground. Instead of going out there 
relaxed and making things happen, we were trying to force things to happen, and 
that's not how you're supposed to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's discipline, but the problem we have is that we're trying 
to do too much with the ball. Instead of hitting singles, everybody's trying to 
hit five-run home runs. You can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill (15-9) lost this game when he walked the first two batters he faced, 
saw each advance 90 feet on an infield out and then failed to knock down a 
bouncer up the middle by Steve Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
When Lyons' grounder hopped over second base for a single, both Lance Johnson 
and Scott Fletcher scored. By that much, McCaskill was headed for defeat. 
</P>
<P>
And left to blame himself for petty transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have had it," McCaskill said of Lyons' ball. "It just went over my 
glove." 
</P>
<P>
And the walks to Johnson and Fletcher? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't prepare myself, obviously," he said. "There's no excuse for going out 
there and not throwing strikes." 
</P>
<P>
But from that point on, McCaskill gave up only two more hits -- a fourth-inning 
double by Carlton Fisk and an eighth-inning bad-hop double by Ivan Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored their only run against Hillegas (7-10) in the fourth inning 
on a bad-hop single by Washington, a double by Devon White and an infield 
single by Chili Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty impressive stuff. 
</P>
<P>
There were only two more Angel scoring threats. In the second inning, Johnny 
Ray was on first base with two out when Jack Howell's sharp one-hopper struck 
first base umpire Jim Joyce in the wrist and rolled slightly past first base. 
Howell wound up with a single on the play, Ray stopped at third and Hillegas 
pitched out of the jam by retiring John Orton on a fly ball to right. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth inning, Jim Eppard was on first base with one out when Washington 
hit a slicing line-drive single to left-center. Eppard held up at second and 
was replaced by pinch-runner Mark McLemore, who advanced to third base on an 
infield out. But McLemore, too, was stranded when Davis flied to left against 
Thigpen. 
</P>
<P>
Four Angel runs in three games. 
</P>
<P>
Against three White Sox starting pitchers with a cumulative ERA hovering around 
5.00. 
</P>
<P>
"I know, I know, I know, I know," Rader said, shaking his head. "Don't rub it 
in." 
</P>
<P>
The manager wanted to say some more, but bit his tongue. 
</P>
<P>
It was the best display of mental discipline evidenced in an Angel uniform all 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
"When you lose a game when there are very few scoring opportunities," Angel 
Manager Doug Rader was saying, "you hash it over in your mind: What could have 
been done differently?" OK, let's go with that. For starters, could Jack 
Howell's second-inning line drive been enough to score Johnny Ray from first 
base had it not struck umpire Jim Joyce? "I don't know," Rader said. "With 
Johnny Ray on first, it's questionable." 
</P>
<P>
And in the eighth inning, with Jim Eppard moving from first to second on 
Claudell Washington's line-drive single to left-center field? Should Rader have 
pinch-run Mark McLemore earlier for Eppard, giving the Angels a better chance 
for a first-and-third opportunity after Washington's hit? "Yeah, I thought 
about it," Rader said. "But I was thinking of saving McLemore for the ninth 
inning, in case Wally (Joyner) or (Brian) Downing get on and we need a real 
base stealer. But I don't know if Mac could've gotten to third on Claudell's 
hit. He'd have had to freeze on the ball, because it looked like it was going 
to be caught. That's what Epp did." 
</P>
<P>
Devon White's third-inning double was less than a foot shy of clearing the 
fences, a few inches that ultimately proved costly for the Angels. The Angels 
scored their only run of the game in that inning, but White was left at third 
base when Joyner grounded into an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Friday's doubleheader and a lack of days off next week, Rader has 
decided to start Chuck Finley on three days' rest Tuesday night in Minnesota. 
Not wanting to play Dial-A-Spot-Starter again, Rader opted for Finley, who 
started Friday's second game, but went only five innings. Finley made of total 
of 67 pitches.

Scott Schaffner passed for a career-high 220 yards and two touchdowns and 
Darrell Thompson ran for two more scores in leading Minnesota to a 30-20 
victory over Iowa State Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Schaffner threw touchdown passes of 10 yards to Pat Tingelhoff in the first 
quarter and 54 yards to Paul Hopewell in the third period as Minnesota won its 
opener for the 13th time in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore completed 12 of 18 passes in topping his previous best of 201 
yards against Indiana last year. He left the game early in the fourth quarter 
with an ankle injury and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, Minnesota's career rushing leader, topped the 100-yard mark for the 
16th time in a regular season game after gaining only 32 yards on 16 first-half 
carries. He finished with 106 yards in 32 attempts, including scoring runs of 
one yard in the second quarter and two yards early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Schaffner's touchdown pass to Hopewell on a fly pattern gave Minnesota a 24-10 
lead with 10:44 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State (1-1) pulled to within 24-17 with an 82-yard, 14-play drive that 
Blaise Bryant capped with a six-yard touchdown run on the second play of the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Minnesota flanker Kevin Grant sped 23 yards on a reverse two plays after 
the kickoff, and the Gophers were off on 12-play, 80-yard march that Thompson 
capped with his two-yard touchdown run with 10:41 left, making it 30-17. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Shudak's 39-yard field goal cut the lead to 30-20 with 6:34 to go and the 
Cyclones recovered his ensuing onside kick. But quarterback Bret Oberg fumbled 
five plays later and Minnesota's Eddie Miles recovered at his own 30.

Tailback Eric Bieniemy rushed for two touchdowns and passed for another to lead 
No. 8 Colorado over No. 10 Illinois, 38-7, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes (3-0) sacked Illinois quarterback Jeff George four times for 54 
yards in losses, intercepted two of his passes, limited him to 99 yards passing 
and, finally, sent him to the bench to have his slightly injured left knee 
wrapped and braced. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois (1-1) managed just 193 total yards, compared to Colorado's 475. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois got its lone score midway through the first quarter on a two-yard run 
by Howard Griffith, which capped an 80-yard drive helped by two pass 
interference penalties against Colorado cornerback Dave McCloughan. 
</P>
<P>
The Illini did not cross midfield again until midway through the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Bieniemy's one-yard scoring run capped a 75-yard drive to open the game, 
highlighted by a 74-yard gain on Darian Hagan's pass to Jeff Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
After Illinois drew to a 7-7 tie, the Buffaloes went 80 yards to take the lead 
for good. Bieniemy, from Bishop Amat High School, took a pitchout to the left 
side, stopped and threw a 48-yard scoring strike to a wide-open M.J. Nelson 
with 3:59 left in the first quarter. Nelson is from Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, cornerback David Gibbs picked off George's pass and returned it 
23 yards to the Illinois 38. After a seven-yard loss on a sack, backup tailback 
J.J. Flannigan bolted 45 yards off the right side for a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes padded their margin to 24-7 on a 45-yard Ken Culbertson field 
goal with 1:55 left in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois then had a fumble and interception on its next two series, giving 
Colorado possession at the 34 and 22. Flannigan went nine yards up the middle 
to capitalize on the first turnover, and Bieniemy scored on a four-yard run 
after the second. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois' score came after several interruptions because of crowd noise. The 
Illini were assessed a delay-of-game penalty on one play after George 
repeatedly backed away from center, complaining his teammates couldn't hear the 
snap count. 
</P>
<P>
McCloughan's first penalty, worth 15 yards, put the Illini at the six. He was 
whistled again after a third-down pass fell incomplete, giving Illinois the 
ball at the two and setting up Griffith's score. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy also surrounded Bieniemy's touchdown pass. It was ruled valid only 
after a protracted discussion by the officials. One official whistled the 
Buffaloes for having an ineligible receiver downfield. 
</P>
<P>
It was decided, however, that Colorado tackle Mark Vander Poel had blocked a 
man and then fell forward across the line of scrimmage. But since he did not 
regain his feet to throw another block, there was no violation and the flag was 
waved off.

ALCOHOL IS LEGAL, BUT IT IS A DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with great anticipation "All-Out Against Alcohol" (The Times, Sept. 7) 
but was soon disappointed to see that another error was being promulgated. The 
distinction was repeatedly and incorrectly drawn between "drugs and alcohol." 
This reference fosters confusion and denial. Alcohol is a drug, legal but 
nonetheless dangerous. The text could read "alcohol and other drugs" or "drugs, 
including alcohol." Alcohol is a mind-altering chemical, it risks lives and its 
use can lead to addiction. Therefore, alcohol is a drug.

HOUSING 'LOAF' IS MINUS AN INGREDIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with considerable interest and concern your article entitled "Landlords 
See New Plan's Half a Loaf as a Mere Crumb," (Times, Sept. 7) when taking into 
consideration the offered "half a loaf" does not contain the active ingredients 
to make it rise. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's dictatorial rent control laws over the years have done nothing 
whatsoever to provide or promote "low-income housing for low-income families," 
but merely to maintain "low rental rates" with the beneficiaries being the 
middle- and in many instances upper-class individuals and families. 
</P>
<P>
When a vacancy occurs in Santa Monica, although the city totally dictates the 
rate control of the unit, they have not to date dictated the qualifications for 
the new resident. With justification, the landowner is going to select other 
than a low-income tenant. I am of the opinion that landowners have been told 
for so long what they can do with their properties that out of resentment alone 
they will select affluent tenants rather than poor ones. 
</P>
<P>
The inception of rent control may have been wholly intended as a concentrated 
attempt to provide adequate housing, but it soon became nothing more than a 
tool to either enter politics or enhance a political career. Now who's paying 
for this politics or (to) enhance a political career? Now who's paying for this 
political greed? Yes, low-income families, landowners and the cities. 
</P>
<P>
The politicians of small cities must enact every law available to them to 
minimize homeownership, as any increase in homeownership may become a threat to 
their political well-being. If they can maintain an 80% tenant city, it 
improves their prospect for a continued political career. 
</P>
<P>
Low-income housing is destined for destruction so long as it is nothing more 
than a such cities as demonstrated by such cities as Santa Monica, West 
Hollywood.

WESTWOOD VILLAGE PROJECT DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the developers of a proposed mixed-use project in Westwood Village, we would 
like to take this opportunity to respond to various letters regarding our 
proposed new hotel in the village and correct some misstatements. 
</P>
<P>
Nansay Corp. USA undertook this project with the express intent of fulfilling a 
mandate from the Westwood community as outlined in the Westwood Village 
Specific Plan. Following a design competition, we retained world-class 
architects with a specialty in creating urban, pedestrian-oriented 
environments. We instructed our architects to design a project which embodies 
the spirit of the recently enacted Specific Plan, in conformance with its 
design and use guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the recent controversy regarding the status of the Westwood Horizons 
Retirement Hotel, we -- like the city officials and community leaders who 
endorsed the Specific Plan -- were totally unaware that anyone might interpret 
that building to be a hotel. We continue to believe we are designing a project 
that meets the spirit and intent of the Westwood Specific Plan, which 
represents a compromise and agreement between the various diverse elements of 
the Westwood community. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the impact on the residents of Tiverton Avenue, it should be noted 
that the Specific Plan protects this neighborhood by limiting pedestrian and 
vehicular access, prohibiting retail display and signage, and requiring a 
15-foot landscaped setback on Tiverton. The design of our hotel is sensitive to 
our Tiverton neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
We look forward to continuing our efforts to realize this project in 
cooperation and consultation with the community.

LATINO HAS HIGH HOPES FOR 1ST FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the story begins, marital problems between his Mexican mother and Anglo 
father had sent 12-year-old Mike Rutledge to his grandparents' small Arizona 
ranch, where Spanish is spoken and salsa is spooned over food, not just scooped 
from a bowl with tortilla chips. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the story ends, young Mike -- Miguel Antonio to his loving 
grandparents -- has lost his reluctance to speak Spanish and has brought home 
to suburban Los Angeles a desire to cultivate his Latino roots. 
</P>
<P>
Mike is the central character in a film called "Always Roses." It was produced 
and written by George Figueroa, 25, of Whittier. The Princeton University 
graduate is one of three aspiring film makers chosen from 103 applicants 
nationwide to be part of the Hispanic Film/Video program, spokeswoman Esther 
Renteria said. 
</P>
<P>
The program is sponsored by the National Hispanic Media Coalition, Universal 
Television, the Hispanic Academy of Media Arts and Sciences, and Columbia 
College in Hollywood. Its goal is to encourage and help more Latinos to enter 
and enrich the movie business with their ideas and stories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes for Film Career 
</P>
<P>
The program provides funding and technical assistance to produce short films to 
showcase the talents of the young Latinos, Renteria said. 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa hopes his 24-minute film will catch the eye of a movie executive and 
lead to a film career. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to produce my own scripts and eventually direct them as well," 
Figueroa said in a recent interview. "That's really the only way to control the 
outcome." 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa graduated from Princeton in 1986 with a bachelor's degree in art 
history. He has worked at different jobs as a paralegal and word processor, and 
planned on entering law school to continue a family tradition. His father, 
William, his sister, Ana, and his brother, William Jr., are lawyers. George's 
younger brother, Rafael, attends law school at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Encouraged to Go to Law School 
</P>
<P>
But then Figueroa heard about the film program and submitted a script that was 
accepted for production. The finished film was first shown earlier this month 
in a screening room at Universal Studios. It will be shown Thursday at a film 
symposium at Loyola Marymount University in Westchester, Figueroa said. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally my parents encouraged me to go to law school, but I . . . wanted to 
explore some creative endeavors," Figueroa said. "I put on paper an idea I had 
banging around in my head for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa, who was raised in suburban Whittier and nearby Santa Fe Springs, did 
not have to look far for the themes explored in "Always Roses." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it's difficult growing up in a culture where English is a 
dominating language, and if you convey hints of your ethnic heritage, it can be 
looked down upon," Figueroa said. "You have to overcome that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only been fairly recently that I've been able to really feel a sense of 
pride in my culture and heritage and all that entails, with its language and 
traditions." 
</P>
<P>
The film is not autobiographical, but there are strong parallels to Figueroa's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"What I tried to capture in the script, in the film, were reminiscences, bits 
and pieces of my recollections and experiences of my grandparents from my early 
childhood on," Figueroa said. "I just tried to put together the essence of what 
they were, their pride and their grounding, firmly planted in their roots and 
in their heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 35-millimeter film was shot on location near Tucson, Ariz. It was a 
family affair, with Figueroa's sister helping to co-produce the film. Aunts, 
uncles and cousins provided props and meals for the film crew. The movie was 
produced on a $35,000 budget.

LAST STOP FOR DREAMERS; 
</P>
<P>
MILE ZERO BY THOMAS SANCHEZ (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 334 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alejandro Morales, Morales' most recent novel is The Brick People (Arte 
Publico Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Sanchez spent his youth in Northern California where he began "Rabbit 
Boss," a highly praised first novel chronicling four generations of an Indian 
tribe in the California Sierra Nevada. He later explored Chicano history while 
living in Southern California, where he discovered the theme for his second 
novel, "Zootsuit Murders." After a four year hiatus from writing fiction, 
Sanchez went to the Caribbean, where he discovered Key West, an island smaller 
than the Miami Airport, lying 90 miles off the coast of Cuba. There, several 
events -- the Space Shuttle launchings at nearby Cape Canaveral, a boatload of 
Haitians fleeing Baby Doc, and the confiscation of ever-present boatloads of 
cocaine -- forged in his mind "a new American metaphor" which became his third 
novel, "Mile Zero." Sanchez has called it his "cosmic Cannery Row." 
</P>
<P>
With the novel's panoramic opening of the Space Shuttle hurtling toward new 
frontiers, Sanchez places the reader in Key West, where desperate refugees flee 
to a dream of sanctuary in America while sleek powerboats race for a 
championship cup. Sanchez tells the story of 1960s refugees whose paths cross 
in this Caribbean paradise. 
</P>
<P>
St. Cloud, a political activist who worked against the Vietnam War, ironically 
guilt-ridden for not participating in the war, lives in a constant alcoholic 
haze. He crosses paths with Voltaire, a teen-aged Haitian accused of murder who 
is the only survivor of an ill-fated refugee boat. He meets Lila, a secretive 
young Southern woman, who was an abused child and now struggles to break the 
psychological spell of M. K. (Monkey Killer), a perverted Vietnam veteran and 
cocaine smuggler who participates in Central American civil wars. St. Cloud is 
hired as an interpreter by Justo Tamarindo, a Cuban American police officer, 
who understands Key West's legacy of slavery, the Cuban Revolution, and the 
volatile present of the marijuana, cocaine runners, the wretched illegal 
immigrants, the leftover drug-fried hippies of a past generation and the 
practitioners of Voodoo and Santeria. 
</P>
<P>
St. Cloud and his wife Evelyn represent the human wreckage of the Vietnam 
generation, whose lives have been shattered against the materialistic reefs of 
consumer America. They are hippies of the '60s who have become the disenchanted 
yuppies of the '80s. Evelyn's disappointment with life is based on her past. 
Her anti-war commitment drove her to desperate extremes. She repeatedly 
sacrificed her body to save the lives of young men of draft age. "Evelyn could 
not stop a war, but she could start a man's conscience. Some of the bland-faced 
recruits walked away from her bed, away from the airfield, drifted down the 
highway, distancing themselves from a killer identity before it was too late, 
abandoning their own names and families, slipping into neutral countries, or 
disappearing into the cracks of a burgeoning underground." 
</P>
<P>
In Key West, Evelyn and St. Cloud become estranged. "The unshakable guilt of 
Vietnam became St. Cloud's mistress, swelling to disproportionate balance 
between himself and Evelyn." Evelyn finds herself in another woman and St. 
Cloud falls into alcoholism and madly in love with Lila, a girl about 20 years 
old, who "was born on the losing side of the American tracks, who leaves her 
violent husband to become entangled with the cold- blooded and psychologically 
twisted M. K." "St. Cloud did not know if his heart was being tricked by the 
fatal attraction of false romantic lights, leading him in desperate pursuit of 
his own lost youth." The absent, mysterious and indestructible M. K. is a 
character whom Sanchez seems to have added to portray the soldier as a victim 
of the Vietnam War. By weaving together these many little narratives about the 
people of Key West, Sanchez creates a magnificent tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
Explicitly more powerful than any of Sanchez's disenchanted Euro-Anglo 
characters, however, is Justo Tamarindo, whose efforts to solve a bizarre 
murder deeply involve him in the rituals of Voodoo and Santeria. As a literary 
creation Justo is remarkable, standing far above Sanchez's other characters. 
Taking great pride in his identity and heritage, Justo is their opposite in 
values and attitude toward life. In Justo Sanchez forges a new race, a new 
world vision, for in him Afro-Cuban, Latin American and Euro-Anglo cultures 
come together. In tracing Justo's familial roots, Sanchez splendidly narrates 
the history of slavery and the contribution of Afro-Cubans in the tobacco and 
fishing industries of Key West. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sanchez, Key West has died a thousand deaths, going from the 
richest city in America to the poorest. Key West died when the Shipwreck Laws 
changed, when the turtles were all slaughtered, and when the lucrative slave 
auctions were abolished. Justo's family survived these deaths, always bearing 
seeds, to change the status quo. Justo's awareness of past and present history 
simultaneously brings these people together and sets them apart. 
</P>
<P>
There cannot be a future without a past: in this knowledge rests the strength 
of Justo and St. Cloud. It is the weakness, in contrast, of M. K. and Voltaire, 
weakness for they can neither face the past nor the present. They stand on the 
"Southernmost point it is called, mile zero. Last hope for star-crossed 
creatures dreaming in tropical pastures at the end of the American road. Last 
Hope." 
</P>
<P>
Rich in the cultural and literary intertextuality of Steinbeck and Cervantes, 
Joyce and Shakespeare, "Mile Zero" is an accomplished novel. Yet Sanchez 
falters: He has created truly interesting characters but placed them in a 
meandering story. Their stories are individualized rather than united in a 
clear and concise plot. In trying to help Voltaire, the mysterious Haitian 
refugee, Justo discovers a bizarre murder. While pursuing the crime Justo loses 
track of Voltaire. The resolution to Voltaire's situation and the murder reads 
contrived. Voltaire is struck down by a car and the crazed murderer 
disappointedly turns out to be a deranged residual hippie called Space Cadet; 
and Zobop, who took on mythic dimensions, is his stream of conscience. It is 
precisely the multiplicity of actions and characters in the last two sections 
that weaken and subvert Sanchez's novel. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the convoluted plot, "Mile Zero" remains worthwhile reading. For 
beneath its abundant layers of information and symbolism there is disguised a 
political meaning. Sanchez might call it a "moral moment" exemplified in Justo 
Tamarindo, who, unlike the decadent, bacchanalian and disillusioned Euro-Anglo 
characters, represents the hope and future of Key West. Sanchez has declared 
that ". . . Without Justo I never would have made it through 'Mile Zero.' Justo 
knew everything there was to know about Key West, about Cuba, about men and 
women, family and individual honor, spiritualism and the spirit -- he is 
probably the most moral man I have met, in or out of a book." The reader is 
left with a desire to know more about this extraordinary man.

RICHARD EDER: RESISTING THE PULL OF TRADITION; 
</P>
<P>
JASMINE BY BHARATI MUKHERJEE (GROVE: $17.95; 190 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We receive periodic messages -- daily, it sometimes seems -- to the effect that 
the line between our First World and the Third World grows less and less 
distinct. 
</P>
<P>
The news from the urban slums and ghettos, the fragility of the suburbs, the 
swamping of public systems of education and health, the widening gap between 
rich and poor, corruption or laxity in the IRS, the savings and loan industry 
and the housing agencies, the drug and AIDS epidemics -- all these suggest that 
the control of life that we always thought of as marking a developed society is 
slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
The messages come in; we hear them but don't really absorb them. Each new one 
-- the video of a hanged Marine colonel, for example -- is a new shock. "Yes, 
there is a world out there," we think, and the thought dissipates. 
</P>
<P>
Bharati Mukherjee's novel, "Jasmine," is an artful and arresting distillation 
of these messages. A Hindu woman flees her family's poverty, and the Sikh 
terrorism that bloodies her village and claims her husband's life, and comes to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
After a time in New York -- only a foreign eye could fix the world of the Upper 
West Side with such hilarious and revealing estrangement -- she moves to a 
small town in Iowa. In corn and hog country -- now prey to farm foreclosures 
and despair -- she marks with unsparing brilliance the symptoms of a new Third 
World. 
</P>
<P>
"Iowa's dull and flat," a New York friend had protested when he heard she would 
move there. "So is Punjab," she replied. It could be the epigraph for this 
unsettling and finely written book. Jyoti -- moving westward, she becomes 
successively Jasmine and Jane -- is an immigrant of a different kind. 
Traditionally, America thinks of its immigrants coming here in order to be able 
to say: We are you. Jasmine's message is: You are us. 
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee interweaves Jasmine's past and present, juxtaposing her childhood and 
growing-up in the Indian countryside with her time in New York and her present 
life in Iowa. The juxtaposition, which can be breathtaking, serves to fortify 
her comparisons. Her childhood took place amid the collapse of a millennial way 
of life. In Iowa, her symbol for America, a briefer but even more powerful way 
of life is ending. 
</P>
<P>
Jasmine is a rebel; she will not get caught. She flees India and, at the end, 
she will flee Iowa. The book begins when, at age 7, she refuses to accept the 
prophesy of a holy man that she will become a widow and an exile. He swats her 
and she falls down, gouging a hole in her forehead. The scar, she insists, is 
her third eye, denoting wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
She is precocious, beautiful and arrogant. She feels the pull of tradition, 
both in India and in Iowa; but she will not let it pull her down. She can look 
both ways -- her argument to a New York physicist for the submersion of the 
individual will in the mind of God is comedy that singes -- but ultimately she 
moves one way: On. 
</P>
<P>
Her wavering, though, gives richness to the book. She defies her traditionalist 
father, who wants her to marry a farmer, and insists on studying. When she 
meets an independent-minded young man, Prakash, she marries him in totally 
untraditional fashion. In their brief married life, though, he must constantly 
challenge her to go beyond the customary role of the Indian wife. 
</P>
<P>
After youth comes violence. Prakash is killed by a Sikh bomb on the eve of 
emigrating to the United States. Jasmine goes instead, entering Florida as an 
illegal. The ship captain who smuggles her in rapes her in a motel; she stabs 
him to death. The incident is horrifying but she tells it with fatalistic 
levelness. All experience is experience. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, she gets a job as an au pair to a trendy academic couple. Taylor 
and Wylie treat her, to her astonishment, as a member of the family. Since 
their daughter, Duff, is enrolled in a progressive kindergarten, her duties are 
light. She finds herself earning $40 an hour as a language tutor to students in 
the Asian studies program at Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
It is an idyll but, as she puts it: "In America nothing lasts." Wylie falls in 
love with Stuart, a Columbia colleague of Taylor's, while out 
Christmas-caroling on the upper West Side. "Taylor's such a sweetheart," she 
tells Jasmine, "and there's Duff and Stuart's three kids, but this is my chance 
at real happiness. What can I do? I've got to go for it, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Jasmine might have stayed -- she and Taylor have fallen in love -- but one day 
she sees the Sikh, who killed her husband, selling ice cream in the park. It is 
a premonitory hint of Third World infiltration. She flies to Iowa; in America's 
heartland, she will surely be safe from history's turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
But Iowa is not what it was. Desperate farmers attack bankers or commit 
suicide. Bud, a local banker, has come back from a trip to the Far East with a 
radically enlarged outlook. He is smitten with Jasmine, and she moves in with 
him after he leaves his wife. Not only that; they adopt Du, a Vietnamese 
refugee. 
</P>
<P>
Jasmine tries to become "Jane," but it's no use. A farmer on whom Bud is 
foreclosing shoots him in the back. He is confined to a wheelchair; Jasmine 
must not only nurse him but offer him sexual relief in a highly complex 
fashion. "I will do it," she says stoically. 
</P>
<P>
"Care-giver" is indeed part of her divided nature, but only part. When Taylor 
comes to get her -- it seems a hastily contrived ending -- she goes. 
</P>
<P>
If Jasmine as a small and high-strung Goddess of Flux is comical in New York, 
she is devastating in Iowa. Her level voice delicately but relentlessly brings 
out the contradictions of a world trying in vain to resist or ignore the 
passing of its self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Bud is the perfect symbol. He is all-American yet he has left his all-American 
wife to take an Indian mistress and adopt a Vietnamese son. He believes 
passionately in farming but forecloses on the farmers. 
</P>
<P>
In Mukherjee's tale -- glib and a trifle haughty, sometimes, but always 
absorbing -- he is America itself; believing sincerely in its own good life and 
good intentions, yet crippled to paralysis by the retribution that life takes 
on any empire of faith that fails to move on with it.

A LITERARY QUILT OF FADED COLORS; 
</P>
<P>
KEEP THE CHANGE BY THOMAS MCGUANE (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $17.95; 230 PP.;

<TEXT>
<P>
The irrepressible Thomas McGuane strides forth once again, in this his 10th 
book and seventh novel, to take on nothing less than the breadth and troubled 
essence themselves of native life in end-of-the-century America. In the McGuane 
mode, it's a book that seems to set out to do all things -- dazzle, satirize, 
embrace, lament, and perhaps at end to salvage the pieces of a lesser world. 
The work disappoints, though seeming itself, by the finish, to be less an 
antidote to that world than another piece of it. 
</P>
<P>
The literary energies of the indefatigable McGuane can put a reader in mind of 
something like a many-colored quilt -- there's the outdoor flavor and manliness 
of Hemingway over there, of course (and there, and there), here are some 
swatches of the ribald and word-happy picaresques of J. P. Donleavy, others of 
the anti-hero comics of Amis and the Angry Young Men; there's the bold and 
nervy strain of the American satirists of class and commerce, from Sinclair 
Lewis on down; and here's the poetic and telling observer of baffled small 
lives in backwater places, the imager of quietly despairing Americana 
descending from, say, Sherwood Anderson and the early regionalists. 
</P>
<P>
These are noble antecedents, to a one, and their emergence in the uneven fabric 
of McGuane's work -- now here, now there -- can result in moments of brief and 
captivating, sometimes hilarious, brilliance. But the whole cloth that's woven 
from them, the overall result, the book itself and the inner spirit of it -- 
these can be another matter. Not quite satire that's held at a level of 
sustained effectiveness, not quite a non-satiric novel of felt experience, not 
quite a successful blending of the two, "Keep the Change" reads instead, echo 
of its own title, like disappointingly half-hearted work, tossed-together 
leftovers, a project without the ability or inner conviction to find out what 
it really is or what it's really for. 
</P>
<P>
What feels empty and perfunctory at the heart of the book may be a result of 
what's empty and perfunctory at the core (intentionally or not is another 
question) of McGuane's chosen hero this time around. Born and reared on a 
cattle ranch in Montana, Joe Starling Jr. is portrayed from the start as being 
unsure whether or not he wants to inherit his birthright of open land. His 
heavy-drinking father ranched it, went on to become a banker and then "an 
agricultural executive," but nevertheless is presumed still to love the land, 
and in the early pages of the book he counsels son Joe, in the sped-up tropes 
of comic Western parody, not to "let that old s.o.b. Overstreet get it. He 
tried to break me when I came into this country and he darn near got it done. 
We get along okay now but his dream is to make his ranch a perfect square and 
this is a big bite out of his southeast corner." 
</P>
<P>
That Joe's father soon dies without having properly clarified Joe's title to 
the ranch will provide later plot complications, but more centrally at issue is 
Joe's attitude toward his would-be inheritance. "Joe loved the place but he 
didn't expect or really want to end up on it altogether," we read. And, 
considering the probable fact that the land "would one day be his," Joe 
concludes this to be "not precisely a soaring thought. He really wondered how 
he would put his heritage in play. He found the future eerie and he already 
wanted to paint." 
</P>
<P>
All could be well with the book if a reader were actually able to feel the 
truth of either side of the double premise -- that Joe "loved the place" on the 
one hand, and that he "wanted to paint" on the other. But both ideas, in spite 
of McGuane's often desultory efforts to pull them into vitality, stubbornly 
remain more like identifying labels on a string-operated figure than like inner 
convictions deriving from a genuine psychological life. Given this limitation, 
the author gains free license to move his character around at will: to send him 
(after a summer of working -- and losing his virginity -- on the ranch) out 
East, where he graduates from Yale, strives half successfully (so McGuane says, 
but never shows) to become a serious painter, and ends up in Florida, and then 
allows the author just as freely to send him fleeing again back to Montana on a 
putatively spiritual quest to reclaim his heritage and roots. 
</P>
<P>
It's as though, again and again, Joe were less a real character than a pre-made 
and movable device to let McGuane write about whatever he might want to write 
about: the jaded and decadent tackiness of Florida; the flamboyantly and yet 
conventionally sexy Astrid, whom Joe hooks up with in Florida and stays 
half-involved with throughout the book; the worn-out town of McGuane's 
Deadrock, near the ranch; the sleazy and boundless opportunism of cheap 
entrepreneur Ivan ("Man was meant to consume") Slater, ex-Yale classmate; or 
the restaurant of the Yale Club in New York, where there's a hilarious moment 
in a scene that is, as it happens, wholly extraneous narratively. 
</P>
<P>
It's unarguably true that a novel could succeed perfectly well in this way -- 
as a purely linear comedy, aiming first for brightness and maybe not at all for 
depth, exploiting a character who's primarily just a narrative convenience; but 
McGuane's book struggles uneasily against the limits of just these traits, 
leading the author, to telegraph to the reader again and again, as if in 
nagging afterthoughts, the thematically deeper sides of what Joe is supposedly 
thinking or feeling, as in banal and empty lines such as "Joe was maddened by 
joy at being in the country of the West. He felt that he would find a restored 
condition for his life here." 
</P>
<P>
McGuane's eye is sharp and his quick aim often perfect, especially in small 
things, as when Joe is on the road from Florida to Montana ("A radio preacher 
shouted, 'Satan is playing hardball!' "), or when he notices in a tidy 
residential part of Deadrock that "On most lawns, a tiny white newspaper lay 
like a seed," or in describing the Dickensian figure of Joe's Uncle Smitty, a 
shell-shocked alcoholic still living (or so he lets on) in the world of 1945 -- 
who himself makes a wily grab for the money tied up in the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
But the book as a whole labors both for meaning and material: descends at one 
moment to farce, appeals at the next to high melodrama; allows Joe for long 
sections to forget important things like his (he thinks) illegitimate daughter, 
then suddenly hyperbolizes their urgency and significance; at one moment 
romanticizes the land and Joe's desire for it, at the next suggests that there 
wasn't much certainty of will there anyhow, concluding with half wistful 
toss-aways such as the one suggested when Astrid, who followed him to Montana, 
turns away from Joe: "It had been lovely, anyway," he muses. "It was a 
provisional life." 
</P>
<P>
It may be, of course, that McGuane is a jump ahead of the reader, intending all 
along, against odds, to make something, anything, out of half abandoned, worn, 
or leftover material: to write, as part of the message, only a provisional 
book. At one point, when they are still in Florida, Astrid asks Joe why it is 
that he doesn't paint anymore. His answer is: "Paint what?" It's a question 
that seems to speak to the whole of this often skilled yet self-consciously 
jaunty and oddly mechanical book that, purposely or otherwise, is about the 
absence of things and emptiness.

PRIMATE VISIONS GENDER, RACE, AND NATURE IN THE WORLD OF MODERN SCIENCE BY 
DONNA J. HARAWAY (ROUTLEDGE: $35; 472 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-415-90114-6) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Sperling, Sperling is a physical anthropologist and author of Animal 
Liberators: Research and Morality (1988, University of California Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Primate Visions" is about the ways in which scientific accounts of the lives 
of animals -- specifically those most closely related to us -- are intertwined 
with our concepts of gender, race, and nature. Depictions of monkeys and apes 
tell us much about ourselves, or, to paraphrase Pogo: "We have met the 
primates, and they are us." Both scientific accounts and popular images of 
monkeys and apes reflect sometimes-disturbing projections of human problems. 
</P>
<P>
Haraway precedes from the assumption that monkeys and apes occupy the crucial 
border zone between culture and nature; in the book we see them catapulted into 
space, taught to communicate with humans, or portrayed as symbols of "lost 
innocence" in a Third World devoid of indigenous human actors. In this 
mythological terrain, a lone white girl named Jane meets the innocent ape and 
both are transfigured. Through Haraway's lens, we see that the National 
Geographic vision of Africa bears a stronger resemblance to Disney World than 
to the African reality -- it is a theme park of the late 20th-Century 
industrial West's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Haraway is chairman of the history of consciousness program at UC Santa Cruz, 
and a leading figure in post-modern deconstructionism. "Primate Visions" is 
about the way in which scientific accounts reflect and create our natural 
cosmology. Haraway is at her best when she monkeys brilliantly with some of our 
most precious symbols, at her worst when her language is inaccessible to a 
layperson not steeped in post-modern criticism. This is an important book that 
deserves the widest possible audience. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of the book historically contextualizes the modern view of 
primates. In a chapter entitled "Teddy Bear Patriarchy" we are led through the 
great halls of the American Museum of Natural History. Here, Teddy Roosevelt's 
patriarchal ideals of manhood are reflected in the African Hall dioramas in 
which stuffed animals are mounted in family groupings to symbolize the "purity 
of nature." African Hall was the work of Carl Akeley, the artist, scientist and 
hunter who collected and stuffed African animals beginning in the 1880s. "From 
the dead body of the primate Akeley crafted something finer than the living 
organism; he achieved its true end, a new genesis. Decadence -- the threat of 
the city, civilization, machine -- was stayed in the politics of eugenics and 
the art of taxidermy." 
</P>
<P>
The magnificent silverback male gorilla of which Haraway writes, was killed in 
1921, the same year the museum hosted a large international gathering of 
eugenicists. She connects the vision in the dioramas to the obsession with 
"genetic hygiene" of many early 20th-Century Americans and Europeans. Like the 
dioramas, eugenics contrasted the woes of civilization with the goodness of 
nature. By showing us African Hall as "simultaneously a very strange place and 
an ordinary experience for literally millions of North Americans" Haraway 
points out how strange our ordinary reality is. No one who has read "Teddy Bear 
Patriarchy" will ever experience a trip to the Museum of Natural History in 
quite the same way as before. 
</P>
<P>
Haraway devotes later chapters to modern primate field and laboratory studies. 
She connects the portrayals of white women watching apes in the Third World to 
First World anxieties about African decolonization. We read what is left out of 
the National Geographic accounts: Jane Goodall and her mother making 2,000 Spam 
sandwiches for Belgian troops fleeing their former colony; a cage constructed 
for Goodall's son, to protect him from the chimpanzees. National Geographic 
omits the African political context in which Goodall's work took place. 
</P>
<P>
In a final section of the book, Haraway presents biographies of four modern 
primatologists -- all of them women. It is probably not coincidental that 
primatology is the only branch of evolutionary studies with a predominance of 
successful women practitioners. Women are identified with nature and figure 
importantly in the mythological construction of the primate Garden of Eden. 
Women primatologists have contested male-centered origin stories by placing 
female monkeys and apes center stage in their accounts, and emphasizing female 
primate agency. 
</P>
<P>
Because Haraway is interested in reading primatology as text, she avoids 
questions about what is scientific fact versus poorly supported theoretical 
speculation. One primatologist whose work Haraway discusses is a leading 
proponent of sociobiology (the theory that animals and humans follow strategies 
that insure that the greatest number of their own genes will survive in future 
generations). The primatologist speaks of female monkeys, apes and humans as 
competitive, assertive, dominance- oriented and looking out for their own 
genetic advantage. It seems that female primates of the 1980s have taken their 
places in the board room of primate troops that resemble corporate culture. 
</P>
<P>
Haraway points out the ways in which this new image of female primates mirrors 
late 20th-Century capitalist society. But sociobiology has been criticized for 
its failure to document actual behavior across the primate life cycle. Because 
a researcher seems to tell a good "feminist" story (i.e. that female primates 
are strategists for their own genetic advantage) does not mean that the work is 
good science. Sociobiology is genetic reductionism. It implies that gendered 
behaviors are controlled by genes. There is much evidence that this is not the 
case for humans, apes or monkeys. While all scientific stories may be read as 
myth, some are also poor science. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging and engaging, "Primate Visions" holds up a mirror to some of our 
favorite myths about animals. It shows us that we are not innocent; a Sunday at 
the museum or an evening in front of television are laden with meanings and 
deep ambiguities at the heart of our ideas about human and animal.

PERILOUS VERSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Kushwant Singh's article on Salman Rushdie's case, "How India Lost a 
Great Writer" (Book Review, Aug. 27) was informative, going so far as to rue 
the loss to India of a great writer, it begs what may be the question of the 
heart of the matter: I mean ignorance and despotism. 
</P>
<P>
To any disinterested reader, the novel's theme is simply and clearly that of 
reconciliation: the son with the father, and a man with his natal culture. It 
is the loss to Indian culture that Singh deplores, indirectly condemning, so 
far it is safe for him to do so, Indian bigotry. If he is not condemning that, 
then he weeps crocodile tears. 
</P>
<P>
What Singh fails to mention, and none of the reviewers of "The Satanic Verses" 
has pointed it out either, so mesmerized by the brouhaha over Rushdie's acid 
mockery of false, mythologized history enshrined as articles of faith by 
dictatorial mullahs, is the most likely cause of the Ayatollah Khomeini's 
interdiction: his direct attack on the overthrow of the Shah's regime by the 
fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
In a digression of only seven pages in the American edition (210-216), Rushdie 
tells in a fairy- tale style of the overthrow of the "Empress of Persia" by 
waves of fanatic students. The new regime, under the "Imam," undertakes to 
abolish history and replace it with eternity. Eternity in our historical world 
of living things of course can only mean a living death. And that has always 
been the aim of despots. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, those mere seven pages may have come to seem, even to Rushdie, a 
fatally gratuitous misstep. They may be what brought about the Ayatollah's ire, 
and resulted in his decree of death against the writer who mocked him 
personally. All the rest, the furor of demonstrations, the rioting, seems to 
have followed upon the issuance of Khomeini's ukase -- the order went out, a 
murder contract was publicly announced. One may be pardoned for thinking that 
Islam has little enough to do with it all, since the world is well aware that 
practically none of the people in those mobs of Indian and Pakistani protesters 
could have read "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
So far as those seven pages written against the Ayatollah are concerned, it 
should also be remarked that the defense of Rushdie's freedom to write satire 
against tyrants is ultimately based on them alone, and not on the arabesquerie 
of his immensely witty historical fantasies. To my recollection, none of the 
many speakers in the protests against censorship of Rushdie made that point. 
But that is what lies at the heart of the struggle against intimidation by 
terrorists who threaten publishers and booksellers. Inasmuch as the death 
sentence has not been revoked by Khomeini's heirs -- Rushdie must remain in 
protective custody -- let us not forget that all who dare to criticize are 
still the potential targets of terrorist attacks directed by fundamentalist 
despotism.

ROSE-COLORED RETROSPECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reviewing Barbara Ehrenreich's new "Fear of Falling" (Book Review, Aug. 20), 
David Rieff states: "In the 1950s, as Ehrenreich demonstrates brilliantly, 
American writers, academics and politicians all came perilously close to 
agreeing with the college newspaper editor who remarked in 1957 that "All the 
problems are solved." Even Arthur Schlesinger Jr. asserted that the problems of 
poverty had been largely eliminated though there remained "enclaves where the 
underprivileged still can be found, as in the Southern Alleghenies or the rural 
Deep South.' " 
</P>
<P>
This is a joke. No matter how many fantasy pronouncements were made at the time 
-- or now in retrospect -- the fact is that this country faced an economic 
recession in the late '50s when unemployment climbed above the "dangerous" 6% 
mark . . and not just in the Alleghenies or the Deep South. Don't take my word 
for it; just check the records. 
</P>
<P>
Explanation for this schism is simple. Economists -- whether their names are 
Ehrenreich, Schlesinger, Greenspan or Volcker -- all inhabit a different 
planet, breathe different air, than do the rest of us. They're no more reliable 
today than were their predecessors 60 years ago who preached that "The business 
of America is business" and that prosperity was here to stay.

THE ILLNESS AND THE CURE

<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Mairs' review of Anne Stevenson's "Bitter Fame: A Life of Sylvia Plath" 
(Book Review, Aug. 20) brought to mind the tragic and yet successful life of 
the late Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Theodore Roethke (1908-1963). Subject to 
periodic attacks of manic depression, Roethke fought to overcome his possibly 
inherited and gene-based disease and to use the experiences of the attacks in 
his writings. As the biographer Allan Seager wrote: "The very qualities that 
made Ted a poet seem to have been the ones that made him ill -- his sensitivity 
and his energy."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: GOODBYE, COLUMBUS BY PHILIP ROTH (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $7.95)

Thirty years ago, Philip Roth burst onto the American literary scene with this 
outrageous collection of short stories. He may not have invented the characters 
of the Jewish-American Princess and the overbearing Jewish mother that occupy 
so large a place in contemporary fiction, but he epitomized them with rare 
humor as Brenda Patimkin and Aunt Gladys in "Goodbye, Columbus." (Baby-boomers 
who endured the 1969 Ali MacGraw-Richard Benjamin film will discover that its 
longeurs have not tarnished the wit of the original story.) 
</P>
<P>
Roth's merciless but affectionate stories of upper-middle-class Jewish life in 
America have lost none of their pungency. "The Conversion of the Jews" pits a 
literal-minded Yeshiva student against a conventionally pious rabbi; a shakren 
(liar) gets a richly deserved comeuppance in "The Defender of the Faith"; an 
Americanized lawyer learns the perils of judging by appearances in "Eli, the 
Fanatic." Delightfully irreverent reading to brighten the gray monotony of 
autumn in Los Angeles.

A scion of the Aldrich and Rockefeller families, the author writes with 
first-hand knowledge about the problems and popular images of people who 
inherit large sums of money. The need to prove that they have some worth beyond 
their unearned wealth often leads heirs into desperate self-indulgence or 
charity work and politics. George Bush, who comes from a wealthy family, had to 
overcome the stereotype of the rich boy as wimp in his presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Middle-class readers who have to struggle with monthly bills and the cost of 
housing in Southern California may find it difficult to sympathize with people 
whose lives have been cushioned by trust funds, estates and servants. But as 
the gap between rich and poor widens in this country, "Old Money" offers 
valuable insights into the group that threatens to monopolize wealth and power 
in America.

Drawing on such unconventional sources as popular advice columns, school

American mores between 1920 and 1960. During these decades, the shift to a 
mobil, urban, industrialized society, combined with the Depression and World 
War II to effect profound changes in attitudes toward dating, sex and marriage

During the '30s, "date-and-rate" was the accepted pattern. Young people were 
encouraged to have as many dates as possible, and the girl or boy with the most 
partners was considered the most successful and desirable. The search for 
security in the post-war world reversed this model: Going steady became the 
rule, and the person with the fewest partners won. An intriguing book that 
reveals just how much the feminist and sexual revolutions have accomplished -- 
and how much of the struggle for equality has yet to be won.

DERRING-DO IN A LAND WITHOUT SPICE; 
</P>
<P>
BRIGHTEN THE CORNER WHERE YOU ARE BY FRED CHAPPELL (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $15.95; 
212 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Harry Middleton, Middleton is the author of The Earth Is Enough (Simon &amp; 
Schuster) and the forthcoming Dancing on the Spine of Time (Simon &amp; 
Schuster). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His name is Joe Robert Kirkman. He is a science teacher at the Tipton high 
school in the mountains of North Carolina and he is in big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkman is a man who likes to push life, feel it completely, live it fully. He 
delights in risks and challenge, in all that life is -- its great joys, its 
telling tragedies, its promise and potential. Admirable characteristics, you 
would think, especially for a high school science teacher, but Kirkman's 
exuberance for life has gotten him, at last, into more trouble than he can 
handle. Perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
In this deeply felt, warm, and funny novel, Fred Chappell, one of the South's 
and indeed the country's finest writers, introduces us to a character whose 
passion for life, for the hardness of truth, changes not only his life, but the 
lives of those around him. 
</P>
<P>
Chappell's narrative, told by young Jess, Kirkman's son (Chappell readers will 
remember Jess from the novel "I Am One of You Forever"), probes close to bone 
and nerve, giving us a telling portrait not only of Joe Robert Kirkman, but of 
life in the small mountain town of Tipton just at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
As this single day in the life of Kirkman unravels so does the life of Tipton, 
in all its darkness and promise. Chappell, a master storyteller, weaves a 
wonderful tale, one full of wild humor and honest humanity, all of it surfacing 
in but a single day in a man's life. 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, no ordinary day, but then Kirkman is no ordinary science 
teacher. Besides being a teacher, Kirkman is a farmer, an outdoorsman, 
something of a philosopher, and a most inventive and imaginative dreamer. In a 
place "so lacking in spice," he is a man of "derring-do." Tipton, N.C., is a 
town in need of a jolt of passion and Kirkman is just the man to deliver the 
blow. Kirkman can feel it's time to make his mark on life: "His glory days were 
coming. He could feel the bright glow of them on his face like a rising dawn." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkman's less than traditional teaching methods, especially concerning his 
handling of Darwin and the theory of evolution, have landed him in hot water 
with the local school board which has called a special session. Kirkman is to 
appear before them, explain himself. But things aren't going well for Kirkman. 
His day and his life seem star-struck. The day begins with Kirkman in the deep 
mountain night up a tree battling what he calls a devil-opossum (a bobcat) and 
getting the worst of the encounter; saving a drowning child in Trivet Creek and 
ruining his only suit in the process; meeting a ghost in the school's basement, 
and trying to coax a philosophical goat off the high school's roof and losing. 
And so on. By the time of his meeting with the school board, it seems Joe 
Robert Kirkman is indeed doomed. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes things work out, even if it takes a little magic, and it does 
here, but Chappell, a novelist and poet of great range and talent, handles it 
with great humor and grace, making it magic of the best sort: not just 
possible, but believable.

Public hearings continue Monday on the environmental impact report for the 
controversial Foothill/Trabuco Specific Plan, which would establish development 
guidelines for 6,500 acres of backcountry east of Mission Viejo. County 
planners have recommended that 1,700 new homes be allowed in the hill and 
canyon country. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists gained a victory last week when the Planning Commission 
recommended that Rose Canyon Road -- a three-mile-long proposed road through 
Trabuco Canyon -- be eliminated from the county's master plan of highways. The 
County Board of Supervisors is expected to vote on the specific plan later this 
year.

ENJOYING FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Violence is by no means an abstract problem. You can be confronted by it at any 
time. My best high school friend was shot and killed recently in his own home, 
by a friend of his. This was entirely unexpected; Lee Fox was as gentle as they 
come, and was inclined to counter potential arguments with gentle humor, or 
walk away from a fight if necessary. If he can be shot, so can any of your 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
My chief regret, of course, is that I didn't enjoy more time with him while he 
was alive. Good friends (and even married couples) drift apart not because they 
"grow away" from each other, but because they don't take the time to sit and 
relax and chew the fat a little, early and often. They become numbed by the 
day-in, year-out routine of making a living and doing chores. It's a trap. 
</P>
<P>
So take the time, while you have the time, to enjoy your friends. In our 
violent society, Jack Smith's advice is all the more important: Spend all your 
kisses.

'SOUTH LAGUNA'S FORGOTTEN GIANT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your recent article concerning the property in South Laguna formerly owned by 
Richard Halliburton ("South Laguna's Forgotten Giant," Sept. 3) brought back 
nostalgic memories. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter mentioned that Halliburton had swum the Dardanelles and crossed 
the Alps on an elephant. These two observations, made in such matter-of-fact 
fashion, do not describe the reasons for those adventures. 
</P>
<P>
Halliburton swam the Hellespont (Dardanelles) to repeat the legendary 
accomplishment of Leander according to the myth of Hero and Leander. Leander 
was a Greek youth who was in love with Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite, confined 
to a temple across the Hellespont. Leander would swim the five-mile distance 
nightly, guided by a lantern placed by Hero in a tower. Unfortunately, so the 
legend goes, the lantern blew out one night in a storm, and Leander lost his 
way and perished, bringing the love affair to a tragic end. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of crossing the Alps by elephant was to follow in the footsteps of 
the Carthaginian general Hannibal who defeated the Roman armies in the second 
Punic War, in the period 218 to 202 B.C. Hannibal's feat of crossing the Alps 
to attack by land brought him victory; prior to that the wars had involved sea 
battles which cost both sides large numbers of warriors. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter's unadorned factual statements that Halliburton swam the 
Hellespont and rode an elephant across the Alps do not do justice to the 
reasons for those heroic achievements. If the reporter had been at Mudville 
that fateful day, he would probably have written that "the Mudville nine lost 
after Casey struck out to end the game." But still, the article was very 
informative and interesting, and I am glad to have had a chance to read it. My 
sincere compliments to James Carlton, your staff writer for his outstanding 
article.

BEACH POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am an 18-year resident of Laguna Beach, and do not like to see our beach 
reputation so diminished by several years of unacceptable polluting of our 
shores because of defective equipment, lack of monitoring devices and power 
outages. 
</P>
<P>
The rationalizations offered by the city mothers and fathers offend: the 
situation cannot be controlled, the equipment cannot be fixed, a monitoring 
system is too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The situation can be remedied. Our beaches can be pristine. Visitors will come 
and spend all their cash to fill Laguna coffers. All the situation requires is 
money and renewed respect for the environment by the City Council. Not to 
systematically remedy the problem now as a first priority will ruin Laguna's 
reputation and continue to do so long after the town has been made to solve the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Just tell us how much it will cost and how the steps to be taken will be 
financed. And let's get on with it tomorrow.

There were no arrests for public intoxication, drugs or assaults with lethal 
weapons. I imagine that that is the best day the park has had.

ROHRABACHER AND FUNDING FOR THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am sorry that Rep. Dana Rohrabacher feels that art is "frivolous" and that 
he, in all his wisdom, feels compelled to stand in judgment of one's creative 
expression. Our country was founded by visionaries, willing to take chances. 
</P>
<P>
After generations of personal repression, our founding fathers (and mothers) 
were willing to give their lives for the opportunity of enjoying the basic 
freedom of self-expression. 
</P>
<P>
How sad that now our leaders in Congress attack that right as frivolous. Stay 
in line. Don't make waves. Our country must continue to progress without 
basking in the laurels of its past. 
</P>
<P>
The future is a product of the creative spirit embodied in our artists, our 
designers, our teachers and all those with a vision of what could be. 
Rohrabacher and Sen. Jesse Helms seem threatened by the power of this creative 
spirit and have a wish to bask in all that is comfortable and accountable. 
</P>
<P>
Our culture will stagnate without persons in power with vision, imagination and 
creativity! Art is not frivolous. It is the spirit we need as a people to 
continue and be great.

ROHRABACHER AND FUNDING FOR THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re the proposed amendment to restrict National Endowment for the Arts funding 
for "indecent art," introduced by Sen. Jesse Helms and championed by Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Lomita): 
</P>
<P>
Although I've always been against censorship of any kind, the above amendment 
didn't incense me enough to write, until I read Rohrabacher's remark quoted in 
The Times: "I don't believe that the government in a time of severe deficit 
crisis, should be spending money on frivolous things like the arts in the first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
What pre-Cro-Magnon mentality would coin such a phrase? Indeed, as far as 
Rohrabacher, U.S. congressman of the late 20th Century, is concerned, even the 
fabulous animal paintings on the walls of the Lascaux caves should never have 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
What "frivolity" compelled those first artists to paint while "decent" men 
hunted and fought wars? 
</P>
<P>
Let us all take a stand against these latter day "Savonarolas" who would use 
the "indecent art" issue as a vehicle to quell all funding of the arts. Also, 
doesn't "indecent art" somehow evoke similar labels? Such as decadent, 
bourgeois and unnatural art, used by Communist and Nazi censors? Oh, woe to us 
all! and who will be the judge?

SHELDON, DANNEMEYER AND GAY PRIDE FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am appalled at the usage of AIDS as a tool to communicate a bigoted, 
closed-minded opinion. The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon and his Traditional Values 
Coalition have gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
One of the picket signs on display read "AIDS Kills!" This is true, meaning 
that we should all be afraid of the Traditional Values Coalition. At least AIDS 
doesn't discriminate against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Among other tactics used by the Traditional Values Coalition: a 15-year-old 
cheerleader chanting bad AIDS jokes. Another picket sign read, "God Is Judge." 
If this is true, then who are they to appoint themselves as prosecutor 
(persecutor?) and jury? 
</P>
<P>
They even went so far as to mail explicit gay magazines to Santa Ana City 
Council members' homes. Isn't using the mail to distribute pornography a 
felony, or does this law not apply if you are using the pornography to fan the 
bonfires of a right-wing, religious hate group? If they aren't sent to jail on 
felony charges, then Sheldon's gang of Bible-thumpers should be sent to jail 
for arrogance and stupidity.

A TAX INCREASE FOR ORANGE COUNTY'S SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although I was not one of those polled, I, too, would support a tax hike that 
would directly benefit the schools here in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Since the passage of Proposition 13, I have watched the school districts 
struggle to provide outstanding instruction with less than adequate funds. 
Throughout the county, dedicated teachers continue to find creative ways to 
supply a wide variety of enrichment activities in and out of the classroom that 
the government simply cannot fund. 
</P>
<P>
A tax increase was opposed by a majority of residents 55 and older, with a 
64-year-old woman acting as (spokeswoman): "Most kids, when they get through 
school, can't even spell or add or write their names." 
</P>
<P>
This quote simply isn't supported by the facts. For the past several years, 
Orange County achievement tests scores have been slowly and steadily climbing, 
despite the increasing influx of non-English-speaking students. To bring 
children with few or no communication skills in their native language to 
acceptable levels of competence in written and spoken English is an outstanding 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
I would suggest anyone who "can't see spending more money on something that's 
not working," to sign up for a few of the classes our high school students are 
required to take for graduation. The academic challenge might prove 
stimulating. 
</P>
<P>
There is still plenty of room for improvement in education. However, if we are 
to keep well-qualified instructors in the classroom, we need to provide the 
worthwhile salaries and facilities that will enable them to do their jobs.

UCLA CATCHES SAN DIEGO STATE; 
</P>
<P>
BRUINS WIN, 28-25, ON SNEAK BY JOHNSON WITH 2:39 LEFT

<TEXT>
<P>
No. 20 UCLA needed a one-yard touchdown sneak by quarterback Bret Johnson with 
2:39 to play to score a 28-25 comeback victory over winless San Diego State 
Saturday night before 31,639 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's touchdown came a little more than four minutes after running back 
Darrin Wagner's 31-yard touchdown run had given the Aztecs (0-2) a 25-21 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown capped a nine-play, 57-yard drive that allowed the Bruins (1-1) 
to avoid their first loss ever in 13 games against the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of these kids," said SDSU Coach Al Luginbill, "and tonight everybody 
saw why. I see it in practice every day." 
</P>
<P>
Said SDSU quarterback Dan McGwire: "This offense can explode any time. It's 
volatile, especially the running game. We just fell short tonight. These games 
are hard; we're trying to keep our heads high." 
</P>
<P>
If there were any question that this would be some UCLA team other the one that 
lost to Tennessee, 24-6, in its opener the week before, it was dispelled early. 
</P>
<P>
All it took was a 73-yard run for a touchdown on a fake punt by senior nickel 
back John Wesselman to give the Aztecs a 7-0 lead with 3:49 left in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since this 67-year-old series was resumed in 1984 that 
San Diego State led in a game. The run was a warning that this game would be 
closer to UCLA 18-15 victory in 1984 than than the lopsided UCLA victories of 
the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
In the early going, the Bruins looked like anything but the top 20 team they 
are. They struggled to take a 14-10 halftime lead against a San Diego State 
team that had lost at Air Force Sept. 2 in its opener, 52-36. 
</P>
<P>
This also was the same Aztec program, though not the same team, that the Bruins 
had beaten the past three years by a combined score of 151-34. But regardless 
of improvement the Aztecs showed this time, the Bruins demonstrated many of 
their problems were their own doing. 
</P>
<P>
They again had difficulty defensively. They yielded 234 yards to the Aztecs in 
the first half; that was as many as the Bruins gave up to the Aztecs in their 
entire 59-6 victory in the Rose Bowl last year. And unlike past years when they 
were able to physically overmatch the Aztecs on both lines, San Diego State 
held its own up front. 
</P>
<P>
This appeared to be a much more brazen Aztec team than the Bruins were used to 
playing. Luginbill, was not afraid to gamble on big plays. 
</P>
<P>
He not only successfully used the fake punt, but risked a throw to the goal 
line late in second quarter on fourth-and-one from the UCLA 21. That pass by 
McGwire was intercepted by strong safety Matt Darby, but the message again was 
clear: This San Diego State team was not about to roll over. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins appeared ready to exert their traditional dominance of the Aztecs 
midway through the first quarter, starting a long drive that took them deep 
into San Diego State territory. But the drive ended abruptly with an 
interception and the Aztecs then turned to a touch of trickery. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA had moved to the Aztec 27 when Johnson attempted to complete a pass to 
tailback Brian Brown. But the ball was high and Brown could only tip it over 
his head and into the hands of San Diego State cornerback Clark Moses at the 
Aztec 17. 
</P>
<P>
Moses returned the ball five yards to the San Diego State 22. The drive stalled 
after three plays netted five yards, and the Aztecs went into punt formation. 
But instead of snapping the ball to punter Joe Santos, the ball was hiked to 
the short man, Wesselman. 
</P>
<P>
Wesselman, a senior from West Torrance High School, took the snap and dashed 
around the right side untouched. He eluded Shawn Wills, who had been set up as 
the return man, at the UCLA 45 and then outraced strong safety Mark McGill to 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked very hard on our kicking game," Luginbill said. "I told me club if 
we work on something very hard, we're going to use it in the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins wasted little time responding. They went on their longest drive, 
moving 79 yards in eight plays to tie the score at 7-7 on a 38-yard pass to 
flanker Scott Miller from Johnson with 12 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins went ahead 14-7 on their next possession. This time they went 71 
yards in 10 plays, the drive ending on a one-yard dive by freshman tailback 
Kevin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown drive put the Bruins ahead for the first time, but it had a 
price. Wills sprained his right ankle midway through the drive and did not 
return. Wills, who led the Bruins with 62 yards on 11 carries against 
Tennessee, had 29 yards on four carries against the Aztecs. His departure left 
Brown to carry the rushing load. 
</P>
<P>
Brown finished with 99 yards on 32 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs tried their second gamble on the next series. Faced with a 
fourth-and-one at the UCLA 21, the Aztecs not only elected to go for a first 
down rather than attempt would have been a 38-yard field goal but tried to gain 
the yardage through the air. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire attempted a pass to Jimmy Raye near the left front of the end zone, but 
Darby stepped in to make the interception. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bruins could do nothing with that bit of good fortune and the Aztecs 
took over at their 40 with 2:56 left in the half after a 52-yard punt by Kirk 
Maggio. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs went into their two-minute offense, driving for a fourth-and-one to 
the UCLA 9 with 10 seconds left. The Aztecs used their last time out to set up 
for a 26-yard field goal by Andy Trakas that cut the lead to 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had a chance in the third quarter to again go ahead by a touchdown, 
but Alfredo Velasco's 42-yard field goal attempt with 10:54 left was low and 
was blocked at the line by lineman Brad Burton. 
</P>
<P>
The third quarter ended scoreless, but that was only because the clock ran out 
two plays before the Bruins could add their third touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But like most else in the game, this did not come easily either for the Bruins. 
They needed two tries from less than a yard away before Williams finally snuck 
around the left side for his second touchdown and a 21-10 lead at 14:18. 
</P>
<P>
The first attempt ended with fullback Maury Toy being stopped as he attempted 
to crash the middle of the line. The second was successful but only because of 
the persistence of Williams, a freshman from Spring, Tex. He tried the left 
side, and when he found no opening, he kept sliding farther outside, eventually 
getting by two Aztec defenders and into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
But the Aztecs would not go away. They drove 74 yards on 10 plays on their next 
possession, which ended when Wagner slipped around the right side for a 
one-yard touchdown run with 11:24 to play. 
</P>
<P>
The gambler in Luginbill came out again on the conversion, but not before a 
momentary mix-up. Luginbill apparently wanted to try for a two-point conversion 
but before the team could get the word, Trakas attempted a conversion kick 
while McGwire was running on the field and the Aztecs were called for too many 
men on the field. But the penalty turned out to be the break the Aztecs needed. 
</P>
<P>
That gave them a second chance to get McGwire on the field. And this time he 
completed the two-point pass to Raye in the end zone. That brought the Aztecs 
to within 21-18 where a field goal could have given them a tie and a moral 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
But safety Morey Paul and Wagner would combine a few minutes later to give them 
more than that. 
</P>
<P>
On the third play after Wagner's touchdown, Paul intercepted the second Johnson 
pass of the game at the San Diego State 47. 
</P>
<P>
At first, it appeared as if the Aztecs would not benefit as a holding penalty 
and sack forced them into a third-and-31 at their 27. But McGwire connected on 
a 30-yard pass to wide receiver Dennis Arey on third down. And then another 
Aztec gamble worked when McGwire snuck over for a first down on a 
fourth-and-one to keep the drived alive at the UCLA 42. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Wagner dashed down the right side for his second touchdown 
-- a 31-yarder that included a move that left free safety Eric Turner on his 
rump. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Aztecs a 25-21 lead and forced the final Bruin rally.

CHARGERS, OILERS ARE IN A SIMILAR SPOT; 
</P>
<P>
BOTH TEAMS LOOK TO REBOUND FROM OPENING ROUTS

<TEXT>
<P>
After all was said, unsaid and done last week in Los Angeles, where the 
Chargers lost their season opener to the Raiders, 40-14, they didn't figure 
soon to find an opponent more desperate than themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Hello Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger defense allowed 418 yards (third most in the league) against the 
Raiders. And afterward, Coach Dan Henning gave his team a public relations 
hotfoot when he failed to fully explain why he yanked his starting quarterback, 
Jim McMahon, in the third period with his team still in the game. 
</P>
<P>
But the Oilers, who visit San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium today, drove 61 yards 
on their opening possession for a 7-0 lead and gained just 43 yards the rest of 
the afternoon against Minnesota, which beat them, 38-7. 
</P>
<P>
Only one NFL team, Pittsburgh, gained fewer yards than Houston last Sunday. 
Only one NFL starting quarterback, Pittsburgh's Bubby Brister (16.3), has a 
lower passer rating after one game than the Oilers' Warren Moon (29.0). 
Houston's offensive line, which gave up 24 sacks all last year, allowed the 
Vikings to sack Moon seven times. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody could be worse off than we are," said Coach Jerry 
Glanville, whose team has lost seven of its past 11 road games. "If they were 
going to give out prizes, that would be about the only one we'd get." 
</P>
<P>
How bad was it? Glanville was still talking about the Minnesota loss three days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"We got whipped," Glanville said at mid-week. "No excuses, no alibis. They 
lined up and just whipped us. No trickery. No fooling. No exotic game plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody did any good for us. The equipment man wasn't any good. The radio show 
stunk. The public relations guy has never been worth a damn." 
</P>
<P>
You get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
But Glanville didn't stop there. He questioned Henning's policy of closing 
practices to the media. And he criticized Henning for not granting him an 
interview when Henning took over as head coach in Atlanta in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Henning claimed he did interview Glanville and then rightfully wondered how two 
coaches so famished for a victory had gotten caught up in a hissing contest six 
years later about something now so insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
"By all yardsticks, Houston is an excellent football team," Henning said, 
changing the subject. "It's certainly a team that felt it would play better 
than it did last week." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Houston's problem was its opponent. Minnesota is a strong candidate to 
represent the NFC in Super Bowl XXIV. Part of the problem was the Oilers' loss 
of several important players to Plan B free agency this year. One, defensive 
end Robert Banks, is playing a major role on the defense of Cleveland, a 
division rival. 
</P>
<P>
And part of the problem was coaching. "Minnesota picked up every one of the 
Oilers' blitzes," Charger guard David Richards said after studying the film. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a little embarrassed," said Moon, who completed just eight of 20 passes 
for 69 yards. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Moon says part of the problem is the fact that the Oilers, who 
won nine games in 1987 and 10 last year, can't sneak up on anybody any more. 
They have qualified for the playoffs two consecutive years. "We're not looked 
upon as a mediocre team on anybody's schedule any more," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, they're looked upon as one of the dirtiest teams in the league. And 
we're not talking topsoil here. We're talking late hits and penalties, and 
we're talking trash. Houston was the league's most penalized team in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"That means there are going to be some things that you can't afford to lose 
your composure on," Henning says. And he has told his players as much. "You 
can't afford to strike back because generally the second guy gets nailed." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, 6-10 last year, are still looked upon as a mediocre team at best 
on most team's schedules. Their hopes against Houston rest on quarterback Jim 
McMahon's ribs and much-needed improvement on special teams, where they have a 
different punter, kicker, snapper and coach from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Raiders, McMahon bruised his ribs in the third period after 
completing only seven of 18 passes for 91 yards. The pain hindered his ability 
to raise his voice. And he wasn't able to bark out signals comfortably until 
Thursday. Henning says he will start against the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' special teams under new Coach Joe Madden buried themselves under 
an avalanche of errors against the Raiders. Madden promises "overall" 
improvement. But the only noticeable change during practice this week was the 
substitution of newly signed Darryl Usher on kickoff returns in place of rookie 
Victor Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
Houston has a busload of excellent running backs including Allen Pinkett, 
Alonzo Highsmith, Lorenzo White and Mike Rozier, who signed late and didn't 
play against Minnesota. But they also run a four-receiver set that puts extra 
demands on the secondary. The Chargers hope to counter in those situations with 
Johnny Thomas, who replaces the waived Leonard Coleman in six-back coverage. 
</P>
<P>
If Thomas plays well, look for him to eventually replace Sam Seale at starting 
right cornerback. Seale is the Chargers' fastest defensive back but erratic, 
and Raider Willie Gault burned him repeatedly last week. 
</P>
<P>
But the best way to play pass defense is with a strong pass rush. And that is 
especially true against Moon, who is mobile and strong-armed. 
</P>
<P>
"The days he has been hot, he would throw a scare into anybody," Henning says. 
"In order to keep him from being hot, you have to get penetration and you have 
to keep him off balance. You can't let him get his feet set."

OLD LIONS RECALL THE PASSING YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
IN 1949, THREE YEARS BEFORE FOOTBALL ENDED FOR GOOD AT LOYOLA, COACHES JORDAN 
OLIVAR AND JERRY NERI ARRIVED TO LEAD THE SCHOOL TO ITS LAST GRIDIRON GLORY 
WITH AN AERIAL ATTACK AHEAD OF THE TIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Forty years ago, a pair of young football coaches from the East Coast were 
preparing for their first season in the West. Their aim was to restore 
respectability to the Loyola University football program. 
</P>
<P>
By 1949, the new Loyola head coach, Jordan Olivar, and his top assistant, Jerry 
Neri, both in their mid-30s, had enjoyed great success in leading their alma 
mater, Villanova College of Philadelphia, to a 33-20-2 record during the 
previous six years. 
</P>
<P>
They were joined at Loyola by another former Villanova assistant coach, John 
McKenna, and by 1938 Loyola grad Harry Acquarelli, who also coached the Lions' 
freshman squad. 
</P>
<P>
Olivar and Neri were the perfect pair to lead their type of team, according to 
retired journalist Chuck Johnson, for 40 years the sports editor of Tidings, a 
weekly newspaper serving the Catholic community in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Jordan was a very intellectual type of coach," Johnson said. "Jerry was the 
disciplinarian. If any player needed to be chewed out, Jerry did it." 
</P>
<P>
They also brought Loyola a simplified T-formation passing offense that was 
revolutionary for that time in football. 
</P>
<P>
Olivar and Neri were fresh from having led Villanova to a 27-7 victory over the 
powerful University of Nevada (now Nevada-Reno) in the Harbor Bowl in San Diego 
on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was during a stopover at Los Angeles' Union Station, while taking 
the train from San Diego back to Philadelphia, that a member of the team read 
that Loyola was conducting a search for a new head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Jokingly the remark was made, 'Hey, there's a job we ought to apply for,' " 
said Olivar. "We all loved the West Coast. We had an hour's wait at Union 
Station on our way back to the East, so I thought, 'What the hell' -- it cost a 
nickel in those days to call." 
</P>
<P>
Timing, at that moment, was on their side. "The gal who answered the phone 
said, 'The athletic department is closed today -- it's Sunday.' That could have 
ended that, but then she had a second thought and said, 'Oh, maybe Father (John 
F.) Connolly is around. He's the chairman of the athletic board.' I said, 
'That's the man I want to talk to,' " Olivar said. 
</P>
<P>
"She called his room (on campus) and he was in. We talked and I told him why I 
was calling. He starts laughing like hell. I asked him what was so funny. He 
said, 'Don't you know who the leading contender is for this position? It's Joe 
Sheeketski (coach of the Nevada team that Villanova had just trounced). So I 
laughed. I said, 'Father, would that really hurt my chances?' He said, 'I've 
got to meet you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Olivar, who was set to send his team on to Philadelphia while he traveled north 
to San Francisco to attend a football coaches' convention, was urged by the 
Loyola priest to alter his plans. Before going on to San Francisco, he met with 
one influential member of the search committee, Ted Von Der Ahe, who ran Vons 
supermarkets at the time and who was impressed with the Villanova coach. The 
committee asked Olivar to return after the convention. 
</P>
<P>
"On Jan. 10, I flew back to L.A. and met with the committee on campus in St. 
Robert's Hall. It had snowed on the flats of L.A. -- for the first time in 69 
years -- and I just said, 'You sure know how to make a guy from the East feel 
right at home.' They laughed and that sort of broke the tension. After the 
interview, I flew back to Philadelphia, and the next day they called to tell me 
the job was mine. 
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to my wife for about five minutes and called them back and said, 'OK.' 
Jerry (Neri) was out scouting someplace. I finally located him and said, 
'Jerry, stop recruiting. We've got a new job.' He just said, 'OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
So both men moved their lives, families and futures across the country to a 
place where they'd have a significant -- albeit relatively brief -- impact. And 
although they would later move across the country again to coach at Yale 
University, they have since kept their homes in the South Bay, Olivar in 
Inglewood with his wife of 53 years, Stella, and Neri in Westchester with his 
wife of 48 years, Teresa. 
</P>
<P>
Although 38 years have passed since big-time football was dropped at Loyola, 
the two coaches and many of their players remain close. The team members had 
their most recent reunion in July, and they get together at least once a year. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the former players were also in attendance earlier this year when Neri 
was inducted into the Loyola Marymount University Athletic Hall of Fame, in the 
hall's fourth year of existence. He joined Olivar, who was inducted in the 
hall's charter year of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Neri, 74, is a special-assignment scout for the National Football League's 
Detroit Lions, which he joined as director of player personnel in 1969. He 
began his 27-year association with the NFL when he and Olivar decided to leave 
Yale after the 1962 season. 
</P>
<P>
The energetic Neri -- who resembles Pat O'Brien, the actor who portrayed Notre 
Dame's legendary football coach, Knute Rockne -- looks and acts much younger 
than his age. 
</P>
<P>
So does Olivar, soon to turn 76, who last coached as a volunteer in the spring 
of 1963 for UCLA, which considered him the foremost expert on the T-formation. 
Although Olivar has been away from the coaching ranks since then, he keeps a 
full business schedule as president of a pension administration firm in Beverly 
Hills that grew from his work as an insurance sales manager that began while he 
was still coaching. 
</P>
<P>
During their coaching days at Yale, Olivar and Neri continued to live in 
Southern California for nine months of the year, living in Connecticut only 
during the football season. 
</P>
<P>
Growing weary of the East Coast winters and the coaching commute for those 11 
years, they chose to become full-time Los Angeles residents again, just as they 
had in '49. 
</P>
<P>
In that year, Olivar and Neri took over the reins of a Loyola football program 
that enjoyed a fair-sized following in Southern California. College sports 
attracted fervent interest because there was only one major pro team in the 
area, the Los Angeles Rams. 
</P>
<P>
USC and UCLA were the local kingpins of college sports, but there was plenty of 
room for schools such as Loyola, in Westchester, and Pepperdine, then in 
central Los Angeles, to earn attention from the media and the public. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions had been coached the previous two years by Bill Sargent, winning only 
three games in each. The team had been playing its home games in 18,500-seat 
Gilmore Stadium, demolished in 1950 to accommodate CBS' Television City 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
While Loyola had had moments of football glory against USC, UCLA and others in 
games at the Memorial Coliseum, the Catholic school, like Pepperdine, had 
subsided to second-class status. By the time Olivar and Neri came to 
Westchester, USC and UCLA refused to play Loyola on the gridiron. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came out here to coach Loyola, I called Jeff Cravath, the coach at 
USC," Olivar remembers. "I said, 'Jeff, how about scheduling us for a game?' He 
said 'Jordan, are you crazy? If we book Loyola, the alumni would fire me!' I 
said, 'OK, how about playing us in a scrimmage game?' and he said, 'Not even 
that!' 
</P>
<P>
"The funny part was that if he had booked us, we would have beaten them the 
next year, because we had a good football team with (junior fullback George) 
Musacco and all of the guys," said Olivar, whose team had also benefitted from 
an outstanding recruiting effort by Sargent in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Then UCLA Athletic Director Wilbur Johns explained the interests of both the 
Trojan and Bruin athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
"He said there was no way that either UCLA or USC would ever play Loyola. He 
told me point blank: 'If we play you, you have a pretty good football team, and 
you would become a third recruiting power in this area. Right now we've got it 
all to ourselves. This area is UCLA and USC,' " Olivar said. 
</P>
<P>
Such responses did not deter the new Lion coaches from taking on a tough 
schedule and gaining notice. They had faced a similar problem coaching at 
Villanova from 1943 to 1948. 
</P>
<P>
"We had trouble getting games, but both Army and Navy played us," Neri 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were a big school that played us, there was a good chance you might get 
beat," Olivar said. "If you did beat us, so what? You beat a small school. So 
we had to play almost anybody we could." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the same kind of scheduling dilemma at Loyola, they still met a 
rugged list of opponents. Their first game wasn't encouraging, to say the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
The night of Sept. 23, 1949, saw the Lions playing offensive powerhouse College 
of the Pacific, led by quarterback and future NFL star Eddie LeBaron, at 
Gilmore Stadium. It was a rude awakening for Olivar, Neri and their new 
players. Pacific routed Loyola, 52-0. Neither the Loyola offense nor defense 
could muster anything. 
</P>
<P>
Olivar and Neri may have feared they'd be run off the campus and off the West 
Coast, but the school's moderator of athletics, Father Lorenzo M. Malone, told 
Olivar after the game that he could see improvement in the team's play from the 
previous season. Encouraged, Olivar and Neri struggled on with their young 
team, and lost their next game to the University of San Francisco, 27-12, in 
San Francisco's Kezar Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The tide turned dramatically the following week at Gilmore Stadium when the 
Lions blasted Fresno State, 52-13. After losing to St. Mary's and Santa Clara, 
the Lions won their last five games of the '49 season. The end result was the 
Lions' winningest season in 13 years, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Talented young Lion players like sophomore quarterback Don Klosterman, junior 
halfbacks Skip Giancanelli and Neil Ferris, junior end Gene Brito and sophomore 
guard Maury Nipp matured and developed into stars during the course of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Olivar and Neri had proven their abilities to Loyola 
students, staff and alumni. 
</P>
<P>
It was Harry Stuhldreher, the Villanova coach when Olivar was a freshman in 
1934, and Stuhldreher's successor, Clipper Smith, who shaped the offensive 
philosophy employed by Olivar and Neri when they became coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Stuhldreher first came to prominence as the quarterback of Notre Dame's 
legendary "Four Horsemen" in the early 1920s under Rockne. When Neri, who came 
to Villanova two years after Olivar in 1936, arrived at the school, Smith was 
the head coach. But it was Stuhldreher who hooked Olivar on coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while he would, as a lot of coaches would do, take a couple of 
players to a restaurant for a decent meal, and I listened to him," Olivar said. 
"I listened to him talk at banquets. His behavior on the field didn't convince 
me to become a coach. His behavior in the banquet halls did. 
</P>
<P>
"The way he was speaking, he had that Rockne influence and that's the way he 
spoke -- very inspiring. When he gave one of his pep talks, you wanted to knock 
the (locker-room) door down if they didn't open it quickly enough. That was so 
you could get out there to engage the enemy. He had us scared stiff every game, 
and he kept repeating himself. We never caught on (to the fact Stuhldreher's 
talks were repeats). I never realized it till years later." 
</P>
<P>
Smith succeeded Stuhldreher in 1936. He was an innovative offensive strategist 
for that era, according to Neri and Olivar. 
</P>
<P>
"Clipper Smith was very ahead of his time with the throwing game," Neri said. 
"At the time he (Smith) played, it was nothing to throw the ball 18 times a 
game. Heretofore, had they thrown the ball more than five times a game, it was 
a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Former NFL and college coach Don Coryell had the reputation of promoting the 
pass offense, dubbed "Air Coryell." Olivar and Neri -- the backfield coach for 
all the teams they coached together -- could have earned a similar nickname in 
the mid-1940s when they made their Villanova offense heavily pass-dependent 
while their contemporaries were sticking to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Being brought up with the offense of Clipper Smith, we were indoctrinated in 
the throwing game," Neri explained. "We used to see the pros on Sunday a lot. 
We were both believers in throwing the ball and we came up with our own pass 
offense. And it worked out very well for us when we put it in. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very simple offense, to the extent that I often wonder why some of 
the pro teams don't use it. What they use -- it sometimes looks like they're 
reciting a sonnet when they call the damn play. I remember (Rams and Redskins 
coach) George Allen saying that he could tell when it's going to be a forward 
pass by the amount of time it takes in a huddle telling each man what to do. We 
simplified that. 
</P>
<P>
"In our system, when we would call a play, (we) would only tell the receiver 
what to do. Everyone else knew what to do because of the type of pass that was 
being thrown," Neri noted. 
</P>
<P>
Their system flourished with a great passer like Klosterman. Although 
Klosterman completed just 46% of his passes as a sophomore in in 1949, the 1950 
Loyola football media guide noted that his 96 completions in '49 led all 
passers on the West Coast. The Lions' ground game didn't suffer too much either 
that year as Musacco, a rugged 6-foot-2, 212-pound fullback dubbed "Socko," 
gained a team-leading 881 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Lions struggled early in that first season under Olivar and Neri, 
it was the 5-0 finish that was the true indicator of how the program had 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions gained some national attention in 1950, going undefeated through 
their first seven games and earning consideration for a bid to the Orange Bowl 
on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Furillo, then a young sportswriter covering the Loyola football beat for 
the Los Angeles Herald-Express, remembers that Loyola had nine players on that 
year's team who went on to play pro ball. "They easily had the best (college) 
team in L.A. at that time. Olivar was then one of the greatest coaches in the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola steamrollered most opponents (50-14 over Pepperdine, 48-0 over St. 
Mary's, 34-7 over Nevada, and 28-0 over Fresno State). Olivar's squad also got 
revenge against Pacific, 35-33. A narrow 28-26 defeat at the hands of 
arch-rival Santa Clara late in November -- played before some Orange Bowl 
selection committee members -- probably killed Loyola's chance to play in the 
prestigious bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' disappointment from the loss was neutralized a bit by a dramatic 
40-28 come-from-behind victory over another arch-rival, San Francisco, in the 
season finale. 
</P>
<P>
For the season the Lions ranked first on the West Coast and fifth in the nation 
in total offense (420 yards per game), second on the coast and fourth in the 
nation in pass offense (186 yards per game and 20 touchdowns thrown, second on 
the coast and 10th nationally in rushing defense (106 yards a game), and second 
on the coast and 17th in the nation in total defense (217 yards a game). 
</P>
<P>
Klosterman, as a junior, ranked second on the coast and fifth in the nation in 
passing, as he completed 54.6% of his passes for 1,582 yards and 19 touchdowns. 
He also was first on the coast and ninth nationally in points scored after 
touchdowns, completing 35 of 42 extra-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very fortunate to have played under their leadership and in their 
system," said Klosterman, who went on to serve as general manager of the 
Baltimore Colts and the Los Angeles Rams after his playing career ended. "We 
(Loyola) were doing things that no one else was doing at that time. We were the 
forerunners of the passing game used today." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' top receiver in 1950 was 6-2 junior Fred Snyder, whose nine 
touchdown catches ranked him second in the nation in that category and whose 36 
total receptions for 596 yards ranked him second on the coast and ninth 
nationally. Musacco again anchored the running game, rushing for 866 yards, an 
average of 4.6 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
While Loyola may have missed that Orange Bowl game, little more than nine 
months later, Olivar had his team playing the University of Florida in the Rose 
Bowl, although not on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
After Gilmore Stadium was leveled in 1950, the Lions, buoyed by that season's 
success and the underwriting of opponent guarantees by Chevrolet, moved their 
home football games to the 100,000-seat stadium in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolet paid the guarantees to the visitors while commercially sponsoring 
each of the home games for telecast in Southern California on KNBH-TV, Channel 
4 (now KNBC-TV). Thus there was no need for fans to drive across town to watch 
the Lions' exciting offense, and the team played in front of a relative handful 
of fans. An estimated 6,000 in the Rose Bowl, plus an unknown number of TV 
viewers, watched Loyola fall to Florida, 40-7. 
</P>
<P>
After a disappointing '51 season that saw the Lions slip to 3-6 with victories 
over only San Jose State (13-12), Pepperdine (46-7) and Hardin-Simmons (14-13), 
Loyola dropped the football program. 
</P>
<P>
With Chevrolet's financial backing apparently no longer available, the program 
was no longer viewed as financially viable. Although the finger of blame was 
pointed in many directions, it apparently was the Jesuit hierarchy that oversaw 
the schools that dropped football not only at Loyola but also at the University 
of San Francisco, whose powerful team went undefeated in '51. Within a few 
years, Santa Clara's program was dropped as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Although he got blamed by everyone, it was not Father (Loyola President 
Charles S.) Casassa's decision," Olivar said. "The provincial of the diocese 
just decided that it was not profitable to play football at Loyola and USF. It 
was a financial thing. Loyola was fair enough. They gave us a year's pay." 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Loyola administration) were great," Neri remembers. 
</P>
<P>
"All the Jesuit schools throughout the United States (dropped football), except 
for Boston College. Georgetown gave it up, Detroit gave it up, Marquette gave 
it up. Santa Clara gave it up a year after Loyola." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight years ago, Olivar and Neri were not ready to give up their 
coaching careers, and they found no trouble resuming them again after another 
transcontinental move. 
</P>
<P>
Olivar went to the Ivy League as head coach at Yale the next season. Neri, 
after a short stint with the Washington Redskins, rejoined his longtime friend 
and coaching partner at Yale in time for the '52 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
They remained there through the 1962 season, leading Yale to a 61-32-6 record 
through 11 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The names of Jordan Olivar and Jerry Neri may not be as familiar to today's 
fans as Knute Rockne's, for their tenure in college coaching was relatively 
brief. But their influence on the passing game had a lot do to with shaping the 
game of football as it is played today.

CAL LUTHERAN FALLS APART LATE, 26-10; 
</P>
<P>
KINGSMEN TRAIL BY TWO IN FOURTH QUARTER BUT ST. MARY'S PULLS AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
While most of the St. Mary's players gathered in the middle of the field, 
celebrating a 26-10 victory over Cal Lutheran, another handful of players stood 
anxiously outside the Gaels' locker room and watched quarterback Tim Rosenkranz 
being strapped onto a stretcher and loaded into a waiting ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
It might have been a Pyrrhic victory for St. Mary's (2-1). Rosenkranz, the 
active career passing-yardage leader in Division II, left the game midway 
through the second quarter because of a back injury with the Gaels leading, 
6-3. The injury was diagnosed as a back strain and Rosenkranz was later 
released from the hospital. His playing status is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenkranz's replacement, freshman Kevin Lemmo, had never thrown a pass in 
collegiate football but threw for 111 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The first pass the left-hander threw kind of surprised everybody," Cal 
Lutheran Coach Bob Shoup said of Lemmo's initial effort, a 10-yard completion 
to wide receiver Lee Dongallo. "We didn't know he was left-handed. That's 
something we hadn't practiced on. We made some mistakes in coverage." 
</P>
<P>
Lemmo didn't show quite the elan of Rosenkranz, who completed 12 of 14 passes. 
With St. Mary's leading, 6-3, in the third quarter, Lemmo fumbled on a blitz 
and the ball popped out of his hands to Cal Lutheran linebacker Alonzo 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Williams galloped 60 yards for a touchdown, but Cal Lutheran (0-2) snatched 
defeat from the jaws of victory with a defensive-holding penalty that not only 
nullified the play but awarded St. Mary's 10 yards. The Gaels scored three 
plays later. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the big play," Shoup said. "With it, we're going with momentum into the 
fourth quarter and a lead, and I think we would have blown the ballgame open. 
That's about as dramatic a turnaround as you can get." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran closed the gap with five minutes to play. Quarterback Dan 
Nagelmann rolled right and found fullback Dan Smeester with a two-yard 
touchdown pass. Trailing only 12-10, the Kingsmen stiffened on defense, and the 
offense attempted to mount a game-winning drive with 4:25 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play, however, Nagelmann overthrew tight end David Deisinger over 
the middle, and defensive back Miles Freeman intercepted, returning the ball to 
the Cal Lutheran seven. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of trying to loft it, I just zipped it," said Nagelmann, making his 
first start for Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaels scored three plays later. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to learn to straighten it up when they get that kind of break," 
said linebacker Scott Schultz, who led the Kingsmen with 12 tackles. "We still 
could have won." 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's scored its final touchdown after Cal Lutheran reserve quarterback 
Tim Zeddies fumbled at his 30. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Jeff Lapinski shredded the St. Mary's defense with 71 first-half 
yards but suffered a slight concussion and rushed only twice in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Henderson then picked up the load, gaining 60 yards in 12 second-half 
carries, but, despite netting 140 yards with a fairly proficient rushing 
attack, Cal Lutheran couldn't put points on the board. Three lost fumbles, one 
interception and an anemic 0 for 6 on third-down conversion attempts, kept the 
Kingsmen stymied. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get off scoring one touchdown a game if we're going to win 
against this level of competition," Shoup said. "We still play a little 
tentative on offense, like we're almost there." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Bobby Crume led the St. Mary's defense with 12 tackles and he had 
two fumble recoveries and a sack.

WEEMS ERA AT HARBOR OPENS WITH 26-6 WIN

VICTORVILLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harbor College opened its football season with an impressive 26-6 victory over 
Victor Valley in Coach Don Weems' debut. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks, starting a mostly freshman lineup, took a 7-0 first-quarter lead 
when Casey Causey returned an interception 18 yards for the score. 
</P>
<P>
The run-oriented Harbor offense, efficiently guided by quarterback Christian 
Capper, got untracked in the second quarter. Bill Harris, who had a 101-yard 
kickoff return nullified by a penalty, capped a drive with a six-yard scoring 
run. Later in the quarter, Camron Pitcher broke away on a 40-yard scoring run. 
With kicker Jose Rocha adding two points-after, Harbor took a 20-0 lead at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor built its advantage to 26-0 in the fourth quarter on a 10-yard run by 
Phillip Robbins before Victor Valley (1-1) finally got on the scoreboard. 
Kicking with a brisk wind, the home team's Kevin Bryant booted a pair of 
56-yard field goals for all the points. 
</P>
<P>
The victory matched Harbor's total for last year and came in the school's only 
nonconference game. The Seahawks open Western States Conference play Saturday 
at Santa Monica College, where Weems previously coached. 
</P>
<P>
College action Saturday: At Portland, Ore., before a crowd of 1,157, the 
second-ranked University of Portland defeated Loyola Marymount, 4-1, in a West 
Coast Conference soccer game. The Lions, 1-5 overall and 0-2 in the WCC, were 
trailing 2-0 at halftime but pulled to within 2-1 on Jan Klein's unassisted 
goal at 49 minutes. However, Portland answered with a goal at 55:40 and scored 
again later. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions managed only five shots on goal, while Portland had 28. However, 
Loyola goalie Alex Poli recorded six saves to keep the game close. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola plays a nonconference game today at Oregon State before returning to Los 
Angeles.

ST. GENEVIEVE KEEPS REINS ON N. HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A joyous locker-room scene was rather rare last season as St. Genevieve High 
struggled to a 1-8 record and a last-place finish in the San Fernando Valley 
League. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a different story this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Ya gotta love it!" could be heard ringing out after the Valiants defeated 
North Hollywood, 7-0, on Saturday night at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fitting exclamation. First-year St. Genevieve Coach Mark Lovett has 
guided his team to a 2-0 start, quite a contrast to the misery of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Lovett's charges shut down the Huskies' offense, limiting it to 146 total 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very well-coached and aggressive defensively," North Hollywood Coach 
Fred Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
The Valiants, who last week allowed only 15 total yards in a 9-7 win over 
Murphy, have certainly shown a solid defense. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, it has been a different story. 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve took a 7-0 lead on its first possession when quarterback Dominic 
Muller hit tight end Mike Hoffmann with a 74-yard touchdown pass. But the 
Valiants gained only 115 yards the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get the offense rolling," Lovett said. "I'm an offensive coach. 
It can't go on like this." 
</P>
<P>
About the only highlight for North Hollywood was the play of tailback Mike 
Lewis, who gained 115 yards in 28 carries. 
</P>
<P>
One example of the difference between the teams' play occurred on the first 
play from scrimmage after Hoffmann's touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis took the handoff and rambled 55 yards for an apparent score, but the 
Huskies were called for illegal procedure and the play was nullified. 
</P>
<P>
The game marked another early season match-up between City and Southern section 
teams and, as with other City teams, North Hollywood found itself hurt by a 
late start. North Hollywood was playing its first game of the season and began 
practice two weeks later then its Southern Section opponent. 
</P>
<P>
With a limited staff and practice time, the Huskies entered the game with only 
three offensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
Two involved Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
The only variation Grimes used came with 6:18 left and North Hollywood facing a 
fourth and six on the Valiant 25. Quarterback Greg Roth pitched to Lewis, who 
immediately looked for a streaking Krigor Kerkonian heading toward the right 
corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' pass was overthrown, however, and St. Genevieve regained possession.

PLAY OF SPECIAL TEAMS COSTS VALLEY DEARLY IN 20-16 LOSS TO MT. SAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One thing is for sure: The Valley College football team will be spending extra 
practice time this week on kickoff returns. 
</P>
<P>
Two crucial plays in a 20-16 loss to Mt. San Antonio College on Saturday night 
made that much a certainty. They were two plays that might have been the 
difference between losing and winning the nonconference opener. 
</P>
<P>
Valley led, 10-6, at halftime but on the kickoff to begin the third quarter, 
Eric Barber was stripped of the ball by Mt. SAC's Tahrell Miles at the Valley 
28. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Ron Robins scored his second touchdown of the game on a 
one-yard run to give Mt. SAC a lead it never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties' lead appeared to last all of 15 seconds on the game clock, but 
Lamark Allen's ensuing 96-yard kickoff return for a touchdown was nullified by 
a clipping penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a former Saugus High standout, took the ball at the four, broke several 
tackles at the Valley 30, then sprinted down the left sideline for the apparent 
go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"That fumble and that penalty. Those two things killed us," Valley Coach Chuck 
Ferrero said. "If we eliminate those, we win the game. It's a sick loss because 
we lost on the kicking game. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm proud of this team. They played their hearts out." 
</P>
<P>
Valley (6-4 last season) still had a chance to win in the final seconds, but a 
last-ditch bomb by Trendell Williams (12 of 28 for 239 yards, one touchdown, 
three interceptions) was intercepted by Leroy Johnson in the Mt. SAC end zone 
with 17 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 20-10, Valley narrowed the deficit to four points when Williams 
hooked up with Rodney Guy on an 86-yard touchdown play with 1:42 left. 
</P>
<P>
Guy caught the pass at midfield, cut inside defensive back Charlie Hudson and 
raced untouched into the end zone. The two-point conversion run failed. 
</P>
<P>
The Mt. SAC defense accounted for the Mounties' final touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Derek Dewitt batted a Williams pass, intercepted it, then rumbled 19 
yards into the end zone with 13:18 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Russell put in a stellar performance for Mt. SAC, rushing for 140 yards 
in 26 carries, but his fumble led to Valley's first score, a 23-yard Jim Harper 
field goal.

BRADLEY'S QUICK STRIKE IGNITES MOORPARK WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NICHOLS, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freddie Bradley must believe in making a good first impression. 
</P>
<P>
The freshman returned the opening kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown Saturday in 
Moorpark College's opener, much to the amazement of East Los Angeles Coach Al 
Padilla. 
</P>
<P>
"To start off the game like that is a real shock treatment," Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley made a lasting impression on Padilla by scoring his second touchdown on 
a 25-yard reception with 32 seconds left in the first quarter. Quarterback 
Jayson Merrill added three touchdown passes to lift the Raiders to a 31-7 
victory at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley jump-started Moorpark's offense by bursting through the middle on the 
opening kickoff. Fourteen minutes later, Merrill hit the running back with a 
scoring pass to give Moorpark a 14-0 lead at the end of the first quarter. All 
the scoring in the game came in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like that guy and when he returned that kickoff for a touchdown I 
liked him a lot more," Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner said. 
</P>
<P>
Bittner, who is known for his love of the running game, let Merrill pass 
against the Huskies and with good results: 12 completions in 20 attempts for 
201 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really concerned with our offensive line in the first half," Bittner 
said. "They did a lot of blitzes and stuff that pretty much forced us to pass, 
and we did not hesitate to go to the air. I have a lot of confidence in Merrill 
and we went up top right away." 
</P>
<P>
With Moorpark leading, 14-0, East L. A. tailback Adan Avina burst through the 
middle for a 44-yard touchdown run with 14:40 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing possession, the Raiders moved 73 yards in six plays to score 
their third touchdown. Wide receiver Rick Wright took Merrill's pass 62 yards 
for a touchdown. Sean Cheevers' point-after gave Moorpark a 21-7 lead with 
10:23 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark gained 343 yards in total offense. The Huskies (0-2), who gained 554 
total yards and rang up 39 points in an opening loss to Pierce last week, 
picked up 268 yards. Avina accounted for 147 yards in 21 carries.

PORTLAND ST. SHOWS CSUN SAME LOOK

Last year's NCAA Division II women's volleyball finalists met again Saturday 
night, but the rematch turned into a replay. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge, which was swept in three games last December by Portland 
State, gave a better account of itself this time but still went down in three 
consecutive games at the Cal State Northridge tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors, who in December failed to reach double figures in any game 
against Portland State, lost this time, 15-4, 16-14, 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough medicine to swallow, but we really need the medicine," Northridge 
Coach Walt Ker said. "I felt we competed pretty well in games two and three, 
but it came down to fundamental execution, and they did and we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors were never in the first game but took the early lead in game 
two and built their advantage to 14-12. But Northridge let three game points 
slip away and Portland State came back to win when Maria Rickman tipped the 
ball past Connie Noe at the net. 
</P>
<P>
It was Northridge making a comeback in game three. The Lady Matadors trailed 
from the outset but staved off six game points and rallied from a 14-10 deficit 
to tie the game, 14-14, when Jenny Norlin committed a net fault. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge couldn't sustain the momentum, however, and the Vikings won the game 
when CSUN's Alissa Evans sent a spike long -- one of a match-high 15 errors the 
senior hitter committed. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Dixon had 17 kills, Keira Middleton 11 and Evans 10 for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they were expecting us to come out that hard," Norlin said of 
the first game. She led Portland State with 17 kills. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Northridge defeated San Francisco State, 15-12, 15-9, 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Dixon had 15 kills against San Francisco State and Middleton added 11. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament title went to UC Riverside, which completed a clean sweep of the 
round-robin event Saturday by defeating North Dakota State, 15-9, 14-16, 15-11, 
15-5, and San Francisco State, 15-4, 15-5, 7-15, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
Portland State finished second and earlier Saturday defeated North Dakota 
State, 15-12, 15-4, 18-16.

WORDIN MAKES A CAREER MOVE -- STRAIGHT DOWNHILL

<P>
The thought of hurling himself and his bike off a cliff had never really 
appealed to John Wordin. Sane people can be like that. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the National Off-Road Bicycle Assn. Points Series Finals and World 
Mountain Bike Championships approached on consecutive weekends in September, 
the more intrigued he became. Road racing did not prepare him for this 
experience. Neither did several years of football at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the gnarliest thing you'll ever do on a bike," the West Hills resident 
said. "They carry people off on stretchers. There were a lot of guys coming 
down with mangled bikes." 
</P>
<P>
Wordin, a road racer by trade, was speaking of last weekend's kamikaze downhill 
at the World Mountain Bike Championships at Mammoth Lakes, where it is 
advisable to wear hockey goalie gear and check your trepidations at the door. 
Competitors push huge gears and reach speeds approaching 45 m. p. h. -- all 
while negotiating hairpin turns and hair-raising obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so different," Wordin said. "You get out of control a lot easier. It's 
not harder or easier, really, just different. Kind of like going from 
racquetball to tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Wordin dropped out of the race -- although he was 49th in the hill climb -- 
when he experienced mechanical difficulties, but he was 25th overall at the 
NORBA event in Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was his first mountain bike race. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the guys dropped out," Wordin said. "I think that's why I did so 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Add NORBA Championships: Chatsworth's John Tomac was ninth in the NORBA Points 
Series Finals Sept. 3 in Big Bear. Tomac, the defending champion, finished the 
30-mile cross-country race at Snow Summit Resort in 2 hours, 29 minutes, 41 
seconds, nearly seven minutes off the pace of winner Tim Gould of Great 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
In the final points standings Tomac, who spent much of the season concentrating 
on road races, was ninth with 65 points. Ned Overend had 119 points to win the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
The women's race champion was Sara Ballantyne, who also finished first in the 
overall points standings. 
</P>
<P>
Add Tomac: Considered the finest off-road cyclist in the world despite recent 
efforts to steer his career toward road races, Tomac won the kamikaze downhill 
en route to the overall title in the Mountain Bike World Championships last 
weekend in Mammoth Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac, the defending champion, finished six seconds ahead of the pack, covering 
the approximate four-mile descent in 5:30. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac was sixth in the cross-country event and fourth in the hill climb to hold 
off Sunnyvale's Don Myrah, who finished with 59 points -- four behind Tomac. 
</P>
<P>
Other area finishers included Canyon Country's Tom Rogers, who was third in the 
hill climb, 17th in the cross-country race, 21st in the downhill and ninth 
overall; and Palmdale's Wayne Crosdale, fifth in the downhill and 21st overall. 
Burbank's Bret Hill was 43rd in the hill climb and 50th in the cross-country 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, incidentally, is an original member of Team Ape, a Simi Valley team 
that, among other requirements, demands its members be at least 6-feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's standings, Simi Valley's Katie Beck was 19th overall in the 
expert class. 
</P>
<P>
Wild thing: The Wilderness Institute, a nonprofit organization based in 
Woodland Hills, is offering several classes for beginning cyclists over the 
next two months. 
</P>
<P>
The courses include bicycle maintenance, introduction to touring in Santa 
Barbara, mountain-bike maintenance and introduction to mountain biking in 
addition to tours of the Santa Ynez Valley and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Subaru series: David Brinton of North Hollywood and Team Crest was 13th in the 
most recent stop of the Subaru Cycling Series, held Sept. 10 in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Hegg of Montgomery/Avenir won the criterium. Hegg, a teammate of Van Nuys 
resident Thurlow Rogers, earned 35 points and moved to within 33 points of 
overall leader Tom Schuler.

THE GERMAN QUESTION: A GOING WEST, A WITHERING EAST AND A FAILING HEAD OF STATE

<TEXT>
<P>
Images on the evening news are startling. East Germans by the thousands stream 
into Austria with only perfunctory checks from amiable Hungarian border guards. 
Mostly young, many with children, they speedily cross the neutral country and 
are welcomed into West Germany as citizens come home. More wait in Hungary, 
preparing to take advantage of Budapest's opening of what was an impenetrable 
Iron Curtain. As the East German state hemorrhages, its seemingly leaderless 
government impotently fulminates, Moscow half-heartedly protests and observers 
wonder if the postwar European order is unraveling. What is going on? 
</P>
<P>
Long the East Bloc's economic showcase, the German Democratic Republic has 
joined the list of communist countries in turmoil, including China, the Soviet 
Union, Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia. East German leader Erich Honecker, now 
reportedly gravely ill, has proved unable to solve the worst crisis in his 
country since the 1961 building of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
For three decades, the Communists have striven to forge an East German identity 
and instill patriotism. Parades feature the flag and a martial anthem beginning 
with "Risen from ruins and turned to the future." Since the early 1970s, the 
country has broken out of its isolation and now maintains diplomatic relations 
around the world. Its athletes are at the pinnacle of international sports. In 
recent years, the government has stressed its German heritage, modifying its 
own ideological spin on history to identify with nationalist sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
Problems, however, have been building. Despite infusions of loans and favorable 
trade terms extended by the Federal Republic of Germany, East Germany's economy 
is stagnant. While Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev extols glasnost and 
perestroika, Poland elects a non-Communist government and Hungary embarks on a 
multiparty system. Honecker and his rigid colleagues steadfastly reject 
political or economic reform -- preferring instead to support the Chinese 
government's massacre in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 10 years ago, citizens' groups began forming, championing a variety 
of peace, ecological and human-rights causes. There may be 500 such groups in 
East Germany today, most existing under the umbrella of the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church. In general, these protesters are a "loyal socialist 
opposition" seeking to improve an imperfect socialist system, not to jettison 
it. The bulk of the East German people, however, seems to prefer the more 
radical solution -- for example, many voters in May's local elections crossed 
off the names of unopposed official candidates. 
</P>
<P>
What drives so many East Germans to abandon a homeland that provides a standard 
of living superior to that of other communist nations and equal to at least the 
poorer members of the European Community? Why leave the security of a 
guaranteed job for a competitive society with higher unemployment? For some, it 
is the lure of greater material rewards that capitalism bestows on success. 
East Berlin goods may outshine those in Bucharest or Warsaw, but they are no 
match for those of Bremen or Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with East German refugees reveal a deeper reason: the impossibility 
of fulfilling individual potential amid dreary communist orthodoxy. Ideology 
remains pervasive. Party rallies with compulsory attendance punctuate the 
calendar. At work and school, commitment to the communist system is noted in 
personnel records, and lack of enthusiasm often warrants a negative mark. 
Preference for university places is given to good pupils also deemed 
ideologically correct. Controls on artistic creativity have been loosened 
somewhat, but these gestures have not satisfied the critical public. 
</P>
<P>
Alienated East Germans have an alternative. Poles and Hungarians, with lower 
living standards, may travel to the West, but most return because emigration 
usually entails a change in nationality -- there is no "West Hungary" or "West 
Poland." But there is a West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Although more than 85% of East Germans receive TV programs from West Germany, 
first-hand knowledge was lacking until recently. Two years ago, as part of the 
warming between the two Germanys, and perhaps as a steam vent, East Germany 
began allowing thousands of working-age citizens to travel to the Federal 
Republic -- as long as spouses and children stayed behind. They saw prosperity 
of a different magnitude could be combined with democracy and a comprehensive 
social safety net. Most returned -- but they spread the word. Meanwhile, the 
East German government permitted increased emigration. 
</P>
<P>
Mainstream West German politicians were jolted by elections earlier this year, 
when right-wing parties rode sentiment against immigrants -- German and 
non-German -- to significant gains. Debate erupted about policy toward East 
Germany, with agreement only that nothing should be done to destabilize the 
situation further. Several West German politicians urged Honecker to undertake 
reforms so East Germans would not seek to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker refused, arguing logically that if East Germany abandoned its 
socialist system it lost any reason for a separate existence. This was an 
implicit admission of an illegitimacy that does not permit compromise. 
</P>
<P>
So for the second time in 30 years, East Germany has been humiliated before the 
entire world, and the Hungarians show no inclination to staunch the flow of 
refugees, most of whom are skilled workers East Germany can ill afford to lose. 
Can the ossified Communist regime survive? 
</P>
<P>
In the short term -- undoubtedly. East Germany withstood graver challenges in 
the 1950s -- an uprising in 1953 and the emigration of one-sixth of its 
population. It could temporarily forbid travel to Czechoslovakia and Hungary 
and absorb the public outrage. An efficient security police can nip serious 
opposition in the bud. The presence of several hundred-thousand Soviet troops 
offers a further guarantee. Economically, the country is far better off than in 
the '50s, even if the gap with West Germany has widened. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the longer term outlook appears dimmer. Honecker's potential successors are 
a provincial lot, not likely to enact necessary reforms. Contrasts with West 
Germany would hardly be more stark. The Federal Republic is the dominant 
economic force in a dynamic European Community now embarked on an ambitious 
program of integration. East Germany remains the engine of a disintegrating 
Comecon organization. The Federal Republic may have security-related disputes 
with some of its North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners, but the political 
underpinnings are solid. The Communist Bloc, on the other hand, is split 
between liberalizing reformers and obdurate conservatives. Its principal power, 
the Soviet Union, is rent by nationalities conflicts and unable to rouse its 
lethargic economy. 
</P>
<P>
All analyses of East and West German relations -- or even European politics -- 
ultimately return to "The German Question," otherwise known as reunification. 
Conventional wisdom has it that no one wants reunification. Perhaps. But East 
German refugees are forcing it back on the agenda. Moreover, some foreign 
attitudes seem to be changing. Poles harbor deep distrust of Germans, but 
Solidarity leaders acknowledge they cannot deny self-determination to Germans 
when they have just won it themselves. French diplomats now speak of 
reunification with equanimity. U.S. Ambassador to Bonn Vernon A. Walters 
recently declared the division of Germany was abnormal and he expected 
reunification soon. 
</P>
<P>
Of course the key to the German Question lies with the Soviets. Other than 
whispers at diplomatic parties, no evidence of the Soviet Union changing its 
veto of reunification exists. Still, deterioration of the Soviet economy and 
social fabric might induce the Kremlin to cut its huge obligations in Eastern 
Europe -- if appropriate security arrangements could be made. Might a neutral, 
drastically disarmed, reunified Germany provide such a security guaranty -- 
particularly if it pledged to rescue the Soviet economy? Farfetched? You bet. 
But last year how many were predicting a non-Communist Polish government? Stay 
tuned.

SAVE NONALIGNMENT FROM ITS CUMBROUS 'MOVEMENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. H. Jansen, G.H. Jansen, the author of Nonalignment and the Afro-Asian 
States(Praeger), has attended six of the nine summits of the Nonaligned 
Movement. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BELGRADE, YUGOSLAVIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To anyone who attended the first summit of the Nonaligned Movement in Belgrade 
in 1961, the ninth summit, held in the same city this month, was an 
anti-climactic and deeply depressing event. This time at Belgrade, it was even 
more evident than at the two preceding summits that the Nonaligned Movement has 
lost its way because it has lost its raison d'etre. It now has little or 
nothing to do with nonalignment as such. 
</P>
<P>
At the two earlier meetings, in New Delhi and Harare, Zimbabwe, members 
complained that the movement had become ineffective and irrelevant, and had 
been bypassed by world events largely because its sessions consisted merely of 
long speeches and longer documents. As a result, Belgrade was designated as the 
summit of reform. 
</P>
<P>
To cut down on documentation, the Yugoslavs drafted a 10-page comprehensive 
final declaration, a summation of the movement's global position, plus nine 
political and nine economic resolutions, about 25 pages long altogether. But 
the 18 resolutions grew to 45; one, on southern Africa, replaced the Yugoslav 
draft of 2 1/2 pages with a text 20 pages long. In short, the movement refused 
to depart from its bad old ways of verbiage and verbosity. 
</P>
<P>
As for matters of substance, the Yugoslav draft declaration really said it all, 
but not for those countries the Yugoslavs described as "conservative and 
dogmatic." 
</P>
<P>
The draft suggested that with the thawing of the Cold War, the priority 
objective of the movement should no longer be rhetorical anti-colonialism, 
necessarily anti-Western. Instead, taking advantage of the thaw, nonaligned 
nations should set themselves new global objectives, such as the environment, 
the menace of drugs, disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
But the conservative dogmatics, stuck in the mind set of the '60s and '70s, 
would have none of it. Colonialism and imperialism are not dead, they insisted, 
and must continue to be denounced. They dredged up the fact that 20 territories 
-- sparrow droppings on the map of the world -- were still under alien 
domination. Their additions to the original draft gave the final declaration a 
fusty, backward-looking tone. 
</P>
<P>
Some participants said the Nonaligned Movement had to find new goals because 
its function was to act as a bridge or a buffer between East and West. This is 
a complete misunderstanding of what nonalignment was supposed to be. Jawaharlal 
Nehru was its sole progenitor and began practicing it in independent India's 
foreign policy after 1948. His concept of nonalignment was that each country 
should have the courage to practice independence of judgment in world affairs, 
irrespective of the positions of the big powers: sometimes with one of them, 
sometimes with the other, sometimes with neither; a policy of active choice, 
not neutralism and not equidistance. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser and Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito did 
not understand the logical conclusion to Nehru's concept -- that the nonaligned 
should be nonaligned even toward the other nonaligned. So in June, 1961, when 
Nasser suggested to Nehru the holding of a conference of the nonaligned, 
leading to a Nonaligned Movement, Nehru firmly rejected the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
Nasser and Tito then went ahead on their own, and Nehru, after long hesitation, 
was embarrassed into attending the first conference in Belgrade in September, 
1961. Nehru's expectation was that nonalignment, as an idea, had to make its 
own way in the world through sincere acceptance by each state -- not by the 
state becoming the member of a "movement." 
</P>
<P>
The change for the worse came in 1964 when the Nonaligned Movement 
automatically accepted as members all 22 nations of the newly formed 
Organization of African Unity. With each successive enlargement in membership, 
from the original 25 to the 102 represented this month in Belgrade, the gap 
between nonalignment and the Nonaligned Movement grew wider. In the last few 
years, an increasing number of members have felt that the movement had become 
not only meaningless but flagrantly hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
But for the sake of form, all -- including the Yugoslavs, the most serious 
members of the movement -- have to sing its praises. Thus the Yugoslavs, in 
their opening speeches, claimed the movement had done much to bring about the 
success of anti-colonialism and liberation. 
</P>
<P>
It is virtually impossible, however, to find a single instance in which the 
Nonaligned Movement as such, or a group of countries acting for it, took 
positive action to push forward a liberation movement. Certainly this did not 
happen in the long drawn-out struggles in Algeria, southern Africa and West 
Asia, or for the displaced Palestinians. The movement's so-called anti-colonial 
"achievements" are a classical case of post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this, 
therefore because of this) -- the logical fallacy of thinking that a happening 
which follows another must be its result. 
</P>
<P>
On almost every issue at Belgrade, members passed the buck to the United 
Nations or the U.N. secretary general. Given this, it is surely time for the 
Nonaligned Movement, its bloated membership two-thirds that of the United 
Nations, to stop duplicating the world body and get out of its way. 
</P>
<P>
Recently the movement has put greater emphasis on economic issues, with a lot 
said about the "New Economic Order" and the "South-South" dialogue. At long 
last, it was openly admitted at Belgrade that these had come to naught, and 
that it is the North-South dialogue that matters -- particularly on the matter 
of Third World debt. Nearly every speaker referred to this terrible menace 
hanging over the economies of nonaligned nations. 
</P>
<P>
Only one speaker was brutally realistic. Libya's Col. Moammar Kadafi, 
forgetting his milk camels and his horses and his nubile female guards, opined 
that since the nonaligned countries had gotten into debt by living beyond their 
means, they were undeserving of either sympathy or assistance. And how serious 
were the 18 economic resolutions, none of which mentioned the prime cause of 
economic woes -- too many babies? 
</P>
<P>
President George Vassiliou of Cyprus told the meeting that the Nonaligned 
Movement's ideas had become commonplace and that it risked being left in 
history's wake. What really needs to be done is to rescue the simple, original 
idea of nonalignment from the cumbrous, inert "movement" that bears its name. 
There are only about 20 truly nonaligned countries: They should be able to slip 
away and do their own thing. But alas, that is highly improbable.

When Prsident George Bush visited Poland last month, he heard from Solidarity 
leader Lech Walesa that Poland needed $10 billion in external aid to rebuild 
its economy and avoid the dangers of political instability and social conflict. 
Predictably, the U.S. reply has fallen far short -- even though Bush did say 
Thursday he was sending additional food aid to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Poland is on the way to installing its first non-Communist government 
since World War II, Washington has agreed to help mobilize an international 
package of assistance worth about $500 million, consisting mostly of World Bank 
loans. This bargain-basement approach would be understandable if it were based 
on a hard-headed calculation of how much external financing the Polish 
government can effectively use or an unwillingness to put any real cash behind 
our foreign policy priorities. For without cash, U.S. priorities become mere 
rhetorical statements of preference, which no one knows how seriously to take. 
</P>
<P>
This is the wrong time for Uncle Sam to have become an international Scrooge. 
Some of the goals that have long been at the heart of American policy may now 
be within reach, yet we run the risk of losing them for want of money. And new 
global problems are emerging -- drugs and environment, for instance -- whose 
solution will require enormous investments. Cold cash may be more important 
than military muscle in advancing our interests in today's world. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the 1940s a fundamental U.S. aim has been to end Soviet domination 
over Eastern Europe and the division of the continent into militarily and 
ideologically hostile blocks. The first hesitant movement in those directions 
is now under way in Poland, where the Soviet Union is today accepting 
non-Communist leadership. If the new government succeeds, it will point the way 
for other countries, and bolster Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform efforts in the 
Soviet Union itself. But Poland's deep economic troubles could overwhelm the 
experiment and produce a prolonged political crisis that would reverberate 
throughout the Soviet Bloc. The curtain might well fall on further political 
liberalization in Poland or anywhere else in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
This scenario is not inevitable, but it is a possibility. With more substantial 
external help than is now being contemplated, the odds favoring a better future 
for Poland could doubtlessly be improved. 
</P>
<P>
It is not only in Eastern Europe that the United States may end up paying a 
high price for its penury. Washington has enthusiastically celebrated Latin 
America's democratic wave of the 1980s, as elected civilian governments have 
replaced repressive military regimes in most countries of the region. But the 
new democracies are still fragile, and their survival remains threatened by 
Latin America's prolonged crisis of debt and economic depression. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has responded to their appeals for help, not with debt relief 
or significant new resources, but with lectures on free-market economics. And 
even those countries that have sought to undertake U.S.-promoted 
market-oriented reforms have found their way blocked by shortages of external 
capital. Turning a cash-starved private sector into a vibrant engine of 
economic growth is not an easy proposition anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
In a period when Latin America is sending some $25 billion a year abroad to 
meet its annual debt payments, and when investment at home is at an all time 
low, U.S. aid to the region totals only $1.2 billion a year -- two-thirds of 
that goes to tiny Central America. The amount for all of South America, where 
the democratic trend has been most promising, was a meager $110 million in 
1988, a negligible fraction of the continent's revenue from the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
And what about narcotics trafficking -- which Americans now identify as this 
country's major foreign-policy problem? Despite our rhetoric about taking the 
war on drugs to the source, the United States has been allocating only about 
$100 million a year -- less than 2% of our federal drug budget -- to help other 
countries eradicate crops, attack criminal networks and seize drug shipments. 
This is spare change for the drug cartels, but it is positively munificent 
compared with what we spend on international environmental problems such as 
global warming and ozone depletion, which threaten untold harm from global 
climatic disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
We seem to have lost sight of the fact that many of our major policy triumphs 
over the years have resulted from the effective and large-scale use of our 
financial resources -- from backing our rhetoric with real money. Our greatest 
postwar success was the Marshall Plan, which prompted Western Europe's economic 
recovery, and thereby helped to avert the political and social breakdown of our 
closest allies. 
</P>
<P>
The Marshall Plan cost the United States some $13.5 billion over four years 
(1948-1952), or about 1.2% of our gross national product, the equivalent today 
of about $48 billion per year -- a virtually unimaginable sum. Today, our 
annual foreign-aid expenditures worldwide -- for development assistance, 
military aid, food shipments and support for multinational financial 
institutions -- are less than one-third that amount. Indeed, we now spend a 
smaller share of our GNP on overseas aid than any other major industrial 
country. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, following Fidel Castro's rise to power in Cuba, we launched the 
Alliance for Progress, the greatest U.S. effort ever to spur economic 
development, social equity and political democracy in this Hemisphere. Although 
the Alliance fell short of its ambitious (and probably impractical) social and 
political goals, it did help set the stage for the region's subsequent rapid 
economic expansion and modernization. President John F. Kennedy pledged to make 
at least $1 billion a year available for the aims of the Alliance -- the 
equivalent in today's dollars of about $5 billion -- or five times what we now 
spend annually in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Money was also a crucial element in achieving the Camp David Accords. President 
Jimmy Carter's promise of economic assistance to Israel and Egypt now costs us 
$8 billion a year -- more than one-half our total foreign-aid budget. Could we 
afford another Middle East peace agreement today? 
</P>
<P>
We are, of course, living in a period of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, of immense 
budget and trade deficits and of domestic savings-and-loan and health-care 
crises. But what is most in short supply is not money; it is our resolve to use 
it to advance our goals and our values overseas. Poll after poll indicates that 
the American people do not want to spend money overseas. Many, if not most of 
us, would even cut back further on our current paltry expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Our tightfisted foreign policy should not be blamed on the American voter, 
however. Our President and our other leaders have the responsibility to lead, 
not merely to mirror public opinion; it is up to them to define what, in fact, 
our vital interests are, to make intelligent choices about how best to use our 
resources to advance those interests -- and then seek to mobilize political 
support behind their choices, whether that requires increased taxes, defense 
cuts or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is, after all, still the richest country in history. We have 
the resources to act as a great power and to make a constructive difference in 
today's world. But we must understand that we cannot do so unless we are 
prepared to place significant resources behind our international goals. We 
cannot hope to build a world that reflects our own best values and long-term 
interests on a shoestring budget.

THE CONVENT AT AUSCHWITZ RECALLS A POLISH PAST MOST WANT TO FORGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
While the Polish Carmelite nuns keep their vigil of prayer at Auschwitz, the 
world watches and argues. These Catholics established a convent in a building 
at the entrance to the concentration camp where, in the Nazi era, more Jews 
were murdered than anywhere else. At that Polish site they force a choice of 
pasts on all who look on. 
</P>
<P>
One choice is between their and their defenders' version of Auschwitz history 
and the version held by Jews and everyone else. These women want to pray at the 
camp because non-Jews -- most presumably Catholic -- were also killed there. 
They would pray for the souls of these Catholics. The nuns wanted to be a sign 
of desire for atonement between peoples. With original good will they also 
hoped to show concern for Jews -- none of whom can accept their form of concern 
and who have now come to despise it. Their staying is a mark of ill-will that 
reinforces old images of Polish deafness to Jewish cries. 
</P>
<P>
To Jews, for whom Auschwitz is a place so profane that no Catholic house of 
prayer in an old Zyklon-B storage house can consecrate it, the past says: Leave 
this scene alone. Let this hell speak of the horrors done here where millions 
of Jews were killed. Let this be a memorial to such Jews and anyone else killed 
here. Whatever else this place is, Catholic Poland, it is not yours to preempt. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Jozef Glemp, Poland's primate, poses a choice of pasts more starkly. 
He would break carefully worked-out agreements to move the convent and demean 
his colleagues who made these covenants. Opposing his version of the issues 
stand four Catholic cardinals who negotiated a move of the Carmelites from 
Auschwitz, many Poles and people everywhere who fear that Glemp gives voice to 
a Polish history that haunts the world. It is a history of anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
Glemp's offensive recent sermon included one barely concealed anti-Jewish 
sentiment per line. Those who wish present-day Poles well in what -- this 
incident aside -- appeared to be their finest hour, interpret the present 
differently because they read the past from a different angle. They know why 
Jews cringe or rage when a Glemp profanes the sound waves and rewrites the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Edward H. Flannery, the priest who 30 years ago wrote "The Anguish of the 
Jews," showed an awareness of that history. He described how Poland had been a 
"happy haven" for displaced people. When Spain persecuted and exiled Jews, 
Flannery wrote, "Poland became a blessed refuge." Four centuries ago, Polish 
Jews "enjoyed a new golden age." 
</P>
<P>
Then came outsiders, Cossack barbarians, who in 1648 killed from 100,000 to 
500,000 Jews. Poles took up the anti-Semitic themes. They also undertook 
anti-Jewish actions and forced the ghetto and persecution on Jews -- because 
they were Jews. In 1881, Russian outsiders began pogroms that found domestic 
Polish sympathizers. Then Hitler's people built Auschwitz while most of 
Catholic Poland was silent. Worse, it sometimes spoke. For just one example: In 
1936, Cardinal Hlond, Glemp's predecessor as primate, in a pastoral order 
publicly encouraged a boycott of Jewish businesses. It is easy to see why the 
few Jews left in Poland cannot surrender Auschwitz even to peripheral Polish 
Gentiles who would forget or rewrite that history. 
</P>
<P>
So the Carmelites and Glemp have chosen one past. They have their sympathizers 
in Poland and elsewhere -- but other Poles and Catholics, who also know the 
history, want to do something different. Being aware of a choice of pasts does 
not mean that people can change the past. The past is not even past, said 
novelist William Faulkner, it is present to haunt us. Auschwitz haunts us now. 
</P>
<P>
If one cannot change the past, the choices it poses allow for people to change 
the present. The past now exists through the stories about it, through the 
attitudes we hold and actions we take. Profane Auschwitz is so important 
because the story has become sacred. Philosopher Theodor Adorno has said most 
of history is suffering. To forget the story, or never to tell it, is to 
dishonor the sufferers and thus to become inhumane. Whenever the story is told, 
hearers can change their attitudes, and with new attitudes can alter the 
present. They do this by repenting. 
</P>
<P>
Max Scheler, the philosopher about whom Pope John Paul II wrote his doctoral 
thesis, made clear how this happens. Repenting, Scheler wrote, is not "rueful 
introspection." It does not ask, "alas, what have I done?" Some have said 
repentance means acknowledging, "Alas! What kind of person I am." Scheler moves 
further: We repent that we were "such a person as could do that." In repenting, 
persons acquire a new vantage. They "mount" to a new plane and see their former 
selves in a light that helps them effect a better future. 
</P>
<P>
Polish anti-Semitism became proverbial not because some fatal gene in the 
Polish makeup caused them to hate Jews. It developed as a reinforcement of 
anti-Jewish policies or because stories were mis-told. Today's Poles who want 
the Carmelites to move, Glemp to repent and Auschwitz to be left empty are not 
only asking of the Polish past, "What kind of a people are we?" but "How could 
our people have done the deeds of anti-Semitism?" When they answer these 
questions on the side of Glemp, they remain imprisoned by the past. They have 
not "mounted" above it; they lack perspective and foreclose the future. 
</P>
<P>
When Poles side with the cardinals who signed the agreement to move the 
convent, they signal an openness to change, to a new story. 
</P>
<P>
The most observed Pole in history, Pope John Paul II, reposes on Vatican Hill 
but has not yet mounted enough to see the signals the Carmelites and Glemp are 
sending out. This man who loves Poland and sees the world through eyes 
fashioned there, has determined this Auschwitz offense is a "local" affair and 
that he should not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
But not to intervene is to intervene. John Paul II is a man of courage who has 
stared down Latin American dictators, lectured U.S. bishops on domestic affairs 
and scourged leaders everywhere who violate the human dignity this Pope cares 
so much about. He has otherwise shown reverence for local-seeming stories. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope may not be able to persuade Glemp, his fellow Pole, to get a new 
perspective, to change -- there is something about hardness of heart and lack 
of vision that makes such change difficult. But the Pope can join the other 
cardinals, including one from Poland, many Polish priests, members of 
Solidarity and others who have made their choice of pasts with more 
understanding and charity. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the agreement to move the convent is honored soon, the Pope cannot 
continue to quarantine Auschwitz by calling it a "local" issue. If he does not 
speak up, he will be seen not as representative head of world Catholicism but 
as a part of local history that Poles of good will and vision are seeking to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
The repentant ones cannot produce "a new golden age" for Jews in Poland -- too 
few remain. But they can act in light of a past that once saw Poland as "a 
blessed refuge" -- a sign for the world's future.

<P>
The best news we've heard in a long time is that sleep researchers now think a 
little shut-eye in the afternoon is precisely what nature intended for the 
refreshment of mankind. 
</P>
<P>
We ourselves have always been acutely aware of the biological urge to cork off 
as the day drags on, but that's something we thought it prudent not to talk 
about in polite society. The truth of the matter is that our inclination to 
catch a nap has always been accompanied by a feeling of profound moral 
irresponsibility, no doubt arising from the culturally imposed notion that 
after the age of 5, real people sleep only when it's dark outside. Now, thanks 
to the studies of scientists around the world, that terrible burden of guilt 
has been lifted. From here on we will feel at liberty to nod off any afternoon 
we feel like it, without regret, resistance, shame or remorse. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, any such naps will have to be enjoyed only on weekends and holidays, 
since our employer -- like others -- frowns on the prospect of paying people 
for snoozing on the job. As it happens, employers may be doing themselves a 
disservice by holding to this traditional attitude. It's long been known that 
work performance declines in mid-afternoon as loginess takes hold. Worse, the 
accident rate rises significantly in the afternoon hours, a fact that seems 
directly linked to a fall-off in mental alertness. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom has long held that afternoon sleepiness is the price we pay 
for eating heavy lunches. Not so, say researchers. What studies have determined 
is that drowsiness sets in, lunch or no lunch, about 12 hours after the 
midpoint of the day's main sleeping period. Thus if a person sleeps from 11 
p.m. to 6 a.m., chances are that by 3 or 3:30 in the afternoon the body is 
ready -- if not frantically in need of -- a nice restorative doze. 
</P>
<P>
People in tropical climates have always been smart enough to go with the flow 
instead of trying to fight what nature has programmed, making the siesta a 
normal and salutary part of their lives. Maybe it's time for people in other 
parts of the world to get back in touch with their biological imperative and 
set aside a portion of each afternoon for an efficiency-raising, 
grumpiness-reducing nap. That's a splendid idea for someone to drop into the 
boss's suggestion box. Don't forget to wake us if you get an answer.

DEEPER, DEEPER IN THE BUDGET HOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one wants to say it, but the nation's budget deficit problem is getting 
worse, not better. Congress and the Bush Administration have joined in cooking 
the books so that it appears the federal government is meeting the Gramm-Rudman 
budget-deficit reduction targets. But that is largely sham, based on accounting 
gimmicks, questionable economic assumptions and on counting billions of dollars 
as income when it should not be counted. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the gimmicks seem harmless enough. For instance, one way to make the 
1990 budget outlook appear brighter is for the Defense Department to meet its 
Oct. 1 payroll in September, just before the new fiscal year starts. A billion 
here and a billion there add up. 
</P>
<P>
Even ignoring the biggest charade of all, the Congressional Budget Office 
believes 1990 spending will create a deficit of $141 billion in the fiscal 
year. Add to that some $60 billion in Social Security receipts that should not 
be considered as income, and the deficit rises to a real figure of about $200 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that very little has changed since Gramm-Rudman was adopted back in 
1985, when the budget deficit crisis really seemed to be a crisis. Every year, 
Congress and the Administration have scraped for perceived savings so as to 
slip, technically, just under the deficit limit. The situation was made even 
worse this year when Congress and the Administration agreed to keep portions of 
the savings-and-loan industry bailout off the budget so they would not trigger 
automatic budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons, of course, that neither Democrats nor Republicans are 
saying much about the deficit these days. In President Bush's first year, 
Democratic are not as quick to try to embarrass Bush as they were Ronald 
Reagan. Bush is struggling to keep his no-new-taxes pledge through his first 
year. Democrats are being agreeable in hopes of setting the framework for some 
sort of bipartisan tax hike next year. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, on the other hand, will not risk being branded as taxers and 
spenders again by going it alone on a tax hike. And neither party has been 
willing to take the political heat involved in challenging the automatic 
increases in entitlement programs such as Social Security and medical services. 
Until they do, there can be no substantial relief from budget deficits. 
Meanwhile, the debt keeps getting bigger, thus compounding the federal interest 
payments that must be made annually. Net interest this year will cost about 
$170 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The real cost to the nation is far greater, than just the interest expense. The 
respected Committee for Economic Development notes in a new report that the 
federal budget deficit, combined with the annual trade debt, jeopardize 
American economic standing in the world. They consume American investment 
income and force the United States to rely on foreign capital. They keep real 
interest rates higher than they should be. With such massive deficits in a 
period of virtual full employment, there is no flexibility for dealing with the 
costs of a possible recession other than watch the deficit soar even higher. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is a relatively modest combination of reductions and reforms 
throughout the budget, selective tax increases that will not harm the economy, 
a considerable dose of political will and a willingness to share the political 
pain. First, however, Washington needs to be prodded into acknowledging that 
the deficit problem has not gone away.

QUALITY OF CARE AT KING HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' expose of the abysmal conditions at the medical center in Watts was 
a chiller -- despite the well-known fact that all ghetto institutions are 
chronically neglected, except the church. 
</P>
<P>
It was noted that relatively low salaries and the fact that the facility is in 
a dangerous neighborhood are responsible for the lack of quality and quantity 
in the professionals who staff that hospital. The environs of King/Drew may be 
more perilous than those of L.A. County/USC Medical Center and Harbor 
General/UCLA, but is the pay less at King/Drew, also a county facility? 
</P>
<P>
And the conservative majority on the Board of Supervisors had the audacity to 
contemplate reducing funds for that meager facility. If anything, funding for 
it should be increased to update antiquated medical equipment and attract 
quality and disciplined medical professionals. The founding of the Watts-based 
medical center was a noble undertaking, but what it has turned into would 
disillusion both Drs. King and Charles Drew if they were alive today.

QUALITY OF CARE AT KING HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is acknowledged that problems exist at the Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital 
and the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science. Nonetheless, your 
series of articles on these institutions were classic examples of one-sided, 
sensationalist journalism. 
</P>
<P>
The King/Drew Medical Center arose from the ashes of the Watts riots in 
response to the urgent needs of a medically under-served community. In 
addressing these needs, it has functioned admirably. The medical center's 
struggle to gain academic credibility and to consistently offer the highest 
level of care can be traced to a number of complex socioeconomic and political 
factors. A more constructive approach to dealing with the problems would have 
been to examine these complexities with a view toward change. Your denigration 
of the medical center based on unscientific case reviews and unfair superficial 
comparisons with other institutions served only to demoralize the staff and to 
create a greater schism between the medical center and the population it is 
desperately trying to help. 
</P>
<P>
The mission of the medical center is now clear and it is finding its course. 
Contrary to your implications, dedicated "top-flight doctors" have chosen to 
come to the medical center because of a belief in its mission and its goals, 
and because of a belief in the attainability of these goals. Other "top-flight 
doctors" from the nation's premier medical schools, residencies, and 
fellowships are scheduled to come because of similar beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
The community served by King Hospital deserves high quality medical care; the 
interns and residents who train in this institution deserve a solid educational 
experience. The series put the institution back a few giant steps in achieving 
these goals. Let's be fair about it and at least present the entire story.

IGNORING THE ELEPHANT: RACE IN THE N.Y. PRIMARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By William Schneider, William Schneider is a contributing editor to Opinion. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In New York politics, the race issue is like an elephant in the room. It's big 
and it's kind of hard to ignore. But everyone pretends it isn't there. After 
all, we're all liberals, aren't we? 
</P>
<P>
New Yorkers were busy congratulating themselves last week because they 
nominated their first black candidate for mayor. Manhattan Borough President 
David N. Dinkins defeated incumbent Mayor Edward I. Koch in Tuesday's 
Democratic primary by a surprisingly decisive 9-point margin. 
</P>
<P>
New York is not exactly the first big city to nominate a black candidate for 
mayor. It has happened in Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and 
Detroit. And those cities not only nominated blacks. They elected them. That 
hasn't quite happened in New York. The general election is not until Nov. 7, 
and Dinkins is by no means a shoo-in -- though Democrats outnumber Republicans 
by 5-1 in this city. He is, after all, black. 
</P>
<P>
New Yorkers dismiss such quibbling. Only 25% of New York's voters are black and 
anyway, who cares what happens in Chicago or Atlanta? If it hasn't happened in 
New York, it hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, one-third of white Democrats voted for the black candidate 
in last week's primary. That's about three times as much support as a black 
candidate typically gets from white voters. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone expected the candidates to get nasty during the campaign, especially 
after the brutal murder of a black teen-ager by white youths in Bensonhurst on 
Aug. 23. But it didn't happen. "Holy smokes!" New Yorkers said. "We did it!" 
</P>
<P>
The city celebrated the outcome with a mixture of pride and relief. The 
Democratic candidates advertised their lack of bitterness with a love-in on the 
steps of City Hall the next day. 
</P>
<P>
New Yorkers are pious about their lack of prejudice. In an exit poll for 
WNBC-TV and New York Newsday, 62% of white Democrats said New York City is 
ready for a black mayor. But only 30% voted for one. In the WCBS-TV-New York 
Times poll, few New Yorkers said race was important in their decision. But half 
of both blacks and whites said they thought race was a major factor for other 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
New Yorkers are embarrassed by racism. But they are embarrassed by something 
else -- Koch. That's why they made such a big deal out of Koch's attack on 
Jesse Jackson last year during the New York presidential primary. Koch said any 
supporter of Israel would be "crazy" to vote for Jackson. So the good liberals 
of New York rose up against Koch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK to be a racist in your own home," a political consultant explained. 
"But God forbid the neighbors should hear." He added, "What Koch did in 1988 
was unforgivable. He let the neighbors hear. He embarrassed New York." 
</P>
<P>
Koch tried to make nice during the 1989 campaign. He kept his mouth 
more-or-less shut and treated Dinkins with respect. But then, after the 
Bensonhurst shooting, he criticized civil-rights protesters and reminded New 
Yorkers of how embarrassing he could be. Never mind that the bishop of Brooklyn 
and several black leaders also criticized the marchers. Koch sounded like a 
Chicago politician. That is unacceptable in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Koch realized his error and tried to make up for it in the last few days of the 
race. He said racial peace is "my cause as well as David Dinkins' cause." But 
it was too late. Two days of good behavior did not make up for 12 years of 
insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
Last year a lot of people thought Koch picked a fight with Jackson to enrage 
the black community. In this scenario, Koch wanted to run against a black, not 
a white liberal. He must have been surprised to discover more Democrats 
disliked him than the idea of a black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest thing Dinkins had going for him wasn't racial tolerance. It was 
Koch. One third of white Democrats had a negative opinion of Koch, and they 
voted 12-1 for Dinkins. Dinkins got double the white support than Jackson got 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign was zany, as New York campaigns are. Cosmetics heir Ronald S. 
Lauder set a new world's record for throwing away money. He spent $13 million 
on his GOP primary race. He got 36,908 votes. That's about $350 per vote. The 
winner of the GOP primary, former-U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, is also 
the nominee of the Liberal Party. 
</P>
<P>
Already New York is suffused with nostalgia for Koch, the man they loved to 
hate. The town is giving him a real New York send-off: "We love you, Ed. Get 
outta here." 
</P>
<P>
The Dinkins campaign now has a problem. They don't have Koch to run against. So 
Dinkins is running against -- would you believe it? -- Ronald Reagan. "Ask 
yourselves, have we scraped and struggled to survive nine years of reactionary 
Republican government in Washington just to hand over our city to the very same 
forces?" he said Wednesday. "New York will not become a Republican beachhead in 
1989." 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins is counting on Democratic partisanship to overwhelm racism. His problem 
is there are several reasons white voters can give for not supporting Dinkins 
besides racism. Dinkins failed to file tax returns for four years -- he says it 
was negligence, not tax evasion. He has the strong support of municipal labor 
unions, so voters may be concerned that he will not be a tough negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins' image as a conciliator was useful against Koch, but it may not be what 
New Yorkers want in a mayor. New Yorkers believe being their mayor is the 
second toughest job in the country. Dinkins has to toughen up his act to 
compete with Giuliani, a crusading prosecutor who has taken on crack, crime and 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The Giuliani campaign has the same problem as the Dinkins campaign. They don't 
have Koch to run against. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani is expected to run as a reform candidate. About every 20 years, New 
Yorkers get sick and tired of corruption and the Democratic machine. So they 
elect an independent mayor on a "fusion" ticket. That's the only way 
Republicans get elected. Fiorello H. LaGuardia did it in 1933 and John V. 
Lindsay in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
With all the scandals of the last four years, 1989 looked perfect for a reform 
candidate. But Giuliani doesn't have a corrupt mayor to run against. So what's 
he going to do? For now, he's decided to run against Koch anyway. On Wednesday, 
he attacked Dinkins as a "clubhouse politician." 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani's problem is the reform vote has already been taken. "The coalition 
that worked for Dinkins was the old Lindsay coalition," a politician intimate 
with reform politics said last week. The politician who said that was Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
The great irony of the campaign is that, with Koch out, both Dinkins and 
Giuliani have to go after the Koch vote. But both know how to do only one thing 
-- run against Koch. What else can they do? 
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later, somebody's going to notice that there's an elephant in the 
room. Both candidates are afraid to break the uneasy racial truce for fear it 
will blow up in their face. Neither wants to be the candidate who divides the 
city. They are even talking about setting up a "hot line" between the two 
campaigns so the candidates can stamp out racial brush fires before they get 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
If the polls show Dinkins collapsing, however, plenty of people will advise him 
to "play the racial card" -- maximize black turnout by running a "movement" 
campaign: "It's us versus them." Jesse Jackson specializes in this and he is 
one of Dinkins' most prominent supporters. No one could deny Jackson the 
pleasure of gloating over Koch's defeat Tuesday. At Dinkins' victory 
celebration, he upstaged the candidate. "They were trying to get Jackson off 
the stage but he wouldn't go," said one Dinkins adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Movement politics is not Dinkins' style. But candidates often do unlikely 
things when their backs are against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
As the GOP underdog in a Democratic city, Giuliani has even less going for him. 
If nothing else works, he, too, may be tempted to play the racial card. 
Giuliani is not, by temperament, a polarizer. But neither is George Bush, and 
look what he did to Michael S. Dukakis last year. In fact, the man who devised 
Bush's campaign strategy, political consultant Roger Ailes, is now working for 
Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
One of this year's hot movies, Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," is set in an 
inner-city New York neighborhood. The black and white characters in the movie 
are decent, well-meaning, sympathetic people who get caught in a situation they 
cannot control. Everyone tries to do the right thing. But forces of conflict 
overwhelm them, and what results is tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins, Giuliani and Koch are also trying to do the right thing. But it is 
easy to see how the situation could get out of control. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, 
the kibitzer-in-chief of New York politics, drew the opposite conclusion after 
the primary when he said, "What Tuesday showed is that there's not enough 
racism left in this town to use against David Dinkins." Between now and 
November, we'll see.

NEW EMPRESS APPLE SEMI-FIRM, SNAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new apple, described as semi-firm and snappy, with good color, texture and 
size, has been named Empress by Cornell University's New York Agricultural 
experiment Station at Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
The apple, with a pedigree dating back 2 1/2 centuries, is reported similar in 
appearance and some characteristics to Empire, named in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
However, Empress ripens a month earlier, which is "a real plus," says Roger D. 
Way, professor emeritus at Cornell. "It means that quality New York State 
apples will be available to consumers well before many other varieties." 
</P>
<P>
The parents of Empress are Jonamac and the new Jersey-bred Vista Bella. Jonamac 
is a cross of the McIntosh and Jonathan. 
</P>
<P>
Way said: "Unlike many varieties that produce well every other year, Empress is 
an annual cropper with consistently good yield. An the apple is the product of 
a relatively small tree, enabling growers to plant more trees per acre, thus 
increasing profits."

MAINTENANCE WILL EXTEND TOOL FUNCTION

<TEXT>
<P>
A little preventive maintenance can extend the life of garden equipment and 
make it safer and easier to use. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the season, it makes good sense to protect hand tools from rust. 
Wash and dry then after use, and at the end of the season polish the metal 
parts with steel wool, then wipe the metal with oil to prevent rust. Lubricate 
tools that have moving parts, including grass, hedge and pruning shears. Use a 
hammer to straighten bent metal edges. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid injuries from s;linters on wooden handles, sand off all rough spots. 
If the wood splits, apply waterproof glue to the area and strap outdoor plastic 
tape over, above and below the split. 
</P>
<P>
Fall is a good time to fix those pesky leaks. To repair small cracks and holes 
in a hose, spread a thick layer of rubber glue over the crack. Bend the crack 
open to allow some of the glue to seep in: let it dry for about 15 minutes. 
Apply a second coat. After the second layer has dried, wind an overlapping 
strip of friction or plastic tape over, above and below the crack.

JUNG-BASHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russell Jacoby's review of my book, "Power and Politics: The Psychology of 
Soviet-American Partnership" (Book Review, July 2) begins with the following: 
". . . Jung was -- to put the best face on it -- confused by the politics of 
his day. In Nazism he glimpsed an ecstatic Wotan; he babbled about the creative 
Aryan unconscious and the inferior Jewish psyche." Jacoby then proceeds to 
belittle ("Americans spout facts; Russians brood. See the problem?"), 
ridicule/belittle (". . . (Bernstein) proposes some practical solutions which 
are . . . inane,") and misread/misquote my work (e.g. attributing the concept 
of "pseudospeciation" to Jung, whereas I quoted the work of Lorenz and Erikson, 
neither of them Jungians). 
</P>
<P>
Jacoby's antipathy toward Carl Jung pervades his entire "review" of my book. 
His antipathy is so intense that he totally dismisses and disparages, virtually 
without analysis, all of Jung's theories. Surely such an international figure 
and scholarly psychiatrist who wrote more than 20 volumes in his lifetime must 
have said something of value -- alleged Nazi sympathies notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
I do not fault Jacoby's hostility over Jung's anti-Semitism and his alleged 
Nazi sympathies. The former seems clear; the latter appears to be questionable. 
As a Jew I have some feeling about this aspect of Jung myself -- to the point 
where I chaired a workshop on Jung and anti-Semitism at the Jung Foundation's 
International Congress in Paris last month. However, I do fault Jacoby and The 
Times for lack of objectivity, poor editorial management, and questionable 
editorial ethics. It seems to me that Jacoby's objectivity, necessary to do a 
professionally competent review (of any book) was lacking. If he needed to 
attack Jung and his theories, he should have done so by reviewing one of Jung's 
works, not by using my book as a club for Jung-bashing.

LAWMAKERS CALL SESSION A SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
WORKERS' COMP, TRANSPORTATION PLAN LISTED AMONG MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GEORGE SKELTON, Times Sacramento Bureau Chief 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the Legislature trying to clean up its image and the governor worried 
about his place in history, blurry-eyed state lawmakers adjourned for the year 
in the pre-dawn Saturday after having passed enough major bills to assure that 
their 1989 session will be considered a success. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor has changed. The Legislature has changed. We're all getting older 
and tired of the old-fashioned fight," said veteran Assemblyman Phillip 
Isenberg (D-Sacramento), a member of Speaker Willie Brown's inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
Then referring to the GOP governor and the Democrat-controlled Legislature, 
Isenberg echoed the view of many by adding: "Republicans finally figured out 
they are running the state and had better start running it. We figured out we 
aren't running the state but could help. . . . It took us six years to figure 
out that George Deukmejian is governor and that we are no longer in charge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem-Solving Role 
</P>
<P>
Observed one longtime Republican legislator who did not want to be identified: 
"The governor finally became the governor. He was more directed toward 
problem-solving than in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Among the Legislature's final acts before recessing until January was passage 
of a bill revamping California's $8-billion system for compensating injured 
workers. It also passed sweeping legislation aimed at controlling the growth of 
solid waste, or garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Both issues had for months been high on the priority lists of Deukmejian and 
the Legislature. So their accomplishments, after weeks of delicate negotiations 
between the governor and legislative leaders, generally were regarded as 
crowning achievements for a session that already had produced a bold plan for 
financing new transportation projects and relaxing the tight lid on state and 
local government spending. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I can go home for the first time in seven years and not have to 
apologize for this Legislature's activities," Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-La 
Mesa) told a reporter shortly after the lower house quietly adjourned at 3:42 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Yawning lawmakers did not drag themselves out of the Senate until 4:11 a.m. 
"This was an extraordinary session," asserted Senate GOP Leader Ken Maddy of 
Fresno. "Think back. It's hard to find another year in which we did more." 
</P>
<P>
Some accomplishments, however, involved only modest steps at best. Passage 
early Saturday of a scaled-down bill aimed at providing health care for 
uninsured workers fell far short of what had been sought all year by the 
measure's author, Speaker Brown (D-San Francisco). "I should be embarrassed to 
handle (the bill) on this floor," Brown told his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
What passage of Brown's bill did illustrate, however, was a new eagerness by 
Deukmejian and Brown to compromise in an effort to attain at least half a loaf, 
although in this case the Speaker probably got only a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Veto Likely 
</P>
<P>
But there were exceptions to this conciliatory attitude, including a major one 
on the final night when Brown pushed through a bill to provide auto liability 
insurance for low-income drivers at only $25 per month. The rub was that the 
governor and the Speaker never came to a meeting of minds on this issue and 
Brown's victory is expected to be short-lived because Deukmejian very likely 
will veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
This "take-it-or-leave-it" attitude by Democratic leaders -- so prevalent in 
past sessions -- was the exception rather than the rule this year on big 
issues, however. Deukmejian called it his "most enjoyable year in terms of the 
working relationship between myself and the legislative leaders." 
</P>
<P>
There was plenty of motivation on both sides to cooperate and get things done. 
Both the governor and the Legislature had been widely criticized -- by business 
leaders, academics, local government and the news media -- for alleged lack of 
leadership and vision. State government wasn't working, critics said. 
Legislating had been relegated to ballot initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature especially was feeling the heat because of a drawn-out, highly 
publicized FBI investigation into alleged Capitol political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
In this framework, legislators began worrying about voter wrath in the 1990 
elections and Deukmejian -- who decided not to seek a third term -- became 
acutely concerned about his legacy. Additionally, Brown -- who already had 
served as Speaker longer than any predecessor -- began fretting about how he 
would be remembered by historians. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody finally told the governor this year that 'if you want to go down in 
the history books, you've got to resolve problems,' " said a Deukmejian 
supporter, who asked not to be identified. "And he began kind of enjoying it 
(problem-solving)." 
</P>
<P>
Many legislators of both parties said the Capitol political climate changed for 
the better when Deukmejian announced he would not run for reelection. Democrats 
no longer considered him a long-term threat -- the positive flip side to being 
a weakened lame duck. The governor basically agreed Saturday: "Once I announced 
(retirement), Democratic lawmakers could feel a little more comfortable in 
working with me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Political Handlers' 
</P>
<P>
One influential Republican legislator, who asked for anonymity, added this 
observation: "Deukmejian's not running for reelection and therefore everything 
doesn't have to be run by his political handlers." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), a veteran legislative insider who 
helped negotiate the transportation package, said the improved Capitol 
atmosphere resulted from "a combination of factors -- a sense that the state's 
not moving ahead, the infrastructure is deteriorating, the vision of California 
is becoming clouded. Everybody came to that realization about the same time. 
And the FBI investigation obviously motivated the Legislature to do something." 
</P>
<P>
One thing the Legislature did do on the final night of the session was to 
approve a broad ethics package aimed at curbing special-interest influence -- 
but also paving the way for a substantial pay raise in return for banning 
honorariums and limiting gifts. "It's going to be viewed as curious to the 
public that in response to an ethics crisis we voted ourselves a salary 
increase," Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) said during the floor 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the determination of both branches of government to chalk up some 
major accomplishments, Senate GOP Leader Maddy said: "It was a matter of 
timing. The governor was ripe for doing something. And there was the dynamics 
of Willie (Brown) wanting to be 'a policy-maker.' " 
</P>
<P>
For Brown, this was a year he tried to discard his image as a political 
wheeler-dealer and turn to the business of solving the state's problems. Many 
believe he took some significant steps, but images are difficult to redraw -- 
especially for a political animal like Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, one person's "achievement" usually is another's "setback," especially 
on controversial issues. Gun control is a prime example. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature, supported strongly by Deukmejian, last spring voted to ban 
semiautomatic assault rifles -- a move seen by most Californians as a laudable 
achievement, according to the polls. But many gun groups bitterly saw this as a 
setback and never quit lobbying the Legislature as it debated additional bills 
to control firearms. 
</P>
<P>
As lobbyists for the National Rifle Assn. stood as political sentries outside 
the chamber, two gun control bills died on the Assembly floor shortly before 
adjournment Saturday. One would have limited "banana clips" and other rifle 
ammunition magazines to 15 rounds each. The other would have required 
inexperienced handgun purchasers to complete a two-day course in firearms 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Another 11th-hour failure -- in the eyes of many -- was the inability of the 
Legislature and the governor to agree on a $147-million supplemental budget 
package, including $24 million for family planning. It got hung up on demands 
by Deukmejian and GOP lawmakers for new language forbidding use of the family 
planning funds for anything that might smack of assisting abortion. 
</P>
<P>
According to knowledgeable sources, Democrats decided not to wage an all-out 
fight over the issue, preferring instead to blame Republicans for killing 
family planning programs and thereby gain a political issue. They also realized 
they can take up the issue again in January when the Legislature convenes the 
second half of its two-year session. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Deukmejian was trying to use the $147-million budget package as a 
bargaining chip for a prison labor program he badly wanted. But he gave up 
Friday night and tentatively decided to try to place a prisons job initiative 
on the November, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature also did nothing during the session to help implement 
Proposition 103, the 1988 ballot measure that tightened regulation of the 
insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
But the governor and lawmakers, after long negotiation, agreed on how to 
implement Proposition 99 and spend its $600 million per year in new tobacco tax 
revenue. Most of the money will go to county hospitals, emergency centers and 
health programs for the indigent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATIVE SESSION HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 As the Legislature headed for adjournment of its 1989 session early Saturday 
morning, lawmakers groped to resolve a number of major issues. The following is 
a summary of what the issues were and what happened to the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
THE ISSUE: WORKERS' COMPENSATION -- An effort to overhaul California's troubled 
$8-billion system for compensating injured workers included two bills that 
would increase the maximum temporary disability benefits by 50% over two years 
and boost permanent disability payments by 7.5%. The measures also would 
implement changes aimed at speeding up the system, improving the effectiveness 
of vocational rehabilitation and restricting the ability of injured workers and 
employers to shop around for medical evaluations that best suit their purposes 
in a disputed claim. 
</P>
<P>
THE OUTCOME: APPROVED -- A two-house conference committee worked out 
last-minute differences on one of the bills, by Assemblyman Burt Margolin 
(D-Los Angeles), which then breezed through both houses. The measure won with a 
34-0 vote in the Senate and 65-2 tally in the Assembly. The companion bill by 
Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) also won easy approval, with a 68-0 vote in the 
Assembly, which sent it to the Senate for a quick 36-0 approval of amendments. 
The measures now go to the governor for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
THE ISSUE: LEGISLATIVE ETHICS -- Under a cloud because of an FBI probe of 
political corruption in the Capitol, lawmakers have been considering a number 
of measures that would reform the way legislative business is conducted. The 
keystone of the ethics package is a constitutional amendment that would bar 
legislators from accepting honorariums, impose a limit on gifts and prohibit 
lawmakers from lobbying for one year after they leave office. It would also set 
up an independent commission to set their salary -- a move that could mean a 
doubling of the present level of $40,816 a year. 
</P>
<P>
THE OUTCOME: APPROVED -- The constitutional amendment by Senate President Pro 
Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) passed on lopsided votes, 33 to 3 in the 
Senate and 68 to 7 in the Assembly and will be placed on the June, 1990, 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
THE ISSUE: GUN CONTROL -- After a successful effort earlier in the session to 
ban the sale of many semiautomatic weapons in response to the killing of five 
children in a Stockton schoolyard, legislators considered several other 
proposals to regulate the sale and use of guns. One measure would require a 
two-day course in gun safety and proper storage before a handgun could be 
purchased. A second bill would limit the capacity of rifle ammunition clips to 
15 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
THE OUTCOME: DEFEATED -- In response to intense lobbying by gun owner 
organizations, led by the National Rifle Assn., the Assembly refused to pass 
both the safety instruction bill by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) on a 
37-31 vote, and the ammunition clip restriction measure by Assemblyman Johan 
Klehs (D-Castro Valley), 36 to 32. The bills required 41 votes for passage. 
</P>
<P>
THE ISSUE: SOLID WASTE -- With local governments beginning to run out of room 
to bury trash, lawmakers worked with Gov. George Deukmejian on several measures 
designed to cut in half the amount of garbage trucked to landfills by the year 
2000. With an emphasis on recycling, the proposals would establish a full-time 
state solid waste management board with broad powers. Critics objected that the 
plan would encourage the use of incinerators to meet trash reduction goals and 
complained about the composition of the board. 
</P>
<P>
THE OUTCOME: APPROVED -- The most far-reaching of the solid waste bills, a 
measure by Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo Alto), was approved 22 to 15 in 
the Senate and quickly sent to the Assembly, which voted 42 to 25 to accept 
Senate amendments. The measure now goes to the governor, who is expected to 
sign it. 
</P>
<P>
THE ISSUES: FAMILY PLANNING, MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING, PRISONS -- A bill that 
would appropriate $146 million for a variety of state and local government 
programs became embroiled in a controversy over whether state family planning 
funds were being used to promote abortions. The measure was also linked to 
negotiations over a contentious Deukmejian plan to permit private industry to 
contract with the state. At stake in the debate was the restoration of $24 
million for family planning programs that had been vetoed earlier by the 
governor. But the same measure included funds for other programs, including $25 
million for mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
THE OUTCOME: DELAYED UNTIL NEXT YEAR -- The Assembly on a 51-24 vote rejected a 
compromise bill that would have prevented the use of family planning funds for 
abortions. The measure required 54 votes for passage, two-thirds of the 
80-member Assembly. And the governor's prison measure remained bottled up in an 
Assembly committee. As a result, the $146-million appropriation bill by 
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) was never taken up on the Senate 
floor and must now wait for consideration until January, when the Legislature 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
THE ISSUE: AUTO INSURANCE -- Lawmakers nibbled at the problem of the high cost 
of automobile insurance with a pair of complementary bills intended to get 
uninsured drivers off the road and to help poor people find affordable 
insurance. One of the measures would extend the requirement that all California 
drivers carry at least a minimum auto insurance policy. The other bill would 
require insurance companies to offer a $25-a-month policy to low-income people 
-- to single individuals earning $20,000 or less or to families with incomes 
below $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
THE OUTCOME: APPROVED -- Both the mandatory insurance bill, by Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Tarzana) and the affordable policy measure, by Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) won last-minute approval in the Senate and 
Assembly. The two bills go to the governor, who has said he probably will veto 
Brown's bill. 
</P>
<P>
THE ISSUE: HEALTH INSURANCE -- Legislators looked at proposals intended to 
provide health insurance for an estimated 2.5 million uninsured California 
workers, but could not agree on how to fund it. What did emerge were two bills, 
one of which would provide a $300-per-employee tax credit for companies that 
offer health insurance to their workers. A second bill creates a task force to 
study the idea of requiring businesses to provide such insurance and requires 
the Deukmejian Administration to report back by March, 1990, on ways to lower 
the cost of such coverage. 
</P>
<P>
THE OUTCOME: APPROVED -- The tax credit bill, by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia), 
and the study measure, by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown were both approved by 
the Senate and Assembly and now go to the governor for his signature.

KENNARD SEEKS HER OWN WAY ON HIGH COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Justice Joyce L. Kennard, strengthening the belief that she may provide pivotal 
votes on the state Supreme Court, says she has established a "streak of 
independence" since joining the court last April. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you I am not a token presence," Kennard, the court's only female 
member, said in an appearance Friday night before the California Women Lawyers, 
most of whom were here for the annual meeting of the State Bar of California. 
</P>
<P>
During the Bar's gathering on Saturday, its Conference of Delegates adopted a 
resolution urging state lawmakers to reject attempts to weaken privacy and 
abortion rights, should the U.S. Supreme Court cut back on such rights under 
the federal Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard's remarks Friday, made in her first major public speech since joining 
the high court, indicated she may frequently serve as a centrist "swing" vote 
on the conservative-led state court. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard, 48, was the surprise choice of Gov. George Deukmejian to succeed 
Justice John A. Arguelles, who retired from the state high court last March. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, she was generally expected by legal experts to follow the same 
moderately conservative path of the four other Deukmejian appointees to the 
court. But her relatively brief judicial record -- three years as a trial and 
appellate court judge -- still left considerable uncertainty about her 
philosophical views. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexpected Votes 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the high court, Kennard has often joined with the conservative 
majority. But, somewhat unexpectedly, she also has sided with liberals in some 
notable instances. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in her first majority opinion, she upheld the death sentence of a 
convicted killer. But in another case, with three conservative justices 
vigorously dissenting, she wrote a lead opinion that sharply limited the 
ability of prosecutors to bring second-degree felony-murder charges against the 
provider of an illegal drug that results in the death of the user. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, Kennard broke ranks with the conservative majority when the 
court widened the power of municipalities to use zoning ordinances to restrict 
the location of theaters that show sexually explicit movies. In her dissent, 
Kennard expressed concern that the legal standards the court set were too vague 
for theater owners to follow. 
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Kennard warmly praised the other members of the high court but, 
without discussing any particular cases, emphasized her intention to chart an 
independent judicial course. 
</P>
<P>
"The votes I have cast in certain decisions and opinions I have authored have 
established a streak of independence," she said. "This independence did not 
stem from a desire to disagree. I did what I did because, as I saw it, the law 
and facts dictated a particular result in a particular case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Welcomes Gains of Women 
</P>
<P>
Kennard also welcomed the gains women have made in recent years in the legal 
profession -- a part of her speech that drew an enthusiastic reception from her 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"How nice it is to see so many women in their proper place -- here at the State 
Bar . . . rubbing elbows with the 'old boys,' " she said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard is the second woman to serve on the state high court. The first, Chief 
Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, left office after being denied reconfirmation by 
voters in the November, 1986, election. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Conference of Delegates' adoption Saturday of the resolution 
designed to protect abortion rights in California came by an overwhelming voice 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was passed as an expression of sentiment from the 500-member 
Conference, which is composed mainly of representatives of local Bar 
associations. The resolution would become official policy of the Bar if 
approved later this year by the Bar's Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
One of the proponents, Grace E. Emery of Santa Ana, told fellow delegates she 
is "pleased and proud" the measure was supported by the delegation from Orange 
County, "the land of rugged individualism and the home of John Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
"Keep the government off our backs and out of our bedrooms," Emery declared. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief discussion of the issue, no delegates spoke against the 
resolution. But afterward, Andrew Landay, a Los Angeles lawyer, told reporters 
he was dismayed that the measure passed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm all for choice, but the choice has to be made before intercourse," Landay 
said. "The right to privacy shouldn't have precedence over the right to life."

AFTER MIDNIGHT, EXPEDIENCE GOVERNS OPEN MEETINGS BILL;

<P>
It can make people do strange things, this business of passing legislation in 
the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
There was Assemblyman Charles Calderon, determined to win approval of his bill 
to require open legislative meetings, rushing to the Senate a few minutes after 
midnight Saturday wearing the borrowed coat of lobbyist Clay Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
It would not have seemed so peculiar except for the fact that the huge 
insurance lobbyist's coat hung down to Calderon's knees and the assemblyman's 
hands barely poked out of the sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
But the rules of the Senate require men to wear a coat and tie at all times on 
the Senate floor, and the Whittier Democrat was eager to push through his bill 
-- part of a major package of ethics measures -- before the Legislature 
adjourned in the early hours of Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Calderon's measure led a charmed life. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is designed to make the Legislature follow the same kind of open 
meeting rules that already apply to local governments. It would require all 
committees of the Legislature to hold their meetings in public, except for 
discussions of personnel matters, security or litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative leaders had agreed to support such a measure after they were 
embarrassed by disclosures that important decisions were being made in secret. 
For example, The Times reported earlier this year that legislators secretly 
voted to award themselves more than $1 million in special benefits such as 
airline tickets and car phones. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of private meetings last week, legislative leaders and their aides 
agreed on the language that would go into the open meetings bill. 
</P>
<P>
Friday evening, as legislators considered dozens of last-minute measures, the 
provisions were amended into a bill pending on the Senate floor that, up until 
then, would have modified rules for the operation of the California Lottery. 
The name of the original author of the bill, Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd 
(D-Carson), was removed and Calderon's name was added. 
</P>
<P>
The next stop was the powerful Senate Rules Committee. Senate President Pro Tem 
David A. Roberti, committee chairman, agreed to hold a meeting on the bill 
shortly after midnight in a little room off the floor of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
As Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and three other weary members of the committee 
waited, the medium-sized assemblyman scrambled to find a coat. Rushing to the 
meeting in Jackson's giant jacket, Calderon came across a Senate staffer who 
was closer to his size. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
This Time a Blazer 
</P>
<P>
The assemblyman borrowed his second coat of the night and arrived at the 
meeting in a nice blue blazer. Calderon said later of the staff member: "I 
don't know his name but I'd recognize him if I saw him again." 
</P>
<P>
For Calderon, arriving at the meeting was the hardest part of getting the bill 
passed. With the Rules Committee's approval, the bill moved to the Senate 
floor, where it came up shortly after 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) rose to question whether it was a violation 
of the Senate's rules to place the open meetings provisions into a lottery 
bill. But Roberti quickly walked over and whispered something into his ear. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand this is not the right time to ask the question," McCorquodale 
said and sat back down at his desk. The Senate then approved the measure 
without debate on a vote of 38 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
At 1:30 a.m., the bill came up on the Assembly floor. "This is the single most 
important action we will take to show the public our commitment in terms of 
reform," Calderon told his colleagues. Again without debate, the bill was 
approved by a vote of 73 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
In less than an hour and a half, the measure had passed both houses and was on 
its way to Gov. George Deukmejian -- without ever facing a public discussion of 
its merits. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, pushed by the Newspaper Publishers Assn., is one of several measures 
that would be required to implement a proposed constitutional amendment 
approved Friday by both houses of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethics Package 
</P>
<P>
The constitutional amendment, which will be placed before voters in June, 1990, 
sets forth basic policies of ethical government, including a ban on 
honorariums, a limit on gifts legislators can receive, a limit on lobbying by 
legislators who leave office and the requirement that legislators hold their 
meetings in public. The measure also would create an independent commission to 
set legislators' pay. 
</P>
<P>
One bill that would spell out the proposed restrictions on lobbying by former 
lawmakers was held in the Assembly to await further amendments and will be 
taken up next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly also held up action on a bill that would create a loophole in 
state campaign laws and allow legislators to raise unlimited amounts of money 
from special interests to defend themselves in court. 
</P>
<P>
A leading backer of the bill, Assembly GOP Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, 
said legislators were just too worn out to take it up. "It's something I 
believe we should do but the hour was late and people were tired," he said 
after the Assembly adjourned at 3:42 a.m. "We'll deal with that in January."

Counties lost a chance at an additional $25 million in mental health funds when 
the Legislature adjourned early Saturday without passing a $146-million 
spending bill, a development that leaves Los Angeles County bracing for a new 
round of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials say they had been counting on passage of the 
budget bill to provide money to help prevent the shutdown of five mental health 
clinics. Los Angeles County's share of the $25-million statewide allocation 
would have been $7.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
But state officials believe that Los Angeles County will still have enough new 
state funding to help support its mental health programs. Under a bill passed 
by the Legislature on Thursday to implement the Proposition 99 cigarette tax, 
Los Angeles County would receive about $360 million for health programs, some 
of which could be used to eliminate pressure for mental health program cuts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$2 Billion in Aid 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian noted during a press conference Saturday that counties 
will receive about $2 billion in new financial aid from the state this year 
when cigarette tax funds and other money is counted. 
</P>
<P>
"The counties are receiving a tremendous amount of money this year," Deukmejian 
said. As to whether the money will be used for mental health programs, 
Deukmejian said, "that is going to be a decision that each county is going to 
have to make for itself, depending on its own priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County was counting on the additional mental health funds to make 
up for earlier Deukmejian Administration mental health program cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The $7.3 million would have been enough to prevent the closing of five mental 
health clinics and forestall cuts in funding to dozens of privately operated 
facilities, county mental health Director Roberto Quiroz said. 
</P>
<P>
The county last June was forced to close three mental health clinics because of 
a budget shortfall. County officials have warned that if no additional funding 
is provided, five more mental health clinics will close, reducing the number 
countywide from 28 a year ago to 20. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the money in the pipeline, during its budget deliberations in June, the 
Board of Supervisors provided enough money to keep the clinics open only until 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
However, "the latest round of cuts could cripple us," said Susan Mandel, past 
president of the Assn. of Community Mental Health Agencies and head of a 
privately operated mental health clinic in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The county supervisors have complained that the state has required the county 
to provide mental health programs without providing adequate funding. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a state bailout, the county could keep the mental health 
clinics by dipping into an estimated $14-million windfall in property tax 
revenues discovered after approval of the budget. However, supervisors have 
been reluctant to commit local funds to mental health, which they claim is a 
state responsibility.

Los Angeles.

Forty Nevada law enforcement officers, including FBI and DEA agents, police, 
deputies and game wardens, carried picket signs protesting the auction here 
Saturday of "Mountain Man" Claude Dallas' personal effects. 
</P>
<P>
The auction netted close to $10,000 for Dallas' defense fund set up by friends 
and admirers to win him a new trial in the latest episode in the continuing 
saga of the hunter-trapper considered a cold-blooded killer by most, a folk 
hero by some. 
</P>
<P>
He killed Idaho game wardens Bill Pogue and Conley Elms in his remote desert 
lair on the Idaho-Nevada line Jan. 6, 1981. He was a fugitive until his capture 
in an FBI shoot-out 16 months later, was found guilty of manslaughter and 
sentenced to 30 years. He escaped prison in March, 1986, and was recaptured a 
year later in Riverside, Calif. He is being held in the Lansing, Kan., 
penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
Pogue and Elms were attempting to arrest Dallas for poaching deer when he shot 
the officers through the head at close range. He pleaded self-defense at his 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carrying Signs 
</P>
<P>
The signs carried by the picketing law enforcement officers proclaimed these 
and other messages: "What Next, Charlie Manson's Property?" "Blood Money," "If 
You Bid, Contribute Equally To The Victims' Family," "Claude Dallas Is A 
Murderer. He's No Hero." 
</P>
<P>
Nevada game warden Steve Albert's son, Johnny, 3, walked beside his father 
carrying a sign that read: "Daddy, It's Really Not OK To Kill Game Wardens, Is 
It?" 
</P>
<P>
Inside the auction warehouse jammed with 150 people, spirited bidding took 
place for an arsenal of 17 guns, scores of knives, thousands of rounds of 
ammunition, Dallas' clothing, snowshoes, glasses, cooking utensils, his 
library, including the book, "Kill Or Get Killed," and even four "petrified" 
biscuits found in his oven when he was captured by the FBI. The biscuits 
brought $25. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of Dallas' spurs went for $350, his Green Mad River canoe $250, a rope 
$80, his saddle $1,250, the revolver he had when he was captured $450 and an 
AR-15 assault rifle $725. 
</P>
<P>
Don Klarid, 38, a Reno businessman who bought Dallas' wallet and birth 
certificate for $100, said, "I'm really not a Dallas supporter, I just 
recognize this stuff is becoming more and more valuable as time goes by." 
</P>
<P>
The bidding was by the curious, by collectors, by supporters and friends of 
Dallas. More than 150 people jammed the Stremmel Auction center. Renae Hoff, 
38, of Caldwell, Ida., Dallas' attorney, said she spent years trying to obtain 
her client's personal belongings from authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signed Certificates 
</P>
<P>
In signed certificates that went to each successful bidder, Dallas described 
the various items, such as: 
</P>
<P>
"This is the gun I had when I was captured by the FBI." "This rifle helped me 
through the winter when I was hiding out." "I bought this gun in a bar in 
Midas, Nev." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Stremmel, 35, owner of the auction house, closed the center's large doors 
when the sale started to prevent the sign-carrying law enforcement officers 
from viewing the activity inside. 
</P>
<P>
"I neither condone nor condemn the man who owned this property," Stremmel said. 
"It's just another business deal to me. I get the usual percentage." 
</P>
<P>
He has been severely criticized by officers and others for conducting the sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Glorifying a Murderer' 
</P>
<P>
Hoff, Dallas' attorney, said the auction was held in Reno "because Claude has 
many friends in this area. We're overjoyed with the results. This money is 
going to go a long way to achieve justice in our struggle to get his freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Nevada game warden Fred Messman, 42, one of the picketers, commented: "I can't 
believe what's going on. It's really bizarre. Those people are in there 
glorifying a murderer." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Spencer, 46, one of five FBI agents carrying signs, was involved in the 
shoot-out that resulted in the capture of Dallas. "Those people are in there 
making a hero out of a man who shot two policemen. That's why we're here. It 
just isn't right, and we want the public to know how we feel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And, inside, many among the bidders expressed their feelings as to why they are 
supporting the man who shot and killed two game wardens. Walt Weaver, 40, of 
Sparks, Nev., said: "I'm a hunter. I've been stopped by game wardens. They 
treat you like criminals. In my mind I think Dallas acted properly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bullying Him' 
</P>
<P>
Said Al Marshall, 58, a Reno carpenter: "Those officers have no right picketing 
a private business. I'm against the law of bullying. That's what those two game 
wardens who were killed were doing to Claude Dallas. They were bullying him." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas has been the subject of two books, songs and a CBS television movie. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to put a stop to this myth. That's why we came out to protest the 
auction, to let people know what kind of a human being Claude Dallas really 
is," said Todd Shipley, a Reno detective and president of the Reno Police 
Officers Protective Assn.

SLOW GROWTH

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1989 legislative session ended with little action on a topic that seemed 
hot just a few months ago -- community growth management. 
</P>
<P>
After several years of furious battling over city and county initiatives, 
leaders of the slow-growth movement had said they would move their campaign to 
the state capital, in a search for regional or statewide solutions to air 
pollution, traffic congestion and other growth-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
Hearings were held, reports were written and more than 50 bills on the subject 
were introduced by various legislators. But, in the end, only a handful of 
relatively meaningless measures were passed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bills Defeated, Delayed 
</P>
<P>
Legislation that would have established statewide growth standards or 
established regional bodies with sweeping powers to plan growth either were 
defeated or were put off for further study. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local governments continued to depend heavily on builder fees to 
finance needed roads, schools, sewers and other infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
Fees on a new single-family house now average more than $15,000 in some areas 
of the state. This has helped to push the statewide median house price to 
$202,650, a figure that only 16% of California households can afford, according 
to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of interviews, legislators, staff members and experts of various 
kinds attributed the lack of significant growth-management legislation to a 
weak effort by slow-growth advocates, skillful lobbying by the development 
industry and increasing evidence that local governments are trying to cope with 
growth problems, among other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the leaders of grass-roots, slow-growth organizations failed to appear 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"They were not visible, they were not players," said Peter M. Detwiler, 
consultant to the Senate Local Government Committee, which handled much of the 
growth-management legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"Those local initiative groups had a great opportunity to participate in the 
legislative process this year but they never showed up," said Madelyn 
Glickfeld, a Los Angeles planning consultant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weary of Battle 
</P>
<P>
Some may have been weary of battle, especially after suffering defeats at the 
hands of well-financed developer campaigns in Orange, Riverside and San Diego 
counties last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Those initiative campaigns wore down the citizen groups tremendously," said 
Joseph E. Bodovitz, president of the California Environmental Trust, "and they 
felt they got run over by a builders' bulldozer." 
</P>
<P>
But Don Collin, lobbyist for the Building Industry Assn., offered another 
explanation. "There was no constituency for those bills," Collin said. "This 
was a classic example of Tip O'Neill's statement that all politics is local . . 
. growth is an issue that depends on local dynamics and a local set of 
factors." 
</P>
<P>
While supporters of growth controls may have been inactive in Sacramento, 
Collin and other lobbyists for builders and developers were not. 
</P>
<P>
"The BIA has a lot of influence," said Casey Sparks, consultant to the Assembly 
Local Government Committee. "They blocked most of our bills," referring to a 
growth-management legislative package that was proposed by Assemblyman Dominic 
L. Cortese (D-San Jose), the committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers wondered if the Legislature is capable of dealing with the kinds 
of major changes that supporters of regional or statewide growth controls were 
seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature is not set up to deal with this kind of issue," Glickfeld 
said. "It cuts across too many existing committees. They would only deal with 
it in case of a great disaster." 
</P>
<P>
"And you have a governor who doesn't care about these issues," she added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treat Issue Seriously 
</P>
<P>
Another important reason for the failure of growth-management legislation is 
that more cities and counties are beginning to treat the issue seriously, 
reducing the need for statewide action. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is that you're seeing (local) government responding to this issue," 
said Mark Pisano, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments. 
</P>
<P>
After Measure A, a countywide slow-growth initiative, was defeated in June, 
1988, the Orange County Board of Supervisors proceeded to approve a 
growth-management plan that contains many of Measure A's provisions. Still 
others will become law if voters approve a half-cent sales tax increase that 
will be on the ballot in November. 
</P>
<P>
Growth-management plans also are being produced in Riverside and San Diego 
counties, as well as in other cities and counties throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The California League of Cities and the County Supervisors Assn. are putting 
together a joint proposal, and other planning efforts, such as the Los Angeles 
2000 organization, have growth control elements. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost but we won, I guess you could say," said Tom Rogers, one of the 
organizers of last year's unsuccessful Orange County slow-growth initiative. 
"It's kind of like the Japanese after they signed the surrender on the 
(battleship) Missouri -- look at 'em now!" 
</P>
<P>
Even though growth management as such fared poorly in the Legislature, several 
measures that did pass contain key growth-control provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Most important is the "congestion management" portion of the 10-year, 
$18.5-billion transportation program that will go into effect if voters agree 
to lift the state spending limit in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of this legislation, which was authored by Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar), and the new controls planned by the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District "could have a considerable impact on growth management," 
consultant Glickfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
Detwiler, the Senate committee consultant, noted that legislation aimed at 
"specific topic areas," such as traffic congestion or air quality or solid 
waste, was more successful than the broad-brush growth-management bills. 
</P>
<P>
But that does not mean that slow-growth supporters have abandoned the idea of 
statewide solutions. "We'll be back," Rogers said. 'The sentiment is still 
there."

NATION SUFFERS BATTLE FATIGUE; 
</P>
<P>
SALVADOR REBELS NOW SAY ONLY PATH IS PEACE

<P>
Salvadoran guerrilla commander Joaquin Villalobos, who has built Latin 
America's strongest rebel army and steered it through nearly a decade of civil 
war, said Saturday that he now believes the way to make revolutionary change is 
through peace. 
</P>
<P>
Villalobos said that the rebels of the Farabundo National Liberation Front 
realize they cannot achieve their revolutionary goals alone and, instead, must 
ally themselves with centrist political sectors. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas' top military strategist and one who long held that a popular 
insurrection in El Salvador was inevitable, Villalobos acknowledged the battle 
fatigue that exists in that country now. 
</P>
<P>
"After 10 years of war, the only thing that can unite the nation and make use 
of all its energy to transform society is peace," Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Do It Alone 
</P>
<P>
"Can the FMLN (guerrillas) do it alone? No, we can't. It's impossible. Did we 
used to think we could do it alone? Yes, but everything advances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Villalobos and commander Schafik Jorge Handal spoke in a wide-ranging interview 
Saturday, a day after the guerrillas' first peace talks with the 3 
1/2-month-old government of President Alfredo Cristiani. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels presented the right-wing government with an offer to lay down their 
arms and organize a political party in exchange for sweeping reforms of El 
Salvador's military, system of justice and constitution. They want a new 
attorney general, Supreme Court and legislative assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Villalobos, 38, heads the Popular Liberation Forces, largest of five armed 
groups in the Farabundo Marti front. He left his stronghold in El Salvador's 
Morazan province almost a year ago to begin the rebels' current initiative for 
negotiations. He said that months of consultations with leaders and politicians 
of other countries contributed to the front's peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
The two commanders said that a series of factors, such as the international 
move to end armed struggles and the arrival of the more-pragmatic Bush 
Administration after eight years of President Ronald Reagan also influenced 
their decision to push for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The commanders said their key demand for ending the war is a dramatic reduction 
in the size and power of the Salvadoran armed forces to ensure civilian rule. 
</P>
<P>
"We are asking for the demilitarization of the country as a way of seeking 
revolutionary change to achieve the absolute predominance of civilian society. 
If this had been suggested six years ago, it would never have occurred to us to 
accept it. There were too many interventionist policies in the world," 
Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas' proposal already has been attacked by conservative army 
officers and leaders of Cristiani's Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena 
party) who believe that the rebels cannot be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
Villalobos and Handal emphasized that they are not calling for prosecution of 
the military for war crimes or for the killings of thousands of students, 
peasants, church workers and union leaders in the early 1980s by so-called 
"death squads" trying to wipe out the growing rebel movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Relent on One Case 
</P>
<P>
But the rebels insist that the one case that must be prosecuted is the 1980 
assassination of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero of San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"Society has to have a clear example that this (death squads) has been 
dismantled," Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson, a founder and power behind the Arena party, 
is widely believed to have ordered Romero's assassination and was openly 
accused of it by former President Jose Napoleon Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have expressed the belief that D'Aubuisson is untouchable. Asked 
if the rebels mean that D'Aubuisson must be tried, Villalobos answered, "How 
can you have democracy when the head of the death squads is there?" 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the rebel leaders defended a series of killings by 
the rebels this year, including that of Atty. Gen. Roberto Garcia Alvarado, who 
Villalobos said was slain because he had blocked prosecution of the Romero 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of his defense of death squads, he was a legitimate target," 
Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
Handal, on the other hand, said the rebels "erred" when they killed Francisco 
Peccorini, a Salvadoran-American dual citizen and ideologue of the extreme 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"It sent the wrong message that we execute people for what they think and not 
for what they do, when we are willing to respect all of those who do not think 
as we do," Handal said. 
</P>
<P>
The commanders maintained that the rebels had nothing to do with the killing of 
Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, Cristiani's minister of the presidency who was 
shot to death in front of his home last June. They believe his death and that 
of another rightist ideologue, Edgar Chacon, were the result of an internecine 
battle among far-rightists. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what guarantees the guerrilla peace plan offers the government against 
future rebel attacks, Handal said, "The guarantee we're offering is that we are 
going to disarm." 
</P>
<P>
But first, Villalobos said, the rebels must go about the job of uniting with 
other political groups to push for their plan. The rebels believe that sectors 
of the military and even of Cristiani's Arena party will work with them to 
settle the war. And with the Arena party in power, they believe that a majority 
of Salvadorans want change. 
</P>
<P>
"If in 1980 we had been able to elaborate a policy that could have united the 
nation, I suspect we would be having this conversation somewhere else," 
Villalobos said in the lobby of a Mexico City hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"But we made serious errors. We didn't know how to approach sectors of the army 
and capitalists. The payment for that grave error has been 10 years of war," he 
said. "Now what we are saying is that we are not going to miss this second 
opportunity."

Typhoon Vera killed 48 people, injured 190 and left 26 missing when it struck 
the East China province of Zhejiang, the New China News Agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
It said the typhoon, the worst to hit the province in 27 years, flooded the 
port of Shujiang, closed down a major power plant and inundated 195,200 acres 
of rice fields and orange groves Friday and Saturday in the area south of 
Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain caused many rivers and ponds to breach their banks and many 
rivers to exceed danger levels, the agency added, but it gave no more details.

Police said they made Africa's biggest seizure of illicit ivory Saturday in 
Namibia, arresting 22 suspected smugglers in the pre-dawn operation. About 980 
elephant tusks and 14 rhino horns weighing more than seven tons were seized in 
a series of raids, police spokesman Colonel Johan Meintjies said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest haul made in Africa and could be the biggest ever made," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meintjies said the ivory had been transported Friday in a refrigerated 
vegetable truck from Rundu on the Angolan border to Okahandja, near Windhoek, 
before the police launched their raids. 
</P>
<P>
He said the nationalities of the 22, who included whites and blacks, were not 
yet known but six were Portuguese-speaking.

SRI LANKA GUNMEN MASSACRE 82 CIVILIANS IN VILLAGE RAMPAGES

<P>
Gunmen rampaged through three villages in central Sri Lanka, burning and 
shooting to death at least 82 Sinhalese civilians in repeated night raids, 
residents and military officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
An army officer said the killers are believed to be pro-government vigilantes 
seeking vengeance for the deaths of 15 soldiers' relatives killed by radicals 
of the Sinhalese People's Liberation Front. The gunmen wore military-style 
uniforms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
They started the massacre Thursday in Menikhinna village, about 55 miles 
northeast of Colombo, the capital, according to military officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. At least 50 houses in the village were torched Thursday 
and Friday night, said the officials. 
</P>
<P>
Searchers had found 52 bodies there as of Saturday, some with gunshot wounds 
and others burned, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The raiders also attacked neighboring Kundasala and Aranagala villages and 
killed 30 people, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The villagers were unarmed, according to the officials. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in Kandy, a few miles from Menikhinna, said at least 100 bodies have 
been found in the three villages, and at least 50 more people may have been 
killed and their bodies thrown into a nearby river. 
</P>
<P>
Menikhinna is believed to be a stronghold of the People's Liberation Front, an 
ultranationalist guerrilla group trying to overthrow the government. 
</P>
<P>
By official count, at least 5,000 people have died in the two-year-old 
Sinhalese revolt. The radicals began fighting to protest government concessions 
to minority Tamils fighting another war for an independent homeland in 
northeastern Sri Lanka. Sinhalese radicals also resent the deployment of Indian 
peacekeeping soldiers supervising a peace accord with the Tamils. 
</P>
<P>
Tamils make up 18% of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and charge they are 
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the government and 
military.

One of France's leading "revisionist" historians, who claims the Holocaust 
never took place, was severely beaten Saturday by three youths said to belong 
to a group called "The Sons of the Memory of the Jews," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Faurisson, 60, was ambushed by the youths while walking his dog in a 
park in Vichy. The trio repeatedly kicked and punched Faurisson, breaking his 
jaw, then ran off, a police report said. 
</P>
<P>
Faurisson was admitted to a Vichy hospital, then transferred to a hospital in 
the nearby city of Clermont-Ferrand. 
</P>
<P>
French radio said the attack was claimed by the previously unknown group, which 
said in a statement that "Faurisson is the first but will not be the last." 
</P>
<P>
"Let those who deny the Shoah (Holocaust) beware," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The same group was named as responsible for the attack in a telephone call to a 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
"This individual (Faurisson) is the origin of the Carmel of Auschwitz affair 
that is dividing gravely the Jewish and Catholic communities," the caller said. 
</P>
<P>
The reference was to the dispute over the presence of a Carmelite convent at 
the World War II Nazi death camp in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Faurisson is one of the leading French members of a "revisionist" school of 
history that says there is no evidence that 6 million Jews were killed in Nazi 
gas chambers during the war.

PONTIAC'S NIGHTLY MARCHERS ESTABLISH DRUG-FREE ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PONTIAC, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The drug dealers of Colombia and the United States have guns and bullets, but 
the people of Pontiac have feet to march with, hands to clasp in prayer and 
voices to raise in protest and lamentation. 
</P>
<P>
And every night at 7, the people of Pontiac, led by an elderly woman named 
Marie Johnson, are using their feet, hands and voices to do battle against 
crack and crack dealers, which have settled like a plague upon this city's poor 
black neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picking Up the Chant 
</P>
<P>
"No more crack in Pontiac," they chant, hundreds of them, as they march down 
Jessie, Wall and Osmun streets, through some of Pontiac's most drug-infested 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Black and white adults, children, people in wheelchairs -- they were all there 
Friday, for the sixth consecutive nightly march in this city's new grass-roots 
campaign to establish a drug-free zone in at least one battered neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Pray for the drug dealers," a local minister called out. "Picture a drug 
dealer, coming to testify to Jesus, crying, 'I want to go another route.' " 
</P>
<P>
Each night so far, 300, 400, even 500 people have joined in, sometimes in the 
rain, marching from a black Baptist church to a park a few blocks away where an 
innocent 19-year-old youth was killed when he was caught in the cross-fire of a 
drug feud. 
</P>
<P>
And each night, they stop for a time in front of 62 Wall St., a reputed crack 
house; then they march on to the park, now renamed Steed Park for the slain 
youth. For the last few blocks, they march in silence. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 500 feet, "you can only hear the beating of feet on the pavement," 
Marie Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
Under police escort, the marchers then form up around the park, ready to 
silently stare down any drug dealers who have set up shop in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But the dealers now know about the marchers and have apparently moved their 
operations, at least temporarily, to other sections of the city. Neighbors tell 
the marchers that they haven't seen any drug activity on Wall Street all week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Through Rain and Snow' 
</P>
<P>
Marie Johnson vows that the community will keep the marches going, every night, 
"through rain and snow, until the drug dealing ceases in Pontiac." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here every night, and it seems that every night the crowds get 
bigger and bigger," adds Ruth Steed, the mother of the slain boy. "That says 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Kicked off last Sunday with a march led by national activist Dick Gregory, the 
campaign in Pontiac, a deeply troubled industrial city of 70,000 about 30 miles 
north of Detroit, is part of a larger phenomenon around the nation. 
Increasingly, the people of America's inner cities -- including in Los Angeles 
-- appear to be fed up and ready to do something about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Other towns are trying to follow Pontiac's example, and the effort here is 
starting to gain national attention. On Friday, city officials explained the 
campaign to Congress in a hearing before the House Select Committee on 
Narcotics Abuse and Control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor Visits Louisiana 
</P>
<P>
Pontiac's marches are patterned after a similar effort that Gregory helped 
mount in Shreveport, La. Pontiac Mayor Walter Moore visited the Shreveport 
marchers and then suggested to community activists that nightly marches might 
also help in Pontiac. Marie Johnson then got on a local radio station to ask 
for volunteers, and hundreds have come every night since. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wanted to do it," Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
Pontiac police officials are glad for the new community involvement, but some 
rank-and-file officers remain skeptical about its lasting impact on Pontiac's 
booming drug traffic. While the neighborhood that the marchers have targeted 
now seems a little quieter, there are plenty of other areas where drugs still 
openly flourish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Epidemic Proportions' 
</P>
<P>
"We've got 350 crack houses in a city of 70,000," Pontiac policeman Leonard 
McCallep said. "It's at epidemic proportions right now. And people are going to 
buy no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson and the other marchers, encouraged by the waves of support they 
have received, vow to keep going, pledging to beat drugs peacefully, with 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to keep on marching, we are going to keep on singing and we are 
going to keep on praying," she says. "We're going to love the dope dealers and 
the pushers. We think they need love, and we think that we're going to turn 
them around with love."

CAUSTIC CLOUD FORCES MORE THAN 200 TO EVACUATE HOMES IN CHINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200 Chino residents were evacuated from their homes and seven people 
were briefly hospitalized for lung and eye irritation Saturday, after a caustic 
cloud rose from an industrial complex where unidentified chemicals were being 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Those hospitalized, including five police officers, were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the white-colored cloud escaped as employees of General Chemical 
Corp., 5568 Schaefer Ave., were combining a batch of chemicals. The employees 
fled the building, then notified police and fire officials, said Sgt. Ron Zerr 
of the Chino Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Because of unpredictable wind patterns, police evacuated all homes within a 
quarter-mile radius of the plant. Zerr said residents of the upper-middle-class 
San Bernardino County neighborhood about 35 miles east of Los Angeles remained 
calm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Under Control' 
</P>
<P>
"The situation was under control," he said. "There was no panic." 
</P>
<P>
Residents were allowed back into their homes at 3:15 a.m., after environmental 
health officials determined that the cloud was not poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Chino police could not say exactly what is manufactured at General 
Chemical, although they did say that the plant mostly deals in acids and 
solvents, not toxic compounds. 
</P>
<P>
A man who answered the telephone at General Chemical refused to say anything 
about the company, which was incorporated in 1973.

LOOKING DOWN ON L.A. SKYSCRAPERS; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE CRITICS CALL DOWNTOWN'S NEWEST 'ORDINARY' 
</P>

If only they had stayed at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
From there the city's skyline, recently crowned by the tallest building on the 
West Coast, looked good enough to a group of visiting architecture critics who 
gathered here Saturday to survey the city's latest attempts to beautify its 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Up close, however, it was the same old story. Downtown Los Angeles, long a 
target of disdain by Eastern critics, took it in the chops once again. 
</P>
<P>
"Ordinary," said Michael Sorkin of the Village Voice. "We're living in a fairly 
exciting time. There are some exciting propositions out there," he said, 
referring to buildings in other cities. "How come none of them are appearing 
here?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Developer Driven' 
</P>
<P>
Robert Campbell of the Boston Globe replied that certain extraordinary cities, 
such as Paris, are full of ordinary buildings, but he seemed to find little 
about this city's latest face-lift to get excited about. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said that the downtown's newest and proudest achievement, the 73-story 
First Interstate World Center, made for "a pretty eloquent form on the skyline" 
but from street level was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like what I see so far," Campbell said of the building's unfinished 
base. 
</P>
<P>
John Pastier of Architecture Magazine described the building as "developer 
driven," a structure whose shape was determined by financial considerations. 
For two-thirds of the way up, Pastier said, the building lacks distinction, its 
shape determined by the need for a large, uniform floor plan. Only toward the 
top, where the contours begin to change, does the building have some interest, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other critics on the panel were Diana Ketcham of the Oakland Tribune and 
Suzanne Stephens, the panel's moderator, a former editor of Progressive 
Architecture and now a teacher of architectural criticism at Barnard College. 
</P>
<P>
The critics, none of whom work for local newspapers, were invited here by LA 
Architect, the publication of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute 
of Architects. The critics, joined by the architects of three of the buildings 
under discussion, took part in a daylong symposium titled "Critics and Cranes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Island of New Construction 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the symposium was to focus on an island of new construction, 
surrounding the Central Library at 5th Street and Grand Avenue, which the city 
hopes will become a model for a prettier and livelier downtown. The 
neighborhood is important for a number of reasons. With the Biltmore and the 
library, it boasts two of the city's most valued historic buildings. The area 
is situated between Bunker Hill and Pershing Square and is seen as a link 
between the downtown's old and new quarters. 
</P>
<P>
When all of the construction is complete, the neighborhood will be festooned 
with kiosks, plazas, open-air cafes, an outdoor stairway and other gathering 
places that planners hope will draw people from all walks of life and end the 
segregation that has made the area around Pershing Square a sort of Maginot 
Line between rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the buildings discussed at the symposium are complete or near 
completion. They are First Interstate World Center, which was designed by 
architect I.M. Pei, and the Biltmore Tower, a commercial addition to the 
Biltmore Hotel designed by Thomas H. Landau of the Landau Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium also focused on Norman Pfeiffer's design for the ongoing 
expansion of the Central Library and on the California Gas Tower. The architect 
of that 54-story building, which is barely under way, is Richard C. Keating of 
Skidmore, Owings and Merill. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, Pfeiffer and Landau attended the symposium. They discussed their 
buildings but, for the most part, did not debate the critics. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the critics, Ketcham of the Oakland Tribune, said that 
preservation of the Central Library had loomed too large on the architectural 
agenda and that the public's demand for faithfulness to the design of the 
original library perhaps had inhibited creativity in the immediate 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"When so much of the thinking about what is to be built next is colored by 
sentimentality over preservation, it can lead to architects feeling that they 
have to build background buildings," she said.

They are the backbone of arts organizations, providing up to 90% of the 
audiences and of the revenues. Most are fiercely loyal and willing to volunteer 
their support, such as subscriber Betty Rockwell has done for years at the 
Pasadena Symphony. But some are fickle, as the Master Chorale of Orange County 
is discovering as the novelty of its new home at the Performing Arts Center 
wears off. Even the mighty Los Angeles Philharmonic has a 25% annual subscriber 
turnover rate. At the Pacific Symphony in Orange County, the goal is to retain 
75% to 80% of all subscribers, and at 65% renewals this year it will be a 
struggle. Why are subscribers so imporant? Single-ticket sales are "scary," 
says Deborah Rutter of the L.A. Chamber Orchestra, "because you never know how 
you're doing until the last minute." As the 1989-90 music season begins, here 
are five portraits of these key people, the subscribers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Rockwell, a lifelong supporter of the Pasadena Symphony, grew up hearing 
the orchestra and has followed its fortunes since she was a music and art 
student at Occidental College in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth-generation Californian with a longtime passion for music (she collects 
musical instruments), Rockwell remembers how American women, as volunteers, 
often ran their symphonic organizations in the days before professional 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
In those years, volunteer labor, sometimes even from orchestra members, 
characterized U.S. symphonic life outside the largest cities. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell says that at one time -- around 1970 -- before Civic Auditorium went 
all union, she arranged the subscriber seating in the auditorium. "I did that 
for two years, usually working night and day," she recalls of the era before 
computers when chores like seat-assignment were complicated manual jobs. Today, 
thanks to electronics, seats are allotted in microseconds for the Pasadena 
Symphony's nearly 2,000 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell also served on the finance committee of the orchestra for 13 years, 
was president of the women's committee for two, and treasurer of the finance 
committee for four years. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of every season, we would get on the phone and try to convince 
people to renew their subscriptions. Sometimes we had to do quite a selling job 
-- people always had so many other choices, it seemed." 
</P>
<P>
She has lived in Pasadena with her husband Bill since 1957. They have also been 
subscribers to the L.A. Philharmonic -- where they have been Wednesday-night 
subscribers for 25 years -- and L.A. Civic Opera, among other producing 
performance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to the opera and ballet, but my husband doesn't," says Rockwell, seated 
in the quiet living room of her comfortable, Spanish-style home, not far from 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"He loves the symphony, and grew up with it, but wasn't exposed to opera and 
ballet." 
</P>
<P>
From its inception in 1928, the Pasadena Symphony has drawn an audience made up 
mostly of residents of the San Gabriel Valley. Even today, according to manager 
Robert McMullin, "we have very few subscribers from the Westside, and not many 
more from the San Fernando Valley. Our audience comes from Pasadena, South 
Pasadena, Arcadia, Altadena and other nearby communities, like Glendale and 
Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
But that audience is loyal. When subscribers do not renew, says McMullin, "It's 
almost never because of anything as controversial as programming. It's because 
they move away, or find they buy a series of five concerts and are too busy to 
attend more than one or two. Or because, as they grow older, some people choose 
not to go out in the evening." Nevertheless, "This year our renewal rate is 
about 80%." The cost of five concerts ranges from $50 to $110. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Rockwells have been close, Mrs. Rockwell says, to the 
musical leaders of the orchestra, as well as to players in the ensemble. When 
Richard Lert retired in 1972, the couple hosted the post-concert party honoring 
him. 
</P>
<P>
And she is still a close friend of former Pasadena music director Daniel Lewis, 
as well as a great admirer of the current conductor, Jorge Mester. Rockwell 
says she is proud of the orchestra's long tradition of bringing new and 
contemporary music, as well as standard works, to its subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a friend in Chicago who is well over 80. About listening to new music, 
he says, 'I don't like it, but I want to know what's going on.' " 
</P>
<P>
That's close to what Rockwell says about her own tolerance for contemporary 
compositions. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two things about new pieces. First, I want to learn. Then, I like to 
stay young."

BLOODY SHADOWS OVER CHINA; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER THE UPRISING AND CRACKDOWN, BEIJING INSISTS IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL WITH 
U.S. ENTERTAINMENT FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Several weeks before the June massacre of pro-democracy students in China, the 
American producers of the $10-million "Shadow of China" -- starring John Lone 
(the Emperor in the Oscar-winning film "The Last Emperor") and Vivian Wu (who 
played the second wife in "Emperor") -- asked the Chinese government for 
permission to film in a village outside Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The sequence the producers wanted to shoot was of a young revolutionary 
escaping from China, an eerie coincidence in light of subsequent real-life 
events. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, a fictional story, has Lone as a young revolutionary fleeing China 
at the end of 1976 and becoming a wealthy capitalist in Hong Kong. He is 
involved in corrupt activities until he makes an idealistic decision to return 
to China in 1989 as the country becomes more open to democratic influences. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the independent production was in Hong Kong the night of June 3-4, 
filming the Lone character's impassioned speech about wanting to return to 
China. "Someone came into the room and said, 'They're killing students in 
Beijing,' " recalls the film's American producer, Elliott Lewitt. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, the Chinese government granted permission for the production 
to film in China, but the indignant cast and crew voted not to go. "They felt 
that shooting there would be part of China's 'business as usual' pose, that it 
would be a betrayal of those who had died," said Elliott. Instead, the 
production shot the escape-from-China scene in Japan and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott wasn't surprised that Chinese authorities would permit filming an 
uncomplimentary scene about China on home territory. American film and 
television producers and distributors who have recently dealt with China say 
that entertainment bureaucrats in the People's Republic are going out of their 
way to maintain active show-business relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It's a curious situation. On one hand, China's leaders have blamed "bourgeois 
liberalization" and Western influences for helping to foment the pro-democracy 
movement in China. On the other, the People's Republic is clearly urging the 
United States to keep that bourgeois entertainment coming. 
</P>
<P>
In response to faxed questions to the government-run China Film in Beijing, the 
agency's Xiaolin Chen responded that "June 4th will not affect film production 
in China and the Sino-U.S. Film exchange will not be stopped and/or changed but 
will continue." 
</P>
<P>
In the People's Republic hierarchy, China Film -- which imports, exports, 
distributes and co-produces feature films -- falls under the Film Bureau, a 
part of China's 
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Radio, Film and Television. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been no changes in the leadership of the Film Bureau, China Film, 
film studios and other film organizations," Chen said. "No actors or middle 
level cultural officials have been arrested (as was reported in some 
publications) . . . Mr. Zhong Guo, deputy head of the foreign affairs 
department in the Film Bureau, told me that policies in the Chinese film 
industry have not been changed . . . The door is always open to people who are 
interested in making films in China." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. show biz presence in China was at a high point when the Beijing 
bloodbath occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, when China Film began licensing and distributing U.S. movies on a 
regular basis, Chinese audiences have flocked to American movies ranging from 
relatively new hits such as "Superman" and "First Blood" (the first Rambo 
movie) to oldies like "Spartacus" and "Roman Holiday." The oldies drew 
audiences of more than 20 million each, according to Chen. 
</P>
<P>
Episodes of U.S. television series such as "Hunter" and "Falcon Crest" have 
drawn Chinese audiences as high as 400 million, according to Michael Salomon, 
president of Warner Brothers Television International, which handles Lorimar, 
Warners and Telepictures programs overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon has received "several faxes from Shanghai TV saying they are very 
anxious to keep the programs on the air and to keep doing business with us," he 
said. "As far as I have learned, there was no order given by the government to 
take Western programs off the air. In fact, I was told that they want to 
encourage Western programming on the air because they want to show the Western 
world that really very little has changed in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Mike Wise, who has an agreement with Tri-Star Pictures and Shanghai 
Studios to co-produce a movie called "Judge Dee" next year, said he has heard 
from a contact at Shanghai Studios "saying there's no problem, and not to worry 
about anything. It's business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the reassurances from China, some U.S. entertainment industry 
professionals are wary of the climate there. On Sept. 5, Chinese media reported 
that Minister of Culture Wang Meng, who was a force behind more liberal 
policies in literature and the arts, has been fired and replaced with a 
hard-liner, He Jingzhi. 
</P>
<P>
"On the surface, it's like absolutely nothing has changed (in the Chinese film 
industry)," said Canadian producer Nicholas Clermont, who has worked closely 
with Chinese film officials for several years as the producer of the upcoming 
"Bethune," a Chinese/French/Canadian co-production about a Canadian physician 
who gave assistance to Mao Zedong and other Chinese revolutionaries during 
their struggle for power. 
</P>
<P>
But, Clermont cautioned, "Nobody really knows how much things have changed and 
will change." 
</P>
<P>
"My optimism (about China) paid off until the students were slaughtered," said 
Warner's Salomon. In the massacre's aftermath, he said, "It's been very, very 
difficult to renew some (U.S. and Western) advertisers that we had." 
</P>
<P>
The advertisers, who had sponsored "Hunter" and "Falcon Crest" on Chinese TV 
for the past two years, fear that the consumer market for such Western products 
as film, toothpaste and watches may "be stagnated" in China for the next couple 
of years, according to Salomon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK for the stations to telecast our programs, but how many sponsors want 
to continue buying spots? My guess is not very many," he said. (Salomon 
declined to name the worried sponsors, explaining, "It may be embarrassing for 
them and I don't want to jeopardize something that has taken us two years to 
build up.") 
</P>
<P>
Salomon said he isn't sure whether "Hunter" and "Falcon Crest" are airing now 
because, following the massacre, he shut down the Hong Kong office that handled 
the series in China, though he hasn't given up on the People's Republic yet. 
He's hired a woman born and raised in Shanghai to check out the situation for 
Warners, and, he said, "I intend to go to Shanghai (in October) to see for 
myself what exactly is going on." 
</P>
<P>
Told of the moral stance taken by the "Shadow of China" group, he said, "You 
could take that attitude, but at the same time, we are in a business, you have 
to run a business. You have to ask yourself, 'Is it important to keep Western 
programming on the air?' " 
</P>
<P>
Lei Geye, a People's Republic citizen and employee who is acquisitions director 
of China Film's Los Angeles-based U.S. office, said she doesn't think China 
will stop importing U.S. films, but added that censorship may be more strict 
now, at least concerning violence. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the massacre, however, Chinese officials occasionally changed their 
mind about releasing certain U.S. films in theaters. In 1986, the Rambo movie 
"First Blood" was showing to packed audiences in China when officials -- 
irritated by the movie's violence -- swiftly jerked the film from theaters. 
</P>
<P>
One source close to China's entertainment bureaucrats, who asked not to be 
identified, predicts that "Censorship will be stricter for those (film and 
video distributors) near Beijing and Shanghai, but for other provinces, it 
won't be that strict. Beijing and Shanghai will be very, very strict because 
they are near the government, and you know all the things that happened there." 
(Following the slaughter in Beijing, there were were also arrests and 
executions in Shanghai.) 
</P>
<P>
For Mitsuo Yanagimachi, the Japanese director of "Shadow of China," the 
decision not to shoot in China was "wrenching" for aesthetic reasons, according 
to the film's publicist. But the producers of the production, which was 
financed by a consortium of Japanese investors, including Nippon Herald and 
Fuji-TV, were swayed by the multi-national cast and crew's group vote not to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
Said the film's American script supervisor, Susan Malerstein, "I've been raised 
to believe that you must take a stand when it comes to political and ethical 
beliefs. . . . I could not go to China and in any way by my presence show 
support for the government's heinous actions against the Beijing students." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "business as usual" is precisely the attitude taken by most U.S. 
film industry people with Chinese dealings. China Film has invited several U.S. 
film companies to participate in a "Film Executives Seminar" in November, 
joining hoped-for speakers from French companies and the U.S.S.R.'s 
Sovexportfilm, the invitation says. Faxed from Beijing July 11, five weeks 
after the massacre, the invitation states that the seminar's purpose is 
"promoting cooperation and film exchanges." 
</P>
<P>
"I expect we'll attend, " said Bill Shields, chairman of the American Film 
Market. "Most of our members (who had pacts with China) are still doing 
business and I am myself." 
</P>
<P>
Shields is president and CEO of New World International, which he said has sold 
about $500,000 worth of entertainment to the Chinese since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
According to Murray Schultz, a New World vice president, the New World sales to 
China include about 75 videos, such as the movie "Da," and 12 TV series, among 
them "Crime Story." Approximately 20 of the titles have been licensed to China 
since June 4. "I haven't noticed any pulling back (on the part of buyers 
there)," Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
MCA, Paramount and MGM/UA are continuing to release movies theatrically in 
China through UIP, an overseas distribution company jointly owned by the three 
studios. UIP sales vice president Andrew Cripps, speaking by phone from Hong 
Kong, said the American companies are contractually obligated to continue their 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want this to sound like we're not considerate of the (student deaths) 
but we are in a position where we have a legally binding contract," Cripps 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, which began in 1987, calls for 21 films to be released through 
next year. It consists mainly of old movies ("Love Story," "Coma," "Network,") 
but even the dated "Bathing Beauty," a 1939 Esther Williams film, "has been 
incredibly successful," Cripps said. "Our intention is certainly to talk to 
China Film about renewing the contract once things settle down and everything 
gets back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
Grace Ip, a Los Angeles-based independent movie and video sales agent who 
handles U.S. products being sold to China, has been busy as ever since the 
massacre, she said. Ip is hired as an intermediary by U.S. distributors such as 
ITC Entertainment Group because she is of Chinese origin and speaks and writes 
Mandarin and Cantonese. 
</P>
<P>
While she was on the phone with a reporter, she received a call from a video 
dealer in Henan Province who said, Ip recounted, "We need more cassettes, we 
need more titles, could you just send me whatever you have." 
</P>
<P>
The dealer recently sold 2,400 copies of the Duke of Windsor-Wallis Simpson 
story, "The Woman He Loved," she said. "That (sales figure) is very good." 
(Starring Jane Seymour, the video aired here as a mini-series.) 
</P>
<P>
Personal VCR ownership is rare in China, but videos are viewed in communal 
situations that amount to mini-theaters, attracting average audiences of 50 to 
200 people. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, China Film was the only buyer in China for videos," Ip said. 
"Now there are about 100 buyers (dealers in provinces throughout China)." Ip 
estimates that each dealer buys from five to 50 videos a year. 
</P>
<P>
Since June 4, Ip also has sold several videos and two 1988 movies to China Film 
for theatrical release: "Without a Clue," a satirical takeoff on the Sherlock 
Holmes legend, starring Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley, and "Stealing Heaven," 
starring Derek DeLint and Kim Thompson in a fictional tale about the 
12th-Century romance of philosopher-monk Abelard and nun Heloise. 
</P>
<P>
"All the contracts are still operating as usual and we are getting through 
censorship," Ip said. "But for the future, who knows?"

PACINO RE-FOCUSES ON FILM CAREER; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER FIVE-YEAR ABSENCE, ACTOR RETURNS TO THE BIG SCREEN 
</P>

<P>
So there was Al Pacino on "Wheel of Fortune" -- not the one with Vanna White, 
the one on CBS in the early 1950s that rewarded good deeds. It seems that 
someone had called the show's attention to an incident involving young Al and 
his 12-year-old buddy Brucie Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
As the episode was reported on the show, Al and Brucie were playing around at a 
construction site in the Bronx when Brucie, showing off near the edge of a 
building, toppled over and clung to the edge until Al, at the risk of his own 
neck, pulled him back. The next thing Al knew, the TV show was handing him a 
check and calling him a hero. And if he didn't know it already, he was suddenly 
aware of the difference between stupid risks and good ones. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be able to really define what a risk is," Pacino muses on this 
Dante's Inferno day, with the air-conditioning at producer Martin Bregman's 
office no match for New York's Oscar-winning humidity. With the erotic 
mystery-thriller "Sea of Love," which opened Friday, Pacino is nonetheless 
draped in funereal black -- part Bela Lugosi, part bella Armani. Sweaty-eyed 
and weary, starting sentences four different ways before he latches onto the 
words he wants, Pacino gamely explains how risk-management has kept an actor 
deemed one of the four or five post-Brando gods away from movies for almost 
half a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing a picture when you're not prepared to is not a good risk," Pacino says 
slowly, in a voice like charred gravel. "I mean, jumping off a building and 
seeing if you're 
</P>
<P>
gonna make it when you fall . . . 'Hey, maybe I'll just break a couple of 
legs!' " he jokes. "So much has to do with where you are, your timing and 
stuff. When you start to feel you wanna make a movie again, then whatever 
(script) is there, available, you start to look at a little bit differently. 
Because it's a reality -- your gonna do it." 
</P>
<P>
That's a relief, because he hasn't done it in quite a while. We're talking 
about an actor who had rolled through five Academy Award-nominated performances 
in seven years -- "The Godfather" (1972), "Serpico" (1973), "The Godfather, 
Part II" (1974), "Dog Day Afternoon" (1975), " . . . And Justice for All" 
(1979) -- and co-starred in a 1973 Cannes Grand Prix winner ("Scarecrow") to 
boot. There was the popular, controversial "Scarface" (1983), followed by a 
successful Broadway revival of David Mamet's "American Buffalo." Yet, ever 
since the virtually nonexistent, $28-million dud "Revolution" (1985), Pacino 
has been in what you might call his John-Lennon-bread-baking phase. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, like Lennon upon his re-emergence, the 49-year-old Pacino still 
has his chops. His burnt-out "Sea of Love" detective, Frank Keller, is another 
of his quintessential New York cop characters, the man Frank Serpico might have 
become had he given in and stayed on the force 20 years, treading in a sea of 
booze. With John Goodman as his partner investigating the serial murders of 
personals-ad Casanovas, and Ellen Barkin as the suspect he falls for in a 
typically crackling script by Richard Price, Pacino is, as he puts it, "in and 
around territory I've been around before." 
</P>
<P>
Pacino, like Keller, has hit his own 20-year mark, dating from his movie debut 
in the minor drug drama "Me, Natalie" (1969). Pacino, like Keller, has had 
serious bouts with the bottle, and has known his way around the dark side of 
the street, losing friends to the needle. Pacino, like Keller, is one of the 
best at what he does, which still doesn't mitigate the angst around the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel I'm that close to that guy," Pacino insists. "You just try to 
feed into the part things in your life that 
</P>
<P>
coincide with the character you're playing. A guy like Frank, who doesn't have 
the love in his life, has the work. And now he's about to lose the work," since 
he's expected after 20 years to retire on half-pay. Pacino's take: "If you can 
still work, if you still enjoy the work, it's only time to retire when you no 
longer wanna do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess playing the part now, as opposed to playing it 10 years ago, I have a 
closer understanding, a more tactile understanding of the character," he says, 
"because of my age and I understand that situation he's in. I'll look at parts 
now sometimes, and I'll know it would have excited me to do that five years 
ago, and now another kind of thing will excite me. It really comes down to what 
you want to address at this point in your life -- the things you start to find 
are relevant to you." 
</P>
<P>
Pacino has that luxury. At the same time, like Hamlet, the Melancholoy Italian 
doesn't give the impression of someone who knows what he wants. "That's 
probably the reason I got into acting," he reflects. "So I don't have to think. 
I think the reason I act is for a relief from thinking." Yet even considering 
the leeway rightly accorded artists, Pacino's choices over the last few years 
have been puzzling. He's kept busy. He just hasn't kept busy with anything any 
of us can actually go see. 
</P>
<P>
There were workshop productions of "Crystal Clear," "National Anthems" and 
other plays, including a current Manhattan project he's not ready to talk 
about. There was "Julius Caesar" for Joseph Papp last year. There was 
"Carlito's Way," if you go by Elliot Kastner's lawsuit alleging that Pacino 
committed to the film last April for $4 million plus a profit percentage. And 
most 
</P>
<P>
time-consuming, there is "The Local Stigmatic," a play Pacino had starred in 
Off Broadway in 1969 then re-mounted in 1985 with director David Wheeler and 
the Theater Company of Boston to film a 50-minute movie version that may become 
his "Unfinished Symphony." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people relate to that kind of private work," he says. "Because 
(acting) is such a visible profession that if you're not real visible in it, 
they assume you're not working. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember back when everything was happening, '74, '75, doing ("The 
Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui") on stage and reading that the reason I'd gone 
back to the stage was that my movie career was waning! That's been the kind of 
ethos, the way in which theater's perceived, unfortunately. My big problem has 
been that I've been trying to ride both rails. And I can tell that some of my 
work has been affected by that. I wish I was able to have gone into both media 
with more focus." 
</P>
<P>
He's trying, and the $16-million "Sea of Love" required all the focus he could 
give it. Producer Bregman let the original director go days before shooting was 
to begin, bringing in Harold Becker ("The Onion Field," "The Boost") for a 
long, grueling shoot that lasted from about May through September of last year. 
Pacino did a cameo in Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy," playing Big Boy, "the 
world's largest dwarf." He dabbled with "Three Thousand," reading with Julia 
Roberts for the role being played by Richard Gere. And in November, he begins 
production on "The Godfather, Part III." "It's that movie to do, so you sorta 
gotta do it," he says smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I wish, in some ways, the government forced me to make a movie once 
a year," he adds, with a laugh. "There would be a sort of regularity, a kind of 
consistency in the output so that your movies don't become blown all out of 
proportion -- it turns a simple movie into an epic kind of thing, if you make 
them only every few years. I've decided not to go as long between them. The 
idea of going two years between pictures, I'd rather not." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, a few years of that might remind him why he slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was all happening to me," he says of his firecracker string in the 
'70s, "I don't think I was aware of it. I knew around me things were going on. 
But I kept trying to focus on the next play or movie I was gonna do. And when I 
looked up it was five years later." 
</P>
<P>
The thought brings him in mind of a story: 
</P>
<P>
"We were doing 'Richard III' in Philadelphia one winter, and first we're in 
this sort of marathon rehearsal and then playing night after night there. And I 
remember one day finally getting in the car to drive back to New York, and we 
stopped at a light and I looked out and thought, 'What are these people doing, 
they don't have coats on, they're just walking without a coat?' And my friend 
says, 'It's spring, Al.' "

ROGER MOORE AND TALIA SHIRE TAKE SEQUEL BREAK; 
</P>
<P>
THEY'RE SHOOTING A ROMANTIC COMEDY ON THE COAST OF MAINE

<TEXT>
<P>
Some captivities are a good deal more pleasant and endurable than others, but 
in the end all captivities begin to chafe at least a little. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since he launched his long run as television's The Saint, for example, 
Roger Moore has been the amply rewarded captive of his considerable gift for 
portraying an adventurous, romantic insouciance. The gift went on to serve him 
well through seven outings as James Bond. But after a while you do wonder, as 
Moore has, if there is not more to the acting life than the arched eyebrow and 
the amiable leer. 
</P>
<P>
Here on the rockbound coast of Maine, sacred to vacationing presidents past and 
current, Moore is enjoying a change of pace, playing a cynical bounder turned 
OK guy in a romantic comedy called "Bed and Breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
Talia Shire, who is producing the film with her husband Jack Schwartzman, has 
her own experience of captivity and she is similarly in quest of a change of 
pace in "Bed and Breakfast," playing the principal romantic lead opposite 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
It is as Rocky's wife that she is recognized and hailed as she walks around 
York, Biddeford Pool and the other locations where the film is being shot. 
Indeed there is "Rocky V" in her near future, and very likely (although neither 
she nor anyone is yet able to say for sure) there will be another outing for 
her brother Francis Coppola in his long-speculated-about "Godfather III." 
</P>
<P>
After "Bed and Breakfast" she will play a very spiritual nun in the Nicolas 
Roeg film of Brian Moore's novel "Cold Heaven." But for the moment she is out 
of the supporting mode and into a leading role. 
</P>
<P>
Like Moore's, her character undergoes the kind of transformation actors are 
always grateful to play. She is at first the embittered, withdrawn widow of a 
charismatic politician who was a public hero and a private heel and whose ghost 
she can't seem to exorcise, at least until Moore washes ashore. Then the whole 
and vibrant woman re-emerges. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Dewhurst, lately an Emmy nominee for "Murphy Brown," plays Shire's 
mother in "Bed and Breakfast," and she too is enjoying a change of pace from 
the strong but often formidably austere characters she has played on stage, as 
in the work of Eugene O'Neill, and in her relatively infrequent films. 
</P>
<P>
This time she is an outspoken, earthy grandmother in whom the sexual fires have 
not been banked and who enjoys a romp that might have given even Auntie Mame a 
momentary pause. 
</P>
<P>
The story, a first produced script by Cindy Myers, an American Film Institute 
graduate, has Moore as an English con man who has conned the wrong victims, 
been savagely beaten and leaped or fallen from a yacht. He's discovered 
half-dead amid the driftwood and seaweed on the beach of a failing 
bed-and-breakfast run by a grandmother, mother and daughter -- Dewhurst, Shire 
and Nina Siemaszko, a 19-year-old who played one of the children in "Tucker." 
Moore, not so subtly named Adam, turns the three women's lives and several 
others (including his own) upside down. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been fascinated by The Stranger who comes in and changes 
everybody's life," says the director, Robert Ellis Miller ("Reuben Reuben," 
"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter," "Any Wednesday"). "There's such a literature, 
from Dostoevsky forward and backward." 
</P>
<P>
On a hazy-bright, warm and muggy afternoon, Miller &amp; Company are shooting 
on a sloping street near the water's edge at Biddeford Pool, a lobster-fishing 
hamlet on a sheltered bay just off the Atlantic. It is a long tracking and 
dollying shot as Moore and the granddaughter, who has her own crush on the 
stranger, walk up the road to the corner, she full of questions about his 
mysterious past. 
</P>
<P>
The bad guys have not stopped looking for Moore, which makes for some nice 
cross-cut tension. Now, as the scene ends, Moore sees their classic red Porsche 
barreling down the street, and he slips away. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some unusual villains," Miller says; "young and well-dressed and very 
rich and very dangerous. The rich have a fearlessness that is very menacing." 
</P>
<P>
There is a sizable crowd of villagers in a great semi-circle behind the camera, 
learning the first great lesson about film- making, which is 
</P>
<P>
that it is extremely slow and tedious work both to watch and to do. The camera 
tracks are laid and carefully leveled. The camera moves tried and retried with 
the locally-recruited stand-ins, a college student, Darin Bunstad, from the 
University of Maine, an art teacher, Barbara Grieg, from Cape Neddick. 
</P>
<P>
The actors are called at last from their caravans. As Moore moves through the 
crowd, a woman says in a loud whisper, "That's Roger Moore!" "You mean he's 
still alive?" Moore asks, turning in mock surprise. 
</P>
<P>
He has not made a film since his seventh Bond, "A View to a Kill," four years 
ago. Earlier this year he startled everyone by agreeing to appear on stage as 
the romantic singing lead in Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Aspects of Love." 
</P>
<P>
"Andrew had heard me sing on the telly one night," Moore said over dinner in 
the York Harbor Inn. "It was a foolish bit with Dame Edna Everidge on the Barry 
Humphreys show, but Andrew said he knew I could do the musical. I began taking 
lessons and I convinced myself that I could do it too. 
</P>
<P>
"Then came the rehearsals. I found to my horror that there's a difference 
between singing by yourself and having to sing for the other singers around 
you, giving them a note when you haven't a clue yourself where the damned note 
is. It became a nightmare. Sleepless nights. Awful. And it's a wonderful show. 
If it hadn't been such great music I'd have done it." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's wife Luisa, who has joined him here with their three children, Deborah, 
Geoffrey and Christian, chimed in: "I think he still wishes he had." 
</P>
<P>
"The public can blame Andrew Lloyd Webber for having me inflicted on them 
again," Moore remarked cheerfully. Dropping out of the musical made it possible 
for Moore to do "Bed and Breakfast" and, he says in his most debonair way, to 
quell any dark rumors that he was retiring. In fact the film was rushed into 
production (after two years in preparation) to fit the few weeks Moore had free 
before he is scheduled to film a thriller, "Bulls Eye," with his pal Michael 
Caine, in England and Scotland, with Michael Winner directing. 
</P>
<P>
"Bulls oi-vey, Michael says," says Moore. Moore now carries his own fax machine 
with him everywhere, and he and Caine and a circle of other pals now exchange 
almost daily messages. Historians who have worried that the telephone was 
creating a terrible shortage of papers on which to base biographies and other 
interpretations of the past can take heart. The fax machine may even bring back 
the epistolary novel. 
</P>
<P>
An agent brought Jack Schwartzman the script that became "Bed and Breakfast" 
because the widow's role seemed ideal for Shire. "It was called 'Snakes' then, 
and the guy was a 40-year-old New York Italian crook," Schwartzman said during 
a lunch break at Biddeford Pool. That characterization didn't excite him but he 
and his wife agreed that the widow's part had great promise for Shire. 
</P>
<P>
The couple met Moore at a party and sent him the script as it was, asking him 
to imagine it rewritten for him. He liked it and the rewrites were done. "I 
wanted a change of pace; I needed a change of pace," Moore says. Then Moore 
elected to do the musical. "That was really meant to be a change of pace." The 
picture seemed indefinitely delayed, until Moore dis-elected to do the musical. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartzman, an entertainment lawyer before he went into production, and Shire 
have financed "Bed and Breakfast" themselves, raising part of the money by 
selling the foreign rights, but waiting until the film is finished to make a 
domestic distribution deal. Moore is partnered with them, and director Miller 
and other above-the-line principals are defering most of their salaries: 
"pooling our risks," Shire says, "against a share of the rewards." 
</P>
<P>
"Roger, Talia and I are the owners and financiers," Schwartzman says. "There's 
nobody we have to call every day and say, 'May we?' It's great for the 
director. There's no superstructure imposing its will from thousands of miles 
away." 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of film is no longer being programmed for the screen," Shire says. 
"There's a whole range of actors, actresses and directors who just aren't 
getting to do the kind of work they should be doing. The studios have a moral 
obligation to do a variety of films, but they're only making blockbusters." 
</P>
<P>
"Bed and Breakfast" will come in for less than $10 million. Schwartzman and 
Shire hope to have it ready for a possible Academy Award nominating run in 
December -- "if we really think there are two or three possible nominations in 
it," Schwartzman says. It will in all events open, very carefully, in the first 
quarter of 1990. "This isn't a slam dunk; you don't open on 1,500 screens." 
</P>
<P>
The captivity of the sequel, which has touched both Moore and Shire, is 
peculiar, and it really is a kind of imprisonment, inflicted by the audience 
(or by producers for whom repetition is the sincerest form of flattery). 
</P>
<P>
"I know; I'm a person who's been in sequels," Shire says. "People think you're 
being unfaithful if they see you in anything else. What you've got to do is 
find a role that helps the audience say, 'OK; we're going to relax and free 
you.' It can be maneuvered beautifully if you do it right." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Moore role, Shire says, 'He's able to come in as an archetype, the 
smooth, cynical charming crook, and emerge as a full-fledged hero. I think, and 
he thinks, it's an ideal role to make his audience relax and want to see what 
he'll do next." 
</P>
<P>
A production scout found a perfect, empty house on the ocean, near the end of a 
private road at York Beach, with the constant sound of buoy bells in the 
channel and the Cape Neddick lighthouse just off the next point. The house, of 
weathered shingle and field stone will, like the characters themselves, be 
transformed, from near-dilapidation to a bustling commercial enterprise, before 
the story is done. (Not for nothing is the Moore figure a con man.) 
</P>
<P>
But transformations are never simple. "We bought $3,000 worth of black-eyed 
Susans or whatever they were for the front lawn," Schwartzman says. "From 
ground level it looked like a whole field of daisies. Then we did a crane shot. 
From up high, all those flowers looked like a hair transplant that hadn't taken 
yet. We'll have to figure something else." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartzman and Shire have come off a couple of difficult productions. They did 
the maverick Bond film, "Never Say Never Again," with Sean Connery. It drew 
more process servers than customers. "Lion Heart," a period piece about the 
Children's Crusade, was test marketed in two cities and fared so ill that 
Warners will not release it theatrically at all in this country but go right to 
cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
But, as much as you can ever tell about a film in production, "Bed and 
Breakfast" feels good to all those involved. "If it works," Shire says, "others 
will be encouraged to try it this way, pooling the risks to share the rewards. 
Think what it could do for the business. Others will do the biggies as always. 
It's the small ones you have to fight for. 
</P>
<P>
"This script gives you such hope that love is available at any age," Shire 
says. "I think people want to hear that."

SCENES FROM THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD;

<P>
MEMORIES OF EATING ON FAIRFAX AVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For seven years, I lived in an apartment so close to Fairfax Avenue that I 
could open my living room windows and breathe in a full-course meal. The 
lightest southerly breeze would send in the peppery scent of Sichuan food 
stir-frying at Yung Hwa. Or if the wind blew from the northwest, the spicy 
aroma of falafels filled the room. From due west would come dessert: the thick, 
sweet fragrance of butter cookies baking at Canter's delicatessen. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a bad deal, even though opened windows also meant that less pleasant 
things would waft inside. If cooking food is what the Fairfax District smells 
like, its aural signature is a white noise made up of honking horns, screeching 
tires and loud conversation. This was the snarled dialogue fragment that once 
floated up from the street: "Red! They're gonna send you to the coo-coo house . 
. . " When I timidly peeked down to the sidewalk below, I saw two palsied, 
wrinkled women squaring off, one of whom had hair dyed the vibrating color of a 
cherry Popsicle. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, I left the din behind me, and moved into a sun-drenched 
place in a seriously serene area. When my mail comes through the slot and hits 
the tile floor it sounds like a sonic boom. Now I only think about the old 
neighborhood when I'm hungry, daydreaming of food within walking distance: of a 
fruit cup from Canter's delicatessen (crisp, 
</P>
<P>
juicy pieces of melon and pineapple tucked into a French jelly glass); or of a 
skinless grilled-chicken pita from the corner Middle Eastern food stand with 
the name that's embarrassing to say out loud (it's called Eat A Pita); or of a 
warm poppyseed bagel with cream cheese, shaved purple onions and a slice of 
ripe tomato from the Royal Bagel. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that for a single city area, Fairfax is unparalleled for cheap, 
expedient dining. (The peak luncheon experience in my new neighborhood was a 
pitiful sandwich -- a watery scoop of tuna, apples and raisins between two 
slices of razor-sharp rye toast -- which swiftly took up residence in my 
garbage can.) But what I really miss are the familiar faces, proving that food 
always tastes better when you like the person who is taking your money. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, eating at a neighborhood restaurant isn't about the food at all. It's 
about proximity and reliability and the relationship that develops between you 
and the proprietors. You watch their children grow, and you accustom yourself 
to their unique interior decorating schemes. (Who chose the translucent plastic 
panels of autumn leaves for the ceiling of Canter's? I've always wondered. And 
exactly what kind of mood were they going for?) Outsiders don't notice subtle 
menu changes -- pasta salad with roasted peanuts at Canter's, for example. But 
when you know a restaurant, you sense the hope owners invest in these weird 
little culinary brainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
I've always had the notion that once someone has seen you through a 
particularly bad case of the flu, they become a kind of a member of your 
extended family. This sickbed intimacy was initiated when I'd stagger into a 
Fairfax restaurant looking feverish and deranged. While I may have frightened 
the customers, the Canter's countermen -- surely the kindest fellows on the 
planet -- responded by passing over white Styrofoam tubs of chicken broth, 
assuring me that their special ratio of noodles to kasha to liquid would do the 
trick. Lily, the slim, quick-talking proprietor at Yung Hwa, had the most 
restorative tonic -- a cure-all that escapes me now, but had something to do 
with a large order of her silky won ton soup and endless cups of hot water with 
lemon. 
</P>
<P>
Being a repeat customer means feeling comfortable, even arrogant, in your 
knowledge of the little things. For example, the waitresses at Damiano Mr. 
Pizza have the life span of gnats; it's doubtful that you'll ever see your 
trembling server again, so tip generously. Eating this establishment's 
fuggazetta, a double-layered Argentine sauceless cheese-and-ham pizza, with a 
side of minced sauteed garlic, can be a near-religious experience. But 
purchasing a single pizza slice is a bad idea. It's a triangle of leftover pie, 
covered with a layer of not-quite-melted mozzarella, which shields your choice 
of topping like a rubbery pup tent. Mr. Pizza's Mitchell Kitay is what one 
hopes for in a young pizzeria owner: He's friendly, streetwise and -- when he 
isn't pitching his mother's homemade cheesecake or his limousine service -- 
capable of passing on startling information about the neighborhood. It was he, 
after all, who gently explained to me years ago that, no, my two neighbors were 
not nurses, but were employed in a far more lucrative branch of the human 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Back when I first moved into the neighborhood, Eat A Pita used to be a garden 
shed-sized place called Me &amp; Me. ("What does the name mean?" I once asked 
its muscular Israeli short-order cook. He told me, "You and you." Oh.) Several 
years ago, actress Julie Newmar took over the property -- she owns the land 
parcel -- and began busily retrofitting it in a style that manages to salute 
both architect Frank Gehry and "Miami Vice." Around the original structure 
they've put up bars, gratings, a roofed 
</P>
<P>
patio, picnic tables and space heaters -- most of which have been dipped in 
pink or turquoise paint. The food is still satisfying, and even 
cleaner-tasting: smoky schwarma, green salad with feta and firm Greek olives, 
garlicky baba ghanoouj, parslied rice steamed in a chicken stock, and 
astringent, marinated cold turnips stained magenta from soaking in beet juice. 
All this is consumed in the small piazza, with the nasal wail of Tel Aviv pop 
music blaring, near an intersection that features the three items necessary to 
insure spontaneous street theater: a bus stop, a high school, and a traffic 
light. Anything can happen at this corner . . . and has. Once, when I was 
heading homeward, I spotted a corpulent woman standing calmly at the ordering 
counter, dressed only in an extra-large brassiere and panty-girdle. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, when I drove through the area, it looked grubbier, more 
graffiti-scrawled. I couldn't decide if the street had begun to sag or if 
absence makes the eyes see clearly. But what remained the same were the 
shuffling pedestrians: Fairfax is still the only neighborhood where the elderly 
own the sidewalks. And Canter's is their eating hall. It's not just that it's 
open 24 hours or that it serves homey dishes -- soft blintzes, wizened baked 
apples. There's a sense of democracy that prevails there -- everyone has to 
plead to place their order. It sums up the best of what Fairfax has to offer. 
In my younger days, when three a.m. still seemed a perfectly reasonable time to 
go on a bagel run, I wandered into Canter's and was greeted by this vision: a 
dining room full of customers wearing feathered Indian headbands. And it wasn't 
only eccentric, pale-skinned rockers wearing the paper hats. So were old men 
dressed in rumpled outfits of plaid and stripes, wearing their party hats with 
looks of shy pride. It was one of the waitresses' birthday, I was told. 
Everyone wanted to help celebrate.

GRAND CENTRAL STATION; 
</P>
<P>
NEARLY 900 PUPILS CATCH THE BUS AT GRANT ELEMENTARY FOR RIDE TO OTHER SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Most students in the Los Angeles school district began a new year last week at 
schools within walking distance of their homes. But for almost 900 children 
living near Grant Elementary School in Hollywood, Tuesday was the start of a 
year of getting to Grant about 7 a.m., only to board buses that go as far as 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the gray, cool dawn, the sidewalk along Harold Way near Wilton Place was 
packed with parents, searching for the correct bus in the 40-bus fleet and 
telling their children -- some as young as 6 -- in Armenian, Spanish and 
English to behave. Signs on utility poles listed the destination schools -- 
Sherman Oaks, Coliseum, Paseo Del Rey, Woodland Hills, 19 schools in all -- 
with route numbers and times. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Campos Amaya, 6, sobbed as school aides, sounding like conductors, 
called out destinations: "Anybody else for Dorris Place?" 
</P>
<P>
Nineth Amaya lifted her red-eyed daughter onto the bus steps and watched 
mournfully as the bus pulled out, headed for Dorris Place School near Elysian 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not used to . . . the bus," Nineth Amaya said. "It's her first time -- 
she's nervous. I'm nervous, too." 
</P>
<P>
Nervousness and confusion, in fact, were the order of the day. For Heline 
Keshishyan and her son, sixth-grader Oganes Kostikyan, finding the 7:45 a.m. 
Valley View School bus was a substantial challenge, considering that they had 
been sent a busing form with an incorrect pickup point and departure time. 
Earlier, Keshishyan had been sent a letter from another school inviting her to 
an orientation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She's Nervous' 
</P>
<P>
Situated in a crowded neighborhood that is home to many recent immigrants, 
Grant Elementary is one of the most -- if not the most -- crowded schools in 
the Los Angeles Unified School District. The school has a capacity of 750 
children, and the neighborhood contains more than twice that number. District 
officials said they knew of no other school that buses out more children than 
it keeps. 
</P>
<P>
Of the district's 600 schools, it also has the most crowded playground, said 
Dean Miyazaki, a district facilities project manager. If all the Grant students 
were on the playground at once, they "couldn't play all the various games that 
require space -- hopscotch, kickball, tetherball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Children who enter Grant as kindergartners get to stay there through sixth 
grade, but most older children who move into the neighborhood must be bused to 
places such as Playa del Rey, Bel-Air, the Crenshaw area and the San Fernando 
Valley. In some families, this means that siblings are split up, the younger 
ones at Grant and the older ones on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the number bused has risen from 800 children to about 
900, Principal Beverly Neu said. The result is a Grand Central Station outside 
the school every morning and afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The school, near Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue, offers an extreme 
example of the problems encountered by dozens of schools in inner-city 
neighborhoods, which have grown crowded because of housing development, 
immigration and rising birthrates. Yet these areas -- Hollywood, the Wilshire 
corridor, South-Central, South Gate and Bell -- also have a scarcity of 
available land. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few miles away from Grant on Wilshire Boulevard, the district wants to 
buy the closed Ambassador Hotel, considered one of the few chunks of land in 
the central city where a new school could be built without having to level a 
neighborhood. But commercial developers also have their eyes on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The district tries to handle the swell of students by busing; expanding the 
capacity of schools, such as Grant, by operating them on a year-round schedule; 
erecting portable classrooms, and using community college facilities. This 
year, the district will bus more than 20,000 students from overcrowded campuses 
to schools with more room, at a cost of $1,176 per student. 
</P>
<P>
A partial solution for the crowding at Grant Elementary is in the works. A 
14-classroom building and enlarged playground for Grant are under construction 
and will be finished in May. Even then, Grant will have to remain on a 
year-round schedule, and it will still be necessary to bus at least 400 
children to other schools. 
</P>
<P>
Over its 86-year history, the student body at Grant has evolved from an 
American-born, Anglo one to a largely foreign-born, Armenian and Latino one. 
Grant has bilingual Spanish and bilingual Armenian classes, but its students 
speak 15 other languages as well, including Farsi, Vietnamese, Romanian, Korean 
and Amharic. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood has been "getting immigrants from whatever country the U.S. was 
allowing them to come from," said Anne Baillie, who has taught at Grant since 
the late '60s. In her classroom, Baillie and an Armenian aide juggle 30 third- 
and fourth-graders, mostly Armenian and other immigrants, who read at levels 
ranging from "The cat runs to Ana" to "Carl decided to take dance classes and 
concentrate on learning ballet." 
</P>
<P>
The student body is also highly mobile. Two hundred new kindergartners start 
each year at Grant. By the time they reach the sixth grade, said Mariana 
Roberts, adviser of bilingual programs at Grant, three-quarters of them will 
have moved away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moving Up and Out 
</P>
<P>
She said the impermanence comes with the neighborhood. Attracted by the 
relatively low rents, immigrants consider Hollywood a port of entry. But the 
seedy motels, adult bookstores and liquor stores on Hollywood Boulevard, a 
block away from the school, are all the incentive most need to try to move up 
and out. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say drug dealers and users and other unsavory characters wander the 
area. Will Pettit, 28, who has lived a few doors down from Grant for five 
years, said, "If I (were) a child, I'd hate to have to come here to go to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
But, with the apartment construction frenzy in the neighborhood, people will 
continue to pour in, residents and school administrators say. Three apartment 
buildings with more than 200 units are going up within a block of the school. 
And scattered vacant houses in the neighborhood, their windows boarded up and 
lawns littered with weeds and broken bottles, are probable sites for yet more 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
School district demographers expect that by 1993, the number of elementary-age 
children living within Grant's enrollment boundaries will rise by nearly 300. 
</P>
<P>
"We see it just going on up, right off the end," said Gordon Wohlers, 
administrator of the district's priority housing program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old Problem 
</P>
<P>
The burgeoning number of children is not new. Before 1980, Grant was on double 
sessions, teaching half of the students in the morning and half in the 
afternoon. In 1980, it started busing and operating year-round. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1985, the district began searching for expansion sites for Grant, 
which was occupying half of a block at Wilton Place and Harold Way. It would 
take four years of environmental reports, meetings and hearings before the rest 
of the block, with 32 households, was cleared for the school expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The ground breaking for the classrooms and playground was in May. The project, 
mostly funded through state bonds, is costing $3.25 million to buy the 
residents' land and homes and cover their relocation expenses and $1.9 million 
for construction. 
</P>
<P>
It was a long and bitter process that has left residents and school district 
officials angry at each other -- and frustrated that the finished building will 
do so little to relieve overcrowding and reduce the need for busing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'What Buttons You Push' 
</P>
<P>
The owners and tenants "had a good sense of what buttons you push to get your 
voice heard in the public arena, and they used that arena very effectively," 
said Bob Niccum, the district's real estate director. 
</P>
<P>
District officials acted "like Baby Huey," replied Sandy Melvoin, one of the 
residents displaced by the expansion. "They come out . . . destroy everything 
around them, and they did not solve their problems," said Melvoin, who was 
chairwoman of the Carlton Way/Harold Way Neighborhood Assn. and who rented one 
of the houses targeted for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
The association of 90 homeowners and tenants argued that the endangered homes, 
some built in the early 1900s, were essential to the neighborhood's character 
and could be a basis for gentrifying Hollywood, Melvoin said. Seven of the 
houses, because of their age and architecture, were recognized as historically 
significant structures by the city, but did not fall into a category that was 
protected from demolition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sad to Watch' 
</P>
<P>
Residents started vacating the block in April, 1987. Melvoin, who moved out in 
September 1988, among the last to leave, said it was "sad to watch them go one 
by one." 
</P>
<P>
Another displaced resident, Mary Saatjian, who with her parents co-owned a big 
1914 Dutch Colonial house that was a neighborhood landmark, acknowledged 
Grant's need to expand, but said the compensation "was not adequate." Her 
family is still entangled in a lawsuit with the district over the value of the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all very naive," Saatjian said of the Carlton residents. "Some people 
didn't realize the value of property in Hollywood and just accepted the 
(district's) offer." 
</P>
<P>
What the district should have done, Melvoin says, is build another school 
elsewhere. The association had suggested alternative sites, including vacant 
commercial lots and buildings nearby. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Other Site 
</P>
<P>
Project manager Miyazaki replies that the district tried to do so for years 
before finally abandoning the attempt two years ago. "We were literally unable 
to find a site" that would not displace a large number of people and businesses 
and that was not at a busy intersection, which would be unsafe for children, he 
said. Buying "a whole block for a new school, in that area, I'd say is 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
As the homes on the block were swept away, so was most of the opposition to the 
expansion. "They got what they wanted," says Melvoin, who now lives in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining neighbors grumble about the bulldozing and hammering, but support 
the expansion in the name of education. "It's for the kids, education, for the 
(betterment) of the country," said Jimmy Paredes, 25, who has lived on Wilton 
Place across from Grant for four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel that great about those people having to move, but I feel good 
about the school -- it's needed," said Manuel Vasquez, 34, who for three years 
has managed a 60-year-old apartment building on Carlton Street across from the 
site. "You never can have it all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'There's No Choice' 
</P>
<P>
At the Harold Way depot, many seemed resigned to the busing. 
</P>
<P>
Parent Mike Khachikyan, who came to the United States nine years ago, was 
helping answer the questions of newer Armenian immigrants. "In our country, 
every small place, (has) schools and (children in the area) go to that school," 
he said. "(I) explain to them, there's no choice (here)." 
</P>
<P>
But the busing carries a host of anxieties and unknowns. "It is not good for 
me," sighed Heline Keshishyan, saying she worries every day whether the bus 
will be late or will run into a disaster. Exactly where Valley View, her son's 
school, is, she doesn't know. Last year she spoke to the teachers over the 
phone, and this year she wants to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
The parents have high hopes for the school expansion. Khachikyan said his sons, 
aged 9 and 13, have complained about being bullied by some older Latino boys at 
Dorris Place Elementary, where they are bused. If they could go to Grant, he 
said, "I think (it would be) different, because a lot of Armenians are . . . 
here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Sons Together 
</P>
<P>
Keshishyan hopes the expansion will unite her two sons. Grant's policy of 
enrolling the kindergartners but busing older children has meant that 
sixth-grade Oganes goes to Valley View, on the traditional school calendar with 
a long summer vacation, although her first-grade boy Vahe is at Grant, on a 
year-round schedule with four short breaks throughout the year. She hopes there 
will be room for Oganes at Grant. If not, she said, when Vahe is older, she may 
put him on the Valley View bus so the brothers can be together. 
</P>
<P>
"We need the school (expansion) here. It (will be) much better," said 
Khachikyan. "It's not going to be like this," he said, motioning at the swarms 
of parents and kids and shouting above the roar of the buses. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the addition cannot fit all the students, he paused and 
said, "I don't know, maybe we're going to be lucky."

STAR, AT 59 YEARS OLD, COMES OF AGE

Speaking of "Anything Goes," now -- as the show's run winds up at the Center 
and we won't be accused of trying to put a damper on ticket sales -- the truth 
can be told. 
</P>
<P>
Before the musical's opening, Mitzi Gaynor blew her "blond" top and refused to 
give an interview to The Times because in a previous story, staff writer Jan 
Herman had the audacity to print her age (59). 
</P>
<P>
He added, right in the same sentence, that she looks "as hot as anyone had a 
right to look at her (or any) age." But still, Mitzi hadn't liked that one bit, 
and she went into a rage all over again when she was told that Herman, 48, was 
on the phone to talk about "Anything Goes," 55, at the Center, 3. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about the show? Talk about her work, her goals as a performer, her 
approach to her craft? Not with him! HE told people HOW OLD I AM!

This is exactly the sort of me-me-me-me, what's-art-got-to-do-with-it (though 
one does hesitate to use the words "art" and "Mitzi Gaynor" in the same 
breath), oh-so-showbizy tripe that one would hope to avoid these days, 
especially in dealing with productions brought in by a place such as the Center 
-- which could, and should, be a champion of work that is innovative and, if 
nothing else, serious and purposeful. 
</P>
<P>
The Center should not, I think, be just another stop for some road show whose 
principals still adhere to the Hedda Hopper school of mug-a-lot, hoof-a-lot and 
never-let-em-know-how-old-you-are.

RANDY LEWIS: FOR POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT, YOU'LL HAVE TO GO OFF CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
PATRONS ARE STUCK WITH TIRED OLD SHOWS THAT FEATURE OLDER, MORE TIRED 
PERFORMERS

When the Orange County Performing Arts Center opened three years ago this 
month, architecture critics and most Center-goers stood in awe of the 
building's boldly innovative, non-traditional design. 
</P>
<P>
But with the notable exception of numerous first-rank ballet groups, most of 
the Center's own presentations would have been served just fine by four plywood 
walls, an old blanket for a curtain and plastic, fold-out chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who hoped the Center's bill of fare would offer anything 
approaching the range and depth found at other performing arts complexes around 
the country will have to keep waiting. 
</P>
<P>
For ballet lovers, things could hardly be better, especially for so young an 
operation. In the first year, we got the only West Coast appearance of the New 
York City Ballet. Last month, we got the exclusive on the vaunted Kirov Ballet. 
And next year, though Center officials haven't officially announced it, we 
should see the Royal Ballet of Great Britain in what figures to be its only 
pirouette west of the Mississip. 
</P>
<P>
So if your tastes run to dance and nothing else, everything's coming up tutus. 
</P>
<P>
If only the choices in terms of popular entertainment were quite so, well, 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
This week's performances of "Anything Goes" put a wrap on the Center's 1988-89 
Broadway season, with Mitzi Gaynor attempting to revive (or should we say 
resuscitate?) a role in a 55-year-old musical that she played on screen 33 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
We also have been treated to Topol playing "Fiddler on the Roof" for the 
umpteenth-thousandth time of his one-role career; Tyne Daly in a revival of 
"Gypsy" (another musical nearly old enough to run for President); "Elvis: A 
Musical Celebration," a pandering show that had as much to do with rock 'n' 
roll as Pat Sajak has to do with incisive wit, and the one (count it) one 
remotely new and thoughtful product, Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods." 
</P>
<P>
The Center also has blessed us with such middle-of-the-road entertainers as Vic 
Damone and Diahann Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
The Center largely owes its existence to the contributions of the Segerstrom 
family, who also commissioned the nearby Noguchi sculpture garden, which 
includes a rock sculpture called "The Spirit of the Lima Bean." 
</P>
<P>
In terms of its pop bookings, the Center has been calling often and loudly on 
"The Spirit of the Has-Been." 
</P>
<P>
Look around the country and see how other facilities are mixing pop culture 
with the high arts. The Kennedy Center in Washington (former stomping grounds 
of O.C. Performing Arts Center President Thomas R. Kendrick, by the way), 
recently booked soul-music queen Aretha Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky Center for the Arts in Louisville this summer continued its 
mall-theater series of "Lonesome Pine Specials" -- performances that would fit 
neatly into the Center's 299-seat Founders Hall theater -- with bluegrass whiz 
David Grisman, the offbeat a cappella harmonizing of the Bobs and New Orleans 
R&amp;B great Irma Thomas, among others. 
</P>
<P>
The Center is attempting to better utilize Founders Hall, but so far we've had 
three (count 'em, three) public concerts there in as many years, only one of 
which, in the Center's view, has warranted even a penny's worth of advertising 
or promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home, on Thursday, veteran French jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli 
will play Royce Hall at UCLA's Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Pop Renaissance man David Byrne is bringing his heady new musical/theatrical 
act to the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles next month. (I can hear the 
conversation in the Center board room now: "David Byrne -- isn't he that guy 
who used to be married to Meredith Baxter?") 
</P>
<P>
The lavish Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena has not only lined up loads of 
orchestras, ballet companies and chamber groups for its 1989-90 season, but is 
also managing to find room for admirable cultural diversity with such bookings 
as the sublime Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Choir, legendary 
country pianist Floyd Cramer, the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Band and the Hungarian 
State Folk Ensemble. (At least the Hungarian group will make it to Orange 
County; we can thank the Orange County Philharmonic Society for that.) 
</P>
<P>
What do we get? Mitzi Gaynor. 
</P>
<P>
The rub is that when you ask Center officials why they don't offer more, and 
better, in the way of popular entertainment, they reassert their high-minded 
devotion to what they define as "the four major disciplines: ballet, symphonic 
music, opera and Broadway musicals." 
</P>
<P>
(Hmmm. Ex-"Happy Days" stars Tom Bosley and Donny Most mugging their way 
through a limp revival of "Strike Up the Band?" Vic Damone cracking crude jokes 
about the size of his wife's breasts?) 
</P>
<P>
Yet, quiz them about the retread musicals and persona non talent singers they 
line up, and they'll tell you: 
</P>
<P>
"We're just responding to what the public wants." 
</P>
<P>
If this is what the people want, I have a few ideas that should go over great: 
How about Mickey Rooney in a revival of "Andy Hardy's Face Breaks Out?" Or 
perhaps a live version of "Great Balls of Fire" with Dennis Quaid aping Jerry 
Lee Lewis? (By God, let's not get the real thing if there's any way to simulate 
it.) 
</P>
<P>
Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery. But originality is still the 
sincerest form of art.

SMALL PLANES CATCH FLAK IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The near-collision over Newport Beach between a small plane and a Continental 
Airlines jet carrying 132 passengers on June 30 was Edwin C. Hall's call to 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
An air traffic controller in the tower at John Wayne Airport had told the pilot 
of the Beechcraft Bonanza to turn left after taking off. The pilot turned right 
instead, crossing within 100 feet of the Boeing 737, which had taken off just 
after the Beechcraft. Quick evasive action by the Continental pilot prevented 
what Airport Manager George Rebella describes as "my worst nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
The outspoken Hall, a former general aviation pilot who lives under the John 
Wayne flight path and who complains frequently about airport noise, quickly 
turned his neighborhood newsletter into a anti-aircraft weapon. Small planes 
are "self-serving, extravagant assault toys" that "operate over our communities 
in a life-threatening manner," he says. "Unless they reshuffle the deck out 
there, the Board of Supervisors has a responsibility to ultimately disallow all 
general-aviation-type aircraft from John Wayne Airport." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Accident Waiting to Happen' 
</P>
<P>
Hall is not alone in his opinion. "It's just an accident waiting to happen," 
says Carlyle H. Levinson of the Bluff Homeowners Assn. in Newport Beach in 
reference to the mix of small planes and big jets flying into and out of John 
Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about the threat to homeowners' safety increased this week after a 
Fullerton-based single-engine Cessna 152 with an instructor and student pilot 
aboard crashed into a Buena Park residential area Wednesday, prompting that 
city's mayor to demand restrictions at Fullerton Municipal Airport. 
</P>
<P>
And only two hours after the Buena Park crash, a twin-turboprop Rockwell 
Commander on its way to John Wayne had to make an emergency landing in the 
Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fears and the criticism, however, county officials have no plans to 
ban small aircraft at John Wayne. In fact, the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors has hired the consulting firm of Kennedy/Jencks/Chilton Inc. of 
Irvine to prepare a master plan, due in April, for the continued use of general 
aviation there for at least through the next two decades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Ratio of Small Planes 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne has the highest proportion -- 83.4% -- of general aviation 
operations as a percentage of the total than any major airport with the same or 
greater airline passenger volume. 
</P>
<P>
One experienced air traffic controller calls the job at John Wayne the most 
demanding he has seen, and an airline pilot says the skies over the airport 
push the limits of safety. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such concerns, aviation experts cite the lack of a "reliever" airport 
for general aviation in Orange County, the clout of private pilots and the 
airfield's colorful history as home to some of the famous early barnstormers 
and movie stunt fliers. 
</P>
<P>
Says Rebella, John Wayne Airport's manager: "Some (general aviation) people are 
a pain in the ass, but you find those everywhere. Yes, somebody is going to be 
somewhere where they're not supposed to be, and there will be a major crash. 
People are human and they make mistakes. . . . But I don't go out every day and 
say to those folks (homeowners) that it didn't happen, so they must be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Just because there might be a crash on the freeway, Rebella adds, "you don't 
close the freeway down." 
</P>
<P>
The latest fatal air crash at John Wayne occurred in March, when five members 
of a Canadian family died in Newport Beach when their Piper Aerostar crashed 
shortly after taking off from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"If the federal government has invested funds in a public aviation facility, by 
law that facility must be open to all types of aircraft," says James J. 
Wiggins, manager of the Federal Aviation Administration's regional planning and 
programs branch in Los Angeles. "They all help pay for the facilities. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne Airport would lose several million dollars a year in federal funding 
if it discouraged any type of aircraft, Wiggins said, because discrimination is 
a violation of federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1983 and 1988, the airport received $5.8 million in federal grants. In 
the 1988-89 fiscal year alone, the airport received slightly over $8 million, 
mostly because of the current airport expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
747 General Aviation Planes 
</P>
<P>
There are currently 747 general aviation planes at John Wayne, and they range 
from the smallest Cessna to the large Gulfstream corporate jets. In fact, the 
airfield is so popular with aircraft owners that there is a five-year waiting 
list for tie-down space. 
</P>
<P>
Through aircraft tie-down fees, hangar leases, wash-and-wax and fueling 
charges, general aviation accounted for $2.03 million, or 9.18% of John Wayne 
Airport's 1988 operating revenue of $22.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a high percentage of our revenue," Rebella said. "The problem with 
general aviation is that if you allow it to run the test of the free 
marketplace, it couldn't survive at any of the major airports because the 
commercial air carriers have so much money . . . that they could basically 
price general aviation out" and buy up all the ground and hangar leases. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why the Board of Supervisors has protected general aviation," Rebella 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley agrees, citing a commitment the board made to 
small plane owners when plans were formulated for the $50-million passenger 
terminal now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
General aviation has declined drastically at other major airports. At Los 
Angeles International and others, the decline was because, in part, commercial 
air carriers outbid all others for leases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Factors 
</P>
<P>
But there have been other factors contributing to the decline of general 
aviation at LAX and at other airports. One is small aircraft pilots' wish to 
avoid the congestion known as "stacking," in which planes are lined up to land 
or take off. 
</P>
<P>
"The small plane driver doesn't want to get mixed in with that mess," the FAA's 
Wiggins says, "so they moved to smaller airports in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Some airports, including National in Washington, discourage private aircraft 
operators by requiring minimum 24-hour advance reservations for 
instrument-aided landings, a practice imposed by the FAA despite its 
anti-discrimination policies. 
</P>
<P>
FAA officials say such "flow control" measures are adopted only rarely, when an 
airport is completely "saturated" with air traffic and cannot handle any more. 
John Wayne Airport has never approached its theoretical capacity for takeoffs 
and landings, even though there are morning and late afternoon periods of 
severe congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Proctor, a Santa Ana lawyer and county airport commissioner who keeps a 
Cessna at John Wayne, says that, because of what has happened elsewhere, he 
would like to see the new master plan for general aviation be something that 
would protect general aviation. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the history of major airports, the disappearance of (general 
aviation) just happens, slowly," he said. "It happens because nobody's paying 
attention, and they let it happen. It creeps up on you." 
</P>
<P>
Proctor says that the ultimate solution would be for aircraft owners to band 
together and raise the money necessary to build a small alternative airfield, 
but he quickly adds: "I'm a very small voice in the woods on that issue." 
</P>
<P>
Rebella says the safety problems are greatly exaggerated in the news media and 
that people such as Ed Hall often make irresponsible, baseless accusations. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Rebella adds, "the FAA has been cracking down" on pilots who make 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
But the FAA's own figures tell a different story. So far this year, there have 
been fewer disciplinary actions taken against errant pilots than at this time 
last year, and the total number dropped to 4,212 in 1988 from 4,437 in 1987. In 
addition, the number of suspensions -- the FAA's toughest sanction -- has 
fallen to a scant 133 so far this year. The number for all of 1988 was 1,082, 
and for all of 1987 it was 1,697. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say they do not know the reason behind the drop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Mixed Feelings' 
</P>
<P>
However, commercial pilots such as United Airlines' Dick Russell say they take 
extra precautions around John Wayne Airport because of general aviation. "The 
issue is that there is a disaster there just waiting to happen. Right now, it's 
bordering on the edge of not being safe. But we have mixed feelings on the 
issue, because many of us, like myself, are also general aviation pilots." 
</P>
<P>
Russell, a Los Angeles member of the Air Line Pilots Assn. air safety 
committee, flies in and out of John Wayne continually. Russell owns several 
small planes, but they are based at Van Nuys Airport, which does not serve 
commercial airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"The mix of small planes and airliners at John Wayne is unusual for an airport 
as busy as John Wayne, but you have to remember that it was always a general 
aviation airport. It should never have been made a commercial airport. . . . 
There isn't enough space out there to adequately handle commercial airline 
needs, so the small airplanes do get in the way. But they were there first." 
</P>
<P>
Some jetliners take off at such a steep angle, Russell said, that pilots cannot 
see small airplanes directly in front of them. Those pilots, Russell said, must 
rely on radar and air traffic controllers to protect them and their passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA's Tom Rea, who was manager of the John Wayne air traffic control tower 
from April, 1988 to April, 1989, says the high number of small aircraft is "a 
major problem at John Wayne Airport because we have only two runways." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tight Quarters' 
</P>
<P>
"We try to isolate the two," Rea said of general aviation and commercial craft, 
"but it's extremely tight quarters out there. The aircraft of one type must 
cross the runway of the opposing traffic. From an air traffic control point of 
view, it's one of the most demanding situations I've encountered anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Rea, who now serves as deputy air traffic control manager at the Coast Terminal 
Radar Approach Control Center, the FAA's regional facility in El Toro, added: 
"You have many pilots in smaller aircraft who are not only student fliers but 
also low flight-time pilots. When you have an air carrier pilot with thousands 
of hours and a general aviation pilot with just a hundred hours, there's a big 
difference in experience levels. 
</P>
<P>
"That comparison meets a lot of opposition from the (general aviation) 
community. And John Wayne has one of the most cohesive general aviation 
communities I've ever seen. The problem is that Orange County is Custer's Last 
Stand for general aviation." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, two years ago local pilots formed the Orange County Airport Assn. to 
"counter" the "growing countywide trend of hostility and intolerance toward 
general aviation," according to the membership recruitment brochure for the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Don Miller, vice president of the group, says the public -- and government -- 
simply misunderstand general aviation. "We are not all recreational fliers," he 
says. "We contribute to the community, and we pay our own way." 
</P>
<P>
To promote general aviation, the Orange County Airport Assn. brought John L. 
Baker, president of the 300,000-member Aircraft Owners &amp; Pilots Assn., 
which is based in Maryland, to Orange County for a major speech on June 16. 
</P>
<P>
The cries to close various airports to general aviation are "clearly a 
manifestation of the 'don't just sit there, do something -- even if it's wrong' 
syndrome," Baker told several hundred pilots at a luncheon in Irvine. "General 
aviation provides air service from over 14,000 airports in the country while 
flying five times as many hours annually as the airlines." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said general aviation provides on-demand air taxis, crop dusting, 
emergency medical and so-called mercy flights, small parcel and canceled check 
deliveries, search and rescue, aerial pipeline safety inspections and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying problem, Aircraft Owners &amp; Pilots Assn. officials say, is 
that the number of non-private landing strips has shrunk 20% since 1969 and 
that airports such as John Wayne -- once considered a "reliever" airport for 
Los Angeles International -- now need their own "relievers." 
</P>
<P>
There isn't any place else to go that's convenient, Rebella says. Meadowlark 
Airport in Huntington Beach closed this month, eliminating 150 aircraft 
tie-down spaces. And although Fullerton has spaces available, people who live 
near it are seeking to have it shut down. 
</P>
<P>
In January, FAA officials say, a new air safety zone will be created around 
John Wayne Airport that will require general aviation pilots to be in contact 
with air traffic controllers when they are within certain altitude ranges and 
distances from the airfield. 
</P>
<P>
That action, along with the installation of collision avoidance systems by the 
airlines during the next few years, will make the skies safer, Rebella says. 
</P>
<P>
But Rebella acknowledges that these things will not, altogether, assure 100% 
safety. Someday, he said, a major mid-air collision near John Wayne Airport 
will occur, and people will be second-guessing him. 
</P>
<P>
And what will he tell homeowners such as Ed Hall? 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't know what to say," Rebella says. ". . .You just try to operate as 
safely as you can." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should have to be kicked out of any place, but this is a problem that 
people have to wake up to," Hall said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, four planes have gone down" in Southern California in "just in the 
last four days."

WORRY OVER COLLEGE COSTS RISING ALONG WITH FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nearly all Orange County parents believe that a college education is critical 
to career success for their children, but fewer than half feel confident that 
they will be able to afford it, according to a Times Orange County poll. 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that such a highly educated population -- 41% of adult 
Orange County residents have four-year degrees, contrasted with 16% nationwide 
-- place a premium on learning. But even among the more affluent -- those whose 
household income exceeds $60,000 -- more than 40% expressed doubts that they 
would be able to pay the bills, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I read says college costs are rising dramatically," said Robert 
Swenson, a stockbroker who lives in San Juan Capistrano. "We should be able to 
educate our kids, but it will be tough, especially if they go to grad school. 
It will involve sacrifices for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Swenson and his wife, Yolanda, both UCLA graduates, are well-off by most 
standards: Their income far exceeds the county median of $45,000, and they have 
substantial equity in a home they bought in 1977. They also have two bright 
children -- Robert, 10, who talks about becoming a doctor, and Stephanie, 7. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of juggling around assets or hitting a few investment home 
runs," Robert Swenson said. "It's likely our children will go to a public 
university, and more likely they will attend a year of junior college or even 
two years. They're both very good students, and we're hoping they will get 
scholarships somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Such worries have increased along with annual tuition increases, according to 
Orange County parents who were surveyed Aug. 6 through 8 in the poll, conducted 
by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of attending a four-year college or university this fall in the United 
States will increase an average of 7% for public institutions and 9% for 
private schools, outpacing inflation for the ninth consecutive year, according 
to the College Board. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the average tuition for private colleges and universities will 
reach $8,737 for the 1989-90 academic year, the board estimates. At public 
institutions, the average tuition will rise to $1,694. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Concern' 
</P>
<P>
At public universities in Orange County, the total for tuition and other fees 
for the 1989-90 school year will range from $922 at Cal State Fullerton to 
$1,828 at UC Irvine. At Chapman College, a private liberal arts institution in 
Orange, tuition and fees will total $11,595 for the academic year. Community 
colleges, which have a $100-a-year tuition cap, remain a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
"The poll suggests there is great concern about the escalating costs of a 
college education," Baldassare said. "There is a perception that costs are high 
and could go higher." 
</P>
<P>
The astronomical price of housing in Orange County -- the median price for a 
home was $255,000 in July, and only 9% of families in the county had income 
sufficient to buy at that price -- undoubtedly figures into the financing 
equation, Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
"Aside from our unique characteristics of high levels of education and high 
income, we also have high housing costs," he said. "The results suggest it is 
difficult for many people to make the level of commitment" to college 
educations for their children "they feel is necessary in a community with such 
high housing costs." 
</P>
<P>
The large percentage of parents reporting that they have begun saving ahead of 
time for their children's education is another indication of concern about 
rising college costs, Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Couple Started Trust Funds 
</P>
<P>
Two out of three parents polled said they are putting money aside today. Among 
the parents who are themselves college graduates, the ratio was nearly three 
out of four. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a college education is very important," said Karen Arndt of 
Westminster, who was among the 90% of all respondents who rated a college 
degree as critical to success. "You can get a better job with a better 
education. That's what I keep telling my children." 
</P>
<P>
Arndt and her husband, Craig, say they are "not likely" to be able to afford 
the college educations they want for their son, Chris, 12, and their daughter, 
Andrea, 4. Nevertheless, the couple has established trust funds toward that 
end. Karen Arndt is not now employed; her husband works as a laborer. Both are 
high school graduates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's awfully expensive to put a child through college, so we've been putting 
money away since our oldest was a baby," she said. "I hope both of the children 
will go to college. We want them to have the best life possible." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the dream of owning a home has been put aside for the Arndt family, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're renting right now," Arndt said. "We still haven't been able to afford a 
house, and I don't know if we ever will in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Will Be a Struggle' 
</P>
<P>
Linda Heitkamp of Garden Grove also fears that she and her husband will not be 
able to put their two children -- Jenae, 10, and Gina, 8 -- through college. 
Heitkamp, who works part time as a teacher's aide, and her husband, Jacob, an 
educational coordinator for a vocational school, estimate that in 10 years, it 
might cost $25,000 for each to put their children through a public university. 
</P>
<P>
"College is extremely important and totally out of reach," said Heitkamp, who 
has a two-year degree from Long Beach City College and whose husband is a Cal 
State Long Beach graduate. "I know it will be a struggle, but I feel it's worth 
it. I don't know what we will do." 
</P>
<P>
At 3, Christiana Porter's primary interest seems to be eating and finger 
painting, according to her father, Sam Porter Jr. He and his wife, Debra, hope 
to be able to help when she is ready to explore other ambitions, but they have 
been unable to save for a college fund. 
</P>
<P>
"I think college is very critical to get ahead," said Sam Porter, a mason who 
hopes to take law enforcement training to become a police officer. "But there's 
no way we could ever send our daughter to a private school. And even a public 
university will run quite a bit when she is old enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We're unable to save anything now. I don't know what we will do when our 
daughter is college-age." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll consisted of interviews with 600 adult county 
residents. It was conducted Aug. 6 through 8 on weekend days and weekday nights 
using a random sample of listed and unlisted telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of error for a sample of this size is plus or minus 4%. For 
subgroups, the margin of error is higher. The margin of error for a subgroup 
such as the 200 parents with children in school, for example, is plus or minus 
7%. 
</P>
<P>
All respondents were guaranteed anonymity. Some respondents, however, agreed to 
be interviewed again later for news stories on the poll. 
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of Irvine.

SPEECH BY BUSH INFUSES NEW LIFE, AID INTO LOCAL WAR AGAINST DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last October, it took three weeks for officials of Orange County's Drug Use Is 
Life Abuse campaign to raise enough money to buy 700,000 ribbons for the 
county's schoolchildren as part of a drug-awareness week. 
</P>
<P>
This year, after President Bush's Sept. 5 television address calling for a 
"national effort" to combat drug abuse, it took the campaign only two days to 
raise the $30,000 needed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a phenomenal indication of the people's awareness of the drug problem" 
as a result of the President's speech, said Tom Thomson, a Santa Ana commercial 
real estate broker who sits on the board of Drug Use Is Life Abuse, a support 
group for the Orange County Sheriff's Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
Although Orange County has had an active drug prevention campaign, officials 
say the President's speech infused the local effort with new vigor, bringing 
more people off the sidelines and into the drug fight. 
</P>
<P>
One company, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance of Newport Beach, announced it had 
launched a drug education and awareness program for its employees as a result 
of the President's speech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call Draws 800 Responses 
</P>
<P>
A company call for its 1,400 Orange County employees to sign pledge cards 
signifying their commitment against all drug abuse drew more than 800 
responses. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the county, school, church and business leaders say the drug 
problem has become the dominant topic of conversation in the wake of both the 
Sept. 5 speech and a subsequent address Bush aimed at the nation's 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's made a tremendous impact," said Vera Palomino, president of Manos 
Unidas, a Latino organization in Westminster which works with youth. "The kids, 
by listening to the President, have discussed what he had to say." 
</P>
<P>
The spotlight Bush provided came at an opportune time for the Orange County 
drug prevention effort. 
</P>
<P>
Besides greatly facilitating the red-ribbon fund-raising drive, local officials 
said it has broadened interest in events such as a "drug-free" community fair 
that was held Saturday in Dana Point and a drug-crisis forum this past week at 
Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The all-day fair, jointly sponsored by the city of Dana Point, the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department and Drug Use Is Life Abuse, was held at Salt Creek 
Beach Park and featured live entertainment, a spaghetti-eating contest and a 
volleyball clinic. Between 700 and 1,000 people turned out for the fair, 
according to sheriff's deputy Dan Martini, head of police services for Dana 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's appeal to the nation weighed heavily on the minds of about 60 local 
scholars who attended a drug-crisis forum Thursday night, sponsored by the 
National Issues Forum of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Participants, who included some local law enforcement officials, debated the 
pros and cons of the nation's crackdown against drug dealers and explored such 
alternatives as legalizing drugs altogether. The two-hour session concluded 
with no consensus. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us 25 years to get here -- we're not going to fix this overnight," 
said Ted Hunter, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was 
among five panelists invited to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, organizers of the forum called it a success. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the response tonight and the President's proposal were both motivated 
by the same thing -- a great public awareness of and concern with the drug 
crisis," said Harriett Walther, executive director of the National Issues Forum 
of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Police Chief James Cook, a board member of Drug Use Is Life Abuse, 
said that while President Bush really didn't say anything new about the drug 
problem, the speech boosted local anti-drug campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"What the President did was look at what was out there and put words behind a 
problem we were all aware of," Cook said. "The President is turning up the heat 
and he is focusing the drug problem into a sharp, national perspective. People 
are now saying, 'My God, we have a community problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
Before the President jumped into the drug fray, Orange County's drug prevention 
effort had been under way for several years. The effort picked up steam last 
December with formation of Drug Use Is Life Abuse, a nonprofit organization 
made up of leaders from law enforcement, business, churches and schools. The 
organization uses anti-drug patches, decals and bumper stickers as part of an 
intensive drug education campaign for both adults and children. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the group had distributed patches to hundreds of area soccer 
teams, and patches have also been circulated throughout the county's junior 
high and high schools, said Sheriff's Lt. Bill Miller, manager of Drug Use Is 
Life Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The group has been assisting adults by advising companies on how to set up 
workplace drug treatment and prevention programs, Miller said. About 40 to 50 
companies in the county have developed drug programs with the help of Drug Use 
Is Life Abuse, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the President called upon the private sector to play a larger role in the 
drug war, Miller said additional companies have asked his organization for 
assistance in setting up their drug programs. One was Pacific Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"Pacific Mutual and its employees intend to be active participants in fighting 
this battle," said Pacific Mutual Chairman Harry G. Bubb. "To win, we will need 
the commitment and vigilance of the entire community, including students, 
parents, schools, civic and religious organizations. Our goal is to provide our 
employees with the facts about drug abuse so that they can protect themselves 
and their families from its effects." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Mutual program includes various educational and counseling 
services, as well as the signing of pledge cards provided by Drug Use Is Life 
Abuse. The cards declare, "YES, I want to join the army in the war against drug 
abuse." And they give Drug Use Is Life Abuse permission to "use my name as one 
of many Orange County residents who has taken a personal stand." Pledge cards 
signed by the company's employees were presented by Bubb to Fountain Valley 
Mayor Laurann Cook in an anti-drug ceremony Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Pledge cards have also been circulated among area schoolchildren for the past 
two years. Drug education is part of the curriculum at many schools. 
</P>
<P>
Even with these preventive steps, John Ikerd, superintendent of the Orange 
Unified School District and another board member of Drug Use Is Life Abuse, 
said the "real answer" to the overall problem lies in a joint effort with a 
national program, such as what President Bush is advocating. 
</P>
<P>
Ikerd likened the current drug campaign to a drive that began several years ago 
to encourage use of seat belts. At first, he said, few people wore the seat 
belts. Now, Ikerd said, nearly everyone buckles up for safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I think," he said, "we started using seat belts because we finally wised up."

What a frightening question. No wonder we avoid asking it! 
</P>
<P>
No wonder we turn away from our yearning for a more satisfying job with 
rhetorical head-slaps like: "It's not supposed to be fun. Why do you think they 
call it work?" 
</P>
<P>
Outside the vortex of our frustrations, in the rarefied seminars where people 
try to bring order to chaos, massive amounts of lip service are being paid to 
the notion of building a happier worker. 
</P>
<P>
This is, after all, the era of EI (employee involvement), as the seminars call 
it. This is the era of benevolent bosses who practice MWBA (management by 
wandering around), as the consultants call it. 
</P>
<P>
Your company cares about you and your career -- that's the enlightened approach 
that employers like to trumpet these days. 
</P>
<P>
And yet . . . . 
</P>
<P>
What about the tens of millions of us to whom this enlightenment has yet to 
trickle down? 
</P>
<P>
What about the tens of millions of us for whom "the workplace," as our 
less-than-tidy factories and cubicles and classrooms are now tidily known, 
represents a gnawing knot in the stomach, a sinking feeling of lost chances, a 
blackboard filled with daunting challenges -- a situation best summarized not 
by studious consultants, but by that popular bumper sticker: "I Owe, I Owe, So 
Off to Work I Go"? 
</P>
<P>
Ask American workers whether they are satisfied with what they do for a living, 
and a slew of contradictions hits you in the face. 
</P>
<P>
In a Gallup poll released on Labor Day, 89% of 796 employed adults said they 
were satisfied with their jobs to some degree. Yet a significant number groused 
about pressures on the job, low pay, lack of opportunities for promotion and 
the medical benefits their employers provide. 
</P>
<P>
And 40% of those surveyed looked upon their jobs as just a way to make a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
Satisfaction? It's a lovely concept, but too often it has to wait in line 
behind a host of other considerations that sculpt what has become an 
ultra-pressurized existence -- not just for two-income families, but for anyone 
who reads the morning paper and recognizes how lucky he or she is to have a job 
that is steady and protected. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, employment is relatively high, but consider the headlines -- the mergers, 
the purges, the deadly euphemisms -- restructuring, organization transition 
plan. If they're not trying to squeeze your medical benefits they're 
introducing "engineered work standards" and telling you that if you don't 
operate at 96% of that level you'll be disciplined. Some days, it's satisfying 
enough simply to feel secure. 
</P>
<P>
Does it have to be like this? Isn't there a way to slow the world down and 
reflect, with some modicum of optimism, on the bigger questions, like whether 
you feel respected in your job, whether you feel it's important, whether you're 
learning, whether you're positioning yourself for advancement? 
</P>
<P>
Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, what separates us from job satisfaction isn't the powers that be or 
the intangible economic forces or the assistant manager who wanted to hire his 
girlfriend but got stuck with you. It's us. It's our willingness to pull 
ourselves out of life's frustrating inertia and do something -- to take night 
classes at the community college or consult a career counselor or rewrite the 
resume or make the phone calls, to summon the courage to think that maybe, just 
maybe, we're capable of more, and we should -- we must, we will -- find out. 
</P>
<P>
The articles that follow are intended to chip away at your doubts about what 
you can do. They will not solve your problems. But they will make you think. 
</P>
<P>
hey will make you think about job training, about the bridge into management, 
about negotiating for a raise, about increasing your education, about changing 
companies, about scoping out a prospective employer not only on the issue of 
money, but matters such as vacation policy, medical coverage and other 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Some of us are lucky. We came of age with this sort of laundry list in hand. 
Someone -- a parent, a professor, a mentor -- prepared us. The rest of us, the 
vast majority of us, have gaping holes in our game plans. We have all seen 
opportunities slide through these holes. What remains now is to close the gaps, 
cover the bases, widen the field of vision. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of job satisfaction is an attitude dance far more subtle than the 
race for success. It is a test of introspection, a challenge to sit down for a 
while and mull the present and sketch the future and see, in your mind's eye, a 
way to bring those two images closer together. 
</P>
<P>
Read on, and explore.

DISNEYLAND WORKERS RATIFY PACT GIVING FIRST RAISE IN 7 YEARS 
</P>

The Disneyland workers who do everything from operating rides to sweeping Main 
Street voted by a wide margin Saturday to accept the company's latest contract 
offer, which includes the first hourly pay increase for them in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 886 "yes" to 493 "no," 64.2% of the total ballots, well above the 
51% needed to approve the new three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
But the voting left reaction mixed among many of the workers. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who voted 'no' are mad and those who voted 'yes' were motivated by 
short-term profits," said Ross Jones, an eight-year employee who voted against 
the company proposal. "They paid more for the Muppets than they did for their 
own workers." 
</P>
<P>
But others were more satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"This has gone above all that I expected," said Miles Ketchum, 20, who has been 
with Disneyland for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Union negotiators had urged the 2,400 Disneyland workers to approve the 
company's latest contract offer in speeches before the balloting in morning and 
evening sessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Members of 5 Unions 
</P>
<P>
The employees are represented by a coalition of five unions and make up 30% of 
Disneyland's full-time, permanent staff of 8,000. Disneyland's offer included a 
5.5% pay increase for two 18-month periods in the three-year contract, said Tom 
Ramsay, a spokesman for Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a senior ride operator now making $9.94 an hour would get an 
immediate raise to $10.48. A culinary worker now making $8.54 an hour would get 
$9. 
</P>
<P>
The contract also includes an additional 25-cent-an-hour increase for job 
foremen. 
</P>
<P>
In other concessions from the company: A provision allowing management to force 
workers to switch jobs was dropped. The company also agreed to drop a plan to 
cut back on health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, workers went on a 22-day strike that bruised an already 
volatile relationship with management. That action, which pitted strikers 
against employees who stayed on the job, was the longest strike in the park's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lump-Sum Bonuses 
</P>
<P>
In their previous contract, which expired midnight Thursday, workers had agreed 
to accept lump-sum bonuses instead of across-the-board pay increases. Once 
again, the pay increase became a key issue. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday morning, Disneyland negotiators had abandoned their initial offer of 
a 1.5% pay increase for each of the next three years. That proposal had been 
rejected by union representatives, Ramsay said. 
</P>
<P>
The result of the negotiations pleased many of the employees Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best contract I've seen in a long time," said Michele Relation, 
who has been a Disneyland employee for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The contract can do no wrong," said Margie Jones, who has worked at Disneyland 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The pay increase definitely helps. I thought it was a wonderful contract," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at Saturday's meeting said they had been worried about the possibility 
of a strike and had hoped that negotiations between their representatives and 
Disneyland would not sour. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been quite stressful. I kept hoping that they would just keep talking, 
and they did. This turned out to be quite fine. I think everybody is happy 
now," Relation said. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract also gives some part-time workers benefits that they had 
wanted, including holiday pay and health benefits. Previously, such workers 
were paid regular time during holidays and they were not included in health 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Co., which owns Disneyland, marked record earnings for the year.

The job just wasn't right for Prudence Baird. The billing department at a 
public relations firm? Forget it. She had a journalism degree, advertising 
experience, an 8,000-watt personality. Running down American Express bills that 
the bigwigs in the New York office had mistakenly charged to the Los Angeles 
office was paying her rent, but it wasn't charging her up. 
</P>
<P>
Then John Margaritas came into her life. 
</P>
<P>
"John discovered me there in a matter of weeks," she said, and she instantly 
claimed him as her mentor. 
</P>
<P>
Margaritas was the new general manager of Burson-Marsteller's Los Angeles 
office. Practicing his version of the pop management philosophy known as 
"managing by walking around," he met Baird while trying to figure out how to 
cut costs in the office. She had a few ideas, and worked long hours on special 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing I knew," she said, "he had given me a project to do on the 
side," a conservation campaign for the Metropolitan Water District. "I 
succeeded at that, jettisoned over to the PR side, and life has only gotten 
more complicated since." 
</P>
<P>
Now a partner and executive vice president at Josh Baran &amp; Associates in 
Venice, Baird remembers Margaritas as the hand that reached down from the 
corporate heavens and lifted her to Cloud 9. 
</P>
<P>
Many successful executives can name a similar person in their past. They have 
learned that one secret to advancement and satisfaction is the enthusiastic 
pursuit of career advice from the right superior. 
</P>
<P>
In some industries, it is true, such opportunities might be dwindling. As 
companies increasingly cut back, splinter and merge, older executives who find 
time to do more than look out for themselves will become rare, personnel 
authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some willing counselors will remain, and experts believe that it is 
important for younger employees to find them. 
</P>
<P>
Some large organizations, such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co., formalize this 
notion with so-called mentoring programs that pair older and younger employees, 
hoping to spark a fire by rubbing the right two sticks together. 
</P>
<P>
But spontaneous combustion seems to make for relationships of greater intensity 
-- as Margaritas and Baird discovered. 
</P>
<P>
"I will spend time with anyone with enthusiasm to help them learn the 
business," said Margaritas, now chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy &amp; 
Mather Public Relations in New York. How does he find such people? Here's a 
radical concept: He asks them. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if you don't find out what people want, you can't give it to 
them," he said. "And at the same time, I believe that if you know how to help 
people achieve their goals, you can benefit the company." 
</P>
<P>
The trust required in a mentor relationship takes a long time to develop -- a 
factor that sabotages many corporate efforts to foster mentoring, according to 
Harry Bernhard, an associate dean of executive education at USC. 
</P>
<P>
For insecure executives, especially, mentoring can be just a bureaucratic 
exercise: How can you coach someone about opportunity at the company when you 
don't know where you stand yourself? 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to mentor other people because it requires an intimacy, a kind of 
caring, that a lot of executives can't muster because they are too busy," 
Bernhard said. "Realistically, when the command of control is stretched thin 
and you are running from crisis to crisis, spending two hours talking to 
someone about their career is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Even when a superior and a subordinate do click, dangers lie ahead. It is 
possible to become so involved with a mentor, Bernhard said, that when he 
folds, you fold. "It's a better strategy to hitch your wagon to more than one 
star," he said. And it is also dangerous to become "overmentored," or unduly 
dependent on one boss. "If you cannot work outside the scope of that one 
particular mentor," he said, "then you have been crippled." 
</P>
<P>
In its rawest form, mentoring allows bosses to clone and ultimately replace 
themselves, according to Harry Usher, managing director in Los Angeles for 
Russell Reynolds Associates, an international executive placement firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet, with the breakup of various companies," he said, "you see more difficulty 
in terms of trying to do succession planning in more coherent, organized 
fashion because, so often, the parts don't remain with the whole." 
</P>
<P>
The strongest mentor relationships tend to outlast an individual's association 
with one firm, however. Ogilvy's Margaritas remembers that his former boss in 
General Electric's public relations department, Al Tortorella, advised him to 
leave GE for a job with a specialized public relations firm. Tortorella also 
advised him to join Burson-Marsteller in Chicago, rather than at its 
headquarters in New York, Margaritas said, "because I would grow faster and be 
seen more quickly there." From there he was promoted to the job in Los Angeles 
-- where he became Baird's mentor. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhard, the USC dean, said his work as a marketing manager at IBM led him to 
believe that there are two good ways to develop people's talents: Give them a 
hard job and help them to do it well. "Ninety percent of all development occurs 
from just doing the work, getting experience, but the other 10% comes from 
counseling," he said. "Mentoring can have a catalytic effect, making that other 
90% worth 150% more. It's the yeast."

SELECTING A TRADE SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
A LITTLE HOMEWORK CAN HELP IN FINDING ONE THAT FITS

The high school counselor tells you to go to college. Mom wants you to be a 
doctor. And Dad says he doesn't care what you do as long you're happy, but, 
gee, wouldn't law school be terrific? 
</P>
<P>
Well, no, you tell the folks. What you really want to do is deal cards, pour 
drinks, take care of kids (and get paid for it), fix computers, cut hair, drive 
a truck, cook (and get paid for it), groom pets, build boats or fix musical 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanford University won't teach you to be a nanny. And UCLA doesn't offer a 
major in tending bar. So what's an aspiring student of any age to do? Call the 
local trade school, of course. 
</P>
<P>
California has an estimated 2,000 technical and vocational schools -- some 400 
of which are accredited -- schools that teach everything from air conditioning 
repair to X-ray technology. But not all trade schools are created equal, and 
court cases have shown that some are better avoided than enrolled in. 
</P>
<P>
Still, trade schools "have been filling a void, supplying services that people 
have not been able to find in other sectors of higher education for years," 
said Christopher Davis, spokesman for the National Assn. of Trade and Technical 
Schools. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 2 million students attend such schools. The average course is 
10 months long, and the average cost for that 10-month course is $3,800. In the 
last decade, the number of accredited schools represented by Davis' group has 
risen to 1,300 from 550. Industrywide, Davis said, enrollment has increased 
about 14% in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"College tuition is increasing faster than inflation, and we think that may be 
a reason why more students are turning to our schools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Students like Lavene Banks, who is currently a loan officer at the American 
Federation of Television and Radio Artists-Screen Actors Guild Credit Union in 
Los Angeles. Before Banks enrolled in the Banking Institute, she had a 
low-paying job as a supermarket courtesy clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Banks finished the four-month course, which is given in the former Union Bank 
headquarters building at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue. 
Three days before she graduated from the 13-year-old school, she got her first 
job -- as a bank teller for the credit union. Soon after that, she was promoted 
to her current position. 
</P>
<P>
Banks' experience with technical school was a good one, in part because she 
checked out the school carefully before plunking down her $2,515 for tuition, 
books and registration. 
</P>
<P>
According to Davis, students looking for private technical schools should 
follow a few important rules: 
</P>
<P>
* Students should contact several schools, request information and carefully 
review the catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
* They should visit the school and tour the entire facility. If, for example, 
the institution says it teaches computer repair, it should actually have 
computers on campus. 
</P>
<P>
* Students should make it a point to talk to past and present students and 
employers who hire the school's graduates. They should find out what employers 
think of their new workers and what kind of starting salaries they offer. 
</P>
<P>
* Students should make sure that, if they drop out of the school, a reasonable 
percentage of their tuition is refundable -- for example, 75% if they make it 
through only a quarter of the program. 
</P>
<P>
* And they should make sure that the school is accredited and licensed by the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of promise versus performance," Davis said. "Students should 
find out what the school's promises are and if the school actually makes good." 
</P>
<P>
But Elena Ackel, special projects attorney for the Legal Aid Foundation of Los 
Angeles, gives a different kind of advice to students looking for private 
vocational schools: Don't go. 
</P>
<P>
Ackel receives an average of five complaints a week from students who say they 
have been defrauded by such institutions -- ones where a different teacher 
taught each day, or where students who dropped out were not refunded their 
money. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to vocational education, Ackel said: "The suggestion that I give 
is to go to Los Angeles Trade Tech or an L.A. community college." 
</P>
<P>
But if you insist on attending a private trade school, this is what Ackel 
counseled: "You shouldn't train for something that requires no training. . . . 
If you do, you're being sucked in for a lot of stuff you don't need." 
</P>
<P>
Kristin Kleppe, owner and president of the Banking Institute, takes great 
exception to such criticisms of trade and technical schools and contends that 
bad publicity does more to damage students than to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
"If consumers understood what questions to ask and how to research schools, I 
think they'd be more willing to take risks and find success that's potentially 
there for them," Kleppe said. 
</P>
<P>
Sybil Henry, a free-lance fashion designer, took that risk in 1981 when she 
enrolled in the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Fashion Institute offers some basic college classes in its 
curriculum, its major mission is to teach students about the garment industry 
and then get them jobs. That's just what it did for Henry, who graduated in 
1983 and has made a living designing women's and children's sportswear ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
"I had basic skills, natural ability," Henry said. "But they needed to be 
refined, molded, made marketable. . . . I loved the school. It gave me all the 
foundation I needed to be a professional and compete in the industry."

<P>
At Rockwell International, a master's degree in one of a number of specialized 
engineering fields is the key to career advancement and high pay. 
</P>
<P>
At computer giant Hewlett-Packard, fully 35% of the Palo Alto firm's college 
recruits have master's degrees or better. 
</P>
<P>
And at Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bank, an MBA from a top school is 
still the surest entree to the fast track. 
</P>
<P>
People with advanced degrees are increasingly in demand, especially in business 
or technical fields, experts in industry and education say. Yet whatever your 
educational background, the experts advise, success also can depend on 
recognizing an employer's needs and honing your skills to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're really looking for is flexibility, initiative, teamwork skills," 
said Barbara Waugh, recruiting manager at Hewlett-Packard. "A highly motivated 
BA with these qualities will advance further than someone with a master's or 
Ph.D. who lacks them. A degree can be important in becoming part of the pool of 
people that we look at, but once you're in the door, everyone forgets about 
your degree." 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Myklebust, college relations manager and assistant vice president at 
Union Bank in Los Angeles, agreed. "We pay for performance, not just the 
degree. I've seen cases where, while the MBA is going to school, some hotshot 
BA is working his tail off, developing a track record and moving ahead." 
</P>
<P>
June Millet, senior analyst and career counselor at UCLA, said: "You have to 
look at what you do well, the fields for which you have a passion. "Then 
prepare to be the best in that field. The most important learning occurs on the 
job, but you have to have the equipment to begin with. That means a bachelor's, 
at least, but not necessarily a master's. It depends on the degree of 
concentration that you want." 
</P>
<P>
With no more than a high school diploma, she added, even an entry-level 
position can be hard to find. "The exception might be a young high school 
graduate who has gotten on-the-job experience . . . in a specialty skill 
through an apprenticeship or internship program," Millet said. 
</P>
<P>
Career focus, as well as education, helps lead to success at Los Angeles-based 
food maker Carnation, said Judy Wagner, manager of staffing and recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"When we look at candidates, we really look at those who understand 
packaged-goods marketing and know that's what they want to do," she said. "A 
lot of undergrads don't understand what marketing is, but we do have a number 
of good BA candidates every year who move up in the same track as our MBAs, 
although their training period is longer." 
</P>
<P>
Although an advanced degree may not be essential, a recent master's graduate 
will command a higher starting salary. Robert Bruce, career planning and 
placement director at Claremont Graduate School east of Los Angeles, said that 
someone with a bachelor's degree in business from a top-ranked school, for 
example, can expect to enter the Southern California work force at a salary of 
about $30,000 a year. With an MBA, that person's initial earning power jumps to 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce also noted a renewed acceptance of the undergraduate liberal arts degree 
among executives. "Now many CEOs are saying they want the Renaissance man, the 
educated person, and the company will teach them the specialty skills they 
need," he said. "But that thinking has not filtered down to the recruiter level 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
In many technical fields, advanced training is still key. For the most part, 
this means a master's degree, although a Ph.D. is often required for a career 
in research or higher education. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is very specialized now," said John Wilhite, manager of corporate 
college relations for Hughes Aircraft Co. "Many technical areas in today's 
high-tech industries require advanced training beyond a bachelor's degree. 
</P>
<P>
"If you come out of college with a BA, you'll find that you'll need to get 
advanced training in some field. Someone with only a BA will probably advance 
more slowly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Opportunities are expected to expand in the near future for those with advanced 
degrees in the education and health-care fields. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in teaching at the college level, "Many teachers and professors 
are reaching retirement and starting second careers, and the replacements are 
not there," UCLA's Millet said. "What most people don't know is that, 
particularly at the community college level, the salary and benefits are much 
better than they used to be. Starting salary is $30,000 for nine months, and it 
is past $55,000 for a full professor -- plus the benefits are excellent." 
</P>
<P>
In the health-care field, an advanced degree, particulary in nursing, will be 
desirable, said Vance Grant, a specialist in education statistics with the 
Department of Education in Washington. "Growth looks very good in that field 
due to the aging of the population," he added. 
</P>
<P>
In business, "the MBA is still the ticket," said Gretchen Thompson of First 
Interstate Bancorp. And the degree should be from a well-regarded school, she 
said, such as UCLA, Stanford, Harvard or the Wharton School at the University 
of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Several recruiters noted a rise in popularity of "executive MBA" programs, 
through which mid-career managers update their skills or augment their 
non-business undergraduate degrees to improve their management techniques or 
change careers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is preferable to have had some (work) experience before getting an MBA," 
said Waugh of Hewlett-Packard. "It gives you a maturity factor." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Millet urges career planners at any stage of life to keep their 
decisions in perspective. "Everybody can be whatever 'successful' means to 
them," she said. "A person can develop a decent life style, make a living, 
provide for their future and grow if all they have is a BA. You have to find 
out what you really have a passion for. If you do, you will do

Patricia G. Walter was an audiologist, helping rehabilitate the hearing 
impaired, before she became a vice president and financial consultant at 
Shearson Lehman Hutton in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Bowker was an accountant in the oil business before he started a 
fast-food restaurant in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl A. McDuel is an engineer at Southern California Gas Co. who is going to 
law school to pursue a new career as a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Count these three among the thousands of Americans changing professions in 
search of the ultimate in job satisfaction and personal growth. 
</P>
<P>
"What we see today is people are making more and more changes," said Susan 
Geifman, director of the career development center at John F. Kennedy 
University in Orinda, Calif., where the average age of students is 37 and most 
are returning to school to enhance or change careers. "What's happened in the 
workplace is that companies are in so much flux. Employers cannot guarantee 
lifetime employment any more. People need to be aware of what they want and how 
they can find it. From my standpoint, job security begins with yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, job security and money were the key factors in changing jobs. 
Today, workers rank job satisfaction as their No. 1 employment concern, 
according to a 1988 survey of employees at 100 companies by Personnel Journal, 
a Costa Mesa trade publication. Job security ranked second, followed by more 
money, better benefits, new challenges and opportunities for promotion. 
</P>
<P>
The shift in attitudes reflects rising expectations among today's workers, who 
increasingly see their jobs as a source of personal fulfillment, social 
relationships and community responsibility, according to career counselors. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more support for not putting up with the intolerable or a 
nonsatisfying option," explained Lesah Beckhusen, a career counselor at Square 
One Career Services in Oakland who specializes in identifying career options. 
</P>
<P>
"More people have a sense that they can do something about their jobs, that 'I 
don't need to stay 10 years.' . . . It's much more acceptable for people to 
make radical changes," Beckhusen said. One of her clients, a lawyer, gave it 
all up to become a massage therapist. "With new-age consciousness, people are 
not as willing to compromise their values. It's difficult for people to accept 
collective viewpoints: the 9-to-5 job, making lots of money, doing things 
harmful to the environment," Beckhusen said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowker, for example, made a major decision not to stay with Unocal after 15 
years when the company moved its Denver subsidiary to Midland, Tex. He stayed 
in Denver and then moved to Los Angeles in 1978, but found himself bouncing 
between accounting jobs at various oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, little oil companies were being gobbled up, merging, going 
bankrupt, going out of business. There were no jobs in the oil business," he 
said. Because he needed to keep working, Bowker, now 68, opened Wings of the 
West fast-food outlet in 1986 with his son, who had experience in the 
restaurant business. 
</P>
<P>
A decision to make a career change should not be made hastily, career 
counselors caution. Merely feeling dissatisfied is perhaps the worst reason to 
leave a job. "People tend to think it (dissatisfaction) is in this job, where 
it may not be the job but new working conditions or a new boss," Beckhusen 
explained. The discontent may stem from overwork or not having enough time with 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to clarify what's not working and what do you need to feel 
satisfied," Beckhusen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The starting place is yourself," said Geifman at John F. Kennedy University. 
"Who are you? What do you like to do? What do you know of your skills and 
abilities? What kind of work environment do you want to be in? Here at the 
center when we get someone who doesn't know, we do self-assessment and look at 
values. What is important to you at this point in your life? . . . Is the 
dissatisfaction with what you're doing, or would a change within the work 
situation help or alleviate your situation? You may not need a complete career 
change; maybe you need to change to a different department, different tasks. 
When you look at your present situation and more or less determine that you're 
not satisfied, it's time to look out there." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, McDuel began studying his options. Seeking "a combination of 
job satisfaction and having more control," he decided to attend Glendale School 
of Law part time. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old, who has a master's degree in mechanical engineering, is the 
pipeline safety regulatory administrator at Southern California Gas Co. But he 
felt his opportunities at the company had topped out. "After 15 years, job 
opportunities that I wished I had had didn't happen for me. . . . It's a good 
feeling to know there are still opportunities to gain with education." 
</P>
<P>
Although the gas company subsidizes some of his law school tuition, McDuel may 
be looking for a law job elsewhere because, he said, employees who have earned 
law degrees rarely have been hired for the company's legal staff. But McDuel is 
confident that his marketability will be enhanced by his combination of 
technical and legal skills. 
</P>
<P>
"The next three years will be sacrifices but the opportunity around the door is 
what I'm looking for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is easier to go from one job to another than find a new one when unemployed. 
"The longer you're out of a job, the more difficult it is" said Joseph J. 
Carideo, a partner in the management consulting firm of Thorndike Deland 
Associates in New York. Another rule of thumb is the higher your current 
earnings, the longer it will take to find a job with equivalent pay, if that is 
important. 
</P>
<P>
It also is unwise to freely discuss a search for more career satisfaction. One 
of Beckhusen's clients who was taking a career workshop talked about her 
experiences at work. Although the woman had no plans to actually change jobs, 
her boss thought otherwise, and fired her. 
</P>
<P>
Carideo cautioned: "Don't make a move merely to get out of an unpleasant 
situation. Negative motivation seldom pays off." Meanwhile, he advised, be 
aware of some signals, such as a change in reporting responsibilities or being 
passed over for promotions at least twice, which indicate that it's time to 
take stock of a job situation. 
</P>
<P>
Even with careful planning, a job change involves financial and emotional 
risks. One sunny day, Walter's private practice as an audiologist came crashing 
down. A physician group that provided 45% of her business said it was going to 
stop the referrals and become her competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of rebuilding her business, she sold it. She had always entertained a 
notion of having a second career in the brokerage business, so the newly 
married Walter became what she calls a "baby broker" in a training program at 
Shearson Lehman. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the decision because basically I'm a survivor. If it had not been for 
Bill (her husband), it would have been much worse. He had to prop me up 
emotionally when my ego was under the rug somewhere. It was difficult when at 
34 I was on the top of it all with my own business to go to the bottom. As a 
baby broker I was cold-calling (strangers) to get clients. I went from a 
six-figure income to zero. . . . It was horrible, I don't know if I have the 
strength to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Some nights, she said, "I went home hysterical, saying 'I can't do this. Nobody 
likes me.' " She stuck with it and within three years was again earning a 
six-figure salary. But today as then, she works 15-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
It took Bowker about three years to get on his feet with his fast-food 
business. "In our plans it sounded rosy," Bowker recalled, but real life proved 
otherwise. When his son left the business, Bowker worked seven days a week 
handling all aspects of the business. 
</P>
<P>
"Man it was tough. We just about went under," he recalled. "I was selling some 
personal belongings," including a gun collection and his wife's and 
mother-in-law's quilt collection, "just to keep our heads above the water . . . 
all my credit cards were spent to the limit." 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a relaxing time. It was a very tense time. I was just on the edge 
all the time." But by the third year, Wings of the West was making a profit and 
Bowker received a buyout offer. He sold his labor of love in July. 
</P>
<P>
For those who make a major career change and find success, there comes an 
immense sense of satisfaction and some advice. "You have to be really sold on 
yourself, that you can do something," Bowker said. "You have to have confidence 
in yourself, hold yourself upright and go after it."

Rose and Paul Hughes of Petaluma could find new jobs if they wanted to, but 
they won't under the conditions they would have to accept. The problem: No 
employer's medical insurance would cover treatment of their 8-year-old son's 
leukemia because clauses in the policies exclude "pre-existing conditions." 
</P>
<P>
"When we started asking questions, we realized no one would insure my son," 
Rose Hughes said. Her husband has remained self-employed while she has started 
a nonprofit foundation for the parents of children with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Their situation illustrates that changing jobs isn't always a simple matter 
when it comes to medical coverage and life insurance. A new employer's policy 
may not fit your family's needs, life style or budget -- and any one of those 
is reason enough to reconsider whether to take a new job. 
</P>
<P>
As medical insurance costs rise, many companies are requiring employees to pay 
higher deductibles or premiums. Others may have payment plans that could mean 
considerable financial risk to you. 
</P>
<P>
These and other insurance concerns have become important labor-management 
issues. In recent strikes, nurses in San Francisco and employees of Pacific 
Bell and other regional phone companies were resisting demands that they bear a 
greater share of health insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, many workers still take their health and life insurance plans for 
granted, never checking into what is covered and what it will cost. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't look at their choices carefully enough," said Lois 
Salisbury of Health Access, a statewide coalition of labor, consumer and other 
groups working to promote affordable health care. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some key questions you should ask about medical coverage and life 
insurance provided by a prospective employer, or the one you already have: 
</P>
<P>
Health Insurance 
</P>
<P>
* How much will the plan cost? How much financial risk must you bear? 
</P>
<P>
Fewer and fewer companies are willing to pay all of an employee's medical 
insurance bill, according to Hewitt Associates, an employee benefits consulting 
firm. More and more, workers are required to chip in, usually through one of 
four financial arrangements: 1) You pick up part of the premium costs; 2) you 
pay a deductible; 3) co-payments, which usually means you pay a set amount each 
time you see a doctor, or 4) coinsurance, by which you pay a fixed percentage 
of each bill. 
</P>
<P>
Each option carries vastly different financial ramifications. Coinsurance, by 
far, is potentially the most risky. If you are liable for, say, 20% of all 
expenses, a $200,000 or $300,000 medical bill for heart bypass surgery could 
sock you with a $40,000 debt, said Jim Shultz, a policy analyst at Consumers 
Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. Under such a plan, find out if 
there is a limit to your financial risk, he suggests. 
</P>
<P>
High co-payments also could be a problem because cost might deter you from 
seeking medical attention when you really need it, Shultz added. "You may not 
bring your kid in for a fever when you really ought to. So look for low 
co-payments," he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Also, find out whether the employer is seeking to reduce its contributions to 
the medical plan, Shultz adds. 
</P>
<P>
* Does the employer offer a choice of a preferred-provider network or a health 
maintenance organization? 
</P>
<P>
Historically, medical coverage has been provided under an "indemnity" plan by 
which you choose your doctors, hospitals and other services. Because of rising 
costs, more and more employers are contracting with networks of preferred 
doctors and hospitals -- called preferred provider organizations, or PPOs -- 
which give those firms' employees lower rates in exchange for the promise of 
volume business. Such an arrangement can mean lower deductibles or co-payments 
or other savings for you. 
</P>
<P>
For the same reason, many employers offer membership in a health maintenance 
organization, or HMO, which can provide similar savings. The drawback to an 
HMO, however, is a limited selection of providers. If you already have a 
favorite doctor or hospital, find out if they are in the employer's PPO network 
or HMO. 
</P>
<P>
* Does the employer offer flexibility in the type of plan you can have? 
</P>
<P>
Most employers don't allow room for individual negotiation on a health plan, 
but a growing number of firms are setting up flexible benefit plans -- also 
known as cafeteria plans -- that generally allow you to choose the types and 
amounts of benefits and coverages you want, often based on costs and other 
factors. For example, if you are already covered by your spouse's medical 
policy, you may opt for less medical coverage and more dental coverage or life 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
You also may have choices in deductibles and premiums -- for example, you may 
be able to opt for a higher deductible in exchange for a lower premium. If you 
are young, single and healthy, you probably will be better off with higher 
deductibles because you won't need to see a doctor very often, said Duane C. 
Bollert, manager of the Los Angeles office of Hewitt Associates. 
</P>
<P>
But be wary of flexible plans because some might exclude or reduce certain 
types of coverage, such as pediatric care, that you might find important, 
Consumers Union's Shultz says. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers offer policies with tiered costs. If you are single, the cost is 
lower than if you are married and have children. In some rare cases, companies 
might also offer discounts to nonsmokers, nondrinkers and others perceived as 
better-than-average risks. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies also offer employees incentives for keeping costs down. An 
Akron, Ohio, manufacturer, for example, rebates two-thirds of a worker's 
premiums if he or she doesn't submit a claim after a year. 
</P>
<P>
* Does the policy impose pre-existing conditions or waiting periods? 
</P>
<P>
To weed out those perceived to be high risks, many plans do not cover 
pre-existing conditions such as cancer or heart ailments. "It's a very big 
problem," Shultz of Consumers Union said. "A lot of workers who have 
pre-existing conditions will not leave a job because they can't get coverage 
through a new employer." 
</P>
<P>
Other plans may impose a waiting period, usually six months, for joining the 
medical plan. If you forget to sign up after the waiting period, some companies 
may exclude you from the plan until the next enrollment period, according to 
Hewitt Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Find out about such limitations and explore alternatives to waiting periods. 
You might be able to get reduced coverage in the interim. You may be able to 
continue coverage from your old employer, although that could be expensive, 
since many companies no longer subsidize medical coverage for former employees, 
Bollert said. 
</P>
<P>
* What supplemental coverages are offered? 
</P>
<P>
Most companies offer dental coverage as well as standard medical, and a few 
also offer coverage of prescription drugs, vision, hearing, psychiatric and 
preventive care, and alternative treatments such as acupuncture. Long-term care 
insurance, which covers nursing home expenses, is rarely offered. Some plans 
also may not cover basic checkups and physical examinations. 
</P>
<P>
If one or more of these types of coverages are important to you, find out if 
your employer offers them and how much extra they will cost. 
</P>
<P>
* Does the employer offer retiree coverage? 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, most large companies continue medical coverage for their retirees. 
Such policies generally are worthwhile because most have "catastrophic" 
coverage to supplement Medicare, Hewitt Associates explained. 
</P>
<P>
"For an older person -- say, 50 and up -- retiree benefits might make or break 
a decision to switch jobs," Hewitt advises. 
</P>
<P>
With costs of providing insurance on the rise, however, many companies are 
trying to reduce retirees' medical coverage. Some are requiring that retired 
workers pay the same deductibles and co-payments as active employees. Others 
are maintaining coverage for those nearing retirement but reducing it for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Life Insurance 
</P>
<P>
* How does the plan fit your family needs? How much will it cost? 
</P>
<P>
Life insurance is as common an employee benefit as health coverage among major 
employers, Hewitt Associates says. Most basic plans provide term insurance, 
which provides a death benefit but no savings component. Most consumer 
advocates consider term insurance to be the best value. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, life insurance is either company-paid or employee-paid. Usually, the 
death benefit in either case will be one or two times the annual pay of a 
salaried worker, or between $10,000 and $20,000 for an hourly employee, Bollert 
said. Most companies also allow employees the option of buying extra coverage. 
</P>
<P>
If you have no dependents, or you are older and all your children are working 
and fending for themselves, you probably don't need any life insurance. So if 
coverage is voluntary -- perhaps offered through a flexible-benefits plan -- 
see if you can decline life insurance and save money. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you have many dependents, see if the company will allow 
you to increase your coverage. 
</P>
<P>
For those with large families, some companies are offering new products, such 
as so-called group universal life, that provide a savings component in addition 
to death benefits. Some companies also allow you to buy insurance for your 
dependents. 
</P>
<P>
If you are older, in many cases the premiums will be higher. For example, in a 
typical plan, the premium may be 10 cents or less for each $1,000 of coverage 
if you are age 35, but $1 if you are age 60, Bollert says. If you are older and 
the charges are higher, it may be worthwhile to double-check with a personal 
carrier to see if you can't get cheaper insurance, he says. 
</P>
<P>
* Does the employer offer long-term disability coverage? 
</P>
<P>
Most major industrial employers sponsor this coverage for salaried employees 
but impose certain restrictions, such as longer waiting periods for hourly 
employees, presumably because of higher turnover, Hewitt Associates says. 
Generally, this type of coverage is worthwhile, although few employees ever 
make use of it.

COUNSELING PROGRAMS CAN SALVAGE CAREERS WHILE HOLDING DOWN COSTS

<P>
The manager was in danger of losing his job at Wells Fargo Bank. He had a new 
boss who didn't like the way he was doing his job. He was missing deadlines, 
taking days off and drinking too much. He withdrew from his wife and lied about 
how much alcohol he was consuming. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the manager, Wells Fargo runs a $450,000-a-year employee 
assistance program to help workers with personal problems. His boss referred 
him to the vice president and director of employee assistance services, Dr. 
Bryan Lawton. "We uncovered a serious drinking problem that he'd been denying," 
Lawton said, "and convinced him to enter a detox and rehabilitation program. He 
was off work for 21 days, during which he also began marital counseling." 
</P>
<P>
The manager returned to work energetic, confident and able to concentrate as 
never before. His boss said he was "like a totally different person." Six 
months later, the manager was promoted. 
</P>
<P>
The bank manager's experience is becoming increasingly common as companies 
across the nation see the importance of dealing with employees' personal 
problems. More than 90% of the Fortune 500 companies now offer such assistance 
as part of their benefits packages, Lawton said. Throughout the United States, 
100,000 such programs are already in place. 
</P>
<P>
They are cost effective, Lawton said. Studies of employee assistance have found 
that such programs are cheaper than paying the direct and indirect costs of 
problems that interfere with workers' performance. They save money, he said, by 
heading off medical and disability claims, reducing absenteeism and tardiness, 
and improving the employee's concentration and relationships at the office. 
</P>
<P>
Employees' personal problems are estimated to cost American corporations 
billions of dollars annually. Lawton said personal problems affect the 
performance of 18% of the average company's work force. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking and drug abuse are common reasons employees seek help; marital 
problems and stress also are high on the list. Joy Blazey, a licensed clinical 
social worker and director of employee assistance programs for several Southern 
California corporations, said that women, in particular, report overwhelming 
stress in juggling the demands of their jobs and family responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
One manager at a major corporation came to Blazey after he was demoted. His ego 
was shattered. "I'm back in a job I was in 10 years ago. It's humiliating to my 
family. It's horrible and embarrassing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Blazey counseled the manager on building self-esteem. Eventually, the man was 
able to evaluate his strengths realistically and take practical steps to fill 
in areas where he was weak. 
</P>
<P>
"He took some courses to sharpen his skills and was eventually promoted again 
-- to a lesser position than the glorious first promotion, but one that was 
satisfying and closer to home," Blazey said. After four months of counseling, 
he saw this not as a comedown, but as a successful transition to living his 
life within reasonable limits, in a more balanced way. 
</P>
<P>
The success rate among workers who seek counseling through the workplace is 
fairly high: between 60% and 80% of them move out of a crisis and go back to 
their jobs functioning better than before. 
</P>
<P>
"A common thread among people who don't benefit from counseling is denial," 
said Blazey. One woman was referred to counseling on "final notice" from her 
employer. She had been late to work and performing below par for months. "Her 
attitude was, 'How dare they demand this of me? I'm a single mother and my life 
is hard enough already.' She couldn't (admit) that she had a problem performing 
the job. She was soon fired." 
</P>
<P>
Getting counseling through the workplace is almost always voluntary -- between 
75% and 95% of the workers who seek help come of their own accord, employee 
assistance programs report. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year at Southern California Edison, we saw about 3% of our employees" but 
would like to be able to offer treatment to more of them, said Dr. Carl Osborn, 
manager of psychological services at the utility. He said the program's staff 
is being expanded. 
</P>
<P>
Counseling is supposed to be completely confidential. "That is the most 
critical factor in any successful program," said Lawton. "We don't release any 
information without the employee's express permission. That is guaranteed by 
the company policy, by state and federal law, as well as our professional 
license -- we're all licensed therapists." 
</P>
<P>
Some unions and legal experts advise workers to receive written assurance of 
confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
Employees who arrive by "mandatory referral" -- when their supervisors require 
them to be evaluated -- are told on their first visit that the "mandatory" part 
has been satisfied by their showing up. Beyond that, the only information the 
supervisor is given is whether the employee elects to follow the therapist's 
suggestions. The nature of the employee's problem is never divulged. 
</P>
<P>
Few counseling programs offer long-range therapy in-house. Company counselors 
are there to evaluate employees' problems and refer them to outside services 
such as Alcoholics Anonymous, clinics and other forms of help available to the 
general public. 
</P>
<P>
Some programs are designed to cope with problems such as abrasive management 
styles and faulty business etiquette. At some companies, managers who rub 
everyone the wrong way are referred to in-house workshops on personal style. At 
other companies, junior executives who are naive about the social aspects of 
doing business may be required to attend workshops on hosting business dinners 
or making introductions. 
</P>
<P>
To find out whether an employer has such a program, check its employee benefits 
handbook. But not all companies cover the cost of outside help that may be 
recommended by a counselor. Check more closely under "mental health coverage" 
to find out how much the firm's health plan covers.

At the Shalek Agency, having fun is serious business. 
</P>
<P>
Employees and friends recently gathered for a beach party at Santa Monica's 
tony Sand and Sea Club, where they drank beer, competed in volleyball games and 
played goofy relay races. 
</P>
<P>
"We find a lot of excuses to have parties," said Nancy Shalek, president of the 
1 1/2-year-old advertising firm. "My party budget would hire an assistant 
account executive." 
</P>
<P>
Like many other managers, Shalek, 34, is finding that joy on the job can 
translate into a more productive work force. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly in small companies, executives are beginning to realize that all 
work and no play is scarcely the best policy when it comes to improving 
teamwork and enhancing creativity. As a result, they are building recreation 
into the corporate culture. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer Inc., based in Cupertino, Calif., holds a beer bust every Friday 
afternoon and encourages employees to get involved in company-sponsored skiing, 
running and biking. No one bats an eye when members of the Ultimate Frisbee 
Club scoot out at midday to toss the disc. 
</P>
<P>
The president of a payroll services company in San Francisco camped out at 7 
a.m. recently to buy a block of "Batman" tickets for employees and their 
families. About 70 moviegoers showed up, many in Batman T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
At Odetics, an Anaheim high-tech firm that makes robots and data recorders for 
space shuttles, the official Fun Committee brought in a phone booth for a '50s 
party to see how many people could cram into it. The magic number was 16. 
</P>
<P>
Why all this attention to fun and games? 
</P>
<P>
"It starts out with the idea that you spend more time at work than you do 
anywhere else, if you take away sleeping hours," said Joel Slutzky, chairman 
and chief executive of Odetics, which founded its Fun Committee years ago. "You 
should want to get up and go to work." 
</P>
<P>
If employees look forward to the workday, he said, "then it will be that much 
easier to do their jobs in an innovative way." 
</P>
<P>
And that's not the only benefit. Slutzky said his company also has less 
absenteeism, one of the lowest turnover rates of key people in the electronics 
industry and medical costs 20% below the industry average. 
</P>
<P>
A survey by David J. Abramis, a professor of management at California State 
University, Long Beach, backs up what Slutzky has learned. Abramis questioned 
341 Southern California employees and found that those who say they have fun on 
the job are generally less anxious and depressed, are more satisfied with their 
lives in general and tend to miss less work. 
</P>
<P>
"Our best guess is these things are beneficial to the bottom line," said 
Abramis, who is writing a book with the working title of "Making Work Fun." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, not all employees need a party or outing to make work pleasant. 
Many get their kicks from solving problems or completing a project. 
</P>
<P>
A flexible benefits program at Apple Computer, where employees routinely work 
long days, attempts to address the need for both fun and job satisfaction, 
according to Tim Larson, manager of health and fitness. 
</P>
<P>
"People work extremely hard here, and management realizes the importance of a 
balanced life and stress release," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company occasionally "works in a little work with the play," turning 
something like river rafting into a team-building exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Larson declined to say how much the company spends on fun. But with events such 
as the weekly beer bust -- featuring catered food, free-flowing wine and beer 
and entertainment -- expenses clearly mount up. 
</P>
<P>
Slutzky of Odetics noted that fun events need not chew up a huge chunk of 
budget and should go beyond routine picnics and the like. 
</P>
<P>
A "couch potato" contest -- for employees "who wanted to get into fitness 
without working up a sweat" -- cost just $50, which covered paper airplanes and 
miniature golf, among other activities. For Lakers Day, employees who wore 
purple and gold got a free lunch. 
</P>
<P>
For Secretaries Day last year, managers dressed up as waiters and served lunch 
in the cafeteria. A company repertory theater has put on several plays. On 
Sept. 1, the Fun Committee held a surprise bash to celebrate the company's 20th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance, I think, is that it have a certain spontaneity," Slutzky said 
of the atypical events. 
</P>
<P>
But regular outings have their place too. Jude Bressman, a Disneyland 
spokeswoman, said 70 companies plan annual events at the theme park and 
hundreds of others make plans periodically to spend an evening in the Magic 
Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
The park's biggest corporate event ever was in celebration of the Hughes 
Aircraft-General Motors merger in 1986, when 180,000 guests visited the park 
over nine days, courtesy of their employer. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, small businesses find it easier to plan for fun than do large 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Plourd, the president of Payday, the Payroll Company in San Francisco, 
who organized the "Batman" outing, said she and other hard-core backpackers at 
the firm have made a ritual of camping in Yosemite in late summer. "We have our 
own special place where we go," Plourd said. 
</P>
<P>
The company also annually invites employees' children to visit for a day. The 
children get to play games and eat lunch as well as sit next to their parents 
to watch them work. 
</P>
<P>
"Fun and humor are an absolute essence of life," Plourd said. "To isolate that 
from the workplace is insane." 
</P>
<P>
Shalek, the advertising executive, is another boss who makes a point of having 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
"We're building a company, and building a company has a lot to do with how 
people want to work together," she said. "We spend a lot of time working on 
building a team. One of the best ways I've found is to build friendships 
outside the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Shalek is convinced that the money spent is worthwhile. "It sure makes 
working here a whole lot nicer."

Fun apparently can prove more elusive for managers than for those they 
supervise. Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm based in Lincolnshire, 
Ill., found that 18% of rank-and-file workers at an accounting company viewed 
having fun as one of six important motivators on the job. And 83% of those 
employees said they were satisfied with the level of fun in their jobs.

Among executives, 29% picked having fun as one of six important motivators, but 
only 72% of them were satisfied with the degree of fun in their work. MARTHA

Rancho Santiago's returning offensive standouts -- quarterback Scott Wood and 
wide receiver Paul Peters -- received plenty of attention in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
And right on cue, both had outstanding games as Rancho Santiago defeated 
Citrus, 34-14, Saturday before 1,000 at Santa Ana Stadium in the Dons' 
season-opener. 
</P>
<P>
The duo, however, became a trio when freshman Estrus Crayton rushed into the 
spotlight. Crayton, an all-Orange County running back from Santa Ana High 
School, scored three touchdowns, two rushing and one on a pass play. 
</P>
<P>
He finished with 100 yards rushing in 15 carries and added 67 yards receiving 
in two catches. He had touchdown runs of two and five yards in the first half, 
but his most impressive performance came on a 57-yard scoring pass from Wood. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton caught the ball at about the line of scrimmage on a quick out, used a 
couple blocks to get into the open, broke two tackles and raced along the 
sidelines for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I spun off of one tackle, slipped another and after that, I was gone," Crayton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, a sophomore quarterback, was 14 of 22 for 301 yards and three touchdowns. 
He was especially effective in the first half when Rancho Santiago opened a 
34-7 lead. Wood completed 13 of 16 for 290 yards and all three touchdowns. 
Eleven of his 13 first-half completions were for 10 yards or more. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, a sophomore wide receiver, had five catches for 134 yards, including a 
touchdown. He had 22 yards rushing and 69 yards in three kickoff returns. 
</P>
<P>
Peters and Wood teammed for a 45-yard scoring pass in the second half. Peters 
caught the ball at the Citrus 20, broke two tackles and ducked under another 
would-be tackler on his way to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aces played really well tonight," Rancho Santiago Coach Dave Ogas said. 
"Wood, Peters and Crayton all did an outstanding job. So did the coaches. I'm 
just sort of the middle man around here." 
</P>
<P>
Citrus' only score came in the first quarter on Paul Clark's 53-yard run. That 
gave Citrus (0-2) a 7-6 lead with 4:12 left in the first quarter. But Crayton 
scored on a five-yard run less than two minutes later to give Rancho Santiago 
the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago shifted in new players midway through the third quarter and all 
the starters were gone by the start of the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
The Owls got the final score of the game on a four-yard touchdown run by Matt 
Yantz with 3:03 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Peters fumbled the ensuing kickoff with Citrus recovering, but the Owls went 
backward and and ended with a fourth and 23. The punt by Tucker Sides went all 
of six yards and ended up in the second row of the visiting stands, good for 
six yards. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast College 31, Rio Hondo 14 -- Joe Fumi-Fiamawle's 62-yard 
interception return for a touchdown sparked host Orange Coast to a 25-14 lead 
early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Rio Hondo's Francisco Barillas fumbled at the Rio Hondo 24 and 
Orange Coast scored six plays later, on Mike Baez's two-yard run, to put the 
game away. Baez finished with two touchdowns and 102 yards in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast quarterback Greg Angelovic completed 13 of 19 passes for 163 yards 
and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mesa 17, Saddleback 7 -- Sophomore quarterback Scott Allen came off 
the bench to pass for 162 yards and two touchdowns for San Diego Mesa at 
Saddleback. Allen replaced Mesa's Lance Lowery, who left the game with a knee 
injury after the second play. Allen was 10 of 20, and had touchdown passes of 
five and 23-yards in the fourth quarter. Saddleback was led by sophomore 
tailback John Burns, who rushed for 175 yards in 25 carries.

AQUINAS' RALLY EDGES ORANGE LUTHERAN, 21-19 
</P>

<P>
Quarterback Ray Reyes threw a 73-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Angel 
Nunez with 4:45 remaining to give Aquinas High School a 21-19 nonleague victory 
over Orange Lutheran Saturday in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes' third touchdown pass helped Aquinas erase a 19-14 deficit. The Falcons 
scored twice in the final eight minutes of play after their offense sputtered 
most of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran (1-1) played most of the second half without star running back 
Gil Greene, who aggravated a bruised right shoulder suffered last week against 
Pater Noster. Greene gained 104 yards in the first half but had only nine 
carries for 57 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Greene returned to play late in the fourth quarter after Aquinas had taken a 
14-13 lead on Reyes' screen pass to halfback Jay Husfloen that Husfloen turned 
into a 70-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
Greene returned the ensuing kickoff 36 yards, then ran 32 yards to set up his 
one-yard touchdown run with 5:39 left to play. But it took Aquinas less than a 
minute to regain the lead when Reyes found Nunez open at midfield and Nunez 
beat two defenders to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Mike Reisbig, Aquinas' 29-year-old rookie coach, said the winning 
play was an audible that Reyes called at the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was supposed to be a hitch-and-pitch pass, but Reyes called a streak and 
Nunez beat both defenders," Reisbig said. "I knew we could win. We finally just 
went out and did it." 
</P>
<P>
Aquinas (1-1) lost its season opener, 14-13, to Rim of the World last week when 
it failed on a two-point conversion pass. On Saturday, Orange Lutheran lost 
when it failed to convert a pair of PAT kicks. 
</P>
<P>
"The fourth quarter was full of big plays," said Bob Dowding, Orange Lutheran 
coach. "I thought Greene really ran with intensity when we got behind in the 
fourth quarter to give us the lead, but then their receiver beat our double 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
Greene finished with 161 yards in 23 carries and scored two touchdowns. He 
rushed for 258 yards last week against Pater Noster and has 419 yards and five 
touchdowns in two games. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes was inconsistent but piled up some big numbers, completing 10 of 25 pass 
attempts for 227 yards and three touchdowns. He also was intercepted three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Norte Vista 29, Laguna Beach 22 -- Jermane Drake's 65-yard run in the third 
quarter gave Norte Vista a 23-22 lead at Riverside City College. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach (0-2) had led up to that point behind the passing of Aaron Scheid, 
who completed 15 of 28 passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns. But the Artists 
could only manage 33 rushing yards for the game, minus 20 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Mallet scored twice for Laguna Beach on a one-yard run in the first 
quarter and a 15-yard pass reception in the third quarter.

REDEMPTION RATE FOR RECYCLED CANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I agree with your editorial ("Definitely Worth a Toast!" Sept. 4) that 
consumers deserve "more than a fistful of pennies for their effort" in 
returning soda bottles and empty beer cans, and that the state "should approve 
the nickel reward." But I would suggest an additional piece of legislation 
which immediately upon enactment would eliminate most bottles and cans from our 
parks and roads. Simply stated, require a like number of empty containers to be 
returned at each purchase of full containers. 
</P>
<P>
Thirsty Californians who aren't attracted to returning empties for a redemption 
fee -- no matter how big it gets -- will tote those bottles and cans to make a 
new purchase to quench their thirst.
