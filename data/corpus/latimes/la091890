L.A. AND OTHER CITIES SOFTEN CENSUS UNDERCOUNT CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
After complaining that preliminary 1990 census figures grossly underestimated 
the growth of their populations over the past decade, officials in many big 
cities -- including Los Angeles -- say that census counts may not be quite as 
far off as the critics originally alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, officials in Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and other 
metropolitan areas continue to say that there were serious errors in the Census 
Bureau's population count, which could cost local governments seats in Congress 
and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
In an official challenge forwarded to Washington late Monday, Los Angeles 
officials said they had turned up 49,513 more dwellings than the 1.3 million 
units counted by the Census Bureau. While that difference of 3.8% could 
translate into thousands of people and millions of dollars in government aid, 
the figure is well below the 10% housing underestimate Los Angeles officials 
had originally predicted. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, the Census Bureau has put the city's 1990 population at 3.42 
million -- 15% above the 1980 level. But the challenge over housing units, when 
translated into residents, could bring that figure up by 123,783 -- a total 
about equal to the population of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of missing anyone who resides in the Los Angeles area can have 
a devastating impact on the federal funds we may receive to provide needed city 
services," Mayor Tom Bradley said from Frankfurt, West Germany, while on a 
mission to promote tourism. 
</P>
<P>
During the remainder of this week, cities and towns across the country will be 
scurrying to complete formal responses to the initial census figures. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, city officials said late Monday that they suspect the preliminary 
Census Bureau figures -- which had accounted for 428,618 housing units -- are 1 
1/2% to 2% low. 
</P>
<P>
The comparison was due to be completed by late today, said Joey Perry, a senior 
city planner. 
</P>
<P>
"We are finding housing units they're missing," Perry said. "I'm not certain 
we're finding that 1 1/2% to 2%. I'm hoping we are. But we're still in the 
midst of doing our research on this." 
</P>
<P>
The city is comparing every block in town where it believes the bureau has 
undercounted by 15 or more housing units, Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
The check does not involve much door-to-door footwork, she said. Instead, the 
city is matching the figures against its own list of housing units per land 
parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary figures put the city's 1990 population at 1,094,524 and the 
county's at 2,465,961, said Pat Chriss, the bureau's San Diego district office 
manager. The final 1980 count for the city of San Diego was 875,538, according 
to the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Chriss said she had not heard criticism that the San Diego counts were far too 
low. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Perry said, the city had estimated its population at 
1,118,282 -- or 2% higher than the preliminary census count of 1,094,524. 
</P>
<P>
County planners were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last week, the Census Bureau had received formal responses 
from 4,341, or 11%, of all local governments, but not all have formally 
challenged the census numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've actually received a lot of letters here accepting our counts, telling us 
we were right in the ball park," said Denise Smith, an official in the Census 
Bureau's regional office that covers all of New England and Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
In Houston, a week before the deadline, officials were finding the local review 
of housing units much closer to the census count than they had expected. 
Nonetheless, city officials were challenging the Census Bureau's contention 
that Houston has 1.61 million residents and essentially has not grown since 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, officials were disturbed but not surprised by the census 
conclusion that population has eroded over the past decade, with city dwellers 
fleeing in ever-larger numbers to the suburbs. While officials there thought 
the census count was off, they also acknowledged that their numbers were not as 
different as they had thought. Based on earlier estimates, city officials said 
the census had overlooked as many as 97,000 dwellings. In fact, the post-census 
review of building permits and other records showed that the census undercount 
was closer to 67,000 units, said Barbara J. Kaplan, executive director of the 
city Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In a few places, officials continued to say the numbers would be as bad -- and 
in some cases, worse -- than anticipated. In Chicago, a week before the 
deadline, the difference between the census count and the local review was 
"large and growing larger," said Susan Weed, a community development 
demographer. 
</P>
<P>
New York's deadline is also later this week, but officials there continued to 
be outspoken in their criticism of the preliminary census count of 600,000 
fewer residents than the city had a decade ago -- a situation that officials 
say is preposterous, given their large homeless population and the city's 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in Washington last week, Barbara Everitt Bryant, the director of 
the Census Bureau, responded sharply to the New York officials in her first 
public statement since the agency released the preliminary 1990 counts last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
If New York's population did not drop, she said at the hearing, "Why did the 
school enrollment drop by 54,000? Why do the moving vans show more people going 
out than coming in?" 
</P>
<P>
The bureau has until mid-October to assess the challenges, at which time it 
will begin preparing a final gross count of the population, due on the 
President's desk by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
While these operations and last-minute efforts are under way to correct the 
preliminary census count of 245.8 million, census statisticians will be 
evaluating what is known as the post-enumeration survey, a statistical survey 
analyzing how well the regular census did in finding such hard-to-count 
residents as immigrants and inner-city residents.

S.D. WATER-SAVINGS RATE LAGS THIS MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although San Diego saved less water than expected during the first 16 days of 
September, water officials blame last week's mini-heat wave and say mandatory 
water conservation is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been very successful," said Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor, of San Diego's voluntary water conservation program. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, remain unconvinced that a voluntary program will be enough in 
the long run. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner, who supports mandatory conservation and 
is the only council member to oppose O'Connor's voluntary program, said water 
conservation is a long-term dilemma that "we can't come to grips with using 
P.R. techniques." 
</P>
<P>
Filner said water consumers' habits can only be changed permanently through a 
comprehensive program that would include, for example, rebates for reducing 
water consumption, restrictions on lawn watering and requirements that builders 
install water conserving toilets and similar low-usage fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
However, mayoral spokesman Downey said there was no need for San Diego to adopt 
a mandatory program because the city's overall average water savings figure 
this summer is exceeding the 10% goal set by the San Diego County Water 
Authority, which supplies most of the area's water. 
</P>
<P>
City residents used 3% less water than expected from Sept. 1-16, down from 
month-end figures of 12.7% in August, 9.7% in July and 15.3% in June, for an 
overall average of 11.1% since the water conservation program began June 1, 
according to the city's Water Utilities Department. 
</P>
<P>
"The momentum is still going," said Marsi Steirer, a city water conservation 
analyst, of the public's apparent enthusiasm for conserving water. 
</P>
<P>
Some people, primarily new residents, are not aware of the water shortage, but 
public education efforts are reaching average residential consumers, who, 
ultimately, will make or break the conservation program, said Steirer. 
</P>
<P>
She said thousands of San Diegans continue to call the city's water hot line 
each month for conservation tips and to complain about "water abusers." 
</P>
<P>
Complaints have covered everything from leaky irrigation systems to the hosing 
of driveways to children throwing water balloons. One woman was irked that a 
male neighbor -- presumably his window was open -- was showering twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate all calls, but obviously there are some we can't respond to," 
said Steirer. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials cautioned against drawing conclusions about water conservation 
from daily or weekly usage rates, saying month-end and summer-long figures 
provide a more accurate assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Downey attributed the drop-off in savings in September to slightly higher than 
normal temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
He said if heat waves, which have come sporadically this summer, continue or 
grow in intensity and length, "there could be problems, but still people are to 
be congratulated for their water conservation efforts thus far." 
</P>
<P>
"The message is getting out there . . . and we hope people will make permanent 
lifestyle changes always be a problem in Southern California," Downey added. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Weather 
</P>
<P>
Service, the area rainfall has been about normal and temperatures slightly 
above normal this summer. The long-term forecast calls for more of the same 
typical hot, dry San Diego weather with a 60% chance that temperatures will be 
slightly above normal the next few months, said forecaster Richard Stitt. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember that we're dealing with a normally dry climate anyway, 
and the more people and growth you add, even with average rainfall, you'd be 
putting a strain on the existing water supply," Stitt added. 
</P>
<P>
The city's 11.1% overall savings slightly exceeds the countywide average 
savings rate of about 10% for all cities and water districts, said Jim Melton, 
spokesman for the county water authority. San Diego is the only municipality of 
23 cities in the county that has not adopted a mandatory program. 
</P>
<P>
Final figures for many cities for August and September were not available, but 
in July, San Diego used 9.7% less water than expected, putting its savings rate 
ahead of some cities and water districts but below others. For example, Padre 
Dam and Rincon del Diablo had water reduction rates that month of 5% and 9.5%, 
respectively, while some of the bigger savers included Otay Mesa at 21.7% and 
Ramona at 14.6%. 
</P>
<P>
"It has not made much of a difference" in water usage whether a city has a 
mandatory or voluntary conservation program, said Melton. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory measures, which have resulted in few fines this summer across the 
county, were adopted largely to emphasize the importance of water conservation 
and to discourage blatant water wasting, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Filner questioned the accuracy of the city's water-usage figures, saying he was 
suspicious of the method used to calculate savings. The city compares current 
water usage not to 1989 figures but to numbers calculated by averaging water 
usage totals for the past five years and then factoring in increases due to 
population growth. 
</P>
<P>
City utilities officials, however, said the formula is the most accurate way to 
calculate water savings because it takes into account temperatures, rainfall 
and water usage that fluctuates from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thirsty September 
</P>
<P>
Early September's heat wave brought a marked downturn in San Diego water 
conservation, which fell far short of the 10% sought by city officials during 
that period.

MIDDLE EAST SCHOLARS FIND RELEVANCE IN THE PAST; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: TURKISH AND ISRAELI PROFESSORS GIVE ATTENTIVE STUDENTS STRONG 
BACKGROUND IN THE REGION'S HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The arrival this summer of Hasan Kayali at UC San Diego and Meir Zamir at San 
Diego State University could not have been timed better. 
</P>
<P>
The two Middle East scholars are finding that the last six weeks' events in 
Kuwait and the Arabian Peninsula have provided a compelling backdrop to their 
modern history courses on the region. 
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-born Kayali was recruited to the UCSD department of history as its 
first Middle East specialist, both to design courses in the subject area and to 
strengthen the university's research efforts as part of a possible future 
Middle East studies program. While only 20 undergraduates pre-registered for 
his initial course (tracing the Middle East from the year 1600 to the present), 
that was before the Iraq crisis erupted, and Kayali expects more students to 
show up when classes begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Since this is a very politicized subject, I expect many students will come 
with preconceptions," Kayali said. "I want to give them an opportunity to 
re-examine what they think, to re-evaluate their views, to alert them to the 
diversity in the Middle East, and to caution them against going with easy 
generalizations." 
</P>
<P>
Zamir, an Israeli professor who holds a guest history chair for the 1990-91 
year at San Diego State, was forced because of limited classroom size to turn 
away more than 40 students from his modern Middle East history course, which 
began late last month. 
</P>
<P>
The 40 students who qualified for the class by registering ahead of time are 
much more attentive than those he taught in a similar class during a guest 
professorship in 1988-89, Zamir said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that the students are certainly much more attuned to the 
complexity of the situation, that despite the tendency of American students to 
be without patience for history, they know today they need serious, not 
instant, study of the past in order to make sense of the present," said Zamir, 
a historian from Ben Gurion University in Beersheba, Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Zamir assigns what he calls "heavy, heavy readings" because he finds most 
American students have so little background about the Middle East "that most 
don't even know the maps." 
</P>
<P>
Zamir added, "So far I don't see any 'Rambo' attitude among these students," 
contrary to media reports and public opinion polls suggesting that Americans 
favor military action against the Iraqi regime. 
</P>
<P>
Kayali, who comes to his assistant professor post from the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, also stressed the importance of learning the 
historical antecedents of contemporary Middle Eastern politics and culture. 
</P>
<P>
"Students are going to be disappointed if they take the course just as a 
substitute for reading the papers, as sort of a current events course," Kayali 
said, although he will make copies of news articles for students to discuss in 
the context of historical patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not offering instant analysis of current events, so I want students to be 
interested in learning history as a tool to figure out the present." 
</P>
<P>
But Kayali is confident that studying the sweep of Middle East history over the 
past 300 years can intrigue students enough that they will go beyond the 
insights they gain into how to view the present American military role on the 
Arabian Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the historical claims that Iraq has had on Kuwait, the sectarian 
divisions in Muslim societies, both in Iraq and elsewhere, the meaning of the 
Islamic revival, the explanations of terms such as Shiite (Muslims) and Sunni 
(Muslims), as well as the substance of and historical precedents for Islamic 
resurgence," Kayali said. 
</P>
<P>
Kayali, who earned both his undergraduate degree and doctorate from Harvard 
University, returned to the United States only last week from a summer in 
Turkey, where among other things he was buying books to augment a budding 
Middle East collection at the UCSD research library. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lots of concern in Turkey that the country will be dragged into an 
active conflict with Iraq," Kayali said, adding that the gung-ho support by 
Americans for action in the Middle East -- as reflected in public opinion polls 
-- is not necessarily shared in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no support for Saddam Hussein, but there's fear of a war because we 
have to live with him or whomever comes next," Kayali said. His father was 
sufficiently worried about a possible mobilization of Turkish citizens that he 
urged his son to return to the United States as early as possible, Kayali said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kayali and Zamir see their "outsider" status as foreign-born scholars a 
plus in teaching the present courses. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I come from the region, the fact that I am more attuned to the 
region, I think that makes it helpful," said Zamir, who also has taught at 
Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not teaching the course as it is usually taught in the U.S., with an 
emphasis on present political systems, but rather I'm looking at internal 
changes within the region and at its own development. . . . I want to get away 
from the jargon of international politics and superpower relations -- things 
that Americans like very much." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Kayali nor Zamir wants to push his own view of the present crisis on 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Kayali, in demurring on giving his opinion, said that, once his students plow 
their way through the region's history, "they'll have as good an opinion as I 
do, and that is an aim of the course."

ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AT STAKE AT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego County lawsuit that seeks to increase state funding for local 
mental health programs begins today in Superior Court in a trial that could 
have far-reaching implications in the way these funds are distributed 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
County officials hope the lawsuit will force the state Department of Mental 
Health to allocate funds according to population. Opponents of the lawsuit, 
which include several other counties, said that funding formulas should remain 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents argue that San Diego County receives less money because local 
officials did not bother to establish an effective mental health program in the 
1960s and early 1970s, when funding for these programs was plentiful. The 
county is now paying for its inaction and lack of vision, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy county counsel Michael Poynor brushed the opponents' arguments aside and 
said the "bottom line" is that the state uses "an unequal historical" method to 
allocate mental health funds, based on how much the counties received more than 
30 years ago, that has put San Diego County at a severe disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
Although San Diego is the second-largest county in the state, it ranks near the 
bottom of California's 58 counties in funding it receives for mental health 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate goal is to have the judge declare the state scheme for funding 
mental health unconstitutional," Poynor said. "We're going to ask for an order 
to the Legislature to reallocate funds on a reasonable basis among the 58 
counties." 
</P>
<P>
According to Poynor's figures, counties receive an average of $28 per person 
for mental health care from the state. San Diego County's share actually comes 
out to $19 per person, he said. By comparison, San Francisco, which has 
one-third the population of San Diego County, receives $62 per person, Poynor 
added. 
</P>
<P>
County officials estimated that San Diego County has lost up to $18 million a 
year in state funding for the mentally ill since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The root of the problem dates back to 1957, Poynor said. In 1957, when counties 
began applying to the state for funds to run their mental health programs, San 
Diego chose not to participate because it was building a 100-bed county 
facility. At the time, San Diego County was the only county in the state to own 
its own mental health facility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, when San Diego County decided to begin applying for state funds, "the 
other counties had gotten a head start" and had their state-funded programs in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"This head start has remained a key advantage for them ever since," Poynor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to having the state's funding formula declared unconstitutional, 
Poynor said the lawsuit also seeks a refund or credit of $20 million from the 
state. The state has withheld that much from the county for using more than its 
share of beds in state-run mental hospitals over the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's another example of inequality. The state has allocated San Diego, with 
2.5 million people, to use 31 hospital beds free of charge. San Francisco is 
entitled to use 240 beds," Poynor said. 
</P>
<P>
However, opponents of the lawsuit remain unconvinced by the county's argument. 
</P>
<P>
"They (San Diego County) are basically trying to take money from counties with 
long-established mental health programs," said Stewart Foreman, San Francisco 
deputy city attorney. "They got into the program late, at a time when funding 
limits, because of Proposition 13 and other considerations, have made it 
impossible from a political standpoint to put more money into the system." 
</P>
<P>
Smaller counties, such as San Francisco, and larger counties, such as Los 
Angeles, get more money because they have established programs and need the 
funds more, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman represents nine counties, including Los Angeles County, who have sided 
with the attorney general's office to defeat the lawsuit. Both Foreman and 
Deputy Att. Gen. John Venegas, who is representing the state Department of 
Mental Health in the lawsuit, said the complaint is "without merit." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit will be heard in a non-jury trial by Superior Court Judge Barbara 
Gamer and is actually a consolidation of two lawsuits filed by the county 
against the state since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Fresno County officials agreed to consolidate a similar lawsuit 
they had filed against the state with the complaint filed by San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Venegas said he will argue that the state has been allocating the funds 
according to the Legislature's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego's share of funds was allocated by the Legislature," said Venegas. 
"The state Department of Mental Health has followed what the legislature told 
it to do." 
</P>
<P>
If San Diego County wants to get the funding formula changed, it should go to 
the Legislature rather than try to change it in court, Venegas argued. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that what San Diego is complaining about is not for the courts to 
decide," Venegas said. Poynor said the state is also violating existing law by 
allocating less money to under-funded counties like San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We view current law as saying when new money comes into the state mental 
health budget, it should go to counties that are below the state average. . . . 
The state continues to take new money, almost half of it, and give it to 
counties already above the state average," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the state's cutback in mental health funding this year put San 
Diego County's funding somewhat more in line with other counties. Of the $61 
million cut by the governor statewide, San Fancisco lost $12 million, while San 
Diego suffered only a $500,000 cut.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego Superior Court judge became a prosecution witness Monday when he 
testified that a temporary restraining order sought by Sagon Penn against his 
former girlfriend was altered after the judge had signed it. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Wesley Mason told Municipal Judge Patricia Cowett that Penn, 28, met with 
him in chambers Aug. 17 when Penn acted as his own attorney and won an order 
prohibiting Penn's former girlfriend from contacting him.

After signing the temporary restraining order against Donna Parks, the judge 
said later that day he noticed that someone had written that Parks must not 
contact Maurice Bell, her new boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"The name Maurice Bell did not appear when I first saw the documents," Mason 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
Mason said he would not have signed such a document. 
</P>
<P>
Cowett ordered Penn to stand trial on two felony counts of submitting a false 
court document and to a misdemeanor battery charge involving an incident with 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Penn, who posted $15,000 bail several weeks ago following his arrest in the 
courthouse, was ordered to return to court Oct. 1 for setting a trial date. 
</P>
<P>
Penn was acquitted in two trials in 1986 and 1987 of murder, manslaughter, 
attempted murder and assault in the 1985 shootings of San Diego Police Officer 
Thomas Riggs, who was killed, and the wounding of officer Donovan Jacobs and 
civilian ride-along Sarah Pina-Ruiz. Penn, who is black, had claimed the 
shootings were sparked by racial comments by Jacobs, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
Penn's attorney, Jeff Thoma, told the court Monday that Penn has changed his 
name to Meecee Parks.

<TEXT>
<P>
Three men were wounded by gunfire while standing outside a National City 
restaurant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The three were near the front door of the Thai Bar B Q restaurant in the 3400 
block of East Plaza Boulevard when they were hit early Sunday morning, Sgt. 
Carey Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Two cars pulled into the restaurant's parking lot and at least three people got 
out of the cars and started shooting, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Bullet casings were found at the scene and a white Toyota MR-2 and a white 
Toyota Celica were seen leaving the parking lot at the time of the shooting, 
said Officer Michael Harlan. 
</P>
<P>
Souphy Phongsavath, 20, of Fullerton was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, 
suffering from a bullet wound to the back. A hospital spokeswoman said she 
could not release any information about Phongsavath. 
</P>
<P>
Two others, 22-year-old Kongkham Daravong of Anaheim, who suffered a minor 
wound to the face, and 30-year-old Soukanyastue Hansana of La Puente, who 
suffered minor wounds to both legs, were treated and released from Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in Chula Vista.

A portion of Ocean Beach, closed along with Mission Beach by a sewage spill 
Friday, could open again by the middle of the week after more tests to measure 
the water's bacteria level.

Mission Beach has reopened, but Ocean Beach is still closed from the Mission 
Bay Channel to just south of the Ocean Beach Pier, said Sgt. Steve de Bry of 
the San Diego city lifeguard service.

The spill occurred when a pipe carrying sewage from the Point Loma treatment

WATER PIPELINE BID APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bid to construct an 11-mile-long, $75 million water pipeline through Las 
Posas Mountain and San Marcos was awarded Monday by the San Diego County Water 
Authority to a Vancouver, Wash., company. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials say that when the nine-foot-diameter, steel pipeline becomes 
operational -- two years from now -- it will allow the wholesale water purveyor 
to buy an additional 5% more water for distribution to the 25 public water 
agencies it supplies throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
The new pipeline will also help the County Water Authority better distribute 
water throughout the county, said senior civil engineer Gary Stine. 
</P>
<P>
The new pipeline will connect to an existing California Aqueduct pipeline about 
five miles north of San Marcos, travel through the Twin Oaks Valley and run 
through a 1,685-foot-long tunnel to be blasted through Las Posas Mountain on 
San Marcos' south side. The pipeline will then reconnect to the main water 
artery near Questhaven Road in the Elfin Forest area, Stine said. 
</P>
<P>
The bid was awarded to Kiewit Pacific Company, one of five competitors for the 
two-year construction project expected to begin in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
Stine likened the additional pipeline to the construction of a freeway to 
parallel an existing one, saying it will allow the water authority to more 
efficiently distribute water to the water agencies that buy water from the 
wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
Some water reservoirs in the county occasionally run low on water because of 
distribution problems that will be corrected with the new pipeline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The pipeline will have the capability to carry 400 million gallons of water per 
day, Stine said.

EXTRADITION OF DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your Aug. 13 editorial, "Judicial Reversal, Political Problem," you suggest 
that the United States could request the formal extradition of Dr. Humberto 
Alvarez Machain, who has been indicted in connection with the torture-murder of 
Drug Enforcement Special Agent Enrique Camarena. Although the U.S. and Mexico 
have entered into an extradition treaty, that agreement does not upset Mexican 
law or the historic interpretation of that law by Mexican officials. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest problem in our extradition relations with Mexico is that Mexico 
does not extradite its citizens to face criminal charges brought in the U.S. 
Pursuant to Mexican law, extradition of its citizens is barred except in 
"exceptional cases." We know of no instance in which this has occurred, nor are 
we aware of what Mexico might view as circumstances sufficient to justify the 
exercise of this authority. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the extradition option you raise is not available to the United 
States in order to bring Dr. Alvarez Machain to trial.

THE MOSQUE NO ONE WANTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would be hard to find a more cooperative group than the folks representing 
the Islamic Center of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, they complied with a city requirement that called for their 
proposed mosque to "blend in" with a Granada Hills neighborhood. That meant a 
Spanish-style mosque without the traditional domes or minarets. 
</P>
<P>
But even after that concession, the city still slapped the mosque with 44 
conditions for approval -- the highest number of restrictions ever placed on a 
house of worship in Los Angeles. Taken all together, these actions raise 
disturbing questions about government infringement on religious freedom. In an 
increasingly diverse Los Angeles, the restrictions also raise disturbing 
questions about why there was so much opposition to the construction of the 
mosque. Was it just a matter of too many people -- or what kind of people? 
</P>
<P>
Quite rightly, Mayor Tom Bradley now asks the city to consider whether there 
should be any design restrictions for religious buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the Islamic Center wanted to build a new house of worship and a 
social hall for 550 people. A "conditional use permit" to allow construction in 
a residential area was granted, but appealed. The mosque was inappropriate for 
that location, opponents said, and would bring in too much traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The council granted the permit. But with it came a list of requirements, 
including a notice advising worshipers not to park in the neighborhood plus a 
limit on membership. The mosque cannot have more than 250 members in the first 
year. The number could be increased to 400 later -- subject to city review. 
</P>
<P>
Project opponents said their objections were strictly environmental. Yet when a 
church, about a block away, recently wanted to add a floor to its school to 
make room for another 150 children, approval came without controversy. 
</P>
<P>
There could well be legitimate reasons for the two different community 
responses; in any case, the Islamic Center says it plans no appeals. Now, a 
spokesman said, they just want to move forward, with all the restrictions, and 
show the city that they can be good neighbors. But it's a shame they now feel 
they have to prove that.

BUSH'S SPEECH ON U.S. GOALS IN MIDDLE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Listening to the addresses of President Bush and of the Democratic Party right 
after, I was angered by the similarity and at the lack of alternative thinking 
that the major political parties engage in. I believe the world situation is 
not being presented with any clarity. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, our moral position in the Persian Gulf is a joke. In recent 
memory, we have invaded small nations in our own hemisphere in violation of 
international law. The U.S. faces up to aggression only when it is in the 
economic interests of our capital-gains-taking ruling class. 
</P>
<P>
Why did neither political party make any mention of solar energy as a viable 
alternative? Some say it is not economically feasible. But is our massive troop 
deployment economically feasible? Is the savings and loan bailout sound 
economic policy? Is subsidizing the nuclear power industry, which has proved 
unprofitable, cost effective? When will we realize that capital gains tax 
breaks and subsidies to big companies amount to the public giving the wealthy 
more wealth -- a welfare check to industry.

BUSH'S SPEECH ON U.S. GOALS IN MIDDLE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After weighing everything -- the pros and cons -- I'm convinced that the 
popular consensus is for massive U.S. military action in the Persian Gulf. 
George Bush should not wait any longer. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think anybody will question if the U.S. goes ahead and takes out Saddam 
Hussein. The man is cancer and should be removed before it spreads. Of course 
lives will be lost, including our own troops. But that's the price for being 
the symbol of democracy and protector of the weak. 
</P>
<P>
The embargo is good only in principle. It will take too long to be effective. 
In the meantime, the clock is ticking towards recession and hard times. 
</P>
<P>
Two things will happen if the President does not act now: He can kiss his 
reelection goodby and Hussein will remain the crazy goon of the Arab world.

BUSH'S SPEECH ON U.S. GOALS IN MIDDLE EAST

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that our troops are deployed in force in the Persian Gulf area, what are 
our leaders saying? 
</P>
<P>
In his address to Congress and the nation, President Bush said that we will 
stand by our friends (Saudi Arabia and so on). 
</P>
<P>
Henry Kissinger, a former leader, has said that nations don't have friends; 
they have interests. The President says that we are ready to check aggression 
as such. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James Baker says that we should be patient during this 
crisis. Congressmen say that some nations who are supposed to be on our side 
should put their money where their troops are not. 
</P>
<P>
The buzz out of the Pentagon is that the brass is saying things like rotating 
troops in and out of the Persian Gulf area, although Bush says that Saddam 
Hussein has to get out of Kuwait immediately. 
</P>
<P>
What our leaders are not saying is that if the national energy policy proposed 
by the Ford Administration in 1975 had been implemented, our men and women in 
uniform wouldn't be in the Persian Gulf area in the first place.

CRIME: A WESTMINISTER POLICE OFFICER BOUGHT A REPLACEMENT BIKE FOR A 
HANDICAPPED VIETNAMESE WOMAN AFTER HER ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION HAD BEEN 
STOLEN.

<TEXT>
<P>
Anh Thi Nguyen, a 36-year-old Vietnamese woman who can neither speak nor hear, 
cried last week when her bike was stolen from a Huntington Beach shopping 
center. It was her only transportation and, without it, she felt stranded. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday she was riding again, this time on a red Univega five-speed bought 
for her by a sympathetic Westminster police officer, whose act of generosity 
has won him the family's loyalty and who is now known by the Nguyens as a 
"savior." 
</P>
<P>
"With her handicap, she never thought anybody would be nice to her," her 
mother, Luc Thi Nguyen, said though an interpreter Monday. "And now she 
realizes there are people who are nice to her." 
</P>
<P>
Officer Robert Trotter, an eight-year veteran of the force who has spent the 
past three years working in Little Saigon, said his heart went out to the woman 
after he learned of the theft. 
</P>
<P>
"It was her only method of transportation. She feels kind of lost without it," 
Trotter said. "Given her culture and her handicap . . . job opportunities are 
real limited. I wanted to help her in some way -- hopefully restore her faith 
in society, too." 
</P>
<P>
For Trotter, it was a handwritten note, scrawled in broken English, that 
brought his attention to the crime and how much it had pained Anh Thi Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like you to pay attention of my bicycle," read the note, which Luc Thi 
Nguyen wrote for her daughter. "I hope you help me about that, because I don't 
have the auto. I use only my bicycle for go to market or shopping." 
</P>
<P>
The note came with a drawing of the stolen bike, which has not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"After reading the letter and seeing Anh, I thought the best thing to do was to 
get her another bike as soon as possible. It kind of touched me and I felt I 
had to do something a little extra," Trotter said. "I got into police work to 
help people. And I felt she needed a little extra help." 
</P>
<P>
Worried that a charitable organization would take too long to replace Anh 
Nguyen's cherished bicycle, Trotter took it on himself to come up with $75 for 
a replacement. He presented it to her Monday at the Westminster police station, 
and she accepted it nervously as her mother gushed with gratitude and reporters 
looked on. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like a savior to us for doing this for our daughter," said Luc Thi 
Nguyen, who immigrated to the United States from Vietnam six years ago and came 
to Westminster last year. "She won't forget him. She considers him a real 
friend."

COLD WAR'S OVER, SUPERCOP CAN GO HOME; 
</P>
<P>
GEOPOLITICS: OUR VITAL INTERESTS CAN'T BE HARMED BY IRAQ, SO AMERICA SHOULD 
STOP BEING THE GLOBAL PROTECTOR. LET THOSE THREATENED TAKE ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER LAYNE, Christopher Layne is a Los Angeles attorney and an 
adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Persian Gulf may indeed be the first worldwide crisis of the post-Cold-War 
era, but it is clear that American foreign policy is still driven by Cold War 
thinking -- the same vision of "world order" politics that has shaped U.S. 
foreign policy since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental question of statecraft is this: What are the nation's vital 
interests -- those for which it will risk war? Following in the footsteps of 
their Cold Warrior mentors, today's war hawks have a simple answer: Any 
aggression anywhere vitally affects American interests. Like Woodrow Wilson, 
these hawks believe that democracies are responsible for maintaining world 
peace by opposing aggressors and overthrowing dictators. They believe that 
America must play global policeman because no other nation can uphold U.S. 
concepts of international law, freedom and political stability. 
</P>
<P>
World-order politics was superficially plausible during the Cold War, when it 
could be argued that any Soviet gain was a U.S. defeat, but it makes little 
sense in today's world. Communism has collapsed and the Soviet Union has been 
marginalized as a geopolitical factor. And as the Helsinki summit demonstrates, 
the superpowers are moving from enmity to entente. 
</P>
<P>
A multipolar system marked by the spread of economic and military power to 
other nations is emerging. Cold War bipolarity has been replaced by a more 
nuanced international system in which North-South issues and Third World 
nationalism are at the fore. In today's world, most regions are of 
strategically peripheral importance to the United States, and other nations are 
capable of upholding regional power balances. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to see the world as it really is, and the first step is to stop 
using the concept of vital interests promiscuously. Because of its geographic 
position, large nuclear arsenal and strength in all indicators of great-power 
status, the United States has few truly vital interests to defend in the world. 
The United States cannot be indifferent to events abroad, but it can afford to 
react deliberately to them precisely because it is a superpower, insulated from 
most global trouble spots and not directly affected by world instability. 
</P>
<P>
America's ideals may be offended by Iraq, but its vital interests -- physical 
security and territorial integrity -- are not. The Munich analogy's trite 
cliches are irrelevant to the Persian Gulf crisis. Even if Saddam Hussein is 
another Hitler, Iraq is not another Nazi Germany. Hitler controlled a powerful 
nation of 80 million people with a first-class economy and military capable of 
upsetting the world balance of power and possibly threatening America. Iraq has 
no such capability. It might be different if Iraq had nuclear weapons. But it 
will not for some years, and Iraq can be prevented from becoming a nuclear 
power without risking a major Middle Eastern land war. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq doesn't threaten vital American interests, but it is a clear and present 
danger to Western Europe and Japan -- which depend to a far greater extent on 
Persian Gulf oil -- and other Middle Eastern powers -- which figure to be 
Saddam Hussein's next victims. Yet the United States is bearing the brunt of 
containing Iraq, calling up reserves and deploying 200,000 ground troops to 
Saudi Arabia. Only France and Britain in all of Western Europe have sent or 
promised troops, and Japan has only recently and grudgingly promised even 
financial assistance. Friendly Arab states are providing mainly token forces. 
But Washington's complaints that our allies aren't doing their "fair share" are 
incongruous, coming from those who urged Washington to plunge into the Persian 
Gulf. By playing world policeman, the United States gives other nations a 
strong incentive to ride for free on America's back. If other nations know that 
America is going to assume the risks and costs of defending their interests, it 
makes sense for them to let America do so. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of global interventionism, Washington should adopt a policy of 
strategic independence. America's objective should be burden-shifting, not 
burden-sharing. While being prepared to back up collective defense with 
logistic support and limited air and naval power, the United States should not 
be the point man in every international crisis. Our soldiers are not Hessians. 
</P>
<P>
The United States should make it clear to our allies that monetary 
contributions to U.S. security efforts are not enough: Those with the most at 
stake must bear the primary responsibility for defending their interests with 
troops on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Evil leaders like Saddam Hussein and evil political systems abound in the 
world. Regrettably, war and aggression are longstanding facts of international 
life. Remaking the world is a noble goal, but policies must be based on their 
consequences, not the intentions underlying them. The chimerical pursuit of 
world order means endless interventionist crusades in faraway lands; a 
permanent national-security state and bloated military Establishment and the 
neglect of pressing economic and domestic problems while we continue defending 
those who should be defending themselves. In the Middle East, the United States 
is risking its soldiers' lives and spending $46 million a day to keep oil 
flowing to economic rivals like Japan, so their factories can keep making 
products and putting Americans out of work. 
</P>
<P>
World-order politics will not work in the perennially unstable and semifeudal 
Middle East, where the only possible outcomes are prolonged stalemate, 
diplomatic defeat or a bloody armed conflict. There are limits to American 
power and we must learn to live with a diverse and unstable world. Here, the 
lessons of Vietnam should be remembered, not dismissed. Even superpowers are 
not omnipotent, and the United States lacks the material, psychological and 
spiritual resources to reshape, or to impose order on, a fractious and unruly 
world -- a grandiose ambition far exceeding the defense of vital American 
interests.

COMPETITION, NOT LIMITATION, IS THE ANSWER; 
</P>
<P>
TERM LIMITS: THE CONSEQUENCE WILL BE INCREASED STAFF POWER -- A CURE WORSE THAN 
THE DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID S. BRODER, David S. Broder is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1978, the vote on Proposition 13, California's tax-limitation initiative, 
ushered in a revolt against big government that shaped the politics of the 
'80s. Today, Oklahoma will vote on an initiative to limit terms in office, 
which may signal a revolt that shakes up the politics of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative is a product -- and symptom -- of growing public disillusionment 
with politics as usual. Polls indicate overwhelming public support for the 
measure, which would put a 12-year limit on service in the state House and 
Senate. Similar measures will be on the California and Colorado ballots in 
November. Supporters of these measures are talking about pushing such proposals 
in a dozen other states by 1992 and are aiming at limiting congressional tenure 
as well. Democrats, whose party controls Congress, seem just as eager as 
Republicans to shuffle the deck. 
</P>
<P>
While the support is broad and nonpartisan, the impetus for term limitation 
comes from people in the business world -- both mavericks and Establishment 
types -- who are frustrated in their desire to cut spending and regulation by 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Republican state Sen. Terry Considine is the sponsor of the Colorado 
initiative. An entrepreneur, he has served in the Legislature for three years, 
just long enough to convince him that no one should serve more than eight. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been a GOP activist and fund-raiser for many years, his 
motivation cannot be dismissed as purely partisan. As he points out, his party 
has a solid hold on both houses of the Colorado Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Considine says he is convinced that term limits will encourage better people to 
seek office and pave the way for passage of other reforms -- including steps to 
make legislative and congressional districts more competitive and reduce 
incumbents' advantages in financing their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
I think that he and the other term-limitation people have got the cart before 
the horse. What we need are competitive elections, not arbitrary limits on 
service. The unintended consequence of term limits will be to increase the 
power of unelected officials -- legislative staffs and executive branch 
bureaucrats. Their expertise will become even more influential when the elected 
officials are all short-timers, and their arrogance will grow. 
</P>
<P>
But that kind of argument is not going to slow this freight train. The 
incumbents at both state and national levels are too obviously guilty of 
feathering their own nests for the public to see that it really has a stake in 
keeping some of them on the job for more than a few years. The incumbents have 
drawn districts that protect them from challenge. They have collected 
extravagant campaign contributions from the lobbyists who must come to them for 
help. And they have expanded the perquisites of office -- their 
taxpayer-financed staffs and communications -- to such a level that they are 
virtually guaranteed reelection as long as they want the job. 
</P>
<P>
No one can defend a system in which 98% of the incumbents who seek reelection 
to Congress win year after year. No one can defend the Colorado status quo 
where, Considine says, no incumbent elected governor has lost since 1962 and no 
incumbent state senator has been defeated in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
If the incumbents don't recognize the need to permit their challengers to 
compete on more equal terms, their tenure will almost certainly be reduced by 
arbitrary term limits. And those term limits will eliminate the able and 
talented right along with the phonies and the hacks. 
</P>
<P>
And this country will be the loser.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
WANTED: A FULL-TIME MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor announced in January -- one year into a 
four-year term -- that she would not run for reelection, it appeared as if she 
were abdicating her role as mayor. She tried to offset the considerable 
liabilities of such a long lame-duck status by saying it would allow her to 
work more freely for City Hall reforms. 
</P>
<P>
But just eight months later, those reforms have gone nowhere. Last week, in a 
sort-of midyear State of the City address, O'Connor said that the "San Diego 
tradition of stability, civility and community" is being destroyed by a 
"mindless smorgasbord of silliness." 
</P>
<P>
Few who followed the recent redistricting fight would dispute that. 
</P>
<P>
But we are troubled by O'Connor's response to the frustrations. Instead of 
redoubling her efforts, she has decided to absent herself more often. The 
ambitious international travel schedule she announced -- with trips to Japan, 
Mexico, France and New York City by the end of the year -- is likely to 
exacerbate the instability. 
</P>
<P>
If abdication was too strong a word in January, it isn't now. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, stability was what O'Connor originally promised to bring to City 
Hall, which had been plagued by scandals and the felony convictions of former 
Mayor Roger Hedgecock. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor has had trouble providing the leadership to sustain the initial 
stability she brought to the office. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of building coalitions, she turned her attention to the Soviet arts 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
If O'Connor's attentions are concentrated on international goals to the extent 
they were on the arts festival, there will be little time for the 
responsibilities she was elected to carry out. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor deserves credit for her personal diplomacy skills. And if she is able 
to use them to move along the idea of a binational airport, the whole San Diego 
region will benefit. But however meritorious her international agenda is for 
San Diego's economic future, the city needs a full-time mayor.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stocks continued their lackluster performance last week with the uncertainties 
of recession, war, inflation and deflation casting ominous clouds over the 
market, according to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San 
Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego stocks -- which did not participate as the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average soared toward 3,000 this past summer -- are, however, joining an 
overall downward trend with most selling at or near their lows for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of stocks did manage to make good gains during the past week. 
</P>
<P>
The largest percentage gainer of the week was Charthouse Enterprises, up 21%, 
following a favorable forecast that was presented at a meeting of analysts and 
money managers last week in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
PS Group was up $2.25 on Monday on the announcement that Warren Buffett of 
Berkshire Hathaway fame had won permission to increase his affiliate holdings 
in excess of 20%. PS Group's board agreed to modify a stockholder rights 
package that clears the way for the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Molecular Biosystems gained $.50 on Monday as it announced the submission of a 
pre-marketing approval application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for 
Albunex, its ultrasound imaging agent. The submission followed 2 1/2 years of 
testing in the United States, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The week, however, had some major casualties. Intermark, a $2-billion holding 
company with interests in 14 companies, made a new low of $3, down from its 
1990 high of $10.75. Since its recent merger with majority-owned Triton Group 
Ltd., whose shareholders received 1.4 shares of Intermark for each Triton 
share, the stock has dropped from $5 to $3. The stock has now dropped 40% in 
less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
Cubic was down $.75 this past week as it announced the phasing out of 
operations of its communications subsidiary in Oceanside and a layoff of up to 
85 people 
</P>
<P>
Besides Intermark, the only other new low registered was Beeba's Creations at 
$5.

PACIFIC INTERTRADE EXPEDITES EXPORTS; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE WESTLAKE VILLAGE FIRM HELPS AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS SELL EVERYTHING 
FROM TV PICTURE TUBES TO LAWN TRIMMERS ABROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Lees, president of Pacific InterTrade Corp. in Westlake Village, was on 
a plane flying to China recently, when he struck up a conversation with someone 
who hoped to sell packaged health food in China. 
</P>
<P>
Lees told the businessman his trip was a waste of time. "The Chinese are not 
going to waste their precious money on this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to sell raisins to China," Lees said. China's importing tastes 
run more to products that will help it build power plants, rail lines and 
telecommunications systems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lees ought to know, because he has helped manufacturers sell refrigerator 
parts, electronic components and TV picture tubes to the Chinese. He has also 
helped identify and develop business opportunities in about 15 other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Since founding Pacific InterTrade in 1986 with his partner, Maarten Fleurke, 
Lees has helped concerns like Corning Glass sell TV picture tubes in China, 
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber sell tires in Ethiopia and the U.S. subsidiary of 
the Swedish company Electrolux sell lawn trimmers in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Lees and Fleurke have built Pacific InterTrade into a company with an expected 
$25 million in revenues this year, compared to about $1 million during its 
first year of operation. They say the company will post an operating profit 
(not including interest expenses) of about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Their 17 employees, mostly foreign trade specialists, speak a total of 15 
languages and have traveled to more than 100 countries. The Dutch-born Fleurke 
said he easily logs 200,000 miles in air travel each year. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific InterTrade is something like a middleman, and for its expertise in 
identifying customers, wading through bureaucratic mazes and re-gearing 
products to suit foreign tastes, the company earns both flat fees and 
commissions of as much as 10% of gross sales. 
</P>
<P>
The company also lines up foreign buyers for American goods, purchases the 
products with borrowed money and resells them at a markup. It doesn't hold any 
inventory, however, since it arranges for the buyer to receive the shipment 
directly from the manufacturer or distributor. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,500 to 2,000 companies in the United States that, like 
Pacific InterTrade, act as intermediaries in international trade, according to 
the Commerce Department. Although a few are owned by large banks or 
corporations, most are independent operations that specialize in one or two 
industries or countries and have fewer than six employees. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for these intermediaries is growing, said Stanley Epstein, president of 
American Export Trading Co. in North Hollywood, because of increasing pressure 
on American companies to sell their products abroad. But foreign trade can be 
"complex to the point of being intimidating" for manufacturers, he said, so 
they often turn to specialists like Pacific InterTrade to help smooth the way. 
</P>
<P>
Lees cites Pacific InterTrade's cracking of the Japanese consumer products 
market for the Paramount division of WCI, the U.S. subsidiary of the Swedish 
concern Electrolux, as one of its success stories. Pacific InterTrade found 
that the Japanese were hungry for the kind of lawn trimmers and blowers that 
Paramount makes. It helped set up distribution, translated all the marketing 
materials and even convinced Paramount to shorten the handles by a few inches 
to make them a better fit for the smaller-statured Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good market for American consumer goods," said Pradeep Roy, Paramount's 
director of international sales. Thanks to Pacific InterTrade, Roy said, the 
Japanese market now accounts for "a significant portion of our international 
sales." 
</P>
<P>
Just last year, however, Pacific InterTrade narrowly escaped disaster. It had 
focused almost exclusively on trade in China, which had thrown its doors wide 
open to foreign goods. But several months before the Tian An Men Square 
massacre last year, Lees noticed the doors beginning to close as the Chinese 
government began curbing imports to try to stall growing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Products like the TV tubes and other electronic components that Pacific 
InterTrade helped import to China, as well as machinery and parts used for 
refrigerators and videocassette recorders, suddenly were subject to a more 
lengthy and stringent permitting process. And in order to get the permits at 
all, importers had to prove the products would be used to make finished 
products that China could export. 
</P>
<P>
Within a matter of months, Pacific InterTrade's roughly $20 million in annual 
business in China was cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacific InterTrade turned its sights on other countries, such as the Soviet 
Union, Japan, Poland and Brazil, to make up for the slowdown in China. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Pacific InterTrade set up a deal with Poland in which it earned 
fees on the same goods coming and going out of the country. Corning Glass, 
which had shut down its Brazilian TV tube-making plant, and a small Ohio 
company, agreed to sell equipment and parts with the purchases backed by 
letters of credit from Poland's central bank. Poland assembled the glass TV 
tubes, and Pacific InterTrade turned around and sold the tubes in several other 
countries, splitting the profits with the Polish government. 
</P>
<P>
These "counter-trades" are increasingly common in international trade, because 
many countries don't want to spend hard currency. But these deals can also be 
logistic nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Fleurke has been trying to sell American-made computer monitor 
parts to the Soviet Union. Because Soviet rubles aren't convertible, and 
dollars are scarce, the plan calls for the Soviets to assemble the parts, then 
Pacific InterTrade will take the finished monitors and sell them in China -- 
which has again begun to loosen its importing requirements -- and split the 
profits with the Soviets. The deal has been ready to go for some time, Fleurke 
said, but he's still waiting for approval from the three Soviet ministries that 
must give the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be patient . . . and have the right connections at the various 
levels in the foreign trade office or in a ministry, or things won't move 
along," Fleurke said. 
</P>
<P>
But even knowing the right contacts doesn't remove all the risk. Fleurke cited 
the example of a large U.S. concern that contracted to sell color television 
technology to a Lithuanian company, and obtained the necessary financial 
guarantees from the central bank in Moscow. But that was before Lithuania 
announced its independence from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Now the central bank says it will no longer guarantee the purchases made by the 
Lithuanian company. In a lucky twist for the Americans, the Soviets have 
decided to buy the technology anyway for a factory in the Russian republic. 
</P>
<P>
Lees said reducing the risk of international trade also means being picky: 
Pacific InterTrade turns down nine out of 10 proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had requests from people who wanted to buy and sell to China full-sized, 
double-door GE refrigerators with lighted water dispensers and ice makers," he 
said. It's another example of misunderstanding the Chinese market, he said, 
because most Chinese citizens can't afford deluxe refrigerators. "Those kind of 
things we don't touch." 
</P>
<P>
Lees, 41, is a former Corning Glass international marketing executive who was 
recruited by Security Pacific after a federal law was passed in 1983 
encouraging banks to set up international trading units. But like many other 
banks that had rushed into the business after the law was passed, Security 
Pacific never made any money on the venture and shut down the trading 
operations in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Lees blamed the losses partly on the emphasis on large projects such as 
geothermal plants, which take several years to build and produce a return on 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he and Fleurke, 35, also a former Security Pacific trading 
executive, decided they could make the concept work and, with about $50,000 of 
their own money, took over the business and started Pacific InterTrade. A third 
partner, Los Angeles attorney Tim C. Bruinsma, maintains his law practice and 
works part time with Pacific InterTrade. The company still has close ties to 
Security Pacific, which oftens provides referrals. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pacific InterTrade is managing to grow at a steady clip, Lees admitted 
that the company still lacks enough cash to buy equity stakes in some of the 
ventures Pacific InterTrade helps set up, hire experts in real estate and other 
specialties, form alliances with fund companies that invest in foreign 
countries and help finance small businesses' foreign ventures. 
</P>
<P>
To expand in those areas, Lees said, Pacific InterTrade will probably have to 
take in a deep-pocketed partner, such as a bank, financial services company, or 
venture capital firm. But Lees said he's in no hurry and would take his time 
making the right deal. "We'd look real hard and long at any potential partner," 
he said.

HPB SEEKS ROLE IN RESTRUCTURING OF NU-MED INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HPB Associates LP, a New York investor group that owns 9.9% of struggling 
Nu-Med Inc., said it is seeking seats on Nu-Med's board of directors to have a 
greater say in the restructuring of the Encino-based health-care management 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
HPB, led by investor Howard P. Berkowitz, also said in a filing last week with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission that its plan is supported by another 
major shareholder, Allen Holding Inc., an affiliate of the wealthy New York 
investment firm Allen &amp; Co., which owns an additional 9.5% of Nu-Med. 
</P>
<P>
HPB said it wants an unspecified number of its designees added to Nu-Med's 
13-member board. They would participate in any restructuring steps, "which 
would increase the value of the company and the stockholders' interest," it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure sparked a moderate rally in the shares of Nu-Med, which operates 
six acute-care hospitals and six psychiatric-care facilities in seven states. 
The stock, which stood at $2.69 a share Sept. 7, closed Monday at $3.50 a share 
in over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Berkowitz's investment has a paper loss of about $3 million, which 
is presumably why he wants to help reorganize Nu-Med. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth E. Rappoport, Nu-Med's vice chairman, said Berkowitz visited with 
Nu-Med management two weeks ago, but Rappoport cautioned that talks concerning 
HPB's proposal "have just really begun." 
</P>
<P>
However, Rappoport said there "was no indication from him of threatening to 
take control" of Nu-Med. "As a significant shareholder, he would like to have 
representation on the board, and he certainly is entitled to some 
representation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nu-Med, struggling with excessive costs, too many empty beds and burdensome 
debts in recent years, has been trying to stem its losses. After losing $7.3 
million on revenue of $278 million in its fiscal year that ended April 30, 
Nu-Med announced Monday that it had a $958,000 profit on revenue of $66.3 
million in its fiscal first quarter that ended July 31. A year earlier, it 
earned $1.04 million on revenue of $73.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Nu-Med sold one of its acute-care hospitals in Florida to Humana Inc. 
for $68 million, which it used to help repay its debt. But another proposal to 
sell three additional hospitals and other assets to a separate group fell 
through. 
</P>
<P>
It was last October when Berkowitz bought 298,000 Nu-Med shares -- to reach his 
9.9% holding -- for between $6.28 and $7.18 a share, according to his SEC 
filing at the time. The filing also showed that he had invested $5.8 million in 
the company. His stake has a current market value of $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz's office said he was on vacation last week and not available to 
elaborate on his group's filing. James Quinn, chief financial officer of Allen 
&amp; Co., said Allen does not comment on its investments.

Ed Malik has big plans. An entrepreneur who's already selling computers to the 
Soviet Union through his Camarillo company Americomp USA, Malik is now close to 
buying a tiny Arizona bank for $3 million. Why? So he can open a branch office 
in Moscow that could help expand his Soviet trade, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But along with his expansion plans, Malik has some legal problems to deal with. 
Two U.S. companies have filed suits this summer in Superior Court in Los 
Angeles and Ventura, alleging that Malik owes them a total of more than $1 
million and refuses to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Global Trading Co., a division of Imperial Bank in Los Angeles, is 
suing him for fraud and breach of contract and is seeking $1 million. That's 
the amount Imperial Global claims Malik owes it for arranging a computer sale 
to the Soviets in December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Malik also is being sued by Craftsman Electronics Inc., an Atlanta company that 
made Soviet-bound computers for him in both the Imperial deal and a separate 
transaction this past March. Craftsman claims Malik owes it $165,000. 
</P>
<P>
Malik not only denies any wrongdoing in both cases, he has countersued 
Craftsman in Ventura and is seeking $7 million in damages. His lawyer, Jacob J. 
Stettin, said he has not yet filed a formal response to Imperial Global's suit. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Malik blames the Imperial Global dispute on Imperial Global, 
contending that it did not live up to the terms of their contract and cost 
Malik an additional $12.6-million contract with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Malik's Americomp is part of Perestroika USA, a company that the India-born 
Malik co-founded in 1985. Malik plans to assemble 16,500 personal computers in 
Camarillo for sale to the Soviet Union under two new contracts valued at a 
combined $45 million, he said last month in a Times story. 
</P>
<P>
Malik said he had been selling various goods in the Soviet Union for several 
years, as Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika economic reforms 
took hold. He said he set up his own manufacturing plant in Camarillo because 
he was unhappy with the quality of computers he was buying from the Far East 
for shipment to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Now Malik wants to get into banking. He has signed a letter of intent to 
purchase Republic National Bank in Phoenix, a small, single-office bank with 
$28 million in assets, Republic President Thomas J. Euen confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
He said Malik approached the bank a month ago, and the parties are negotiating 
a definitive takeover agreement. The bank is privately held, but the research 
firm Sheshunoff &amp; Co. in Austin, Tex., said Republic National lost $1.5 
million in 1989 before earning a $79,000 profit in this year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
According to Imperial's suit, in late 1989 Malik agreed to arrange the sale of 
525 computers to a Soviet agency for $1.4 million. To pay for the machines, 
Malik got a letter of credit -- a type of payment guarantee -- from a Soviet 
bank and took it to Imperial, which agreed to buy the computers on his behalf 
and ship them to the Soviet Union. Imperial was to be repaid by the Soviet bank 
that issued the letter of credit, the suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial said that on Malik's instructions, it bought the first 200 computers 
from Craftsman and shipped them. (Craftsman is not a big name in computers; it 
buys components from other manufacturers and assembles them into finished 
computers.) Imperial said the Soviets were supposed to pay Imperial $320,000 
for those machines, but Malik "got paid instead of us," said Anthony Shen, 
Imperial Global's president. 
</P>
<P>
Shen said he expected Malik to forward the cash. "Instead, he refused to give 
us the money," Shen said. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial, meanwhile, had bought the other 325 computers from Craftsman but 
refused to ship them until it got paid for the first shipment, Shen said. But 
it never got paid in either case, so now Imperial is trying to sell the 
remaining computers elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Malik said that Imperial, by failing to ship all 525 computers within time 
limits, invalidated the letter of credit, and that Imperial is "not entitled to 
the money." He said the Craftsman computers were "junk" and most failed to 
work. That prompted the Soviets to cancel the $12.6-million contract, he said. 
"Imperial is totally responsible for us losing that contract," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shen said Imperial "bought the computers as he ordered. We don't guarantee if 
they work or not." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Tzavaras, Craftsman chief operating officer, defended his company's 
computers and said it tried to send technicians to Moscow to look at the 
machines. Tzavaras said Craftsman needed an invitation from Malik to get into 
the country, but Malik did not provide one. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial's suit also alleged that Malik hyped his personal background when he 
approached Imperial about doing business. (The suit listed Malik's full name as 
Akhter Malik Mokhamed.) The financial statement that he gave Imperial 
"significantly overstated" Malik's credentials, net worth and credit 
worthiness, the suit alleged without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a rush we did not check it out," Shen said. But he said Malik's 
financial situation mattered little. What counted was the letter of credit he 
had from the Soviet bank, and on that basis Imperial accepted the deal, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some facts Malik gave in interviews with The Times also proved slippery. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Malik said he had a doctorate in physics from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- a claim he also made to Imperial -- 
but MIT has no record of him attending. Told of this, Malik later elaborated to 
say his degree was from the University of Bombay in India "under the auspices" 
of MIT, but that could not be immediately confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
He also told The Times that he had countersued Imperial and was seeking $27 
million in damages. But later Malik's lawyer, Stettin, said no such action had 
been taken. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the courts, Malik is waiting to see if regulators give him the green 
light to buy the Phoenix bank. A Moscow office would "facilitate our Soviet 
customers and trading customers" by offering letters of credit and other 
financing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chase Manhattan Bank, the giant New York City bank, is one of the few U.S. 
banks that has an office in Moscow. Such Moscow branches provide mainly trade 
financing. Peter Bakstansky, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York, said U.S. banks are free to try to set up shop there, but it's still not 
easy to get Moscow's approval despite perestroika.

LAKE SUFFERS AS SAGGING ECONOMY SLOWS FISHING; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY FACILITY ALSO FACES FEWER TROUT SUPPLIED BY 
THE STATE, WHICH COULD FURTHER CURB ACTIVITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hugh Marx doesn't need to analyze San Diego County's declining tourism numbers 
to see that something fishy is going on in the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
As general manager of the Lake Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District in the 
east part of the county, Marx is a man who is used to viewing the economy in 
terms of bait sales, boat rentals and lake user fees, all of which he says are 
way down this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, when times are good, fishermen will come in, and they'll buy night 
crawlers, Power Bait, Zeke's floating cheese and salmon eggs, all at once. Now 
. . . they're buying Power Bait or night crawlers one bait at a time," Marx 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he can see that fishermen "are really watching their money a lot 
more closely. We're just not getting people spending the money like they used 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Declining business is not Marx's only problem. In August, the California 
Department of Fish and Game announced that it will cut back the number of trout 
it plants each year in Lake Cuyamaca and at other Southern California fishing 
areas. Fewer trout could mean even less business. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the state planted 20,000 pounds of trout in the lake, which is just 
off California 79 about 40 miles east of San Diego. Budget cutbacks in the 
state hatchery program will mean that the number will be cut to 15,000 pounds 
in 1990. Next year, the state allotment will be cut even further, to 10,000 
pounds, Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Taucher, a regional spokesman for Fish and Game, said the reduction in 
Cuyamaca's allotment was part of a $10-million, legislatively imposed budget 
cutback that specifically called for closing of the Mojave River hatchery in 
San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Taucher said it could have been worse for Lake Cuyamaca. A number of other 
Southern California fishing areas, including four in San Diego County, will 
receive no state-planted trout at all once the Mojave River hatchery closes in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Those fishing areas that were not eliminated from the trout planting program, 
including Lake Cuyamaca, will be supplied by the smaller Fillmore Hatchery in 
Ventura County, Taucher said. 
</P>
<P>
Pending budget restoration legislation does not include funds to rescue the 
Mojave River hatchery, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Marx said directors of the Lake Cuyamaca district will have no choice but to 
replace the state-supplied trout with fish from a private source if they want 
the lake to maintain its reputation as one of the best fishing spots in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
At $2 a pound, replacing the entire state trout allotment will cost $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think my board will stock less fish," Marx said. Fishermen "are of the 
opinion that they can't catch fish unless the lake has been stocked within the 
last two weeks. . . . If you'd let them, they'd stand out there with a net 
behind the truck and catch the fish." 
</P>
<P>
Replacing the state fish with privately planted ones will not solve all of 
Marx's problems, however. 
</P>
<P>
Trout supplied by Cuyamaca's private planter, the White Water Hatchery, weigh 
more than the trout provided by the state. So, even though Cuyamaca will have 
the same amount of fish in pounds, there will actually be fewer in the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"When mom or dad bring the kids out to catch fish, they don't care if it's that 
big or that big," Marx said, holding his hands out to indicate different sizes. 
"All they want to do is catch fish." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the prospect of fewer fish for families to catch does not excite 
Marx, who said he is already concerned about anglers' declining interest in 
Lake Cuyamaca. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm seeing a decrease in our regular angler -- anglers who last year we would 
see once a week," Marx said. "Now we see them on the average of once a month." 
</P>
<P>
The Lake Cuyamaca district was established in 1962 by the state to provide a 
year-round recreational lake for San Diego County. The lake is leased for this 
purpose from the Helix Water District. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Cuyamaca district is a public agency, Marx said, he and the 
lake's directors try to run it like a business. The lake's operations are 
generally self-sufficient and are not subsidized with tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made a profit almost every year, and anything we make gets turned 
immediately back into the district," Marx added. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, Marx said he is not sure that the district will be 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm already losing money this year," he said. The number of adult fishermen 
who come to his park is down by about one-third this summer -- from 12,059 for 
the May through July period in 1989 to 8,042 for the same period this year. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of our normal business, we're off by almost 50% this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marx said he can already see the declining numbers of fishermen translating 
into lower revenues from boat rentals, launching and lake user fees, tackle 
shop sales and commissions on the sale of state fishing licenses. 
</P>
<P>
During July, the district's net revenues were down 63.5%, from $26,000 in 1989 
to $9,500 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In May, June and July, the district earned a combined $14,254, down nearly 72% 
from the $50,445 earned in the same three months last year. 
</P>
<P>
Marx said he expected August's figures to be in line with those of the last few 
months. "Usually, I make enough in June, July and August to carry me through 
the rest of the year. That's not the case this year." 
</P>
<P>
Declining attendance and revenue will make it difficult for the district to 
come up with the funds it will need to purchase the 10,000 pounds of 
state-planted trout it is losing. 
</P>
<P>
"We will probably cut back in other areas, most likely staff," Marx said. The 
district employs 16 people. The district's board of directors does not want to 
raise prices "with the economy down," he added. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, a one-day lake user fee at Cuyamaca is $4 for an adult and $2 
for a child. Children 8 and younger fish free when accompanied by an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Full-day boat rentals are $8 or $17, depending on the type of boat. Half-day 
rates range from $6 to $13. 
</P>
<P>
Marx also sells state fishing licenses, which cost $6.75 for the day or $21 for 
the year. The district receives a 50-cent commission for every license sold. 
</P>
<P>
The drought has not helped matters either, Marx said. "We are down three feet 
from where we would be ordinarily this time of year, but the lake still has a 
lot of fishable water. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think about it," because the lake is smaller and the district will 
still plant the same amount of fish, "it should be easier" to catch the fish, 
Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
Marx also attributed some of the decline in business to a weed problem caused 
by the lower water levels and uncomfortably high temperatures earlier in the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The fish love the weeds but the fishermen don't," he said. "If a fisherman 
casts out and brings in a big chunk of salad, it just ruins his day." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Marx said he became convinced that a general weakening of the 
economy was the real reason for the slowdown when his business did not pick 
back up after the weed problem was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess right now is that, until the economy turns around, business is going 
to be slow for everybody," Marx said. "Some recreation stands up better under 
slow times than others. But it doesn't seem like this lake is experiencing 
that."

Brief Ruling: Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia made light of the heavy 
legal writing that lawyers often submit to courts. Legal briefs are "a subject 
full of paradoxes, not the least of which is the name brief . . . . These 
things are 50 pages long," he said at a lawyers' meeting in Snowmass Village, 
Colo., over the weekend. The word has its origin in the "ancient Saxon word 
braf," and another word -- made with the same letters arranged slightly 
differently -- "that means, roughly translated, to go on and on at great length 
until it makes you sick."

Different Message: Steve Gobie, whose relationship with Rep. Barney Frank led 
to a reprimand for Frank by the full House, has been on Capitol Hill again. 
This time he showed up as a messenger for a local delivery service. He was

congressional offices without being readily recognized.

Change of Course: It's not easy playing second fiddle to the nation's second

married. I was never going to have children," she said Saturday. She married 
Quayle 10 weeks after they met. She spoke in Grand Rapids, Mich., to the 
Michigan Bar Assn. while her husband played golf at a Republican fund-raiser.

Old News: Former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite is writing his memoirs at last, 
after signing a contract for his autobiography 20 years ago. Cronkite, 73, who 
signed with Alfred A. Knopf, said the book won't be a tell-all about CBS News. 
"There have been enough books about all that," he said. And the title? "I'm 
going to have to fight the publishers to keep them from calling it 'And That's 
the Way It Is.' "

JACK SMITH: BARBARIC? UNCIVILIZED? ADMITTEDLY, THE DEFENSE IS FEEBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"My husband and I have enjoyed your column for many years," writes Polly S. 
Browder of La Jolla. "We are about your age, have two married children, two 
careers and relate to much of what you write about." 
</P>
<P>
Much as I like such sentiments, I have learned not to trust them. Too often 
they are merely a lure. An ambush follows. Indeed, Mrs. Browder springs her 
trap in the next sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"But today you lost us. We have always thought of you and your wife as very 
civilized people. But people who watch television while they dine (I use the 
word loosely) are not civilized. People who have their dining room table piled 
high with junk are not civilized. People who subsist on frozen microwave 
dinners are not civilized. People who never have their friends over for dinner 
are not civilized." 
</P>
<P>
In one paragraph Mrs. Browder has reduced me and my wife to Neanderthals. If 
the delinquencies she enumerates are truly the mark of barbarians, then indeed 
we are barbarians. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Browder's indictment is based on my own revelations, so I cannot accuse 
her of inventing evidence. I have admitted all the faults she accuses us of. 
</P>
<P>
To an alarming degree, I think she is right. We generally eat dinner about 8 
o'clock, sitting down at our TV trays just as the 8 o'clock sex-and-violence 
movie begins. That kills two hours. Of course, we sometimes converse during 
commercials, usually complaining that we don't understand the plot. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials do deaden the spirit. We see the same ones over and over again, 
advertising cars, scents, cereals, soaps, deodorants, telephone services, beer 
and sauces. Most of them are egregiously cute. I can't believe that this 
avalanche of repetitious schlock really sells anything. 
</P>
<P>
So, in that sense, we are uncivilized. Like most of our contemporaries, we fill 
our heads with advertising, rather than with the treasures of our literature. 
It is hard to believe that in the early days of our marriage we read to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
It is true also that we dine mostly on microwave dinners. That is especially 
ironic when you consider that my wife has perhaps 1,000 cookbooks. But 
microwave dinners are easy to prepare when she comes home late from work, as 
she usually does, and she has no choice if she is to have dinner on the trays 
before the movie starts. 
</P>
<P>
I am not responsible for the dining room table's condition. That is my wife's 
work. She is buried under so much paper work that she has no choice. She has 
the naive notion that when our remodeling is finished, the desk in her new work 
room will be large enough to contain all her documents, magazines, catalogues, 
bills and correspondence. It will not. It will be too small and too far removed 
from the living room and kitchen -- the center of whatever activity there is. 
By location and size, the dining room table is ideally suited to its present 
function. 
</P>
<P>
Here we have a conflict. Paying bills, figuring out one's income tax, answering 
correspondence, reconciling one's bank statement and ordering merchandise from 
catalogues is a part of being civilized. Perhaps the civilized man is more 
identified by his paper work than by his dining habits. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that we haven't had a dinner party -- except for our immediate 
families -- for years. My wife comes home too late to prepare a dinner on 
weekdays, and on weekends we need the privacy and the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"At first," says Mrs. Browder, "I thought you were writing a parody on the 
mindless generation whose lives are programmed by remote control. But then I 
realized you were serious. . . . Do you really enjoy the 'vast wasteland' of 
sex and violence and connubial silence? If so, it is fortunate that your 
children left in time." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, our two sons grew up watching "Gunsmoke" and "Have Gun -- Will 
Travel," from which they learned their moral values, in lieu of religious 
training. Both of them are sober, responsible and law-abiding men. 
</P>
<P>
I doubt, however, that any such values can be inculcated by today's situation 
comedies, which seem to me to be vulgar slapstick at its worst. That's why my 
wife and I concentrate on the relatively literate and moral substance of 
sex-and-violence movies. At least the characters are involved in adult 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
We do have season tickets for the Philharmonic, the Mark Taper and the Theater 
Center; surely going to concerts and the theater marks a man as civilized, 
though it is surprising how many of the plays we see are concerned with sex and 
violence. It seems to be a fact of our culture. 
</P>
<P>
I'm afraid I haven't made a very good case for my wife and me. Perhaps, as Mrs. 
Browder alleges, we are uncivilized. On the other hand, considering the nature 
of modern man -- greedy, intolerant, belligerent, selfish -- one can be 
civilized without being good. 
</P>
<P>
One of these evenings I'm going to ask my wife to prepare a home-cooked dinner 
and serve it on the dining room table, and we'll talk this whole thing over.

CS&amp;N TAKES ITS DEJA VU CREDO TOO FAR; 
</P>
<P>
ICONS OF THE '60S HAVE SOME GOOD MOMENTS AT IRVINE MEADOWS, BUT THEIR MUSICAL 
PAST HAUNTS THEM, PERHAPS LIMITING THEIR TALENTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
"We have all been here before. . . . We have all been here before." That 
refrain from Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash's "Deja Vu" pretty much set the tone of 
their 2 1/2-hour show at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on Sunday. While highly 
musical and, at times, even lively, their performance also showed why the '60s 
icons are an ideal sponsor band for VH-1, the retro-video network whose current 
motto is "For when you've seen it all." 
</P>
<P>
Though they waited until the second half of the show before plunging into the 
hallowed harmonies of their 1969 debut album, "Crosby, Stills and Nash," a smug 
stasis overhung much of the proceedings. Several of their contemporaries -- 
with one notable example being old crony Neil Young -- continue to make music 
that challenges and prods, and properly regards art as a lifelong odyssey. But 
CS&amp;N seems more akin to self-satisfied lotus eaters who have given up the 
quest. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, they do some fine grazing. Sunday, their time-worn voices harmonized 
far better than they did in concert in their glory days (check out the old 
CS&amp;N live bootlegs for some really off-key action). And with a fine 
back-line band pumped by longtime drummer Joe Vitale and David Lindley's former 
bassist Jorge Calderon, the music really kicked in places. 
</P>
<P>
One well-placed kick was the opening number, Stephen Stills' "Love the One 
You're With," which set a lively groove that sadly wasn't matched by all that 
followed it. "Wooden Ships," often a creaky item in past shows, also flew, with 
keyboardist Mike Finnigan and guitarist Stills exchanging terse instrumental 
lines. The finest harmony work came on an arrangement of "My Country 'Tis of 
Thee." 
</P>
<P>
The trio offered five songs from the current "Live It Up" album, but only one 
actually displayed much life. That was "Yours and Mine," a moving missive about 
how children are raised to participate in a violent world. 
</P>
<P>
They offered their handful of '70s and '80s successes, including "Just a Song 
Before I Go," "Wasted on the Way," "Southern Cross" and "Got It Made," along 
with several selections form their respective solo careers. Among those were 
David Crosby's recent "Drive My Car," Stills' "Change Partners" and Graham 
Nash's "Cathedral" and "Please Come to Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
That song's heady refrain of "We can change the world" seemed sadly at odds 
with the complacency -- admittedly a lovely, well-honed complacency -- of much 
of the performance. Perhaps, given just how the world has changed in the last 
20 years, it's harder to find the spirit to sing such songs. 
</P>
<P>
While the trio and its band did put a surprising enthusiasm into the obligatory 
"Wooden Ships" and "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes," some of the "classics" that 
dominated the show's second half -- such as the encore of the insufferable 
"Teach Your Children" -- had the air of a liturgy that has been repeated into 
meaninglessness. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Beach Boys and far too many other performers that the VH-1 generation 
clings to, CS&amp;N has become an institution, resistant to change or risk. And 
network slogans or no, as their frighteningly vital pal Young continually 
demonstrates in his work, just because we may have been alive in the legendary 
'60s, we haven't yet "seen it all" by a long shot.

The Green Stuff: Bill Cosby has recouped his ranking as the entertainment 
world's top earner from singer Michael Jackson, Forbes magazine reports. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes issued its list of the world's highest-paid entertainers, headed by an 
estimated $115 million in earnings by Cosby in 1989 and 1990. Jackson had 
earnings of about $100 million in that period. The Rolling Stones rock group 
rose from eighth place two years ago to third place on the 1990 list, taking in 
$88 million. The cream of the Forbes "Top 40" richest entertainers were: Steven 
Spielberg, $87 million; New Kids on the Block, $78 million; Oprah Winfrey, $68 
million; Sylvester Stallone, $63 million; and Madonna, $62 million. BETH KLEID

'FUNNIEST PEOPLE': HAMMY AMATEURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oh, your aching sides. Just how much wit can viewers stand in one evening? 
</P>
<P>
From the womb of "America's Funniest Home Videos" comes "America's Funniest 
People," which premiered on ABC at 8:30 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
If you can play the musical saw while standing on your head and wiggling your 
ears, this may be your ticket to the big time. 
</P>
<P>
Like its parent, which became one of the surprise hits of last season, the new 
series gives cash prizes for home videos. Unlike the older series, the new one 
has two babbling hosts, David Coulier and Arleen Sorkin. And again unlike the 
older series, this one is happy to have the videos staged, with people cutting 
up in front of a camera. 
</P>
<P>
When "America's Funniest Home Videos" works, it's because of spontaneity, a 
quality lacking in its offspring. "America's Funniest People" travels the 
country in search of hammy amateurs. The search has already yielded a man who 
on Sunday was shown balancing a bike on his face and another who balanced a 
chair on his face. And it got even better. There was a ventriloquist who was 
named one of the week's finalists for material like this: 
</P>
<P>
Man: My sister's got beautiful eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Dummy: All three of them. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, these two have a good shot at replacing the hosts.HOWARD

'MARRIED PEOPLE': THE 30-MINUTE ITCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like some marriages, the premiere of ABC's comedy series "Married People" (9:30 
tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42) starts promisingly. 
</P>
<P>
"White folks are movin' in, always a bad sign," Olivia (Barbara Montgomery) 
remarks to her husband, Nick (Ray Aranha), about the gentrification of their 
working-class Harlem neighborhood, which has turned the brownstone they own 
into a trendy apartment that they now share with two upper-middle-class white 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
Nick: What white folks wanna live in Harlem for anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Olivia: Some real estate genius called it Central Park North and they bought 
it. 
</P>
<P>
One of the couples who "bought it" and now reside above Olivia and Nick on the 
second floor are Elizabeth (Bess Armstrong), a pregnant attorney who vows that 
her new condition will not change her career or life style, and her husband, 
Russell (Jay Thomas), a stay-at-home free-lance writer who is starting to feel 
old at 36. In the attic apartment are snuggling, smooching newlyweds Allen 
(Chris Young) and Cindy (Megan Gallivan). Three couples in different stages of 
wedlock share a house and their matrimonial joys and problems. It's a nice 
premise. 
</P>
<P>
Again like some marriages, however, "Married People" ultimately settles into a 
rut, a sort of middle-range monotone buzz. It's not exactly stupefying, but the 
lows far outnumber the modest highs and the thrill is definitely gone. 
</P>
<P>
Although the gruff-but-golden Nick gets most of the one-liners, the most 
appealing element of "Married People" is the matriarchal benevolence of Olivia, 
who wears well. The least appealing is the drowning dewiness of the newlyweds. 
Cindy is especially grating. Meanwhile, Elizabeth and Russell are in between: 
nice but, well . . . anyway. 
</P>
<P>
You can see "Married People" as an occasional fling, but a meaningful long-term 
relationship seems out of the question. HOWARD ROSENBERG

L.A. AND OTHER CITIES SOFTEN CENSUS UNDERCOUNT CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE C. ROARK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After complaining that preliminary 1990 census figures grossly underestimated 
the growth of their populations over the past decade, officials in many big 
cities -- including Los Angeles -- say that census counts may not be quite as 
far off as the critics originally alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, officials in Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and other 
metropolitan areas continue to say that there were serious errors in the Census 
Bureau's population count, which could cost local governments seats in Congress 
and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
In an official challenge forwarded to Washington late Monday, Los Angeles 
officials said they had turned up 49,513 more dwellings than the 1.3 million 
units counted by the Census Bureau. While that difference of 3.8% could 
translate into thousands of people and millions of dollars in government aid, 
the figure is well below the 10% housing underestimate Los Angeles officials 
had originally predicted. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, the Census Bureau has put the city's 1990 population at 3.42 
million -- 15% above the 1980 level. But the challenge over housing units, when 
translated into residents, could bring that figure up by 123,783 -- a total 
about equal to the population of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of missing anyone who resides in the Los Angeles area can have 
a devastating impact on the federal funds we may receive to provide needed city 
services," Mayor Tom Bradley said from Frankfurt, West Germany, while on a 
mission to promote tourism. 
</P>
<P>
During the remainder of this week, cities and towns across the country will be 
scurrying to complete formal responses to the initial census figures. 
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last week, the Census Bureau had received formal responses 
from 4,341, or 11%, of all local governments, but not all have formally 
challenged the census numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've actually received a lot of letters here accepting our counts, telling us 
we were right in the ball park," said Denise Smith, an official in the Census 
Bureau's regional office that covers all of New England and Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
In Houston, a week before the deadline, officials were finding the local review 
of housing units much closer to the census count than they had expected. 
Nonetheless, city officials were challenging the Census Bureau's contention 
that Houston has 1.61 million residents and essentially has not grown since 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, officials were disturbed but not surprised by the census 
conclusion that population has eroded over the past decade, with city dwellers 
fleeing in ever-larger numbers to the suburbs. While officials there thought 
the census count was off, they also acknowledged that their numbers were not as 
different as they had thought. Based on earlier estimates, city officials said 
the census had overlooked as many as 97,000 dwellings. In fact, the post-census 
review of building permits and other records showed that the census undercount 
was closer to 67,000 units, said Barbara J. Kaplan, executive director of the 
city Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In a few places, officials continued to say the numbers would be as bad -- and 
in some cases, worse -- than anticipated. In Chicago, a week before the 
deadline, the difference between the census count and the local review was 
"large and growing larger," said Susan Weed, a community development 
demographer. 
</P>
<P>
New York's deadline is also later this week, but officials there continued to 
be outspoken in their criticism of the preliminary census count of 600,000 
fewer residents than the city had a decade ago -- a situation that officials 
say is preposterous, given their large homeless population and the city's 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in Washington last week, Barbara Everitt Bryant, the director of 
the Census Bureau, responded sharply to the New York officials in her first 
public statement since the agency released the preliminary 1990 counts last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
If New York's population did not drop, she said at the hearing, "Why did the 
school enrollment drop by 54,000? Why do the moving vans show more people going 
out than coming in?" 
</P>
<P>
The bureau has until mid-October to assess the challenges, at which time it 
will begin preparing a final gross count of the population, due on the 
President's desk by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
While these operations and last-minute efforts are under way to correct the 
preliminary census count of 245.8 million, census statisticians will be 
evaluating what is known as the post-enumeration survey, a statistical survey 
analyzing how well the regular census did in finding such hard-to-count 
residents as immigrants and inner-city residents. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, New York and other cities and states, along with civic and civil 
rights groups, filed a lawsuit after the 1980 census seeking to force a 
statistical correction of the 1990 census based on this study. Although the 
lawsuit is pending, the commerce department did agree to conduct the study to 
make an adjustment possible, if the Secretary of Commerce decides it is 
necessary.

SPORTS STARS SAY THEY WERE BILKED BY PASADENA SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: THE 'BASEBALL LEGENDS' PROMOTER, WHO SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED, 
IS SOUGHT BY POLICE. 
</P>

<P>
A major sports memorabilia show's organizer was under investigation by Pasadena 
policeMonday as more than a dozen sports stars, including Mickey Mantle, Don 
Drysdale and Ernie Banks, complained that they were bilked of tens of thousands 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen businesses involved with the three-day "Baseball Legends" show at 
the Pasadena Center Sept. 7-9 also have told The Times they were owed thousands 
of dollars more for their services. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena police officials confirmed that they have opened an investigation into 
the matter and want to talk with the show's principal promoter, Ernest Dent. 
</P>
<P>
The police investigation began late last week after former New York Yankee star 
Mantle reported that a check he received for $16,000 had bounced, Detective 
Mark Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
The show, believed to be the largest of its kind in Southern California, 
attracted at least 10,000 sports fans and possibly thousands more. About 30 
sports and television celebrities were in attendance to sign autographs for 
fees estimated to range from $1,000 to $32,000. General admission was $5 and 
the price of autographs ranged from $6 to $30. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the sports figures and businesses associated with the show said that 
they either had not been reimbursed or had been paid with checks that later 
bounced. Some accused the promoters of conducting a well-planned scam. 
</P>
<P>
The event was organized by Dent along with two partners, Rick Abbott and Dee 
Lipscomb, who until recently occupied an office and two apartments in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Repeated efforts to contact Dent, Abbott or Lipscomb by telephone and at their 
residences over the last two days were unsuccessful. Their office on Colorado 
Boulevard in Glendale had a "pay rent or quit" notice on its front door. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately we were not able to escape what appears to be a planned scam by 
Mr. Dent," said Mark Roesler, president of Curtis Management Group in 
Indianapolis. He said he represented eight celebrities who appeared at the 
show, including Little Rascals stars Spanky McFarland and Tom Bond and former 
Rams football stars Tom Fears and Elroy (Crazy Legs) Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Meyers, wife of Don Drysdale, said in an interview Monday that her husband 
also was owed money: "The check they gave Don did bounce, so I went down to the 
bank today and they said the checks were no good the day after the show." 
</P>
<P>
Other stars claiming through representatives to be owed money are former Laker 
Kurt Rambis and former Major League baseball stars Bob Feller, Monte Irvin, 
Davey Lopes and Eddie Mathews. Former boxing champion Joe Frazier was only 
partially paid for his appearance, according to his son, who refused further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials described their interest as a "criminal investigation" and 
said detectives wanted to interview Dent, a 43-year-old said by former 
associates to have come originally from West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson said Dent was "a relative unknown at this type of thing, and all of a 
sudden had a big show. Whether or not what happened was intentional, or whether 
Dent was a bad businessman who got in over his head, we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Harlan J. Werner, who is considered an expert in the memorabilia business but 
was not involved in "Baseball Legends," said he had not heard of Dent before 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Dent went to a couple of card shows and talked to me about the number of 
ballplayers he planned to have at his show, and I told him with that amount of 
ballplayers he could expect to lose $250,000," Werner said. "He (Dent) told me, 
'I have $250,000 to lose.' " 
</P>
<P>
Experts in such events said it was unusual to contract with such a large number 
of celebrities, and they noted that the gate receipts would not begin to cover 
the talent fees. 
</P>
<P>
"Dent came in with a new concept and had incredible advertising. . . . He 
seemed like a real good guy, a character. He could be your best friend." 
</P>
<P>
A Glendale police spokesman said his department also is looking into the matter 
because many of the business owners who claim they are unpaid operate in that 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department is tangentially involved as well: The heavily 
publicized event claimed to be in part a benefit for the department's DARE 
anti-drug program. LAPD officials said, however, that they were not a sponsor 
or designated recipient of proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Trade shows similar to "Baseball Legends" have exploded in popularity in recent 
years and now generate an estimated $400 million annually a year in revenues in 
the United States alone. 
</P>
<P>
The event had all the trappings of a successful affair, according to many of 
the participants. It was promoted with slick brochures and advertisements in 
local newspapers, collectors publications and on cable television. One 
promotion brochure said DARE was a sponsor and would receive a share of the 
proceeds. Some participants said they were impressed by promotional material, 
which included a letter from the mayor of Pasadena proclaiming Sept. 8 "Mickey 
Mantle Day." 
</P>
<P>
By 11 a.m. Saturday, the second day of the show, enough people had crammed the 
convention and conference center that Pasadena fire officials ordered the 
promoters to limit new ticket sales. Some people involved in the show said 
attendance seemed to exceed the 10,000 admission tickets sold at the center box 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"The lines came out the front door, two and three abreast, went down the block 
and around the corner," said Duncan Baird, a Pasadena Fire Department battalion 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
Once the event was over, "We thought everything was fine, that it had been a 
success," said Jess Waiters, Pasadena Center's director of operations. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we started getting phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
Waiters said an initial check from Dent when he reserved the facility early in 
the year had bounced, and after that the promoter was placed on a cash-only 
basis. Center officials then had no problem collecting about $30,000 in total 
fees, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Several local businessmen said that, two days after the show, they went to 
Dent's Glendale office at a designated time to collect payment for thousands of 
dollars worth of office supplies, posters, lithographs, or airline tickets -- 
and found it abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Marin, who claims to be owed $22,700 for thousands of lithographs, 
tickets and posters, said the printing order for the baseball show had been the 
largest her small 5-year-old company, Golden Earth Graphics of Highland Park, 
ever received. She intitially was thrilled, but said sadly: "If we don't get 
those guys, and get my money, I am out of business." 
</P>
<P>
Brian de Van, manager of Caravan Travel in Glendale, said he lost $15,000 
expended for airline tickets ordered by Dent to fly celebrities to the event. 
</P>
<P>
William Mandel, a 30-year-old hobbyist and dealer from Los Angeles, claimed he 
lost an investent of $8,500. 
</P>
<P>
"I signed a contract with Mr. Dent to be a distributer of the posters and 
lithographs to be sold in conjunction with the show and we'd split the 
profits," Mandel said. ". . . I was supposed to get back my initial investment 
at the show plus a very healthy profit. . . . I lost it all." 
</P>
<P>
Marin and others said they trusted Dent and his partners because their initial 
contacts had been postive -- and the promoters at first had paid in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Martinez, co-owner of Nelson's Stationery in Glendale, which claims to have 
nearly $2,000 in uncollected bills, said Dent had a swaggering aura. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave everybody the impression he had money," Martinez said. "He got 
everyone's attention by talking big." 
</P>
<P>
Banks' wife, Marjorie Banks, said she scheduled her husband, the former Chicago 
Cubs star, to attend because Dent "implied that the (DARE) . . . drugs program 
was highly involved, so that's why I didn't go through my normal routine, like 
requiring a cashier's check or payment in advance."

RULING BLOCKING COAL-FIRED PLANT STANDS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE STATE HIGH COURT REJECTS PLEAS OF DOZENS OF OBJECTORS TO THE 
DECISION THAT PREVENTED OPERATION OF THE NEARLY COMPLETED FACILITY IN HANFORD.

<P>
The state Supreme Court, rejecting pleas from dozens of developers, 
municipalities and financial institutions, on Monday let stand a far-reaching 
appellate decision that blocked operation of a nearly completed $70-million 
coal-burning power plant in Hanford. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, in a brief order, refused to hear a challenge to a ruling last 
June by a state Court of Appeal in Fresno that critics said could bring costly 
new delays and uncertainty to building projects throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal court held that the Hanford City Council, in preparing an 
environmental impact report on the project, had failed to adequately consider 
its effect on air quality throughout the region and to fully weigh less harmful 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate ruling sparked a flood of protests from critics who said that 
because the court's environmental requirements were so strict, governmental 
agencies would be forced to investigate even clearly unfeasible alternatives 
and allow belated, time-consuming court challenges to city and county general 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The state high court, by recent count, had received letters from more than 60 
agencies and institutions -- an unusually high number for a court case -- 
joining the project's builder in seeking review of the ruling. The broad range 
of organizations filing letters included the California Chamber of Commerce; 
the University of California Board of Regents; Southern California Edison Co.; 
Los Angeles and San Francisco; Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment banking 
firm; and the Walt Disney Co., the developer of proposed theme parks in Long 
Beach and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The justices' refusal to review the issue makes the appeal court ruling binding 
on trial courts throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for backers of the Hanford project said further efforts would be 
made in the trial court to come up with a plan that will meet environmental 
concerns and allow completion and operation of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher W. Garrett of San Diego, attorney for the builder, expressed 
disappointment and said the appellate ruling would have "an enormous impact on 
the way public agencies grant permits to various residential, commercial and 
industrial projects." 
</P>
<P>
E. Clement Shute Jr., a San Francisco lawyer representing opponents of the 
project, hailed the high court's action as a display of judicial independence. 
"This shows the court realizes the Legislature enacted far-reaching 
environmental statutes and that its job is to interpret them as broadly as it 
can," Shute said. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose over the proposed construction of a coal-fired cogeneration 
plant by GWF Power Systems Inc. to simultaneously provide steam and electricity 
to the Armstrong Tire Co. and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
The tire company was on the verge of closing its plant, with the threatened 
loss of 600 jobs, but agreed to remain open when the cogeneration plant -- a 
less costly source of energy -- was proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Farm and environmental groups strongly opposed the project, saying it would 
significantly increase air pollution, causing further damage to crops, and 
reduce ground water levels. But the city's environmental impact report 
concluded that the project would have no significant adverse effect, and the 
plant was approved. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents brought suit challenging the adequacy of the city's report, but a 
Kings County Superior Court in 1988 rejected their contentions, upholding the 
city's analysis. 
</P>
<P>
But the Court of Appeal, in a 3-0 ruling, held that the city had failed to 
obtain sufficient information to make an informed decision about whether to 
approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal court held that the city had improperly failed to study the 
cumulative effect of the project on air quality along with scores of other 
developments -- including more than 100 other cogeneration plants -- planned in 
the San Joaquin Valley air basin.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
WILSON MAINTAINS EDGE AS BOTH SIDES KEEP UP FAST FUND-RAISING PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush arrives in Los Angeles today to serve as the most visible foot 
soldier in a fund-raising battle between Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein, who 
together expect to raise and spend more than $25 million in their quest for the 
governorship. 
</P>
<P>
With two events -- a dinner tonight in Los Angeles and lunch Wednesday in San 
Francisco -- Bush will probably bring $2 million in contributions to Wilson's 
campaign, the Republican senator's campaign director said. First Lady Barbara 
Bush is expected to raise another $250,000 in the first week of October during 
a two-day trip here. 
</P>
<P>
The fund-raisers, campaign aides say, keep on track Wilson's effort to bring in 
$16 million to $18 million by Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
"From a budget dynamic, we feel we're pretty much on target," said Otto Bos, 
Wilson's campaign director. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's campaign said the Democrat's comparatively modest effort to raise 
$10 million for the general election race is also on target, with more than 
$1.5 million expected in profits from two early October fund-raisers alone. 
</P>
<P>
Since the primary, Feinstein also has succeeded in persuading 2,000 donors to 
become members of her "California Cabinet," a fund-raising club that requires a 
$1,000 contribution for membership. 
</P>
<P>
"We will certainly have enough to be competitive," said Dee Dee Myers, 
Feinstein's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Past experience gives Wilson the edge in fund raising. According to reports 
filed with the secretary of state's office, his campaign has been raising money 
at twice the pace of Feinstein. Last month, the most recent period for which 
records were available, Wilson had $3.9 million in the bank and Feinstein had 
$645,000. Since then, each has launched costly television campaigns, leaving in 
question the amounts they have left. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates are not required to file updated financial statements until Oct. 
5, and they are closely guarding the amount they are taking in and spending 
until then. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of financial pressures in a state where expensive television 
commercials can dictate success, both campaigns have maintained a furious 
money-raising pace. A partial list of Feinstein's Northern California 
fund-raisers has her conducting 20 such events in 13 days, beginning last 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing fund-raising events and phone calls (to solicit donations) every 
single day," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's schedule is similar. For the week that began Wednesday, he has 
scheduled nine fund-raisers, press spokesman Bill Livingstone said. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican's fund-raising muscles have been well exercised in recent years. 
He raised $16 million for his Senate reelection in 1988, and followed that by 
raising $8.2 million in 1989, a non-election year. The latter figure represents 
80% of Feinstein's projected budget for the entire general election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the campaign, Feinstein's aides have made no secret of the 
hand-to-mouth nature of their effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We're spending money," said her campaign director, Bill Carrick. "It's been 
sort of our intention to keep running on empty." 
</P>
<P>
But Feinstein also wants to avoid tumbling into the abyss in which her 
Democratic rival, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, found himself during the 
primary. As the election closed in, Van de Kamp had to suspend several days of 
public campaigning to court donors. As a result, he disappeared from the 
television screens and newspaper columns when he most needed news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The former San Francisco mayor does have a fiscal weapon -- her own family 
finances. But Wilson's persistent questioning about the sources of income of 
her husband, Richard C. Blum, could raise the risk of political fallout if Blum 
again bails out her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Blum, who with Feinstein advanced about $3 million to her campaign in the 
primary, recently told reporters that he hoped not to be tapped again. But he 
refused to rule out future donations, saying with a smile that he wanted to 
"leave the suspense" intact. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's current job has given him strong leverage in his fund-raising effort. 
If he wins, he will be governor, and if he loses he will be senator for four 
more years before standing again for election. In either case, he is well 
positioned to affect California industries. 
</P>
<P>
To play against the incumbency edge, Feinstein's campaign has long portrayed 
Wilson as using his Senate seat to benefit his contributors. Most recently, she 
tried to show that Wilson had acted on behalf of the savings and loan industry 
after receiving more than $243,000 in campaign contributions from thrift 
connections in the past nine years. 
</P>
<P>
In an article that played to that theme, the Wall Street Journal last week 
reported that a Wilson aide had helped set up a meeting between movie industry 
officials and a Justice Department attorney, after which the department 
re-evaluated a legal ruling that had hurt the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting occurred a month before movie industry officials held a $250,000 
fund-raiser for Wilson, the Journal reported. An irked Wilson said that the two 
were not connected and added that he has been actively helping the movie 
industry since he assumed office in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been more than happy to seek the legitimate interest of any number of 
California industries who employ hundreds and thousands of Californians and I 
do that because it is my job," Wilson told reporters at a press conference last 
week. " . . . I clearly wouldn't favor seeking a goal that I did not think 
legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
Asked directly if he traded favors for campaign contributions, Wilson 
responded. "No, I do not." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "I would hardly expect them to want to give to an opponent when 
someone has done a good job."

ON CALIFORNIA: THIRSTY STATE CASTS WEATHER EYE TO WINTER

Where I grew up, in Tennessee, weather was a very different thing from what we 
get in California. Tennessee weather was the source of considerable surprise. 
We had the occasional tornado and whole seasons of dark, violent thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
This was continental weather. In summer the thunderheads would gather quickly, 
as if from nowhere, and turn day into dusk. The smell of the city would change 
to a muskiness, even before the rain hit, and we knew we were being warned. 
These storms could tear down trees with their power and send sheets of 
lightning. 
</P>
<P>
I remember sitting once in a Little League dugout, watching the field fill with 
water, wondering where these storms came from. They rolled in from every 
direction and seemed to lurk just over the horizon. In Tennessee, you never 
knew. 
</P>
<P>
In California, of course, we know. Our rain always comes from the west, from 
the Pacific. The storms are carried to us by winds that work with such 
monotonous regularity as to seem idiotic. Our rain is as predictable and benign 
as our sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
Or it used to be. California weather has turned out to have a few secrets of 
its own. We are now four years into a drought and facing a new winter. A new 
season when the rains will, or will not, come. 
</P>
<P>
Never, in living memory, has any one season mattered so much to California. If 
the rains come, life as we know it will resume. Lawns will stay green. A daily 
shower will remain a birthright. If the rains do not come, California will 
enter a new age, and it will not be pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime between November and March, we will all know the outcome. But this 
being California, no one wants to wait that long. And that brings us here, to 
La Jolla. At the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, they know the answer to 
California's future already exists and they know where. Out there in the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Our winter is being formed right now in the chaos of ocean swirls and 
atmospheric eddies. Within that chaos is a embryonic pattern -- you might think 
of it as a fetal winter -- that will eventually grow, dominate the weather of 
the eastern Pacific, and govern our rains. The problem is finding it. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Cayan, a climate researcher here, points to an area of the Pacific 
somewhere off the coast of Oregon and Washington. "That's the G-spot for rain," 
he says. If a zone of low barometric pressure establishes itself there, Cayan 
believes, California is home free. The low pressure will pull storms toward it 
and then steer them straight for our coast. 
</P>
<P>
But what comes before that? What puts the low pressure in the G-spot? It may be 
the presence of warm sea temperatures in the eastern Pacific which heat the 
atmosphere. Or something more complex. Records of big rain years in the past 
show a combination of warm and cold zones off Baja and the Southern California 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
Cayan pulled out a weather map from 1969, one of the wettest years in recent 
history. There was the warm trough of ocean just below the cold trough, and the 
huge low-pressure area off the northwest. But even if he saw these conditions 
developing now, Cayan says, he could not guarantee a wet winter for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Just last year, he says, the weather patterns looked very good for rain until 
December. Then conditions suddenly reversed themselves, a high-pressure zone 
replaced the low-pressure zone, and our winter turned sunny and dry. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, our fetal winters have proved extraordinarily difficult to find. 
And making predictions in the face of the uncertainties demands a recklessness 
not commonly found among scientists. Jerome Namias, Scripps' most well-known 
climate scientist and a man who likes the gamble, once made public forecasts 
each fall. 
</P>
<P>
Namias suffered a stroke last year, however, and it looks unlikely that Cayan 
or any of his colleagues will step in to take his place. Perhaps the younger 
men are less willing to take the risk. Perhaps they are simply more mindful of 
their fallibility. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, we will wait and watch. In Tennessee, if one season turned dry we 
could always hope to make it up the next. In that way, a poor summer could be 
balanced by a wet autumn, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Not so with us. We have only one chance per year, and that chance is coming. By 
November, I suspect we will all be converted to weathermen. We will look out 
the window each morning and will not need the Scripps Institution to tell us 
whether our simple, monotonous rains have come home.

2 PLO RADICALS JOIN IN THREAT TO 'STRIKE U.S. INTERESTS';

<P>
JORDAN: ACTION IS URGED IF GIS ATTACK IRAQ. KING HUSSEIN MEETS THE PAIR, WHO 
HAVE LONG BACKED TERRORISM.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein met with two old rivals from the Palestine Liberation 
Organization shortly before they joined other pro-Iraqi groups Monday in a call 
to "strike American interests everywhere" if U.S. troops attack Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein met with George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh, who head Marxist factions of 
the PLO and have a long history of supporting international terrorism. The 
Jordanian government announced the meeting Monday and said it took place late 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Habash and Hawatmeh were expelled from Jordan 20 years ago when King Hussein 
ordered his army to clear PLO militias from his country on grounds that they 
were preparing to overthrow him. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Hussein, which was not reported by the Jordanian press, 
reflects the lengths to which the Jordanian monarch has gone to keep up with 
public sentiment in favor of Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Habash and Hawatmeh took center stage at the three-day Conference of Arab 
Popular Movements, which issued a statement calling for attacks against 
American interests. 
</P>
<P>
The statement also expressed support for the holy war proposed by Iraq's 
President Saddam Hussein and appealed for Arabs to unite in an effort to break 
the embargo on trade with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The delegates, representing political parties, guerrilla groups and labor 
unions, said they will challenge the embargo by shipping food and medicine to 
Iraq by sea. 
</P>
<P>
In order to plan the "strike against American interests everywhere and by all 
means at the same moment an American military attack is launched against Iraq," 
the delegates agreed to establish a permanent committee with headquarters in 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, the term "strike against" is often used as a synonym for 
terror. Such a call, issued in King Hussein's capital, is likely to further 
erode his reputation in the West as a moderate. He is already viewed with 
displeasure in some Western capitals because of his early support for Iraq's 
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein has since tried to present himself as a neutral broker between 
Iraq's President Hussein and the rest of the world, but his diplomatic effort 
has accomplished virtually nothing, despite personal visits to capitals in the 
Middle East, North Africa and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Since returning to Jordan 12 days ago, the king has stayed largely out of 
public view and has resigned himself to staying on the sidelines while events 
take their course, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
In his diplomatic travels, King Hussein sought to promote an Iraqi withdrawal 
from Kuwait in exchange for a U.S. withdrawal from Saudi Arabia. He is said to 
have been received coldly in Iraq, the last stop on his trip. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq contends that it has a historic right to Kuwait, but Washington and most 
of the rest of the international community are insisting on the unconditional 
withdrawal of Iraqi troops and restoration of the deposed royal family in 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein's present attitude is in sharp contrast to his earlier energetic 
promotion of an "Arab solution" to the conflict. A senior Jordanian official, 
asked to comment on this, replied: "What can the king tell the people? Things 
have got out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
A former Jordanian official said: "I would say that the king will now sit back 
and wait. There is not much that can be done given the positions of both 
sides." 
</P>
<P>
The PLO has supported Iraq in hopes that the crisis over Kuwait will have a 
positive effect on the Palestinian desire for an independent Palestinian state 
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least half of Jordan's 3 
million people consider themselves Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
It was Palestinian support for Iraq that led King Hussein to permit Habash and 
Hawatmeh to return to this country, if only for the three days of the 
conference. And the visiting Palestinians have been careful not to tread on 
Jordanian sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Mistakes will not recur," said Hawatmeh, who heads the Democratic Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine, a small PLO faction. 
</P>
<P>
Habash heads the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Both groups 
regard terror as a key weapon in battling Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians commemorate the expulsion of the PLO from Jordan as Black 
September. The banishment was a step in a PLO odyssey that took it to Lebanon 
and then, after Israel's invasion of Lebanon, to countries scattered across the 
Arab world. Recently it has found a welcome home in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Jordan has given space to an array of PLO factions to carry 
on political activity. The opening followed food riots that shook the regime 
and prompted King Hussein to try to broaden his popular support. 
</P>
<P>
But democratization, his advisers told him, is one thing and a PLO presence led 
by old enemies of the regime is another. They insisted that neither Hawatmeh 
nor Habash be permitted to take up residence in Jordan. 
</P>

Across the Jordan River in Israel, officials have watched the budding PLO 
presence in Amman with suspicion. Some Israeli politicians have blamed 
occasional border incidents involving Jordanian soldiers on the king's new 
tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have also warned that King Hussein's rule is being made 
unstable by the Palestinian rush to support Iraq.

The foreign ministers of the 12 nations of the European Community agreed Monday 
to expel military personnel from the Iraqi embassies in their capitals and to 
limit the freedom of other Iraqi diplomats to travel within their borders. 
</P>
<P>
But the foreign ministers, in their second such joint effort, again fell short 
of consensus on financial aid to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt, which have lost 
substantial export markets because of the U.N. economic embargo against Iraq 
and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement citing last week's Iraqi incursions against the French, Belgian 
and Dutch embassies in Kuwait, the ministers said they "have decided jointly to 
expel military personnel based in Iraqi embassies and to limit the freedom of 
movement of personnel in those embassies." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the three European diplomatic compounds, Iraqi troops also 
raided the Canadian Embassy in Kuwait last week. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the joint announcement, Britain expelled six Iraqi Embassy staff 
members in London and ordered 23 more Iraqi nationals in Britain to return 
home, while Belgium restricted the movement of Iraqi diplomats to a small area 
around Brussels. Italy had announced similar action Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said his government was expelling the 
Iraqis, among them two defense attaches and four staff members in the embassy's 
military section, as an expression of solidarity with European allies. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and has ordered all foreign diplomats out of 
Kuwait on grounds that it is no longer an independent country. Iraqi troops 
ring the many embassies where diplomats have refused to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The European foreign ministers also considered but postponed action on a 
proposal by Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community, that the 
EC dedicate about $2 billion to assisting Turkey, Jordan and Egypt. Half the 
money would come from the EC budget and half from the 12 member nations. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Hurd argued that any such aid formula should take into account the 
substantial contributions that some European nations, including Britain, have 
already made to the U.S.-led multinational force in the Persian Gulf area to 
prevent further Iraqi aggression, particularly against Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Just 10 days earlier, the European foreign ministers, meeting in Rome, had 
agreed in principle on an aid package to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt, although 
they did not set an amount. The finance ministers of the 12 nations, meeting 
the next day, cautioned that any aid should be approved only after a thorough 
study of the recipients' needs and the donors' abilities to pay. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which dominates the multinational military force arrayed in 
the gulf after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, had asked the European nations to 
help defray the cost of the buildup, or, short of that, to help the nations 
suffering from the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the reluctance of the 12 nations to act jointly, at least seven of them 
have contributed in one way or another to the multinational military presence 
in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, which has constitutional restrictions on what it can do 
militarily, has contributed minesweepers and vehicles capable of detecting and 
analyzing the presence of poison gases. Iraq has chemical weapons and, 
according to the U.S. mission to the European Community, West Germany is ahead 
of the United States in the development of chemical weapons survey vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Also, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Saturday pledged $2 billion, about 
half to defray the costs of the military buildup in the gulf and half to assist 
Turkey, Jordan and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
France, provoked by the Iraqi raid on its embassy in Kuwait, announced Saturday 
that it would send 4,000 ground troops to Saudi Arabia as well as aircraft and 
tanks, to bolster the three warships it had already dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has sent 6,000 troops and seven warships, as well as fighter aircraft. 
Italy has dispatched five warships. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other EC nations, Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain have made 
smaller contributions to the force in the gulf region. Beyond that, according 
to a U.S. survey, Greece has offered three vessels for sea-lift purposes, and 
Portugal has turned away an Iraqi merchant vessel that had been scheduled for 
repairs at a Portuguese shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd told reporters that Britain ordered the Iraqi expulsions because of a 
conviction "that we've got to act in solidarity with the French and the other 
countries whose embassies have been invaded and people taken out during the 
last few days." 
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary David Waddington, who announced the details of the expulsion in 
London, said that he considered their presence "not to be conducive to the 
public good for reasons of national security." He provided no names of the 
civilians involved, but most are believed to include students and, possibly, 
business people. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's ambassador to Britain said the expulsions are unfair.

A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS;

<P>
DIPLOMATIC FRONT: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "very grave illegal acts" by Iraqis who raided Western embassy 
buildings in Kuwait, 12 European Community governments agreed to expel Iraqi 
military attaches and restrict the movements of other Iraqi diplomats. They 
also agreed to pressure countries suspected of not respecting U.N. sanctions 
against Iraq. Further sanctions also got a boost as President Bush endorsed 
expanding the trade embargo to include air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
In meetings with senior U.S. officials, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens 
expressed concern about an expected $20 billion increase in U.S. arms sales to 
Saudi Arabia and asked for additional aid. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union and 
Saudi Arabia restored diplomatic relations after a break of 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Michael J. Dugan was fired as Air Force chief of staff for his blunt 
comments about U.S. contingency plans for massive air strikes whose targets 
would include Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his family. The four-star 
general said he regretted any embarrassment that his comments may have caused 
the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hostage Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops randomly seized young men fleeing Kuwait but let their sobbing 
wives, mothers and older men continue into Saudi Arabia. Refugees said busloads 
of men between the ages of 17 and 45 were seen being shipped north, toward 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In Jordan, officials shut down the last of three infamous refugee camps and 
moved the last of the residents to a clean, efficient village of tents to await 
their turn to go home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trade Front: 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices soared to their highest levels in seven years as supply fears and 
further jitters over the Mideast crisis swept through the market. Oil futures 
soared to record levels, above $33 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crisis Indicators: 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. troops in/near Saudi Arabia: more than 150,000 
</P>

BUSH HOPES NATION'S WILL IS STEADFAST; 
</P>
<P>
HOME FRONT: HE ACKNOWLEDGES WONDERING HOW LONG SUPPORT WOULD LAST IN CASE OF 
WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush said Monday that the nation has been "magnificently united" 
behind his stand against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but he acknowledged 
wondering how long the support would last if a war broke out or a protracted, 
costly stalemate developed. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously omitting the nation's long, divisive experience in Vietnam -- and 
the ruined presidency of another Texan, Lyndon B. Johnson -- Bush instead said 
that he hopes he will find the sort of backing that Americans showed for the 
Allied effort in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm old enough to remember a clear-cut case, different circumstances, 
different times -- World War II. There was a lot of sorrow; there was a lot of 
regret. Everyone identified with the families who lost loved ones. But the 
country stayed fairly well together," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, public opinion polls have shown overwhelming support for the 
President's actions. A Washington Post-ABC News poll made public a week ago 
found that 78% of those surveyed approved of Bush's handling of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not clear in my own mind at how long this kind of support holds up," Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will not predict "how the American people would respond" if 
casualties numbered in the thousands. And, asked if the support would erode if 
a stalemate evolved, he said that he has read predictions that it would. "I 
think about those questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Until Monday, there had been little, if any, public talk on the part of the 
President about public support for Operation Desert Shield, which has sent more 
than 150,000 U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf in the largest such speedy 
deployment since World War II. But, in response to questions at a news 
conference with reporters from outside Washington, Bush returned several times 
to the topic. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is particularly sensitive because of the Vietnam War, in which 
eventual lack of public support became a key factor in the course of the war. 
On a recent political trip to Topeka, Kan., and Tallahassee, Fla., Bush made a 
point of mentioning local GIs serving in Saudi Arabia, in effect reminding his 
audience that support for the policy means support for young men and women from 
their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the question of public support has been raised repeatedly by 
troops deployed in the Saudi Arabian desert when they are visited by senior 
officials from Washington, who are themselves mindful of the impact public 
opinion back home can have on the morale of military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was asked Monday about the possibility that the Pentagon has been given "a 
blank check" to pay for the operation -- which the Defense Department has 
estimated will cost $11.3 billion next year. In his answer, he referred to his 
stated goals -- removing the occupying Iraqi troops from Kuwait, which they 
invaded Aug. 2, restoring the Kuwaiti government, defending Saudi Arabia from 
Iraqi attack and gaining the freedom of Iraqi-held hostages. Then he said: 
</P>
<P>
"I think the American people want me to do exactly what we ought to do to 
fulfill our four objectives over there. And if that means that we have to ask 
others to support certain aspects of this in a burden-sharing way, we're going 
to continue to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"But I believe that the American people have confidence in the decisions that 
we've taken, and I don't think that they would want to shortchange that effort 
no matter how serious the budget complications are right now," he added. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
The leading Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. William S. 
Broomfield of Michigan, said the United States cannot afford the 
Administration's decision to cancel Egypt's $7.1-billion military sales debt to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration said it will seek help from international lending agencies 
to ease the economic hardships of Middle East nations suffering from the 
Persian Gulf crisis. Japan, West Germany, Saudi Arabia and the exiled 
government of Kuwait have contributed to the $28-billion pool of money the 
Administration is trying to gather. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens pressed the United States for more arms 
and received assurances from Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that his country 
will be compensated for the huge U.S. arms deal with Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon 
said that Cheney "reiterated the U.S. commitment to maintain Israel's 
qualitative military edge." 
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering met with his four 
colleagues who hold permanent seats in the Security Council -- the 
representatives of the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- to discuss 
further tightening of the U.N. sanctions against Iraq. One diplomat said the 
Soviet Union and China objected to further measures until members could 
evaluate the effectiveness of the current embargo.

A judge in Miami dismissed a $50-million damage suit accusing the U.S.-backed 
Contras of torturing and executing an American during the Nicaraguan civil war. 
U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus said the case intruded into the diplomatic 
arena. Benjamin Linder, 27, of Portland, Ore., was shot to death in Nicaragua 
in 1987 when the rebels attacked the rural hydroelectric project he was helping 
to build. A year later, his family, with the backing of the New York-based 
Center for Constitutional Rights, sued Miami-based Contra leaders Enrique 
Bermudez, Adolfo Calero and Aristides Sanchez.

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Monday that he will run for president of 
Poland, a job now held by the general who once imprisoned him and sought to 
crush his labor union. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa said he hoped to speed the nation's transition from communism to 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Post-Communist Poland's first fully democratic presidential and parliament 
elections are expected as early as this fall and no later than spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Today I made up my mind. I am putting forward for society's approval my 
readiness to be a candidate for the post of president of the Polish Republic in 
popular elections," Walesa said. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it is a fulfillment of the pledge I made in August, 1980," he said, 
when he catapulted to worldwide fame by leading strikes that helped create the 
East Bloc's first independent trade union. 
</P>
<P>
When Solidarity was created 10 years ago, Walesa pledged that he would fight 
for the overthrow of communism and the establishment of full democracy in 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa has hinted at his presidential intentions for nearly a year, saying he 
needs to take the post to spur political and economic reforms. In June, he 
said: "I do not want to be president. I will have to be president."

<P>
China and Vietnam, which fought a brief border war in 1979, have taken a major 
step toward reconciliation with a heretofore secret meeting between leaders of 
the two nations earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Van Linh, the Vietnamese Communist Party chief, Premier Do Muoi and 
former Premier Pham Van Dong met in China earlier this month with Chinese 
Premier Li Peng, and apparently also with the Chinese Communist Party general 
secretary, Jiang Zemin, diplomats in Beijing and Bangkok told reporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
One result of the changing Sino-Vietnamese relationship was rival Cambodian 
factions' acceptance last week of a United Nations Security Council plan for 
ending the fighting in their nation. Beijing and Hanoi have backed opposing 
sides in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored pact encompasses the establishment of a Supreme National 
Council, representing Cambodia's Vietnam-backed government and its guerrilla 
opponents, to exercise Cambodian sovereignty while elections are arranged under 
U.N. auspices. 
</P>
<P>
The council's 12 members, accompanied by about 40 aides, met for the first time 
Monday at the Cambodian Embassy in Bangkok. No progress was reported after 
three hours of talks, but delegates said that a second session would meet this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of Sino-Vietnamese reconciliation came Sunday, when 110 athletes 
from Vietnam traveled by train to Beijing. The group, to participate in the 
Asian Games set to begin in Beijing on Saturday, was the first large, official 
delegation to cross the land border since the 1979 war. 
</P>
<P>
The official Voice of Vietnam radio reported Monday that a Lang Son Province 
official, speaking at a send-off ceremony for the athletes, said the event 
opened "a new possibility for the restoration of solidarity, friendship and 
good-neighborliness between the two peoples." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Deputy Premier Vo Nguyen Giap will visit Beijing later this week, 
the Vietnamese radio said, and will attend the Asian Games as a "distinguished 
guest" of the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing provided Hanoi with key support during the Vietnam War, the 
two nations split over the issue of Cambodia, which Vietnam invaded in late 
1978 to oust the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge regime and install the current 
Phnom Penh government. China retaliated by attacking Vietnam in early 1979. In 
recent years, the two nations have also clashed over the Spratly Islands in the 
South China Sea, which both claim. 
</P>
<P>
Hanoi has long sought an improvement in relations, but Beijing has insisted 
that ties could not be normalized without a settlement in Cambodia that 
included the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the political liberalization 
sweeping the Soviet Union are pressuring leaders of Vietnam and China to settle 
their differences so that their nations might avoid similar upheavals. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-summer, amid signs that the Cambodian conflict was nearing a 
settlement, Chinese officials have indicated an easing of Sino-Vietnamese 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li, during a visit to Singapore in August, said that "along with a 
settlement of the Cambodian question, China would like to normalize relations 
with Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Premier Muoi responded favorably to what he described as Li's 
comments "on the normalization of Vietnamese relations and the settlement of 
disputes through peaceful negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
"These are actually what Vietnam has many times proposed, and of which Vietnam 
has always wished to see early materialization," Muoi said. "Vietnam holds that 
the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations fully meets the interests of the 
two peoples and will be an important contribution to consolidating peace and 
stability in the region."

At least 30,000 people rallied in Sofia, Bulgaria, to cheer on the opposition 
to the ruling Socialist Party. Speakers addressing the crowd emphasized the 
unwillingness of the Union of Democratic Forces to join a coalition government 
with the Socialists, the renamed Communist Party. Dimitar Ludzhev, a prominent 
opposition politician, said: "We will do everything possible (to ensure) that 
the country faces a new election in the shortest time, an election which the 
democratic forces can win . . . and the UDF and democracy will win."

For the fourth time in four attempts since May, NASA engineers Monday evening 
detected a leak of potentially explosive hydrogen while fueling a space 
shuttle, forcing them to scrub the launch of the shuttle Columbia with the 
Astro observatory. 
</P>
<P>
NASA engineers continued loading hydrogen fuel aboard the shuttle after the 
launch was scrubbed at 3:35 p.m. PDT, seven hours before the scheduled liftoff, 
in hopes that trouble-shooting would allow them to detect the source of the 
leak. By mid-evening, however, it appeared unlikely that the leak would be 
easily detected and repaired for another attempt at a launch this evening or 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
NASA associate administrator William Lenoir said Monday that if Columbia could 
not be launched in that time frame, its mission most likely would be delayed 
until after the scheduled Oct. 5 launch of the shuttle Discovery, and possibly 
even longer. 
</P>
<P>
"We would go fly the other two birds (Discovery and Atlantis) while we fix this 
one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding a possible second launch attempt this week, Keith L. Hudkins, 
director of NASA's shuttle orbiter division, said: "I don't think we can solve 
it in that length of time." 
</P>
<P>
The space agency has only until the middle of this week for another launch 
attempt because of a self-imposed three-week gap that must occur between 
shuttle launches. 
</P>
<P>
The constraint on this launch is the planned Oct. 5 launch of Discovery 
carrying the high-priority Ulysses probe that will slingshot around Jupiter to 
achieve a polar orbit around the sun. 
</P>
<P>
If Discovery is not launched by Oct. 28, NASA officials will have to wait for 
13 months before the planets are in the proper alignment once again. 
</P>
<P>
After another launch attempt was scrubbed 1 1/2 weeks ago because of another 
hydrogen leak, engineers suspected a leak in a recirculating pump that forces 
liquid hydrogen through the three shuttle engines to cool them before launch. 
The recirculating pump was changed, but technicians could find no leak in it 
when it was tested. 
</P>
<P>
During the testing associated with the pump changeover, however, engineers 
found a crushed seal in a valve that normally permits hydrogen to enter engine 
number three. Space shuttle director Robert Crippen said Monday that 
technicians had determined that the crushed seal could account for the volume 
of leakage that was observed last time. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials were obviously distressed and just as obviously mystified when 
the leak reappeared Monday. In their attempt to isolate the leak, they were 
pumping liquid hydrogen through the engines and opening and closing various 
valves in order to narrow down the area that must be searched. 
</P>
<P>
But Hudkins said that even if they find a likely source of the leak, it will 
take at least 15 hours to get into the aft compartment, meaning that another 
launch attempt could not be made until Wednesday at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Astro is a $150-million package of four telescopes designed to view the hottest 
and most violent objects in the universe at ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths 
that are inaccessible to Earth-bound telescopes because of atmospheric 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
Crippen said that the best chance of finding the leak will require installing 
lights and television compartments in the aft compartment and conducting a 
visual search during another fueling. He said that, because of the size of the 
leak, more than 20,000 standard cubic inches per minute, it should be readily 
visible. 
</P>
<P>
Crippen said he now believes the most likely cause of the leak is a through 
inspection of the engine assembly that was conducted after Columbia's last 
flight. After the flight, engineers had found traces of Carborundum -- 
particulate matter used in very fine sanding paper -- in the shuttle fuel 
system. The Carborundum paper was apparently left on top of the mobile launch 
platform, which carries the shuttle from the vehicle assembly building to the 
launch pad, when the platform was refurbished before Columbia's last mission. 
</P>
<P>
The paper evidently got sucked into the fuel system, apparently during fueling. 
Engineers found no trace of the Carborundum in the engine assembly when they 
inspected it, but apparently they created one or more leaks during the 
inspection process. "Obviously, it's a leak that we cannot pick up by our 
normal method of assessing leaks with liquid helium," which is not as cold as 
liquid hydrogen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
They will thus have to find the leak while Columbia is on the launch pad 
because they have no capability for pumping liquid hydrogen through the system 
anywhere else. 
</P>

and most violent objects in the universe at ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths 
that are inaccessible to Earth-bound telescopes because of atmospheric 
interference.

LEAKING FUEL AGAIN SCRUBS SHUTTLE COLUMBIA LAUNCH

For the fourth time in four attempts since May, NASA engineers Monday evening 
detected a leak of potentially explosive hydrogen while fueling a space 
shuttle, forcing them to scrub the launch of the shuttle Columbia with the 
Astro observatory for at least two months. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time the mission has been aborted because of a hydrogen leak 
discovered only hours before the scheduled launch time. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference shortly after the scrubbed launch, space shuttle director 
Robert Crippen said: "The next vehicle up will be Ulysses" -- the shuttle 
Discovery carrying the Ulysses probe that will be sent into a polar orbit 
around the sun. It is now scheduled for an Oct. 5 launch. 
</P>
<P>
After the Columbia launch was scrubbed at 3:35 p.m. PDT, seven hours before the 
scheduled liftoff, NASA engineers continued loading hydrogen fuel aboard the 
shuttle in hopes that trouble-shooting might allow them to identify an obvious 
source of the leak. By late evening, however, it was clear that that prayer was 
not going to be answered, and Crippen decided to scrub the launch so that more 
extensive studies could be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Crippen also said the agency was considering performing a fueling test on 
Discovery to ensure that it does not have a leak that would imperil the 
high-priority Ulysses mission. Discovery must be launched by Oct. 28 so that 
Ulysses can perform a slingshot maneuver around Jupiter to enter its polar 
orbit around the sun. If it is not launched by that date, NASA must wait 
another 13 months before the planets are once again in the proper alignment. 
</P>
<P>
Performing a tanking test would add at least five days to pre-launch 
preparations for Discovery even if no leak were found. That would eat into the 
agency's 18-day window for the launch. 
</P>
<P>
Crippen said, however, that he believes the leak is unique to Columbia and that 
"there is no reason I know of to suspect a leak in Discovery." 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that there would be no danger in attempting to launch discovery 
without performing a fueling test first. "The only risk . . . is that it will 
be unsuccessful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA has twice thought it had the hydrogen leak in Columbia corrected. After 
the first scrubbed launch in May, technicians found a large leak in a valve, 
called a 17-inch disconnect, that connects the external fuel tank to the 
shuttle orbiter. A similar leak was subsequently found on Atlantis, which was 
scheduled to carry a Department of Defense spy satellite into orbit in July. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the leak was traced to microscopic glass beads that contaminated 
the 17-inch valve, preventing gaskets from sealing properly. That valve did not 
leak Monday evening, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
After another launch attempt was scrubbed 1 1/2 weeks ago because of another 
hydrogen leak, engineers suspected a leak in a recirculating pump that forces 
liquid hydrogen through the three shuttle engines to cool them before launch. 
The recirculating pump was changed, but technicians could find no leak in it 
when it was tested. 
</P>
<P>
During the testing associated with the pump changeover, however, engineers 
found a crushed seal in a valve that normally permits hydrogen to enter engine 
No. 3. Earlier Monday, before the launch attempt, Crippen said that technicians 
had determined that the crushed seal could account for the volume of leakage 
that was observed last time. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials were obviously distressed and just as obviously mystified when 
the leak reappeared Monday. In their attempt to isolate the leak, they were 
pumping liquid hydrogen through the engines and opening and closing various 
valves in order to narrow down the area that must be searched.

Mandatory reporting of AIDS infection "makes all the sense in the world" to 
help Americans stricken by the virus receive proper care, a federal health 
official told the National AIDS Commission on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James W. Curran, director of the HIV/AIDS program for the federal Centers 
for Disease Control in Atlanta, said he thinks the time has come to start 
keeping confidential government records listing the names of people infected 
with the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS activists have long argued against such mandatory reporting, saying they 
fear that health agencies cannot ensure that the names of HIV-infected people 
will not become public. About 20 states require mandatory reporting of the 
names of HIV-infected people to health officials. However, only a handful 
actually are implementing that policy, Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
The expense of offering HIV-infected people the proper medical treatment 
appears to be a major reason that states are dragging their feet in requiring 
HIV infection to be reported, he said.

TWO VIEWS OF SALCIDO EMERGE AT MURDER TRIAL

During opening statements Monday at his murder trial, two pictures of Ramon 
Salcido emerged -- one of a cold-blooded killer who planned nine murders and 
succeeded with seven, the other of a heartbroken drunk in the midst of a 
"psychotic depression." 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma County Chief Deputy District Attorney Peter Bumerts told the 
eight-woman, four-man jury that Salcido had carefully planned the April 14, 
1989 murders after a string of personal setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence will show that Ramon Salcido targeted nine people for death," 
said Bumerts. "He had a reason why each should die and he then set about to 
kill them, and it was only happenstance that saved two of them." 
</P>
<P>
Salcido, wearing a gray suit, had tears in his eyes as his crimes were 
mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido is accused of killing his wife, two of his three daughters, his 
mother-in-law and her two daughters and a co-worker. He also faces three counts 
of attempted murder for attacks on a third daughter and another co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido was arrested near his birthplace in Mexico within a week of the 
massacre and confessed to authorities. That videotaped confession will play a 
major role in the case, Bumerts said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Marteen Miller, who concedes his client committed the 
killings, says Salcido should not be convicted of first-degree murder because 
he was not capable of planning the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he argued, Salcido's rage began simmering a year after his 1985 
marriage when his wife, Angela, told him Sofia, the daughter she was carrying 
at the wedding, was not his. 
</P>
<P>
"Though he remained with her and fathered her two subsequent children, the 
anger and humiliation . . . stayed with him and surfaced later on," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving a demand for child support from his previous wife, he returned 
home early the day the murders were committed, drunk and high on cocaine. 
Angela either was gone or left shortly after he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
In his confession, Salcido said he drove around for a while, his daughters in 
the car with him, while he looked for his wife and decided to kill the 
children.

LIFE SENTENCE GIVEN MAN WHO HAD DAUGHTER, 14, KILL HIS WIFE

Likening him to Charles Manson as a "master manipulator," a judge on Monday 
ordered computer whiz David Brown to spend the rest of his life in prison 
without parole for orchestrating his wife's 1985 murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Brown, you're a scary person," Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald 
A. McCartin told the 37-year-old defendant, who was convicted of murder in June 
for setting up his devoted 14-year-old daughter to murder his fifth wife while 
she slept. 
</P>
<P>
While his daughter sat silently in prison for nearly four years, the Anaheim 
Hills man collected $835,000 from the victim's insurance policy and lived in 
opulence with his new wife -- the victim's teen-age sister -- whom he recruited 
to aid in the murder and then secretly wed. 
</P>
<P>
In imposing the heaviest sentence open to him, McCartin said that if the 
district attorney's office had pursued the death penalty against Brown, the 
judge might well have sent him to the gas chamber for his "unbelievable" 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's best hope for a more lenient sentence was to have McCartin strike down 
the jury's finding that he killed his wife for financial gain, thus opening up 
the possibility of parole. But McCartin said there was ample evidence to 
suggest that the insurance money was "certainly a co-motive" in the crime and 
warranted life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view," McCartin said in an interview, "he got a break when the D.A. 
dropped the death penalty. It would have been a tough call (for the judge) to 
make when you're dealing with someone who's never been in trouble with the law 
before. But this case is the most bizarre I've ever heard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe that someone could have that much control over other 
people," the judge added. 
</P>
<P>
He called Brown a "master manipulator" and told him during sentencing that his 
ability to betray those close to him and "not bat an eye" was amazing. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes Charles Manson look like a piker," said McCartin.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; 
</P>
<P>
GARAMENDI PROMISES FAST PAYMENT, FRAUD PROSECUTION 
</P>

Saying that realistically the Legislature will not adopt no-fault insurance, 
John Garamendi, Democratic candidate for insurance commissioner, vowed Monday 
that if elected he will pursue other reforms that he said would put a brake on 
auto insurance prices and stem costly litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi, addressing the Town Hall speaking club in Los Angeles, pledged to 
put strict regulations in place for faster payment of claims by insurers, keep 
records of how quickly companies are paying the claims and make the results 
public "so everybody can see if they really are in the hands of the 'good 
hands' people." 
</P>
<P>
Faster payment of claims means that 60% of accident victims no longer will 
"require a lawyer to get a settlement," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
He also promised to step up prosecution of auto insurance fraud by requiring 
that all autos be photographed at the time an owner purchases insurance and 
before and after repairs. He also said he would set up a centralized data bank 
to compare claims and thus identify those -- including doctors and lawyers -- 
who are filing or helping to file fraudulent claims. 
</P>
<P>
"By the end of my four-year term, Los Angeles will no longer be called the 
fraud capital of this nation," Garamendi said, predicting that prices would be 
favorably affected. 
</P>
<P>
He added that companies seeking higher rates under California's new "prior 
approval" system of regulation would, under his administration, have to provide 
audited financial information to justify the increases. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the audience, which included many from the insurance industry, 
said during a question-and-answer session that they sensed that, since the 
primary, Garamendi has moved away from industry positions and toward the stand 
on insurance issues taken by the state's powerful trial lawyer lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi denied that he has changed his position. He said he simply believes 
that the no-fault battle has gone on for 20 years in the Legislature without 
result and it is time to try other solutions. After his speech, he remarked 
that since Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) is against a 
no-fault system, its chances in the foreseeable future in California are nil. 
</P>
<P>
No-fault insurance, under which accident victims collect for their damages from 
their own insurer rather than through the courts, has been heavily supported by 
insurers as the best way to cut insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi a decade ago introduced a no-fault bill that was unsuccessful, but 
during the primary campaign he said he opposed no-fault. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi said in his talk that he has become convinced that without other 
reforms, no-fault will not control costs. "Yes, we do need to reduce the cost 
of litigation, but it does not by itself reduce significantly the cost of auto 
insurance," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
In taking this position, the Democratic candidate placed himself at odds with 
his Republican opponent, Wes Bannister, and outgoing Insurance Commissioner 
Roxani Gillespie, who have backed no-fault. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi did not mention Bannister in his talk, but was critical of Gillespie 
for what he termed her failure to implement Proposition 103, the insurance 
initiative approved by California voters, and to protect and assist the state's 
insurance consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Insurance is at the moment challenging a court order forcing 
it to process consumer complaints," he noted. "Apparently, it still wants to 
continue its old practice of taking complaints once a month up to the trash 
bin." The consumer hot line, he added, "is better known as the constantly busy 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Bannister is scheduled to address Town Hall Oct. 2.

GROWERS PLAY UP PESTICIDE MEASURE'S MEDFLY PROVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Backers of Proposition 135, a grower-financed pesticide initiative on the 
November ballot, kicked off their campaign Monday by appealing to Southern 
Californians frustrated by aerial sprayings of malathion to eradicate the 
Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
Gathered in a wholesale fruit market in Los Angeles, the measure's proponents 
made it clear they are out to defeat Proposition 128, a rival initiative known 
by its supporters as "Big Green." That measure would ban at least 20 pesticides 
that cause cancer or birth defects in humans or laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
"Our initiative does something that Proposition 128 does not do," said Bob L. 
Vice, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation. "It speaks to the 
issue of the Medfly problem." 
</P>
<P>
By calling for doubling the production of sterile Medflies, the growers' 
initiative is designed to tap into widespread irritation in Southern California 
over aerial spraying. Without banning spraying, Proposition 135 attempts to 
ensure a greater supply of sterile Medflies, which could reduce aerial 
pesticide application in future eradication campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Proposition 135 denounced the Medfly provision as a "cynical ploy" 
to confuse voters about which measure actually does more to remove unsafe 
pesticides from the market. Indeed, many of the supporters of Proposition 135 
have defended aerial spraying in the past, while some of the architects of 
Proposition 128, which does not address Medfly spraying, have been outspoken 
against the eradication campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Food and Agriculture already has the power to (increase 
sterile Medfly production). . . ," said Proposition 128 supporter David Bunn, 
research director for Pesticide Watch, an environmental group. "Proposing this 
language is like a slap in the face, coming from the most vociferous advocates 
of spraying pesticides on people." 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural interests placed Proposition 135 on the ballot in an attempt to 
nullify the more stringent pesticide provisions in Proposition 128. If 
Proposition 135 gets more votes than its rival, the growers' measure will 
become law. While Proposition 128 would create an elected environmental 
advocate to enforce environmental laws, the growers' measure would make the 
governor-appointed secretary for environmental affairs responsible for 
overseeing pesticide laws. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 135 say their measure would double the amount of 
testing for pesticide residue on foods. Opponents contend that the measure 
actually would reduce pesticide monitoring by transferring the cost of the 
program -- now paid for in part by a tax on pesticides -- to the general fund, 
which would be vulnerable to cutbacks during budget squeezes. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 135 also would keep responsibility for pesticide safety largely 
within the state Department of Food and Agriculture, which traditionally has 
defended pesticide use. The department would distribute $25 million set aside 
by the initiative for studies to find alternatives to dangerous pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128, on the other hand, would transfer responsibility for testing 
to the Department of Health Services and give the environmental advocate 
responsibility for distributing $20 million in competitive grants for research 
into alternatives to the pesticides being phased out. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 135 said they have raised $2 million toward a 
$5-million goal, with about 80% earmarked for television and radio advertising. 
Vice said the campaign has returned donations sent by chemical interests to 
ensure that voters will identify the initiative with farmers instead of 
pesticide makers.

SANTA PAULA SCHOOLS BATTLE IMAGE ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: PARENTS BLAME AN ENROLLMENT EXODUS ON LOW TEST SCORES AND REPORTS OF 
GANGS. EDUCATORS SAY THE CRITICISM IS UNDESERVED.

<P>
Santa Paula's 1950s-style neighborhood schools have vanished, and with them, 
some of the students, parents and real estate brokers say. 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Paula Elementary School District, the city's largest, enrollment 
fell 4% over a two-year period, according to district records. Today 3,164 
students attend seven elementary and middle schools, compared with 3,290 three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
During the early part of the decade, Santa Paula schools filled with students 
as enrollment increased nearly 1.8% a year. 
</P>
<P>
Parents blame the exodus on low test scores, poor academic standards and 
reports of gangs in the town's only middle school. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had people move to Camarillo to avoid the schools," said Roylene 
Cunningham, a parent and chairwoman of a school advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
School officials say the public schools' bad image is undeserved. They blame 
slow municipal growth and an aging population for a smaller pool of students. 
</P>
<P>
"There are parents in this community who are saying the schools are unfit," 
school board President Janet Grant said. "But I don't think that Santa Paula 
schools deserve the reputation that they have." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula Elementary School District Supt. Dave Philips has called for a 
study on why students are leaving. 
</P>
<P>
The district has tried to improve instruction by offering classes for gifted 
Spanish-speaking students, as well as special literature and reading courses 
for both English and Spanish speakers to help them learn in a bilingual 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
So far enrollment appears to be rising slightly compared with last year, but 
officials fear further declines. 
</P>
<P>
Falling enrollment would "affect personnel and mean reductions," Philips said. 
"It makes things a little tighter." 
</P>
<P>
Officials are restricting transfers to other Santa Paula school districts, a 
move they say will keep a desegregation program intact. Elementary students 
attend four districts in Santa Paula, including Santa Paula, Briggs, Mupu and 
Santa Clara school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in enrollment has caused budget cuts, since state financing is 
based on the number of students enrolled in the district. Over the past two 
years, the district has lost about $437,000 in state money. Nine teachers were 
laid off in July. 
</P>
<P>
The exodus of students has also hurt the city, Santa Paula Mayor Kay Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a real estate agent, said the decline has affected businesses and Santa 
Paula's image as a good place to live. 
</P>
<P>
Out-of-town buyers query real estate agents carefully, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We get asked two questions: 'Are your schools really as bad as we've heard?' 
And 'How far is it to private school?' " Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
She said some buyers purchase residences in Santa Paula for its serene rural 
environment, only to send their children to schools in Ventura and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
One of those out-of-town buyers was Christine Quitmeyer, 35, a part-time 
accountant at a dental office. For her, the Santa Paula elementary school 
system was a lesson in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Quitmeyer moved from Las Cruces, N.M., to Ventura County in 
search of a quiet, rural atmosphere to raise her son, David. She settled on 
Santa Paula after being impressed by the town's quaint tree-lined streets. 
</P>
<P>
But after her son attended eighth grade at Isbell Middle School, Quitmeyer's 
opinion changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids would say they were in a different gang and could not play together. Half 
the kids couldn't speak English," Quitmeyer said. She enrolled David in a 
private Christian school. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of non-English-speaking pupils is one reason Santa Paula students 
have tested substantially lower in reading, writing and math than their peers 
in other school districts, school officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos make up 72% of the elementary students in Santa Paula schools. Whites 
make up less than 16% of the students. 
</P>
<P>
Former school board member Bob Borrego, now a candidate for the Santa Paula 
City Council, said test scores have always been low, because many students come 
from poor farm worker and immigrant families and have limited education. 
</P>
<P>
The school district has the second-highest concentration of migrant students in 
the county. Fillmore has the largest. 
</P>
<P>
"As far back as I can remember, people in the administration have been 
lamenting low test scores," Borrego said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988-89, the last year for which figures were available, reading scores 
dipped for the three grades tested under the California Assessment Program 
compared with the previous year. Math scores also dipped for two grades the 
same year. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first decline for third-graders, whose reading scores had improved 
slightly in previous years. For sixth- and eighth-graders, it was the second 
time in four years that scores had dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Past test scores had placed Santa Paula pupils in the lowest 2% in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Scores in 1988-89 were affected by a major shake-up that changed boundaries and 
transfers that involved 52% of the teaching staff, Philips said. 
</P>
<P>
Aging school buildings, staff turnover and limited resources have brought 
scores down in past years, Borrego said. He sat on a school board committee 
that recommended changes that led to the many bitter complaints parents have 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, neighborhood schools where students had attended up to the third 
grade were changed to kindergarten through fifth grade. A separate middle 
school at Isbell was created to handle sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
The district also imposed a voluntary desegregation program that created magnet 
schools that offered special academic programs, such as computer and science, 
open classrooms and bilingual programs. 
</P>
<P>
Magnet schools were supposed to help the district integrate schools by offering 
special academic programs at schools where Spanish-speaking students made up 
the majority. But it also angered parents. 
</P>
<P>
"They look at the magnet schools as their great white hope," said Karen 
Cottingham, 31, a parent and former president of the parent-teacher club at 
Glen City School. "But I don't see people coming from across town to come to 
Glen City to learn Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
Parents say Isbell Middle School is plagued by rumors of gangs, fights and poor 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
One Latino father, who asked not to be identified, said he preferred to have 
his sixth-grade daughter go to St. Sebastian Catholic School rather than attend 
Isbell. 
</P>
<P>
"She was sort of afraid to go there because of the little stories that get out 
about gang-related situations that had happened in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Isbell teachers, the father said he was disappointed that 
his daughter would have had to repeat material she had already learned. 
</P>
<P>
Quitmeyer said she had the same complaint about the classes her son took at 
Isbell. 
</P>
<P>
"What they learned in seventh grade in New Mexico, they learned in eighth grade 
here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Philips attributed some of the complaints to overambitious parents who 
want their children to learn advanced material beyond their grade level. "There 
are certain reasons where you might want to practice a skill a parent may see 
as repetitive." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from three minor scuffles at Isbell, there has been none of the violence 
rumored about the school, Philips said. This year, enrollment has climbed by 41 
students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Metelak, whose child attended private school for two years before 
transferring to Isbell school, agreed with Philips' assessment. She said she 
initially objected to sending her daughter to Isbell, where she was concerned 
that her daughter would encounter gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been totally the opposite. She fits in very well and socially has no 
problems. I talked to parents who have their kids in Ventura schools, and they 
have the same problems we have." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her criticism of the school system, Cunningham said her three children 
have done well in the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like that's the real world," she said. "My husband went to a Catholic 
school. I think he agrees with me that if our kids are going to get along in 
this world, they need to live in this world."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL APPROVES NEW CITY POLICY ON 
AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee Monday approved a proposed new AIDS policy 
that officials say is the most comprehensive urban blueprint in the nation for 
dealing with the fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-page document was approved by the Arts, Health and Humanities Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Two other committees must review sections of the document before it can be sent 
to the full City Council for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
The policy guarantees city workers infected with acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome the right to confidentiality and bars city employees from refusing to 
work with others who have AIDS, or the human immunodeficiency virus that 
triggers AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The policy also formalizes existing city AIDS programs, including the 
distribution of AIDS prevention kits, which contain condoms and printed 
information about the disease.

NAUSEATING ODOR SENDS 3 TO HOSPITAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Owners and employees of a beauty salon, pet store and four other Thousand Oaks 
shops were evacuated for about two hours Monday after a noxious odor sent two 
beauticians and an infant to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Workers on the northwest corner of Janss Mall at Hillcrest Drive and Moorpark 
Road said a nauseating odor has disrupted their businesses for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
Bertha Whitemore, Peggy Varnes and Varnes' 6-month-old baby were treated and 
released at Los Robles Regional Medical Center after they reported nausea, 
dizziness and difficulty breathing. 
</P>
<P>
But the Ventura County Fire Department and Ventura County Environmental Health 
Department could detect no odor and no source of one Monday, said Dean Dysart, 
captain of the Fire Department's hazardous materials unit. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that any vapor could have evaporated by about 1 p.m., when 
environmental health workers inspected the property, or by 3 p.m., when Fire 
Department crews arrived, Dysart said. 
</P>
<P>
Dysart said he ruled out a nearby dry-cleaning plant as the source of the odor. 
</P>
<P>
Perchloroethylene, a dry-cleaning fluid that produces an ether-like smell and 
the only one used by Village Cleaners, should not be hazardous if it is used 
correctly, Dysart said. 
</P>
<P>
The business appeared to be in compliance, he said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

CANDIDATE SAYS BAD TURF TO CLOSE PARK

<P>
A candidate for Moorpark mayor claimed Monday that the city's most frequently 
used park will be closed for four months so that tougher turf can be planted, 
but city officials said no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Wheeler, a former city parks and recreation commissioner, held a press 
conference at Peach Hill Park, where lighted diamonds allow adult softball 
teams to play at night and where youth soccer teams practice in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
He said replanting the park's turf will cost $30,000 to $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
About two years ago, ball fields were planted with a type of grass that doesn't 
stand up to the heavy use at the park, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and other commission members "identified the problem from Day 1 when 
the park was dedicated. . . . Nothing has been done. There has been no real 
action on behalf of the council to address this situation. This is a case where 
no decision eventually equals a decision." 
</P>
<P>
However, City Manager Steve Kueny said there has been no decision to close the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler also charged that the city would lose an additional $3,000 in fees from 
adult softball teams with closure of the park. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

NEIGHBORS ENLISTED TO STOP ATTACKS ON COUPLE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SINCE JUNE, KAREN AND JAY LY HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF VANDALISM AND 
VIOLENCE THAT APPEAR TO BE RACIALLY MOTIVATED.

<P>
Ten volunteers from the Valley Interfaith Council went door-to-door Monday 
night to enlist the help of neighbors of a Northridge family victimized by a 
series of apparently racially motivated crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just pathetic that these things are going on," said Juanita DeSosa of the 
Interfaith Council. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, someone has spray-painted racial slurs on Karen and Jay Ly's house 
and cars, made annoying phone calls and thrown rocks through their windows, 
according to Los Angeles police. Karen Ly also said she has twice been attacked 
by young men who threatened her with more violence if she continued to report 
the crimes to police. 
</P>
<P>
The Lys moved into a quiet neighborhood of single-family homes about 12 years 
ago and say they never had any problems until the attacks began in June. She is 
Jewish and he is Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
News of the racial incidents came as a surprise to many of the Lys' neighbors, 
DeSosa said. "The people weren't aware of what had been going on. . . . They 
were happy to be informed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't like the idea of these crimes being perpetuated in this day and 
age. Everybody needs to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
No suspects have been identified in the case, Detective Wayne Newton said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of Monday's canvass of the neighborhood said they hoped it will 
encourage residents to report suspicious activity around the Ly house. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a friendly action to show support for the victim," said Shirley Gillett 
of the council's human relations committee. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers covered a five-block area, gathering more than 50 signatures on 
a petition asking the Los Angeles Police Department to take action to end 
racially motivated crimes. 
</P>
<P>
After canvassing the neighborhood, the group held a meeting at the Ly home that 
was attended by the president of the Valley chapter of the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People, local police officers and about 75 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
In June, annoying phone calls kept the Lys' phone ringing every night. A short 
time later, spray-painted swastikas appeared on the side of the Ly home. Karen 
Ly said her toe was broken when she was attacked by men she caught in a back 
yard shed. In another attack, she said, she was hit in the back with a board 
and told to stop calling police. More recently, the interior of the Ly house 
was ransacked and covered with spray-painted racial epithets. 
</P>
<P>
Newton said the attacks have become more frequent in the last six weeks after a 
brief lull. He said he hopes Monday's action will help identify a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"Now's the time to work together to see if we can't stop this," he said.

BRADLEY SAYS COUNCIL'S RESTRICTIONS ON MOSQUE ARE OUTRAGEOUS; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: THE MAYOR'S SUPPORT FUELS MUSLIMS' HOPES THAT A DOME AND MINARET 
CAN BE ADDED TO THE NORTHRIDGE BUILDING'S DESIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley on Monday strongly criticized the City Council for requiring 
that a proposed mosque in Granada Hills be cloaked in Spanish-style 
architecture, calling the requirement "outrageous" and "an affront to religious 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's statement encouraged the head of the mosque's congregation to hope 
that the city will relent and grant permission to add "a small dome and 
minaret" to the proposed structure on a 2.5-acre site near Rinaldi Street and 
Encino Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, traveling in Germany on a trade mission, said in a press release and 
letter released Monday that he wanted his Cultural Affairs Commission to hold a 
hearing within 45 days that "will lead to development of a city policy 
regarding the design of religious buildings." 
</P>
<P>
A construction permit for the mosque had been opposed by some neighboring 
homeowners. The conditional use permit approved by the City Council last week 
includes a condition that the final design for the mosque conform substantially 
to drawings depicting a Spanish-style building with stucco walls and a red tile 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
The council requirement "displays a lack of understanding of the connection 
between worship and the architecture and design properties of houses of 
worship," Bradley said. "This affront to religious freedom cannot be condoned." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it will help us that the mayor's taking an interest," said Mohammed 
Mohuiddin, president of the Islamic Center of Northridge, who heads the Muslim 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
With the mayor's support, Mohuiddin said, perhaps the congregation can obtain 
city permission to add "a small dome and minaret" to the building. "It would 
make us feel good to have it look like a mosque, not like a warehouse." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said however that the mayor was "not sure he has any 
legal force to change" the design limits. 
</P>
<P>
"We are primarily looking to the future," Fabiani said. He described the mayor 
as "very troubled" by the implications of the council's action. "If you tell a 
mosque what to look like, then you can tell a Jewish temple or a Catholic 
Church. It's a really slippery slope." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents Granada Hills, could not be reached for 
comment. His press deputy said he was out of town but would return today. 
Bernson originally had opposed the mosque but later assured local homeowner 
foes that the Muslims would be good neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The Granada Hills edifice, costing $1.8 million and set to be completed in a 
year, would be the San Fernando Valley's first mosque, Mohuiddin said. The 
Valley is home to a growing number of Muslims, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The origin of the mosque's Spanish-style design was not clear. 
</P>
<P>
Mohuiddin said it was his recollection that the Spanish style was imposed by 
the area's Citizens Advisory Committee. These committees, picked by Bernson, 
are widely believed to reflect his views. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't really protest at the time" about the design, Mohuiddin said. "We 
were really desperate for a place to worship." 
</P>
<P>
But ex-Councilman Robert Wilkinson, the Islamic Center's City Hall lobbyist, 
said he recommended that the congregation adopt the Spanish style to avoid a 
confrontation with the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I advised them to make it blend in with the community," Wilkinson said. "I 
told them not to be different." 
</P>
<P>
The lobbyist said his advice was based on the Muslims' experience when they 
"tested the waters" for building a mosque with domes and minarets in a 
neighborhood near Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"The community came unglued," Wilkinson said. "They were objecting to the way 
it looked." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson also said that, if Bradley was concerned about hardships imposed by 
City Hall on the Muslims, the mayor "should not be pointing the finger at the 
council or the zoning administrator" but at his own Board of Zoning Appeals 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"The restriction that really hurt was on the size of the congregation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The board, whose five members are Bradley appointees, recommended limiting the 
congregation to 250 worshipers, 300 fewer than the Muslims had originally 
sought and 50 fewer than the city's zoning administrator had recommended. The 
250-worshiper limit also was approved by the City Council. After a year, this 
limit can be raised to a maximum of 400, with the approval of a city planning 
official.

<P>
The board of directors of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has approved 
an $80,000 grant that will enable thousands of Oxnard schoolchildren to learn 
about the natural resources of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Under the pilot program, which will begin in October, school buses will pick up 
the students at their schools in Oxnard and transport them to the mountains, 
where they will be met by conservancy naturalists, said Amy Lethbridge, 
director of the Mountains Conservancy Foundation's Education and Recreation 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
The naturalists will lead the students on two-hour educational hikes to 
introduce them to wildlife and nature, Lethbridge said. Conservancy officials 
hope to begin the program in October and serve more than 7,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard program will be modeled after a similar conservancy program in Los 
Angeles County designed for children from disadvantaged areas of Los Angeles, 
Lethbridge said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Brekke, superintendent of the Oxnard Elementary School District, said 
the program may substitute for a districtwide outdoor science program that was 
phased out in recent years because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Lethbridge said Oxnard was selected because of the large number of minority 
students, whom the program aims specifically to help, and because of its 
proximity to the Santa Monica Mountains. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

CITY ATTORNEY URGES DISCLOSURE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig has recommended that secret reports and memos 
from his office to the City Council be released to the public only with the 
approval of four of the five council members. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which was made in a report to the council, will be considered by 
the council during its regular meeting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gillig's recommendation was prompted by criticism from Councilwoman Ann Johs, 
who said earlier this month that the city attorney's office generates too many 
secret memos. 
</P>
<P>
The city has never had a formal disclosure policy, but Gillig said the 
unofficial policy has been to require that four members approve the release of 
such documents. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a previous interview, Johs said she believes the policy is too 
restrictive. "I think it stinks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In his report, Gillig said his office submitted 148 confidential reports to the 
council, of which 134 related directly to claims against the city, court cases, 
potential litigation and personnel issues. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 14 reports and memos concerned "items of interest to the City 
Council and contained legal opinions of the city attorney with 
recommendations," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In his 8 1/2-page report, Gillig discussed at length the question of whether he 
represents the entire council, a majority of the council or each individual 
council member. 
</P>
<P>
Although he concluded that the council as a collective body is his client, he 
decided against requiring a unanimous vote of the council to release secret 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
In summary, he said, there is no legal precedent to help him draft a disclosure 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"A compromise between the above proposals would be for City Council to adopt a 
policy which requires four votes for disclosure, but there is nothing magical 
about that number either," he said in the report. HUGO MARTIN

ELVIRA (VEDA) YOUNG; RETIRED HAT DESIGNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elvira (Veda) Young, a longtime Sherman Oaks resident and retired hat designer, 
has died in Sherman Oaks. She was 95. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Young died Sept. 11 of natural causes, her daughter, Margo Mitchell, said. 
</P>
<P>
She was born Elvira Bernasconi on Sept. 4, 1895, in Lugano, Switzerland. Her 
family moved to Buenos Aires, where she was raised. She came to the United 
States in 1930 and began making hats New York City. In the late 1930s, she 
opened her own business, Neysette, which specialized in creating elaborate 
turbans and picture hats for performers. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, she closed the store and moved to Los Angeles and then to 
Sherman Oaks in 1966. She played poker with a group of women called the 
Saturday Night Poker Girls and painted with oils for about a decade until the 
late 1970s when her eyesight deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her daughter of Sherman Oaks; a granddaughter, 
great-grandson and great-granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled at 2 p.m. Sept. 29 at Praiswater &amp; Sons 
funeral home, 5849 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys, which is handling the 
arrangements. Donations can be made in Mrs. Young's name to the American Heart 
Assn., San Fernando Valley chapter.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 MEN PLEAD GUILTY IN KICKBACK SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Northridge men who were purchasing agents for aerospace companies pleaded 
guilty Monday to charges of tax fraud for failing to report kickbacks they 
received from a subcontractor, thS. attorney's office announced. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Fisher, 67, a purchasing agent for Eaton Corp., and Frank Brown, 56, 
who worked for Cetec Corp. and Hamilton-Avnet, each received kickbacks from 
now-defunct Dunham Corp., which made components for defense and aerospace 
projects, the U. S. attorney's office said in announcing the charges two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher received $40,000 in kickbacks for directing business to Dunham in 1984 
and 1985, and Brown received $10,000, Assistant U. S. Atty. William F. Fahey 
said. In addition, both men were charged with not reporting the income on their 
tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing for Fisher and Brown is scheduled for Nov. 6 and Nov. 26, 
respectively. Fisher faces a maximum sentence of six years in prison and a 
$200,000 fine, while Brown faces a maximum prison term of five years and a fine 
of up to $100,000, Fahey said. 
</P>
<P>
The schemes were two of the largest uncovered thus far by DEFCON, the Defense 
Contractor Task Force, created to eliminate kickbacks in Southern California's 
defense industry, Fahey said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRANSIENT FOUND SHOT IN ALLEY IN VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 45-year-old transient was in extremely critical condition Monday after he was 
found shot several times in a Van Nuys alley known as a drug trafficking area, 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's name was not released pending notification of his family. 
</P>
<P>
Detective James Vojtecky said the man was found at 12:45 a.m. in an alley 
behind the 6600 block of Hayvenhurst Avenue. Patrol officers found the victim 
after several residents in the area called police and reported hearing numerous 
gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
"No motive has been established for the shooting. However, the area is known as 
a location where narcotics transactions occur," Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a man was shot to death in the same alley during a drug deal, 
Vojtecky said.

AUTHENTICITY: Mexican author and political commentator Carlos Fuentes, above, 
has chosen San Juan Capistrano for filming of "The Buried Mirror," a five-part 
public TV series on the 500 years of Spanish influence in the Americas. . . . 
Fuentes picked Mission San Juan Capistrano because he wanted an "authentic" 
backdrop, "something that had the Spanish legacy in it," said a program 
spokeswoman. The mission was founded by the Spanish in 1776. Catherine Gewertz

CITIES SOFTEN THEIR UNDERCOUNT CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
CENSUS: LOS ANGELES AND OTHER METROPOLITAN AREAS, HOWEVER, STILL CONTEND THAT 
THERE ARE SERIOUS ERRORS. ORANGE COUNTY HAS RAISED NO CHALLENGES.

After complaining that preliminary 1990 census figures grossly underestimated 
the growth of their populations over the past decade, officials in many big 
cities -- including Los Angeles -- say that census counts may not be quite as 
far off as the critics originally alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, officials in Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and other 
metropolitan areas continue to say that there were serious errors in the Census 
Bureau's population count, which could cost local governments seats in Congress 
and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
In an official challenge forwarded to Washington late Monday, Los Angeles 
officials said they had turned up 49,513 more dwellings than the 1.3 million 
units counted by the Census Bureau. While that difference of 3.8% could 
translate into thousands of people and millions of dollars in government aid, 
the figure is well below the 10% housing underestimate Los Angeles officials 
had originally predicted. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, the Census Bureau has put the city's 1990 population at 3.42 
million -- 15% above the 1980 level. But the challenge over housing units, when 
translated into residents, could bring that figure up by 123,783 -- a total 
about equal to the population of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of missing anyone who resides in the Los Angeles area can have 
a devastating impact on the federal funds we may receive to provide needed city 
services," Mayor Tom Bradley said from Frankfurt, West Germany, while on a 
mission to promote tourism. 
</P>
<P>
During the remainder of this week, cities and towns across the country will be 
scurrying to complete formal responses to the initial census figures. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, no governmental agency has so far challenged any of the 
preliminary census counts. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1980 census, Santa Ana officials complained that upwards of 50,000 
residents -- most of them Latino newcomers living in the shadows of society -- 
were left uncounted. But the city launched a massive effort to encourage 
residents to cooperate with the census, and officials say the 1990 count 
practically exceeded their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
William Bellamy, U.S. Bureau of the Census district director in Orange County, 
said other large cities in Orange County also have appeared satisfied with the 
Census Bureau's preliminary counts. The only city in Orange County that has 
indicated it was taking a hard, second look at the preliminary figures is 
Westminster, but no challenge has yet been mounted by that city, Bellamy said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of last week the Census Bureau had received formal responses from 
4,341, or 11%, of all local governments, but not all have formally challenged 
the census numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've actually received a lot of letters here accepting our counts, telling us 
we were right in the ball park," said Denise Smith, an official in the Census 
Bureau's regional office that covers all of New England and Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
In Houston, a week before the deadline, officials were finding the local review 
of housing units much closer to the census count than they had expected. 
Nonetheless, city officials were challenging the Census Bureau's contention 
that Houston has 1.61 million residents and essentially has not grown since 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, officials were disturbed but not surprised by the census 
conclusion that population has eroded over the past decade, with city dwellers 
fleeing in ever-larger numbers to the suburbs. While officials there thought 
the census count was off, they also acknowledged that their numbers were not as 
different as they had thought. Based on earlier estimates, city officials said 
the census had overlooked as many as 97,000 dwellings. In fact, the post-census 
review of building permits and other records showed that the census undercount 
was closer to 67,000 units, said Barbara J. Kaplan, executive director of the 
city Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In a few places, officials continued to say the numbers would be as bad -- and 
in some cases, worse -- than anticipated. In Chicago, a week before the 
deadline, the difference between the census count and the local review was 
"large and growing larger," said Susan Weed, a community development 
demographer. 
</P>
<P>
New York's deadline is also later this week, but officials there continued to 
be outspoken in their criticism of the preliminary census count of 600,000 
fewer residents than the city had a decade ago -- a situation that officials 
say is preposterous, given their large homeless population and the city's 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in Washington last week, Barbara Everitt Bryant, the director of 
the Census Bureau, responded sharply to the New York officials in her first 
public statement since the agency released the preliminary 1990 counts last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
If New York's population did not drop, she said at the hearing, "Why did the 
school enrollment drop by 54,000? Why do the moving vans show more people going 
out than coming in?" 
</P>
<P>
The bureau has until mid-October to assess the challenges, at which time it 
will begin preparing a final gross count of the population, due on the 
President's desk by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
While these operations and last-minute efforts are under way to correct the 
preliminary census count of 245.8 million, census statisticians will be 
evaluating what is known as the post-enumeration survey, a statistical survey 
analyzing how well the regular census did in finding such hard-to-count 
residents as immigrants and inner-city residents. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, New York and other cities and states, along with civic and civil 
rights groups, filed a lawsuit after the 1980 census seeking to force a 
statistical correction of the 1990 census based on this study. Although the 
lawsuit is pending, the commerce department did agree to conduct the study to 
make an adjustment possible, if the Secretary of Commerce decides it is 
necessary.

The expanded John Wayne Airport was functioning nearly flawlessly Monday as the 
first horde of business travelers swarmed in and out of the long, sleek 
terminal with a minimum of fuss. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are going amazingly well, considering," said Continental Airlines 
ticket agent Pam McPhall, who was setting up a new lost-and-found office for 
the airline. "I'm surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials faced a few minor glitches on the second day of operations -- 
one balky baggage ramp, a few magnetized security badges that failed to open 
doors -- but the most serious problems seemed to have been licked. 
</P>
<P>
Computerized boards that were not displaying the gate numbers of arriving 
planes on Sunday were flashing correct information by 8 a.m. Monday. Incoming 
planes were on time, and by 9:30 a.m., only one arriving passenger had reported 
a baggage problem -- his luggage cart had not arrived with his bag. 
</P>
<P>
Although several travelers said they had left home early in case of chaos at 
the new airport, traffic was sparse. Parking spaces were abundant, and the curb 
stretched far enough for every car to pull over while dropping off departing 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's elbow room!" reported John Akins of Laguna Niguel, one of about 20,000 
passengers expected to use the airport each Monday. "It's delightful, 
absolutely delightful." 
</P>
<P>
Although it was rush hour, Akins stood nearly alone under the arching ceiling 
while the rosy morning light filled the cathedral skylights. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just thinking, how long before it fills up?" Akins said wistfully. 
"Because it's bigger than you need right now, but it won't stay that way." 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite an improvement -- as long as it doesn't bring too many more people 
into Orange County," agreed Bob Clifton of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
However, bringing more people in -- and out -- is precisely the idea behind the 
$63-million Thomas F. Riley terminal, which officially opened on Sunday. Twelve 
times the size of the old terminal, it will be capable of handling up to 160 
flights a day within two years, double the current capacity. And it will 
accommodate up to 8.4 million passengers, compared with 4.5 million at the old 
Eddie Martin Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Aesthetically, travelers were unanimous Monday in declaring the terminal an 
unqualified success. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gorgeous! It's gorgeous!" said Howard Schwartz of San Clemente. " 'Course 
there was something nice about the old terminal. It was like a small town." 
</P>
<P>
Blame the early hour, perhaps, but a few people stumbled through the terminal 
missing signs and scouting for maps. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left home last weekend, this wasn't here, so I'm a little confused 
about where I should be," said Faith Ackley of Tustin as she got off a plane 
from Oakland and had to follow the signs to find her way out. "I'm not sure 
where I am, and you used to know where you were at all times in (the old) John 
Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea where I am but this is beautiful," declared Adele La Sala of 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Several travelers, however, wondered whether they were paying for the new 
terminal in the form of higher air fares. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful airport, but I think the rates into here are outrageous 
compared to Burbank and Ontario," said Jim Watterson, a Bay Area-based 
salesman, as he searched for the hotel limousine that was to pick him up. 
</P>
<P>
Watterson said he paid $150 for a round-trip ticket from Oakland to Ontario 
last week, but $356 for Monday's round-trip flight from Oakland to John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll go back to Ontario," Watterson said.

<P>
NEWPORT BLVD. TO BE REDUCED TO 1 LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning this week, Caltrans will reduce southbound traffic on Newport 
Boulevard to one lane between 19th and 22nd streets, and to two lanes between 
22nd and Fair Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The lane reduction is expected to last until early 1991 to allow Caltrans to 
work on an extension to the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is asking drivers to find alternate routes during this time. 
</P>
<P>
When completed, the new freeway segment will link central Orange County and the 
beach communities. The extension also is expected to relieve congestion on 
Newport Boulevard, which now carries much of the area's beach traffic. 
</P>
<P>
During the construction, traffic will be routed west on Victoria Street, south 
on Harbor Boulevard and back to Newport Boulevard near 19th Street.

MAN FIRES SHOTS, THEN ROBS BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities are searching for a man who fired two shots into the ceiling of a 
bank before escaping with an unknown amount of cash, said Orange County 
Sheriff's Lt. Richard Olson. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the noon incident at the First Interstate Bank at 26281 
Avery Parkway. The man entered the bank, brandished a handgun and "fired a 
couple of rounds into the ceiling to get their attention," Olson said. He then 
took an undisclosed amount of money and escaped on foot, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber was described as in his early 30s; with brown hair; 5 feet, 10 
inches tall; and wearing a light-colored baseball cap, a long-sleeved white 
shirt, faded jeans and white shoes, Olson said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTS PRAISE SPIRE AT CATHEDRAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Garden Grove's already acclaimed Crystal Cathedral, newly crowned with a 
glistening 18-story stainless-steel steeple, can now be truly classified as an 
Orange County landmark, architects said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Most architecture isn't great. This project is," said architect Leason 
Pomeroy, president of the Irvine-based firm that designed the county's new 
airport terminal. "Our community needs landmark architecture." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Robert H. Schuller on Sunday dedicated the $5.5-million spire, which 
was completed over the summer and is now one of the county's tallest 
structures. New York architect Phillip Johnson, the designer of both the new 
steeple and the glass-walled church, was on hand for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Built with 9-foot reflective steel prisms, the 236-foot spire includes a 
52-bell carillon and is topped by a beacon for aircraft. It also features an 
underground chapel with a revolving crystal cross. 
</P>
<P>
"It's designed, engineered and constructed as a thing of beauty, a joy forever 
to last literally for centuries," Schuller said. The tower is also earthquake 
proof, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 84, told the congregation during the ceremony that he was surprised at 
the overall effect of his design. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so far more than I expected that it's hard even to speak about it," he 
said. "I didn't realize that what we have here, Robert, is a tower that is 
built of light. That celebrates the sun as great towers should. But in a new 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who donated his design services, went on to say that he had help in 
creating the tower. "I think you all know where that help came from." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also designed the 10-year-old cathedral, constructed of 10,000 panes of 
glass and exposed rods and pipes, and featuring 90-foot-high glass doors. The 
spire, or campanile, was part of the original plan, but wasn't built because 
Schuller's church ran out of money. 
</P>
<P>
"If Philip Johnson hadn't lived to be 84, it would never have been finished. 
He's the only person who could have finished it." 
</P>
<P>
As of last September, the church was also $2 million short of being able to pay 
for the tower. But a gift in that amount from Newport Beach philanthropists 
John and Donna Crean put the building fund over the top, sources said. The 
spire is called the Crean Tower. 
</P>
<P>
The rest came from "friends of the ministry," including $200,000 from 
philanthropist Armand Hammer and $1 million from Mary Tolerton Hood, widow of 
Clifford F. Hood, former president of U.S. Steel Corp. The still unfinished 
chapel is named for her. 
</P>
<P>
When people question the cost, Schuller said he replies that it is better to 
focus on how long the structure will last and how many people will enjoy it.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
SUIT WILL TRY TO HALT HOMELESS SWEEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for the homeless are expected to file suit against Santa Ana 
officials today in an effort to stop police from conducting sweeps at the Civic 
Center, where dozens of homeless have been arrested in recent weeks for minor 
infractions. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys at the Legal Aid Society of Orange County, as well as members of 
several prestigious law firms, said they intend to file the lawsuit in Orange 
County Superior Court. Mayor Daniel H. Young, City Manager David N. Ream and 
Police Chief Paul M. Walters are expected to be named in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned that the city will keep on repeating the sweeps," Crystal C. 
Sims, Legal Aid's director of litigation, said Monday. "If the practice is not 
stopped, we are going to see the same police activities in other cities that 
want to get rid of their homeless." 
</P>
<P>
In the complaint, an early copy of which was provided to The Times, attorneys 
charge that police sweeps at the Civic Center are part of a citywide campaign 
initiated in 1988 to "drive the homeless from the city of Santa Ana." The 
August sweeps "renewed and intensified" the campaign, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleges that the police sweeps, particularly one that took place 
on Aug. 15, violated homeless people's constitutional rights to equal 
protection and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure by the police. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said he has not seen the complaint but pointed out 
that the police were enforcing local laws that cannot be restrained by a court 
order. 
</P>
<P>
In numerous interviews, Chief Walters has said that the sweeps were aimed at 
criminals and did not target the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Santa Ana police conducted two sweeps at the Civic Center, arresting 
more than 90 people, most of them for municipal code infractions such as public 
drunkenness, littering and urinating in public. Seven people were arrested on 
outstanding warrants. Walters has said he will continue the sweeps until the 
number of crimes is lowered in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeps marked the end of an uneasy truce between the homeless and the city. 
In February, the City Council had agreed to pay 14 homeless people $50,000 for 
the confiscation and discarding of their bedrolls and other personal property 
during cleanup sweeps at city parks and the Civic Center two years ago. The 
settlement also included an agreement under which city officials said they 
would not conduct large-scale maintenance sweeps without giving notice to the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the city began seizing the possessions of homeless people during 
periodic citywide cleanups at all parks and public areas. City workers 
initially threw the items away. But after a public uproar, they began putting 
them in a dumpster at Centennial Regional Park and allowing homeless people to 
search for their belongings.

PEOPLE: GRIEF MADE TUSTIN WOMAN AN ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Years ago, when she was a homemaker, Helen Shanbrom involved herself with a 
group of other mothers in a school fracas over "what our children should and 
could read." 
</P>
<P>
They fought the PTA and the school board, and they won. 
</P>
<P>
That was as political as Shanbrom ever got until four years ago when a gravel 
truck that the California Highway Patrol said was going 65 m.p.h. crossed the 
Foothill Freeway center divider in San Dimas and killed her son, David, 27, a 
1980 graduate of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Today, in retrospect, the North Tustin woman contends, "If you feel strongly 
about something, stand up and speak out. I never used that philosophy until 
David was killed." 
</P>
<P>
So, using that thinking, Shanbrom started a crusade to promote new legislation 
to protect others against truck drivers who break the law. 
</P>
<P>
"Why am I doing this? To keep David's memory alive, so no one will forget how 
he died," and he will not be "just another statistic," she says. "He was a 
valuable human being." 
</P>
<P>
"Grief can change you completely," says Shanbrom, who has three other children 
from her 43-year marriage to retired physician Ed Shanbrom. "It just activated 
me. I felt I had to do something." 
</P>
<P>
Friends told her to forget trying, that she was only one person. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if I could do anything, but I felt I just had to try," she says. 
</P>
<P>
So for four years she turned into another person, barraging politicians with 
letters urging that laws be changed to protect innocent drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to turn on the news and not hear every day of another, and another, 
and another tractor-trailer jackknifed or overturned or burning or spilling on 
the freeways," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Since speed is consistently the major cause of truck-involved accidents where 
truck drivers are at fault, I say 'Slow down!' 
</P>
<P>
"I became a one-woman lobbyist. I learned how to work through the involved and 
complicated political system." 
</P>
<P>
Shanbrom admits, however, "I still don't understand it completely, but I know 
more than most." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) helped her by using his influence to pass 
bills raising the penalty for speeding truck drivers; increasing the number of 
spot roadside safety inspections of trucks; and launching a pilot program of 
using unmarked CHP cars for truck safety enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial truck drivers were also banned from using only hand or service 
brakes to stop their vehicles, the type of brakes used by the truck that plowed 
into her son's car. 
</P>
<P>
Part of her effort, Shanbrom adds, is to inspire others to stand up and speak 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for my husband and my other children, I gave up a lot of things to 
tighten truck safety," she says, noting that she works daily in her home to 
right what she considers a deadly wrong on the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Others harmed in truck-related traffic accidents have written to congratulate 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think I have helped, but I look at the statistics and see increases 
in traffic deaths," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Shanbrom acknowledges that the statistics might have been even higher without 
her efforts. But while she feels "somewhat successful," she says, she is "not 
successful enough." 
</P>
<P>
One of her hurts is knowing that "we live in a society that will get you off 
even if you break the law, because everyone has rights." 
</P>
<P>
But she notes that "David has no rights left. I have to speak for him."

BOXING: SOUTHLAND'S GWEN ADAIR STRIVES TO BECOME THE FIRST WOMAN TO REFEREE A 
WORLD TITLE BOUT. MANY EXPERTS SAY THAT SHE IS WELL ON HER WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There is a professional referee in Los Angeles who is a stickler for preventing 
boxers from grabbing and holding one another. 
</P>
<P>
Before each bout, the referee visits the fighters' dressing rooms and lays down 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
"I use those visits to establish a rapport with both boxers," the referee says. 
"I tell them I want them to respond to verbal commands. I tell them if they 
clinch and I yell, 'Break!' I expect them to break, immediately. I make sure 
they understand that if I have to start yanking and pulling on them, I'll take 
away points. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, one night at the Forum I was working a heavyweight bout. In the first 
round, one of the boxers, a 6-foot-4, 220-pound guy, starts holding. I yelled, 
'Break!' as loud as I could. 
</P>
<P>
"He let go of the other guy right away, looked at me and said: 'Yes, ma'am.' 
</P>
<P>
"I nearly burst out laughing." 
</P>
<P>
First, Gwen Adair was merely a fight fan. In 1976, someone gave her a plaque 
designating her "Female Fight Fan of the Year" for Los Angeles. Then she 
managed a fighter from 1976 through '78. Then she refereed a few amateur fights 
in 1978 and became a pro referee in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
She has long since lost count of how many pro bouts she has worked -- hundreds, 
not dozens -- but she and others in her nearly all-male sport believe that she 
is America's only female pro boxing referee. 
</P>
<P>
And after 11 years, she is close to achieving her dream -- to become the first 
female referee to work a world championship fight. She doesn't have one on her 
calendar yet, but she has reason to be hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry Nathanson came up to me at a commission meeting not long ago and told me 
he felt I was the most-improved referee around," she said, referring to the 
chairman of the California Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
For most of her 10 years as a California referee, Adair (formerly Gwen 
Farrell), had her critics. Some of the criticism could be attributed to male 
resentment of her intrusion into an almost exclusively male workplace. But 
there were some legitimate complaints about her work, including one that she 
seemed reluctant to work too closely to the boxers. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last year, many say, her refereeing -- she also judges fights -- has 
improved markedly. "She's a good referee, not great, but a good one," said one 
longtime Southern California trainer, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be able to still yell at her during a bout. I want her to think that 
I think she's lousy. That'll keep her on her toes, see?" 
</P>
<P>
Several prominent people in boxing support the contention that Adair is the 
sport's only female referee, at least in the United States. Randy Gordon, 
executive director of the New York State Athletic Commission, said he knows of 
no others. Burt Sugar, a boxing journalist and historian, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1940s, Belle Martell was a licensed California boxing referee, but 
soon became a wrestling promoter. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Goldman of New York, journalist-historian for Boxing Illustrated, also 
said he believes that Adair is the country's only working female referee. 
</P>
<P>
"A woman named Baby Bear James got a license to referee in Kansas City in 1978, 
but I don't think she worked long," Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
Female judges in pro boxing are a decided minority, but it is not uncommon to 
see them work bouts in California, Nevada, New York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
At a boxing show at the Forum not long ago, Adair was working an undercard bout 
when one of the boxers was suddenly hit by a hard right-hand punch. He landed 
flat on his back, and it was apparent to everyone in the building that the 
fighter would not rise. 
</P>
<P>
Adair, instead of beginning a count, was at the fallen fighter's side in an 
instant, tenderly cradling his head with her left hand and summoning the 
ringside physician with her right, indicating that the fight was over. Among 
those impressed with that performance and with her recent work in general was 
Nathanson. 
</P>
<P>
"She's better than most of our male referees," he said. "She's been improving 
gradually over the past three or four years, but her improvement just in the 
last year has been dramatic. I told the commission staff I felt she was ready 
for a title fight." 
</P>
<P>
No one will say when that will happen. There have been 13 world title fights at 
the Forum in the past 16 months, and the next figures to be the Paul 
Banke-Daniel Zaragoza World Boxing Council super-bantamweight championship bout 
Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever she gets her wish, Adair will become the most visible woman in the 
history of a sport that can be traced to the early 1700s, when Englishmen first 
pounded on each other inside rings on the fields of Wiltshire. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps she will not be as visible as she has been in her second of three 
occupations. 
</P>
<P>
As an actress, when she was Gwen Farrell, she appeared in 18 TV episodes of 
"M*A*S*H" as Nurse Gwen. She had a role in the film "The Poseidon Adventure" 
and was the barmaid at Huggy Bear's bar in the TV series "Starsky &amp; Hutch." 
She has also appeared in commercials. 
</P>
<P>
When she isn't refereeing or acting, Adair runs the Fatburger restaurant she 
has owned for the last nine years at the corner of La Cienega and Santa Monica 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Adair's mother, Lovie Yancey, started the chain in 1950 with the original 
Fatburger at 31st Street and Western Avenue in Los Angeles. Now, there are 30 
Fatburgers in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Adair's boxing years began at the Olympic Auditorium in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just a fan, for years," she said. "My family and friends went to the 
fights all the time. I got to know a lot of the fighters. Then I started 
thinking it would be fun to manage a fighter. So one of the commission guys 
introduced me to a kick-boxer, Howard Jackson, who wanted to convert to boxing. 
</P>
<P>
"I managed him from 1976 to '78. He was 15-1, then went back to kick-boxing. 
He's a bodyguard for Chuck Norris now. I enjoyed that, but it was really hard 
to find another boxer I wanted to work with. It was like looking for money 
lying on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"About then, I decided to try refereeing. I met an LAPD detective (Frank Adair, 
later her husband), who ran a gym, and I started refereeing amateur bouts. When 
I tried to move up to the pros, a lot of people tried to discourage me. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me I wouldn't be able to take the abuse, that I'd be called names. 
But I really wanted to do it, and the name-calling, I've just sort of blocked 
that out while I work. Your concentration level is pretty high when you're 
working a bout. I really don't hear much of it." 
</P>
<P>
What about the blood? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not at all queasy about blood, unless it's mine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She has more difficulty with airplanes. Her fear of flying has impeded her 
refereeing career to some extent. California and Nevada judges and referees 
travel routinely to Asia, Latin America and Europe to serve as neutral judges 
and referees, but not Adair. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a real problem with airplanes," she said. "It's not being up in the 
air, it's being inside the plane, the confinement." 
</P>
<P>
After Adair worked about 100 amateur bouts, the California Athletic Commission 
issued her first license in 1979. Then came several years of four- and 
six-rounders. And at 5 feet 5 and 125 pounds, she's not restricted to working 
flyweight bouts, either. 
</P>
<P>
"That rapport with both fighters, that I try to establish before they go in the 
ring, if I get that, it doesn't matter how big they are," she said. "All that 
matters is that they know they must respond to my verbal commands." 
</P>
<P>
If they don't, she's not exactly hesitant about taking charge. 
</P>
<P>
"One time, I had two welterweights who were punching after the bell and 
wouldn't stop," she said. "So I grabbed one of them around the waist from 
behind and spun him halfway across the ring." 
</P>
<P>
And in the same determined fashion, she awaits her next step up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
"I want that world title fight," she said, "I've earned it."

BASEBALL OWNERS HIT HARD; 
</P>
<P>
COLLUSION: 2ND RULING PUTS TAB AT $102.5 MILLION. TOTAL PAYOUT TO PLAYERS COULD 
BE $300 MILLION.

<P>
Baseball owners were ordered Monday to pay players $102.5 million as 
compensation for damages caused during the 1987 and 1988 seasons, when the 
teams conspired to sign few or no free agents. 
</P>
<P>
Arbitrator George Nicolau issued the decision after 3 1/2 years of hearings, 
but did not detail how much money would go to each player, ruling only on the 
total amount of damages. Further hearings will decide how the money is divided. 
</P>
<P>
The latest ruling joins the $10.5 million awarded to players last year for the 
1986 season by arbitrator Thomas Roberts, who heard the first of the three 
collusion cases. The total of approximately $113 million comes to about $4.4 
million per team, and that does not include interest, which will total tens of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck O'Connor, head of management's Player Relations Committee, said the union 
had asked for approximately $130 million for 1987 and 1988 and that owners had 
proposed damages of about $85 million. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolau, who heard the second two cases, did not wish to comment on his ruling. 
He gave copies to the union and the PRC, and union head Donald Fehr said he 
would release the text of the decision Tuesday, when he will hold a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be much more to come when the remaining damages are determined, 
including lost salary for 1989 and 1990, and other damages," Fehr said. 
"Protest as they will, the owners can no longer downplay either the 
significance or the effect of their intentionally wrongful conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said hearings would begin next week in Chicago on additional damages, such 
as compensation for loss of mobility. He said additional damages could be 
substantial. O'Connor termed these "issues of a relatively minor nature." 
</P>
<P>
The two arbitrators found owners guilty of suppressing salaries through a 
boycott of free agents after the 1985, 1986 and 1987 seasons. Although teams 
once again started signing free agents freely after the 1988 season, the union 
claims that damages are continuing because salaries are lower than they would 
have been without the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Clubs already have placed $10.5 million in escrow to cover the Roberts 
decision. O'Connor said $102.5 million would be added to the account by the end 
of the year and said the clubs still had approximately $100 million left from 
television money they had saved in their lockout fund last winter. 
</P>
<P>
"While we disagree with the amount of damages awarded, it is important to 
remember that the events in question began more than five years ago," O'Connor 
said. "It is undoubtedly the case that the origins of this dispute are in part 
related to the clubs' efforts to grapple with the serious economic issues 
facing the game." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Reich, an agent who represents Jack Clark, said he thought teams would be 
required to pay $10 million each by the time the litigation is finished. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be in the neighborhood of $300 million, including all of the 
damages and interest." Reich said. "That in my mind is not much more than half 
of what I felt the actual damages to players were." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Moss, an agent who represents players Andre Dawson and Jack Morris, 
both collusion victims, complained of the time it is taking for players to get 
the damages. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, the only people who have seen any money are the lawyers and the 
arbitrators," he said.

</P>
<P>
GILL BYRD: CHARGERS CORNERBACK TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR LETDOWNS THAT LED TO 
TWO BENGAL TOUCHDOWNS SUNDAY. BUT HIS THOUGHTS WERE WITH HIS 6-YEAR-OLD SON, 
GILL JR., WHO IS BATTLING A MYSTERIOUS ILLNESS.

<P>
There were no excuses, not the slightest hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
Gill Byrd was to blame for letting Cincinnati score two of its three touchdowns 
in a 21-16 win Sunday, and Gill Byrd said so. 
</P>
<P>
It's what the Charger cornerback did not say, however, that explains so much. 
</P>
<P>
Since Friday a very sick 6-year-old Gill, Jr., has been in Children's Hospital 
undergoing tests and confounding physicians as to just what might be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's son continues to be treated for a temperature that has topped out at 105 
degrees. He's also suffering from a rash and pain in his joints that does not 
always allow him to walk. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating. We don't know what's going on," Byrd said. "The doctors are 
dumbfounded. They said he might be able to come home now, but then they still 
have no idea what's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear all sorts of possibilities. We heard about Lyme disease, and so they 
tested him for Lyme disease Sunday. But no one knows, and the worst always runs 
through your mind. What if it's life-threatening?" 
</P>
<P>
There is character, however, at work here. Gill, Jr., the older of Byrd's two 
sons, was delivered prematurely, weighing 1 pound 15 ounces at birth. For the 
first three months of his life, the hospital remained his home. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely a miracle," Byrd said. "The Lord spared him back in 1984, and 
the time we have with him is so special. But he's been through so much, and 
every time he hurts, we hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a little champ, and he's endured all the poking they are doing. As the 
days go on they think of more tests and want more blood," he said. "His eyes 
tear up when they come with the needles, but he's done everything they have 
asked." 
</P>
<P>
Although distracted by his son's illness, Byrd has been going about the 
business of doing everything the coaches have asked. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday it was not enough. In the second quarter, his concern as a parent 
took his mind elsewhere, and so James Brooks was left all alone in the end zone 
to catch a 10-yard touchdown pass from Boomer Esiason. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, he was a step short in keeping Eddie Brown from making a 
30-yard touchdown reception. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't played that badly since high school," Byrd said. "And I don't think I 
played that badly in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"At halftime Coach (Ron) Lynn told me I wasn't in it, and what's going on? I 
said my mind was at the hospital, and I wasn't concentrating. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Do you just want to sit out the second half?' I said, 'Maybe that 
would be a good idea.' But he said, 'No, go in and play the first series and 
see how things go.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Byrd picked off an errant Esiason pass, and as a result, 
became the team's second all-time leader in career interceptions with 26. The 
shining moment, though, was lost on Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
"I was directly responsible for all 14 points in the first half," Byrd told 
reporters after the game. "I feel like I let everybody down today." 
</P>
<P>
No mention of the burden he was carrying. No hiding. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there for the team and hoping I could do something good," Byrd said. "I 
didn't mention my son because the people who pay to come to the game pay to see 
a professional do a job in a professional manner. They aren't interested in 
excuses." 
</P>
<P>
But those who know, knew better. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously he was distracted by his son's situation," said Lynn, the team's 
defensive coordinator. "He wouldn't use it as an excuse because he's a pro. But 
there were a number of things he did, or didn't do, that wouldn't happen again 
in 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
Caught between the hospital and the playing field, Byrd tried to make the most 
of it. He was voted the team's most inspirational player in each of the last 
two seasons by teammates, and he was there for them Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's amazing; he didn't want to let anybody down," secondary coach Jim Mora 
said. "I wouldn't have blamed him if he didn't even play in the game. He had 
kept it all to himself. I didn't even know about little Gill being so sick 
until a half hour before Sunday's game." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't know that little Gill had first become ill the Wednesday before the 
regular-season opener in Dallas, but maybe they should have guessed something 
was wrong when Byrd was beaten by the Cowboys' Dennis McKinnon for a 28-yard 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The touchdown in Dallas, and the passes against Cincinnati -- he makes those 
plays and they are interceptions if he's focused," Mora said. "But he's not 
human if he's not distracted." 
</P>
<P>
Before Gill Jr. was admitted to the hospital for observation on Friday, mother 
and father were up nightly administering cold baths to reduce his temperature. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be so tired after practice and I couldn't always get up in the middle of 
the night," Byrd said. "My wife's exhausted, and I feel so sorry for her 
because I can't do anything. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fine line I'm walking. I want to stay rested and alert to practice and 
play effectively, and by the same token I've got to take some time off for my 
wife so she doesn't have the whole burden. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two boys. One's sick and the other (Jairus, 3) wakes up full of energy 
and ready to go every day." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd was on the telephone with Gill Jr. after Monday's practice at San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium, and he was on his way to the hospital after examining 
videotape of Sunday's loss to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
If the youngster remains in the hospital today, then Byrd will spend his 
off-day at his side. 
</P>
<P>
"I know everything that happens in my life, happens for a reason," Byrd said. 
"I'm a Christian, and I know nothing happens in my life until it's first 
filtered through God's hands." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd will return to work Wednesday to prepare for Sunday's game in Cleveland. 
And while strong in faith, he said he understands the task ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a lot better now; the hospitalization just brought everything to a zenith 
this weekend," he said. "But I want to stand and be accountable to my 
teammates. I know I've got to play better, and overcome this." 
</P>
<P>
Those close to him think he can. 
</P>
<P>
"Gill is such a good family man, you have to know how much this has affected 
him," Mora said. "But if there's anyone I trust to pull themselves out of 
something like this, it's Gill. It's the type of person he is, the type of 
faith he has, and I'm sure it's all going to work out."

4TH-DOWN PASS HELPS DENVER WIN; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: ELWAY'S 49-YARD COMPLETION SETS UP A LAST-SECOND FIELD GOAL THAT 
TURNS BACK KANSAS CITY, 24-23.

<P>
There wasn't any title on the line, but the way the Denver Broncos won Monday 
night reminded quarterback John Elway of the Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Elway's fourth-down, 49-yard pass play to Vance Johnson from the Bronco 17-yard 
line led to David Treadwell's 22-yard field goal as time ran out, and Denver 
beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 24-23. 
</P>
<P>
Elway didn't have great numbers -- he finished 14 of 30 for 163 yards -- but he 
compared the finish to the 98-yard drive he engineered to beat the Cleveland 
Browns in the 1986 AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
"It ranks right up there with the Drive, especially coming against a good team 
like Kansas City and with the way things went for us last week," Elway said, 
referring to a 14-9 loss to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"In that situation, the way I look at it, you have nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
It came after Steve DeBerg, who passed for 395 yards, threw an 83-yard 
touchdown pass play to Stephone Paige with 1:44 left to give Kansas City its 
first lead of the game, 23-21. DeBerg and Paige had hooked up on a 16-yard 
scoring pass with 8:01 left as Denver appeared it would blow a 21-9 
fourth-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a couple of big plays, they came back and made the last one," Chief 
Coach Marty Schottenheimer said. "Neither team had quit in them tonight. I 
don't think we had a losers' locker room." 
</P>
<P>
The teams spent most of the first three quarters matching each other score for 
score. The problem for Kansas City was that their scores were Nick Lowery field 
goals and Denver's were touchdowns -- runs of 37 and six yards by Bobby 
Humphrey, who finished with 19 carries for 132 yards, and a two-yard 
quarterback draw by Elway. 
</P>
<P>
The defense, meanwhile, was holding Christian Okoye to 69 yards in 20 carries 
and keeping DeBerg out of the end zone even though he moved well between the 
20s. 
</P>
<P>
But then Albert Lewis blocked Mike Horan's punt with 9:30 left, and after it 
rolled 40 yards, Kevin Porter recovered at the Denver 17. Two plays later, 
DeBerg threw his first touchdown pass to Paige, who finished with 10 catches 
for 206 yards, and Denver led by 21-16. 
</P>
<P>
On its next possession, Kansas City was thwarted when Michael Brooks sacked 
DeBerg and Denver moved into position for a clinching field goal with two 
minutes left. But Treadwell's 38-yarder was wide to the left and that gave the 
Chiefs one more chance. 
</P>
<P>
After an illegal procedure penalty, DeBerg passed to Paige at the Chief 40 and 
the Kansas City receiver broke a tackle by Kip Corrington and ran down the 
right sideline into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Now it was Elway's turn. 
</P>
<P>
After the kickoff and a penalty, three passes fell incomplete -- giving him 10 
consecutive incomplete passes. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with 1:11 left, he found Johnson across the middle and the Denver 
receiver, who caught six passes for 150 yards, ran to the Kansas City 35. Elway 
passed to Mark Jackson at the 18, Humphrey went up the middle to the four and 
all that remained was for Treadwell to convert. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City was kept at bay by a defense led by Steve Atwater, Simon Fletcher 
and Brooks. Fletcher had two sacks, both of which forced fumbles. Brooks had 
the key sack of DeBerg, with four minutes left after the Chiefs had pulled 
within five points. Atwater stopped Okoye for a one-yard loss on third and two 
at the Denver 10 in the second quarter.

SIX CITIES STILL IN CONTENTION FOR '96 GAMES

If the International Olympic Committee has a sentimental bone in its collective 
body, the ancient city of Athens should win in a walk Tuesday when the members 
choose the site of the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
But in an era of broadcast contracts worth megabucks, mammoth national teams, 
and mushrooming security and environmental worries, will sentiment be enough to 
win the day? 
</P>
<P>
That's the question nobody could answer here Monday as the 87 current members 
of the Games' governing board met in a sprawling hotel complex. Tuesday they 
will vote among Athens and five other cities contending for the Olympiad that 
will mark the 100th birthday of the modern revival of the ancient Greek 
athletic competition. 
</P>
<P>
"This choice is so up in the air that nobody, on the committee or off, can 
predict who will win," said Robert Helmick, the Des Moines lawyer who has one 
of the two U.S. votes on the committee as president of the U.S. Olympic 
Committee. Anita DeFrantz, a former Olympic rower and president of the Amateur 
Athletic Foundation, has the other. 
</P>
<P>
The six contending cities -- Athens; Atlanta; Belgrade; Manchester, England; 
Melbourne, Australia; and Toronto -- each will make a half-hour presentation to 
the committee Tuesday, and Helmick said that could be unusually important this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a jury trial," he explained. "In a close case, the summation can be 
decisive." 
</P>
<P>
Following these final plugs, the vote will be taken in a series of secret 
ballots. The sealed envelope containing the name of the winning city will be 
opened, Oscar-style, by IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
With Samaranch not voting, the winner needs its name on 44 ballots. The low 
city drops out in each round until the winner is chosen, and the results of 
each round are posted before the next round. 
</P>
<P>
Although nobody here was predicting a winner, there is a strong emotional pull 
on the committee toward Athens. 
</P>
<P>
The first Olympic Games -- probably a series of running, chariot, spear, and 
archery competitions among Athenian soldiers -- were held near the base of 
Mount Olympus in Greece during the 8th century B.C. The signature event of the 
modern Olympics, the marathon, is based on a famous moment in Greek history, 
when the Athenian Army messenger Phidippides ran 26 miles 385 yards and then, 
with his dying breath, gasped out the words "Victory at Marathon!" 
</P>
<P>
When the French nobleman Baron de Coubertin convinced the world to revive the 
Olympic tradition in 1896, he held the first Olympiad in Athens, and the 
marathon race traced Phidippides' steps. 
</P>
<P>
All that history would be relived, of course, if the centenary of de 
Coubertin's Olympic dream were scheduled for Athens. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to history, Athens has excellent athletic facilities that clearly 
have impressed committee members, Helmick said. But Athens also has major 
traffic bottlenecks and a pollution problem so severe that the ancient Greek 
temples are corroding. If air pollution in Greece is so bad it can imperil the 
Parthenon, what will it do to an athlete's lungs? 
</P>
<P>
Athens, Belgrade, and Manchester all face a geographic problem as well. Since 
winter and summer Olympics will be held in Europe in 1992 (Albertville, France, 
and Barcelona), the committee may want to move to a different continent for the 
'96 Games. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta and Toronto have a similar problem because Olympiads were held in their 
countries -- Los Angeles (1984) and Calgary (1988) -- within the decade. 
Melbourne's boosters have been pushing this geographic argument hard, noting 
that no Olympics has been held in the Southern Hemisphere since 1956 -- in 
Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta contingent here, which includes Mayor Maynard Jackson and former 
congressman and mayor Andrew Young, has been talking up both the city's 
old-fashioned charm and its up-to-date broadcast facilities. Among other 
things, Atlanta has promised customized television feeds of the '96 Games all 
over the world. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the low-key campaigning of the six cities, the IOC acted on a few other 
issues. The members decided Monday to continue the ban against South African 
participation in the Olympics but left open the possibility that the political 
changes there could prompt a reversal. 
</P>
<P>
The IOC said it was joining with five national mints to produce a series of 
legal coins carrying the Olympic rings as part of its 100th birthday 
celebrations. The coin program will involve Austria, Australia, Canada, France 
and Greece, each issuing one gold and two silver coins in succession from 1992 
to 1996. Each will have its own theme. The U.S. Mint was approached about 
joining the coin program but a difficult legislative process ruled out American 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also voted to continue the practice of releasing a flock of doves 
(actually, white pigeons are normally used) during Olympic opening ceremonies. 
Some pigeons evidently were roasted by the Olympic flame on opening day of the 
Seoul Olympics in 1988, and that prompted animal rights groups to demand a 
change for future Olympiads.

Norman Cowins, the University of Georgia's star linebacker, was in the Clarke 
County jail Monday after allegedly attempting to sell cocaine from a truck 
parked in downtown Athens. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Ray Goff suspended Cowins from the team after learning of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Cowins, 21, was arrested and charged Sunday night with possession of a 
controlled substance with intent to distribute, carrying a concealed weapon and 
possession of a firearm in the commission of a crime, Athens Police Major 
Joseph Lumpkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The Clarke County Sheriff's Department said Cowins remained in jail Monday, 
being held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
Lumpkin said the police department received a complaint at 9:39 p.m. Sunday 
that a man was attempting to sell cocaine from a truck at the intersection of 
Henderson and Paris Street. 
</P>
<P>
When officers arrived, they found Cowins, two men, a woman and her young 
daughter at the truck, Lumpkin said. As officers approached the truck, they 
noticed the barrel of a partially hidden semiautomatic pistol in the bed of the 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, officers searched the truck and found a brown bottle containing 
a substance that tested positive for the presence of cocaine, Lumpkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Cowins was the only person in the group arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the facts presented to me, I have decided to suspend Norman Cowins 
from our football team indefinitely," Goff said. "But regardless of the 
circumstances, he's still one of ours, and we are committed to helping him 
through this difficult period." 
</P>
<P>
Cowins, a junior from Douglasville, Ga., has been a standout linebacker for the 
Bulldogs so far, assisting in or executing 10 tackles in his first game. 
</P>
<P>
During spring practice, Cowins won the "Best Tackler" award and was named no. 1 
outside linebacker. He majors in economics.

MORNING BRIEFING: DEMEANING ARTICLES PROMPT THEM TO ANSWER THE BUGEL CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's one of the oldest motivational tools in the book, but that didn't matter 
to Phoenix Cardinal Coach Joe Bugel Sunday. What mattered was that it worked. 
</P>
<P>
After the Cardinals had upset Philadelphia at Veterans Stadium, 23-21, Bugel 
noted that some of the local papers had published uncomplimentary stories about 
his team -- the sort of stories that find their way to an underdog's bulletin 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bugel: "Somebody said we should be playing Temple (instead of the Eagles). 
That's kind of offensive. We don't want to be bulletin board people. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They may try to demean our football team, but we go out in the blistering sun 
every day and bust our butts getting ready for these games. You back a guy into 
a corner enough, he'll come out fighting." 
</P>
<P>
Add Bugel: Was he emotional about his first victory as a head coach in the NFL? 
</P>
<P>
Bugel cried when Cardinal captain Luis Sharpe presented him with the game ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I've cried after a few losses," Bugel said. "I don't think after a win before. 
I saw the look in the players' faces, how much it meant to them. That's what 
got me. It's special when the team gives you the ball. It's going right 
upstairs in our new trophy case." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand: Buddy Ryan, the Philadelphia Eagle's coach, immediately took 
the defensive Monday at his press conference. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters he had no second thoughts about calling a pass play on fourth 
and two at the Phoenix 37, with the Eagles leading, 14-0. Randall Cunningham 
was sacked for a seven-yard loss, and the Cardinals began their comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ryan: "I understand from my PR guy that some of you people didn't like my 
fourth-and-two call. Well, you better get used to it. I'll damn sure do it 
again any time I get ready to." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: When was the last time both major league batting champions played 
in the same city? 
</P>
<P>
Couch potato: Peter Elliott helped unveil the new International Stadium five 
miles from his home in Sheffield, England, Sunday by winning the 1,500 meters 
at the McVitie's Challenge meet in 3 minutes 32.69 seconds, the fastest time 
ever on British soil. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived at the stadium only two hours before dueling with countryman Steve 
Cram, who holds the world record for the mile. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott said afterward that he had spent the early afternoon watching the first 
half of a soccer game on television. 
</P>
<P>
Get this straight: New York Met manager Bud Harrelson was in no mood to quibble 
over semantics after his team lost to Philadelphia Sunday, 8-3. But when Jack 
O'Connell of the Hartford Courant referred to the Mets' open date Monday as an 
"off day," Harrelson was quick to correct him. 
</P>
<P>
Said Harrelson: "An off day is what we just had." 
</P>
<P>
Different kind of header: Azeglio Vicini, the Italian national soccer coach, 
will be on the sideline on crutches at the European Championships in October. 
</P>
<P>
He was awakened by his wife at 3 a.m. Sunday in Cesena. She told him she heard 
noises coming from the street below. 
</P>
<P>
Vicini, 57, leaned over a railing, lost his balance and fell 20 feet, breaking 
his fall on the awning of a restaurant. The coach suffered a broken foot and 
bruised ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: In 1933, Chuck Klein of the Philadelphia Phillies led the 
National League at.368 and Jimmie Foxx of the Athletics led the American League 
at .356.

Chuck Weatherspoon, University of Houston running back, is free on $500 bond 
after being charged with a misdemeanor in connection with the assault of 
another student Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Labs, 33, said he was attacked "out of the blue" and suffered a black 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what provoked him," Labs said. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon, 22, a senior from La Habra, faces a court appearance Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon, who set an NCAA rushing record last season by averaging 9.6 yards 
per carry, was accused of being involved in an incident Saturday night at an 
apartment complex at the school. He was jailed, but was released after posting 
bond on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We received a report that one of our football players was involved in an 
assault," school spokesman Eric Miller said. "We don't know why Weatherspoon 
and the other gentleman got into words, but they did. I have no details about 
who did what to whom."

BEFORE BRUINS GET GIDDY, MICHIGAN IS NEXT; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: DONAHUE SAYS NEXT MOVE IS GETTING THE RUNNING GAME GOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a sense of relief Monday at UCLA, what with the Bruins having ended a 
seven-game winless steak by beating Stanford and the emergence of Tommy Maddox 
as the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
As UCLA prepares to play Michigan Saturday at Ann Arbor, Mich., however, Coach 
Terry Donahue is also aware that his team must improve in other areas, 
especially the running game. 
</P>
<P>
In two games, UCLA has rushed for only 173 yards and an average of 2.8 a carry, 
compared to its opponents' 4.1 average. 
</P>
<P>
A UCLA running back hasn't gained 100 or more yards in a game since the 1988 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do better in the running game because we'll do better in the throwing 
game, and one feeds off another," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
"However, all the ills that plague us have not been cured by the performance of 
one individual player (Maddox). We still have a lot of different problems we 
have to work through to get where we need to be and where I want us to be. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the major problems is the development of tougher, more durable running 
backs. I was delighted with the play of (fullback) Kevin Smith Saturday. It's 
the first time since he has been at UCLA that he has contributed to a victory 
in any significant way. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time we've talked about Kevin's performance and not his 
potential." 
</P>
<P>
Starting for the first time, Smith, a junior, accounted for 75 of UCLA's 145 
yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've got to get other running backs to produce for UCLA football," 
Donahue said. "I understand that's intertwined with the action of the offensive 
line and it's also intertwined with the action of the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, we've got to get a back like Michigan has (Jon Vaughn), who zips up 
there for 200 yards plus (against Notre Dame). I think we've made a 
breakthrough on one front and now we have to make a breakthrough on another 
front." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue's tailbacks are Kevin Williams, Brian Brown and Shawn Wills. Williams 
played only one down in the opening 34-14 loss to Oklahoma because of an ankle 
injury. He started Saturday against Stanford, but gained only 30 yards in 10 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, UCLA was playing catch-up against Stanford and was relying on 
Maddox's passing in the second half, not the running game as the Bruins won, 
32-31, in the final second. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Donahue has been disturbed about the running game all along and is 
puzzled that his backs, as a group, haven't been more productive. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think we have players in our program who can become better running 
backs, and they need to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tailbacks have not been able to develop any durability, or longevity in 
terms of playing the position. Maybe they will." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said that UCLA's deviation from its standard offense to a one-back 
system last year was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
As for Maddox, the redshirt freshman who completed 13 of 20 passes and two 
touchdowns while playing in the second half against Stanford, Donahue said: 
</P>
<P>
"I think with normal progress he will join the line of great quarterbacks we've 
had at UCLA. We won 10 games back to back (1987 and 1988) with Troy Aikman 
because time and again he got us off of the hook. Tommy will get us off the 
hook. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still a green player. He hasn't experienced all the blitzes. You saw him 
against Oklahoma, throwing into coverage twice. Nobody was talking about him 
being a great player after that game. 
</P>
<P>
"But he certainly wasn't as green Saturday as I anticipated he might be. He's 
growing and he's going to get better. Is he an exciting player? You better 
believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue has said that Maddox is an aware quarterback and he showed his 
awareness in the third quarter Saturday when UCLA trailed Stanford, 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
On fourth and four from the Cardinal 34-yard line, Maddox threw a touchdown 
pass to wide receiver Reggie Moore. It seemed like a daring play at the time, 
when the Bruins needed only short yardage for a first down to keep the drive 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We had several different routes, but the major thrust was that we were going 
to run a (short) route for a first down," Donahue said. "But Tommy saw an 
opportunity to throw a deep ball. Touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally in that situation you'd say get the first down. But he's green." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue wasn't quarreling with the decision, though, and was smiling when he 
talked of Maddox's inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said Michigan deserved a better fate against Notre Dame, losing, 28-24, 
even though the Wolverines had 443 yards in total offense to Notre Dame's 399. 
</P>
<P>
"Michigan is a real strong team," he said. "They've got a powerful offensive 
line and all the offensive weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Michigan will try to punch us out of the stadium and dominate us with their 
running game, and obviously they have enough skill to throw (with quarterback 
Elvis Grbac). 
</P>
<P>
"And their defensive team is reminiscent of almost every Michigan team I've 
seen, or faced. They have good athletes moving around with some superior 
athletes in the secondary, like Tripp Welborne. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a typical Michigan team."

<P>
ALERT PLAY COULD HAVE BACKFIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA kicker Brad Daluiso's extra point try was blocked in the fourth quarter of 
Saturday's 32-31 victory over Stanford after quarterback Tommy Maddox, the 
holder, fumbled the snap. Maddox alertly picked up the ball and passed to tight 
end Rick Daly for a two-point conversion and a 29-28 lead. 
</P>
<P>
However, if a Cardinal player had retrieved the ball and carried it to the 
other end zone, Stanford would have scored two points under a rule that was 
enacted last year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought of that possibility at the time, UCLA Coach Terry Donahue 
said: "I knew about the rule, but it wasn't on my mind at the time. I'm not 
going to talk about what was on my mind."

First Start Nothing to Sneeze At 
</P>
<P>
As the high school football player of the year in Arizona two years ago, Mike 
Salmon was hampered by bronchitis and pollen allergies, although he said it is 
not true, as is written in the USC media guide, that he carried an inhaler in 
his sock during games. 
</P>
<P>
But on the eve of his first start for the Trojans Saturday against Penn State, 
it was the freshman cornerback's stomach that troubled him most. He couldn't 
keep food down. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably nerves," said Bobby April, who coaches the Trojans' secondary. 
</P>
<P>
A converted split end who was moved to safety last spring, Salmon was moved 
again to cornerback about a week before the season, when doctors advised 
sophomore DeChon Burns to quit the team because of a congenital spinal defect. 
</P>
<P>
Bothered by his allergies only rarely since his move to California, Salmon said 
he prefers free safety to cornerback. "I feel more comfortable there," he said, 
"but whatever it takes to get on the field . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Washington Coach Don James called on Husky fans to yell themselves hoarse 
Saturday when Washington plays fifth-ranked USC at Husky Stadium. "We need 
their help," James told reporters in Seattle. "I say that because I was looking 
at the tape (Sunday) night and (USC) had a real critical goal-line stand 
(against Penn State) and the scoreboard in the Coliseum said, 'More Noise.' 
They were calling for it. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't bother me if Todd Marinovich didn't hear a cadence all day long."

Colorado Drops to 20th in Poll 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame remained No. 1 in the Associated Press poll Monday after its 
season-opening victory over Michigan, while Colorado dropped out of the top 10 
after losing to Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado fell from ninth to 20th -- its lowest ranking since last year's 
preseason poll -- after losing, 23-22. Illinois rose six spots to No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish, who rallied to beat the Wolverines, 28-24, Saturday night, 
received 44 first-place votes and 1,480 points from a nationwide panel of 
sportswriters and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State got 10 first-place votes and moved past Auburn into second after 
beating Georgia Southern, 48-6. Auburn, which beat Mississippi, 24-10, received 
four first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
Brigham Young rose one spot to No. 4 after overcoming a 22-point halftime 
deficit to beat Washington State, 50-36. Also moving up a notch were USC, to

Press International poll of coaches.) 
</P>
<P>
Michigan fell from No. 4 to No. 7. Nebraska, which had the week off, remained 
No. 8, ahead of No. 9 Miami and No. 10 Virginia.

THE PREPS: IT'S NOT SO EASY SORTING THROUGH THE SPARKS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever there is an athletic transfer case like the one involving cousins 
Derek and Leland Sparks, football players who switched from Van Nuys Montclair 
Prep to Santa Ana Mater Dei last week, there are seldom any real winners. 
Usually, there are just victims. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to imagine that Derek, 17, and Leland, 18, were the masterminds 
behind the controversial transfers which led to a Southern Section 
investigation of Montclair Prep's athletic program and an inquiry into Mater 
Dei's athletic admission policy. 
</P>
<P>
It is also difficult, however, to put all the blame on the Sparks' uncles, 
Jerome and Eric Sparks, who orchestrated the move. They were only looking for 
the best interests of their nephews. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the Southern Section Executive Committee last week, the 
uncles accused the Montclair Prep coaching staff and Principal Vernon Simpson 
of grade tampering, recruiting inducements and supplying false information on 
eligibility guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Sparks and the issue of guardianship have been a big part of the 
problem. Derek Sparks left his mother, June Sparks, in the summer of 1988 in 
Wharton, Tex., and transferred to Wilmington Banning to be under the 
guardianship of Jerome Sparks, June's brother. 
</P>
<P>
Derek then transferred from Banning to Montclair Prep in March, 1989, to live 
with Eric Sparks, another uncle, and Leland Sparks, who had just moved from 
Wharton, in an on-campus apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Derek later moved in with Montclair Prep teammate John Goldbaum and his family 
last spring, after the Sparks' on-campus apartment was torn down. Derek and 
Leland now live with June, who left Wharton to live in Santa Ana earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Debatable transfer cases such as this one are not new to the Southland prep 
athletic scene. Every year there are athletes who transfer, solely to improve 
their chances of exposure in hopes of landing college scholarships. Two years 
ago, quarterback Perry Klein transferred from Palisades to Carson to play 
football, and then transferred after the football season to Santa Monica to 
play volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Most transfers, like the ones made by Klein and the Sparks cousins, are made 
within the rules, however. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section and the City Section do their best in checking eligibility 
of any student participating in sports, especially transfer students. But they 
aren't police and can't monitor every case. 
</P>
<P>
So Derek and Leland Sparks are enrolled at Mater Dei, and the Monarchs were 
cleared of any wrongdoing by the Southern Section Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But questions remain. For example, how did Derek and Leland gain admission to 
Mater Dei? 
</P>
<P>
Derek Sparks was granted eligibility under Southern Section and Mater Dei rules 
despite being on academic probation for having a grade-point average under 2.0 
last spring. He has one semester to improve his grades, which will end after 
football season is completed. Leland Sparks is not eligible because his average 
was below 2.0 for the past two semesters and he didn't take enough core 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the schools in the Angelus League, a Catholic league of which Mater Dei 
is a member, have complained about the Sparks' transfers. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, Loyola will go ahead with its plans of filing a complaint with 
the CAA (Catholic Athletic Assn.) to see if there is preferable admission 
treatment of athletes at Mater Dei," said Jon Dawson, Loyola's athletic 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Vitello, athletic director at Anaheim Servite, said that the Friars turned 
down a similar transfer case last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a prospective student who was a prominent athlete, but we didn't accept 
him because we didn't think that he'd make it through his last two years 
academically," Vitello said. 
</P>
<P>
"These types of transfers give all the Catholic schools a black eye," he said. 
"It gives us a bad perception to the public schools and makes it very difficult 
to schedule opponents because they think all of us recruit and take in 
transfers." 
</P>
<P>
These complaints are not surprising, but would they have been as loud if Derek 
Sparks had not been considered one of the best running backs in the area? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. Questions about transfers become major issues only when the 
athletes are impact players. Derek Sparks fits that description. 
</P>
<P>
The real concern here should not be whether Derek Sparks will lead Mater Dei 
into the playoffs, but whether he is getting any education through all the 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Co-Coach Paul Knox of Dorsey still is not pleased with the City Section's 4-A 
Division football playoff structure, despite his team's 36-0 rout of Manual 
Arts in the season opener Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current setup, all 12 4-A teams will qualify for the playoffs. In 
3-A, 16 of the 37 teams will make the playoffs, with the Western League being 
the new addition this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm known around the city as a person who does not like having two divisions," 
said Knox, whose team is the defending 4-A champion. "The top 3-A teams are as 
good as the 4-A teams. They would not be at a disadvantage to go against 4-A 
competition. The way it is now, we won't play against a team in the playoffs 
who we haven't faced during the regular season." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Joseph, a city athletic administrator, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing for right now is to have two divisions," Joseph said. "Just 
because a (3-A) school has a winning season does not mean that the program is 
ready for the big guys. What we are looking for are steady programs. I don't 
think that playing a team twice in a season should be a problem in football." 
</P>

Kurt Herbst has been named to replace Ollie Butler as basketball coach at

POWAY TRIES TO LIVE UP TO RANKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Poway girls' volleyball team may have a long way to go to live up to its 
No. 2 state preseason ranking in Volleyball Monthly, Coach Lisa Reis said, but 
after two undefeated seasons and five San Diego Section titles in the past six 
years, the Titans again should be one of the powerhouses in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines, which has finished second to Poway the past two years, is ranked 
No. 5 by the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a ways to go to deserve the ranking," Reis said. "It's all there, it's 
just a matter of getting it together. We've been working really hard every day. 
The girls have to keep really focused." 
</P>
<P>
Poway not only lost five of its eight starters, but Reis said the 
characteristics of this year's team are much different. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year the girls weren't just volleyball players. They were three-sport 
girls that were small and really athletic," Reis said. "This year, it's very 
different. We're big, five girls taller than 5-11 so we have a different style 
of play. Last year we were very strong at ball control and defense. We'll be 
pretty strong at the net because we're big. We've lost some really good 
players." 
</P>
<P>
Poway has two key senior starters returning in outside hitter Heather Collins 
and middle blocker Heather Burke. Burke's twin sister, Amy, also a middle 
blocker, also should make a significant contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Shana Purvis, a senior transfer from Bonita Vista, will take Amy Boyer's place 
at setter. Boyer, a three-year starter who graduated, was one of Poway's 
leading players. 
</P>
<P>
"Shana is very talented and a great athlete," Reis said. "She gives a 150% 
effort at all times and never lets up." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Reis will start two freshmen. She said there's usually one 
freshman in the lineup and possibly two on the team, but this year there are 
three on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure I'm losing so many seniors that I better start them early," Reis 
said. "We're going to be really young next year." 
</P>
<P>
The San Marcos and Bishop's field hockey teams had a frustrating time Friday 
night. San Marcos finally won the game, 1-0, in sudden death after tying 0-0 in 
regulation, 2-2 in overtime, 2-2 in strokes then 2-2 in second round of 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Kasey Cooper scored the winning goal for San Marcos (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
"We always have close games with Bishop's," San Marcos Coach Lynne McCarthy 
said. "We would have liked to have scored but nobody could score. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd rather do it now instead of later in the season." 
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln football team (0-3) has not lost three consecutive games since 
1974, Coach Vic Player's first season at the school. That year the Hornets 
finished 2-7. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln opened the season with a 47-13 loss to Honolulu St. Louis in Hawaii 
Aug. 26. Canyon Country High School (Southern Section) defeated St. Louis, 
40-0, last week to break St. Louis' 55-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry did not hire an athletic director to replace Chris Miller, former 
athletic director and football coach, until just a week before classes began, 
but newly appointed John Ferguson said he has had no trouble sliding into the 
position since most of the fall planning was completed. 
</P>
<P>
"A few coaches had talked to me about applying for the position, and I was 
thinking about it," Ferguson said. "A week before school started I was at the 
school and an administrator talked to me about it and encouraged me to apply, 
and I did." 
</P>
<P>
"I always have to have something new to keep me going and this is something 
new." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has been at Patrick Henry for 11 years and is the softball coach. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest game of the year -- the first game of the year. And it was 
one that many anticipated being a preview of the 3-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
But Morse High School missed a grand opportunity to make a grand -- as in, at 
least $1,000 -- when the the teams opened San Diego-area football action. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers hosted Rancho Buena Vista in their home opener at Mesa College in a 
rematch of last year's Section final, but there were no programs available. 
</P>
<P>
The approximately 3,500 fans were left to the mercy of the announcers to 
identify players.

</P>
<P>
LANSFORD IS EXAMINED, BUT HE EXPECTS TO KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ram kicker Mike Lansford, who felt a pop in his right leg while making Sunday's 
opening kickoff, had his kicking leg examined Monday and later said he thinks 
the injury probably isn't enough to prevent him from handling all the kicking 
duties this Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors found a partial tear in a muscle near the Achilles' tendon in 
Lansford's leg. After suffering the injury Sunday, Lansford kicked off only one 
more time but made five extra-point attempts, had one field-goal try tipped and 
another 49-yarder come up short. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty good news," Lansford said after the examination. "It wasn't the 
Achilles. So (the doctor) says that I should be about 100% in two to three 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
With Lansford's uncertain situation in mind, the Rams are bringing in "four or 
five" kickers today for a quick look-see, just in case Lansford is deemed 
unable to make the kickoffs in Sunday's game, Coach John Robinson said. None of 
the kickers are expected to be familiar NFL names -- just guys who can hook on 
for a week or two and kick off. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford will probably still be on the roster even if another kicker is signed, 
though he won't kick off until he is fully healed. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said tight end Damone Johnson, who ended a contract holdout two 
practice days before Sunday's game, played well, but won't yet challenge Pat 
Carter for the starting job. "Pat Carter had a good game. I think the fact that 
D.J. came in might've motivated him a little," Robinson said. He also said that 
Johnson will gradually play more week by week. . . . About 6,000 tickets for 
Sunday's Ram home opener remain unsold, but the Rams are optimistic the game 
will be a sellout 72 hours before game time -- enabling the TV black out to be 
lifted. TIM KAWAKAMI

FAIRPLEX; 
</P>
<P>
PAYOFF ON THE DOUBLE IS RECORD $4,362.40 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BURGART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The largest Daily Double return in the 52 years of racing at the Los Angeles 
County Fair was realized Monday at Fairplex Park when Pain And Glory combined 
with Skylaunch to yield $4,362.40 for a $2 bet. 
</P>
<P>
The winning numbers were 1-10. The previous high was $1,676.40, set two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Pain And Glory was winless in four previous starts before paying $111.40 to win 
the fifth race. Pedro Mercado rode the 3-year-old gelding to a 
three-quarter-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the sixth, Skylaunch provided the fireworks, coming from far back 
under jockey Frank Olivares and returning $84.60. 
</P>
<P>
Pain And Glory had not come closer than 11 1/2 lengths to winning in any of his 
previous starts, and Skylaunch was beaten by 15 3/4 lengths in his only other 
effort, three weeks ago at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
After working Gin Rummy Judy around the tight turns of Santa Anita's training 
track three days ago, trainer Jacque Fulton had no doubts about the filly's 
ability to handle Fairplex Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked her myself on the training track and she really took the turns," 
Fulton said about the winner of the $42,400 Pio Pico Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"The turns are almost the same as at Fairplex and she seemed to like them." 
</P>
<P>
Gin Rummy Judy ran easily through the turns on Fairplex's five-eighths-mile 
oval, settling six lengths off a fast early pace and making a bold move into 
the lead approaching the far turn before drawing off to a 4 3/4-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (jockey David Flores) to grab her out of the gate, lay off the speed 
and get to the outside," said Fulton. 
</P>
<P>
Flores rode to near perfection, letting San Rama and Distinctive Sis sizzle 
through fractions of 21 2/5 for the opening quarter and 44 4/5 for the half. 
</P>
<P>
After opening a big lead on the turn, Gin Rummy Judy coasted home in the 6 
1/2-furlong dash, with Linda Card rallying for second and Skeeter running third 
in the field of nine fillies and mares. Pointedly, the 8-5 favorite, had no 
apparent excuses in finishing fifth under her 122-pound high weight. 
</P>
<P>
Sent off at 5-1, Gin Rummy Judy returned $13.20 while covering the distance in 
1:16 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
Fairplex Notes 
</P>
<P>
On an afternoon of big upsets, nobody had six or five winners in the Pick Six. 
Today's carryover is $17,017. . . . Young Paul Atchison, in his first year at 
Fairplex, picked up his fourth winner when he guided JL's Go at Once to victory 
in Monday's second race. Atchison, 21, is from Idaho Falls, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
With a riding triple Monday, Julio Garcia has moved into a tie with David 
Flores -- at eight victories -- for first in the jockey standings. Corey Black 
was excused from his mounts Monday because he was ill. . . . Valiant Pete, 
coming off a track-record performance at Los Alamitos, is the favorite to win 
today's $52,550 Aprisa Handicap at six furlongs.

</P>
<P>
Ireland's statistics -- 237 yards in 16 carries and four receptions for 70 
yards and three touchdowns -- indicate he had an all-round performance in Santa 
Margarita's game against University Friday. But those numbers don't show the 
crucial plays Ireland made that made the Eagles' drive for a game-winning field 
goal possible. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Ireland had touchdown runs of 45 and 83 yards and caught an 
eight-yard touchdown pass from Trevor Yankoff, which helped the Eagles take a 
21-7 lead at halftime. University rallied to tie the score, 21-21, and with 
less than two minutes remaining, Ireland returned the kickoff 30 yards to give 
Santa Margarita to ball on its 40-yard line. A few plays later, Ireland caught 
a 30-yard pass from Yankoff, putting the ball on the 7, from which Travis 
Lucero kicked the game-winner field goal. Ireland, who was an all-Division IX 
defensive back last season, also made three unassisted tackles and knocked down 
a pass. 
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
Sean Saunders, who rushed 17 times for 203 yards and scored touchdowns on runs 
of 60, 73 and 5 yards in Foothill's 28-23 victory over Woodbridge Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Johnson, who gained 207 yards in 29 carries and scored two touchdowns in 
La Habra's 26-7 victory over Bolsa Grande Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Eggert, who scored 27 goals in the Capistrano Valley water polo team's 
five matches in the Millikan Tournament. Eggert scored six points in the 
Cougars' 13-7 victory over Miraleste in the finals Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gonzales, who was named the athlete of the meet after running three miles 
in 15 minutes 9 seconds, the fastest time of the meet, in the small-schools 
race at the Woodbridge Invitational Saturday.

Stripped of his options by a full-court press of the judicial variety, Brian 
Shaw is returning to the Boston Celtics. The Celtics announced that Shaw has 
agreed to rejoin them after spending a season playing in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"Glad to be back," said Shaw, the former UC Santa Barbara star, during a Boston 
news conference. His return thus ended a bitter legal battle that began after 
he signed a four-year contract with the Celtics last January. At the time, he 
was in the first year of a two-year deal with Il Messaggero of Rome. Shaw 
subsequently attempted to return to the Italian club for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution followed a federal court decision in June, ordering Shaw to end 
the Italian contract and play for Boston, a fine of $50,000 for defying the 
order and meetings between lawyers for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said it was his intention to play one more year with Il Messaggero, then 
return to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"I never ever said or ever felt that I didn't want to be here," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
He felt he got in trouble because he was operating without an agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt at the time that I knew what I was doing and I could do everything 
myself," the 24-year-old player said. "The lesson that I've learned is I don't 
know it all." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw was Boston's first-round draft pick in 1988, who became a starter as a 
rookie and averaged 8.6 points and 5.8 assists.

NEWSWIRE: WALTERS, BLOOM GET COURT REVERSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court in Chicago Monday overturned the racketeering 
convictions of two sports agents who had been accused of signing athletes to 
contracts before their eligibility expired. 
</P>
<P>
The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the convictions of Norby Walters 
and Lloyd Bloom on a legal technicality and did not address the mail fraud, 
racketeering or conspiracy counts. 
</P>
<P>
This left open the possibility of retrial, but prosecutors who handled the case 
were not in their offices after business hours Monday, and it could not be 
learned if they would try again for convictions. 
</P>
<P>
In its ruling, the appeals court said U.S. District Judge George Marovich 
improperly refused to call certain testimony to the jurors' attention during 
his instruction to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, 58, of New York, had been sentenced to five years in prison; Bloom, 
30, of Sherman Oaks was given three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I love everybody! God bless the judges!" Walters shouted into the telephone 
from his New York home minutes after he learned of the reversal. "I believe 
justice was done." 
</P>
<P>
The government said Walters and Bloom paid college athletes thousands of 
dollars to sign secret representation contracts before their eligibility had 
expired, a violation of NCAA rules. The pair was also accused of threatening to 
break the legs of some athletes to keep them from disregarding the contracts.

INDICTMENTS REPORTEDLY NAME KEATING, 3 OTHERS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: SOURCES SAY CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE MADE ABOUT THE ALLEGEDLY FRAUDULENT 
SALE OF NEARLY $200 MILLION IN AMERICAN CONTINENTAL CORP. BONDS THROUGH LINCOLN 
S&amp;L BRANCHES.

A state grand jury investigating the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan has 
issued sealed indictments of Phoenix developer Charles H. Keating Jr. and three 
others, and the charges are expected to be made public today, sources said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments will be the first criminal charges brought relating to 
Irvine-based Lincoln, which collapsed 17 months ago. The failure is expected to 
cost taxpayers more than $2 billion, making it one of the costliest ever. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who in December 
was appointed a special state prosecutor to investigate Lincoln, confirmed that 
his office "has concluded its presentation of evidence to the grand jury." The 
spokeswoman would not say whether indictments had been issued. 
</P>
<P>
However, sources close to the probe said the state grand jury, which has been 
meeting in Van Nuys since mid-April, has issued sealed indictments that are 
expected to be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury focused on the allegedly fraudulent sale of nearly $200 million 
in American Continental Corp. bonds through Lincoln branches. American 
Continental in Phoenix was the parent of Lincoln, and most of its bonds -- now 
nearly worthless -- were sold to Lincoln depositors and elderly investors. 
</P>
<P>
Sources the grand jury had issued indictments against Keating, American 
Continental's former chairman; Judy Wischer, American Continental's former 
president, and Ray Fidel and Robin Symes, both former presidents of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's lawyers would not comment on the investigation. Representatives for 
the others either declined comment or could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS-TV in Los Angeles reported Monday night that Keating would be arraigned in 
Superior Court today on charges of criminal fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and other Lincoln and American Continental officers and directors, as 
well as the lawyers and accountant who advised them, are also under scrutiny in 
a wide-ranging federal grand jury probe centered in Los Angeles, Phoenix and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Also pending is a civil racketeering lawsuit filed by federal regulators 
against Keating and other former American Continental executives. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental, encouraged by deregulation of the thrift industry, 
acquired Lincoln in 1984. Keating then directed the rapid expansion of the 
thrift, investing primarily in junk bonds and Arizona real estate projects. 
</P>
<P>
He attracted the concerns of federal regulators, who tried to rein in his risky 
investment strategy. He enlisted the aid of several U.S. senators, included 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) to keep thrift regulators from curbing his 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 and 1988, American Continental raised funds through the sale of $196 
million in bonds at Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches. An additional 
8,000 investors had bought nearly $80 million more in other debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
Bondholders have claimed in a mountain of civil lawsuits that Lincoln defrauded 
them by pushing uninsured, high-risk securities on them while leading them to 
believe that the bonds were insured. 
</P>
<P>
Bondholders have claimed that Lincoln or American Continental sales people 
persuaded them to invest in the securities when all they really wanted to do 
was put their money into insured certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Their lawyers characterize the sales technique as "classic bait and switch." In 
some cases, investors were told the securities were insured. Some investors 
were never given a copy of the securities prospectus, a long document that is 
supposed to state the risks involved in buying the securities. 
</P>
<P>
The bondholders also claim in their lawsuits that Keating and Lincoln were 
aided by state and federal politicians and by employees and consultants who 
were former government officials. Even Alan Greenspan, as a private economist 
before becoming chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, testified before 
Congress on behalf of Lincoln and its effort to continue investing in risky 
real estate ventures and ungraded securities known as junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has steadfastly claimed he has done nothing wrong, and charges that 
incompetent regulators were the cause of Lincoln's collapse. Last year he sued 
to regain control of Lincoln, saying the thrift was not insolvent when it was 
seized by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin dismissed Keating's suit to recover the 
collapsed thrift and said it was "abundantly clear" Keating and other officials 
abused their positions and looted Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Thrift Supervision now is seeking restitution of $41 million from 
Keating, saying he diverted Lincoln funds for his own use. The agency, 
challenging Keating's assertion that he is broke, also demanded an accounting 
of his personal finances.

FUNDAMERICA SUIT SETTLEMENT GIVEN TENTATIVE APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in San Francisco has tentatively approved a proposed $9-million 
settlement of a class-action lawsuit against FundAmerica, the network marketing 
company that is accused by authorities in several states of running a pyramid 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement is still not final for several reasons -- including a refusal by 
Florida regulators as of late Monday to go along with its terms. Florida 
officials object to a provision requiring them to drop a civil administrative 
action against the Irvine-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
Florida Deputy Comptroller Larry Fuchs called the settlement "inadequate and 
premature" but added that negotiations would continue right up until a 
bankruptcy hearing scheduled for today in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Florida has filed criminal charges against FundAmerica and founder Robert T. 
Edwards and is seeking to collect $30 million in fines. "They (FundAmerica) 
wanted the regulators to back off and leave them alone," Fuchs said. 
</P>
<P>
But FundAmerica attorney J. Pat Powers said the company simply wants to resolve 
all of the lawsuits against it at once. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to settle with the class for this substantial sum of money, it 
will be in return for all claims against FundAmerica," Powers said. 
"FundAmerica tried to negotiate a global settlement." 
</P>
<P>
The class-action lawsuit, filed in late July, originally sought $150 million in 
damages. The suit, which alleged fraud and racketeering, was filed on behalf of 
all persons who had received less in refunds and rebates from FundAmerica's 
discount program than they had spent on memberships. The settlement was reached 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Several states, including California, contend that FundAmerica is a 
well-disguised pyramid scheme that relies on the sale of memberships for its 
revenue. But company officials say it is a legitimate consumer club, obtaining 
discounts for its members on such services as long-distance phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Florida reaches a last-minute agreement with FundAmerica and the 
attorneys who filed the class action, the proposed settlement must win the 
approval of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James N. Barr in Santa Ana. He is to preside 
over a hearing that will examine the settlement as well as decide whether a 
bankruptcy trustee should be named to run FundAmerica. 
</P>
<P>
Besides $9 million in cash, FundAmerica has agreed to give those involved in 
the class action 50% of an estimated $17 million wired overseas by Edwards -- 
if it can be established that the funds were transferred fraudulently. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed settlement calls for FundAmerica and those who sued it to 
establish a committee to investigate the transfers. Some $11.3 million went to 
Acheteur International in Amsterdam and Theta Ltd. of the British West Indies, 
two firms about which so little is known that even FundAmerica's current 
management is mystified. 
</P>
<P>
The company has hired the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick and a San 
Francisco law firm to investigate the transfers. It said it will ask Judge Barr 
to appoint an independent examiner to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica said Monday that it will pay the settlement using funds presently 
frozen in bank accounts at First Interstate. 
</P>
<P>
"The company's hope is to get these matters behind it, so it can make peace 
with regulators where it is going to do business," Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even if the settlement is approved, FundAmerica will still face other 
problems. "We are still going to prosecute the company and we are still going 
to prosecute Bob Edwards, and you can quote me," said Florida Assistant 
Statewide Prosecutor Marty Moore. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica President Mitchell Blumberg said Monday that he believes 
FundAmerica can resume its business within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a wonderful business that gives people a terrific value, and we think 
Americans have a high need for our kind of service," Blumberg said. "We will be 
able to go out and pick up steam and move across the country again."

WORKING HARD TO KEEP 'EM FLYING;

<P>
MODELS: A MANUFACTURER OF RADIO-CONTROLLED HELICOPTERS IS TRYING TO OVERCOME A 
TRADE DISPUTE AND KEEP HIS BUSINESS FROM CRASHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Gorham, president of Gorham Model Products of Calabasas, said he can't 
sleep at night now. He has mortgaged his home to the hilt and used all his 
savings trying to keep his tiny firm, which makes radio-controlled model 
helicopter kits, from crashing. 
</P>
<P>
Things are so grim that, Gorham said, he got a call from his bank earlier this 
month to tell him that his personal checking account was $1,000 overdrawn. He 
instructed the bank to transfer money from the $5,000 he has left from the 
second mortgage he took out on his house. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working day by day now," Gorham said. "All of my moxie is almost gone." 
</P>
<P>
But not completely. Gorham, 68, still has enough pluck left to hope that he 
will be able to obtain bank financing to buy his company the time he says it 
needs to recover. Without a loan, he says, he will be out of business within 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
Gorham blames a Japanese company, Hirobo, for his troubles. Hirobo, Gorham 
said, used to be his biggest supplier, but the company undercut him by allowing 
its Canadian distributors to infiltrate his market in the United States. One of 
the Canadian companies calls it "free trade." Gorham calls it "unfair trade 
practices." 
</P>
<P>
No matter the cause, Gorham is hurting. Gorham's company rang up $3 million in 
sales in 1986 and 1987, and it had profits of about 9 cents on the dollar. From 
that high, annual sales have sunk to a little more than $1 million, and the 
company is losing about $20,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Until May of last year, Gorham was the U.S. distributor for Hirobo's model 
helicopters and related parts. Hirobo, which also makes industrial products, is 
a small company by Japanese standards. But of its roughly $50 million a year in 
revenue, only a small percentage is from selling helicopter models. 
</P>
<P>
The motor-powered models are scaled-down versions of the real thing. The weigh 
between 5 and 9 pounds, are about 4 feet long and up to 1 1/2 feet high. Most 
are sold in toy and hobby shops by a growing legion of radio-controlled-flying 
buffs. Fewer than six companies worldwide make the helicopter parts, assembly 
kits and fully constructed models. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Model Aeronautics has about 180,000 members, association 
spokesman Geoffrey Styles said, and about 95% fly radio-controlled helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Gorham, who is a native of Britain, worked for years as an aerospace engineer. 
In the late 1960s and early '70s, he was the chief engineer of flight guidance 
and control systems for the Lockheed L-1011 commercial jet. After leaving 
Lockheed, he worked as an independent consultant. He became interested in model 
helicopters in 1978, and started building and designing his own 
radio-controlled craft. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Gorham built and flew 10 model helicopters for the movie "All Night 
Long." After the filming was completed, he took the models to a trade show, 
where he got enough orders to get his company off the ground. He formed the 
allegiance with Hirobo in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1987, Gorham said, his sales of Hirobo products -- which then accounted 
for nearly two-thirds of his total -- started to drop precipitously. After 
asking around in the industry, he said, he discovered that many American 
dealers were getting their Hirobo helicopter products from two Canadian 
companies -- Udisco in Montreal and Yellow Aircraft in Vancouver. These 
companies were undercutting his prices -- which range roughly from $200 to $800 
per helicopter -- by about 30%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorham said he built his business on his ability to provide service and 
technical support to his customers; the Canadian companies, he said, are only 
distributors. He said, however, that he would end up giving free service to 
people who bought from the Canadian distributors because there was no way of 
knowing which distributor provided a particular models, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorham complained to Hirobo about the Canadian distributors and also about what 
he saw as other problems, among them poor quality in an important product line, 
which was allowing a competing company to gain market share and was costing 
Gorham money on repairs and replacements. Eventually, Gorham said, Hirobo 
executives consented to meet with him. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place in May, 1989, but it did not produce the results Gorham 
had hoped for. Afterward, Hirobo stopped all shipments to Gorham, he said, and 
did not respond to his many phone calls, letters and faxes. 
</P>
<P>
Hirobo could not be reached for comment. The company now sells its model 
helicopters in the United States through Altech Marketing, an Edison, N.J., 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon Kunin, vice president of Udisco, said he has sold only to dealers in 
Canada but that there is little he can do if those dealers want to sell the 
products in the United States. "That's free trade," he said. "It's restricting 
trade if you tell a dealer, 'You can't sell here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hirobo nonetheless broke a verbal agreement with Gorham by allowing helicopters 
from other distributors to be sold in Gorham's territory, said Robert James 
Terry, a Long Beach-based interpreter who acted as a consultant to Gorham in 
his dealings with Hirobo. But, Terry added, Gorham erred by not insisting that 
the agreement be put in writing from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"John went into a business arrangement with Hirobo on a handshake," Terry said. 
"He made a mistake in dealing with the Japanese in not signing a contract with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Virtually overnight, Gorham said, his business was nearly devastated. He saw 
what he thought was a way out -- using local subcontractors to make replacement 
parts for parts previously bought from Hirobo. He also worked on new designs of 
his own that he hoped would set new standards for helicopter models. 
</P>
<P>
Gorham's efforts have earned respect from model enthusiasts. His helicopters 
are among the most popular, says Larry Spurling, spokesman for the Radio 
Control Hobby Trade Assn. Randy Gibson, events coordinator for the 
International Radio Control Helicopter Assn., said "in a lot of ways, the 
quality has gone up since the separation." 
</P>
<P>
Gorham also cut his overhead and dug further into his parts inventory. His 
staff, once numbering 22, is now down to 15, and "we keep the lights down and 
the heat off," he said.

SIR SPEEDY PAYS $4 MILLION FOR ACCOUNTING FRANCHISER

Sir Speedy Inc., a quick-printing franchiser based here, said Monday it has 
acquired Comprehensive Accounting Corp., an Illinois franchiser of accounting 
services, for more than $4 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The sale, which includes certain franchise contracts, trademarks, trade secrets 
and accounts receivable, will mark Sir Speedy's entry into the financial 
services industry. 
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive operates 223 franchise outlets throughout the United States. The 
outlets are staffed by certified accountants who provide monthly accounting, 
bookkeeping, tax and business consulting services primarily to small and 
medium-size businesses. Founded in 1949, the company had revenue of $10 million 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive plans to move its headquarters from Aurora, Ill., to Carlsbad in 
San Diego County in November, said Don Lowe, Sir Speedy president and chief 
executive. He said about half of Comprehensive's 37 employees have agreed to be 
relocated to California and 20 more employees will be hired by the year's end. 
</P>
<P>
The company eventually will change its name to Comprehensive Business Services 
Inc. Sir Speedy plans to merge the operations of its subsidiary, California 
Franchise Industries Inc., into the new company, Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we liked about (Comprehensive) is that their customers and ours are about 
the same -- small and mid-size companies -- and we're both in the franchising 
business," Lowe said. As the service sector expands at a faster rate than other 
U.S. businesses and new business formation continues to rise, Lowe said there 
will be an increased need for accounting and printing services. 
</P>
<P>
C. Robert Wissler, a Sir Speedy senior vice president, has been named president 
and chief operating officer of Comprehensive, which will be operated as a 
subsidiary of Sir Speedy.

MARTIN AVIATION NAMES NEW PRESIDENT;

<P>
MANAGEMENT: AS CEO, RICHARD M. JANISSE'S MAIN GOAL IS TO EXPAND THE COMPANY'S 
REACH IN AVIATION SERVICES AND IN THE CHARTER INDUSTRY.

<P>
Former World Airways chief executive Richard M. Janisse on Monday was named 
president and chief executive of expansion-minded Martin Aviation, an arm of 
developer William Lyon's growing aviation service business. 
</P>
<P>
Janisse, 41, replaces Marvin Tuomala, a Martin employee for 14 years and 
president since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Martin Aviation said Tuomala resigned last week "to 
pursue other business interests." Tuomala, who left just six months after the 
company was acquired by Lyon and partner David Banmiller, could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, with about $30 million in annual sales, provides aircraft fueling and 
maintenance services, and supplies parts for private, corporate and commercial 
aircraft. It also operates a flight training school, aircraft charter service 
and an aircraft sales operation. 
</P>
<P>
Janisse said one of his immediate chores will be "to improve the overall 
quality" of Martin's various services, which include aircraft sales, charters, 
cleaning and fueling services and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain industry surveys haven't ranked Martin as high" in customer 
satisfaction as its new owners would like it to be, Janisse said. 
</P>
<P>
A major goal, Janisse said, is to expand Martin's reach in the aviation 
services and charter industry. The company currently has an East Coast charter 
operation in Leesburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Janisse, who resigned as World Airway's chief executive in a policy dispute in 
July, has an extensive background in aviation services. 
</P>
<P>
At World, which is based at Dulles International Airport near Washington, he 
ran a $200-million-a-year firm that operated 10 wide-bodied passenger and cargo 
jets for a variety of charter clients. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, he was president of AMR Services Corp., which operated a ground 
service division, a chain of 10 fixed-based operators, an executive aircraft 
charter unit and an aircraft sales division. AMR Services is a unit of AMR 
Corp., the Ft. Worth holding company for American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was acquired earlier this year by Air/Lyon, a holding company formed by 
Lyon, a retired Air Force major general and former co-owner of AirCal, and 
David Banmiller, a former AirCal president. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a month after being acquired by Air/Lyon, 67-year-old Martin 
purchased Million Air, a smaller FBO, as part of a plan to increase its 
presence at the airport. Air/Lyon also owns International Aircraft Support 
Inc., an aircraft engine repair and leasing company in Belmont, Calif., and 
Elsinore Aerospace Services Inc. of Downey, a national operation with ground 
services, design and engineering and airframe maintenance and modification 
divisions.

BABY BELLS CALLING ON SERVICES TO INCREASE SALES; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITION: ANALYSTS AT BROKERAGES SAY THE ADD-ONS OFFER SIGNIFICANT SOURCES 
OF REVENUE FOR THE COMPANIES AND COST THEM VERY LITTLE TO PROVIDE.

The boss needs you to call a client in another part of the country right away, 
but you do not have the phone number at your fingertips. Relax. Directory 
assistance can dial it for you. 
</P>
<P>
Expecting an important call at home? You can tell whether the call is for you 
or for your spouse with personalized telephone rings. 
</P>
<P>
These are just some of the newer services the nation's six regional telephone 
companies are now offering or preparing to offer their customers. And with 
changing lifestyles and the Baby Bells' hunt for more revenue, there are many 
more such services on the way. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a major new source of revenue," said Marianne Bye, an industry analyst 
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., of the service offerings. "It's also a 
high-margin area for the company -- meaning that it costs them very little to 
provide." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton Brown, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, said telephone 
companies are only limited by the sophistication of their networks. 
</P>
<P>
"Little by little, as they improve their network, they can offer more and more 
services, which will enhance their revenue a bit more," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
For St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. -- which serves 9.5 million 
homes and businesses in Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas -- 
add-on services account for about 13% of billed revenue. More than half of its 
customers have at least one of the custom-calling features, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a significant revenue stream," said Southwestern Bell spokesman David 
Martin. "They cover their costs many times over." 
</P>
<P>
BellSouth Corp. of Atlanta anticipates that its add-on services will provide 
about $65 million in revenue to the company this year. Spokesman Terry Johnson 
said BellSouth expects that amount to more than triple in two years and to 
increase sixfold by 1994 as technology improves and certain regulatory matters 
are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies could not provide revenue breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular add-on, Baby Bells say, is Call Waiting, which tells a 
customer already on the phone that he or she has another incoming call and that 
allows that person to answer it. This feature is available in most of the 
country. Call Forwarding, Three-Way Calling and Speed Calling also are becoming 
more available and more popular, experts say. At Southwestern Bell, for 
instance, those features are offered to roughly 90% of the company's territory, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost to the consumer for each add-on usually ranges from $2 to $10 a month, 
the companies say. 
</P>
<P>
One feature, however, has sparked a controversy: Caller ID -- which displays 
the number of an incoming call on a small video device. As offered by Bell 
Atlantic, the feature is priced at about $6.50 a month, plus a charge of 
between $60 and $80 for the viewing device. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses like this service, but it has come under fire from privacy 
advocates, and some states have outlawed it. A Pennsylvania court, for 
instance, declared it a violation of wiretap laws. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Caller ID is available in six areas of the country. In addition, at 
least 22 states are debating whether to allow it. 
</P>
<P>
As for the other services now offered, some of the more unusual are: 
</P>
<P>
* The personalized telephone ring. As many as three phone numbers may be 
combined on one phone line, with a slightly different ring for each. 
</P>
<P>
* The lazy person's phone book. When a customer calls directory assistance, a 
recorded voice provides the number and, for an extra fee of around 30 cents, 
will dial it. 
</P>
<P>
* The distinctive listing. If your name is John Smith and you want to stand out 
among the sea of other John Smiths in the telephone book, you can have your 
listing appear in a different type face. There is an initial charge of around 
$6, and a $3 monthly fee. 
</P>
<P>
* Call Cue. This service offers automatic redialing of the last number you 
attempted to call; if the other line is busy, it will continue redialing for 
you. 
</P>
<P>
* Call Blocker, Call Trace and Priority Call. These provide customers with 
distinctive rings for each of three selected phone numbers for incoming phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
* Call Return. With this, the customer can automatically dial the number of the 
last incoming call, whether or not the original call was answered. Should the 
line be busy, the customer can hang up, but Call Return will automatically keep 
dialing the number and a special ring will notify the customer when the line is 
free. 
</P>
<P>
Jolene Meyer, district manager of new product development for Southwestern 
Bell, said Call Return is the most popular of the newer features. 
</P>
<P>
"Call Return is the most popular of the group, I think, because it's comparable 
to Call Waiting," Meyer said. "The customer doesn't have to do anything. It's 
kind of passive. When we're out in the back yard and we hear the phone ring, 
we're reminded that we have that service and we have the option of answering it 
now or later." 
</P>
<P>
Phone companies say that because of the technology involved in linking central 
offices, it may be a number of years before the add-on services are available 
to all customers. But the demand is definitely there, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"Our lifestyles are demanding more control," Meyer says. "People are kind of 
tired of having their chains pulled every time the phone rings.

FULLERTON MAN OFFERS NEWSLETTER FOR SHOW'S 'JUNKIES'; FOR BUSY DAD, THE 
DEADLINE WORK CAN BE MURDER

You've got your cup of hot java, your cherry pie, your schematic diagrams of 
all last spring's episodes of "Twin Peaks." Now you're ready for the start of 
another year. But wait, do you have the newsletter? After all, more than 600 
people do. 
</P>
<P>
"Six Hundred," mutters Steve Ryan, author of the newsletter and a man who 
expected to attract, at best, maybe 150 subscribers. Ryan is an eclectic kind 
of guy, a collector of things like political buttons and pocket-size football 
schedules, a mortgage banker by day and "Twin Peaks" fan by night. Fan, not 
junkie. 
</P>
<P>
"I really do like the show and make a point to try to watch it, but I don't 
think near to the extent of some of these letters" from subscribers, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
"People have said they've watched the dream sequence over and over again. To me 
that would take some of the enjoyment out of the show . . . to study it to that 
degree. It's still really just entertainment. Why would people want to go that 
deep into it?" 
</P>
<P>
Hey, Steve! If people didn't want to "go that deep" into it, do you think 
they'd be subscribing to your newsletter? 
</P>
<P>
For those who have been woefully out of touch, "Twin Peaks" is a television 
program. The story line is fairly simple. It's about FBI agent Dale Cooper 
trying to solve a murder in a lumber mill town in the Northwest, near the 
Canadian border. And the dream sequence holds the solution to whodunnit. Or 
maybe it doesn't. Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the show can get sort of complicated. The dream sequence, for instance, 
featured a singing dwarf, who talked backwards. There's a lady who talks to a 
log. There's a woman who wears an eye patch and is trying to invent a gizmo for 
silencing window blinds. There are high school students. There's a brothel. 
There's a high school student working in the brothel. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee, usually hallelujahed as "a darn good cup of coffee," is an important 
part of Agent Cooper's life. So is pie, most often cherry pie. 
</P>
<P>
Some call the show a night-time soap opera, but it owes as much to Fellini and 
Bergman as it does to "Dynasty" or "Dallas." David Lynch, who directed such 
movies as "Eraserhead," "Blue Velvet," and "Wild at Heart," and who is 
considered a bit, umm, offbeat, is the co-creator, with Mark Frost, of "Twin 
Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
From the start, when Laura Palmer's body washed ashore and Sheriff Harry Truman 
went to investigate, the show caused a sensation. Fans traded videotapes. 
Friends discussed "who killed Laura Palmer?" Viewers became "Peaks Freaks." And 
Steve Ryan heard opportunity knocking. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan noticed that at work "a lot of people talk about" the show, which after 
airing on a trial basis last spring got picked up by ABC and starts a fall 
season on Sept. 30. "There's a lot of conversation around the water cooler and 
in the lunch room." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan faxed a tiny classified ad to "Rolling Stone" magazine, asking for folks 
who might be interested in forming an "appreciation society" for the new TV 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't know what to expect at first," he said. But when the responses 
started rolling in, with people saying fans should have some way to communicate 
with each other, Ryan concluded that "there's enough other people interested 
that I might as well find out what I could do with a newsletter." 
</P>
<P>
The price is $8 a year for four issues -- which Ryan concedes isn't going to 
make him rich. He hopes he can make enough money to buy himself a home 
computer, which would make it a lot simpler to get the newsletter out. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays the "Twin Peaks Gazette" is a shoestring operation, even if Ryan does 
use an electric typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan writes the newsletter at night "in a mad rush" and turns it over to his 
wife, a registered nurse, to proofread it. He cuts it into columns, pastes it 
onto sheets and drives it to the printer. Meanwhile he hasn't given up the day 
job, collecting mortgage documents and getting them shipped off to investors. 
He also manages to coach his son's soccer team and keep up with what's going on 
in pro football. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old publisher said the newsletter's main value is giving him a 
chance to write something other than memos about loan documents. "I always 
liked to write," Ryan said, and "in high school I was on the school paper." 
</P>
<P>
After college graduation in 1982, he started writing newsletters for 
homeowners' associations, then drifted into running the associations' 
recreation programs, then heeded his brother-in-law's urgings that he try the 
savings and loan business -- but skipped the added suggestion that Texas was 
the place to be in savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
After photocopying loan documents for a while, Ryan switched firms and wound up 
supervising the loan delivery department for a company in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
He said few folks at work know about his other job; for one thing, he doesn't 
want any co-workers getting the idea he's using company supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said about 60% of the subscribers are from Southern California, but that 
more than two dozen states have at least one person who wants the newsletter. 
"I have a feeling that a lot of those (in other states) are kids," Ryan said. 
"I'll get a check with, 'Please send a copy to my daughter who's away at 
school,' some Eastern university." 
</P>
<P>
The initial issue is eight pages and includes a picture of the Briggs family, 
three of the show's characters, as well as a plaintive plea: "Please don't 
photocopy this issue for friends." It also sports a recipe for Snoqualmie Pie 
-- cherry, of course -- courtesy of a city council member in Snoqualmie, Wash., 
where some of the show's exteriors are filmed. 
</P>
<P>
The two middle pages offer a "rerun guide" for folks trying to figure out who 
did Laura Palmer in. Some of the offerings: Leo Johnson is a red herring; Agent 
Cooper probably didn't do it; Audrey Horne "dresses for attention" but is 
"innocent, deep down." 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter also outlines similarities with TV programs and movies from the 
past: 
</P>
<P>
* Both "Twin Peaks" and the long-running television program "The Fugitive" have 
one-armed men as characters. Both the one-armed man in "Twin Peaks" and the 
police lieutenant who tracked Richard Kimble in "The Fugitive" are named 
Gerard. 
</P>
<P>
* In the 1950 Billy Wilder film "Sunset Boulevard," Gordon Cole continually 
calls movie star Norma Desmond. In "Twin Peaks," Gordon Cole is Agent Cooper's 
FBI boss; the boss isn't seen or heard, though we do hear Cooper speaking to 
Cole. 
</P>
<P>
* In the 1944 movie "Laura," Laura is thought to be dead at the start of the 
film. It turns out the victim was mistaken for Laura, who has a friend, Waldo 
Lydecker, who is implicated in the murder. In "Twin Peaks," the apparent victim 
is named Laura, there's a veterinarian named Dr. Lydecker and a myna bird named 
Waldo. 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter also promises in a future issue to provide a complete rundown of 
"Twin Peaks" merchandise, which so far includes Cooper's cassette tapes to his 
secretary, Laura Palmer's diary and a sound-track album. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan says he and his wife have enjoyed the re-runs this summer, though once 
again he hasn't killed himself to watch all of them. He's "taped a few" of the 
shows, but if he forgets a rerun is on -- the reruns have been on Saturday 
nights, while the show ran on Thursdays during the spring -- it's no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
He expects to buckle down to faithful viewing once the fall season arrives 
though, and doesn't want to make the mistake he made with his only previous 
non-homeowner-association newsletter on Bruce Springsteen. 
</P>
<P>
Back while Ryan was working full-time by day and going to college at night he 
was putting out a newsletter on The Boss. Eventually it "just got to be way too 
much," so he folded it. A few months later, the album "Born in the USA" hit the 
stores, followed by the national tour, and Springsteen was hotter than ever, 
drawing numerous fans who might have been willing to shell out for a 
newsletter, had it existed. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably would have taken off," Ryan says ruefully.

PRIVATE DONORS CONTRIBUTE TO GROVE 
</P>

<P>
The financially troubled Grove Shakespeare Festival raised a total of $5,895 in 
private contributions over the weekend, a theater spokesperson said Monday. 
Donations of $3,200 arrived in the mail "mostly in small checks of $10 to $25." 
</P>
<P>
The rest was been raised through curtain pleas at "Othello," the current Grove 
production. 
</P>
<P>
However, the fund-raising campaign being conducted by a group of 14 Garden 
Grove civic and volunteer organizations, to raise as much as $15,000, had yet 
to produce any revenue by Monday, according to Barbara G. Hammerman, Grove's 
managing director. Hammerman claimed last week that goal would be met within a 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
The Grove is caught in a cash-flow crisis and was expected to press the City 
Council Monday evening for a continuing infusion of emergency funds.JAN HERMAN

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY SAYS MOSQUE SHOULD HAVE MINARETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Islamic mosque should be allowed to have exotic domes and minarets, Mayor 
Tom Bradley said Monday as he condemned as "outrageous" a recent City Council 
decision to require a proposed mosque in Granada Hills to alter its design to 
conform with the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley made the comments in a press release while traveling in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Mohuiddin, president of the Islamic Center of Northridge, said he was 
encouraged by the remarks. Mohuiddin heads the congregation that last Tuesday 
won council permission to build a mosque on a 2.5-acre site near Rinaldi and 
Encino boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
"It would make us feel good to have it look like a mosque, not like a 
warehouse," Mohuiddin said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he wanted the Cultural Affairs Commission to hold a hearing in 45 
days in order to develop a city policy on design of religious buildings.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLDEN TOURS L.A. ZOO TO ASSESS CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Nate Holden toured the Los Angeles Zoo Monday, assessing for 
himself the conditions that prompted federal officials to threaten possible 
revocation of its license. 
</P>
<P>
Holden, who was escorted by zoo Director Warren Thomas, said that he saw a need 
for better all-around maintenance but added "from what I've seen today . . . 
they're obviously correcting the most serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
For more than three years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has repeatedly 
cited the zoo for violations ranging from inadequate food storage to pest and 
rodent problems. Department officials say the zoo's administrators have been 
slow in responding to their complaints, prompting them to issue a letter last 
week threatening the zoo with stiff fines or revocation of its license to 
operate if the violations are not corrected immediately. Holden said he will 
submit his findings to council President John Ferraro, who is calling for an 
investigation.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARCHDIOCESE IS HALFWAY TOWARD GOAL FOR 
SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony announced Monday that the archdiocese 
has raised half of its $100-million goal to support inner-city Catholic schools 
and needy students. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles archdiocese's Education Foundation, in its three years of 
existence, has awarded more than $2.5 million in tuition to about 4,500 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said the 100 inner-city Catholic elementary and high schools in the 
archdiocese still have 5,000 empty seats. Mahony said that at many urban 
Catholic-run schools, half of the students are non-Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation President Richard Riordan said 17 people or organizations have 
donated $1 million or more.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 ARRESTED, 2 SOUGHT IN HOSTAGE-ROBBERY 
ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies and SWAT officers arrested two suspects and were looking for 
two others following a hostage-for-ransom robbery attempt at a Bellflower home 
early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The four would-be robbers, armed and upset about not getting paid for a used 
pickup truck they had sold, allegedly creeped into the house of the truck's new 
owner and accosted him as he took a bath, the victim's grandson said. 
</P>
<P>
They then allegedly forced the man to go to his business and get $4,000 due on 
the truck. 
</P>
<P>
The four teen-age intruders let Orlie Coca, 52, owner of a Long Beach auto 
parts store, leave alone to get the money, authorities said. Coca's wife, Lupe, 
46, and grandson, Steben, 8, were kept at their house to ensure the merchant's 
cooperation. Coca called 911 from a cellular phone, authorities said. Two 
suspects fled after waiting for Coca at a restaurant, and two others, who were 
not identified because of their age, were arrested near the home.

EX-DEA AGENT SEEKS USE OF SEIZED FUNDS FOR TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in Los Angeles asked prosecutors and defense attorneys in the 
narcotics trafficking trial of a former U.S. drug agent to try to work out an 
agreement that would allow the defendant to help pay for his defense by using 
money he allegedly made smuggling gold into this country. 
</P>
<P>
If an agreement can be reached, U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter said, he would 
consider allowing up to $150,000 to be used to pay defense costs for former 
Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Darnell Garcia, 43. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers will pay "through the nose" for Garcia's defense if prosecutors and 
defense attorneys fail to reach agreement, Hatter said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Overland, Garcia's attorney, said the former drug agent had more than $4 
million in bank holdings seized in Luxembourg, but that more than $150,000 of 
that money is unrelated to the drug charges Garcia faces. 
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence that Mr. Garcia was involved in extensive gold and jewelry 
transactions unrelated to these charges," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors maintain that those transactions were acts of smuggling gold into 
the United States. Italian jeweler Pietro Saltarelli testified in a sworn 
deposition that Garcia smuggled gold and jewelry into this country for him 
between 1983 and 1987. Assistant U.S. Atty. Stefan D. Stein said the 
government's position is that "these are illegal proceeds no matter how you cut 
it, whether they come from narcotics trafficking or jewelry smuggling." 
</P>
<P>
In court Monday, Overland said Garcia's Rancho Palos Verdes home has been 
seized and Garcia is unable to pay for his defense. He said afterward that he 
was asking Hatter to order the government to request that funds deposited in 
Garcia's Luxembourg account before October, 1984, be allowed to be used for 
defense and investigative costs. 
</P>
<P>
Stein told Hatter that there was probable cause to believe that Garcia engaged 
in narcotics trafficking prior to October, 1984, and that the request for money 
deposited before that date was inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Garcia was involved in the theft of $150,000 in heroin 
from the DEA's Los Angeles evidence vaults in October, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in 1988 charged Garcia and two other former DEA agents, 
John Jackson, 40, of Claremont, and Wayne Countryman, 47, of Walnut, with 
participating in a drug-trafficking and money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Countryman and Jackson have pleaded guilty to numerous charges. Garcia faces 
six counts -- including heroin trafficking and providing DEA intelligence 
information to suspected drug dealers -- when his trial begins Oct. 9.

AGENCY REPORTS 93 HATE CRIMES AGAINST GAYS IN 7 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

More than 90 hate crimes against gays and lesbians in Los Angeles County were 
reported between February and the end of August, a slight increase over the 
number of such offenses committed during a comparable period last year, the 
county's leading gay services agency announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Violence Project of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services 
Center logged 93 hate crimes between Feb. 1 and Aug. 31, said the center's 
legal services director, Roger Coggan. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Coggan said, the center recorded 90 hate crimes between Feb. 16 and 
Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The center recorded 18 reports of hate crimes in August, Coggan said, a 50% 
increase over this year's monthly average of 12. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a basic fact that bigotry against gay and lesbians is the last accepted 
form of bigotry," said David M. Smith, a spokesman for the center. 
</P>
<P>
The center's 1990 hate crime statistics -- scheduled to be released to the 
public today -- were dramatically greater than those compiled by the Los 
Angeles County Human Relations Commission, which recently issued a hate crimes 
report for the first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Human Relations Commission report said that 50 hate crimes were committed 
against gays during the first half of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We work with the center," said Eugene Mornell, director of the Human Relations 
Commission. "But they look at hate crimes a little differently. We use a more 
stringent standard. With many of the agencies we work with -- and this includes 
law enforcement agencies -- we reduce the number. Unless (a hate crime) 
involves a clear violation of a law, we don't include it in our figures." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the center's figures include actions that may not be legal offenses. 
For instance, the center recorded 70 incidents in which anti-gay and 
anti-lesbian slurs were uttered.

SUSPECT IN 1983 VAN NUYS KILLING ARRESTED IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
A construction engineer living openly in a small Mexican town while he was 
sought by Los Angeles police has been arrested on charges he shot his 
brother-in-law to death seven years ago in Van Nuys, Los Angeles police said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gregorio V. Huerta, a 41-year-old Mexican citizen who fled to the town of Jalpa 
in the state of Zacatecas, was arrested Friday night after stepping out of his 
home to talk to a man who said he wanted to hire Huerta for a construction 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The man Huerta thought was a customer actually was Los Angeles Police Detective 
George Padilla, a member of the department's foreign prosecution unit. Huerta 
was taken into custody by the Mexican state judicial police and is being held 
in Zacatecas without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Huerta was sought in connection with the slaying of Van Nuys resident Gary 
Beresford after a dispute on July 18, 1983. Police had searched for Huerta ever 
since Beresford, 34, was shot in an apartment on Oxnard Street. The reason for 
the dispute has never been determined, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective James Vojtecky, head of the Van Nuys homicide squad, said Huerta told 
his arresting officers that "he had been expecting that one day the police 
would come." 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't in hiding," Vojtecky said. "He was living a normal life. There is a 
good possibility he was living there the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
Because Mexico does not extradite its citizens for trial in the United States, 
Huerta will be tried there for the murder, officials said. Los Angeles police 
have provided federal prosecutors in Mexico with translated crime reports and 
other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the slaying, information from witnesses and other evidence led 
detectives to search for Huerta, the brother of Beresford's wife. An arrest 
warrant was issued charging him with murder. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believed that Huerta had fled to his native Mexico, and his 
whereabouts there were unknown. Under department policy, unsolved homicides are 
reviewed annually for new leads and this year detectives recontacted witnesses 
and others who knew Huerta. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a year the case was pulled out and the detectives worked it," said 
Vojtecky. "This time, certain witnesses said they believed Huerta was residing 
in this small town in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Detectives obtained an address where Huerta was receiving mail in Jalpa and 
learned that he was working there as a construction engineer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Padilla and two other Los Angeles detectives went to Jalpa. At the 
address Huerta used as a mail drop, Padilla posed as a man looking to hire him 
for a construction project and was directed to another house where he could 
find Huerta. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was arrested at the second address Friday night.

MUSIC REVIEW: FORTEPIANO RECITAL SHEDS LIGHT ON MOZART 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
The typical piano recital includes something for everyone. A serious Beethoven 
sonata is partnered with a sentimental Chopin nocturne; Debussy's evanescent 
pastels carefully foil Lisztian pyrotechnics. Preethi de Silva's recital Sunday 
afternoon in the Athenaeum, however, was atypical in both programming and 
choice of instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Confining her program to works written between 1775-1790 by two Germanic 
composers, Mozart and C.P.E. Bach, de Silva offered a probing, insightful foray 
into a musical lode mined only superficially by most contemporary piano 
soloists. A native of Sri Lanka, de Silva is a member of the Scripps College 
music faculty. 
</P>
<P>
To give the authentic period flavor to her rarefied repertory, de Silva brought 
with her a fortepiano, a faithful modern copy of a Viennese piano made in 1796 
by the builder Johann Koennicke. 
</P>
<P>
Though a Viennese fortepiano looks like a Baroque harpsichord, its dry, sweet 
sound is made by a hammer mechanism (not from plucking) from which modern 
pianos have evolved. The fortepiano's small scale and wooden frame (the lack of 
an iron frame prevents a high degree of tension in the strings) produces an 
intimate sonority that invites reflective, even introspective, playing. De 
Silva's understated demeanor and the modest scale of the Athenaeum's room were 
ideally matched to this end. 
</P>
<P>
In Mozart's C Minor Fantasy, K. 475, and Adagio in B Minor, K. 540, de Silva 
shed light on the improvisatory character of a composer who is usually 
presented as a paragon of perfectly proportioned structure. Mozart never 
thought of his works as "classical," and de Silva ignored that customary 
label's interpretive straitjacket. Her Mozart was full of nuance, flexibility 
and intimacy. If her supple, carefully manicured keyboard technique facilitated 
the obligatory passage work, it also tended to sound somewhat emotionally 
contained, too monochromatic. Although she exploited the instrument's colors -- 
especially the burnished clarity of the bass notes -- her own emotional palette 
seemed constricted. 
</P>
<P>
Placing these works along with two Mozart sonatas in the context of C.P.E. 
Bach's flighty C Minor Rondo and quirky, mercurial C Major Fantasia highlighted 
Mozart's stylistic dependence on a composer who is usually relegated to 
historical footnotes. But if the motion picture "Amadeus" celebrated Mozart as 
a bizarre genius, programs such as de Silva's help underscore that Mozart was 
also a child of his time, one who benefited from the stylistic innovations of 
his colleagues.

CRUDE OIL PRICES CLOSE AT A RECORD $33.63 PER BARREL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Driven by rising prices in Europe and continued Mideast tension, the price of 
U.S. crude oil closed at a record-high $33.63 a barrel Monday in a bullish 
market that seemed destined to climb even higher this week. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate for delivery in October rose 
by $1.87 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The U.S. benchmark crude heavily 
influences the price consumers pay for gasoline and other fuels. 
</P>
<P>
The previous closing high, $32.35, was reached on Aug. 2, 1983, and matched 
Aug. 23 of this year. So far, the price of West Texas Intermediate has soared 
more than 50% since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The day before the 
invasion, the price of oil was $21.54 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"Crude oil has never traded this high on the Merc," said Randall Rothenberg, a 
broker with Dean Witter International Energy Futures Group in New York. "These 
guys are buying on the fact that (the market is) going up and it's making new 
highs. You've got to participate." 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the day, prices reached $33.75 a barrel before falling back 
slightly. Spiraling oil prices were blamed in part for a sluggish performance 
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial index rose a meager 3.22 points 
to 2,567.33. Previous oil price run-ups have contributed to economic slowdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of gasoline and heating oil also rose Monday but not so dramatically. 
The price of October regular unleaded gasoline closed up 1.31 cents a gallon to 
91.6 cents, and home heating oil increased 2.52 cents a gallon to 85.31 cents. 
Market analysts and traders said the rise in crude oil prices shows no signs of 
slowing, and prices may top $35 a barrel this week. "That's what (traders) 
hope," said Tom Bentz, director of trading at United Energy, which deals in 
energy futures. "The market wanted to go higher. You could just feel it." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. energy markets followed the lead of European trading centers, where prices 
soared earlier. On the European spot market, where crude is bought and sold for 
cash, Britain's widely traded North Sea Brent shot up $2.90 to $36.30 a barrel 
-- the highest level in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans were apparently responding to rumors that the Soviet Union, the 
world's No. 1 producer of oil, had suffered a break in a major pipeline. Soviet 
officials later denied the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
More basically, Mideast tension continued to push oil prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush speech (televised in Iraq) did very little to ease tensions," Bentz 
said. "In fact, it made (the Iraqis) more irate. There seems to be a feeling 
that this thing will come to a head" with warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Higher futures prices also reflect oil company efforts to secure supplies for 
coming months, when the worldwide supply of crude shrinks as a result of the 
embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. Iraq and Kuwait produced a combined 4.7 
million barrels a day before the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
"We are finally begining to feel the effects of the embargo," said Andrew 
Lebow, an oil analyst at E. D. &amp; F. Man International Futures Inc., a 
brokerage firm. As a result, "the crude market rally doesn't seem to show any 
signs of abating." 
</P>
<P>
Traders noted that trading was relatively light, and many participants remained 
on the sidelines in a market that has become too volatile for their tastes. 
Under normal circumstances, traders said, they would have expected 100,000 
contracts to have changed hands, given Monday's surge in prices. Instead, only 
about 80,000 contracts were exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see a broad (range) of participants," Rothenberg said.

SEALED INDICTMENTS REPORTEDLY NAME KEATING, 3 OTHERS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: SOURCES SAY CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE MADE ABOUT THE ALLEGEDLY FRAUDULENT 
SALE OF NEARLY $200 MILLION IN AMERICAN CONTINENTAL CORP. BONDS THROUGH LINCOLN 
S&amp;L BRANCHES.

<P>
A state grand jury investigating the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan has 
issued sealed indictments of Phoenix developer Charles H. Keating Jr. and three 
others, and the charges are expected to be made public today, sources said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments will be the first criminal charges brought relating to 
Irvine-based Lincoln, which collapsed 17 months ago. The failure is expected to 
cost taxpayers more than $2 billion, making it one of the costliest ever. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who in December 
was appointed a special state prosecutor to investigate Lincoln, confirmed that 
his office "has concluded its presentation of evidence to the grand jury." The 
spokeswoman would not say whether indictments had been issued. 
</P>
<P>
However, sources close to the probe said the state grand jury, which has been 
meeting in Van Nuys since mid-April, has issued sealed indictments that are 
expected to be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury focused on the allegedly fraudulent sale of nearly $200 million 
in American Continental Corp. bonds through Lincoln branches. American 
Continental in Phoenix was the parent of Lincoln, and most of its bonds -- now 
nearly worthless -- were sold to Lincoln depositors and elderly investors. 
</P>
<P>
Sources the grand jury had issued indictments against Keating, American 
Continental's former chairman; Judy Wischer, American Continental's former 
president, and Ray Fidel and Robin Symes, both former presidents of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's lawyers would not comment on the investigation. Representatives for 
the others either declined comment or could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS-TV in Los Angeles reported Monday night that Keating would be arraigned in 
Superior Court today on charges of criminal fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and other Lincoln and American Continental officers and directors, as 
well as the lawyers and accountant who advised them, are also under scrutiny in 
a wide-ranging federal grand jury probe centered in Los Angeles, Phoenix and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Also pending is a civil racketeering lawsuit filed by federal regulators 
against Keating and other former American Continental executives.

NEW RULES TO RAISE BANKS' CASH LEVELS, PAYMENTS TO FDIC 
</P>

<P>
The two federal agencies responsible for the fiscal health of the nation's 
saving and loans and commercial banks announced Monday that they will require 
financial institutions under their jurisdiction to hold a larger percentage of 
their assets in cash and other capital. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, the House voted Monday to lift the ceiling on the amount 
the government can raise premiums paid by the nation's banks for federal 
deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Under the change ordered by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the 
Comptroller of the Currency, capital standards will be tightened from about 3% 
to between 4% and 5% of total assets. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules, which take effect Jan. 1, are part of a movement to make capital 
standards uniform throughout the banking industry. Although some especially 
healthy banks will still be permitted to hold only 3% of their assets in cash, 
most financial institutions regulated by the two agencies will now have to 
conform to the tighter standards mandated for banks under the jurisdiction of 
the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke told committee members last week 
that he would prefer to keep the capital standard, or "leverage ratio," at 3%. 
But at the same hearing FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman advocated tighter 
standards to rein in banks inclined to take risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) 
complained in a Senate hearing that "I don't think we can fool around longer 
with the capital issue unsolved," and urged the two regulators to settle the 
issue "in the next 30 days." 
</P>
<P>
Legislation passed last year to resolve the S&amp;L crisis mandated that the 
different federal agencies develop stricter and more uniform capital 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the House vote on federal deposit insurance came four days after 
the legislation was introduced by House Banking Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez 
(D-Tex.). It is part of an accelerating effort to prevent another 
multibillion-dollar bailout of the financial industry. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which also permits the FDIC to increase premiums more frequently, 
grants the agency greater flexibility to manage the weakened federal insurance 
system. 
</P>
<P>
House Banking Committee members have expressed concern throughout the summer 
that the nation's banking industry was weakening and in need of tougher federal 
regulation. A recent federal study reported that "not since its birth during 
the Great Depression has the federal system of deposit insurance for commercial 
banks faced such a period of danger and uncertainty as it does today." 
</P>
<P>
The study showed that the FDIC's Bank Insurance Fund, which is supposed to 
contain $1.25 for every $100 of insured deposits, contains less than half that 
amount -- a mere 60 cents per $100. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to rebuild the fund, last month the FDIC agreed to raise the 
insurance premiums which banks pay to 19.5 cents per $100 of deposits -- a move 
that was expected to generate an additional $2 billion for the fund. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not welcome that increase by any means," said Charlotte LeGates, 
spokesman for the National Council of Savings Institutions. "But it was part of 
the process" of rebuilding the insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
While her group does not oppose the new legislation, she said "we are very 
deeply concerned that future rises will so severely squeeze operating costs 
that a large number of institutions can no longer be competitive." The rates 
"went up like 'zap,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers suggest that Congress is accelerating efforts to be tougher on 
the country's financial industry as the autumn elections approach. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle has introduced similar legislation, and the Senate is expected to take 
action soon.

Hotel Investors Receives Offer: Hotel Investors Corp. and Hotel Investors Trust 
said they have received a $61.5-million cash offer for the companies from 
investor group First West Capital Corp. The companies, whose shares are traded 
on a paired basis on the NYSE, said the $5-a-share offer would be subject to 
several conditions, including cooperation with lenders and completion of the 
deal by the end of the year. Hotel Investors, which has investments or 
management interests in more than 30 hotels, said a previous agreement to sell 
interests in 27 hotels to Japanese investors has been suspended pending review 
of the new offer.

Manuel R. Caldera, a former Los Angeles defense contractor active in community 
affairs, pleaded guilty Monday to conspiracy to commit bribery and defraud the 
United States in connection with a defense contracting scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old investment banker and founder of Amex Systems Inc. faces seven 
years imprisonment and $500,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Caldera, named Hispanic Businessman of the Year by President Reagan in 1983, 
became the 39th person to be convicted in connection with the two-year-old 
Pentagon procurement investigation known as Operation Ill Wind. 
</P>
<P>
Caldera entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in 
suburban Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted giving thousands of dollars to two Navy engineers, Stuart E. Berlin 
and James D. Sampson, "in return for their assistance in obtaining and 
maintaining contracts with the United States Navy," according to a government 
statement filed with his plea. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Joseph Aronica said Caldera bribed the engineers to obtain 
six contracts for his small company from 1978 to 1984. The contracts were 
awarded to Amex Systems under the minority enterprise program managed by the 
Small Business Administration, which does not require competitive bidding, 
Aronica said. 
</P>
<P>
"The contracts had a value of approximately $40 million, with potential 
follow-on value of an additional $100 million between 1984 and 1988," the 
prosecutor said. He added that Caldera sold Amex Systems in November, 1984, for 
$45 million, receiving $28 million as his share. In addition to founding the 
company, he was its chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1984 Amex Systems sale, Caldera began operating an investment banking 
firm under his name in West Los Angeles. He has been a prominent contributor to 
Latino candidates on all political levels and received minor appointments from 
Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of the lucky ones," he said in a 1983 interview with The Times. "I'm 
an American and a Mexican. I'm rich and honorable. Who could ask for anything 
more?"

COMPATIBILITY FIRST MAY BE NEAR AT NCR

NCR Corp. is expected to announce today plans for a new line of computers -- 
from laptops to giant mainframes -- that are compatible with each other because 
they are based on the same microchips and software. It would be an industry 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Using the same type of Intel Corp. microprocessors -- the chips that are the 
brains of computers -- would mean that a laptop, for example, could get at 
information stored on a mainframe. 
</P>
<P>
The computer lines of most major makers are divided among proprietary, or 
company-specific, processing systems and "open" systems such as those based on 
Intel chips. That means that various computers sold by the same company often 
are incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
The industry has moved toward open systems in recent years because corporations 
want to be able to use the same applications software, such as spreadsheets or 
word processing programs, on all computers, no matter what the brand. In 
addition, computer users increasingly want to connect machines in networks -- 
an often-difficult task with incompatible models. 
</P>
<P>
Though not a major player in general-purpose computers, NCR could reap major 
rewards from its new direction, said analysts who provided information Monday 
about the expected announcement. NCR declined to disclose details but scheduled 
a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't write these guys off as a non-factor anymore," said Don Young of the 
investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. "I think it's a pretty bold move 
on their part." 
</P>
<P>
Dayton, Ohio-based NCR long has specialized in computers for banks and retail 
stores, and is a major maker of cash registers and automated teller machines. 
In recent years it has enjoyed success with a line of personal computers built 
to industry standards using Intel chips. 
</P>
<P>
It now plans to phase out its old computers and use those standards and Intel 
chips on its entire product line. 
</P>
<P>
NCR would become the first company to sell high-end mainframe computers based 
on open systems, analysts said. The models would be NCR's entry into the market 
for extremely powerful computers. 
</P>
<P>
The new strategy "will potentially open up their rather narrow market into a 
broad market," said Rick Martin, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 
"The question is, can they be one of the major players? The answer is you just 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
In coming weeks, NCR also is expected to announce software and networking 
systems that will allow the new computer line to be connected throughout a 
company, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
NCR's stock closed down $1.50 at $58 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
NCR's new direction would be another boon to Intel, the Santa Clara chip 
company that is enjoying phenomenal success. Its chips are so popular with 
computer makers that it can't make enough to satisfy demand. 
</P>
<P>
But the news could be troubling to Motorola Inc., which makes chips used in 
some NCR computers. Intel is already the dominant chip producer. 
</P>
<P>
"Motorola's microcomputer business is headed for some tough times," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
NCR sells less than $5 billion worth of computers a year, out of a global 
market of $200 billion, he said. By comparison, International Business Machines 
Corp., the industry leader, has sales of about $60 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, IBM announced a new generation of mainframe computers based 
on a proprietary standard. IBM also said it plans to provide systems that would 
allow the mainframe computer to control corporate-wide computing networks. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, Unisys Corp., the No. 3 computer maker, also is expected to 
announce products for connecting computers throughout a company.

</P>
<P>
The Redwood City, Calif.-based company, which sells relational database 
software, said the cuts were made to bring costs in line with lower growth 
expectations. Oracle also announced the resignation of its chief financial

Bankruptcies Hurting Credit Card Industry: Nearly half of all credit card 
losses are now attributable to personal bankruptcies, up from a third only one 
year ago, according to an industry report. The finding -- contained within the 
American Bankers Assn.'s annual credit card survey -- demonstrates how the 
recent uptick in personal bankruptcies could harm the credit card industry. The 
trade group warned that if allowed to continue, the bankruptcy trend may result 
in higher credit card prices and fees.

Call for Revamping Beef Inspection: The U.S. government must fundamentally 
reform its beef inspection system to protect consumers from a growing incidence 
of food-borne disease, the National Academy of Sciences said. 
</P>
<P>
The academy's Institute of Medicine said the Agriculture Department should 
implement a controversial inspection system, with modifications. The department 
has tested the SIS system, which transfers some inspection duties to the 
meatpacking industry, at five U.S. plants. The idea behind the plan is to make 
the industry assume responsibility for meat quality, while the government 
concentrates on food safety.

CAR DEALERS SUED OVER GRAND BANKRUPTCY CASE; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOS: THE TRUSTEE FOR GLENDORA-BASED GRAND CHEVROLET AND GRAND MOTORS CLAIMS 
SOME FIRMS GOT PREFERRED TREATMENT OVER OTHER CREDITORS. 
</P>

<P>
About 270 Southern California auto dealers who sold cars to Grand Chevrolet and 
its affiliates before the huge operation declared bankruptcy two years ago are 
being sued by the companies' bankruptcy trustee. 
</P>
<P>
The dealers all sold cars to Grand Chevrolet or Grand Motors, a 
dealership-brokerage affiliate, within 90 days of their Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
filing in August, 1988. According to the lawsuits filed last month in federal 
court in Los Angeles, the trustee believes that dealers who received payment in 
the 90 days before the filing got preferential treatment over other creditors 
and therefore should return the money. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Irving Sulmeyer is seeking more than $1 million, according to his 
attorney, Jayne Kaplan. Sulmeyer decided to sue the auto dealers after he and a 
team of auditors reviewed every transaction and check issued by the 
Glendora-based companies, Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Chevrolet, once ranked third largest in the country, collapsed along with 
its affiliates -- Grand Motors Inc., Grand Wilshire Finance Corp., Grand Rizal 
Finance Corp. and Grand Wilshire Capital Inc. -- amid allegations that their 
owner defrauded customers, investors and banks out of about $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Our belief is that these suits were brought on normal, everyday, 
dealer-to-dealer transactions and as a result there are substantial defenses to 
the claims of the trustee," said Steven M. Spector, a Century City attorney 
representing about a dozen of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the dealers are being sued in the six figures," said Peter Welch, 
director of government and legal affairs for the Motor Car Dealers Assn. of 
Southern California. "If they have to pay, it could destroy some dealers." 
</P>
<P>
Welch, a lawyer who is familiar with the case, said he believes that most 
dealers will be able to prove to the bankruptcy court that the transactions 
were made during the normal course of business and the money should not have to 
be returned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think by and large, most of them are going to beat these actions," said 
Welch. 
</P>
<P>
Eminiano (Jun) Reodica, founder of the vast auto network, catered to recent 
Asian immigrants and prided himself on helping newcomers buy cars. In its 
heyday, the operation had about 25 locations, employed 500 and was believed to 
be the largest minority-owned business in California. 
</P>
<P>
Reodica, a Filipino immigrant, vanished shortly after his business empire 
collapsed. Investigators believe he has returned to his native country. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dealers who have been sued are questioning the validity of the 
lawsuits because it is common practice for dealers to sell cars to each other 
to meet customer demands. 
</P>
<P>
"This transaction was as normal as they come," said Carrel Wilson, business 
manager for Mike Smith Honda in San Diego, referring to a deal cited in one of 
the lawsuits. "I do 40 of these kind of sales to other dealers each month." 
</P>
<P>
The trustee is seeking $15,450 plus interest from June 9, 1988, the day Mike 
Smith Honda sold Grand Chevrolet a Honda Accord. Wilson said he sold Grand a 
few other cars but was not a regular supplier.

Fraud Trial of 10 Soybean Traders Begins: Greed motivated 10 Chicago Board of 
Trade soybean traders to cheat their customers, a federal prosecutor said at 
the third fraud and racketeering trial stemming from an FBI probe. The trial 
follows the indictment of a clerk and 18 soybean traders after a 1988 FBI 
investigation that also covered the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The clerk and 
eight other traders have pleaded guilty.

Michael E. Parker will step down as president and chief operating officer of 
Parker Automotive Corp. in Costa Mesa. Orange County developer and banker 
Timothy L. Strader will take over daily operations of the company, a maker of a 
proprietary chemical cleaning system for internal combustion engine fuel 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, the company's founder and major shareholder, will remain chairman and 
chief executive. Strader, a former Koll Co. vice president, is president and 
co-founder of Legacy Cos., an Irvine builder of upscale homes and commercial 
properties, and is founding chairman of CommerceBank, a 13-year-old Newport 
Beach bank with about $230 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Parker was recently sued for fraud by Columbia Savings &amp; Loan. His dealings 
involving bankrupt Parker North American Corp. have prompted the scrutiny of 
federal authorities. Company officials said Strader's appointment had nothing 
to do with Parker's legal woes. JOHN O'DELL

MEXICAN LABOR UNION ACTS TO FORCE OUT CONTROVERSIAL LEADER IN BORDER TOWN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Agapito Gonzalez, who for decades has controlled the maquiladora unions in the 
Mexican border town of Matamoros, is being forced from power by national 
leaders of the Mexican Workers Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Fidel Velazquez, the 90-year-old patriarch of the federation, known by the 
initials CTM, accused Gonzalez of corruption and dismissed him as president of 
the federation's Matamoros branch a week ago. Gonzalez has refused to accept 
the ouster, saying that he was elected as the union's secretary general in 
Matamoros by local union members and was not appointed by Velazquez. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict is expected to be resolved this week. Both Gonzalez and 
representatives of National Maquiladora Assn. were reported to be in Mexico 
City on Monday to discuss the situation with Velasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gonzalez, the 40,000 workers in Matamoros' 83 plants became the 
highest-paid employees among the maquiladoras, which are predominantly 
U.S.-owned factories that assemble export goods from imported components. Union 
gains in Matamoros included a 40-hour work week in a country where 48 hours is 
the norm. 
</P>
<P>
However, in recent years, few new maquiladoras have been started in Matamoros, 
despite a boom in the rest of the border area and the city's relative proximity 
both to Eastern U.S. manufacturing centers and to the Mexican industrial city 
of Monterrey. Tijuana now has five times as many of the plants as Matamoros and 
50% more people working in them. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez is blamed for this situation by factory owners, who accuse him of 
arrogance and of calling strikes for frivolous reasons, such as personal feuds. 
Owners expressed their concerns to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari during 
his recent visit to Rio Bravo, a town west of Matamoros. 
</P>
<P>
Then, early last week, Velazquez announced that Gonzalez would be replaced by 
Diego Navarro, who last year was named head of a new maquiladora union in 
neighboring Reynosa. 
</P>
<P>
Matamoros employers had been predicting Gonzalez's departure since February, 
when the national federation reportedly was auditing local union records. 
</P>
<P>
Maquiladoras are Mexico's third-largest source of foreign exchange -- after oil 
exports and tourism -- and provide about 450,000 jobs. The Mexican government 
actively promotes foreign investment in the factories, emphasizing their low 
labor cost and proximity to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Matamoros federation includes 35 unions representing 87,000 workers, most 
of them employed by maquiladoras.

Blue chip stock prices rose slightly Monday, but the broader market was mixed 
as continuing uncertainty over the Mideast crisis slowed the pace of trading to 
near its lowest level of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index rose 3.22 points to close at 2,567.33, but 
declining issues outpaced advances 763 to 672 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Big Board volume came to a scant 110.60 million shares, the year's third 
slowest, against Friday's 133.39 million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Mideast crisis, in its seventh week, a lack of progress in 
U.S. budget talks also impeded interest. Big investors continued to boycott 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many big question marks," said David Holt, technical research 
chief at Wedbush Morgan Securities. "Institutions don't feel they have to race 
in to start committing money." 
</P>
<P>
News from the Gulf, though scant, offered little encouragement. There were 
reports that Iraq was rounding up young Kuwaitis for the Iraqi army. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pro-Iranian groups threatened to hit American interests around the 
world if U.S. troops attacked Iraq. That helped send oil prices up sharply 
again. 
</P>
<P>
On the budget front, House Speaker Thomas Foley said he expects congressional 
and White House negotiators will reach agreement on a plan by early today. 
</P>
<P>
Still, analysts said they were not hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has any faith in anything happening," said Kenneth Gerbino, head of the 
investment firm that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Oil stocks once again led the short winner's list, as oil rocketed higher. 
Arco gained 1 3/4 to 141 5/8, a 52-week high. Chevron jumped 1 3/4 to 77 7/8, 
Unocal added 1 to 33 1/4 and Halliburton rose 1 1/4 to 55 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* The flip side of the oil rally was that many oil users hit new 52-week lows. 
AMR, parent of American Airlines, lost 3/8 to a new low of 42 7/8. Chrysler 
also closed at its 52-week low, losing 1/8 to 11 7/8. Others on the new-lows 
list included Goodyear, off 7/8 to 19, and computer firm Unisys, off 1/4 to 7 
7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Microsoft climbed 1 to 60 3/4 on speculation that the company could 
strengthen its relationship with IBM on key operating system and software 
issues, analysts said. IBM was up 3/4 to 105 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* McDonnell Douglas gave up 1 7/8 to 50. The stock had been on a hot streak 
recently. Elsewhere in the defense group, Teledyne rose 1 3/8 to 19 5/8. There 
was no news.

Government Bond Prices Head Down 
</P>
<P>
Most government bond prices slid in sluggish trading amid selling sparked by 
higher oil prices and impatience over the lack of a deficit reduction 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 13/32 point, or just over $4 per 
$1,000 face amount, after losing $5.94 on Friday. Its yield, which rises when 
the price falls, went up to 9.06% from 9.02% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Activity was subdued. Traders refrained from staking out significant new 
positions ahead of a key inflation reading due today. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department is scheduled to release the August consumer price index, 
and forecasters said it could register around 1%, reflecting the spike in crude

CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Pounded by Oil Price Increases 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell sharply against major currencies, weighed down by the rise in 
oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency closed in New York at 1.548 German marks, down from 1.570 on 
Friday, and at 136.55 Japanese yen, down from Friday's 137.00. The British 
pound rose to $1.914 from Friday's $1.892. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar opened weaker and continued under pressure over the course of the 
day," said Anne Parker Mills of Shearson Lehman. She said the dollar was in a 
"no-win" situation with respect to the U.S. budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
A budget accord would be taken as a sign of lower interest rates, which would 
be bearish for the dollar, while a failure to reach an accord would underscore 
problems in the economy, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Gold, Oil Futures Advance Sharply 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices rose strongly on New York's Commodity Exchange as fears of 
tightening oil supplies pushed crude oil futures to record highs, spurring 
interest in gold as an inflation hedge. 
</P>
<P>
But precious metals analysts said gold's gains were relatively small compared 
to the advance in energy prices, suggesting that the historical relationship 
between the two markets has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $4.20 to $4.30 higher in New York, with the spot September 
contract at $389.40 an ounce, up $4.30. The more actively traded contract for 
delivery in October closed at $390.60. 
</P>
<P>
Silver futures ended 1.6 to 1.9 cents higher, with September at $4.76 an ounce, 
up 1.6 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The rally extended to five days a run-up in gold prices following a $10.90 
plunge in the September contract on Sept. 10. Gold now has regained all but 10 
cents of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
John Jonat, a trader with Deak International, said traders are focusing more on 
a perception that higher oil prices and the military buildup in Saudi Arabia 
will send the U.S. economy into a recession than the inflationary implications 
of higher oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the old relationships . . . are really in effect any more," he 
said. "I don't see huge investment demand for gold right now coming to the 
rescue. I don't think people are rushing in to buy it again." 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures rose sharply, soybeans 
fell and grain futures advanced.

GEFFEN CANCELS DISTRIBUTION PACT WITH CONTROVERSIAL DEF AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Geffen Records officially terminated its manufacturing and distributing deal 
Monday with Def American Recordings, the Los Angeles-based company whose roster 
includes such controversial acts as comedian Andrew Dice Clay, rap group the 
Geto Boys and hard-rock band Slayer. 
</P>
<P>
"We find ourselves increasingly at odds with Def American's creative 
philosophy," said Geffen spokeswoman Bryn Bridenthal. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we believe both in artistic freedom and the freedom to choose the 
direction of our company, we felt it would be most constructive to encourage 
(Def American owner) Rick Rubin to find a manufacturer/distributor with a 
greater affinity for the direction of his label." 
</P>
<P>
The break came following Geffen's decision last month not to release a Def 
American album by the Geto Boys, branding as offensive the Houston group's 
raps, which sometimes mix brutal imagery and explicit sexual references. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin was unavailable for comment Monday, but he said earlier that he was 
contractually free from Geffen after the label refused to handle the Geto Boys 
record and that the album would be released through the Warner/Elektra/Atlantic 
distribution group. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin's announcement stirred speculation that WEA -- which also, ironically, 
distributes Geffen Records -- would soon take over distribution of all Def 
American releases.STEVE HOCHMAN

LOS ANGELES: PERFECT PLACE FOR CURATORS TO MEET?; 
</P>
<P>
ART: BIG BUSINESS AND GEOPOLITICAL UPHEAVAL ARE ALTERING THE CONCEPT OF WHAT 
MUSEUMS SHOULD BE. ATTENDEES OF A GLOBAL CONFERENCE SAY L.A. SYMBOLIZES THAT 
CHANGE.

<P>
It's the perfect year for the International Committee of Modern Art Museums to 
convene in Los Angeles, according to Margit Rowell, president of the 
organization, which wound up its 25th annual meeting over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
About 85 members, representing modern and contemporary art institutions from 
around the world, spent last week here, attending lecture sessions at Loew's 
Hotel in Santa Monica and visiting museums and private collections in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a time of enormous change in the museum world, and Los Angeles is the 
extreme point of how things are changing -- on a grand scale," said Rowell, 
curator for special projects at the Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid. "Many 
of our members have a 19th-Century idea of what a museum should be: a collector 
and caretaker of art objects and a guardian of national patrimony. But these 
functions are being appropriated by private and commercial entities, and boards 
of trustees are pushing for popular, money-making exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Museums have to question what they should be doing -- if they can continue to 
collect or if they should concentrate on exhibitions. Los Angeles -- with its 
wealth of public and private museums, corporate collections and private 
foundations -- is the perfect place for us to confront these issues very 
openly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Facing such troublesome issues is a profound change for the international 
group. "In the old days, the organization was sort of a club. The models were 
the great museum directors, and the rest of us came to annual conferences to 
get inspiration from them," Rowell said. "But then the meetings became much 
more pragmatic, dealing with such practical matters as insurance, finances and 
ethics. The organization was more important for the kind of exchanges that 
happened between meetings than for the actual meetings." 
</P>
<P>
Determined that this year would be different, Rowell and other officers decided 
to plan a more philosophical program that would stir up discussion and possibly 
help members to solve professional problems. 
</P>
<P>
During a tightly scheduled week -- including scholarly presentations, visits to 
Los Angeles museums and private collections, full-day trips to Santa Barbara 
and Orange County and meals at Los Angeles' top restaurants -- participants 
would attend lecture programs at the hotel and continue discussions informally 
during meals and on bus trips. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday morning, when the group convened for a session on "Enlightened 
Patronage," the plan appeared to be proceeding successfully. "It's the best 
meeting we've had in 10 years," Rowell said. 
</P>
<P>
"The conference has been brilliantly organized. We will leave California with a 
deep sense of having really felt this blossoming, flourishing culture. It's 
powerful, sure, extremely creative and rich," said Irina Subotic, of 
Yugoslavia's State Museum in Belgrade. The only problem, Subotic said, is that 
"everything I see is so different from my country that I can't adapt to it. I 
can just enjoy the spectacle and go home and think about it." 
</P>
<P>
The group's collective thinking process began with a weighty session on 
"Perspectives on the State of Culture at the End of the 20th Century." David 
Elliot, director of the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, England, challenged 
museums to "regroup themselves if they are to justify their survival." He asked 
art historians "to take in the massive cultural, social and political changes 
which are taking place in Russia, Central Europe, Southern Africa and other 
parts of the globe." 
</P>
<P>
He also urged his audience to reconsider the issue of quality, taking into 
account the diverse systems of judging value that exist around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Also pointing to serious problems, New York critic Rosalind Krauss delivered a 
scathing attack on what she calls "the late capitalist museum" -- an 
increasingly industrialized, constantly expanding institution that is geared to 
a mass market. This voracious museum requires ever larger inventories of art 
assets, more physical outlets to sell its product, and new means of leveraging 
collections, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these issues recurred during Thursday's program on "Enlightened 
Patronage," concerning the American way of private funding for the arts. 
Speakers were from Citicorp, the Rockefeller Foundation and the J. Paul Getty 
Trust, all of whom provided major funding for the conference. Jennifer Vorbach 
and Kevin Buchanan, of Citibank's Art Advisory Service in New York, explained 
how the bank's art advisers act as "eyes and ears" for wealthy collectors who 
are too busy to track down new acquisitions. "The enormous growth of private 
wealth worldwide" accounts for the success of the service, which was founded in 
1979, Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
Citibank also offers a credit service that accepts art as collateral on loans. 
The service is generally used by collectors, but the artist Christo in 1983 put 
up some of his work as collateral for a loan on "Surrounded Islands," a huge 
project in which he floated pink fabric around islands in Biscayne Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Alberta Arthurs, director for arts and humanities of the Rockefeller 
Foundation, presented an overview of the foundation's efforts to help museums 
research and present non-Western and American minority art, including the 
current "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985" at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, five speakers from the J. Paul Getty Trust offered insights into the 
complexities of trust programs dedicated to collecting, conservation, 
documentation, scholarship and elementary art education. 
</P>
<P>
The talk and display of private wealth turned off some participants. "After 
seeing all the wealth of California, I will go back to my poor house and my 
poor museum in my poor country, but I will feel that I am quite rich," said 
Frits Bless, of the Van Reekum Museum in Apeldoorin, the Netherlands. "I feel 
quite a lot of emptiness here. I'm glad I don't have to work with people who do 
things for show and don't really know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Other participants seemed unperturbed by money that was unlikely to benefit 
their institutions. "It helps me to understand how things are done here and to 
work with museums here in the future," said Norbert Nobis, deputy director of 
the Springel Museum in Hanover, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"No one came here thinking they would not see a wealthy city. Rich people are 
involved with art everywhere, even in Panama," said Monika Kupfer, adjunct 
curator of Contemporary Art Museum in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first visit to Los Angeles for many participants, some of whom 
gave the city rave reviews. "This conference is special because it is in Los 
Angeles. There's so much going on here, more than in New York. I knew this was 
a big, big city, but I didn't know how big," Nobis said. 
</P>
<P>
The best part of the conference for Kupfer was that she had an opportunity to 
meet and work with far-flung South and Central American colleagues, all of whom 
were brought to Los Angeles by the Rockefeller Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the United Nations of culture, although a lot of countries are 
missing. The conference is as much about international relations and politics 
as it is about culture," Kupfer said. "The wonderful thing for someone who 
comes from a disorganized country is that everything works. The buses come on 
time, the meals are on time and they are always good, the private collectors 
are gracious, the programs are well-organized. That leaves us free to spend all 
our time meeting people and talking about how we can work together on 
exhibitions in the future."

CRITIC AT LARGE: 'HENRY &amp; JUNE': IT'S AN X, BUT THE PUBLIC IS NOT SERVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, Universal screened "Henry &amp; June," Philip Kaufman's already 
controversial film about Henry Miller, his wife, June, and writer Anais Nin in 
Paris in 1931. The purpose of the screening was less for reviews, as such, than 
to engender sympathy for the film's struggle against its X rating and in favor 
of an R rating without trims. 
</P>
<P>
As reports from the Venice Film Festival, where "Henry &amp; June" was shown 
last week, make clear, opinions differ sharply as to its success as a work of 
the filmmakers' art. 
</P>
<P>
What is beyond question, however, is that "Henry &amp; June" is a seriously 
intended, thoughtful and non-exploitative film. Its subject matter happens to 
be human sexuality and three people who raised hob with the taboos and the 
silence that shrouded it in their time. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, should it be rated X? In my judgment, it is an X-rated film or 
the ratings system -- offering parental guidance for children -- has lost its 
bearings altogether. It is an adult film, by, for and about adults, and I think 
that neither the Kaufmans (Phil and his wife, Rose, wrote it together) nor 
anyone else involved would seriously deny that. 
</P>
<P>
A following question is whether Universal should ask Kaufman to cut the film to 
achieve an R rating. The answer to that has to be a resounding no! In the first 
place, I can't imagine what or where you would begin to trim. The film is all 
of a piece, and the butchery would destroy a piece of art without attracting a 
dozen more customers. 
</P>
<P>
A further following question is whether Universal should release the film 
without a rating at all, using only such a cautionary note as the studio saw 
fit to apply. This seems to me to be an entirely sensible answer, even though 
the major studios are, in theory, pledged to use whatever rating the MPAA 
ultimately assigns and to not release unrated films. 
</P>
<P>
But the pledge now seems as anachronistic as the X itself. If the distributors 
and the exhibitors can't bring themselves to dump the X in favor of the less 
inflammatory A (adults only) or NC (no children), there is no reason to 
compound the error by cutting the sense out of the product in the bootless hope 
of conning a few more dollars out of the public. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry &amp; June" is an art film, insufficiently prurient to be satisfying to 
the sex trade of any age, but provocative enough in its questionings about 
sexuality and sexual behavior to demand more maturity than most of the 
under-17s are likely to have. 
</P>
<P>
An underlying question in all this is how much harm an X rating actually does 
to the business of a film, especially a film like "Henry &amp; June," which -- 
despite the notoriety it is acquiring -- is not a mass audience picture. It may 
well be that the harm an X does, insofar as it can be measured, is -- to coin a 
phrase -- overrated. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that given all the pressure, the X rating will be overthrown in the 
appeals process the first week in October. That won't be a tragedy, only a 
further indication of the present disarray in the ratings system that Jack 
Valenti is going to have to address forcefully sooner or later.

Once, what seems like a long time ago, Hisham Alish worked every day in the 
predictable and air-conditioned routine of an Amman bank. The memory seems 
alien to him now, the experience of another being, as distant from his present 
life as regular hours and filling lunches. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning for the last few weeks, Alish, 41, has donned his banker's tie 
and blue blazer to labor in a dazzling and distressing nether world he never 
imagined existed when summer began. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of the volunteer coordinators of a teeming transit camp for about 
15,000 Asian refugees from Kuwait that is being operated by Jordanian charities 
with U.N. help on the site of an industrial fairgrounds in an Amman suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Alish's salary is still paid by the Jordan Islamic Bank, but everything else is 
different. It is more than just the fact that he skips lunch because it is 
discomfiting to eat among so many hungry people. His unexpected new job has 
taught Alish something about life, the world -- and himself, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always believed that people should do something for their country. Now 
I feel almost like a soldier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The camp that Alish helps to administer is an instructive, demanding place. 
</P>
<P>
"It is easy when you do not feel well to call your bank and say you need some 
time off. Now, I work twice as many hours here, but even (when) I am tired and 
out of sorts I know that I must come," Alish said. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the refugees awaiting repatriation are Bangladeshis who worked at 
the bottom end of the Kuwaiti economy, earning, nevertheless, more in a month 
than they could reasonably hope for in a year at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Friends come from the bank to see me. They are as astonished as I at all of 
this. I never realized, for example, that there are only relatively few 
Kuwaitis and that foreigners ran their country," Alish said. "These people have 
fled because they are afraid there will be war, but they care nothing for 
politics. They complain because they lost a chance to earn money and they know 
that things will be difficult for them economically when they reach home." 
</P>
<P>
The education of Hisham Alish has just begun. Repatriation of the refugees is 
painfully slow. The camp will be in business for a long time. It does not 
dismay him. 
</P>
<P>
"I am doing something that I need to do. I will see it through."

Dr. Andrzej Kobryn, 41, and his wife, Anna, 29, had worked in Kuwait city for 
more than four years. They are not sure whether to consider themselves lucky or 
unlucky that they happened to have been in San Francisco, attending a medical 
convention, when Saddam Hussein invaded Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, said Kobryn, an organ transplant specialist, "we lost 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
Having been out of the country when Iraq invaded, the Kobryns and their two 
young children were at least fortunate enough to have been spared the trek 
across the desert made by hundreds of other foreigners, including scores of 
Poles, who were working in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Kobryn wonders if, had he been there, he might have somehow 
managed to retrieve the equivalent of about $30,000 in savings from his bank 
account. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gone now, I am sure," he said, "along with all our clothes, jewelry and 
cars." 
</P>
<P>
Back in Warsaw, Kobryn's wife has returned to work as a surgical nurse at a 
local hospital. But there is no place for Kobryn at his own former job. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians in Poland are notoriously underpaid. When he left Poland for Kuwait 
in 1986, he was paid the equivalent of about $35 a month. His monthly pay in 
Kuwait, including fringe benefits and allowances, was, for him, a staggering 
$3,500 -- a hundred times as much. 
</P>
<P>
It was, he admits, a strange job in a strange country -- teaching organ 
transplant techniques to a handful of mostly millionaire students, most of them 
less than devoted to the idea of practicing medicine. The goal of the 
transplant unit was to bring prestige to Kuwait. It performed about 90 kidney 
transplants a year, with a 92% success rate. 
</P>
<P>
Kobryn acknowledges that he and other expatriate experts working in Kuwait were 
"mere hirelings, but the money was fantastic . . . . Even the Bangladeshis 
sweeping the streets were making enough in a few months to return home and 
build themselves houses." 
</P>
<P>
Now Kobryn is looking for another place to emigrate for work. One possibility 
is South Africa. Prospects in Poland, for the foreseeable future, look bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"We have only the clothes we had with us and Anna's job," Kobryn said. "Now we 
are starting over."

Abdullah Moussawr was driving to work on the morning of Aug. 2 when he came 
upon a crowd in downtown Kuwait city. Suddenly, he realized that cars along the 
road were not parked, but abandoned. The street in front of him was blocked. He 
saw Iraqi soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
A soldier approached Moussawr, 34, and ordered him out of his car, but he 
stepped on the gas instead. The soldier shouted, "Stop," and fired a rifle into 
the air, but Moussawr sped over the center divider in a U-turn and escaped. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked. I was scared. I couldn't believe we'd been invaded, and by a 
brother country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 10 days, Moussawr left home only to buy food. As they had no 
telephone in their new house, he was afraid to leave his family alone. He would 
take his wife and five children to be with relatives while he waited in the 
growing food lines. 
</P>
<P>
"The army began to spread out and block streets. . . . They began to search 
houses. I started to fear for my honor and my wife's. I was living in horror," 
Moussawr said. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to leave. He and his wife, Zahra, gathered the family's clothes, 
passports, birth certificates and school documents. They locked the house, 
piled into the car and took off in a caravan of 23 automobiles toward Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi soldiers had the border crossings barricaded so they drove through the 
desert. The trip was just 2 1/2 hours, but only 11 of the cars made it. Some 
had turned back in fear as soldiers shot at them; others got stuck in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
From Saudi Arabia, the family made its way first to the United Arab Emirates 
and then to Egypt, where they found Zahra's sisters and families in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Moussawr family lives in one room of the Europa Hotel, which is filled 
with Kuwaiti exiles. In the lobby, hand-painted posters protest the invasion. A 
newspaper tacked to a wall lists those who have fled to Saudi Arabia; men and 
women scan it anxiously. 
</P>
<P>
Moussawr, a medical clinic administrator, has almost no money. The Kuwaiti 
Embassy is covering his hotel expenses and will pay for him to rent a modest 
apartment, at least for now. The Egyptian government has said that Kuwaiti 
children may enroll in school. 
</P>
<P>
"I never imagined I could be in exile," Moussawr said, rolling his worry beads 
between a thumb and forefinger. "We can't sleep. . . . No matter how well we 
are treated here, it's never like home."

IRAQ'S INVASION OF KUWAIT HAS JOLTED FAMILIES, JOBS AND HOPES.;

AROUND THE CAPITAL, A WORKWEEK GOES ON AND ON DURING A CRISIS;

<P>
Within hours of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, R. Richard Newcomb was summoned from 
his bed in Alexandria, Va., to the White House, where he worked through the 
night. The pace has slowed only slightly in the five weeks since then. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of the job," Newcomb said during a break between rounds of meetings 
and phone calls in his spacious but Spartan office overlooking Washington's 
Lafayette Park. "It's understood that when you need to go around the clock, you 
do." 
</P>
<P>
As director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, 
Newcomb is charged with implementing President Bush's order to freeze tens of 
billions of dollars worth of Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets. He was among a dozen top 
officials who drafted the executive order authorizing the freeze and imposing a 
trade embargo in the early hours of Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomb, 44, a trim, buttoned-down lawyer who has worked his way up the federal 
bureaucracy for the last 16 years, seems to thrive on the challenge of 14-hour 
days, workweeks without end and high-stakes decisions. Associates describe him 
as meticulous, unflappable and tireless. 
</P>
<P>
For Newcomb, handling the crisis has required policy coordination with the 
State Department, Justice Department, FBI and Customs Service and frequent 
consultations with his counterparts in Britain, Japan, Canada and other 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
He also oversees his staff's answers to about 500 inquiries a day from 
attorneys whose clients have shipments that are held up, tankers unable to 
discharge oil, checks they cannot clear or assets frozen in Kuwaiti-owned 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
Though Newcomb downplays them, there have been sacrifices. He canceled a 
weeklong vacation to Canada with his wife, Katherine, a management analyst at 
the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no time for weekend antique forays or new novels -- his book 
club will do John Irving's "A Prayer for Owen Meany" this month without him. In 
fact, Newcomb has not taken a day off since the invasion, and he recalls only a 
single social lunch in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The rewards, he says, are intrinsic. Still, "someone suggested (that) for all 
his effort, he might get a pet camel from the Kuwaitis," said Steven I. Pinter, 
Newcomb's chief of licensing.

U.S. AGENCY HAS LINE ON THE EAST BLOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Allen Kelly was looking for new markets for his telephone-switching maintenance 
equipment when the opening up of Eastern Europe rang a bell. 
</P>
<P>
The entire former East Bloc was laden with old telephone systems that surely 
needed cleaning and upkeep, he reasoned. The only problem was, where would he 
start? 
</P>
<P>
Then, the West Los Angeles businessman found out about the U.S. Commerce 
Department's East European hot-line service and telephoned to see what he could 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
Much to his surprise, he got more than he bargained for -- a list of the proper 
contacts, the locations of many central telephone offices in each of several 
key metropolitan areas and technical advice. 
</P>
<P>
After writing to representatives of telephone companies throughout the region 
-- and later traveling throughout Eastern Europe -- Kelly expects to sell his 
first batch of equipment this winter. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever information I have needed, they have been able to come up with," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department officials say the service is aimed primarily at smaller 
exporters and would-be investors -- American firms that are interested in 
buying into some of the hundreds of East European companies going on the market 
as a result of privatization efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"There are good opportunities to invest in Eastern Europe," said Jenik Radon, a 
New York lawyer who arranges U.S.-East European business ventures, "but there 
are no real bargains. You are going to have to plow a lot of money into them." 
</P>
<P>
While large corporations generally have the wherewithal to check out emerging 
opportunities in the region, small and medium-sized firms like Kelly's 
typically are stymied by the enormity of the task. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern Europe is a region in which there has been scarce information in the 
past, and the information there got out of date quickly," said Susan Blackman, 
director of the Eastern European Business Information Center, as the hot line 
is formally known. 
</P>
<P>
A day watching the hot line in operation confirms the need for such a resource. 
</P>
<P>
The hot-line staff responds to about 600 calls per week. Since it opened in 
late January, it has fielded more than 22,000 calls. 
</P>
<P>
But as the four permanent staffers and two interns admit, not all callers are 
as successful as Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of callers don't have a very good idea of what they want," said James 
Robb, a hot-line staff member. Often, he added, he tries to focus their 
thinking and provide useful background information. 
</P>
<P>
When the service began, information about business opportunities in Eastern 
Europe was not easy to come by. Existing data was meager, and was dispersed 
among a variety of government agencies. The staff scrambled to collect 
up-to-date economic and market information. 
</P>
<P>
"We just plunged right in," Blackman said. "If we got a question we couldn't 
answer, we'd say, 'Can I call you back on that?' and go and find out." 
</P>
<P>
Some questions still can't be answered, Robb said. "People want specific market 
research, but until last fall there were no markets -- by definition -- or 
they'll want something like a list of Polish textile-makers. But these 
companies are all in transition." 
</P>
<P>
In many areas, the agency is moving to beef up its services. Beginning next 
January, for example, the department's Foreign Commercial Service offices in 
Hungary will conduct preliminary market research for American firms for a $750 
fee. More programs are on next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
There also are wide disparities in the help that the agency can provide in 
individual countries. Information is scarce, for example, in Romania and 
Bulgaria. Facts about East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary are more 
plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest problems facing small businesses is finding enough financing 
to get their projects off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush pledged last year that the United States would provide some 
grants and incentives to help defray the costs of starting business ventures in 
Poland and Hungary. The hot line directs callers to the government offices 
where they can apply for such funds. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even under the best of circumstances, launching a business in Eastern 
Europe can be daunting. It takes time and money to develop contacts and work 
out complicated customs and currency arrangements. Kelly's firm, for instance, 
has spent about $20,000 over the past year to explore its prospects in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
As one Commerce Department staffer put it, "Eastern Europe is not for the faint 
of heart."

A grandmotherly woman from the local "neighborhood committee," the grass-roots 
unit of China's Communist system, appeared at a factory worker's door to seek a 
contribution for the Asian Games. 
</P>
<P>
"Get out of here. Beat it. Scram!" replied the young man, whose pay had already 
been docked to help cover a contribution by his factory to the event, which is 
a sort of mini-Olympics for Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't want to give, then don't give," the woman replied. "No need to be 
so rude." 
</P>
<P>
Amid much public apathy, some open resentment and only scattered patches of 
enthusiasm, Beijing is putting on its best face for the Asian Games, which open 
here on Saturday and run to Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The city is already emblazoned with colorful banners, welcoming billboards and 
ubiquitous statues of Panpan, the cartoon panda that is the games' mascot. A 
wave of construction has been rushed to completion at the new Asian Games 
Village and throughout the city. Peasants, including some who labored to put up 
the new buildings, have been chased out of town. Beijing never has looked so 
prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
China's leaders hope the games will boost the nation's image and mark a virtual 
end to the international ostracism that followed last year's bloody crackdown 
on pro-democracy demonstrations. About 100,000 foreign tourists are expected to 
visit during the games, according to official predictions. Hotels should be 
filled close to capacity for the first time since the June, 1989, massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Domestically, the games are being pushed as a rallying point for national pride 
and a focus of propaganda calling for "stability and unity." A set of torch 
relays through China's provinces is spreading a taste of the event and its 
message throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The games should be "a grand gathering representing the unity of Asia and the 
Asian people," Premier Li Peng told Shin Kanemaru, a powerful elder in Japan's 
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in remarks last month reported by the official 
New China News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Kanemaru's visit reflected the gradual improvement now under way in 
Sino-Japanese relations, a process that the games should advance. China's 
leaders seem to believe that once good relations are restored with Tokyo, 
better ties with the United States and Europe cannot be too far behind. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the Chinese Olympic Committee He Zhenliang said recently that 
success with the Asian Games should provide a foundation for China to bid for 
the Olympics in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait represents an unexpected blow to Beijing, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations originally were that about 4,600 athletes from 38 Asian countries 
would participate in the 27 events at the games. The Iraqi occupation has not 
blocked Kuwait from sending a team of 42 athletes who were out of the country 
when Iraq invaded. They arrived in Beijing on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But it is now very possible that either Iraq will be banned or else some Arab 
countries may boycott the games. A final decision by the Olympic Council of 
Asia is expected Thursday, just two days before the games are due to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Another headache for the government is the fear that with crowds of Chinese 
fans gathered for sporting events, some spark could ignite political protests. 
</P>
<P>
"Some hostile elements at home and abroad do not want the Asian Games to be a 
complete success, so they will try by every possible means to create 
disturbances and even resort to sabotage," Wang Dingfeng, deputy director of 
security for the games, told reporters last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong, in a June interview with the Japanese news agency 
Kyodo, said that China has increased production of tear gas and has beefed up 
squads of riot police to handle any demonstrations during the games. 
</P>
<P>
Security in Beijing, including late-night roadblocks at which cars are stopped 
for identification and searches, is already intense. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts are being made, however, to hide the security fist in a velvet glove. 
</P>
<P>
The official People's Daily ran an article last month about how paramilitary 
police stationed at the Workers' Stadium are studying English "as part of 
activities to 'show off the image of China's armed police and give foreign 
guests a good impression.' " 
</P>
<P>
"These fighters work more than 10 hours a day, and when they come back in the 
evening they're very sleepy, but they wash their faces with cold water and open 
their books," the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a flood of such inspirational prose, residents are giving decidedly 
mixed reviews to the games' preparations. 
</P>
<P>
Many people object to the price tag for the games, estimated at about $530 
million. While most of the money has come from the government, about $125 
million is coming from sponsors and donors. 
</P>
<P>
Donations were supposed to be voluntary. But many people such as the angry 
young factory worker who insulted his neighborhood committee representative 
have been forced to give at their workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
Also, many Beijing residents, including students and others, have been required 
to "volunteer" for weekend manual labor at construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
Another controversial measure is the superficial refurbishing of residential 
compounds, an effort that is giving Beijing something of a Potemkin Village 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Many crumbling neighborhoods of old one-story brick houses, due eventually to 
be torn down, have been hidden behind remodeled storefronts or gray-and-white 
walls embellished with traditional architectural flourishes. Nothing has been 
done to improve the homes, but viewed from passing cars on major thoroughfares, 
the new facades do brighten the city. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of high-rise apartments have been ordered to clear their balconies so 
that they will look neat from the streets. In some buildings, all balconies 
have been glassed in, regardless of individual preferences. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't know whether to laugh or cry," a bank employee commented. "These 
new buildings and meeting halls are too fancy, and they won't be used much. 
Spending so much money on this kind of thing isn't worth it. And this business 
of painting the outsides of buildings facing the street while the insides are 
old and dilapidated is phony. Of course, it makes things more attractive, but 
we shouldn't trick ourselves. It's not just foreigners who are unhappy about 
this. Chinese people are even more unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
So many people are upset, in fact, that a taxi driver confided recently that 
warnings have been issued not to complain about the games to foreign 
journalists. Drivers have been threatened with 10 years in prison if caught 
criticizing the games, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A young woman who works in a factory said that the preparations remind her of 
an old Chinese phrase, which is based on the traditional idea that to be fat is 
synonymous with prosperity: Dazhong lian chong pangzi -- "Slap one's own face 
until it's swollen, in an effort to look imposing." 
</P>
<P>
"The country should improve its economy for several years to give us the 
ability to hold an Olympics or Asian Games," she said. "Holding it so early 
like this makes you feel that our ability isn't up to our ambition." 
</P>
<P>
Yet this woman seemed caught up in the drive to make Beijing a more pleasant 
place, with flashes of idealism counterbalancing her cynicism about the 
official efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing these banners and slogans everywhere gives people an empty, superficial 
impression that we've done a good job," she said. "Putting up a few banners 
with slogans on them in a store doesn't necessarily mean that the store's goods 
and services will be good. If we really want to bring credit on ourselves, we 
should do it in our actions and in our hearts, not just on the surface." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have attempted, with only limited success, to bring some order to 
Beijing's chaotic traffic by cracking down on jaywalkers and cyclists who 
routinely ignore red lights at all but the biggest intersections. A campaign 
against the "three crimes of messiness" -- spitting, littering and dumping -- 
is also under way. 
</P>
<P>
Even dogs are a target. Partly because they often are not vaccinated against 
rabies, which kills tens of thousands of people annually in China, dogs are 
viewed as a threat to health and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"The Asian Games are coming soon, and Beijing should carry out with 
determination a 'wipe out dogs' campaign," a commentator wrote last month in 
the official Beijing Daily. "We should truly achieve the practice of ignoring 
the masters when killing dogs. Regardless of whether the owners are rich and 
arrogant, even if they're awesomely famous, even if they're powerful, all 
should be viewed the same -- the dogs should be killed without delay." 
</P>
<P>
This is not just idle ranting. 
</P>
<P>
One Beijing resident told of an acquaintance whose unlicensed pet dogs were 
killed by neighbors. With an attitude mixing pride of accomplishment and 
criticism of the dog-keeper's transgression, the neighbors then personally 
presented the bodies to their owner.

<P>
Former Sen. Paul Carpenter was convicted Monday of four counts of racketeering, 
extortion and conspiracy for using his Senate office to extract campaign 
contributions from lobbyists and an undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-member jury rejected Carpenter's claim that he accepted a $20,000 
payment from the undercover agent because he was conducting his own "reverse 
sting" of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
After two days of deliberations, the jury found that the Norwalk Democrat used 
his Senate post as a racketeering enterprise and engaged in a pattern of 
extorting campaign contributions from lobbyists seeking legislative action. 
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Carpenter took the verdict stoically and told reporters, "I'm 
glad hanging isn't an option in California for legislators." 
</P>
<P>
With his conviction, Carpenter automatically loses his seat on the State Board 
of Equalization and is disqualified from holding elected office, even if voters 
reelect him to the post in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials said it is too late to take his name off the November 
ballot. If he receives a majority of votes for the board seat the governor will 
name his successor. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction of Carpenter is the second major victory for U.S. Atty. David F. 
Levi, whose office has conducted a five-year investigation of corruption in the 
state Capitol. Earlier this year, then-Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) was 
convicted on seven similar corruption charges stemming from the federal 
undercover sting investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Levi said Carpenter's conviction sends a strong message to the Legislature that 
accepting money in exchange for any legislative action -- even the simple act 
of meeting with a lobbyist -- is a violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't sell your office," Levi said after the verdict. "You can't sell your 
time. You can't sell your attention. You can't sell your judgment." 
</P>
<P>
The case against Carpenter marks the first time federal prosecutors have 
challenged California lawmakers' frequent practice of giving preferential 
treatment to their campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, once the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, faces a potential 
prison sentence of 20 years on each count, plus a maximum fine of $750,000. 
Montoya is now serving a 6 1/2-year sentence at a federal prison near Boron. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter said he would meet with his attorneys to consider whether to appeal 
the conviction. "I'm surprised and disappointed at the jury's verdict," the 
former senator said as he left the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
The Carpenter jury -- short one member because of an illness -- will return to 
court today to determine whether Carpenter should forfeit the $20,000 he 
received from the undercover agent, John E. Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter's conviction on all four counts against him sets the stage for 
additional indictments expected from the federal investigation. Among remaining 
targets are Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier), 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) and Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
"We do expect it (the investigation) to go on for a long time," said Assistant 
U.S. Atty. John P. Panneton, the lead prosecutor in the Carpenter trial. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction is likely to fuel public dissatisfaction with the Legislature at 
a time when voters are considering two measures on the Nov. 6 ballot -- 
Propositions 131 and 140 -- that would limit the number of terms legislators 
can serve. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, who left the Senate in 1986 for his seat on the Board of 
Equalization, was found guilty of extorting $20,000 from Brennan in 1986. The 
undercover agent was posing as an Alabama businessman seeking passage of 
legislation to give his shrimp importing company a $1-million tax break. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter testified that he suspected he was the target of a sting and 
deliberately did not vote on the bill so that he could not be accused of 
selling his vote. In an interview with the FBI and federal prosecutors last 
November, he claimed that he was conducting his own "reverse sting" of the 
undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found that Carpenter extorted the money from Brennan and took specific 
actions to help promote the dummy FBI bill in violation of the law. Among other 
things, Carpenter advised Assemblywoman Moore, the official author of the 
measure, how to get the bill through the Senate. He also pushed Sen. Leroy 
Greene (D-Carmichael), the Senate floor manager of the bill, to take up the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, when Carpenter took a final $5,000 from Brennan, Carpenter told 
him in a tape-recorded conversation, "Hey man, you've got access." 
</P>
<P>
The jury also found Carpenter guilty of conspiring with his aide John Shahabian 
to extort the money from the agent. Shahabian, an unindicted co-conspirator, 
was given immunity in exchange for his cooperation with prosecutors and his 
testimony against Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
Shahabian told the jury that he came up with the $20,000 figure and steered the 
money to Carpenter. In turn, the senator paid Shahabian $7,500 -- a payment 
that prosecutors termed "a kickback for a bribe." 
</P>
<P>
Gerard Hinckley, Carpenter's attorney, argued that Shahabian had acted on his 
own to extort the money from the agent. The defense also charged that Shahabian 
lied about the senator's role in obtaining the payment. 
</P>
<P>
On one charge that arose after the undercover operation became public in 1988, 
the jury found Carpenter guilty of attempting to extort money from a lobbyist 
for the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyist Jeff Thompson testified that he went to see Carpenter about 
legislation that would have helped members of the prison guards union get a pay 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of talking about the bill, Thompson said, the senator berated him for 
giving campaign funds to Republicans. "We were shaken down for money," he told 
the jury. 
</P>
<P>
In finding Carpenter guilty of racketeering, the jury concluded that the 
senator had engaged in a pattern of illegal behavior, extorting money from 
Thompson, the undercover agent and other lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter's credibility suffered during the trial in part because of his 
admission that he lied to the Fair Political Practices Commission in a letter 
about the campaign donation from Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a former aide, Ida Lowe, testified that the senator frequently 
used legislation to raise campaign contributions and tried to block bills of 
those who "had not been appreciative." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to discredit Lowe, the defense pointed out that she had been 
fired by Carpenter and was angry with the senator because he had cheated on his 
wife by dating another member of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors were elated with the conviction of Carpenter on all counts, 
particularly because the evidence against him was not as clear cut as the case 
against Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased that the jury recognized the nuances of this very 
sophisticated crime," Panneton said. "I think in part the message is that it's 
a violation of the law to either subtly or directly send messages to people who 
(are sponsoring) legislation that money is going to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic Leader Barry Keene said the jury's verdict will force 
legislators to re-evaluate their frequent practice of providing "access" to 
individuals who contribute money and ignoring those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, access becomes everything," said Keene, who was called by Carpenter as 
a witness in the trial. "That will be looked at much more carefully." 
</P>
<P>
Levi, who has been nominated by President Bush to become a federal judge, 
described the practice of granting access to campaign contributors more 
bluntly: "I call it the teller's cage outside the legislator's office," he 
said. "That is totally abhorrent and illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, who has a doctorate in experimental psychology, was well known in 
the Legislature for his cold, impersonal style and wry sense of humor. Even his 
lawyer acknowledged to the jury that he was "arrogant" and "rude." 
</P>
<P>
With his conviction, Carpenter is immediately suspended from his $95,052-a-year 
position on the Board of Equalization representing southern and central Los 
Angeles County. He immediately loses his salary and all perks such as his state 
automobile, car phone and telephone credit card, state officials said. Upon his 
sentencing later this year, he will formally forfeit the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, his name will be on the November ballot against Republican Joe H. 
Adams Jr., who is a board employee, and Peace and Freedom Party candidate 
Salomea Honigsfeld, a retired nurse. 
</P>
<P>
If Carpenter wins in the heavily Democratic district, his replacement will most 
likely be selected by the next governor, either Republican Pete Wilson or 
Democrat Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
The Carpenter verdict is the sixth conviction resulting from the long-running 
federal investigation of corruption. In addition to the conviction of Montoya, 
former Yolo County Sheriff Rod Graham, former Yolo County Undersheriff Wendell 
Luttrull and Senate aides Karin Watson and Amiel Jaramillo have all pleaded 
guilty to charges arising from the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who served with 
Carpenter in the Legislature, would only say that "I am very sorry for 
Carpenter and his family."

Election officials said it is too late to take his name off the November

</P>
<P>
He ran for Congress and the state Assembly unsuccessfully three times before he 
finally won election in 1974 to an Assembly seat from Orange County. Two years 
later, he moved up to the Senate, representing parts of northwest Orange County 
and southeast Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction of Carpenter is the second major victory for U.S. Atty. David F.

own to extort the money from the agent. The defense also charged that Shahabian 
lied about the senator's role in obtaining the payment. 
</P>
<P>
On one charge that arose after the undercover operation became public in 1988, 
the jury found Carpenter guilty of attempting to extort money from a lobbyist 
for the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyist Jeff Thompson testified that he went to see Carpenter about 
legislation that would have helped members of the prison guards union get a pay 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of talking about the bill, Thompson said, the senator berated him for 
giving campaign funds to Republicans. "We were shaken down for money," he told 
the jury. 
</P>
<P>
In finding Carpenter guilty of racketeering, the jury concluded that the 
senator had engaged in a pattern of illegal behavior, extorting money from 
Thompson, the undercover agent and other lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter's credibility suffered during the trial in part because of his 
admission that he lied to the Fair Political Practices Commission in a letter 
about the campaign donation from Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a former aide, Ida Lowe, testified that the senator frequently 
used legislation to raise campaign contributions and tried to block bills of 
those who "had not been appreciative." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to discredit Lowe, the defense pointed out that she had been 
fired by Carpenter and was angry with the senator because he had cheated on his 
wife by dating another member of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors were elated with the conviction of Carpenter on all counts, 
particularly because the evidence against him was not as clear cut as the case 
against Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased that the jury recognized the nuances of this very 
sophisticated crime," Panneton said. "I think in part the message is that it's 
a violation of the law to either subtly or directly send messages to people who 
(are sponsoring) legislation that money is going to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic Leader Barry Keene said the jury's verdict will force 
legislators to re-evaluate their frequent practice of providing "access" to 
individuals who contribute money and ignoring those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, access becomes everything," said Keene, who was called by Carpenter as 
a witness in the trial. "That will be looked at much more carefully." 
</P>
<P>
Levi, who has been nominated by President Bush to become a federal judge, 
described the practice of granting access to campaign contributors more 
bluntly: "I call it the teller's cage outside the legislator's office," he 
said. "That is totally abhorrent and illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, who has a doctorate in experimental psychology, was well known in 
the Legislature for his cold, impersonal style and wry sense of humor. Even his 
lawyer acknowledged to the jury that he was "arrogant" and "rude." 
</P>
<P>
With his conviction, Carpenter is immediately suspended from his $95,052-a-year 
position on the Board of Equalization representing southern and central Los 
Angeles County. He immediately loses his salary and all perks such as his state 
automobile, car phone and telephone credit card, state officials said. Upon his 
sentencing later this year, he will formally forfeit the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, his name will be on the November ballot against Republican Joe H. 
Adams Jr., who is a board employee, and Peace and Freedom Party candidate 
Salomea Honigsfeld, a retired nurse. 
</P>
<P>
If Carpenter wins in the heavily Democratic district, his replacement will most 
likely be selected by the next governor, either Republican Pete Wilson or 
Democrat Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
The Carpenter verdict is the sixth conviction resulting from the long-running 
federal investigation of corruption. In addition to the conviction of Montoya, 
former Yolo County Sheriff Rod Graham, former Yolo County Undersheriff Wendell 
Luttrull and Senate aides Karin Watson and Amiel Jaramillo have all pleaded 
guilty to charges arising from the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who served with 
Carpenter in the Legislature, would only say that "I am very sorry for 
Carpenter and his family."

If the San Diego State football program ever wanted to make a positive 
impression on the nation, it will have the opportunity to do so Saturday. 
CBS-TV announced Monday that the SDSU-Brigham Young game, which begins at 12:13 
p.m., will be shown to 80% of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The other 20% will see a Southeast Conference game between Georgia and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
The SDSU-BYU game had been scheduled to be regionally televised, but because of 
the interest in Heisman Trophy contender Ty Detmer and the Cougar team, which 
is ranked fourth by UPI. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have a great opportunity this week to show some people our 
program," Aztec Coach Al Luginbill said. "Just for us to be able and execute 
against a good football team will be interesting." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs will be without the services of freshman linebacker Jamal Duff 
Saturday. Duff missed Saturday's Long Beach State game with a deep contusion of 
his thigh. Trainer Brian Barry said he is being cautious with Duff's injury, 
saying if the bruise does not heal fully, the bone could form in the muscle. 
"We're not going to play Jamal until he's completely healthy," Luginbill said. 
. . . Running back Tommy Booker, who missed most of the second half Saturday 
with an ankle contusion, missed practice with the stomach flu. Barry said he is 
doubtful for Saturday because of the ankle. . . . Safety Zac Stokes, who 
fractured his shoulder early in the preseason, is healthy and ready to play. . 
. . Luginbill announced that freshman safety Sam Williford of Pasadena became 
the 23rd SDSU player to redshirt -- the same number that redshirted last 
season. DAVE McKIBBEN

A 44-year-old man was fatally stabbed for an unknown reason shortly after

<P>
His name was not released pending notification of his family. No arrests have

"He had apparently just walked out to the front of the house and shortly

The victim collapsed inside the house and died. Ferrand said detectives do not 
know the motive for the slaying nor do they have any witnesses who say they saw

KEATING JAILED ON S&amp;L FRAUD INDICTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles H. Keating, who headed the company blamed by the government for the 
nation's biggest savings and loan collapse, was indicted on criminal fraud 
charges today and held on $5-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-count state indictment charges Keating and three others with selling 
securities by false statements or omissions, selling securities without 
qualifications and lying to the state Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The department approved the sale of the junk bonds at branches of the failed 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. The government seized the Irvine-based thrift in 
April, 1989. Regulators estimate the bailout could cost taxpayers as much as $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time criminal charges have been filed against Keating, 66, a 
Phoenix developer who controlled Lincoln through the American Continental Corp. 
holding company, of which he was chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has been under investigation in Lincoln's sale of more than $200 
million in now-worthless junk bonds to 22,000 investors, many of them elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Indicted with him were Judy Wischer, former president of American Continental, 
and Ray Fidel and Robin Symes, both former Lincoln presidents. 
</P>
<P>
The four appeared today in Los Angeles County Superior Court, but Judge Gary 
Klousner postponed their arraignment until Oct. 5 because they had not yet read 
the indictment. Keating had no comment to reporters as he entered the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Despite arguments that all four had appeared in court voluntarily, Klousner 
ordered all four held. Bail was set at $5 million for Keating and $1 million 
apiece for the three others, and they were taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
Symes' attorney, Don Smaltz, called the bail amounts "outrageous," saying they 
were motivated only by hysteria and politics of the case.

U.S. TO SHUT 127 BASES, CUT BACK AT 23 OTHERS

The United States will close or reduce operations at 150 military facilities 
worldwide, including 108 sites in West Germany, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
He said that in response to the reduced Soviet threat in Europe and budget 
problems in Washington the Pentagon would begin shutting operations completely 
at 127 facilities and reducing operations at 23 others beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
The move will affect bases in 10 countries and includes ending U.S. operations 
at three major air bases: Torrejon, near Madrid, and at Lindsey and Hessich 
Oldendorf in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the biggest closing of American bases since the wake of World War 
II, said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams. He said the move would begin in 
fiscal 1991, which begins next month, and would continue for several years. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon declined to estimate the number of troops that might be returned 
to the United States, but the announcement would have a major effect on about 
190,000 American troops now stationed in West Germany, where 94 U.S. facilities 
will be shut and operations reduced at 14. 
</P>
<P>
Other countries affected by the move include Japan, Korea, Italy, Greece, 
Canada, Britain, Australia and one base in Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second such base-closing announcement by Cheney this year in 
response to warming U.S.-Soviet relations and a major federal budget crunch. In 
January, he announced the shutdown of 14 overseas facilities and asked Congress 
to agree to close another 69 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. law, Cheney can close overseas bases without congressional approval, 
although lawmakers can wield major influence through budget controls. Domestic 
base closings are a touchy political and financial issue in Congress.

Two teddy bears were cut from quilt panels during the weekend and were later

"It's like going to a cemetery and kicking over tombstones," said Jerry Suarez,

A man convicted in California of raping a 15-year-old girl and hacking off her 
arms walked out of a county jail today after serving 48 days on a petty theft 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Singleton, 62, initially pleaded innocent to the second-degree 
misdemeanor charge of petty theft but changed his plea July 31, citing his past 
record and saying he did not believe he could get a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
He was released about 6 a.m. today, 12 days short of his maximum 60-day 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton was arrested by sheriff's deputies April 8 at a Brandon drugstore in 
rural Hillsborough County after a guard spotted him taking an instant camera 
from a display. 
</P>
<P>
In California, he served eight years and four months of a 14-year sentence for 
raping the teen-ager and leaving her for dead along a roadside in central 
California in 1978.

Patti Davis blames her father, Ronald Reagan, for the increase in the nation's 
homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who frequently has been critical of her father's environmental record, 
wrote an article for Parade magazine in which she says the homeless problem 
mushroomed when the Reagan Administration decided to trim "excess" from the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us a while to realize that some of that 'excess' translated into human 
lives, discarded onto the streets," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Davis says she had to change her regular jogging route in Southern California 
because it went past a settlement of homeless people and she was afraid they 
would confront her about her father. 
</P>
<P>
"What would I say if I were asked why I didn't talk to my father . . . about 
this national tragedy?" she says. "I would have to try to explain that I didn't 
know how -- how do you argue with someone who states that the people who are 
sleeping on the grates of the streets of America 'are homeless by choice?' "

BOTH SIDES OF ABORTION ISSUE ATTACK SOUTER

Supporters of abortion rights asked the Senate Judiciary Committee today to 
reject David H. Souter's nomination to the Supreme Court. "The health and lives 
of millions of American women" are at stake, they said. 
</P>
<P>
A leading conservative, meanwhile, said Souter should not be confirmed because 
he hasn't done enough to stop abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In three days of testimony that ended Monday night, Souter declined to disclose 
his views on abortion. The nominee said he had not made up his mind on whether 
to overturn the 1973 court ruling legalizing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider placing Judge Souter on the Supreme Court to be too great a risk," 
said Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"The health and lives of million of American women, for generations to come, 
may depend on where David Souter stands," said Faye Wattleton, president of 
Planned Parenthood of America. 
</P>
<P>
Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women, told the 
committee that Souter's testimony should raise concern not only that he would 
cast the deciding vote in an abortion challenge, but a Supreme Court that 
includes Souter also could reverse earlier privacy rulings establishing a right 
to use birth control devices. 
</P>
<P>
"I tremble for this country if you confirm David Souter," Yard said. 
</P>
<P>
A strong anti-abortion conservative, Howard Phillips, said that Souter should 
be rejected as too pro-abortion. Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, 
noted that Souter served on the boards of two hospitals where abortions were 
performed and had gone along with the practice.

The unions at United Airlines plan to meet with banks this week to discuss a 
new offer of as much as $3.92 billion for United's parent, UAL Corp., according 
to a published report today. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal said the new offer, the latest in a series of on-again, 
off-again deals for one of the nation's biggest airlines, could amount to $175 
a share to $180 a share, or $3.82 billion to $3.92 billion. 
</P>
<P>
That would be well below the $201 a share, or $4.38 billion, offer from a labor 
group that UAL's board accepted last April. That pact has been scuttled by the 
financial uncertainty created by the crisis in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Citing unidentified officials close to the proposed deal, the newspaper said 
the new offer probably would include participation by a foreign airline. The 
story said a logical possibility would be British Airways PLC, which was a 
principal equity investor in a $300-a-share labor-management bid that collapsed 
last October.

Bad news on inflation and trade unsettled the stock market today but an 
afternoon rebound enabled the blue chips to eke out a small gain. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which showed a loss of more than 20 
points at 2 p.m. on Wall Street, finished with a gain of 3.96 at 2,571.29. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 619 up, 830 down and 511 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 141.13 million shares, against 110.60 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained 0.26 to 174.88. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index sank 2.02 to 319.69. 
</P>
<P>
Two government reports released before trading opened intensified anxiety over 
the economy's condition. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.8% in August, pushed up by the 
energy price spiral set in motion when Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S. merchandise trade 
deficit jumped a dramatic 75% to $9.33 billion in July. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've had a whole series of economic disappointments.," said Michael 
Metz, chief market analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "The question is whether 
the Fed opts to fight inflation or fight a recession." 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board is widely believed to be weighing whether to pump 
life into the economy by lowering interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank has indicated it would be inclined to relax its monetary 
policy if White House and congressional negotiators agree on ways to trim the 
budget deficit. But inflation considerations might stay the Fed's hand -- 
especially if the Middle East crisis drags on and keeps oil prices rising. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell sharply in early trading today.

Cox, 45, the first economist to be appointed a member of the SEC, stepped down

the independent commission for nearly six years. Before that he had been the

Pan American World Airways is poised to cut up to 10% of its work force, or 
about 2,800 workers nationwide, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Airline officials in New York declined to comment on the report but Bill 
Genoese, director of the airline division of the International Brotherhood of 
Teamsters, which represents about 6,500 Pan Am employees, said the cuts were 
triggered by soaring fuel prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Pan Am has plans to cut up to 10% due to the fuel crisis. The cuts will be 
across the board," Genoese told the Miami Herald. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I have no comment other than to say we are studying work force 
levels," Pan Am spokeswoman Susan Timper said. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am could announce the cuts as early as Wednesday, when company Chairman 
Thomas Plaskett is scheduled to address analysts in New York, the Herald said.

Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn, a four-time National League batting champion, 
will undergo an operation Wednesday to repair a fractured finger that ended his 
season.

<P>
Gwynn will receive a general anesthetic and the compressed top joint of his 
right index finger will be snapped back in place. It's likely that a pin will 
be injected below the joint to support the bone structure, the club announced 
Monday.

The injury occurred when Gwynn ran into the outfield wall in the third inning 
of Saturday night's game at Atlanta while trying to catch a ball hit by the 
Braves' Jeff Treadway.

Gwynn finished the season hitting .309 with four home runs and 72 RBIs.

Kuwaiti athletes stood defiantly to attention and white-robed officials dried 
tears with their headdresses as the conquered nation's flag was raised today at 
the Asian Games athletes' village. 
</P>
<P>
All but 71 of the 320 Kuwaiti athletes, coaches and officials originally 
selected to go to Beijing were trapped by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of their 
desert homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Those who made it to China had something to prove. "We've come to put our flag 
high," said star soccer goalkeeper Samir Said, 27. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was ready to face Iraqis on the soccer field -- a proposal to 
exclude Iraq from the Games goes to a vote here Thursday -- Samir said: 
</P>
<P>
"We've been two times champions of Asia and won the Gulf Cup seven times. Maybe 
we're against the government of Iraq, not the people. I will play. It's a good 
chance for me to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
The red, green and white Kuwaiti flag was raised in the heart of the athletes' 
village in the presence of Sheik Ahmed Fahd al Ahmed al Sabah, new president of 
the Kuwait Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Ahmed last month took over the post from his father, Sheik Fahd, who was 
killed defending the Emir's palace from the Iraqi invaders. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four Asian Games torches carried across China in a monthlong relay 
reached Beijing. The torches were lit in the Chinese capital a month ago and 
flown to the four corners of the country, from which they were relayed back to 
Beijing by 100 million runners. 
</P>
<P>
Japan announced that it is sending Education Minister Kosuke Hori to attend the 
opening ceremony on Saturday. It will be the first Cabinet-level visit between 
the two countries since Beijing cracked down on last year's massive 
pro-democracy movement.

recently rented during a stay in the area. Court records say the victim 
reported that she continuously refused Wingate's advances while she lay heavily 
intoxicated on a bedroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
Along with second-degree rape, Wingate is charged with battery and a 
fourth-degree sexual offense.

Penthouse Publisher Bob Guccione said today that he is planning to sell his 
magazine in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Guccione said he has reached agreement with Moscow to start distributing the 
magazine in the Soviet Union within the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also has plans to distribute it in Poland, Hungary and 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
He said some high-ranking Soviet officials have private subscriptions, part of 
Penthouse's worldwide sales of nearly 4 million a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Five of the 17 bureaucrats I spoke to when I was negotiating with the Soviet 
ministry told me that they get it every month," said Guccione, who's in 
Australia to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the magazine's Australian 
edition. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought in light of perestroika the Russian male was likely to benefit 
from a lifestyle magazine like Penthouse. I naturally agreed with that."

STEVE ALLEN LASHES TV TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Veteran comedian Steve Allen doesn't find anything funny about television's 
trend toward stronger language and adult-oriented themes. 
</P>
<P>
Allen lashed out at current television trends in an opinion piece published in 
Monday's Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
The "flow is carrying us all along right into the sewer," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"The very sort of language parents forbid their children to use is now being 
encouraged not only by anything-goes cable entrepreneurs but the once 
high-minded networks," said Allen, host of the 1950s comedy-variety series "The 
Steve Allen Show." 
</P>
<P>
Shows that depict children and others using vulgar language only point up the 
collapse of the American family, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen applauded NBC's censoring of some remarks by comedian Andrew Dice Clay on 
a recent "Saturday Night Live" episode. He called Clay "the prince of filth." 
</P>
<P>
"The best humor, when it is not simply purely playful, says something witty and 
wise about the issues it confronts," Allen said.

ACTION STAR VAN DAMME WANTS TO KEEP SHIRT ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERNON SCOTT, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when filmmakers and moviegoers seem to be turning away from violent action 
pictures, along comes Jean-Claude Van Damme, a tough cookie bent on inheriting 
the collective mantle of Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Norris. 
</P>
<P>
The handsome, muscular native of Belgium is starring in "Death Warrant," not to 
be confused with "Driving Miss Daisy" or "Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
Although Van Damme is steering his career to less-bloody fare, his following is 
primarily hard-core martial arts fans and youthful females smitten with his 
biceps, trapezius muscles and pectorals. 
</P>
<P>
He looks great with a shirt on. He looks better with it off. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Death Warrant," Van Damme's pictures include "Kickboxer," 
"Bloodsport" and "Cyborg," all of which prospered at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
Awaiting release is "Lionheart." He is off soon to star in "Double Impact," in 
which he plays twins. Thereafter he will head the cast of "Universal Soldier." 
</P>
<P>
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger, another Eurohunk, Van Damme has set his sights on 
becoming a mainstream star in nonviolent films. 
</P>
<P>
Also, like Schwarzenegger, Van Damme plans to become a tycoon. "I have a long 
way to go," he said. "To build an empire you need more than muscle. You need 
strong mental powers, like Arnold has and I am trying to develop." 
</P>
<P>
Van Damme says violence in his pictures is different from the body counts in 
Chuck Norris and Sylvester Stallone films. 
</P>
<P>
"My violence is more emotional than physical," he said. "I see that lots of 
passion is included in the script. I want my character to fight more with his 
heart than his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"That way people can accept more violence from me. I think that is why my 
pictures do so well in other parts of the world. My characters fight for 
principle, not for country or money. 
</P>
<P>
"I am already changing my image in 'Double Impact' by playing twins. One of 
them is violent and the other is not, so audiences can see the contrast in my 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"This picture has comedy, romance, a love story. So it is not all action and 
fighting. I was a dancer for years. When I fight on screen, I blend karate with 
dancing. Grace plus power is very nice. 
</P>
<P>
"If I stay in martial arts pictures people will get tired of my films. . . . If 
I want a long career in motion pictures, then I have to break away from 
physical roles. Wait and see, I will do exactly that."
