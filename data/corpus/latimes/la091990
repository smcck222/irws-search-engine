Writer Ben Stein filed a lawsuit in L.A. Tuesday, claiming that a Carl's Jr. 
commercial used a schoolteacher character he created in the movie "Ferris 
Bueller's Day Off." 
</P>
<P>
Stein described the vocal style of the character in the movie as "monotonous, 
nasal, repetitive, nerdy and slightly insane. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He thinks this was the first teacher to sound that way?

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is often in the news for directing such 
exploratory missions as the current photo-shoot of Venus by the Magellan 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
But some people still have the wrong idea about JPL. They assume the Pasadena 
agency's name refers to jet aircraft, rather than to jet propulsion (the 
process by which rockets are powered). 
</P>
<P>
"A while back we got an indignant letter from a woman in Orange County," said 
George Alexander, a JPL spokesman. "She had felt a sonic boom and phoned the 
police and they told here it was probably made by a couple of jets. So she 
wrote us and said, 'You scared my dogs. Why can't you do things more quietly?'

Moving from Venusians to Venetians: A workshop on "Writing About Sex," 
scheduled to begin earlier this month, has been reset for 8 p.m. next Wednesday

</P>
<P>
Naturally, the subject of sex brings us to headaches. 
</P>
<P>
A collection of paintings, photographs and prints illustrating headaches will 
throb at the Santa Monica Public Library Oct. 1-26. 
</P>
<P>
The artists said they drew on their own personal suffering. John Crowley, for 
instance, attributed the inspiration for his painting (see photo) to a migraine 
that lasted three weeks.

STINGING MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another shock wave is going through Sacramento with the conviction of former 
state Sen. Paul Carpenter on charges of racketeering, extortion, conspiracy and 
bribery. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, a Democrat who represented Orange County before his election to the 
State Board of Equalization, follows in the muddied footsteps of state Sen. 
Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who was sent to federal prison for selling his 
vote to special interests. 
</P>
<P>
Both were targets of an FBI sting that could ensnare other legislators as well. 
</P>
<P>
The political nose dives taken by both men aren't viewed with surprise or even 
much regret in the Capitol; both legislators were known for blatantly 
pressuring contributors. 
</P>
<P>
What's sobering about their indictments is that they stepped over the line in a 
process that all successful politicians must know well: campaign fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
And money to fuel ever-more-costly elections comes mostly from those who have 
something to gain from the Legislature. As a result, elective politics has been 
drawn into an ethical quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Carpenter is a bad apple. He admitted at the trial that he gave 
special "access" to big contributors he didn't give to others. Federal 
prosecutors said this was illegal, and jurors agreed. 
</P>
<P>
In June, voters passed Proposition 112, imposing new ethical standards on 
legislators and other state officers. That should help define limits for the 
necessary evil of campaign fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
But an even stronger and more sobering message has been sent by Carpenter's 
conviction.

THE PRICE OF INDEPENDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
WHY SOUTER SEEMS HEADED FOR CONFIRMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judge David H. Souter has so far failed to inspire either widespread fear or 
passionate enthusiasm for his candidacy for the Supreme Court of the United 
States. This means, of course, that he will most likely be approved by the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, probably as soon as this week. Should final Senate 
confirmation come as quickly, and as easily, as now expected, it will be a 
tribute not only to how well this little-known New Hampshire jurist has handled 
himself at his confirmation hearings but also how well the Bush 
Administration's political operatives have handled this nomination. In every 
sense their operation has been a textbook classic of how to "work" Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with congressional elections in the fall, the Bush handlers did not want 
another Bork-barrel fiasco on their hands. So they did their homework and 
found, in Souter, a kind of Stealth candidate with a profile so low that he 
could scarcely be sighted on enemy political radar. Pro-choice and 
anti-abortion groups were lying in wait, but Souter wasn't one for walking into 
political traps. 
</P>
<P>
On one level Souter's escape from easy political characterization raises 
questions that cannot be answered until he is sitting on the High Court, at 
which point it will be too late to decide whether his answers render him 
unsuitable for the honor. Some unease also arises over Souter's socially 
reclusive bachelor lifestyle and its argued incompatibility with the broader, 
experienced compassion needed of today's High Court justice. No doubt some 
unease also stems from the persistent recollection that, as nominees, Justices 
Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy both refused to answer abortion questions -- 
and were later to emerge as strong antagonists of the pro-choice ruling Roe vs. 
Wade. Will Souter do the same? 
</P>
<P>
But please consider the risk of establishing single-issue litmus tests on 
judicial candidates. These days abortion is an issue of transcending 
importance. But 10 years from now, when Supreme Court Justice Souter, now 51, 
is still deciding cases, other issues may vie for the lead role. Moreover, the 
nation needs to value an independent judiciary in which judges decide cases on 
their merits and according to the dictates of law and conscience. Any single 
litmus test is incompatible with such independence. 
</P>
<P>
There are rarely absolute guarantees in life. So as the Senate moves to confirm 
this nomination, as it should, we can only hope that the new justice will 
decide difficult cases before him without resorting to ideology, indifference 
or intolerance. The law should be his guide, but his conscience should be, too. 
</P>
<P>
And so President Bush seems to have dodged another potential political bullet. 
But he must not push his luck. Should he face the task of nominating another 
Supreme Court justice some day, he must look farther and wider, not for a 
Stealth candidate but for a black, or a Latino, or an Asian-American, or a Jew 
or another woman. With the greatest respect for David H. Souter, who may very 
well turn out to be a superb jurist indeed, what the High Court needs most is 
more diversity, not more of the same.

CONDEMNED TO REPEAT HISTORY;

<P>
PERSIAN GULF: CALLS FOR JAPAN TO RELAX ITS CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON OFFENSIVE ARMS 
COULD INVITE A RETURN TO MILITARY BELLIGERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE FEIN and EDWIN MEESE III, Bruce Fein is a constitutional scholar in 
Washington. Former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III is a Distinguished Fellow of the 
Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fulminations from Congress and President George Bush for a muscular Japanese 
presence in the Middle East conjures up George Santayana's aphorism: "Those who 
cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." By tacitly rebuking 
Japan's constitutional ban on offensive arms or deployments as a mere pretext 
for evading its international Middle East responsibilities, the United States 
is encouraging a reprise of Japanese belligerence. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 12, the House of Representatives voted 370 to 53 to commence 
withdrawing 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan unless that nation funds 
their full $7.4-billion annual cost. The vote expressed congressional 
resentment against the diminutive Japanese contribution to enforcing 
international sanctions against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The vote prompted Japan to boost its Middle East financial assistance from $2 
billion to $4 billion, and to send medical personnel there. But Japan has 
resisted any direct military nexus with the cordon sanitaire around Iraq. It 
points to Article 9 of its 1947 Constitution, engineered by Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur, that renounces "the threat or use of force as a means of settling 
international disputes" and the maintenance of "land, sea, and air forces, as 
well as other war potential." 
</P>
<P>
A strict administration of Article 9 is indispensable to peace and stability in 
Asia and the Pacific. The United States is foolishly currying a menacing 
Japanese military juggernaut in these areas by urging a sweeping construction 
for short-sighted domestic political benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese traditions celebrate a sense of superiority over other peoples and 
international assertiveness. The 1894-95 Sino-Japanese War, the suzerainty over 
Korea from 1910 to 1945, the 1931 invasion of Manchuria and Pearl Harbor are 
illustrative. The Japanese have also eschewed a World War II peace treaty with 
the Soviet Union because of the former's territorial claims to the Kurile 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Japan generally treats its Korean population with disdain. Japanese textbooks 
repeatedly seek to gloss over the "Rape of Nanking" and mistreatment of Koreans 
during Japan's prolonged occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese culture has resisted acceptance of war guilt for World War II; Japan 
declined vigorous prosecution of officials implicated in World War II 
atrocities in domestic tribunals, and, it did not exorcise from public life all 
collaborators with World War II militarists to strengthen attachment to 
democratic norms. In sharp contrast, post-World War II West Germany undertook 
steps to reinforce unequivocal renunciation of Nazism. 
</P>
<P>
During the next decade, the United States will dramatically reduce or end its 
military presence in Japan, the Philippines and South Korea. The United States 
has already begun phasing out its 16,000 troop presence at Subic Bay Naval Base 
and Clark Air Base, and parallel reductions are scheduled in South Korea. 
Domestic demands in the United States for a balanced budget, coupled with the 
end of U.S.-Soviet military antagonisms, make such shrinking politically 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, Japanese self-defense forces, permitted under Article 9, will 
expand to counteract the U.S. shortfall. At present, Japan has the 
third-largest defense budget in the world, and possesses the technical 
sophistication and economic sinews to transform its forces into an offensive 
monster instantaneously. The Japanese political incentives for offensive 
armament are threefold: the recapture of the Kurile Islands, the domination of 
foreign nations holding resources vital to Japan's economic colossus and 
military parity with its foremost and nuclear-armed Asian rivals -- China and 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Article 9 stands as a bulwark against worrisome global influences that are 
pushing Japan toward military boldness. It is penny-wise but pound-foolish for 
the United States to urge a relaxation of it to combat the short-term gulf 
crisis. Any glib evasion around the article would threaten a precedent that 
might haunt posterity and amity throughout Asia and the Pacific.

IRAN-IRAQ: BAGHDAD SENDS IRANIAN RESISTANCE FIGHTERS HOME TO CERTAIN DEATH TO 
SECURE SUPPLIES FROM TEHRAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM O. BEEMAN, William O. Beeman is an anthropologist at Brown 
University specializing on the Middle East and a contributing editor at Pacific 
News Service. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hostage politics have taken a new and cruel twist in the gulf crisis. In 
exchange for Iranian aid, Iraq is now delivering Iranian resistance movement 
members operating in Baghdad to Iran, where they will almost certainly be 
executed. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Iranians sent back to Iran recently as prisoners of war were a number 
of members of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, commonly known as the 
People's Moujahedeen, the best-organized opposition to Iran's clerical regime 
since the revolution. When detected in Iran, moujahedeen members are regularly 
executed. Thus, Iraq's delivery of them to Iran amounts to a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's current plight must seem like an astounding stroke of good fortune in 
Tehran, especially since Iraq seems willing to pay extravagantly for help. 
</P>
<P>
And Iran is the one nation in the region unlikely to pay much attention to U.S. 
entreaties for support of the economic embargo against Iraq. Iran wants the 
United States out of the region even more than it wants Iraq out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Much more than an ideological opposition group, the moujahedeen have created an 
independent armed opposition to the Islamic leadership in Tehran. Secular and 
leftist in their political orientation, they were part of the revolution that 
overthrew the Shah in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
That year, conservative religious groups had consolidated their power 
throughout Iran. After eliminating all secular nationalists from the 
revolutionary government, the clerics began pursuing and arresting moujahedeen. 
The moujahedeen went underground. Their leaders, Massoud and Maryam Rajavi, 
eventually shifted the movement to Baghdad where they enjoyed the support of 
the Iraqi government. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to accurately gauge the success of the moujahedeen. By their 
own account they constitute a major threat to the Tehran regime, and tens of 
thousands have been executed in Iran. Their slick publicity shows thousands of 
troops -- men and women -- in continual training, and announces regular battles 
with the Iranian army in border areas. In addition, they claim to have 
guerrilla forces throughout Iran ready to lead strikes and civil disturbances. 
They operate clandestine radio stations and maintain a significant 
international network of Iranian emigres who demonstrate against the current 
government throughout the world, with emphasis on its human-rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the moujahedeen are dangerous or not, they have symbolic importance as 
the last strong organized opposition to the revolutionary government in its 
current form. 
</P>
<P>
This initial shipment of moujahedeen is likely a show of good faith on the part 
of Saddam Hussein. As Iran complies with Iraq's requests for supplies, it is 
likely that more of the moujahedeen will be sent over the border. The rate of 
their release to Iranian officials can thus be seen as a rough index of Iran's 
cooperation with Iraq in defiance of the international embargo. 
</P>
<P>
As reprehensible as these actions seem, they show the length to which both Iran 
and Iraq are willing to exploit the current Middle East crisis for their own 
benefit. They also show how difficult it will be for external powers like the 
United States to affect the political dynamics that obtain between these two 
regional powers.

WE WHO FACE THIS NIGHTMARE SEE FETAL RESEARCH IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
THERE IS NO LOGIC AND MUCH AGONY IN BANNING USE OF ABORTED TISSUE FOR RESEARCH 
ON PARKINSON'S AND OTHER DISEASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A fight begins on Capitol Hill this week over an issue that, to some, simply 
offers the latest chance to restage America's familiar moral dialogue over 
abortion. But to me -- and to several million other Americans -- it involves a 
matter of personal survival. 
</P>
<P>
After decades of research, teams in Sweden and Denver have announced the first 
successful transplants of fetal brain tissue to victims of Parkinson's disease, 
a degenerative neurological disorder. The implanted cells are thriving in the 
ailing part of the afflicted person's brain and producing a crucial 
neurochemical that the stricken brain cells had stopped supplying. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers caution that this is not yet a reliable therapy, much less a cure. 
But for those of us facing the nightmare of advanced Parkinsonism -- a lethal 
blend of rigidity, tremor and motor dysfunction, eventually robbing the ability 
to walk, eat, talk, even move -- this development is a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
And more good news will follow: Fetal tissue transplants appear to be reversing 
diabetes symptoms, and may be a possible therapy for many other chronic 
degenerative conditions. In the United States, though, this work is a political 
hostage of abortion politics. Last November, the Bush Administration extended a 
Reagan-era moratorium on federal financing of fetal tissue research because 
ituses the remains of elective abortions. Since researchers on medical 
frontiers depend heavily on government assistance, major breakthroughs that 
scientists expected are blocked by lack of funds. The Denver project subsists 
on a bequest from a philanthropist and on the fees it charges those 
volunteering as transplant candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress are seeking to lift the ban legislatively, through the 
Research Freedom Act, sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles). The bill, 
which would free such funding from political intervention, faces its first vote 
this month. And when it does, a congressional "pro-life" force is expected to 
attempt to reduce the discussion to the anti-abortion rhetoric that was used to 
justify the presidential moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's staff described his decision as a "matter of heart and of 
mind." For me, it is a matter of life. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system of regulation, American women have more than 1 million 
legal abortions each year. Since opinion polls show support for the continued 
availability of that right, we can expect that abortion will continue to be 
legal in some states (if not all) and many abortions will be performed in 
future years. Yet the President refuses to allow fetal tissue, which otherwise 
is destroyed, to save lives. Where is the logic in that? 
</P>
<P>
As for the "heart" behind the ban: I just hope members of Congress take time, 
before voting, to have their hearts touched by those of us in need of a 
scientific miracle. 
</P>
<P>
If they sit down with my parents or my husband, for example, they will know the 
chill my loved ones feel as they think about my future. There are drugs on the 
market that temporarily reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's, and a new drug may 
even retard it -- but they are only a medical finger in the dike. Eventually 
Parkinson's surges forward, leaving advancing dysfunction and death in its 
wake. 
</P>
<P>
For me, that -- never mind my career, or my new marriage or my dreams of having 
children -- is the future. The millions of other Americans afflicted with 
Parkinson's, diabetes and the other diseases have their own stories of 
unrealized dreams; of watching their bodies fail them, and being unable to do 
anything to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the President feels morally entitled to close his heart to us. Since 
abortion is wrong, he reasons, no benefit should result, even if it would save 
a life. But punishing me for another's moral choice -- a choice that will be 
made anyway -- doesn't even out the equation. It just harms more people. 
</P>
<P>
The Swedes don't mix the issues. They regulate abortions, and then allow the 
remains to be used to help people. 
</P>
<P>
And consider the French: They have just announced successful use of fetal 
tissue transplants to living fetuses still in the womb that treated those tiny 
new lives for inherited diseases before their birth. 
</P>
<P>
Shouldn't we encourage such miracles? How can it be "pro-life" to stop them? 
Those are questions my family and I have for the members of Congress. And there 
is one more. 
</P>
<P>
Someday, the work of the Swedes, the French and underfunded U.S. researchers 
will reach and help Americans. At the current pace of research, that "someday" 
may be far away. In the meantime, the disease will continue its quiet violence. 
So I wonder, will this plodding rescue effort reach me in time?

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
A FRIENDLY FACE FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fighting crime is never an easy job, but it's much more difficult in Orange 
County's Southeast-Asian community. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents fear the very law-enforcement officers sworn to protect them; 
their memories of corrupt and cruel police in their homelands are bitter. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of this fear, and also because of language problems, recruitment 
of Southeast-Asian law-enforcement officers is extremely difficult. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Sheriff's Department has no Southeast-Asian officers on 
patrol, although several are rising up the ranks. Santa Ana's Police Department 
has done a little better -- it reports having seven Vietnamese officers on the 
beat. Other police departments have few or none, and the problem may take years 
to correct. In the meantime, gang-related crimes are on the upswing in 
communities where Southeast-Asian immigrants have settled. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Orange County Human Relations Commission and the U.S. Justice 
Department took a commendable step when they brought together about 200 
law-enforcement officers, government officials and civic leaders to exchange 
ideas on ways to overcome cultural barriers between the police and the 
community. The conference was held in Garden Grove's Little Saigon -- the heart 
of the Southeast-Asian community. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the good suggestions -- police substations, anonymous hot lines, 
bilingual programs, Asian advisory committees and special liaisons who keep in 
regular contact with business owners -- will be included in a report to the 
Justice Department for distribution throughout the nation. Some already have 
been put into action in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 Times poll indicated that Southeast Asians overwhelmingly consider gangs 
and violent crime their biggest problem in Orange County. It will take awhile, 
but last week's conference shows that law enforcement is looking for new ways 
to address the problem, which is what is needed and the sooner the better.

* Beloved Prize: American author Toni Morrison's novel "Beloved" won the 
Chianti Ruffino Antico Fattore international literary prize Sunday in Florence, 
Italy. Award sponsors praised the novel for "giving a voice to the experience 
of suffering, survival and life of the black population of America and in 
giving a voice to the feminine experience within the black population." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison was selected from among winners of other national literary prizes.

* Naval Blockade: The Australian sailors in the Persian Gulf are complaining 
because they do not receive pornographic videotapes sent to them. Defense 
Support Minister Gordon Bilney told Parliament Monday in Sydney: "Those Middle 
East countries have very strict regulations as regards the importation of 
pornographic material." Australia has two frigates and a supply ship in the 
gulf. A spokesman for a Canberra adult video mail order firm said Tuesday naval 
bases were "some of our best clients."

* Back Again: Hoover-Ball, a game invented to help President Herbert Hoover 
stay in shape, is returning to the nation's capital after a 57-year absence. 
Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) is sponsoring a Hoover-Ball Capital Classic on 
Sept. 29 in Washington, D.C. In the game, two three-player teams heave a 
6-pound medicine ball over an 8-foot volleyball net. 
</P>
<P>
* Eat It Up: Mr. Olympia Lee Haney, crowned Saturday in Chicago for the seventh 
consecutive time, says he stays in shape by eating, eating, eating -- the right 
foods. Haney, 30, estimates he gobbles up 4,000 to 5,000 calories a day, 65 to 
70% of them carbohydrates. "But most people have bacon or sausage in the 
morning, a burger for lunch, and before they know it, they have a lot of body 
fat," he said. Haney's latest crown eclipsed the record of six consecutive 
titles of actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. YEMI TOURE

JOURNEY REDISCOVERS FAMILY'S GOLDEN AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Forgive me, but I confess that I was prepared to enjoy "When the World Was 
Whole" from the moment that I glanced at the author's photograph on the dust 
jacket. His sly smile, the gleam in his eyes, and even the lines on his 
careworn face hold out the promise of worldly-wise good humor and tales well 
told. And when I read Charles Fenyvesi's marvelous stories of Jewish life in 
Hungary in bygone times, I discovered that my intuition was wholly correct. 
</P>
<P>
Born in a small town in Hungary in 1937, Fenyvesi and his parents managed to 
survive the Holocaust on forged papers, and he reached the United States only 
after the Hungarian uprising of 1956. (Today, Fenyvesi is a garden columnist 
and a journalist at U. S. News &amp; World Report.) The world that Fenyvesi 
knew as a child -- and, tragically, most of the people who inhabited that world 
-- were doomed to utter destruction. All that remains are memories; but in 
Fenyvesi's hands, the memories turn out to be a rich legacy indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"When the World Was Whole" opens with Fenyvesi's journey of discovery to the 
towns and villages of Hungary and Transylvania where his ancestors lived and 
worked for more than four centuries. Soon enough, however, Fenyvesi falls under 
the spell of the stories that he heard as a young child, ranging from the 
legends of the Baal Shem Tov to the commonplaces of his own family history. 
Suddenly, we are aloft on a magic carpet, floating back and forth from our own 
benighted times to what Fenyvesi calls "a golden age that now seems farther 
away than the heavens." 
</P>
<P>
We are introduced to the ghosts of the patriarchs and matriarchs of Fenyvesi's 
family; we are witness to their most intimate dreams and longings, their 
darkest secrets and deepest tragedies. And, once we have come to know them and 
understand why Fenyvesi loves them so, we are confronted with their terrible 
fates. "When the World Was Whole" is emblematic of Jewish storytelling in the 
20th Century -- the dreamer of the golden dream awakes in Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
But Fenyvesi's book is hardly a dirge; rather, it is an unabashed (and 
unashamedly sentimental) celebration of a world of grace and beauty, a world of 
order and balance. Each vivid character in Fenyvesi's stories somehow ennobles 
and enriches the lives of others. We meet a wonder-working rabbi who believes 
in the curative power of songs and dreams; a strange, obsessed nobleman ("I am 
myself a ghost") who bestows wealth and power on a humble Jewish man; a drunken 
coachman whose failings are eclipsed by the gift of song: "When this coachman 
sings, the angels start to sing." 
</P>
<P>
The bounties of the soil amount to a persistent theme in "When the World Was 
Whole," and Fenyvesi's rich prose is redolent of worked earth. His ancestors 
were farming the hinterlands of Hungary and Transylvania when it was still 
illegal for Jews to own land and he traces the rise and fall of his family 
according to its tenure on the land. For Fenyvesi, the fruits of the earth are 
a philosopher's stone of enduring value, and a metaphor for the fate of 
humankind. 
</P>
<P>
"I pick up a walnut from the ground," he writes of a visit to the scene of his 
family's former glories in eastern Hungary. "Its soft husk is half green, full 
of live tissue, and half black and dead, and I hear myself muttering the 
opening words of the Kaddish, the Hebrew prayer for the dead that does not once 
mention dying or death or the dead, but which helps the soul free itself from 
the body and rise to a higher sphere." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there is a dangerous edge to Fenyvesi's reverie. The order and 
balance that he describes so lyrically and so longingly were a cruel illusion, 
and even the most exalted, kind and beautiful people in his tales were destined 
to suffer the very worst fate that the human imagination was able to conceive. 
And he is not afraid to ask out loud: Why did the family forfeit its blessings 
and fall from grace? 
</P>
<P>
The question has no answer. The very act of retelling these stories, Fenyvesi 
insists, is a powerful ritual of redemption. 
</P>
<P>
"We can still recapture bits and pieces from a world that was once whole, in 
which lives were aligned in secret symmetries, one good deed invoked another, 
and a gift from heaven passed from one generation to another," he explains. 
"Telling stories about such a world helps restore it, and the storyteller 
prescribes a miracle each time he recalls an instance of heaven bending to a 
human being with a pure heart and a soul on fire."

A LAMB GOES TO HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: DAVID MCFADZEAN, WHO BEGAN HIS CAREER WITH THE LAMB'S PLAYERS IN 
NATIONAL CITY, HAS GONE ON TO WRITE FOR TWO PRIME-TIME TELEVISION COMEDIES.

<TEXT>
<P>
David McFadzean has two openings this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Carol &amp; Company," the new Carol Burnett comedy series that he co-created 
and co-produces with "Roseanne" creator Matt Williams, starts its second season 
at 10 p.m. Saturday on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the return engagement of the Lamb's Players Theatre's 1983 
production of "Damien," which McFadzean directed. This one-man show based on 
the historical Father Damien DeVeuster, a priest who devoted his life to caring 
for lepers, opens tonight at the Lyceum Space. 
</P>
<P>
If the two shows represent a vast range of interests, McFadzean likes it that 
way. He began his professional writing and directing career in 1979 as a staff 
member of National City's Lamb's Players Theatre, a self-described Christian 
theater troupe. He stayed with Lamb's until 1985, when he left to teach 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
He has become known in Hollywood, however, as a television comedy writer, a 
career which he began by writing for "Roseanne" in 1987 at the invitation of 
Williams, his college roommate. 
</P>
<P>
Both aspects of his career remain important to him, he said on the phone from 
his Burbank office. "I believe you need to create three-dimensional Christian 
characters, Buddhist or atheist characters," he said. "They are not always 
going to say what you want them to say. But you have to serve all of them by 
giving them a strong heart to say what they have to say." 
</P>
<P>
McFadzean said he has found satisfaction in "Carol &amp; Company" and 
"Roseanne" -- well, at least in the first 12 episodes of Roseanne Barr's show, 
before she fired producer and creator Matt Williams. 
</P>
<P>
McFadzean left the show with the rest of the writing staff at the end of the 
first year. He alternately describes the experience as his "trial by fire," his 
"prison sentence" and his "lovely 'Roseanne' period," a phrase he repeats with 
heavy sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
"When you watch the first 12 episodes, you can see that there is more love and 
concern expressed about working out what it means to be a family than there is 
in other family sitcoms," he said. "She (Barr) was always acerbic, but you 
always knew she had her family at heart and there was a good strong 
relationship between her and her husband. There were good family values, but 
with an edge." 
</P>
<P>
After he left the program, McFadzean servered all ties with the show. "I don't 
watch it anymore," he said. "But then, I don't watch much television." 
</P>
<P>
As for "Carol &amp; Company," the constantly changing format allows McFadzean 
to 
</P>
<P>
write small plays every week. Recently he was even able to work in a sketch 
with a good angel/bad angel routine. 
</P>
<P>
But he hopes people won't expect him to be injecting religious doctrine in his 
writing. He has his beliefs, but more and more he finds his range of subject 
matter widening. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my friends understand that I don't call all the shots," McFadzean 
said. "Sometimes they're surprised at what I think is very good." 
</P>
<P>
Despite McFadzean's big-time successes, the connection to Lamb's Theatre is one 
he values and hopes to continue. He has already written about half a dozen 
plays for Lamb's, including "Deep River," which was later produced 
off-Broadway, and the award-winning "Oklahoma Rigs." It was after seeing 
"Oklahoma Rigs" that Williams asked him to move to Hollywood and write for 
"Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think, for a writer, I could have a better situation to create 
things," he said of the Lamb's Players. "They know my mind because I was with 
them for so long and I love it. Their esthetics are wonderful for a small 
theater. They always show me something that isn't there and they cover the 
problems in the script so well that you think it's better than it is." 
</P>
<P>
McFadzean returns the favor by directing "Damien." 
</P>
<P>
What attracted him to "Damien," he said, was playwright Aldyth Morris' 
portrayal of Damien as a difficult man rather than as a plastic saint. While it 
shows him as an imperfect man, it also shows the heights that such an imperfect 
man can attain. 
</P>
<P>
"For me it is such a fair representation of what it is to be a Christian in all 
of its strengths and weaknesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not sanitized. He's got an angry side as well as a loving side and a 
compassionate side. He's got lust. And yet you come out thinking that this is a 
man to reckon with spiritually. This is a man who knows how to love and to love 
greatly. But it's not without pain. In 'Damien,' the story shows that, even 
when you commit yourself to God, it's a difficult life to live." 
</P>
<P>
McFadzean, who describes himself as a devout Christian, expresses little 
patience for the way many Christian troupes "tend to sanitize things." 
</P>
<P>
That is something that he feels Lamb's has not been guilty of. 
</P>
<P>
"Oftentimes, Christian theater groups do 'Oklahoma,' 'The Sound of Music' and 
original pieces that are only industrial shows for Christians," he said. "That 
doesn't mean that they are bad or wrong, but they don't have the artistic or 
literary depth that you need to challenge artists with. 
</P>
<P>
"As a Christian, being able to go into a Christian performing arts company and 
do Shakespeare was very attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, McFadzean's theatrical career began with the kind of Christian 
shows he now rejects. He started writing Bible dramas in the mid-'70s soon 
after he and his wife, Elizabeth, were converted to a Pentecostal religious 
belief by the high school principal and the guidance counselor in a school 
where both were teaching. They left the school and began touring the country 
with shows that McFadzean wrote. 
</P>
<P>
After a few years of that, McFadzean knew he "didn't want to get caught up in 
doing only ministry work. I also wanted a chance to direct mainstream plays." 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife applied to Lamb's and were accepted. McFadzean didn't care for 
acting, so Lamb's Artistic Director Robert Smyth encouraged him to write. 
McFadzean's first full-length play was an adaptation of Victor Hugo's "The 
Hunchback of Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
"It was way too long, but I felt there was real potential there and we produced 
it," Smyth recalled. "After that we thought, 'Let's try it again.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing to watch him blossom," Smyth said. "I think he really 
understands character and the heart of what motivates people." 
</P>
<P>
McFadzean stayed with Lamb's until 1984, when he left to teach in the theater 
department at Judson College in Elgin, Ill. After moving back to Southern 
California in 1988, he renewed his relationship with Lamb's. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote another family drama, "Kilts," during his stint at "Roseanne." It was 
produced at Lamb's two years ago under Smyth's direction of Lamb's artistic 
director Robert Smyth. And they are talking about a sequel to the show, "Blue 
Moon." 
</P>
<P>
McFadzean was also instrumental in getting Lamb's the West Coast premiere of 
"Johnny Pye and the Foolkiller," a new musical that will open Oct. 5 at Lamb's 
home in National City. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly three years in Hollywood, however, McFadzean said he still doesn't 
understand why movies dwell on what he refers to as "evil" rather than good. 
</P>
<P>
"Movies like 'Ghost' and 'Halloween 15' depict blood lust and excitement. And 
there is a truth to the evil dimension they represent. You should be scared," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But why don't we buy the truth of the spirit of the good dimension? We buy the 
evil, but not the good and I don't know why that is." 
</P>
<P>
The play "Damien," by contrast, accomplishes exactly what McFadzean believes a 
good play should. Evil, which is represented by leprosy, remains terrifying and 
yet there is a theme of redemption and hope. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is healed. The leprosy is horrific. The evil is not made palatable," 
McFadzean said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the victory here comes from persistence and sacrifice and love. That was 
why the play was very attractive to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Damien" opens tonight at the Lyceum Space. On Tuesday, Lamb's will present a 
benefit performance of "Damien" for the AIDS Chaplaincy Program and Hope 
Ministries of San Diego, two organizations working directly with AIDS patients 
and their families and friends.

AT SANTA ANA'S CRAZY HORSE SALOON, THE ALL-WOMAN COUNTRY BAND SHOWS THAT HONEST 
CRAFT IS BEHIND ITS APPEAL.

<P>
As the only all-female country band signed to a major label, Wild Rose has a 
handy hook to grab media interest. But that hook must also seem a thorn at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the attention the group gets focuses on the rarity of five women 
playing country music; other reports take the "they-play-real-good-for-girls" 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
But the simple fact is, there are few bands of any chromosomal predisposition 
in country today that Wild Rose couldn't smoke with their own pipes. 
</P>
<P>
In its early show at the Crazy Horse on Monday, the quintet showed it belongs 
among that select group of younger performers that is keeping country's 
musicianship and passion alive. With most of its members strongly grounded in 
bluegrass, the band seemed somewhat akin to the recently disbanded New Grass 
Revival in its musical ability and abandon. And it didn't take a horticulturist 
to see that Wild Rose and the Desert Rose Band belong to the same genus of 
singular, honest craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
The group is led by Wanda Vick, who is a true wonder on guitar, fiddle, dobro 
and pedal steel. The front-line singing is provided by Pamela Gadd and Pam 
Perry, either of whom could easily get by on singing alone. But Gadd also is 
formidable on guitar and banjo, while Perry plays an inspired mandolin. Both 
previously played with the bluegrass New Coon Creek Girls. The group is ably 
completed by bassist Kathy Mac and drummer Nancy Given Prout. 
</P>
<P>
The group's instrumental chops were put to the test on the Western 
swing-inflected "Go Down Swingin,' " given a lyrical jazz violin solo by Vick, 
with its second half impeccably doubled by Gadd's guitar. The band's signature 
"Wild Rose" breakneck instrumental found the members hurtling across musical 
borders, mixing bluegrass with progressive jazz. 
</P>
<P>
For all the instrumental rampage the outfit unleashed on such showcase numbers, 
the five also nimbly reined those wild talents to serve their songs, drawn from 
their debut "Breaking New Ground" album from early this year and the 
forthcoming "Straight and Narrow" album. 
</P>
<P>
The Perry-penned "Teach Me How to Say Goodbye" and Paul Kramer's "Where Did We 
Go Wrong?" were each given an emotional ballad treatment, with Vick's 
atmospheric pedal steel setting the mood for the latter. Her fiddle bow dipped 
into some Cajun spices for "On the Bayou." The new single "Everything He 
Touches (Turns to Gold)" was as celebratory and ebullient a bit of country rock 
as has ever appeared on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
Wild Rose's only debit is that not all the material is as worthy of the band's 
talents. A pair of Skip Ewing songs from the new album, "Can't You Just Stay 
Gone" and "Rock-a-Bye Heart," were slick constructions on which the band seemed 
unable to get an emotional foothold. 
</P>
<P>
The band probably could have benefited from a more dramatically structured set 
-- when the musicians finished, there was the impression of having just seen a 
bunch of songs rather than a complete "show." But there was a beneficial 
trade-off: The easygoing stage manner seemed delightfully unaffected, a rarity 
amid country's typical show-biz gloss. And one had to love the band's cornball 
humor, such as Gadd remarking, "Your hair looks really good tonight, Wanda -- 
especially on your legs."

Much of the charm in "It's Garry Shandling's Show" came from its anarchic 
viewpoint -- Shandling, with the barely suppressed glee of a prankster on a 
long leash, tweaked television conventions offhandedly. 
</P>
<P>
Since the sitcom-that-wasn't-a-sitcom went off the air in April, Shandling has 
been planning his next move, which will include a television special at some 
point. As preparation, he's refining his stand-up act, trying out material and 
finding out what works. At the Improv Monday night, where he continues through 
Thursday, Shandling even took notes when a joke clicked or inspiration hit him. 
</P>
<P>
Shandling also kept reminding the audience that he's been away from the 
microphone a long time. "Don't feel pressure to laugh," he said, then pretended 
he was in the crowd, "I didn't know we'd be paying to give him therapy." 
</P>
<P>
His hiatus was pretty obvious, at least early on when his long and often funny 
set sputtered as he searched for a comfortable rhythm. Shandling never did find 
full balance, but he was amusing as usual with his troubled little tales about 
life in the Shandling zone. 
</P>
<P>
One problem he faces is being compared to "It's Garry Shandling's Show," 
especially the program's quirkier side. Certainly some fans came in search of 
the Shandling persona -- the self-effacing, self-absorbed guy who elevated 
fretting (about his hair and nearly everything else) to something approaching 
meditation. It may have been unfair to expect those blasts of rarefied air at 
the Improv -- you can't do the same things in a nightclub you can do in a 
television studio -- but there were times when more invention would have 
carried him higher. 
</P>
<P>
Shandling may have felt restrained by the venue. In any event, it was a pretty 
safe set that stayed well within the chalk marks of stand-up comedy. It also 
seemed just what he billed it as: part testing of waters and part well-honed 
routines that he is obviously confident about. 
</P>
<P>
At his best, Shandling can draw an audience into his world with deft asides and 
revealing looks at how he thinks and operates. His anecdotes usually combine 
the spin of someone who sees things differently than most of us with the 
mundane observations that we can relate to more directly. 
</P>
<P>
These components popped up throughout the set's better patches, such as when he 
talked about becoming pals (and even comedy partners) with President Bush 
("He's really warm, like your 'Uncle Bush.' ") Bush takes Garry on a personal 
tour of the White House and points out the original Gettysburg Address. 
"There's neat stuff like this all over the place," Bush tells him. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after their comedy routine at a press-club dinner is a success, Bush 
calls him at the hotel, waking him from a deep sleep. Garry grudgingly accepts 
the call and Bush's congratulations on a great show. But before hanging up, he 
can't resist yelling, "Are you gonna call Mikhail Gorbachev and wake him up 
too?" 
</P>
<P>
Before that, Shandling talked about his trip to Hawaii with a dog-loving 
girlfriend. It was all going so nicely until they decided to take a drive out 
in the country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
See, they were out in this beautiful field and then he was running away from a 
bull, clutching a stray dog named "Shep" under his arm, when he fell in a hole 
and broke his leg. . . . Eventually that stray dog makes his way to Garry's 
condo in the Valley and gets along great with his golden retriever but it's so 
hot one day that the retriever catches on fire and Garry wonders if he should 
light the cat as a "backfire" but. . . . Well, it's a really long story. 
</P>
<P>
Uh-huh. And what were you saying about your hair? 
</P>
<P>
 Garry Shandling will perform today and Thursday at 8:30 p.m. at the Improv, 
4255 Campus Drive, Irvine. Tickets: sold out. Information: (714) 854-5455.

Madonna's Money: Apparently, the Material Girl isn't all that concerned with 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna was listed in a recent New York newspaper ad trying to notify people 
who have $50 or more in accounts that have been dormant for five years at 
Chemical Bank. The notice listed her as Madonna Ciccone of 1775 Broadway and 
she has until Oct. 20 to claim the money. After that, the bank turns the money 
over to the state. Earlier this week, Forbes magazine included Madonna on its 
list of the top 40 wealthiest entertainers, estimating her fortune at $62 
million. BETH KLEID

FDR BIOGRAPHY IS AMONG 6 TIMES BOOK PRIZE WINNERS; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: IRELAND'S EDNA O'BRIEN TAKES THE FICTION AWARD. THE LATE O. B. HARDISON 
JR. WINS IN THE CURRENT INTEREST CATEGORY. 
</P>

A biography that portrays Franklin Delano Roosevelt as a "consummate actor" and 
an examination of how technology has affected human values were among six books 
named Tuesday as winners of the 1990 Los Angeles Times Book Prizes. 
</P>
<P>
At a reception for publishers in New York, Times Book Editor Jack Miles 
announced that Geoffrey C. Ward, author of "A First-Class Temperament: The 
Emergence of Franklin Roosevelt," had won the biography award and O. B. 
Hardison Jr., author of "Disappearing Through the Skylight: Culture and 
Technology in the Twentieth Century," was being honored posthumously as the 
recipient of the current interest prize. Each prize carries a $1,000 cash award 
and a copy of the winning book hand-bound in leather. 
</P>
<P>
Irish novelist Edna O'Brien won the fiction award for "Lantern Slides," a 
collection of short stories exploring themes of loneliness and loss set in 
Ireland, Italy and London, where the writer has lived for the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing "Lantern Slides" for The Times, Elaine Kendall said the collection -- 
the author's sixth -- represents "the essential O'Brien; completely Irish, 
absolutely universal, the wit and anguish in exquisite equilibrium." O'Brien 
has also written 10 novels and several screenplays. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of the history prize was Richard Fletcher, author of "The Quest for El 
Cid," a study of Rodrigo Diaz, the 11th Century aristocrat-warrior who became 
Spain's first national hero. Demythologizing his subject, Fletcher, who teaches 
at the University of York in England, depicts him as an ingenious soldier of 
fortune who used whatever means were necessary to achieve his goals. 
</P>
<P>
In the category of science and technology, Jane S. Smith was honored for 
"Patenting the Sun: Polio and the Salk Vaccine," a social history of the 
epidemic that frightened American parents in the 1950s and the scientific 
discovery that ended their fear. Smith, author of a biography of Elsie de 
Wolfe, the interior decorator, lives in Evanston, Ill. She was one of 2 million 
schoolchildren who participated in trials for the Salk vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
John Caddy received the poetry prize for "The Color of Mesabi Bones," a 
collection of autobiographical poems that describe his suffering at the hands 
of an abusive father. The poems are set in the Mesabi mountain range in 
northeastern Minnesota. Caddy teaches at Hamline University in St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Winning authors will be honored at a reception at The Times building on Nov. 2, 
when the winner of the Robert Kirsch Award will be announced. That award, named 
for The Times' late book critic, recognizes a writer who has lived in the West 
or made it the focus of his or her work. 
</P>
<P>
"A First-Class Temperament" is the second volume of Ward's psychologically 
illuminating biography of Roosevelt. Beginning with Roosevelt's marriage in 
1905, the author tracks him through his fledgling legal career to his election 
as governor of New York and argues that the future president's acting skills 
enabled him to cope with the effects of infantile paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
A former editor of Audience and American Heritage magazines, Ward is co-author 
of "The Civil War," the documentary series to be aired on PBS next week. He 
lives in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt biographer Arthur Schlesinger Jr. has written that Ward's effort 
"splendidly illuminates the springs of FDR's political genius." The book's 
title is drawn from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' famous remark after meeting 
Roosevelt in 1933: "A second-class intellect. But a first-class temperament." 
</P>
<P>
Hardison, who died of cancer on Aug. 5 at age 61, was a professor of English at 
Georgetown University who wrote many books of cultural criticism. In his last 
book, he traced this century's major technological developments and looked at 
how they have fundamentally altered basic concepts of nature, history, 
language, art and human evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Author James Dickey has described Hardison's work as "lively, provocative and 
often profound. If I were to characterize the general feel of his writing I 
would call it 'scholarship on fire.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Times has awarded book prizes since 1980. Winners are selected by six 
committees of three judges each. None of the judges are Times employees.

ZOO CHIEF'S SPECIAL BANK ACCOUNT PROBED; 
</P>
<P>
AUDIT: IT APPARENTLY WAS ESTABLISHED AND CONTROLLED BY THE DIRECTOR WITHOUT THE 
KNOWLEDGE OF HIS SUPERIORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Auditors are examining a special account set up and controlled by Los Angeles 
Zoo Director Warren Thomas, apparently without the knowledge of his superiors 
in the Department of Recreation and Parks, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The account was established in part with miscellaneous fees that film companies 
and others paid for use of the zoo, according to a source familiar with the 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
On a number of occasions, Thomas apparently instructed people paying the fees 
to write two checks instead of one, then he would deposit half with the city 
and half in the special account, said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when a pet food manufacturer used the zoo, the promotional fee 
would be split between the accounts, the source said, as would fees from film 
companies that rented zoo grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The account has been the subject of an inquiry since June, when city officials 
learned of its existence. The audit is designed to determine the sources of the 
money, how much was in the account, how it was spent and whether the use of the 
account violated city accounting regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the existence of the special account, Thomas said, "I have 
absolutely nothing to say." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Greater Los Angeles Area Zoo Assn., which held the account, 
said that Thomas withdrew money for various zoo projects and for one recent 
trip. They said they have no reason to believe any of the money was misspent. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Recreation and Parks Department on June 14, Deputy Mayor 
Mark Fabiani said the possible existence of such a fund "raises serious 
questions" and asked that auditors report the results to the mayor's office. 
The audit is expected to be completed this week. 
</P>
<P>
James E. Hadaway, general manager of the Department of Recreation and Parks, 
refused to discuss the audit Tuesday, but said Thomas is being investigated in 
connection with unanswered complaints about the zoo from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture as well as for another matter. 
</P>
<P>
Hadaway said he may decide as early as today whether to initiate disciplinary 
action against Thomas in the two matters. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said this week that they are particularly wary about discussing 
Thomas because he sued the city in 1986 after he was fired for a number of 
alleged irregularities. Thomas was reinstated in the job by a federal judge who 
ruled that the firing had been improper. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last week that the Griffith Park facility had been cited 
repeatedly by USDA inspectors for more than three years for inadequate food 
storage, sanitation and drainage problems, pest and rodent contamination, 
inadequate housing, run-down animal barns, and other alleged violations of 
federal regulations. Thomas did not reply to a letter sent to him nearly a year 
ago by the USDA demanding an immediate response. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Thomas said he had been unaware of the problems, but has begun a 
crash program and has addressed many of them. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Zoo Emergency Fund was set up in the mid-1980s at Thomas' request 
through the Greater Los Angeles Area Zoo Assn., according to Thomas R. 
Tellefsen, chairman of the group's executive board. Tellefsen confirmed that 
the nonprofit group that helps run the zoo maintained the account for Thomas, 
who deposited and spent the money without oversight from the city or the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
"Warren asked that this fund be available through GLAZA books in order to deal 
with emergencies," Tellefsen said. "Warren would tell GLAZA what to cut a check 
for and the amount and GLAZA would do it" 
</P>
<P>
The staff "assumed this had all been authorized by the city," Tellefsen said, 
adding that Thomas was the association's liaison with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas deposited an unknown amount of money in the account over the years and 
had sole control over it, Tellefsen said. Thomas has made only one cash 
withdrawal, a recent advance to pay for an overseas trip, said Tellefsen, who 
declined to give other details of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
On other occasions, Thomas ordered checks written to pay for various projects 
around the zoo, Tellefsen said. 
</P>
<P>
The association has been cooperating with the city inquiry and has turned over 
all records of the account, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The account came to light several months ago when a parks department official 
happened to ask a GLAZA staffer how Thomas planned to pay for one of his trips, 
Tellefsen said. 
</P>
<P>
The GLAZA staffer then mentioned the Zoo Emergency Fund, Tellefsen said. 
"That's when the department said, 'What's the Zoo Emergency Fund?' " 
</P>
<P>
Tellefsen added: "There's no griping on GLAZA's part. . . . We've been totally 
open." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the emergency fund, Tellefsen said, GLAZA allocates funds each 
year to pay for trips by Thomas. Normally, he said, such trips were approved in 
advance by the GLAZA board, which then appropriated money from GLAZA accounts.

JURY GETS AN ISSUE TO SINK ITS TEETH INTO; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: VERDICT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER A STREET FOOD VENDOR CAN CONTINUE TO 
SLATHER CHILI AND ONIONS OVER HIS HOT DOGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We put it to you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury: Are chili and onions 
condiments, or are they not? 
</P>
<P>
On such points of law and lunch turns the verdict in the trial of a hot dog 
vendor charged with health code violations for ladling out chili and chopping 
fresh onions for his customers. 
</P>
<P>
Case No. 90R13905, People vs. Michael Mikhail, went to the jury Tuesday after a 
weeklong misdemeanor trial conducted with as much solemnity -- and expense -- 
as for a murder; right down to a roster of witnesses who, in this case, spoke 
knowingly of retail food vehicles, approved commissaries and Mikhail's Tasty 
Hasty Dogs. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney hauled Mikhail in from his Mid-Wilshire lunch route in June, 
after health inspectors observed him on several occasions chopping and grilling 
onions, slathering steaming chili on hot dogs, and leaving the lids off his 
containers during busy times. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether such fixings -- "to wit: chili (and) onions," according to 
the official complaint -- are potentially hazardous and illegal, because they 
were not prepackaged at an approved facility, are not on the list of unpackaged 
foods that may be sold from carts, and were not properly protected from 
possible contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Said Deputy Public Defender Upinder Kalra: "The defense position is that chili 
is a condiment and not potentially hazardous at (a temperature of) 140 
degrees." Ditto for chopped onions. 
</P>
<P>
"Hot dogs and onions go together," he said in an impassioned closing argument. 
"They're made to go together." And chili? "We're not talking about any chili, 
we're talking about Mr. Mikhail's chili." 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate his argument in court, Kalra ripped the foil from a sizzling hot 
dog smothered in onions and continued talking with the "evidence" in hand; the 
noon hour was approaching, and jurors' heads followed his gestures as the scent 
wafted through the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Health inspectors, he concluded, abused their discretion in enforcing a vague 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Jackie Mason insisted that the law protects consumers. It 
doesn't matter, she told jurors, "if 1,000 people eat these hot dogs and don't 
get sick; it's the potential for food poisoning." Opening and heating a can of 
chili, she said, is "not OK"; chili must be in sealed, serving-sized 
containers. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like we're splitting hairs but we're not," she said, a bit 
apologetically. Like someone ticketed for speeding, Mikhail's alleged 
violations are "fairly common," she conceded later. "But a lot of people plead 
out or resolve the problem at an administrative hearing by the Health 
Department once they're cited. It seldom goes this far." 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail, a 58-year-old Egyptian immigrant who saved up $5,000 to buy the cart 
four years ago, is a scrapper whose troubles with health inspectors date to 
1987, when the same health inspector who testified against him last week fired 
the first volley. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Wagner, head of the county Health Department's division of food vehicle 
inspection, dumped bleach on Mikhail's hot dogs, relish, chili, cheese and 
sauerkraut, a technique used to "denature" questionable food. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, Mikhail says, he has been a target. His cart, which he parks in 
front of the Paramount Building on Wilshire Boulevard -- you can tell his from 
the others because it flies an American flag -- has attracted a loyal 
following. 
</P>
<P>
It has also attracted persistent health inspectors, unmoved by Mikhail shaking 
his copy of the state Health and Safety Code at them, or by the protests 
vendors have mounted against what they consider unfair policies. 
</P>
<P>
He may have scored a point. Los Angeles Municipal Judge David S. Milton 
dismissed five of the original 11 charges against Mikhail last week after the 
court clerk, bailiff and reporter told the judge that a health inspector seated 
at the back of the courtroom was signaling answers to the inspector who was 
testifying. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the remaining six garnish charges, Mikhail faces a maximum 
penalty of three years behind bars and a fine of $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail is optimistic. "When I win," he said, "I will kiss the ground and fly a 
big American flag." Selling and eating a hot dog, he said, is, well, an act of 
patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
"The American people, they have pride in them. Italy has pizza. Japan has 
sushi. And we have the hot dog."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEEN ARRESTED IN KILLING OF WOMAN, 68, IN 
DRIVE-BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies on Tuesday arrested a Los Angeles teen-ager suspected of 
fatally shooting a 68-year-old woman during a drive-by as she sat on the front 
porch of her Walnut Park home with her granddaughter in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Bell, 19, was taken into custody at his home by deputies investigating 
the Aug. 16 shooting of Anna Owens, who was hit in the chest by a stray bullet 
while she held her 9-month-old granddaughter, said Sheriff's Department 
spokesman Rich Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
Owens' granddaughter was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
An assault rifle and a handgun were also recovered during the arrest, but 
Erickson said investigators are unsure if either of the guns was used to kill 
Owens. 
</P>
<P>
Bell was booked on suspicion of murder and was being held without bail.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FEDERAL HEARINGS OPEN ON MALATHION'S SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters and opponents of malathion spraying testified Tuesday in the first 
federal hearing in Southern California on the environmental safety of the 
Mediterranean fruit fly eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agriculture officials said the hearing, held in Los Angeles, is the 
first step in a comprehensive two-year environmental review of current 
eradication methods and alternative strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Michael T. Werner, a deputy director of the U.S. Department of Food and 
Agriculture, said the review will include an evaluation of health effects of 
malathion spraying, effectiveness of the aerial spraying and alternative 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pasadena Municipal Judge Judson Morris Jr. ruled unconstitutional a 
Pasadena ordinance that had outlawed the state's malathion helicopters by 
banning low-altitude formation flying.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. OFFICIALS URGE BOEING TO HIRE LOCAL 
WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council and the county Board of Supervisors on Tuesday 
called on the Boeing Co. to hire local workers for B-2 Stealth bomber jobs in 
Palmdale instead of importing about 450 employees from Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
In separate unanimous decisions, the two governing bodies asserted that the Los 
Angeles area has a large pool of qualified and available aerospace workers, so 
the Seattle-based company need not maintain its $10 million-a-year, 
government-funded practice of temporarily relocating its employees. 
</P>
<P>
The two votes added to criticism of the program -- in which Boeing pays $25,000 
to $50,000 per employee in annual per diem expenses in addition to salaries -- 
already voiced by several elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
In a response issued Tuesday, Boeing Executive Vice President Jerry King 
reiterated the company's claim that it has been unable to find enough qualified 
workers locally. King called the relocations "neither an example of poor 
management nor fiscal extravagance."

SOUVENIRS REPORTED MISSING; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATIONS: COLLECTORS COMPLAIN THAT VALUABLE MEMORABILIA HAVE NOT BEEN 
RETURNED AFTER A PASADENA SHOW IN WHICH SPORTS CELEBRITIES SAID THEY WERE 
BILKED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
While Pasadena police explored allegations that sports celebrities and small 
businessmen had been bilked by a recent sports memorabilia show, new complaints 
surfaced from collectors who said valuable baseball memorabilia had not been 
returned to them. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena police officials said Tuesday that they still had not been able to 
find Ernest Dent, the principal promoter of the "Baseball Legends" card and 
collectibles show staged at the Pasadena Center Sept. 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
After the show -- believed to be the largest of the increasingly popular 
memorabilia events ever staged in Southern California -- several sports stars, 
including Mickey Mantle, Don Drysdale and Ernie Banks, claimed that checks they 
had been given for appearing at the show had bounced. Additionally, a number of 
business owners said they had not been paid for printing, travel, security and 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Pasadena Police Detective Mark Hansen said, he had been 
receiving calls from collectors and hobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
"They had sent memorabilia items to Baseball Legends in Glendale along with a 
check to have the stuff autographed and returned," Hansen said. "None of it has 
been returned." 
</P>
<P>
He said those calls have been referred to the Glendale Police Department and 
that these complaints may eventually be forwarded to postal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Mario Yagoda, Glendale police spokesman, said his department had 
received more than a dozen calls from businessmen and hobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sending out fraud complaint evaluation forms to people calling us who 
feel they have been victimized," he said. "When they return them we will 
determine if the supposed crime is a civil or criminal violation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Amormino, a public affairs officer with the Los Angeles Police Department, 
said he was missing a Mickey Mantle uniform with an estimated value of $1,500. 
Before the show, he had taken it to Dent's office in Glendale and paid $65 to 
have the uniform signed by Mickey Mantle during his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Dent) said 'we'll take care of it,' " Amormino recalled, but when he went 
to pick up the uniform two days after the show no one was at the office. 
</P>
<P>
George Harris, an Agoura physician, claimed he had sent Baseball Legends a 
baseball, with an estimated value of $500, that had been signed by all of the 
1966 Dodgers except Drysdale. He paid $18 to have Drysdale sign the ball when 
he attended the show. 
</P>
<P>
He has not gotten the ball back, although his check was cashed, Harris said. 
"I've had it since I was a kid," he added. "I've lost part of my childhood." 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Pasadena police, Yagoda said, Glendale officers had impounded 
a vehicle owned by Dent, parked at the Windsor Road townhouse where he lived, 
but it has not been seen for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Several people who had had business contacts with Dent at Baseball Legends said 
he set up his Glendale office in the spring and primarily worked with two men, 
one named Rick Abbott and another whom some knew as Dee Whitten and others as 
Dee Lipscomb. Hansen said he was also seeking to speak to these men. Abbott and 
Dent told people they came from West Virginia.

SURGICAL TOOL CITED IN FATAL FIRE AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 26-year-old patient who died in a UCLA operating room in May was the second 
Los Angeles victim in less than two years to perish in a flash fire caused by a 
spark-producing surgical tool, the Los Angeles Fire Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department, the UCLA Medical Center and three other agencies released 
results of a four-month investigation into the death of Angela Hernandez, who 
was being treated for massive heart and liver damage she had suffered in a 
traffic accident when material draped over her body caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by arson investigation officials during a news 
conference that included statements from hospital officials, representatives 
from the company that manufactures the cauterizing instrument that sparked the 
blaze, county health services officials and representatives of the state fire 
marshal's office. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies concurred in the Fire Department's finding that the blaze was 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1988, a cauterizing device sparked a fire that caused the death of 
a 15-day-old infant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Surgeons using the 
instrument accidentally ignited gauze that covered the infant as he underwent 
heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The pen-sized tool, common in operating rooms since the 1920s, uses an electric 
current to emit a constant stream of sparks that sear shut blood vessels and 
lessen bleeding during surgery. In an oxygen-rich operating room, the sparks 
can easily ignite cloth materials, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
In the UCLA fire, the cauterizing tool was not in use when the fire began, said 
Fire Department Battalion Chief William Burmester, who oversaw an investigation 
into the fire's cause. The cauterizing instrument, which was connected to a 
power source through a cord, dangled from the instrument tray as nurses and 
doctors maneuvered around the operating table. 
</P>
<P>
According to surgery room procedure, once an instrument falls out of the 
physicians' field of vision, it is considered contaminated and is disregarded. 
After the cauterizing tool was dislodged from its holster and rendered 
contaminated, one member of the operating staff "probably brushed or depressed 
the tool against the leg of the (instrument) tray," triggering sparks, 
Burmester said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department and hospital officials declined to identify the individuals 
responsible for dislodging or triggering the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"We found no negligence," Burmester said. "The instrument was not in a wrong or 
illegal place. . . . It was just there." 
</P>
<P>
The department issued a list of recommendations for establishing state safety 
requirements for operating rooms where "high-energy" surgical equipment is 
used. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA officials also said that Hernandez suffered from "what were probably three 
fatal injuries," and that her chances of survival before the fire were 
uncertain.

BUTTE COUNTY OKS BAILOUT OFFER TO AVOID BANKRUPTCY

Butte County supervisors, narrowly averting the nation's first county 
bankruptcy, on Tuesday approved the $11.1-million bailout offered by Gov. 
George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member board voted 3 to 2 to accept the Republican governor's 
proposal, which local officials said will avert immediate bankruptcy but will 
leave next year in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"We're only putting off the inevitable," said Supervisor Hack McInturf. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Deukmejian proposed deferring more than $6.3 million owed 
the state for fire protection services, postponed the state's demand for 
payment of a $2-million matching share for a new Butte County jail and offered 
a $1.15-million direct cash grant. The payment deferrals will allow the county 
to use those funds for local programs and services. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also calls for the county to raise about $1.65 million by 
increasing local fees, including property taxes and jail booking fees. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, the county agreed to scale back on requests for new 
law enforcement services, pay increases and other programs. The county said 
earlier that it needed $14.1 million to keep from going bankrupt, a figure that 
included expanded jail facilities and more deputies. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday county officials said they could survive with the $11.1 million 
to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis arose after county officials were unable to balance this year's 
$155-million budget, saying that 85% of their money was locked into existing 
programs by statute -- such as welfare and health care for the poor, and fire 
protection services.

ENROLLMENT HOLDS STEADY IN WAKE OF MILLS DECISION TO REMAIN ALL-WOMEN

In the aftermath of its highly publicized debate over coeducation and the 
decision to temporarily remain a women's college, Mills College reported 
Tuesday that its numbers of returning students and new "freshwomen" are down 
from last fall, but that enrollment of transfer students is up. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Mills has 774 undergraduates, three fewer students than in 
September, 1989, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Mills trustees voted to admit undergraduate men in 1991, and then 
reversed that decision after student and alumni protests. The college may admit 
men if it does not increase its enrollment to 900 by 1993, toward a target of 
1,000 by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Mills officials are concerned about the dips in first-year students from 162 to 
158 and in returning students from 544 to 520. They are encouraged by the 
nearly offsetting rise in transfers and emphasize that effects of a new 
recruiting program would not be felt until next year. Since the coeducation 
furor, the school also has had to cope with the resignations of its president, 
admissions director and dean of faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Mills is one of three women's colleges in the West, along with Scripps in 
Claremont and Mount St. Mary's in Los Angeles.

WILSON FUND-RAISER HEADLINED BY BUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Invoking the name of Pete Wilson's policeman grandfather, killed in a gunfight 
with Chicago drug runners 82 years ago, President Bush on Tuesday praised the 
senator as a candidate who shares Bush's "sense of mission" in continuing the 
often-bleak war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in Los Angeles for the first of two fund-raisers expected to add some $2 
million to Wilson's campaign bank account, spent much of his Tuesday night 
address defending his anti-Iraq strategy. 
</P>
<P>
But in a boost to Wilson he also emphasized drugs -- a theme the Republican 
gubernatorial candidate has depended upon in his march to election day -- and 
praised Wilson's support of federal anti-crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"So when your senator says we need to protect the public and the police from 
cop killers and kingpins, when he says that those who deal in death should reap 
what they sow, you can be sure, Pete Wilson means business," Bush told hundreds 
of Republican donors, who paid $1,000 a plate to attend the gathering at the 
Westin Bonaventure Hotel downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told the guests the story of Michael Callahan, Wilson's grandfather, who 
was slain at 30, when Wilson's mother was just a toddler. Wilson himself 
frequently uses the story in speeches to law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also borrowed Wilson's self-descriptions in calling the senator both a 
"conservative" and a would-be "activist" governor. 
</P>
<P>
In introducing Bush, Wilson drew an indirect comparison between the President's 
1988 promises and Wilson's similar pledges this year to increase preschool 
education, oppose offshore oil drilling and talk tough about drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
As guests lingered over tables decorated with small American flags, Wilson 
tried out a joke that compared the actions of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to 
the antics of actor Warren Beatty in the Hollywood bomb, "Ishtar." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, however, issued Hussein a new given name, "'Haddam." 
</P>
<P>
Three protesters were arrested after they allegedly intervened when police 
tried to arrest a demonstrator outside the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 demonstrators were spray painting limousines and hotel walls while 
shouting "anti-American slogans," said Police Sgt. Frank Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
As police were they arresting one man, Hancock said, two men and a woman 
scuffled with the officers, allowing the suspect to escape. 
</P>
<P>
The three demonstrators, who were not identified, were placed under arrest. The 
Republican Party and the President have invested substantial time in California 
this political season. The state is due to add seven congressional seats to its 
delegation in the next reapportionment, and the governor will have the 
authority to approve or veto any redistricting plan. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is expected to raise another $1 million for Wilson in San Francisco today. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's Democratic opponent, Dianne Feinstein, Tuesday received the 
endorsement of the 200,000-member Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a choice between someone who is good and someone who is significantly 
better on the environment," the club's political director, Claudia Elliott, 
said during an endorsement ceremony in Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the former San Francisco mayor spoke to several hundred members of a Los 
Angeles business group, the Headquarters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
She promised that if she wins she will convene a bipartisan summit meeting the 
day after the election to begin reforming the state budget process. 
</P>
<P>
Sounding somewhat like Gov. George Deukmejian, Feinstein complained that ballot 
initiatives and court decisions have severely limited the governor's 
flexibility in setting fiscal priorities.

IRAQ BEEFS UP ITS TROOP STRENGTH ON SAUDI BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Iraq has continued to build up its troop concentrations along the Saudi border, 
increasing its forces to 360,000 over the last two weeks while moving large 
numbers of tanks and artillery back from the front lines, the Pentagon said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The force compares to defense intelligence estimates of 265,000 men in roughly 
the same area two weeks ago. During the same period, the number of tanks has 
increased from 2,200 to 2,800. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams characterized the buildup as gradual, rather 
than a "sudden surge." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the Iraqi troops remain in defensive formations but are capable 
of quickly moving to the offensive. He said Iraqi commanders have shifted 
tanks, armored vehicles and artillery back from the Saudi border and moved 
infantry units forward, although he declined to speculate about what the 
changes mean. 
</P>
<P>
But a senior American military officer, interviewed separately, said the new 
deployment clearly indicates that the Iraqis are preparing for an assault by 
U.S.-led forces and are putting their armor in the rear to be in position to 
launch a counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq firmly believes we're going to attack," the officer said. He said that 
the disposition of the Iraqi troops indicates they may be prepared to "stay and 
fight and die in place. . . . We're just not sure about the willpower of the 
Iraqi army. But they must know they can't win." 
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, in another sudden high-level move in the gulf crisis, Syrian 
President Hafez Assad disclosed Tuesday that he will go to Tehran next week for 
talks with Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani. 
</P>
<P>
The visit, Assad's first to Iran, comes on the heels of Tehran's decision to 
normalize relations with Iraq. The announcement, made simultaneously in Amman 
and Tehran, said the invitation came from Rafsanjani but gave no further 
details. 
</P>
<P>
"This comes as a complete surprise," a Western diplomat here said. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's developing relations with Syria are certain to be a key topic, diplomats 
here said. Another topic could be the issue of Western hostages in Lebanon. 
Both Syria and Iran have been instrumental in the release of five hostages this 
year, including two Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the Pentagon said the U.S. Navy had boarded a Soviet vessel in 
the Red Sea on Monday but had allowed it to proceed after determining that it 
was not carrying prohibited cargo. 
</P>
<P>
A team of Navy and Coast Guard officers from the guided missile cruiser Biddle 
boarded the Soviet ship, the Pyotr Masherov, after the Soviet skipper granted 
permission. The inspection was part of the multinational naval effort to 
enforce the United Nations trade embargo against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet ship proceeded to the Jordanian port of Aqaba, Williams said. He 
said there was no protest from the Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
The boarding of the Pyotr Masherov was the first time that a Soviet ship has 
been inspected in the month that the United States and other nations have been 
interdicting shipping headed for Iraq. Ships from Italy and Turkey also were 
boarded and allowed to proceed without incident Monday, defense officials said. 
</P>
<P>
To date there have been 1,030 intercepts of ship traffic in the waters 
surrounding the Arabian Peninsula, Williams said. Such actions range from 
routine radio interrogation to forced boardings. Seventy ships have been 
boarded, and five of them were diverted from intended ports because they were 
carrying banned cargo to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of Assad's visit to Tehran was made as an Iranian delegation 
left Baghdad after three days of talks on restoring diplomatic ties, the first 
high-level meeting between the two gulf powers in a decade.

Syria supported Iran in its 1980-88 war with Iraq, and Syria and Iran have both 
condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Assad said last Thursday, a day before his talks with Secretary of States James 
A. Baker III, that the invasion and the resulting crisis were "painful for 
every Arab citizen." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem now," he said, "is not the presence of foreign troops in the gulf. 
The problem is Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. This invasion allowed foreign troops 
to come to Saudi Arabia and the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
He said it was "a disgrace to see one Arab country invade another" and that it 
"is not the Arab way in Arab history for the big to eat the small." 
</P>
<P>
The problem of Kuwait "should be solved between the Arabs," he said, and added: 
</P>
<P>
"When it is over, I am sure that all foreign troops will withdraw. But first, 
all Arab countries should stand together against the invasion of one Arab 
brother by another. It offers to the enemies of the Arab nation a great 
historic gain." 
</P>
<P>
Assad said that Syria will send more troops to Saudi Arabia to join the 3,500 
Syrians already deployed there. No timetable or numbers have been made public 
but, according to diplomats in Damascus, an armored division may be sent, along 
with other forces, or 15,000 to 20,000 additional troops. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the invitation to Assad, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency 
said, "Observers attach special significance to President Assad's visit 
(because of) the crisis in the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Iran's three-man delegation to Iraq, led by Deputy Foreign Minister Manuchehr 
Mottaki, left Baghdad amid signs of a possible hitch in negotiations. Although 
Mottaki called the discussions "positive, fruitful and friendly," the exchange 
of prisoners from the 1980-88 war -- an emotional issue for Iran -- apparently 
hit a snag. Iraq announced Sunday that the exchange of prisoners had been 
halted. No reason was given, and there has been no confirmation from Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
A week after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, President Saddam Hussein, 
pressed by mounting international opposition, proposed to end a hostile 
two-year truce with Iran by accepting peace on Tehran's terms. Rafsanjani 
quickly agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops were withdrawn from territory seized from Iran, and Iraq agreed to 
a 50-50 division of the Shatt al Arab, the waterway that forms the southern 
border between the two countries. An estimated 100,000 prisoners on both sides 
began returning home. 
</P>
<P>
International Red Cross officials said about 25,000 still remained to be 
exchanged last weekend when Iraq announced that the program had been 
interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement to restore diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors for the 
first time since Iraqi forces invaded Iran in September, 1980, was the 
culmination of Baghdad's diplomatic campaign to neutralize Iran in the gulf 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In a visit to Tehran last week, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz made the 
offer and Mottaki flew to Baghdad on Sunday to begin negotiations. He 
reportedly was instructed to arrange a visit by the Iranian foreign minister, 
Ali Akbar Velayati. 
</P>
<P>
The improvement of relations between Iran and Iraq has led to concern in the 
United States and other countries that Iran might rescind its support of the 
U.N. embargo on trade with Iraq. The early hard line that Iran took in the gulf 
crisis has shown signs of softening. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Iraqi newspaper reported Tuesday that Saadoun Shaker, a friend of 
Saddam Hussein and a member of the Iraqi Revolution Command Council, had 
resigned because of failing health. 
</P>
<P>
The government newspaper, Al Waqai al Iraqiya, gave no further details, 
although some Western diplomats said they believe Shaker had been forced out 
for opposing Hussein's Kuwait policy. 
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official was quoted as saying there were 
divisions on policy matters concerning Kuwait among other key Hussein aides, 
among them Foreign Minister Aziz. 
</P>
<P>
Cairo Radio reported that Iraqi troops supported by tanks had taken up strong 
new positions near a number of diplomatic compounds in Kuwait, including the 
U.S. Embassy. It offered no suggestion as to what the Iraqis' intent might be. 
</P>

KEATING INDICTED FOR FRAUD, JAILED; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L PROBE: THREE ASSOCIATES AT LINCOLN SAVINGS AND AMERICAN CONTINENTAL 
ALSO ARE CHARGED. A GRAND JURY SAYS THEY VICTIMIZED INVESTORS IN THE SALE OF 
BONDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Charles H. Keating Jr., blamed by regulators for one of the nation's biggest 
savings and loan failures, was jailed Tuesday after being indicted on 42 counts 
of state securities fraud and other violations. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Keating's business associates were also charged under state grand jury 
indictments unsealed Tuesday. The criminal charges are the first to arise from 
investigations into the failure of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and 
its parent company, American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner set bail at $5 million for 
Keating, former chairman of American Continental. When Keating was unable to 
post the bond, he was led away in handcuffs to Los Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The other defendants -- Keating's top aide, Judy J. Wischer, and former Lincoln 
presidents Ray C. Fidel and Robin S. Symes -- are being held on bonds of $1 
million each. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, defiant in the face of regulatory scrutiny and willing to go out on 
the stump to seek support for his views, became a lightning rod for criticism 
about S&amp;L deregulation and events that led to the thrift-industry disaster, 
which regulators now estimate will cost U.S. taxpayers more than $500 billion 
over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
His indictment adds to the small but growing list of thrift executives 
nationwide who have been accused or convicted of fraud. Federal authorities 
estimate that fraud caused or contributed to the downfall of at least 40% of 
the nation's failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, justice is finally beginning to catch up with Keating," said Jake 
Lewis, a spokesman for Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), whose House Banking 
Committee hearings last year on the failure of Lincoln exposed as much 
bureaucratic bungling as alleged wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments accuse the defendants of victimizing investors who bought 
American Continental bonds through Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches in 
1987 and 1988. Although more than 15,000 investors bought the bonds, the 
indictments focus on 20 victims who lost between $50,000 and $100,000 each, 
said Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
"These victims are people who have lost their life savings and are probably 
never going to see that money again," said Reiner, who served as a special 
state prosecutor in the case at the request of state Atty. Gen. John K. Van De 
Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants are accused of making false and misleading statements or wrongly 
omitting information to the public about the bonds. They also are charged with 
exceeding the authority given them to sell the securities, lying to the 
Department of Corporations to obtain approval for the bond sales, and failing 
to file a copy of the advertisement about the offering with the state agency. 
</P>
<P>
The charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments are "tightly focused," Reiner said, so that prosecutors can 
bring to trial a case the jurors can easily comprehend. He said too many fraud 
cases are lost at trial because they are too confusing. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Keating nor his attorney, Stephen C. Neal of Chicago, responded to the 
charges Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Keating has denied that he misled anyone or defrauded American 
Continental securities holders. He has said that a public prospectus 
accompanying the bond offering detailed the company's financial condition and 
stated clearly on the first page that the securities were not insured. 
</P>
<P>
State regulators said that while monitoring the sales undercover in 1987 they 
did not find anything wrong with the way the securities were sold. 
</P>
<P>
Keating also has denied that he purposely sold a batch of securities through 
Lincoln because they were so risky that no brokerage would sell them. He has 
said that he would have recommended those securities to Mother Teresa, the 
Nobel Peace Prize-winning missionary from India whose work he supported 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments stem from one of several investigations focusing on the April, 
1989, failure of Lincoln, a high-flying thrift that invested heavily in 
high-yield junk bonds and risky real estate projects. Its collapse is expected 
to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Los Angeles is conducting a wide-ranging probe into the 
collapse of Lincoln. Thrift regulators are seeking $1.1 billion from Keating 
and others in a civil racketeering lawsuit. Numerous suits have also been filed 
against Keating and others by bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
William D. Davis, commissioner of the state Department of Savings and Loan, 
praised the grand jury and the district attorney's office for their quick 
action. The grand jury had been investigating the case since mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
Many small investors, mostly elderly Southern Californians, claim they were 
misled into moving their money from insured deposits to the high-risk, 
uninsured bonds in a "classic bait and switch" tactic used by Lincoln tellers 
and American Continental salespeople. The investors bought nearly $200 million 
in bonds, which are now nearly worthless. 
</P>
<P>
"The nature of these investments were misrepresented," Reiner said. "When 
people came in with their life savings, they thought they were dealing with 
people who had their best interests at heart." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said details supporting the charges in the indictments would be released 
within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Klausner stunned Keating, the other defendants and their attorneys when he set 
the high bail. Defense attorneys had asked that their clients be released 
without having to post bail. Reiner's office did not oppose the request but 
reserved the right to argue later that bond be set. 
</P>
<P>
Klausner said he set the high bail on his own initiative because the charges 
expose the defendants to up to 10 years in prison and because the amount of 
money involved was "substantial." Prosecutors typically seek high bail only 
when they suspect defendants might flee. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, who had been leaning against a courtroom partition with his right hand 
in his pocket during much of the hearing, stood up straight but otherwise 
showed no emotion when the judge set bail. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked," said Donald Smaltz, attorney for Symes, who was visibly shaken 
by the judge's decision. "It was a heavy-duty emotional hit for him. Nobody 
expected to be remanded to custody." 
</P>
<P>
David W. Wiechert, attorney for Fidel, said the defense lawyers are joining in 
a motion to ask Klausner to reduce bail. He said he hopes the papers will be 
filed by tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
The four defendants, who had been fingerprinted, photographed and booked before 
their 9:30 a.m. arraignment by the prosecutor's office, were taken immediately 
to jail. They did not enter pleas, postponing that until Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Their clients will remain in jail unless they can post bond. Keating, once with 
a net worth of $39 million, claims he is now a pauper. The other defendants 
also cannot afford the bail, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and his colleagues could be released if they post a cash bond for the 
entire amount, which is unlikely. More likely, they could provide a bail 
bondsman with collateral of up to 150% of the bond amount plus a fee of 10% in 
cash. For Keating, that fee would be $500,000, an amount he contends he does 
not have. 
</P>
<P>
While the high bail surprised and shocked the defendants and their attorneys, 
the action was cheered by others. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that all the (bond) holders are cheering, but that's no consolation, 
we're still out of our money," said Steve Roth of San Fernando Valley, who had 
invested $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This will make people stop and think how rough it is on judgment day and will 
revive in the public eye what an awful thing happened here," said Ronald Rus of 
Orange, an attorney for investors who lost more than $250 million in the 
collapse of Lincoln and American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a guy who managed to buy influence like nobody we've ever seen, but he 
can't buy himself out of a cell," Rus said, referring to the large amount of 
campaign funds and other donations that Keating generated for politicians such 
as Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif). 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and three others declined to comment on the indictments. Sen. John 
McCain (R-Ariz.), one of the five U.S. senators whose careers have been damaged 
by their links to Keating's political funding, said he is "confident the 
judicial system will fully and fairly function and reach proper resolution on 
this issue." 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Keating Five -- which also includes Donald W. Riegle Jr. 
(D-Mich.), Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio) -- received more 
than $1.3 million in campaign funds and other donations from Keating 
fund-raising efforts. They also intervened on his behalf to question regulators 
in 1987 about the lengthy audit that regulators were conducting. 
</P>
<P>
Keating had reason to be concerned about regulatory wrath. Federal agents in 
San Francisco wanted to seize the institution in 1987, but were rebuffed by 
their superiors in Washington.

THEY MISCALCULATED, LOTTERY OFFICIALS SAY;

Admitting they miscalculated player reaction when they increased the odds in 
Lotto, state lottery officials are preparing to order changes in the game that 
would make it easier to win $1-million prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery Commission Chairman Dennis Malody said player dissatisfaction with a 
decision implemented in June that nearly doubled the odds of winning super 
jackpots has led lottery commissioners to "revisit" the issue. 
</P>
<P>
He said the five commissioners have given their staff a month to come up with 
recommendations for changing the game in a way that would "restore player 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners have asked the staff to look into an array of options, he said, 
including the introduction of a new game that would have smaller jackpots and 
better odds, modifications in the current game to improve the odds or a return 
to the game that was played before the June changes. 
</P>
<P>
"My interpretation of the response is not necessarily that (the new game) is 
the problem. The odds issue is the problem," Malody said. "The answer is to 
make the odds more attractive to the players and how that is accomplished I 
have to leave to the people who are more involved in game design than I am." 
</P>
<P>
To rekindle player interest in Lotto, the most popular of the state lottery 
games, officials made alterations in the game that were designed to generate 
more super jackpots. Instead of choosing six numbers from a field of 49, on 
June 21 players began choosing six from a field of 53. The expansion of the 
field changed the odds of winning from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 23 million. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Malody said, individual commissioners as well as the lottery have 
received a flood of complaints from players who objected to the higher odds. To 
add to their troubles, he said, the game changes have not yet produced a huge 
jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
By expanding the field of numbers, officials had hoped to have more drawings 
where there were no winners so that one day's pot would be added to the next 
one. While there have been several jackpots exceeding $30 million, there have 
not been a succession of rollovers to produce the kind of jackpots -- like the 
recent $100-million lottery jackpot in Florida -- that draw national publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a product on the street which is designed to be a large jackpot game 
under theory that there is a portion of the population who want to play for 
that jackpot," said Malody. "There is also a group of people who play and do 
not want large jackpots. They would rather have 20 $1-million jackpots than one 
$20-million jackpot." 
</P>
<P>
Among the changes suggested by the lottery commissioners, was the introduction 
of a game that would have players choosing six numbers from a field of 40. 
</P>
<P>
But more likely to be recommended by the staff are changes in the current Lotto 
game that would still allow super jackpots to accumulate and at the same time 
give players a chance at winning a smaller jackpot with better odds. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne McNabb, the lottery's communications manager, said officials are 
conducting a trial this week with a new twist on the game that makes all 
players holding three of the six numbers drawn participants in a second 
drawing. That drawing, to be held automatically by computer right after the 
main drawing, will pick 10 winners who each would be awarded a $1-million 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
So far ticket sales have been brisk, she said. While the odds of winning a 
$1-million prize depend on the number of tickets sold, officials estimated they 
will be about 1 in 1.7 million. The odds of getting into the second pool are 1 
in 71. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said the lottery staff has been aware for some time that there is a gap 
in the variety of lottery games offered and has been working on a new game to 
close it. She said studies show that a large number would like a separate game 
offering lower odds with a jackpot of around $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
She said commissioners have asked the staff to study the possibility of 
hastening the introduction of the new game, now under development. It has been 
scheduled for introduction next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be responsive to our playership and we don't want them to feel . . 
. that we don't care," said Malody.

BODIES OF 3 MISSING TEENS FOUND IN REMOTE REGION 
</P>

<P>
The bodies of three teen-age San Jacinto boys, missing since Sept. 9, have been 
found in a remote desert area of Riverside County, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and relatives said the youths disappeared when one was giving the other 
two a ride home in his pickup truck. The boys, all neighborhood friends, lived 
less than a mile apart. 
</P>
<P>
Two bodies were found Sunday in the Hixon Flat area of the San Bernardino 
National Forest, about 15 miles southeast of Hemet, said Riverside County 
sheriff's spokeswoman Pat Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
The third body was found Tuesday, as teams of rescuers from the Sheriff's 
Department, the San Jacinto Police Department and other agencies combed the 
rugged terrain. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the county coroner's office said the three bodies were in 
advanced state of decomposition. Although tentatively identified, the names of 
the youths were being withheld pending autopsies and checks of dental records. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrice Strother of San Jacinto said authorities told her one of the bodies 
was that of her son, William, 17. Strother said her son disappeared while 
getting a ride home from one of the missing youths. 
</P>
<P>
Strother said she last saw her son the night of Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he'd be back by 10; that was the last time I saw him," she said. "He 
doesn't do that. I figure he was with his sister. When he wasn't, I put the 
police report in." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Forest Service rangers found the body of one of the boys and a truck 
registered to him Sunday morning on a dirt road in Hixon Flat. Helicopters and 
search teams were dispatched to the area and a second body was found about 2 
p.m. three miles west of the truck, just east of Cactus Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Daylight searches resumed Monday and Tuesday. Rescuers found the third body 
Tuesday, about 1 1/2 miles east of the truck, according to relatives of one of 
the apparent victims. 
</P>
<P>
"Our theory is that somebody was chasing them for them to split up like that," 
said Shirley Durston, a friend of the Strother family. "Willie was taught by 
his sister how to mountain-climb and how to survive out in the wilderness. He 
knows all the little tricks. That's why we can't picture him at the bottom of a 
ravine." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said the case was tentatively being treated as a homicide, 
routine until autopsies are completed.

UTILITY TAKES ISSUE WITH COUNTY OVER EMISSIONS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON SAYS IF MORE STUDIES ARE NOT CONDUCTED 
AT ITS TWO POWER PLANTS IN OXNARD, IT MIGHT SUE BEFORE IT MAKES ANY REDUCTION 
IN NITROGEN OXIDE POLLUTANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Edison is challenging Ventura County's legal right to 
require a drastic reduction in Edison's pollution-causing emissions without 
first performing more studies. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the results of such studies, Edison might also challenge the 
county's plan to require the utility to reduce by 90% the emissions from its 
two power plants in Oxnard, a company official said. 
</P>
<P>
And if the studies aren't done, the company may sue before it makes any 
reductions, the company's attorneys hint. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for more studies, which came in a letter last week to Richard 
Baldwin, county air pollution control officer, might be a tactic to delay or 
weaken the proposed 90% reduction, which is called Rule 59, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
The regulation has been targeted for adoption in May, 1991, by county 
supervisors, but the study Edison wants could delay adoption by months, Baldwin 
said. If the issue resulted in a court battle -- hinted at by Edison in its 
letter -- resolution might take years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the district wishes to avoid possible litigation," Edison attorneys said in 
the correspondence, the district must conduct a computer modeling study. 
</P>
<P>
A computer model would study the effects of the 4,250 tons of nitrogen oxides 
emitted each year by Edison's two county power plants. 
</P>
<P>
Previous computer modeling studies in the county have looked at regionwide 
effects of all the pollutants emitted into the air, but Edison officials say 
those studies are not adequate in determining whether or how much Edison's 
emissions should be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said Edison's request for computer modeling is unreasonable, since the 
Environmental Protection Agency has already performed overall computer model 
studies in the county. Because ozone air pollution is a regionwide problem and 
not a single-site phenomenon, a modeling study on the effects at a single 
location is not necessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be a way to delay the process," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Baggerly, a board member of the Environmental Coalition, said Edison's 
challenge citing legal opinion is a blatant attempt to intimidate the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Edison talks about its good-corporate-neighbor policy, and all the while they 
are figuring out more ways to pollute the air," Baggerly said. "Edison has 
demonstrated consistent opposition to the rule that would force them to clean 
up their power plants." 
</P>
<P>
But Edison said the power company merely wants the information to determine the 
best way to reduce ozone air pollution in Ventura County and help the county 
reach federal health standards for the pollutant. 
</P>
<P>
"We are merely pointing out what we believe are necessary analyses to be 
performed in the environmental impact report," said Nadar N. Mansour, Edison's 
manager of environmental regulations. "We are not contesting the 90% rule; we 
are simply saying that before the air pollution agency can proceed with a rule 
of this nature, there are analyses they must do." 
</P>
<P>
He protested the suggestion that his company was practicing delay tactics. 
"Nothing could be farther from the truth," he said. It is too early to even 
talk about court action if the district were to ignore Edison's advice, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County fails both federal and state health standards for ozone 
pollution. Ozone pollution is formed when nitrogen oxides emitted by the power 
plants and other smaller sources react in the presence of sunlight with 
hydrocarbons predominantly emitted by car tailpipes. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated Sept. 11, Mansour told Baldwin and the Ventura County Air 
Pollution Control District that, in the opinion of Edison's legal department, 
the proposed regulation could not be adopted until the district performs 
specific computer modeling. The legal opinion attached to Mansour's letter 
cites the California Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
Mansour said Edison officials have not seen any studies proving that reducing 
nitrogen oxide emissions have reduced ozone pollution in Ventura County. He 
said the modeling, which would look specifically at the effects of the 
emissions of the Edison plants and not consider emissions from the rest of the 
county, is needed to determine whether Rule 59 is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The second question, Mansour said, is whether the rule, if necessary, should be 
as stringent as 90%. Edison knows of measures that would reduce emissions by as 
much as 60% at substantially less cost than the estimated $12,000 per ton it 
would cost to install the technology needed to reach 90% reductions. 
</P>
<P>
But Baldwin said the $1 per month that may be added to consumers' bills as a 
result will be worth the cost. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that pollution cannot be cleaned up free of charge," Baldwin said. 
"There is a price to pay, just like when you buy a car or paint or any product 
that had to use pollution control equipment to manufacture the product."

GROUPS BACK 2 LATINOS FOR OXNARD SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Latino candidates for the Oxnard elementary school board, which a Latino 
teachers group has criticized for its lack of Latino representation, have 
received endorsements from a teachers union and the Oxnard chapter of the Assn. 
of Mexican-American Educators. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Barreto, a former teacher and counselor with El Concilio, a Latino rights 
advocacy group in Oxnard, and Manuel R. Razo, a youth worker with the state, 
are two of the seven candidates seeking seats on the Oxnard Elementary School 
District board in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsement is the first by the union, the Oxnard Educators Assn., since 
1974, President Ann Hendricks said. 
</P>
<P>
The 505-member union also endorsed incumbent William D. Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsements of the two Latino candidates comes after a year when board 
member Jack T. Fowler, who is seeking reelection in November, was criticized by 
the Mexican-American teachers group for being insensitive to Latino issues. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler was endorsed by the union in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Three seats are open on the board, which represents a district that is 72% 
Latino. Only one Latino has been elected to the board before, nearly 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Former Latino board member James Gallardo was appointed. 
</P>
<P>
The union "has discussed in the past how our board doesn't represent the 
community as far as nationalities and race" are concerned, Hendricks said. "We 
would have to have several Hispanics on the board to show what our population 
is. Our entire board is Anglo." 
</P>
<P>
But Hendricks and members of the Mexican-American teachers group said Tuesday 
that race was not the issue when the endorsements were made. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very qualified candidates," said Sandra Echavarria, president of the 
Mexican-American teachers group. She said Razo and Barreto were the only 
candidates who approached the 96-member group to seek endorsements. "They just 
happen to be Latino." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Alvarez, union vice president, said the fact that both candidates are 
Latino "is not intentional, but we do recognize a need there." 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the union and the Mexican-American educators group said they 
will give financial help to Razo and Barreto. 
</P>
<P>
Members from both groups will campaign on the candidates' behalf, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Dorothie J. Sterling said she is uncertain whether the endorsement 
will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope the election would hinge more on who the voters feel has the 
experience, the knowledge, the background and the desire to do the job, rather 
than whether you're black, white, purple or brown," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling, Hill and another candidate, Jim Suter, are retired teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hansen, an Oxnard engineer, is also seeking election.

$2-MILLION TRAINING OF FIELD HANDS CRITICIZED; 
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYMENT: AN OBSCURE STATE PANEL APPROVED A CONTRACT WITH SIX VENTURA COUNTY 
GROWERS TO GIVE WORKERS ON-THE-JOB INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO PICK OTHER KINDS OF 
CROPS. 
</P>

<P>
How do you teach a seasonal farm worker whose specialty is harvesting lettuce 
to become proficient at picking beets? Or weeding carrots and radishes? Or 
thinning broccoli? 
</P>
<P>
According to an obscure state agency called the Employment Training Panel, you 
direct the worker to watch an instructional video and listen to a lecture for 
an hour. Then you send him or her out to the vegetable field for 59 hours of 
on-the-job training for each crop. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, you provide the employers of this and other field hands nearly $2 
million in state funds to pay for this "cross-training" so seasonal workers 
will become expert in tending other crops year-round. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by the Employment Training Panel last month in a contract 
with the Ventura County Agricultural Assn., which represents six major growers 
and a huge egg factory. 
</P>
<P>
Award of the $2-million contract, which would cover about 800 trainee workers, 
was vigorously protested by a representative of the Deukmejian Administration 
as an abuse that could be attacked as "farmer welfare." 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty-nine hours to learn how to pick a tomato . . . is somewhat ridiculous," 
said Juan Chacon, the state Employment Development Department's advocate for 
migrant seasonal farm workers. He told the panel he was sent to the meeting as 
a representative of Alice Gonzalez, director of the department. 
</P>
<P>
"It is, in our opinion, a subsidy to agricultural employers and those employers 
generally are already subsidized at length by other government programs," 
Chacon said. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon said that even without a state grant, employers would see to it that 
field hands learn to pick the crops as part of their normal work. He also 
warned that even after farm workers completed the training, the issue would 
remain "as to why we are paying training money to train people to earn just 
barely above minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
The virtually autonomous panel -- three members are appointed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian and four by the Legislature -- approved the contract on a 5-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Scarcely two weeks later, Deukmejian quietly eased out his appointees -- who 
had all voted for the contract -- and named three new members. Press Secretary 
Robert Gore insisted that the approval of the contract and appointment of new 
panelists were unrelated actions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no linkage, no retribution," Gore said. "We just wanted to give more 
Californians a chance to serve." 
</P>
<P>
The contract has not been formally signed and may be reviewed by the three new 
Deukmejian appointees. 
</P>
<P>
The Employment Training Panel was created in 1983 to help finance training and 
retraining of workers as new technologies threatened them with unemployment. As 
part of their unemployment insurance contributions, California employers are 
taxed to finance the program. 
</P>
<P>
Although it paddles quietly in the backwaters of state bureaucracy, the tiny 
agency dispenses mega-grants. Over the last six years, it has given $565 
million in contracts. This year, it is expected to spend $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
Recipients have included such major employers as Pacific Bell, Bank of America, 
Carter Hawley Hale, Ralphs, Nordstrom, Vons and leading electronics and defense 
industry companies. Job training programs of the United Auto Workers and other 
labor unions also are leading recipients. 
</P>
<P>
A key provision of the Employment Training Panel law requires that grants 
should make a "substantial contribution to the long-term job security" of the 
trainees -- who are paid their regular wages while in the program -- and 
"result in jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Chacon charged that the contract with Ventura growers offered nothing for 
low-paid agricultural laborers to get into the mainstream of the California 
economy. "They are and will remain on the fringe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The field hand proposal is not believable or credible," agreed panel member 
Elinor Glenn of Burbank, a retired officer of the Service Employees 
International Union. "I don't believe we ought to be in that business. . . . I 
think it is a wage subsidy." 
</P>
<P>
The contract was defended by a spokesman for the Ventura County Agricultural 
Assn., which will pass the program funds on to seven employers: Rio Farms, San 
Miguel Produce, Underwood Ranches, Do Right's Plant Growers, Deardorff-Jackson 
Co., Bob Jones Ranch and Egg City. 
</P>
<P>
Association spokesman Steve Meyers told the hearing that the growers wanted to 
train the migrant seasonal workers to perform multiple tasks on various crops 
so they could work throughout the year in the Ventura County area instead of 
leaving to follow crops around the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to get these people skilled enough, to increase their wage 
enough, and to provide continuous work through several different crops . . .," 
Meyers said. "It is a misnomer, I think, to say if you can pick one crop, you 
can pick another. You simply can't." 
</P>
<P>
Meyers said that the proper cultivation, picking, bunching, banding, boxing and 
lifting of different vegetables varies widely and demands a multitude of 
carefully honed skills. 
</P>
<P>
Besides field hands, others in the $2-million program would be trained in the 
operation of sophisticated farm machinery and handling techniques used in 
nurseries and packing sheds. 
</P>
<P>
As their share of the training, farmers would contribute $93,555 worth of 
in-kind support, typically for administrative costs and training supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Another panel member, James Quillan of Byron, executive director of the 
California Conference of Machinists, said he believes farm laborers are 
entitled to participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not prepared to just close the door on those folks at this point, because 
I think we're supposed to be trying to serve them," Quillan said of the Ventura 
farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
The present Ventura contract is almost identical to a two-year, $2.3-million 
plan approved in 1989 for one Ventura County grower, Boskovich Farms. In a 
review of that training performance, the panel's staff in August criticized the 
Boskovich program. 
</P>
<P>
It noted that of a group of 113 workers who completed the Boskovich training, 
recent payroll records show only 65 were still employed there 90 days later. 
</P>
<P>
The staff reported that George Boskovich, vice president of the farm, said some 
workers went elsewhere for better pay and some left for housing and family 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the panel said the three Deukmejian appointees had actively 
sought reappointment. "They were extremely distressed to find out they were not 
reappointed," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The appointees were Chairman Robert C. Thierry of Fairfield, a retired federal 
employee; Helen J. Martin of Newhall, owner of an automobile parts store, and 
Robert Munoz, an Oxnard insurance executive. 
</P>
<P>
Two appointees of the Legislature, Quillan and Pat Williams, a UAW official, 
also voted for the contract. The two other legislative appointees, Glenn and 
Steve Mack of Oakland, a Teamsters leader, voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
The new chairman, William Woods of Lafayette, a retired vice president of 
AT&amp;T, said last week that he was not familiar with the issue and was 
unprepared to say whether he would seek to have the contract reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

OXNARD COUNCIL MAJORITY FAVORS 5 VOTES TO RELEASE PRIVATE PAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three members of the Oxnard City Council said Tuesday they support a policy 
that requires the approval of all five council members to disclose confidential 
documents from the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, recommended by City Atty. Gary Gillig, was set for council action 
on Tuesday but was put off until Oct. 9 when Councilwoman Geraldine (Gerry) 
Furr returns from a three-week vacation. 
</P>
<P>
At a council meeting Tuesday, Mayor Nao Takasugi and council members Manuel 
Lopez and Dorothy Maron supported the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We must have a way so we can challenge the opinion of the city attorney" on 
which memos are declared confidential, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Councilwoman Ann Johs, who recommended that a decision be delayed to 
allow Furr to vote on the matter, said in an interview that she opposes the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Johs said it would make it too difficult to release confidential documents and 
suggested that the council adopt a policy requiring the consent of only three 
council members to disclose such documents. 
</P>
<P>
Johs raised the issue earlier this month when she criticized Gillig, saying he 
generates too many confidential reports and memos. She requested that the 
council adopt a formal policy to allow the council to release to the public 
private documents produced by Gillig's office. 
</P>
<P>
In a previous discussion on the matter, Johs said that 90% of the confidential 
memos and reports generated by Gillig should not have been confidential. 
</P>
<P>
During his presentation of the proposal, Gillig defended his policy. He said he 
declares many of his reports and memos confidential to protect the city from 
criticism and litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I am conservative," he said. "I am a conservative attorney." 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Gillig said his office has generated 148 confidential 
briefing reports to the council, of which 134 related directly to claims 
against the city, court cases, potential litigation and personnel issues. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 14 reports and memos concerned items of interest to the City 
Council and contained legal opinions and recommendations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillig said his confidential reports and memos are provided to the city 
manager, the assistant city manager and all five council members. 
</P>
<P>
The city has never had a formal policy on the matter, but Gillig said he has 
had an informal policy that requires the consent of at least four council 
members before a confidential document is released. If the council adopts the 
proposed policy, it would become more difficult to release such a document. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said Gillig recently drafted a confidential report on the legal issue 
involved in forming a seven-member council that Lopez believes should never 
have been considered confidential. The memo, which was later released, said the 
city would be required to form seven council districts if it decides to 
increase the number of council members to seven. 
</P>
<P>
The council also discussed what to do if one council member discloses a 
confidential document to the public without the consent of the other members. 
</P>
<P>
Gillig said the cities of Costa Mesa, Anaheim and Pasadena have adopted laws, 
making it a misdemeanor for a person to disclose a confidential document 
without the consent of the entire council. 
</P>
<P>
Maron said she would support a penalty for any council member who discloses a 
secret report but would oppose a law that puts offenders in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi said a disclosure policy would be useless unless there is a penalty 
for violators. He suggested expelling violators from the council. 
</P>
<P>
Gillig said there would also be considerable difficulty in proving such an 
offense. "It's a difficult problem to solve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council took no action toward adopting a penalty for violators.

BID AWARDED FOR SCALED-DOWN SCHOOL

<P>
A bid for construction of a scaled-down middle school in Fillmore was awarded 
Tuesday night to Shirley Brothers, Pasadena contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is scheduled to begin Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
After a staff recommendation, the Fillmore Unified School District board 
accepted the lowest of eight bids to build a gymnasium and bleachers for 
$3,295,000, about $5,000 less than the amount budgeted for the project. 
</P>
<P>
A pavilion included in the design would cost an additional $170,000 if built by 
Shirley Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted to use interest from the $3.4-million middle school fund and 
developer fees to allow the pavilion to be built at the same time as the 
gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
The project should be completed within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Funding is urgently needed for classrooms, library and offices that would 
complete the middle school, according to district officials, who have said 
crowding is severe and worsening in Fillmore's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, voters rejected an $8-million bond issue to build the entire school.

The Moorpark school board, after threatening two weeks ago to throw city 
programs out of all the district's school buildings, has decided to allow the 
programs to remain for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The board had cut off use of all school facilities by the city's park and 
recreation program. The action stemmed from a two-year battle between the city 
and the district over the sale of a closed school in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Patty Waters said a letter sent to the city Friday said "an 
extension to the 30 days can be forthcoming." GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

RACERS STOP SHORT WHEN POLICE STEP IN

<P>
For two elderly runners in a special foot race Tuesday, the red traffic light 
was annoying enough. But the men came to a screeching halt when a policeman 
ticketed them for disobeying the light. 
</P>
<P>
The 3.1-mile race was the opening event of the Sixth Annual Gold Coast Regional 
Senior Olympics of Ventura County. The games draw about 400 men and women 55 
and older for events scheduled over the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremonies, 20 runners left the starting line at the county 
Government Center in Ventura. The two men were leading the pack when they were 
ticketed for going through a red light at Lark Street and Telephone Road. 
</P>
<P>
"They were pretty upset," said Carol Gillespie, a member of the Olympic 
planning committee who helped during the race. Not only that, she said, "The 
policeman held up a whole bunch of runners for 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura police said the patrolman acted correctly in issuing the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic Sgt. Carl Handy said the two men crossed Lark Street against a red 
light and both were nearly hit by cars. He declined to release the names of the 
men. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer felt they were deserving of a citation, and he did exactly what he 
was supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Police Department is usually involved when groups stage races on 
city streets so traffic can be stopped for runners. But he said he did not know 
whether the Olympic organization had notified the department of the race. 
Gillespie didn't know either, and other race officials couldn't be reached. But 
a volunteer was stationed at the Lark Street intersection make sure runners 
didn't dart out into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The ticketing might have put a damper on the race for some, but not Maxine 
Culp. The 67-year-old Ventura woman picked up a silver medal for her 44-minute 
race time. 
</P>
<P>
It was her fourth Ventura County Olympic competition, and she's brought home 
medals from them all. She's foremost a walker, but she trained for the race by 
running through her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hooked on walking about five years ago," the retired registered nurse 
said after the race. She walks three times a week at the Buenaventura Plaza 
mall with the Walk for Life program. 
</P>
<P>
Culp was by no means the oldest competitor in the race. One contestant put down 
her age as 78 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>

PIPE BOMB EXPLODES IN STORM DRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A homemade pipe bomb, the 13th found in the county this year, exploded in a 
Thousand Oaks storm drain Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The county bomb squad -- six sergeants from the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department -- have responded to about two pipe bomb calls per month since 
January, double the number in past years, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's pipe bomb was the fourth found in the county this month, said Sgt. Tom 
Convery of the bomb squad. 
</P>
<P>
"These are one right after another." In May, a teen-ager was injured in 
Thousand Oaks when he and a friend set off a pipe bomb in a car. It caused 
about $2,500 damage to the car and slightly injured the boy's chest and groin. 
</P>
<P>
In July, a pipe bomb exploded in the doorway of a Domino's Pizza shop, also in 
Thousand Oaks, shattering a large window and the glass in the front door. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, deputies suspect that two white males between 18 and 20 
threw the pipe bomb in a storm drain in the 2200 block of Westshore Lane at 
3:25 p.m., Sgt. Joe Braga said. 
</P>
<P>
It exploded about 25 feet from a house but caused no damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Squad members are stumped by the increase in bomb-building. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what has brought this about," Convery said. "Sociologists 
might be able to give you an answer to that, but I can't." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the bombs appear to be built by youths, but others are more 
sophisticated, Braga said. 
</P>
<P>
Convery added that it disturbs the squad when children handle explosives 
"because you know somebody's going to get hurt down the road. But it really 
starts to get spooky when you have adults running around doing this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
In his 12 years on the squad, Convery said, this year is the first that he's 
seen such a steady flow of incidents. In 1988, the squad responded to eight 
pipe bomb calls and in 1989, six. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

CITY COUNCIL SEEKS REZONING MANEUVER; 
</P>
<P>
WARNER RIDGE: DESIGNATING 21.5 ACRES FOR MINIMAL COMMERCIAL USE WOULD ALLOW 
CONTINUED EFFORTS TO BLOCK A LARGE DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council is attempting to comply with an unfavorable court 
order in the long and bitter squabble over development of Warner Ridge in 
Woodland Hills -- and still block large-scale commercial construction there. 
</P>
<P>
In a closed session Tuesday, the council gave preliminary approval to a law 
that would rezone the ridge for commercial use, thus bringing the zoning and 
community plan provisions into agreement, as a Superior Court judge ordered. 
The judge's order had appeared to be a step ahead for the site's would-be 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
But the law the council recommended Tuesday would allow only minimal commercial 
development, far short of what the developer says is economically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
That could still give Councilwoman Joy Picus a victory in her campaign to 
prevent construction of a major office development on the ridge. 
</P>
<P>
Picus has been fighting to limit construction on the ridge to single-family 
houses in response to complaints by some Woodland Hills homeowners in her 
district. 
</P>
<P>
She refused to comment Tuesday on the specific limits of the proposed 
ordinance, which will be brought back to the council for a vote on Oct. 3, but 
predicted the developer "won't be happy with it." 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable City Hall sources, who asked not to be identified, said the 
ordinance would allow only 235,000 square feet of office space -- with 
buildings no taller than three stories -- on the 21.5-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, a partnership of The Spound Co. and Johnson Wax Development Co., 
originally sought city permits to build an 810,000-square-foot commercial 
project, consisting of several office towers of three to seven stories. Last 
month the partnership offered a compromise plan for 540,000 square feet of 
commercial and retail space and 350 residential units. 
</P>
<P>
With Tuesday's action, the council was trying to comply with a Sept. 11 order 
by Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski, ruling on a complaint by the developer 
after Picus got the council to rezone the ridge in January for single-family 
houses to block the project. The judge ordered the city to bring the ridge's 
zoning and its designation under the city plan -- which was for commercial use 
-- into agreement by Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Robert McMurry, attorney for the developer, agreed that the council zoning 
proposal would comply with Zebrowski's order. But, he said, it would not stop a 
lawsuit filed against the city by his client that seeks tens of millions of 
dollars in damages. 
</P>
<P>
"This does not permit an economical use of the property, and it's not going to 
settle the litigation," McMurry said. "They've put the lowest amount of 
commercial zoning on this that they can." 
</P>
<P>
McMurry said the developer also has other causes of action against the city 
that have yet to be tested in court, including a charge that the city's 
decision to zone the property for single-family development constituted an 
illegal "taking of the property." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the actions it is taking to comply, the city plans to appeal 
Zebrowski's ruling in a bid to reauthorize residential-only zoning on the 
property, Picus said.

SHOOTING OF 3 CALLED ATYPICAL OF GANGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A drive-by shooting in Ventura that left three men injured Sunday was not a 
typical gang attack, Police Sgt. Bob Anderson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a gang shooting, one or two shots are usually fired from a speeding vehicle 
at unsuspecting victims, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's incident, eight to 10 shots were fired, and evidence suggests that 
the gunshots came from two directions, Anderson said. The victims did not 
return fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Michael Hart, 20, of Fillmore and Michael Wade, 26, and Noe Perez, 30, of 
Ventura were in fair but stable condition Tuesday with broken bones, a Ventura 
Medical Center spokesman said. The three victims were standing in the 2400 
block of Channel Drive about 12:30 a.m. Sunday when they were struck in the 
legs by shotgun pellets, Anderson said. SCOTT LAWRENCE

<P>
A container of muriatic acid that found its way into a Ventura recycling bin 
and then was missed by sorters at a recycling center forced the evacuation of 
about 30 workers, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at the Gold Coast Recycling Center in Ventura had to leave the building 
when the gallon container burst and spilled onto the floor after being 
compressed by machinery. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Simmons, information officer for the Ventura Fire Department, said it 
took hazardous material and county environmental health officers three hours to 
clean up the spill, which occurred shortly before 2 p.m. Monday. Simmons said 
no injuries were reported. SCOTT LAWRENCE

HIRING HALL TO CONTINUE AT SAME SITE -- FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Encinitas hiring hall for documented workers has a new six-month lease on 
life -- thanks to a unanimous but acrimonious vote Monday night by a community 
advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
The New Encinitas Community Advisory Board voted to allow the hiring hall to 
continue operating at its present site along El Camino Real near Olivenhain 
Road -- over the objections of several residents at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We did the right thing," Chairwoman Anne Patton said Tuesday, "but not without 
some real acrimony." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Encinitas City Council voted to earmark $34,150 to continue 
operation of the embattled hiring hall for an additional six months. However, 
the hall's temporary land-use permit expires in September, and city officials 
could have been sent looking for a new site if the vote had been reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really happy with the outcome," said Gloria Carranza, the city's 
transients issues coordinator. "We see it as a six-month lease on life." 
</P>
<P>
Carranza, who attended the meeting, said the 9-month-old hiring hall has 
consistently landed jobs for 53% of the average 53 documented migrant workers 
who daily use its services. 
</P>
<P>
But it continually has come under fire from residents who say it is too close 
to their thriving new communities; from city officials who question its 
success, and from migrant advocates, who say it excludes hundreds and perhaps 
thousands of undocumented workers who also have trouble locating work. 
</P>
<P>
The city is reviewing several "light industrial use" sites within its limits 
where it might move the hall, a portable mobile home that now is driven to the 
rural stretch of El Camino Real each morning. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two sites is reportedly a building on Westlake Drive near City Hall, 
which sits along congested Encinitas Boulevard, within sight of Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
Patton said the present site -- despite the objections of residents who 
included one advisory board member -- is best for the time being. "We have 
people who are worried that this is going to become a permanent thing," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"One board member said he was tired of all this type of migrant stuff being 
dumped on New Encinitas. And two other residents spoke out against the hall, 
saying migrants who go there use their yards as a walkway and a bathroom," 
Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just a lot of NIMBYs (Not in My Back Yard) on this board." 
</P>
<P>
Patton said the debate lasted for more than 40 minutes until member Greg Grajek 
approved the lease extension in the 3-0 vote. One member of the five-member 
board was absent and another could not vote on the issue because he lives 
within 300 yards of the area in question. 
</P>
<P>
"For now, this is the right place for that hall," Patton said. "Right now, 
there are few other alternatives in Encinitas. We're mostly built out. So, for 
this kind of use, we're really limited." 
</P>
<P>
But if the City Council later votes to extend funding for the hall for another 
six months, Patton and the other members of the New Encinitas Community 
Advisory Board are going to have another tough decision on their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"If it comes up again in another six months, I can't say how I'll vote," Patton 
said. "I only know how I feel about it right now."

DEAL CLEARS WAY FOR LIMITED MIRAMAR LAKE DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Tuesday unanimously agreed to settle a Scripps 
Ranch developer's lawsuit, saving much of the hillside around Miramar Lake 
while opening the way for construction of about 3,360 housing units. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the city and the development partnership of McMillin-BCED 
brings to a halt a lawsuit the developer filed protesting the City Council's 
action last February, when it approved an emergency interim ordinance 
restricting construction along the lake's northern shore. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the settlement signals the end of the beginning in a long battle 
over development of what is called Miramar Ranch North. Many of the land-use 
agreements contained in the settlement, ranging from amendments to the area's 
community development plan to a specific development agreement with the city, 
must be voted on separately. Some of the votes aren't scheduled until April. 
</P>
<P>
Among the main elements in the complex settlement are: 
</P>
<P>
* Turning a proposed industrial park into a 300-unit multifamily residential 
project. 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing the number of housing units around the lake by 498 to 590, a 
decrease of 54%. 
</P>
<P>
* Increasing the amount of open space in the 1,200-acre development to 255 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing the number of hillside homes in the lake's "viewshed" from about 400 
to approximately 80. 
</P>
<P>
* Moving a proposed alignment of Scripps Ranch Boulevard away from the lake. 
</P>
<P>
* Increasing to six years the construction timetable of the 3,360 housing 
units. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the agreement calls on the developer to consider building a town 
center complex and moving a school site. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also requires the developer to begin building a major roadway in 
the area -- Scripps Ranch North Parkway -- as well as provide money to build a 
library and other public facilities, including the Mercy Road interchange with 
Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the city agreed to the following major points: 
</P>
<P>
* Giving the developer a $24-million credit against future imposition of 
citywide impact fees. 
</P>
<P>
* Essentially exempting the developer from regulations in the city's 
environmental ordinance, formally known as the Resource Protection Ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
* Giving the developer an exemption from any future growth-control ordinance 
approved by the City Council. McMillin-BCED, however, would still be covered by 
any growth-control initiatives placed on the ballot by the public. 
</P>
<P>
* If the developer is delayed or made to stop building because of various 
decisions by the city as outlined in the agreement, the city would be forced to 
reimburse McMillin-BCED millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for the creation of a $56.5-million fund to pay for 
many of the public improvements needed by new growth in Miramar Ranch North. 
</P>
<P>
Various community groups -- such as the Save the Lake Committee -- told the 
City Council they supported the many land-use changes contained in the 
settlement agreement, though they wanted to read and analyze the agreement 
before supporting it 100%. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement itself was only made public Tuesday after it was discussed by the 
council in closed session. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, who represents Scripps Ranch and who played a 
major role in initiating the settlement, said the agreement was a victory for 
the neighborhoods in the area that for several years have fought to be part of 
the political process.

PILOT DOING STUNTS BEFORE FATAL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 62-year-old pilot appeared to be performing aerobatic stunts at too low an 
altitude when his homemade plane crashed and killed him, federal investigators 
were told Tuesday by witnesses to the Poway accident. 
</P>
<P>
William Herman Parrigin of Lakeside was flying the the single-engine RV-4 when 
the crashed occurred about 5:30 p.m. Monday at the east end of south Poway 
Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses who were watching Parrigin's stunts said he seemed to be only about 
600 feet above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Federal flight laws for aerobatic flying say that the plane should be at least 
1,500 feet above ground, said Jeff Reynolds, an investigator for the Federal 
Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him about 30 seconds to a minute before he went down," said Scott 
Jennette, an aerospace analyst who was standing outside the General Dynamics 
plant about half a mile from the crash site. "I saw him do about two barrel 
rolls and then he just took a nose dive straight to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators still must examine the aircraft further and conduct additional 
interviews with witnesses before making an official determination on the cause 
of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
After striking the ground the plane apparently skidded across a dirt field and 
went over an embankment, where it broke apart, said Mike Kolesar, a production 
control supervisor at General Dynamics who drove out to the site after he 
witnessed the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Parrigin took off from Gillespie Field in El Cajon just after 5 p.m. He never 
radioed that he was in trouble or needed help, said an air traffic controller 
in the airport tower. 
</P>
<P>
Parrigin began buying sections of the airplane piecemeal in 1984 and 
assemblying it, said Dick Smith, general manager of Van's Aircraft Inc. near 
Portland, Ore., the company that sold Parrigin the parts. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration certified the plane as airworthy in 1986, 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
An RV-4 is a small two-person plane made of sheet metal that reaches a top 
speed of 205 m.p.h. It has a wing span of 23 feet and a length of just more 
than 20 feet, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are uncertain where Parrigin was headed when he took off from 
Gillespie because he was not required to submit a flight plan, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
But witnesses said the area where Parrigin crashed is known as a haven for 
pilots to do stunt flying as well as chase each other around in the air in mock 
"dog fights."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 MEN LOSE PART OF FEET IN CABLE ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two workers each had part of a foot severed when a steel cable came loose in a 
Lancaster construction accident Tuesday, the Los Angeles County Fire Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 8:10 a.m. accident occurred at Avenue E and 20th Street West as a work crew 
for Western Utility Contractors used machinery to pull a quarter-inch-thick 
steel cable down the street next to a construction site where a sewer main was 
to be placed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the cable snapped or came loose and entangled two men on 
the crew, officials said. One victim's right foot was severed at the ankle by 
the cable; the other man lost about one-third of his left foot, firefighters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, both about 45 and from Lancaster, were taken to the Antelope 
Valley Medical Center, where both were in serious condition, officials said. 
Hospital officials, firefighters and accident investigators declined to 
identify the men. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Rice, a spokesman for Cal/OSHA, said an investigation of the accident was 
begun Tuesday, but the cause was not known. 
</P>
<P>
After the victims were taken to the hospital, paramedics Fred Carter and Jim 
Larue returned to the accident site to thank other members of the work crew for

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 ARRESTED AT AIRPORT ON DRUG CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were arrested this week on drug-related charges after trying to pass 
security at Burbank Airport with about $350,000 worth of cocaine, Burbank 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Humberto Alvarez, 23, of Sepulveda and Enrique Magdaleno, 23, of Sylmar had 
about nine pounds of cocaine hidden under their clothes and in a suitcase, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities began searching Alvarez about 6 p.m. Monday after he tried to pass 
a security checkpoint and set off an alarm, police said. A security guard 
discovered more than five pounds of cocaine under the front of Alvarez's shirt 
and tucked in the back of his pants, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Magdaleno was in line to be searched as well, but ran when Alvarez set off the 
alarm, police said. Police later discovered Magdaleno hiding in a nearby 
bathroom holding a brown suitcase. After obtaining his permission to open the 
suitcase, police found another four pounds of cocaine, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they did not know where the two were headed. They were being held 
in Burbank Jail in lieu of $500,000 bail each. Arraignment was scheduled today 
in Burbank Municipal Court.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRANSIENT STABBED OUTSIDE TUJUNGA HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 44-year-old man was fatally stabbed shortly after walking out of a friend's 
house in Tujunga, Los Angeles police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, a transient, was stabbed at 9:30 p.m. in front of a house in the 
10300 block of Fernglen Avenue, Detective Al Ferrand said. His name was not 
released because detectives had not yet notified his family. 
</P>
<P>
"He had apparently just walked out to the front of the house and shortly 
thereafter came back in with a stab wound," Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim collapsed inside the house and died. Ferrand said detectives had not 
determined the motive for the slaying or located any witnesses who saw the 
attack or a suspect.

A transient charged in the stabbing death of a North Park man pleaded innocent 
Tuesday and was ordered held in County Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Alan Bowles, 25, is accused of murder in the death of Ken Ruga, 43, who 
was stabbed repeatedly Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bowles is also accused of committing battery upon a police officer during his 
arrest. San Diego Police Officer Catherine Decker was taken to a hospital 
Friday after she suffered a gash over her left eye that required six stitches

</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Gale Kaneshiro ordered a preliminary hearing for Oct. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gordon Davis asked that bail not be set considering the 
violent nature of the crime and that the defendant was a transient. Public

WHITSON DEFEATS ASTROS

<P>
If the San Diego Padres had played every team the way they played the Houston 
Astros, they'd be running away with the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball is a funny game and nobody has mastered it yet. But some years you 
can just beat certain teams," San Diego's Ed Whitson said Tuesday night after 
pitching the Padres to an 8-1 victory over the Astros. The Padres wound up 14-4 
against Houston, including the last eight in a row. It's the most games San 
Diego has won in a season against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing now they way we thought we would play all year. Unfortunately, 
we didn't put it together earlier," Whitson (13-8) said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I can think of how we've done so well against Houston is that 
we match up better against them," Manager Greg Riddoch added. "Our pitchers are 
more effective against their hitters then against other teams." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, who went seven innings and gave up a run and six hits, impressed 
Houston Manager Art Howe. 
</P>
<P>
"He always pitches us tough and they usually play us tough. They've been as 
tough on us as any team in the league," Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
Home runs by Joe Carter, Jack Clark and Bip Roberts made it easy for Whitson. 
Loser Bill Gullickson (9-13) was tagged for six runs and eight hits, including 
the three home runs, in 4 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when Carter singled, stole 
second and scored on a single by Mike Pagliarulo. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres made it 3-0 in the third on Carter's 24th home run, a two-run shot 
following a walk to Clark. Garry Templeton's single and Roberts' ninth home run 
increased the lead to 5-0 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Clark hit his 23rd homer in the fifth and added a two-run single off Jim Clancy 
in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"The home run came on a fastball up in the zone. With two strikes I was ready 
for a fastball, like I always am. It was a bad pitch, but I hit it good," Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Houston scored in the fifth on an RBI single by Rafael Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Harris and Craig Lefferts each pitched one scoreless in relief for San 
Diego.

HENNING, BEATHARD PUT THEIR MONEY ON TOLLIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The future is now, and torturous as that may be in the coming weeks, it is 
Billy Joe Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no more quarterback debate. No more Mark Vlasic. 
</P>
<P>
While sentiment among fans may run deep for Vlasic, his comeback story and the 
steady Dan Fouts-like poise he strikes, it carries no impact with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Barring injury, the rest of the season will be dedicated to the education of 
the strong-armed Tolliver. It's a decision that has been made by Coach Dan 
Henning, and one that has been solidly seconded by General Manager Bobby 
Beathard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing negative about Mark; he's a fine quarterback," Beathard said. 
"But you just have to hope your judgment is right. And I think the decision 
that Billy's got to be the guy is a wise one." 
</P>
<P>
It's business, and Beathard has been acclaimed as one of the best in the 
business in assessing talent. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking ahead, I think Tolliver is a big-time guy," Beathard said. "And it's a 
great opportunity now for Billy to get this much experience early in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to go with the decision to start Vlasic to open the season," he said. 
"He deserved that; he outplayed Billy. But what we learned, without hurting 
Mark, is maybe that's as high as you go there. I don't know if Mark's capable 
of being the big-play quarterback. Billy is." 
</P>
<P>
There remains tremendous respect and admiration for Vlasic within the 
organization, but if Tolliver stumbles in Cleveland or against Houston, it 
won't open the door any wider for Vlasic's return to the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
And Tolliver will stumble. He threw for 284 yards and two touchdowns against 
the Bengals, but his interception at the Cincinnati two-yard line gutted the 
Chargers' chances of icing their first victory. 
</P>
<P>
He still throws the football too hard when the situation demands the delicate 
touch, and like Nolan Ryan on a bad night, his fastball is going to sail high 
and over the head of a wide-open receiver every so often. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there are many teams that have decided to go with a young 
quarterback that don't pay the price early on," Beathard said. "It presents a 
challenge for the coach, and for the players, because you can't let yourself 
get down because of mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
The public, however, may not be so understanding. They have seen poise and 
promise in Vlasic, and he was 2-0 before suffering a serious knee injury in 
1988. And when the Chargers began this exhibition season 3-0, it was the 
comeback kid standing in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some big-time weapons and we have to have some hope in a game that we 
can make the big play," Beathard said. "And I'm not sure with Vlasic anybody 
thought he had big-play capability. Billy has, and that makes him exciting. And 
he's going to get better and better. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a team," he said, "that has the luxury of keeping Billy on the bench 
and feeding him piecemeal or whatever. It's throw him in." 
</P>
<P>
On-the-job training in the National Football League can have a stunning effect 
on the psyche of a young quarterback. But land sakes, we're talking about a 
hard-headed Texan here. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately for Billy and the team," Beathard said, "he's got the temperment 
that you can do this. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy's not the kind of kid who is going to be crushed or lose confidence when 
he makes mistakes. I think he takes losses hard because he's a competitor and 
he doesn't want to be the guy that is the biggest reason for letting the team 
down. But we won't look at him in that way." 
</P>
<P>
The opposition will. It will understand that its best chance of defeating the 
Chargers will be to stay away from the defense, and go after the inexperienced 
quarterback. Make him make mistakes, and its prospects for victory improve 
immensely. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to live with some of that," Beathard said. "But our game plans are 
designed for two things. It's to take advantage of Billy's big-play capability, 
and also to give him support. To put him in positions where everything isn't 
resting on his shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins adopted a similar approach in 1985 with an inexperienced Jay 
Schroeder, and he threw for 4,109 yards. "The system took a lot of pressure off 
him," Beathard said. "And I think that's what the coaches want to do here with 
Billy." 
</P>
<P>
The pressure, however, is on the Chargers. For the third year in a row, they 
have opened the season 0-2. They have blown a 14-10 lead in Dallas, and a 13-0 
lead against the Bengals in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Held scoreless to date in second-half play, the Chargers now go against a Brown 
defense that has yet to allow a point in either the third or fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"You never feel happy after a loss, but I'm sure feeling different than how I 
felt after Dallas," Beathard said. "After Dallas I really wondered what was 
going on. I was really down. But this last game gave me hope that we have 
something here if we can cut down on the mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the team played hard against Cincinnati, but it's typical of a team 
that's not there yet," he said. "The Bengals made some mistakes and overcame 
them; we made some mistakes and couldn't overcome them." 
</P>
<P>
Patience does not come easy to Beathard, but history reminds him of its payoff. 
In 1981 he hired Joe Gibbs to be the Redskins' head coach, and after Gibbs' 
first five games on the sideline, Washington was 0-5. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't think it was hard in Washington? I was called every name in the 
book," Beathard said. "But you have to make your plans and follow them." 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins stayed on course and finished 8-8 that season. The following year 
they won the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look down the road; if we don't, we're making a big mistake," 
Beathard said. "We've got a young and inexperienced quarterback and there's 
going to be things that happen. All the pieces are not there in personnel, but 
hell, I'd love to win Sunday. And we can. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to see fans disappointed, and I know it's not the start everybody 
wanted," he said. "But we'll get there. You'd like it all to happen in giant 
steps -- it's just impossible. But we'll get there."

CS NORTHRIDGE, ON VERGE OF UPSETTING USC, FALTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge has shown repeatedly that it can play with Top 20 
competition in its inaugural Division I season, but the Matadors demonstrated 
again Tuesday night that they are still this close to upsetting the nation's 
powerhouse teams. 
</P>
<P>
Against 15th-ranked and four-time national champion Southern Cal, visiting CSUN 
came within two points of winning the match, but the Trojans forced a fifth 
game and prevailed, 12-15, 15-10, 7-15, 19-17, 15-10. 
</P>
<P>
"We had them and then they slipped by us," said Northridge setter Beth Welch, 
who had 44 assists and seven aces. "We're on the edge. We just need a little 
push to get us off the edge and on top. We are coming so close." 
</P>
<P>
In Coach Walt Ker's mind it was the little things that made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"One more serve in-bounds, one less bad pass . . . better communication," Ker 
said. "I had two thoughts for my team -- one, that it was the best match of the 
year, and two, that the little things, passing and serving could have allowed 
us to walk away with a 3-1 win." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, CSUN dropped to 0-3 against Top 20 teams, 9-5 overall. USC extended 
its win streak to five and improved to 5-3 behind the the play of 6-foot-2 
All-American candidate Lonise Norfleet, who had 27 kills, nine in the second 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the difference was the play of Lonise. She just had a career match," 
USC Coach Lisa Love said. "Although I shouldn't say that because that's the way 
she's played all year." 
</P>
<P>
Of all the Matadors, Welch knew what to expect from Norfleet -- they were 
roommates at the U.S. Olympic Festival -- and USC, a team she played against 
the past three years while at Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's confidence stemmed from winning the first and third games and 
maintaining momentum at the beginning of the fourth game as first server Welch 
reeled off three aces in a row and Patricia Fitzsimmons put a spike down for a 
4-0 advantage. But USC came back on four kills by Norfleet, an ace by Megan 
McCallister and a CSUN error to gain a 6-4 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The match seesawed from there with USC scoring three in a row to take a 14-13 
lead. But CSUN tied the score, 14-14, and a long Norfleet hit brought the 
Matadors to match point. 
</P>
<P>
USC took the lead on two kills by Katie Haller, but Kathleen Dixon forced a 
16-16 tie with a kill. Two sideouts later, a USC error again made it match 
point for CSUN, 17-16, but a kill by Norfleet gave USC the sideout. A hitting 
error by reserve Jill Trehearne tied the score, 17-17, and Trehearne's block a 
moment later earned CSUN the sideout. 
</P>
<P>
But CSUN lost its advantage on a kill by McCallister and the Trojans scored the 
final points on a block and an ace by freshman Missy McCaw for a 19-17 win that 
forced a fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
USC never trailed in the decisive game.

STATWATCH: GRANADA HILLS QUARTERBACK THROWS A 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If sharing the wealth helps keep a team happy, then the receivers at Granada 
Hills High must be flashing lots of enamel. Friday's win was cause for a 
goal-line-to-goal-line grin. 
</P>
<P>
Senior quarterback Bryan Martin completed 17 of 22 passes for 166 yards in a 
26-10 victory over Lynwood, and the 17 completions were distributed among seven 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo Finney (seven receptions), Brett Washington (four), Kyron Motton (two), 
Earl Andrews, Robert Haywood, John Moss and Felix Shin each caught at least one 
pass. Lynwood might find it difficult to believe, but the Highlanders were 
without their best receiver, senior Eric Moss, who was sidelined because of a 
shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
"We were substituting a lot because a bunch of our guys go both ways," Granada 
Hills co-Coach Tom Harp said. "With Eric Moss out, we needed to play different 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Moss, no relation to John, said that he expects to play Saturday against 
Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
Defense: The Canyon defense, dubbed the "No-Names" by Coach Harry Welch, has 
allowed just two touchdowns in its first three games against Honolulu St. 
Louis, Hart and Notre Dame. Canyon is allowing an average of 62 yards on the 
ground. . . . Quartz Hill, for all of its offensive prowess (102 points and 800 
yards rushing in two games), is even stingier on defense than Golden League 
rival Canyon. In two games, the Rebels have surrendered 40 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore is one of three area teams to notch shutouts in its first two games 
(St. Francis and Paraclete are the others) with a 26-0 win over Pater Noster 
and a 17-0 victory over Oak Park, which scored 63 points in its opener against 
Leffingwell Christian. Fillmore's defense, led by linebacker Anthony Chessani 
and defensive backs Art Sosa and Steve Clinton, has allowed a total of 248 
yards, 71 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Offense: Life after Tim Gutierrez has been tough for Santa Clara. The former 
Saints quarterback, a redshirt at San Diego State, passed for 7,272 yards in 
his three-year career. In two games this fall, Santa Clara has gained 72 yards 
through the air. . . . Canyon has punted just once this season. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando's return to the wishbone was successful in Friday's 23-0 defeat of 
Fremont. Running backs Leonice Brown (79 yards), Will Taylor (73), LaKarlos 
Townsend (42) and Johnnie Brown (six) combined for 200 yards in 33 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Records: If not for intra-city play, the three Burbank schools still would be 
looking for their first win. Burroughs and Bell-Jeff are each 0-2 and have been 
outscored a combined 131-14. Burbank High posted the city's first win with a 
22-14 victory over Bell-Jeff last week after dropping its opener to Hoover, 
24-7. . . . On the other side of the ledger, Hoover and Glendale have kept 
their city unbeaten in four games.

General Manager Bobby Beathard said Tuesday the Chargers will add former San 
Francisco linebacker Steve Hendrickson to the roster if Billy Ray Smith is 
placed on injured reserve today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not done yet, but I think that's what is going to happen," Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
Team doctors have recommended at least four weeks of rest for Smith, who 
suffers from strained stomach muscles. 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker Henry Rolling will take Smith's place in the starting 
lineup, and will be backed up by inside linebacker Cedric Figaro. If 
Hendrickson joins the club, he will assume Rolling's special teams duties. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers took a look at wide receiver/punt returner and former Lincoln High 
School player Lew Barnes Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes was released earlier this year by Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The fans may have booed him on introduction Sunday, but Lynn said it won't be 
long before first-round pick Junior Seau turns the jeers into cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"He will be an impact player by the end of this season if he continues to 
develop," Lynn said. "There's no doubt in my mind that he's going to be a great 
player in this league." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn also told reporters that he's heard rumors out of Cleveland that Bernie 
Kosar might be replaced by Mike Pagel Sunday as the Browns' starting 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns said Tuesday, that although Kosar has been sacked 10 times in the 
first two games this season, he will start against the Chargers. T.J. SIMERS

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: RIGGINS MAKES SUDDEN IMPACT; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: IN FIRST GAME FOR CALABASAS AFTER ABORTED TRANSFER ATTEMPT, BACK 
GAINS 208 YARDS.

When Calabasas High running back Damon Riggins dashed toward Agoura last month, 
his teammates weren't dashing ahead opening holes. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, their hopes were dashed. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins, a two-year starter at running back and safety, wanted out of the 
Coyotes' three-legged program. Calabasas' roster had dwindled from 35 players 
to eight at one point this summer, and Riggins wanted to use his deceptive 
moves to get out of Calabasas once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I heard, (my teammates) thought I let them down, and I don't blame 
them for being mad at me," Riggins said. 
</P>
<P>
But Riggins was soon back in the Coyote huddle. Agoura and Calabasas are 
members of the Las Virgenes Unified School District, and Riggins failed to meet 
requirements for an intra-district transfer. After 2 1/2 weeks of practice with 
Agoura, he was sent back to Calabasas on Sept. 6. The team -- then 12 players 
strong -- voted to accept him back. 
</P>
<P>
"They just told me they were glad to have me," Riggins said. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins, a 5-foot-9, 185-pound senior, was ineligible for Calabasas' opening 
game Sept. 7, a 30-13 loss to Bishop Diego, because he had not participated in 
10 practices. He regained his eligibility last week and opened the season with 
a stunning performance. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins rushed for 208 yards in 19 carries, scored on touchdown runs of 76 and 
49 yards, intercepted a pass. In addition, he had a 96-yard kickoff return 
nullified by a holding penalty. With Riggins back in the fold, the Coyotes, all 
15 of them, defeated St. Genevieve, 28-14. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the game, I couldn't wait to get out there," Riggins said. "I knew my 
teammates were questioning whether I was going to take it seriously, and I 
wanted to show them I'm out to give 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins, who rushed for 660 yards as a junior, was one of the few bright spots 
in a decaying program that was 1-9 last season and 4-16 the past two. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 35 players who participated in Calabasas' spring drills, only eight 
appeared for the opening day of practice in August. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins was one of the defectors. He had moved to Agoura, a former Frontier 
League rival, pending approval of his transfer. Agoura moved this season to the 
Marmonte League. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't getting along with some people at Calabasas, and I was making new 
friends at Agoura," Riggins said. "It seemed to be a better situation." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins initially strained his relationship with his Calabasas teammates last 
spring when he was indefinitely suspended from the team because of an on-campus 
incident. His dash west further weakened the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"I was discouraged, like just about everybody else, but we knew he'd be an 
asset," said senior Ron Adelman, Calabasas' quarterback and a team captain. 
"When we met to decide about taking Damon back, we had only 13 people on the 
team. If we didn't take him back, we were at risk of not having a team, and 
that just wasn't worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins sought to solidify his support among his teammates with a strong 
showing Friday as a running back and linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I had to help out and let them know that I want to play for them," 
Riggins said. "I wish I had been able to help out for the first game." 
</P>
<P>
That thought wasn't lost on Adelman. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had had him the first game, we'd be 2-0," he said.

'SUPER SUMMIT' CALLED TO TACKLE BUDGET CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: EIGHT WHITE HOUSE AND CONGRESSIONAL NEGOTIATORS WILL TRY TO BREAK THE 
DEADLOCK ON SPENDING CUTS. SOME AGREEMENT ON TAXES SEEN.

<P>
Deadlocked despite months of negotiations aimed at a $500-billion 
deficit-reduction agreement, White House officials and congressional leaders 
agreed Tuesday to convene an eight-man "super summit" to try to break the 
stalemate before massive spending cuts strike on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats and Republicans blamed each other for the impasse. President Bush, 
flying off to make campaign speeches for GOP candidates in Colorado and 
California, said that he could not predict what would happen next in the talks, 
which have dragged on since May 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody, they tell me, agrees that they've come quite a way, but 
it's not done by a long shot," Bush said about the budget negotiations. "Well, 
just let them hammer it out." 
</P>
<P>
Documents obtained by The Times indicate that negotiators tentatively have 
agreed on $59 billion in tax increases on luxury goods, cigarettes, liquor, 
beer and wine, insurance companies and airline passengers between now and 1995. 
If the proposals become final, the tax on cigarettes would rise by 4 cents a 
pack in 1991 and again in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tentative agreement, a 10% luxury tax would be imposed on buyers of 
all private planes as well as cars and boats selling for more than $30,000. The 
tax, which also would be assessed on jewelry worth more than $5,000, electronic 
goods worth more than $1,000 and furs costing $500 or more, would be 10% of the 
price above the threshold figures. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes on distilled spirits, beer and wine would be raised by a total of $13.6 
billion over the next five years under the tentative accords. A $100-million 
annual tax would be levied on production of ozone-depleting chemicals. 
Corporations would not be able to deduct interest on money borrowed to pay 
taxes, generating an extra $4.5 billion in revenue between now and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
But the two sides remained far apart on Democratic proposals for a stiff energy 
tax, a 20% surtax on families with yearly incomes above $200,000, and tax 
breaks that would benefit working families and people in lower tax brackets. 
Republicans want tax cuts for investors, enterprise zones, oil drillers and 
family savings accounts, while proposing to end the deduction of state and 
local income taxes for upper-income taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Without an agreement or an unexpected relaxation in the Gramm-Rudman 
deficit-reduction law, about $100 billion in spending cuts would be triggered 
Oct. 1, forcing large furloughs of government workers, major reductions in some 
federal programs and severe cuts in the military budget. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides disagreed over whether the President's repeated demand for a 
sharp cut in the tax on capital gains -- profits from the sale of stocks, bonds 
and other assets -- is the chief stumbling block to an accord. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Democrats said that Bush's insistence on reducing capital gains taxes 
would result in windfall benefits for the very rich without offsetting tax 
increases to make the entire package equitable for middle-income and 
lower-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, at a Republican fund-raising lunch in Denver, denied that capital gains 
tax cuts would be a "tax break for the rich." He characterized the proposal as 
needed to "spur savings, encourage investment, expand jobs . . . and increase 
competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), breaking his customary silence on 
details of the bargaining, said that the central problem is Bush's 
determination to get a capital gains tax cut in the package. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration wants to hand (wealthy Americans) a major tax reduction and 
at the same time have no effective offsetting contribution from them in the 
deficit reduction effort, and that, I think, is unjustifiable," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), however, said that other issues 
besides capital gains continue to stand in the way of an accord. Gingrich 
termed the Democratic complaints "absolute baloney." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to take the capital gains issue to the country," said one Midwestern 
Democrat, sensing political advantage in his party's position that Republicans 
favor tax breaks for the well-to-do. 
</P>
<P>
In their latest proposal, presented Monday night, Democrats said that they had 
made a major concession by withdrawing earlier proposals for $45 billion in new 
spending over the next five years and advocating only $5 billion in additional 
outlays in fiscal 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the talks broke off without accord, and Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.) said that it would take a "miracle" for the negotiators to 
conclude a budget agreement in the three weeks remaining in this session of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Foley and the top Democratic and Republican leaders from each chamber met for 
an hour Tuesday with the Bush Administration negotiating team -- White House 
Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, Budget Director Richard G. Darman and Treasury 
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and his GOP 
counterpart, Rep. Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), announced that eight key 
participants would make renewed efforts toward a compromise in meetings at the 
Capitol after the end of bargaining at secluded Andrews Air Force Base in 
nearby Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"The talks have not collapsed," Gephardt said. "They have moved to a different 
stage." 
</P>
<P>
The session today will include Foley, Gephardt and Michel from the House; Dole 
and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) from the Senate and the 
three Administration officials. Left off at the new stage are such contentious 
participants as Gingrich and Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), chairman of the 
Senate Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, congressional sources said that the Senate and House participants 
who are taking part in this stage of the negotiations are more 
compromise-minded than some of those who participated in the Andrews talks.

UPDATE / LOUISIANA BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
SENATOR TURNS ANGRY POPULIST IN RACE WITH EX-KKK LEADER 
</P>

<P>
For 18 years, U.S. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston has kept a low profile. So low, in 
fact, that one poll earlier this year showed that the three-term Democratic 
incumbent was unknown by almost a majority of Louisiana voters. 
</P>
<P>
But, as he runs for reelection in an open primary on Oct. 6, Johnston has 
become a household word -- largely because his principal opponent is state Rep. 
David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard with connections to the American 
Nazi Party. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, as the usually quiet Johnston travels the hot and dusty campaign 
trial, he has adopted the style of an angry, voice-raising populist -- a style 
that has brought success to many other Louisiana politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had done one-tenth of what David Duke has done, one-tenth, why, they'd 
ride me out of town on a rail," Johnston told a group of supporters in the tiny 
town of Farmerville. "Why, this is a man who has celebrated Adolf Hitler's 
birthday every year." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is also an opportunity for Johnston to rid himself of an albatross 
that has long haunted his career -- the perception that he has never had a 
serious opponent and has, as one writer put it, "led a charmed political life." 
In many ways he has: He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 after his chief 
opponent, incumbent Allen Ellender died, and has won two landslide elections 
since then against token opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Skepticism about Johnston's ability to win against a stronger opponent 
heightened this summer as polls showed his support dropping from more than 60% 
to less than 45%. Meanwhile, Duke, a charismatic figure on the hustings who has 
tapped into a large vein of anger and alienation among Louisiana voters 
frustrated by the state's economic recession, has been attracting far larger 
crowds than Johnston, and his support has grown from less than 15% to almost 
30%. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Mann, Johnston's campaign spokesman, said the senator's tactic of attacking 
Duke "would probably have been a foolish mistake in a normal election simply 
because Johnston is the well-established incumbent and Duke is the challenger. 
But this is not a normal election. Just as many people in Louisiana know Duke 
as . . . know Johnston, but a lot of people still don't know about Duke's past, 
so the senator has felt the need to educate them." 
</P>
<P>
To Susan F. Howell, a political pollster for the University of New Orleans, 
Johnston's decision to attack Duke is a wise one. "At this point, Johnston is 
on the verge of winning . . . he's very near having a majority of votes. 
Attacking Duke may bring Johnston enough undecided voters to push him over the 
top." 
</P>
<P>
But Jim McPherson, state coordinator for Duke, thinks the Johnston attack "is 
an act of desperation. If you're an 18-year incumbent, normally you'd have the 
high ground and you'd talk about all of your great accomplishments and your 
record, but here's Johnston reduced to having to attack his opponent . . . . 
He's in trouble and he knows it." 
</P>
<P>
The Duke forces think Johnston's greatest vulnerability may be his voting 
record in Washington, a record Duke, running as a Republican, repeatedly 
attacks. Duke likes to remind voters that it was Johnston who led the Southern 
Democratic charge against U.S. Supreme Court nominee Robert H. Bork, thereby 
almost ensuring Bork's rejection in the Senate, and that Johnston has continued 
to vote in favor of affirmative action legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But, in this battle of the records, the Johnston campaign has been equally 
vociferous, pointing not only to Duke's past Nazi and KKK affiliations but also 
to a disclosure that Duke underwent extensive plastic surgery and once wrote 
manuals on how women can sexually satisfy their male partners. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of isolated rural areas in this state that don't get any of 
the big urban newspapers who've been doing all of this reporting on Duke's 
past," Mann said. "For the people in those areas, this is all news."

<P>
On a sweltering Brooklyn night, two prostitutes emerge from the eerie 
desolation of garbage-strewn lots into the orange cone of a street light. One 
of them disappears down the street with a man. The other woman, Donna, 29, 
moves cautiously as if beckoned by the glaring red brake lights toward a van 
that has just pulled over. 
</P>
<P>
Tall and slender, wearing no make-up, casually but neatly dressed, she steps 
into the van with three strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, she is paid $10 -- three times more than she charges for a sexual 
favor, five times more than the cost of a vial of crack in her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
All Donna did was take an AIDS blood test administered by Dr. Joyce Wallace, a 
Greenwich Village internist. If Donna shows up at Wallace's office for the test 
results, she gets another $20. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace may have been the first doctor in the United States to study AIDS in 
women, beginning with an AIDS patient who was referred to her in 1982. Now she 
leads the fight against AIDS infection in prostitutes in New York, one of most 
difficult battlegrounds in a difficult war. 
</P>
<P>
Infection rates among prostitutes have soared from 8% to well over 30% since 
Wallace started keeping track five years ago. So far, she has tested 1,000 New 
York streetwalkers. Of those infected with the HIV virus, almost three-fourths 
took drugs using shared needles, a common infection route. About 7% are not IV 
users, but reported having had unprotected sex with an intravenous drug user. 
</P>
<P>
Using grants from the Centers for Disease Control, New York state and Ansell 
Inc., which manufactures condoms, Wallace pursues her twin goals of building a 
data base on this explosive problem and trying to help the victims of the 
disease by counseling and medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
With red hair to match her firebrand disposition, Wallace, 49, cruises the 
streets in a van pressing her search. She regularly ignores her driver's 
concern for her safety. When he refused to stop in one area, Wallace hopped out 
of the moving van to solicit participants for the AIDS test. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told her that she's alone out there," the driver, John Reid, said angrily 
as he pulled over in Williamsburg, another drug-ravaged neighborhood, to await 
her return. "I'm not going to fight off some big guy. She's so stupid! Look at 
that gang," he said pointing to a group of young men. "This is dangerous!" 
</P>
<P>
Wallace returned without incident. The white Street Outreach van rolled on as 
it does four nights a week, visiting various New York red light districts 
testing, counseling and handing out free condoms. 
</P>
<P>
On that night with Dr. Wallace, five prostitutes were tested and three appeared 
certain to have the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Diane, 37, a mother of four, showed inch-long tracks of needle scars on her 
wrist while Wallace was drawing blood to confirm a previous positive test. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know what it means that you tested positive for HIV?," Wallace asked. 
Diane nodded. "But I feel good," she objected. "I'm getting fatter and fatter." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace urged Diane to have her 2-year-old daughter tested for AIDS. But Diane 
went back out giggling. 
</P>
<P>
Lois, 36, a lively woman with long black-painted nails and a ready smile, asked 
the doctor about two long swollen areas running from her chin down her neck. 
"If it is, God forbid, that disease, it will go away, won't it?" she asked 
plaintively. Her eyes filled with tears as she quickly crossed herself. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace suddenly looked older as she held Lois' hand, slowly explaining the 
disease. "Touch it again," Lois pleaded with the doctor, as though she hoped 
the medical touch would make it magically go away. 
</P>
<P>
After massaging the area some more, Wallace urged Lois to come to her office in 
two weeks. "I'll give you another $20," she called as Lois left the van. 
</P>
<P>
"She's got it," Wallace said quietly, almost to herself. "A chain of swollen 
lymphs like that. What's so sad is she had to have been infected recently. It 
could have been prevented," she shook her head sadly. 
</P>
<P>
"A girl like that, with personality. You know what I'm saying?" she leaned 
earnestly toward Reid who quietly shared a part of her despair. "With 
personality!" she stressed, and then fell back on the couch exhausted, rubbing 
her face in her hands.

U.S. REBUKES JORDAN'S KING FOR HOSTING ARAB RADICALS;

DIPLOMACY: THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS 'APPALLED.' THE MONARCH IS ALSO MILDLY 
CRITICIZED FOR ACCEPTING IRAQI OIL.

The Bush Administration delivered a stinging rebuke to King Hussein of Jordan 
on Tuesday for hosting a conference of anti-American Arab radicals in Amman, 
while criticizing him only mildly for meeting 40% of his kingdom's petroleum 
needs with Iraqi oil. 
</P>
<P>
"We are appalled by the statements that were made at that conference," State 
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in response to questions about a 
three-day meeting of Arab radicals and guerrillas. They warned of terrorist 
attacks "against the American interests everywhere" and called for the 
overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
"We were surprised and dismayed that this conference took place, and we have 
told the Jordanians so," she said. In a veiled hint that the meeting could 
cause severe damage to four decades of friendly U.S.-Jordanian relations, she 
added: "We want to work with Jordan during and after this crisis in the gulf -- 
hosting the conference is very hard for us to understand." 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, congressional support for the Administration's 
Persian Gulf policy showed signs of erosion. Members of the House Foreign 
Affairs subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East accused the Administration 
of sending Iraqi President Saddam Hussein confused signals that could have 
persuaded him that the United States would not oppose an invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee Chairman Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) bluntly told John H. Kelly, 
assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, that he may have 
inadvertently given Iraq a green light, recalling that he asked Kelly during a 
subcommittee hearing July 31 if the United States would come to Kuwait's 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Your response was, we have no defense treaty relationship with Kuwait," 
Hamilton said. "That leaves the impression with me, did leave the impression 
with me, that if Kuwait was attacked we would not respond."

"Obviously . . . the impression that was left with our chairman was the same 
impression that was left with Saddam Hussein," added California Rep. Tom Lantos 
(D-San Mateo). "This obsequious treatment of him by a large variety of 
high-ranking officials encouraged him to take this action." 
</P>
<P>
When Hamilton asked if the current U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia 
extends the American defense umbrella to any other countries, Kelly said there 
are no written commitments. 
</P>
<P>
But Kelly later said the Administration is prepared to defend against possible 
Iraqi aggression all states in the gulf region that are complying with the U.N. 
embargo against Baghdad. He said the commitment does not extend to aggression 
by any other state. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the House subcommittee suggested that Washington's response to 
the crisis will damage the interests of Israel, long the closest American ally 
in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos, a staunch backer of Israel, charged that an Administration proposal to 
sell as much as $22 billion in weapons to Saudi Arabia will "simply erase" 
Israel's qualitative technological "edge" in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Lawrence J. (Larry) Smith (D-Fla.) accused the Administration of 
"snubbing" Israel because Secretary of State James A. Baker III did not visit 
Jerusalem during a trip to the region last week. Referring to Baker's meetings 
in Syria, Smith said the United States is "jumping into bed with someone we 
wouldn't have danced with" previously. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, Tutwiler was remarkably sympathetic to Jordan's 
continued use of Iraqi oil, presumably shipped by land across the long border 
between Jordan and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
She said Jordan is trying to abide by the United Nations trade embargo of Iraq 
but cannot do so completely because the Hashemite kingdom is economically 
dependent on its richer and more powerful neighbor. She also said that Jordan 
might tighten its compliance with the embargo if other nations replace some of 
the revenue it would lose by doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan now gets about 40% of its oil from Iraq, down from more than 90% before 
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
"Jordan has a very, very difficult situation here . . . and we are all working 
to alleviate their unique and specific (economic) pain . . . and to help them 
abide by these sanctions," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has been ambivalent in its approach to Jordan ever since the 
crisis began, criticizing King Hussein for his support of Iraq while avoiding 
an open break with one of Washington's oldest friends in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jordan represents one of the most serious leaks in the trade embargo, 
U.S. officials are reluctant to be too harsh in their criticism. Jordan-Iraq 
trade represents a relatively insignificant part of the overall Iraqi economy, 
although it is vitally important to Jordan. For instance, the 40% of Jordan's 
oil that comes from Iraq amounts to about 27,000 barrels a day, only 1% of 
Iraq's pre-crisis exports, the State Department said. It is not clear how 
Jordan is paying for the Iraqi oil that it receives. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said it has no evidence that Jordan is shipping any of the 
Iraqi oil elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tutwiler said that two more U.S.-chartered airliners are scheduled 
to evacuate American citizens from Kuwait this week. One flight leaves today 
and the other Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Even before those flights, the numbers of Americans trapped in Kuwait and Iraq 
had shrunk to fewer than 1,500, or less than half the number who were there at 
the start of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said that about 1,269 Americans are still in Kuwait and 170 in Iraq. 
About 82 Americans have been seized by the Iraqi government for use as "human 
shields" at potential military targets. Tutwiler stressed that the numbers, 
although quite specific, are only estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"Our focus on the ground in Iraq and Kuwait remains evacuating American 
citizens as expeditiously as possible," Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations, a Soviet official said the five permanent members of the 
Security Council have completed a draft document that would impose an air 
embargo against Iraq. The official said the draft is being dispatched to the 
five respective nations for review. 
</P>
<P>
"The draft deals only with the cutoff of all commercial air traffic to Iraq and 
Kuwait," the official said, noting that it excludes proposals to freeze Iraqi 
assets abroad and other actions reportedly discussed by the Soviet, U.S., 
British, French and Chinese ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat close to the negotiations cautioned that the 10 other 
members of the Security Council are far from agreement on an expanded blockade 
to halt the shipment of goods by commercial aircraft. 
</P>

Staff writer Don Shannon, at the United Nations, contributed to this report.

AIR FORCE'S 2ND CHOICE NOT AS VOCAL 
</P>

<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's preferred candidate for Air Force chief of 
staff, Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, was a finalist when the post became available 
earlier this summer but lost out in part because Gen. Michael J. Dugan was 
judged better able to "tell the Air Force story," a senior Air Force officer 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Given Dugan's firing Monday for indiscretions in an interview with The Times 
and the Washington Post, it would seem that the less loquacious McPeak is the 
right man at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
With discretion and tact now the watchwords, associates of McPeak who were 
contacted for remarks about the man and his record refused public comment. 
Still, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said, subordinates should not fear 
talking with reporters -- a point he said he had made to commanders and other 
Pentagon officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a thorough misreading and a total misunderstanding if anyone were 
to conclude that we're trying to discourage people from talking to the press," 
Williams said. "We encourage our military commanders to be open and 
accessible." 
</P>
<P>
Air Force leaders may be betting that the 54-year-old McPeak's career record 
will speak for itself. In his 33 years with the Air Force, McPeak has received 
16 medals and awards, including the Distinguished Service Medal for 
exceptionally meritorious service and the Silver Star for gallantry in combat. 
</P>
<P>
A Vietnam veteran and former Thunderbird pilot, McPeak's present responsibility 
as commander in chief of the Pacific Air Forces at Hickam Air Force Base in 
Hawaii includes the command of more than 60,000 people serving in U.S. air 
operations from Japan to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
McPeak, who has more than 5,000 flying hours, was the lead flier for the 
Thunderbirds, or U.S. Air Force Demonstration Squadron, in more than 200 air 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
After his stunt flying, McPeak reported to Vietnam, where he flew 269 combat 
missions and earned several medals for gallantry and service during his nine 
months there. He then received his master's degree in international relations 
from George Washington University and attended the National War College in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
He was assigned to command U.S. air bases in England and Spain for one year 
each and was eventually promoted to chief of staff of U.S. air forces in Europe 
in 1981. Returning to the United States in 1982, McPeak served at Langley Air 
Force Base in Virginia, at Air Force headquarters in Washington and as 
commander of the 12th Air Force at Bergstrom Air Force Base in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
His promotions came quickly after 1981, when he rose to brigadier general. In 
July, 1988, he was promoted to full general. 
</P>
<P>
A health and fitness buff, McPeak is married and has two sons. 
</P>
<P>
Williams declined to say how soon President Bush is expected to act on Cheney's 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
As for Dugan, he will receive a full pension, which for an officer with his 
rank and seniority totals about $60,000 annually, officials said.

<P>
Exiled writer Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn, given a public platform by the Soviet 
press, called Tuesday for establishment of an all-Slav state to replace the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In a 16,000-word article entitled "How to Revitalize Russia," Solzhenitsyn 
launched a scathing attack on 70 years of Communist rule in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"The time of communism is over," the exiled Nobel laureate wrote. "But its 
concrete structure hasn't collapsed yet. And let us not find ourselves under 
its rubble instead of becoming free." 
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn, 71, wrote the article at his home in Cavendish, Vt. It was 
published in a special supplement to the reformist newspaper Komsomolskaya 
Pravda and took up the equivalent of four full pages. 
</P>
<P>
Komsomolskaya Pravda's circulation is 22 million. The article also will be 
published in this week's Literaturnaya Gazeta, a literary journal with a 
circulation of 4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The publication of Solzhenitsyn's hopes for his homeland represented another 
step in his official re-emergence in the Soviet Union. His long-banned books 
are being published in the nation that expelled him in 1974 for treason 
following the publication in the West of "Gulag Archipelago," his epic work 
about life in Stalin's labor camps. Last month, Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev ordered his citizenship restored. 
</P>
<P>
Although the article was lengthy, it was not the first time that the Soviet 
press has published Solzhenitsyn's views. 
</P>
<P>
In his essay, which was written in July, Solzhenitsyn sneered at Gorbachev's 
policy of revitalized socialism, saying: "What has five, six years, of 
perestroika (Gorbachev's program of reform) brought us except pitiful internal 
changes to the Central Committee, the building of an artificial electoral 
system to ensure the Communist Party does not lose power?" 
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn implicitly compared the Communist Party to prewar Germany's Nazi 
Party and said the leaders of the "Marxist-Leninist utopia" ought to be judged, 
just as the Nazis were at Nuremberg. The KGB secret police, with its "evil 
70-year history," should be dismantled, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"And what of the glorious driving forces of glasnost (openness) and 
perestroika?" he wrote, referring to Gorbachev and his generation of party 
leaders. "In their collection of these fashionable words, where is the word 
'purification' or 'catharsis'? All the dirty mouths which for decades served 
totalitarianism have rushed into the new glasnost. Out of every four 
mouthpieces of today's glasnost, three are former servants of Brezhnevism. Who 
among them has said at least one word of repentance instead of denouncing and 
damning the (Leonid I. Brezhnev) period?" 
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970, called for the 
establishment of a Russian Union formed from the three Slavic republics of 
Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine plus a large part of Kazakhstan. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gorbachev speaking to the Lithuanians, Solzhenitsyn said the process of 
secession needs to be slow: "It shouldn't resemble the way the Portuguese ran 
from Angola, leaving behind a mess and many years of civil war." Solzhenitsyn 
disavowed the need for an empire, either Soviet or Russian. Japan, he wrote, 
rid itself of its imperial ambitions and thrived. "We must choose," he wrote, 
"between the empire which kills us and the spiritual and material salvation of 
our nation."

INDEPENDENCE OF SOVIET UNIONS CALLED CRUCIAL; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: NEW FEDERATION SEEKS TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS WORKERS IN A 
MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMY.

<P>
Worried about protecting the rights of labor as the Soviet Union uses market 
forces to transform its economy, delegates representing 55 million workers met 
Tuesday to establish an independent trade union system. 
</P>
<P>
"There is great uncertainty about the future," Igor Y. Klochkov, chairman of 
the new Federation of Independent Trade Unions of the Russian Republic, told 
the opening of its second organizational congress. "Only an independent trade 
union can represent the interests of workers." 
</P>
<P>
Although he is a top official of the present Soviet labor union hierarchy, 
Klochkov harshly criticized the country's existing unions as incapable of 
representing worker interests. They have been used for too long by the ruling 
Communist Party to carry out its policies, he said, and, consequently, are not 
up to the challenge of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
Klochkov praised the program of radical economic reforms now under debate by 
the Supreme Soviet, the country's Legislature, as "an effective instrument to 
cure our sick economy." 
</P>
<P>
But he demanded that the government negotiate with his federation about a 
welfare structure to prevent the exploitation of workers under the new economic 
system. Ivan S. Silayev, premier of the Russian Republic, last week held a 
four-hour meeting with the new-style union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the eve of very deep changes that will touch all parts of our 
society," Klochkov said. 
</P>
<P>
The federation's main role, organizers said, will be to battle with the 
government to set a minimum wage, a 40-hour workweek, higher pensions, 
unemployment compensation and other social welfare programs to create a safety 
net in the country's new economic system. 
</P>
<P>
"As we move toward a market system, our No. 1 priority is to protect wage 
earners," said Yevgeni V. Arapov, one of the federation's leaders. "We are in 
favor of a market system with strict guarantees for decent living standards for 
those who are not rich." 
</P>
<P>
Delegates first met in March to try to establish the new federation, with the 
goal of replacing the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, which for 
nearly seven decades dictated the will of the Communist Party leadership to 
local trade unions. However, political differences kept the delegates from 
working out a program in March. 
</P>
<P>
Coal miners, who organized the biggest strikes in Soviet history 14 months ago, 
are still boycotting the congress. 
</P>
<P>
The miners say the new union resembles too closely the old council, although 
it, unlike the council, agrees that strikes can be used to fight for workers' 
rights and is setting up a strike-support fund. Many of the federation's 
leaders held posts in the old council, and some still do; Klochkov is a deputy 
chairman of the old organization. 
</P>
<P>
"The old leaders of the trade union apparatus cannot 'restructure' themselves 
and start representing the workers at last," Vladimir A. Filenko, a member of 
the miners' strike committee in the Arctic coal fields of Vorkuta, said in a 
telephone interview. "We do not believe this kind of restructuring is humanly 
possible. So, we are going to create our own truly independent union." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the new federation, however, defended their ability to turn their 
backs on the old-style union leadership, which was more concerned with 
maintaining production quotas than with getting better wages for workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we can change, just as the Soviet people will have to change," 
Arapov said. "The people who lived for 70 years under socialism will now have 
to learn to live in a capitalist society. We aren't getting new people from 
some other planet. The country can't find all new leaders, either." 
</P>
<P>
Arapov is the head of public relations and human services for the new 
federation -- the same post he held at the council. 
</P>
<P>
Although organizers of the miners' labor movement criticized the federation, 
they conceded that it is a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good that there's at least an alternative to the old trade union 
organization, which never represented the workers' needs," Filenko said. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri A. Bolderev, a leader of the miners' strike committee in the Donetsk 
region of the Ukraine, said the new union federation adds yet another player to 
the power game in the Soviet Union, which was formerly dominated by one player, 
the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Now there are many players," Bolderev said. "The game has become more 
complicated, and that's good." 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Y. Akritov, the federation's press spokesman and not a party member, 
said the new trade union council is a great change. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone who did not belong to the Communist Party could never have held a 
responsible post in union leadership," he said. "The fact that I head the press 
section indicates a huge change." 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the two organizations, he said, can be compared to a 
pyramid that used to be upside down, teetering on its tip, but has been 
righted. The top leadership in the council made all the rules and passed them 
on to local trade unions. Now, workers and local unions will direct the 
federation's leadership to fulfill their demands. 
</P>
<P>
"The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions was never anything more than a 
puppet of the Communist Party," Akritov said. "The federation is an umbrella 
that will protect us from returning to the command system." 
</P>
<P>
A flyer advertising the new federation shows it cutting the puppet strings that 
the Communist Party used to control the labor unions.

REJECT SOUTER, BACKERS OF ABORTION RIGHTS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
SUPREME COURT: BEING OPEN-MINDED ON THE ISSUE IS NOT ENOUGH, THEY SAY. BUT 
OTHERS DEFEND THE NOMINEE AS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF CIVIL LIBERTIES.

<P>
Abortion rights advocates urged the Senate on Tuesday to reject Supreme Court 
nominee David H. Souter, arguing that it is not enough for a judge to be 
open-minded about protecting fundamental constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not want to see him be open-minded about whether I have a right to 
free speech or whether I have a right to assemble in this room," Faye 
Wattleton, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation, told the Senate 
Judiciary Committee. She said she is equally unwilling to accept a mere 
open-minded stance regarding her right to choose an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Picking up the same theme, Kate Michelman, director of the National Abortion 
Rights Action League, said a Supreme Court nominee who is open-minded about the 
Brown vs. Board of Education ruling ending segregation would surely be 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony from the two abortion rights leaders highlighted a day in which 
the committee heard Souter praised as a "strong supporter of civil liberties" 
and denounced as a "total disaster for civil rights and women's rights." 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights groups, including the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and 
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said Souter was 
hostile or indifferent to civil rights and should be rejected. But several 
prominent attorneys, including former U.S. Atty. Gen. Griffin B. Bell and 
former Virginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, said they know Souter to be smart, 
sensitive and fair. 
</P>
<P>
The committee expects to wrap up its hearings today. A vote on the nomination 
will probably come during the committee's next regular meeting Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, as in the earlier hearings, the abortion issue drew the most 
attention and debate. 
</P>
<P>
During his testimony, Souter said he believes that the Constitution gives 
married couples a "fundamental right of privacy" in matters involving 
childbearing, but he refused to say whether he believes that this right remains 
after a woman becomes pregnant. "I have not made up my mind" on the abortion 
issue, he told the senators. 
</P>
<P>
The two abortion rights leaders said they found this statement "enormously 
disturbing" and adequate cause for rejecting his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we are on the brink of the court taking away a fundamental 
right," Michelman said. 
</P>
<P>
But their insistence that Souter support Roe vs. Wade was quickly rebuked by 
most of the committee members. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe you are making a big mistake on this," said Sen. Alan K. 
Simpson (R-Wyo.), who said that he favors abortion rights but that abortion 
should not be the only issue for considering a Supreme Court nominee. 
</P>
<P>
It is "totally unrealistic," Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) said, to expect that 
President Bush's nominee would flatly promise to uphold the right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Democrats, Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona said many Americans do 
not favor an unlimited right to abortion. Nor is the Roe vs. Wade ruling a 
"settled matter" in the same category as the Brown vs. Board of Education 
ruling that ended legal segregation in the schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't get Souter, who else are you going to get?" DeConcini asked. "I 
don't think he would sit there and lie to us, if his mind was made up" on 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The major anti-abortion groups, such as the National Right to Life Committee, 
did not testify at the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, only committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and Sen. 
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) sounded as if they agreed with Souter's critics. 
Several of Souter's longtime friends and fellow attorneys endorsed him with 
unabashed enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
Former Vermont Atty. Gen. Jerry Diamond, a Democrat, said he had a "drink and a 
cigar on occasion" with Souter and always found him thoughtful and fair-minded. 
"I believe there could be no fairer person to sit on the Supreme Court and 
protect the civil rights of all Americans," Diamond told the committee.

2 POLITICAL OUTSIDERS WIN IN MASSACHUSETTS PRIMARY

In a powerful rejection of the state's political Establishment, Massachusetts 
voters Tuesday chose two outsiders, Democrat John R. Silber, and Republican 
William F. Weld to run for governor in November. 
</P>
<P>
With 75% of the precincts counted, Silber, president of Boston University, had 
53% of the vote, against 44% for former state Atty. Gen. Francis X. Bellotti. 
Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, who withdrew from the race earlier, scored 3% of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
In the Republican race, with 73% of precincts counted, Weld, a former U.S. 
attorney, claimed 60% of the votes to state legislator Steven Pierce's 40%. 
</P>
<P>
"What you are really seeing tonight is the expression of anger of the people of 
the state of Massachusetts, said Avi Nelson, a conservative political analyst 
and former radio talk show host. "Everybody who was associated with the 
Establishment has gotten clobbered." 
</P>
<P>
In a jubilant acceptance speech, Weld, 43, said: "We're rolling now! 
Massachusetts voters are sick of the politics of the past. This year we can 
take government back." 
</P>
<P>
Silber's surprise victory was soon labeled "the ultimate Silber shocker," a 
reference to the former philosophy professor's habit of uttering bold and often 
provocative statements. 
</P>
<P>
In accepting the Democratic nomination, Silber promised: "I'll be able to help 
restore political integrity and help restore effective government." 
</P>
<P>
The primary was marked by an unusually high level of anger among voters, who 
blame incumbent officials in general -- and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in 
particular -- for the state's economic decline. Dukakis was not a candidate for 
reelection, but nearly everyone seemed to be running against him. 
</P>
<P>
State unemployment hit 6.7% in August, twice what it was just a year earlier. 
In July, Dukakis signed a $13.4-billion state budget. The same month, the 
Legislature passed the largest tax increase in the state's history and enacted 
a 4% across-the-board cut in the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that this is a voter rebellion by anyone's definition of 
the term," former Democratic U.S. Sen. Paul E. Tsongas said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bellotti, 67, has served as lieutenant governor and as state attorney general. 
Strongly opposed to abortion for many years, he shifted his position when he 
began his gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Bellotti was defeated in two earlier campaigns for the governorship, once in 
1964 and again in 1970. He was seen as the "old shoe" candidate, a true veteran 
of Massachusetts state politics. His support came largely from urban, ethnic, 
working-class Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Just weeks before the election, Silber began to gain on Bellotti in public 
opinion surveys. Silber, 63, had proudly portrayed himself as "a maverick -- 
that's an unbranded cow," and had resolutely portrayed himself as the candidate 
of change. 
</P>
<P>
Silber's campaign was noted for his blunt, acerbic manner and his controversial 
statements. During the final televised debate between the two Democrats, he was 
asked why he had made so few campaign appearances in Boston's predominantly 
black neighborhoods. "There is no point in my making a speech on crime control 
to a group of drug addicts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bellotti, Silber supports abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Weld, also an abortion-rights backer, appealed to moderate Republicans and 
independents in his campaign. Weld was an assistant attorney general in the 
Ronald Reagan Administration but resigned in protest over what he saw as 
ethical questions surrounding his boss, former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III. 
</P>
<P>
Weld's personal fortune and patrician heritage were the targets of bitter 
attacks by Pierce, minority leader of the state's House of Representatives. 
Described as fiercely anti-abortion, Pierce was equally rabid on the subject of 
lowering taxes. Pierce lashed hard against Dukakis throughout the campaign, 
holding the Democratic governor personally responsible for the state's economic 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce appealed strongly to the most conservative state Republicans, who make 
up only 13.4% of registered Republicans in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Former GOP Gov. Frank Sargent was asked if the strong vote predicted for Weld 
by various exit polls Tuesday would help the GOP in Massachusetts in the long 
run. "I wish I could say the Republicans would benefit. But I think it was the 
anger this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Oklahoma, voters approved a first-in-the-nation constitutional 
amendment limiting legislators to no more than 12 years in office. Runoff 
elections for Oklahoma governor went down to the wire in both parties: Democrat 
David Walters and Republican Bill Price each won by margins of 51% to 49%.

Tap dancer Steve Condos collapsed and died in his dressing room after a 
grueling performance Sunday night at the biennial Festival of Dance in Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Lyon coroner's institute said the cause of death appeared to be 
a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave an absolutely brilliant performance," his wife, Lorraine Condos, told 
the Associated Press. "I was out front filming it. He walked off stage, went 
into his dressing room and collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
Condos, 71, a figure on the American stage for 50 years, had been in 
semi-retirement for years. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran dancer, best known for his appearances with his late brother Nick 
as the Condos Brothers, won a huge ovation when the festival opened Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Condos was a central figure in the production, "Stars and Taps," in which he 
performed a long, fast tap that left him breathless. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Philadelphia, Condos had recently lived in Hollywood, Fla., 
performing only occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of a small, elite cadre of veteran tap dancers who had ridden a wave 
of enthusiasm for tap in recent years to new popularity and esteem. He was 
among the hoofers in the 1989 movie "Tap," which starred Gregory Hines and 
Sammy Davis Jr. Condos played a dancer called "Steve." 
</P>
<P>
He also was featured in Hollywood musicals from the major studios alongside 
such stars as Betty Grable and danced in a number of Broadway musicals. He 
toured the United States and Europe with the Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Tommy 
Dorsey and Duke Ellington orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
A strapping, square-jawed bear of a man, Condos was one of the few white stars 
in an art form usually dominated by blacks.

Edwin Allan Lightner Jr., 82, a 40-year U.S. diplomat who saw the Berlin Wall 
erected and took part in a Cold War prisoner exchange with the Soviet Union, 
died here on Saturday of congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
Lightner joined the Foreign Service in 1930 and served in 18 countries before 
retiring in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Lightner was assistant chief of the U.S. Mission in Berlin when the wall was 
erected in 1961. He was twice detained by East German border guards in October, 
1961, when he crossed into East Berlin to underscore the United States' 
determination to have unrestricted access to all occupation zones in Berlin.

<P>
Lightner also participated in the Berlin exchange of Francis Gary Powers, the 
American U-2 pilot shot down during a reconnaissance flight over the Soviet

HUBBARD REQUESTS OWNERSHIP RULING; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: HE APPARENTLY WANTS TO KNOW IF HOLLYWOOD PARK ROLE COULD BE 
CONSIDERED A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
R.D. Hubbard, apparently continuing his battle to oust Marje Everett and assume 
operating control of Hollywood Park, has asked the California Horse Racing 
Board for an opinion about whether he has a conflict of interest because of 
holdings in other California race tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard, whose purchases this year have given him 9.9% of the stock in 
Hollywood Park, also is one of the owners of Los Alamitos Race Course and owns 
less than 1% of the stock in Santa Anita. The structure of Hollywood Park stock 
is such that no one can have more than 9.9% of the total. Everett has control 
of 11%, but a portion of it is in a trust and can not be used for voting. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Hutcheson, executive secretary of the racing board, could not be reached 
for comment on the opinion sought by Hubbard, who apparently anticipated that 
his ownership in other tracks could be interpreted as a potential conflict. 
Hubbard's office in Ft. Worth, said that he was out of the country and could 
not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the racing board is on Sept. 28, but since Hubbard's 
request is not on the agenda, it is unlikely that the board will consider his 
situation then. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who has run Hollywood Park since 1972, has told her opponents that she 
will not step aside. Her regime has been subjected to considerable criticism in 
recent years as the track's debt reached $100 million. Payment of dividends 
resumed recently after a three-year absence. By selling Los Alamitos, Hollywood 
Park has eliminated more than half of that debt. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Gamel, a member of the Hollywood Park board, is another shareholder who has 
tried to oust Everett. Gamel nominated Hubbard to the board in June, but no 
action has been taken by the nominating committee, which consists of Everett 
and two of her allies, Merv Griffin and John Forsythe. Apparently the 11-member 
board will meet with Hubbard before considering his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard, who also owns Ruidoso Downs in New Mexico and the Woodlands, a 
thoroughbred-greyhound racing facility in Kansas City, Kan., would like to oust 
Everett at the board level, and in a recent letter to the track's board he 
proposed making her chairman emeritus by the end of the year. Another way to 
create a change is through a proxy fight, which would cost the track's 
shareholders and Hubbard's group millions of dollars in legal fees. Some 
investors say the fight could cost each side as much as $2 million. The 
advantage Everett would have in such a struggle is that she could wage her side 
of the battle with track money. 
</P>
<P>
In the event of a proxy fight, Hubbard reportedly has begun to line up 
constituents and may have owners of as much as 30% of the stock on his side. A 
key player in the struggle is Harry Ornest, a Beverly Hills resident who owns 
the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. Ornest owns 9.9% of the 
track's stock, but he has been noncommittal about which way he would go in the 
event of a proxy battle. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park's second-quarter report was much improved over last year, 
primarily because the restructuring of its bank loan greatly reduced interest 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
The track's net cash flow for the period was $6.4 million, compared to $3.3 
million for the second quarter in 1989. Hollywood's debt service was reduced by 
$2.7 million for the quarter, to $1.1 million, which means that the track's 
cash flow for the period increased by about $400,000.

BASEBALL: BRAVES' CRIES, DODGERS' WHISPERS HELP DANIELS SCORE AS LOS ANGELES 
PULLS WITHIN 4 1/2 GAMES OF THE REDS AGAIN, 6-2.

Amid Eddie Murray's sudden challenge for the batting championship, and after 
another loud fall by the Cincinnati Reds, the Dodgers cinched a 6-2 victory 
over the Atlanta Braves Tuesday with the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
A whisper. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth inning, with the Dodgers leading, 3-0, Kal Daniels reached third 
base after the Braves had botched a potential inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Blauser, the Braves' shortstop who had applied a late tag on Murray at 
second base, was holding the ball with his back to home plate as he fretted 
over the umpire's call. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Amalfitano, the Dodgers' third base coach, quietly stepped toward Daniels, 
leaned over and whispered. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Move up the line, move up the line,' " Amalfitano said. "I know 
the third baseman couldn't hear us, and I hoped nobody else heard us." 
</P>
<P>
With only 3,891 at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium, nobody did. Daniels creeped 
toward home plate until, suddenly, he broke into a sprint. Frantic teammates 
screamed at Blauser, who spun toward home plate, but it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels crossed the plate before Blauser's hurried throw, scoring the first of 
three Dodger runs in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers moved within 4 1/2 games of the first-place Reds for the second 
time in four days. 
</P>
<P>
"Those kind of plays make your day," said Amalfitano, who this season has also 
helped engineer the Dodgers' first two steals of home since 1984. "I think 
we've been getting runs like that more this year than in recent years, because 
of the manager's aggressiveness and because we have the guys to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Said Daniels: "That was great. We (play) a team that has nothing to play for, 
they become lackadaisical, not into the game, and we sneak one on them. That 
was really fun." 
</P>
<P>
He paused, and shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've still got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Behind rookie Jim Neidlinger's fifth consecutive victory in eight starts, the 
Dodgers picked up a game for the third time in five days when the Reds lost to 
the San Francisco Giants, 5-3. But to tie the Reds, the Dodgers still must win 
12 of their remaining 14 games if the Reds go 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
When the Dodgers return home tonight for the opener of a two-game series 
against the San Diego Padres at Dodger Stadium, fans will see more than merely 
the final remnants of a pennant race. They will also see the beginnings of 
Dodger involvement in a batting race that could result in the team's first 
batting championship in 27 years, since Tommy Davis hit .326 in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
By getting three more hits in five at-bats, Murray improved his average to 
.325, moving him ahead of the New York Mets' Dave Magadan (.324) and into third 
place in the National League batting race. He trails both Philadelphia's Lenny 
Dykstra (.331) and former St. Louis Cardinal Willie McGee (.335), although 
McGee is probably the only one who will matter. Because McGee was traded to the 
Oakland Athletics, his average will not change. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming he has four at-bats per game, Murray must bat .446 in the team's final 
14 games to tie McGee. But on this eight-game trip, Murray hit .520, with 13 
hits in 25 at-bats. In September, he is hitting .441, with 26 hits in 59 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he can do it," said Daniels, who entered this season as a career .302 
hitter. "He comes out and gets a couple of hits a game for the rest of the 
year. . . . Heck, he's doing that now. I've been telling him all year that I 
didn't think Dykstra was going to win it." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said he finally spoke to Murray about the batting race Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Hey, you're in the batting race!' " Daniels said. "He didn't say 
anything, so I said, 'Hey, did you hear me?' He still didn't say anything. I 
have never heard him say a word about the winning the title." 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who entered the season as a career .291 hitter, never has hit better 
than .316. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still a lot of games to be played, a lot of things can happen," 
Murray said. "I never think about any of that stuff while there are still games 
to be played." 
</P>
<P>
Murray has had to contend with a sore wrist, which he packs in ice after games. 
Murray missed a game because of the soreness last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been hurting for a while," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
With the recent slump by Hubie Brooks, who has four hits in his last 32 at-bats 
while batting behind Murray, the first baseman also has five walks in his last 
15 plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to deal with walks all season, they come for different reasons, so I 
wouldn't make too much of them," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels' two-run double in the first inning helped him end his season 
against the Braves with 10 hits in 21 at-bats at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium 
for a .476 average with a homer and five RBIs. When asked if he wished he could 
play here, 90 minutes from his hometown of Warner Robins, Ga., Daniels said, "I 
plan on playing here one day, no doubt about it. Every kid has a dream to play 
near his hometown." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson was benched for a fifth consecutive game, and for the first time 
against a right-handed pitcher, Paul Marak. Gibson's replacement, Stan Javier, 
batted .370 on this trip and helped the Dodgers to four victories in his five 
starts. Gibson has one hit in his last 29 at-bats. . . . Jim Neidlinger gave up 
one run and four hits in seven innings to improve to 5-1 while lowering his 
earned-run average to 2.70. He walked none, struck out one, and worked fast. 
"That is my game -- go out there, pitch the ball, get it back and pitch again," 
he said. . . . Both of Marak's losses have come against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Harris, who had missed four starts because of left-handed pitching, hit 
Marak's first pitch into left field for a single and had three hits in five 
at-bats with a .308 average. Despite his platoon status, Harris is batting .459 
in his last nine starts. "I take my batting practice, I stay sharp, I stay 
ready," Harris said. "I've always been a second-half player, and I'm just glad 
I get a chance to prove it." . . . Pat Perry warmed up in the bullpen for a 
second consecutive game even though he had no hope of pitching. "I'm just 
trying to stay in shape," said Perry, who has not pitched since coming off the 
disabled list Sept. 1. Perry said that the problem with his routine is that as 
soon as he begins warming up, the regular bullpen members often have to warm 
up, forcing his removal from the bullpen mound.

OLYMPIC BID: BUT THE CELEBRATING WILL FADE INTO YEARS OF HARD WORK -- AND AN 
EXPENDITURE OF ABOUT $1 BILLION.

<P>
Olympic fever, which was building in Georgia for months, burst into full flame 
Tuesday, catching the city up in a celebration that might last for years. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks, balloons, hugs, kisses, shouts, toasts, laughter and tears of joy 
lit up the early morning, as thousands of citizens gathered at a downtown plaza 
in the entertainment complex called Underground Atlanta to watch the 
announcement beamed to the city by satellite television from Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the Games! We want the Games!" the crowd at Underground chanted before 
the decision was announced. 
</P>
<P>
"We won the Games! We won the Games!" it shouted after. 
</P>
<P>
Men in pin-striped suits and women in power dresses mingled with college 
students in shorts and T-shirts -- all united in the thrill of victory. Drivers 
honked horns, pedestrians waved and flashed victory signs throughout the day 
and vowed to party into the night. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the culmination of a lifetime," said Anne Hebert, tears welling in her 
eyes. "I was born and raised here. I've never seen Atlanta like this before in 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
In joining Los Angeles and St. Louis as the only U.S. cities to be awarded the 
Summer Olympics, Atlanta astounded nonbelievers and made the odds-makers look 
odd. 
</P>
<P>
The city wrestled the Games away from the sentimental favorite -- Athens, 
Greece -- and now is counting on a bonanza of jobs and money. Officials are 
predicting that the Games will pump up the state's economy with more than 
80,000 jobs and $3.5 billion over a six-year period. The construction industry 
is expected to benefit immensely from a building boom, and foreign investment 
is expected to pick up sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, an immense investment awaits as well. Sports facilities and housing 
must be built for for the expected 16,500 athletes who will compete in the 
16-day Games. Officials of the Atlanta Organizing Committee said new facilities 
will include those for tennis, cycling, shooting, equestrian events, archery, 
canoeing and rowing. 
</P>
<P>
The total building cost is expected to be $418.4 million, including a $145.2 
million Olympic Stadium to be built next to the Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. 
Operating expenses for the Games are projected at $587 million, bringing the 
total cost of the Games to more than $1 billion. Thus, cynics around town 
describe the Games as "the billion-dollar gamble." 
</P>
<P>
As the celebration wound down Tuesday, a policeman near Underground Atlanta 
grumbled to a reporter, "I can't understand how people could be so happy when 
they just incurred a billion-dollar debt." 
</P>
<P>
Olympic boosters see the situation differently. 
</P>
<P>
"Atlanta now goes into another orbit, and that orbit is global," Atlanta Mayor 
Maynard Jackson said from Tokyo. "It's international, it's irreversible. We're 
on a different map, now." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, who was attending a political luncheon in Denver, said, "Today, 
there's another city that's feeling a mile high, and that's Atlanta." He 
congratulated the city, and said it was "going to host a terrific Olympics. And 
I'm proud the Olympic Games will be back in the United States," after the 1992 
Games in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Atlantans celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we'd get it!" shouted Pearletta Graves, a recruiter for Blue Chip 
Services, a temporary employment agency, as she waved a green balloon. "I knew 
we'd get it! I hurt my throat screaming. This is so exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Bennett, director of administration at a law firm, listened to the 
decision on radio as he drove in to work. At a stoplight, he reported, 
"Everybody's hands went up" in exultation, "and horns started honking." 
</P>
<P>
Others reported that drivers jumped out of cars to deliver high fives and do 
victory dances. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the decision was announced, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution hit 
the streets with a special edition, a banner headline, proclaiming: "It's 
Atlanta!" 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there were times during its almost four-year quest that even the 
faithful wondered whether Atlanta could do it. 
</P>
<P>
As Michael Lomax, chairman of the Fulton County Commission, put it: "Everybody 
was sleeping on the floor so they wouldn't fall out of bed on this one." 
</P>
<P>
Across the state, in Savannah, where yachting events will be held, supporters 
of the effort popped champagne corks in victory, reported John Hicks, vice 
president for business development at the chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks likened the wait for the announcement to the agonizing moment when a 
diver "stands on the high-dive board and curls his toes around it, realizing 
how high he is." The news, he said, brought "a tremendous sigh of relief." 
</P>
<P>
At the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, Juliet Blackburn-Beamon, a 
marketing manager, called the Olympics "a shot in the arm" for the agency 
because it will gain passengers as curious visitors pour into Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Rosensweig, international finance professor at Emory University's 
business school, agreed, predicting that Atlanta "is going to seem like a 
beacon, a place of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe the Olympics are coming just in time to keep Atlanta 
vital, economically. Calling the state's economy "dead in the water," 
Rosensweig said, "We needed some engine of growth, and I didn't see any others 
on the horizon." 
</P>
<P>
Hopeful Georgians from every economic level are counting on the spending. 
</P>
<P>
In a park where the down and out hang out, Marion Thomas, 61, unemployed, 
agreed, saying, "When it gets here, there's going to be plenty of money. I 
figure on getting me some peanuts to sell." 
</P>
<P>
Already, there has been an outpouring of money. Khalil Johnson, manager of the 
Georgia Dome, a 70,500-seat facility scheduled to open in 1992, two years 
before Atlanta holds the 1994 Super Bowl, said that the announcement spurred 
interest in the luxury box suites that cost up to $120,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy called and said he wanted a suite," Johnson said. "We said, 'You'd 
better get over here quick. He was here in 20 minutes with an $80,000 check."

GWYNN SAYS HE GETS THE PICTURE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THE OUTFIELDER'S SEASON IS OVER BECAUSE OF A FINGER INJURY, AND HIS 
PADRE CAREER MIGHT BE OVER TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gruesome photograph, symbolizing not only hatred and violence, but perhaps 
racism as well, hangs prominently in the locker of Padre right fielder Tony 
Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
His family can't understand why he keeps it. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Gwynn who asked a photographer for the picture. It is Gwynn who has 
displayed and is mesmerized by it. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever he enters the clubhouse, he stares at it, reminding himself of what a 
horrifying year it has been for him. 
</P>
<P>
The incident that produced the photo occurred 11 days ago, a week before a 
finger injury abruptly ended Gwynn's season last Saturday in Atlanta. But it 
was an incident that will remain in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn walked out to the Padre dugout, three hours before game time, and there, 
dangling by a coat hanger was a plastic figurine of Gwynn, the kind you find in 
toy stores. 
</P>
<P>
Someone had cut the arms and feet off the figurine and put a noose around its 
neck. Someone had committed a mock lynching. 
</P>
<P>
What made it so painful to Gwynn was his belief that it had been done by 
someone on the ballclub. He saw it as a thinly veiled threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone is out to get me, that's for damn sure," Gwynn said. "This is the 
worst year of my life. The only thing that's missing out of this year is death 
threats, and I'm sure that'll come next. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm not quitting, and if they want to say anything to my face, they know 
where they can find me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm right here. Come and get me." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn's eyes began to mist as he talked. 
</P>
<P>
Said his wife, Alicia: "They've done everything they could to that man. They've 
hurt him. They've tried to ruin him. They've tried to make him quit. 
</P>
<P>
"What they've done, I feel, is let him know that he doesn't have a true friend 
on the team." 
</P>
<P>
That is why, she says, that Gwynn's crashing into the outfield wall Saturday 
night in Atlanta might have been the best thing that could have happened to 
him. He broke his right index finger and will have surgery today. 
</P>
<P>
His season is over. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel strongly that everything happens for a reason, and that's why the 
injury occurred," his wife said. "He needed a break. He needed a break from all 
this. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he wanted to go out and get 200 hits, and do this and that, but with 
everything that's gone on this season, he finally can get peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
It would seem he is due some, considering this season. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I never was looking to be treated any differently," Gwynn said. "I 
never believed all that stuff about me being Mr. Padre, Mr. Organization Guy. 
All I ever wanted was to be treated with the same respect as the other 24 guys. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought I got along with everybody. I've always tried to do my very 
best. I never thought any of my teammates would ever think of me this way. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's what hurts the most." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn believes he knows who hung the doll in the dugout. Several Padre players 
say they're pretty sure, too. But no one is willing to talk on the record. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn smiles. Why should anything change now? When Gwynn-bashing was the big 
craze in May, nobody stood up for him in a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
It was at that meeting, on May 24 in New York, that teammates became openly 
critical of Gwynn's playing style. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn was told, face to face, that he was a selfish player. First baseman Jack 
Clark berated him, saying that Gwynn cared only about himself, that he was 
fattening his batting average at the expense of others. Others criticized Gwynn 
for not being a team leader. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn answered the accusations. He bunts frequently not to protect his average 
but only because he has difficulty pulling the ball to the right side, he said. 
He is not elated after victories when he goes hitless because he knows he 
didn't do his job. He does not scream and lead cheers because that simply isn't 
his style. 
</P>
<P>
Then Gwynn sat down and waited for some backing. 
</P>
<P>
He is still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
No one spoke on his behalf. Not even his best buddies, Joe Carter and Bip 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I had a couple of guys that came up to my room that night and 
apologized, saying they were intimidated," Gwynn said. "And a few others came 
up to me in later weeks, saying they were sorry. 
</P>
<P>
"But, it just wasn't the same." 
</P>
<P>
Alicia Gwynn said: "You know, I love my husband dearly, but he accepts too 
much. In my opinion, a friend loveth at all times, not just when it's 
convenient. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have told them, 'Get out of my room. Get out of my room right now!' " 
</P>
<P>
The meeting left Gwynn devastated. He said he paced the floor of his hotel room 
for four consecutive nights. It took him three weeks just to begin looking some 
of his teammates in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
And, for the first time in his career, Gwynn actually was relishing the idea of 
being traded away from the team and city that he always called home. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking, 'If they're going to be saying all this stuff about me, maybe 
I shouldn't even be here,' " Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
It's almost funny, Gwynn said, looking back at spring training and thinking 
what a great year this would be. He thought the Padres were a lock to win the 
National League West title. He thought if he didn't win his fourth consecutive 
batting title, he'd surely be in the running for it. He thought that even if 
everything went wrong, it sure would be a fun playing with this bunch of guys. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, with two weeks left to play, the Padres are trying to hang onto fourth 
place, Gwynn has finished his season with a .309 batting average, his lowest 
since 1983, and no one can remember the last good time they had in the 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I think a lot of guys in here are happy that I didn't 
win the batting title," Gwynn said. "There are guys that wanted to see me go 
down with them. Yeah, that's what kind of year it's been." 
</P>
<P>
The cruel irony of it all is that Gwynn and his wife decided in the spring that 
they would wait until the final day of the season to move into their 
custom-designed home in Poway. Sure, it would have been nice to get the family 
settled before the start of school, but Gwynn wouldn't hear of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about it but I just didn't want the distractions," he said. "It's 
hard enough playing this game without having those things on your mind." 
</P>
<P>
Little did Gwynn, or anyone else, realize the season would be nothing but a 
distraction for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing what he's done with everything on his mind," said Chris Gwynn, 
Tony's brother who plays for the Dodgers. "He's so used to going out and 
playing for the love of the game, and having no distractions. 
</P>
<P>
"But with everything that's happened in that clubhouse, and the things that 
have been said about him, it's amazing he could play at all. The whole family 
is upset about what's going on, so you can imagine how it's affecting him. 
</P>
<P>
"But look what happened. He still hit .309. Tony might not like that, but come 
on, .309, a lot of guys would kill for that." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn refuses to use the distractions as an excuse, but in the same breath, 
says he has nothing to apologize for this season. He points out that he drove 
in 72 runs, the most of his career, and the second-highest total on the team. 
And until Saturday, he missed only one game because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
"If people have a problem with what I do then the hell with them," he said. "I 
know what I can do and what I can't do, and I'm not going to change my game. 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets right down to it, the only people I have to please are the people 
upstairs, and myself. And if I don't please the people upstairs, they'll get 
rid of me." 
</P>
<P>
In two years, the Padres may not have a choice. Gwynn is eligible for free 
agency after the 1992 season. And for the first time, he wonders if he'll be 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, he'll always continue to make San Diego his home, with his folks and 
Alicia's family living in Long Beach. His ultimate desire still is to play out 
his career with the Padres. But . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I told Tony, whatever he wants to do, we're behind him," Alicia said. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, 30, who earned $1 million this season, has a year left on his contract, 
at $2 million, and the Padres have until 10 days after the 1990 World Series to 
pick up an option for $2 million in 1991. He kicks himself every day, knowing 
if he hadn't signed a three-year extension in 1988, he would be eligible for 
free agency this year. 
</P>
<P>
But Gwynn has already voiced his complaints about his contract, saying it isn't 
right that he is the seventh-highest paid player on the team. That apparently 
turned many fans against him. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Werner, Padre chairman, said he will address Gwynn's contract in the 
off-season. He says he wants to make Gwynn happy and keep him in the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not just a great player, but an extraordinary person," Werner said. "It'd 
be crazy not to want a guy like that to be a part of your future." 
</P>
<P>
Time will tell if Gwynn wants the Padres to be part of his future.

Coach Dennis Erickson, who last week told his Miami Hurricanes to temper their 
talk, has now cracked down on showboating. At least two Hurricanes "crossed the 
line" of good taste by dancing, prancing and posing after big plays in 
Saturday's 52-24 victory at California, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't very proud of it, and I know our team wasn't very proud of it," he 
said. "There's a point where it's embarrassing to the program." Erickson said 
players guilty of excessive celebrating will be benched for the rest of the 
game and possibly longer. 
</P>
<P>
All-American cornerback Todd Lyght suffered reinjury of a pulled hamstring and 
might be sidelined for Saturday's game with No. 24 Michigan State, Notre Dame 
Coach Lou Holtz said.

THE BOTTOM TEN: OREGON STATE'S HAT TRICK IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
They said it couldn't be done. But Oregon State (0-3) managed to record 
consecutive losses to Montana, Kansas and Nevada Las Vegas to wrest the Bottom 
Ten lead from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
OSU settled the issue early against Vegas' gambling defense, fumbling the first 
six times it had the ball in a 20-45 loss. Leave it to the Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas, meanwhile, chalked up some bizarre stats of its own, missing all six 
of its conversion tries, while making three field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Alabumble (0-2) moved up to No. 2, while the Big Ten made its annual appearance 
at No. 4. It's sporting of the conference to have agreed to admit Penn State 
(0-2). Now, Northwestern (0-1) and Wisconsin (1-1) have someone to play with. 
</P>
<P>
ROUT OF THE WEEK: Rutgers (2-0) over Penn State (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
QUOTEBOOK (I): Cal State Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy, whose team lost at 
Mississippi State, 13-27, after arriving at midnight the day before the game: 
"We were outslept." 
</P>
<P>
QUOTEBOOK (II): Missouri Coach Bob Stull, whose team ended a five-game losing 
streak over two seasons with a 45-10 win over Utah State: "Some of the coaches 
even had trouble remembering the words to the fight song because we hadn't won 
in a while." 
</P>
<P>
QUOTEBOOK (III): Northwestern's Len Williams, who was listed as a fullback last 
year, reacted this way when told he'd be the team's starting QB this season: "I 
was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
This -- the fifth and final year of his contract -- is the season Beagles' 
brain Buddy Ryan promised he'd bring Philadelphia a title. While no team has 
ever started 0-2 and reached the Super Bowl, Ryan can take comfort in the fact 
that plenty have gone on to win the Bottom Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
He's no shoe-in for the BT trophy yet, but some critics are barking that the 
Beagles' open date in the fifth week would be a convenient time to ax Ryan. One 
talk-show caller coined the phrase, "Buddy by the bye." 
</P>
<P>
And, just think -- second-string QB Jim McMahon hasn't even begun mouthing off 
yet! Then the fun'll really begin! 
</P>
<P>
So much for the Jerry Glanville era in Atlanta. The coach forgot to leave 
tickets at the window for his offense and the Falcon Crest team waltzed to a 
14-21 loss to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
CRUMMY GAME OF THE WEEK: Indianapolis (0-2) at Houston (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
CONFIDENCE-BUILDER: Charger Coach Dan Henning, confirming that kicker Fuad 
Reveiz would be fired unless his accuracy improves Sunday: "It is a do or die 
week."

HARTSUYKER MAKES DEFINITION CLEAR; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: CONFUSED WITH MARINOVICH AND OBSCURED BY SEAU LAST SEASON, HE 
STAMPS IMAGE ON USC'S YOUNG DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's bad enough that Craig Hartsuyker, a senior outside linebacker at USC, is 
best known as the player who replaced Junior Seau, last season's defensive 
player of the year in the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
But Hartsuyker (HART-sigh-ker) also has been mistaken for Todd Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
Hartsuyker and the Trojan quarterback bear little resemblance, but both are 
redheads, which was enough last season to confuse fans seeking autographs and 
out-of-town reporters seeking postgame comments. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't happened this year, and I'm thankful for that," Hartsuyker said. 
"I'd rather be known as me than someone else." 
</P>
<P>
He has made headway. 
</P>
<P>
Hartsuyker was chosen as player of the game by USC officials last Saturday for 
his role in the Trojans' 19-14 victory over Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
Although he made only four tackles, three were for losses, one of those a sack 
of Penn State's Tony Sacca. 
</P>
<P>
And it was Hartsuyker and Kurt Barber, his opposite number on the strong side, 
who chased Sacca out of the pocket on fourth and goal from the one-yard line 
during a fourth-quarter goal-line stand by the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Barber knocked the ball from Sacca's hand, officials ruled the play an 
incomplete pass and the Penn State drive fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
Hartsuyker made similar plays in his first three seasons at USC, mostly without 
fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
"At USC, there are a lot of good players," said Chris Allen, who coaches the 
Trojans' outside linebackers and is also defensive coordinator. "To get 
recognition, you have to be something special. And he is something special." 
</P>
<P>
The problem was, after being selected by Football News to its sophomore 
All-American team two years ago, Hartsuyker lost his starting job last season 
to Seau, who was extra special. 
</P>
<P>
Seau forfeited his senior season to make himself available for the NFL draft 
and was the fifth player taken. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't as if Hartsuyker was relegated to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Used mostly in passing situations -- he considered himself the Trojans' 12th 
man -- Hartsuyker had nine sacks. 
</P>
<P>
On the last, he combined with Seau to bring down Michigan's Michael Taylor on 
fourth down with less than a minute to play in the Rose Bowl game, sealing the 
Trojans' 17-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost like I was a starter because I was in there so much," Hartsuyker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he has been asked to play a more visible role in the absence of 
Seau and linemen Tim Ryan and Dan Owens, the Trojans' sack leaders last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a lot of pressure on him," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a different type of pressure that brought Hartsuyker to USC. 
</P>
<P>
An All-San Diego Section player at Orange Glen High in Escondido, Hartsuyker 
said he made an oral commitment to UCLA, but the Bruins wanted the yes in 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
"They just kept hounding me, to the point where they called me at my 
girlfriend's house one night," he said. "I just didn't like that attitude -- 
the way they went after players. 
</P>
<P>
"I found the people at USC much more to my liking." 
</P>
<P>
He signed with the Trojans, a decision he has not regretted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I made an excellent choice," he said. "We've been to three Rose 
Bowls." 
</P>
<P>
With help, of course, from a certain redheaded linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
A backup as a redshirt freshman, Hartsuyker was a starter in all 12 games his 
sophomore season, making 13 of his 63 tackles behind the line of scrimmage, 
despite playing the last six games with a stress fracture in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
After a 22-14 loss to Michigan in the 1989 Rose Bowl game, he spent the next 
three months with his foot in a cast and missed spring practice, losing his 
starting position to Seau, who had been his backup the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
Hartsuyker was disappointed, but as he told a reporter last spring: "It feels 
better when the guy who starts ahead of you winds up being the fifth guy picked 
in the NFL draft." 
</P>
<P>
The odds are that Hartsuyker won't be the fifth player taken in next year's NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
Hartsuyker, 6 feet 4 and 220 pounds, has had problems maintaining his weight at 
USC. Two years ago, he started the season at 223 pounds and ended it at 206. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess he's one of those guys who has a high rate of metabolism," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a joke, but I'm always talking to him about eating. He had a 
summer job this year and I called his employer and said, 'I don't care what you 
pay him, but just make sure you give him time to eat lunch.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, Allen believes that Hartsuyker will make it to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the quickness and the speed, and he's intelligent," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Hartsuyker isn't counting on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to put that kind of pressure on myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, he will put pressure on opposing quarterbacks to keep them from 
exploiting the Trojans' inexperienced secondary. 
</P>
<P>
And he will keep fans and reporters seeking Marinovich pointed in the right 
direction.

CLARK'S TWO HOMERS LIFT GIANTS OVER REDS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: BUT THE POWER OUTBURST DOESN'T MAKE UP FOR A DISAPPOINTING SEASON FOR 
SAN FRANCISCO'S FIRST BASEMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Going into this season, Roger Craig, among others, rated Will Clark, the San 
Francisco Giants' first baseman, the best player in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
In four seasons, Clark had established himself as an outstanding hitter. Last 
season, he batted .333, hit 23 home runs and drove in 111 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Because Clark was only 26, his manager, Craig, thought it was reasonable to 
expect more from Clark, already an exceptional defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't happen. Injuries have slowed him in the second half of the season, 
but he never did hit the way he did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who will undergo foot surgery after the season, had one of his best 
hitting days since early June Tuesday at Cincinnati to lead the Giants to a 5-3 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
He hit two home runs and a single and drove in three runs to keep the Giants 
alive. After splitting the two-game set, the Giants are 7 1/2 games behind the 
Reds but have only 14 games to play. 
</P>
<P>
With the Dodgers beating Atlanta, the Reds, who begin their final six-game trip 
tonight at Houston, have a 4 1/2-game lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps morale," Clark said, "but I wish I could have done more this season. 
I have had problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, (Tom) Browning made the mistakes. The difference is I was able to 
capitalize on them. I haven't been doing that for some time." 
</P>
<P>
After 70 games this season, Clark had 13 home runs and 55 runs batted in. But 
in the next 77 games he hit only three home runs and drove in 26 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie John Burkett (13-7) had a 5-1 lead and a four-hitter going into the 
ninth, but needed Steve Bedrosian to get the final out with the potential tying 
runs on base. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds believe the race is over in the West, but are concerned about 
Browning. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran left-hander (13-9) has been ineffective since spraining his ankle 
Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"I just haven't had good outings," he said after being chased in the sixth. "I 
haven't pitched well. I have no excuses." 
</P>
<P>
Another starter, Jack Armstrong, relieved in the seventh. Armstrong, bothered 
by a sore elbow, said he still has pain. DAN HAFNER

HIGH-TECH BOAT IS DOCKED; 
</P>
<P>
EXPENSIVE RESEARCH VESSEL WON'T SAIL UNTIL FUNDING IS FOUND FOR A CREW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Last week, in a casual sort of way, the California Department of Fish and Game 
was able to confirm the comeback of sardines, an important saltwater bait fish. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw 'em schooling right in here along the dock," Rick Klingbeil said at the 
DFG's regional office on the Long Beach waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
For the past five years, the DFG has been hearing reports of "unusual 
quantities" of sardines. 
</P>
<P>
"But from a scientific point of view, it's hard to quantify that," Klingbeil 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For that, you need a research vessel. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG has such a vessel -- the Mako, one of the best. New. Eighty feet. Lots 
of high-tech equipment. Cost about $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
All it needs is a crew to run it. 
</P>
<P>
So, hire a crew. 
</P>
<P>
Not so fast. Since the boat was ordered two years ago, the DFG has run into 
critical money problems and instituted a hiring freeze. Officially, even 
Klingbeil doesn't have a job. He is acting program manager for marine resources 
because the position was eliminated in Legislature-imposed budget cuts this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Fleming, the DFG's assistant chief deputy for marine resources in 
Sacramento, said: "A couple of years ago, when the legislature was considering 
authorizing the department to buy this vessel, the revenue picture looked a lot 
better (and) the money was found. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time we didn't set up to crew it because we didn't have a boat (yet). 
Then when we started to do that toward the end of last fiscal year, say, in 
February and March, we were having funding problems." 
</P>
<P>
Even current bail-out legislation to restore some DFG programs isn't expected 
to help the Mako. 
</P>
<P>
So, since being delivered from its Alabama builder in July, there sits the 
Mako, state of the art and spiffy DFG blue with the yellow logo on the bow, 
tied up at the dock. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Mais is the boat's primary designer and caretaker. During 34 years with the 
DFG he was a marine biologist and head of the ocean fisheries sea survey. Now 
retired, he works as a consultant and spends most of his time fussing over the 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
It has a 500-horsepower Caterpillar diesel main engine, a 225-horsepower 
auxiliary to run the hydraulic systems, which include two large trawling 
winches; a 40-kilowatt generator, two radar systems, sonar, color 
depth-sounder, two Loran-C navigational devices, with video plotter; a 
laboratory for scientists and bunks for 12. A fuel capacity of 14,000 gallons 
will allow it to stay at sea for about 35 days. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the roomy galley in air-conditioned comfort, Klingbeil, Mais and 
colleague Linda Nitsos lamented the Mako's plight as a loss to commercial and 
sport fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"We manage the resource for both users," Klingbeil said. "We had a cruise 
planned to tag mako sharks off Southern California. We have a small 
experimental long-line fishery going on right now, which is very controversial 
because it's a commercial and a sport fish, and, because it's a shark species 
with slow growth, we're concerned about that resource being impacted." 
</P>
<P>
Gill nets also are a concern. Conservationists claim commercial gill netters 
are taking significant numbers of sport fish and sea mammals incidental to 
their market fish. The DFG has said it lacks enough information to impose 
restrictions, so the issue's fate will be determined by an initiative on the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say the best way to find out what a gill netter is catching is to 
go out in a gill netter's boat," Klingbeil said. "That's becoming difficult, 
and when you put somebody else on a boat it's going to change the behavior of 
the fisherman and how he operates his gear, and you aren't going to get as good 
information as you think." 
</P>
<P>
Surprise interceptions at sea are more effective. 
</P>
<P>
"But you need a boat to do that," Klingbeil said. 
</P>
<P>
At one time the DFG had three research vessels -- the 100-foot N.B. Scofield, 
the 100-foot Alaska, and the 93-foot Kelp Bass. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd go out and intercept gill-net vessels at sea and try to board them, if 
the fishermen would let us, and if not try to observe them pulling their net 
onto the boat," Klingbeil said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Fleming: "Through attrition, we lost all of those (boats). We have been 
contracting with commercial vessels to try to do our surveys and, for the most 
part, they have just not been adequate." 
</P>
<P>
For a 28-day survey of sardine eggs last May, the DFG paid $94,759 to charter 
the Long Beach-based Yellowfin research boat from the state university system. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming estimates that, including $160,000 in wages for a crew of four -- 
master, motor vessel engineer and two deckhands -- it would cost about $500,000 
to operate the Mako for a year. It's costing $6,000 a year just to maintain it 
at the dock. 
</P>
<P>
"Chartering at first seemed cost-effective, although it wasn't good in terms of 
planning," Klingbeil said. "But then the quality of the boats became a problem. 
It doesn't necessarily call for a vessel this nice to do that work -- you don't 
need trawl gear -- but in terms of being out there for a length of time, being 
comfortable is pretty important. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we'd be taking the boat out to do some of the work Kenny (Mais) 
started back in the '60s with the Alaska, which is near-shore trawling for 
young fish -- primarily the anchovy, sardine and mackerel . . . the forage fish 
for big-game fish." 
</P>
<P>
With hard data, the DFG can project the quality of fishing for the next one or 
two years and set commercial quotas accordingly -- or, if the resource is in 
danger of being depleted, it can stop commercial fishing temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gerald Felando (R-San Pedro), who was instrumental in acquiring the 
Mako, said: "They try to do it on paper, and you can't do it on paper." 
</P>
<P>
Felando's constituency includes commercial fishermen. He complains: "We've 
slipped from being a research state to a law-enforcement state in fish and 
game. We should have kept pouring money into research so we have accurate and 
vital information and research data to establish quotas and limits on the 
resources in the ocean. There just isn't revenue around for that kind of 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The Mako, built by Steiner Shipyard, Inc., of Bayou La Batre, Ala., was 
originally designed as a raised-fo'c'sle trawler. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found the hull, it was just the hull -- no compartments or anything," 
Mais said. "They were building it for some outfit in India, and I guess the 
guys just walked off. I don't know what they were going to use it for. I went 
down last October and looked it over. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been a lot better about six or eight feet longer and a couple of 
feet wider. But it was pretty close." 
</P>
<P>
The boat was completed in May and sailed through the Panama Canal -- and 
Hurricane Fausto -- arriving in July. Since it was 45 feet tall, one concern 
was getting it to its berth under the Queen's Way Bridge adjacent to the Queen 
Mary. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only go under the bridge at low tide," Mais said. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the Mako, with a temporary crew, made its maiden voyage for the DFG: 
a three-day cruise to Catalina to recertify the department's divers. 
</P>
<P>
How long before it sails again? Nobody knows. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) everybody would benefit by it," Felando said.

Scoring his second stakes upset of the summer, Yes I'm Blue came from last to 
defeat Southern California speedster Valiant Pete in the $52,550 Aprisa 
Handicap Tuesday afternoon at Fairplex Park. In June, Yes I'm Blue humbled 
Northern California sprint star Valley Land in a stakes race at Pleasanton. 
</P>
<P>
Dropping back to last in the field of six sprinters, Yes I'm Blue moved to the 
outside approaching the far turn and blew past 4-5 favorite Valiant Pete in the 
final sixteenth, posting a 1 1/2-length victory. Movinglikeawinner was another 
three-quarters back in the six-furlong feature. 
</P>
<P>
Yes I'm Blue surged down the stretch, running the six furlongs in 1:09 2/5, a 
fifth of a second off Drouilly's Boy's track record. Sent off at 5-1, Yes I'm 
Blue paid $12.60 and increased his lifetime earnings to $217,010.

Fairplex Notes 
</P>
<P>
For the second straight day, nobody tabbed six winners in the Pick Six. Today's 
carry-over is $41,887. . . . Beyond Perfection, regarded as one of the 
country's top 2-year-old thoroughbred fillies, is the heavy favorite in today's 
$150,000 Barretts Debutante at 6 1/2 furlongs. In her last race, Beyond 
Perfection won the Grade II Del Mar Debutante Stakes by nine lengths, covering 
a mile in 1:34 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Sibille was the riding star Tuesday, recording a triple aboard longshots 
Lou's Good Morning ($17.20), Viznaga ($94.40) and Vice Dancer ($25.40). David 
Flores and Julio Garcia each had a victory and remained deadlocked for the 
jockey lead with nine apiece. . . . Story Book Ending, a 3-year-old maiden 
filly, collapsed and died of a ruptured heart shortly after finishing sixth in 
the seventh race.

LOS ALAMITOS;

<P>
WINNING REMAINS EASY PROPOSITION FOR T K'S SKIPPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SCHUELEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
T K's Skipper made a shambles of the second $35,000 leg of the American Pacing 
Classic Saturday at Los Alamitos, winning by an eased-up six lengths in 1:52 
3/5. 
</P>
<P>
The time, fastest in the 18-year history of Los Alamitos, trimmed four-fifths 
of a second off the previous American standard, shared by Kalparrin and Half 
Nip. 
</P>
<P>
"T K's Skipper is moving like a powerful pacing machine," said track announcer 
Joe Alto, his voice quivering with emotion as the pacer reached the top of the 
stretch. "He's demolished this field and is in a race against time." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kirby, who drove fourth-place J.A. Bedford, congratulated winning driver 
Joe Anderson in the drivers' room after the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to get my horse to keep up and Joe's going by me saying, 
'Whoa,"' said Kirby, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a special horse right there," Anderson said. "Somebody was blessed when 
they got that one." 
</P>
<P>
Third on the outside, Anderson took T K's Skipper to the lead down the 
backstretch, passed the three-quarter pole in 1:24 2/5 and quickly opened a 
six-length lead turning for home. 
</P>
<P>
"He's real docile until you ask him," said Anderson, who was driving the horse 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"If you just chirp a little he'll take off. He went down the back side in :28 
and felt like he was leaving the starting gate." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Nick Sodano flew the Eastern-based star to Anderson last Wednesday and 
will leave him under his care for another $35,000 leg Saturday and the $150,000 
final Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
T K's Skipper, who has won 17 of 24 starts and earned more than $500,000 this 
year, will be trying to break the world record of 1:52 2/5 for an aged pacer on 
a five-eighths-mile track. He shares the mark with two other horses. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Dan DeJohn, nephew of former ranked heavyweight boxer Mike DeJohn, is 
glad he elected the oval over the ring. 
</P>
<P>
DeJohn is off to his best Los Alamitos start with nine victories in 33 outings. 
He scored his richest triumph when Red Mountain Racer, a 2-year-old colt, 
posted a 1:58 4/5 victory in a $20,000 California Sire Stake race Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I boxed amateur when I was in high school," said the 42-year-old native of 
Syracuse, N.Y., still sporting a right hand with a scar and lump from his teen 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents saw what Mike and two of my other uncles, Ralph and Joey, went 
through and said, 'This kid's not going to get pulverized.' My dad took me to a 
nearby track, Vernon Downs. I always loved being around horses. I came to 
California in 1975." 
</P>
<P>
DeJohn partially credits the fast start of his 14-horse stable to training on 
Stan Bayless' track in Shafter last month between the Sacramento and Los 
Alamitos meets. 
</P>
<P>
"Stan, Bob Johnson, Tim Maier, Mark Anderson and I were all there," said 
DeJohn. "There were 10 wins from the farm on opening weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Jim Perez, 23-year-old son of well-known owners Andy and Victoria 
Perez, also enjoyed a prosperous Saturday when Denali's Thor won a $20,000 
California Sire Stake race for 3-year-old colt pacers in 1:55 1/5 after taking 
the field to the three-quarters in a sizzling 1:23 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a small six-acre farm in Chino with a quarter-mile jogging track," said 
Perez, also crediting his fast start to off-track training. 
</P>
<P>
"We're developing it into a therapy farm and putting a state-of-the-art pool in 
next month." 
</P>
<P>
Perez also trains 2-year-old filly pacing star Two in a Teepee, who has won 
five in a row, but was scratched Friday because of a fever. Perez expects her 
back next week. 
</P>
<P>
Driver Ross Croghan was stunned by Lepton's first defeat of the year in a 
$20,000 California Sire Stake race Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old filly pacer, unbeaten in 10 previous 1990 starts, broke stride 
with the lead in midstretch and caused a four-horse chain-reaction pile-up. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched the replay 20 times, and it's still a mystery to me," said Croghan. 
"She's never run before. She tried to get her speed too quick and just made a 
mistake. But she came out of it sound and should race again next week." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy's Comet and Black on Black were the only horses to finish in the 
six-horse field. Denali's Ginger, Rick Plano driving; Preciosa with Steve 
Desomer and Magna Amber with Kim Vincent were unable to avoid Lepton. All 
drivers and horses appeared to escape injury except Vincent, who canceled his 
Saturday drives. 
</P>
<P>
"I just bruised my tailbone and knee," said Vincent, who hoped to return this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
One patron wagered $20,000 to show on Lepton, the 1-5 favorite. With $23,299 
out of a $24,611 show pool on the favorite, winner Tracy's Comet returned 
$43.80, $21.80 and $82.20; runner-up Black on Black $30 and $159.80, a 
track-record show playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Steward Michael Corley said that non-finishers Denali's Ginger, Preciosa and 
Magna Amber would divide $5,000 in purse money for third, fourth and fifth 
places. Corley cited Rule 19 from the United States Trotting Assn. rule book: 
"If there be any premium for which horses have started but were unable to 
finish, due to an accident, all unoffending horses who did not finish will 
share equally in such premium." 
</P>
<P>
Driver Donald Dancer has returned to New York to resume his career at Yonkers 
Raceway. The 34-year-old reinsman, who has won more than 3,500 races, became 
discouraged after three weeks at Los Alamitos with only three victories in 43 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would get more response than I did in California," said Dancer 
from his Westbury (N.Y.) home. 
</P>
<P>
"I was driving only two or three a night, and I'm used to driving eight or nine 
a night at Yonkers. The longer I waited, the harder it would have been to get 
my horses back in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe a year from now I'll try it again. The place is beautiful, the people 
are nice, and you can't beat the weather. You don't hear about a lot of the 
drivers in New York, but it's a very talented colony. I just couldn't afford to 
stay at this time." 
</P>
<P>
The end of intertrack wagering at Los Alamitos on Del Mar thoroughbred racing 
in the afternoon meant about a 10% increase in handle last weekend. The harness 
handle was $1,056,013 Friday and $1,039,307 Saturday, compared to $963,434 and 
$950,103 the previous weekend.

POMONA VOTERS TO PICK SUCCESSOR TO COUNCILMAN OUSTED IN RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pomona voters -- who recalled a councilman three months ago on charges that he 
harassed employees, maligned minorities and kept government in an uproar -- 
returned to the polls Tuesday to choose a successor from among three candidates 
who promised stability. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to fill the remaining 2 1/2 years of the term of former Councilman C. 
L. (Clay) Bryant were Boyd Bredenkamp, 49, owner of a local doughnut shop; Bob 
Dahms, 33, an electronics consultant, and Nancy Lopez, 52, a housewife and 
community volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
The three candidates have promised to serve with more decorum than Bryant, who 
frequently called the mayor a tramp, once referred to his council colleagues as 
"a bunch of mental cripples" and was sued for labeling a Pomona police officer 
a "psychiatric case." 
</P>
<P>
Bredenkamp and Lopez supported Bryant's recall. Dahms said he stayed out of the 
recall campaign and liked some of Bryant's objectives, but disliked his style. 
</P>
<P>
All of the candidates said they are concerned about crime and eager to promote 
economic development. Their differences have centered on their allegiances. 
Mayor Donna Smith and city employee unions endorsed Bredenkamp, prompting Dahms 
to accuse Bredenkamp of being Smith's puppet. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Nell Soto and Tomas Ursua, who were once political allies of 
Bryant, have backed Dahms, leading to charges that his election would continue 
some of the same policies that prompted the recall. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, with no endorsement from a council member, sought to turn that to her 
advantage by claiming that she was the only independent candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Dahms waged the strongest media campaign, with a series of nine mailers, 
including one to Republicans that showed him working for Republican candidates 
and another to Democrats that showed him in the company of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona) and state Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino) 
both criticized the mailers because their pictures were included, saying they 
had not endorsed Dahms. Bader was so angry that he endorsed Bredenkamp.

CITY SEES CAMPAIGN TO SHED BEDROOM COMMUNITY IMAGE PAY DIVIDENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1980, Simi Valley launched an aggressive campaign aimed at attracting new 
business to boost economic development in what was and still is considered a 
bedroom community. 
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the city added 1.8 million square feet of commercial 
space and 5.3 million square feet of industrial facilities, resulting in an 
estimated 15,000 new jobs, said Assistant City Manager Jay Corey. 
</P>
<P>
The newly created jobs have had a significant effect on the number of residents 
who commute outside the city to work. In 1980, more than 70% of the work force 
in Simi Valley traveled to Los Angeles and elsewhere to earn a living. In 1989, 
with the city's population at more than 103,000, the number of those commuting 
to work was 60%, Corey said. 
</P>
<P>
For some, Simi Valley, which incorporated in 1969, is not progressing fast 
enough. When the east Ventura County city recently threatened to sue the City 
of Los Angeles to block a massive commercial and housing development in nearby 
Chatsworth, citing concerns about increased traffic and pollution, the issue of 
Simi Valley's own economic development was thrust into the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson charged that Simi Valley had failed to 
provide enough jobs for its own residents and should not complain about a 
development from which it would obviously benefit in terms of employment 
opportunities. Moreover, Bernson said Los Angeles was "sick and tired of 
supporting bedroom communities like Simi Valley and Santa Clarita" and 
suggested that Los Angeles impose an employment tax on those who come from 
outside the city to earn their living. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton, who works as an engineering manager at 
Teledyne Systems in Chatsworth, shrugged off Bernson's remarks as nothing more 
than an emotional reaction to Simi Valley's concerns over the planned Porter 
Ranch development. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wants to ship some of his businesses to Simi Valley, we'll take them," 
Stratton said. "I'd love to pick up Teledyne and move the whole thing out to 
Simi Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Some San Fernando Valley firms have done just that. For example, Cardkey 
Systems Inc., with 220 employees, moved from Chatsworth to Simi Valley in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Wilson, senior marketing specialist with the security firm, said the 
company had shopped around the San Fernando Valley for a site on which to build 
before deciding on Simi Valley. He said it was cheaper to lease space in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Fernando Valley is becoming very expensive to run a business in," 
Wilson said. "Over the last few years, it has just skyrocketed." Wilson 
attributed the high cost of leasing space, in part, to the advent of Warner 
Center in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
He said about 30% of Cardkey's employees live in the San Fernando Valley, with 
the rest in Simi Valley and other parts of Ventura County. When the company 
announced it was going to move, he said, only two employees left because of the 
commute. 
</P>
<P>
Bugle Boy, a national clothing manufacturer, also made the move from Chatsworth 
to Simi Valley in 1989 for basically the same reason as Cardkey -- it was 
cheaper, said Genevieze Squires, a company official. Bugle Boy employs about 
500 people, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides better land value, the city's location and quality of life have played 
a big part in attracting new businesses, city officials said. For example, Simi 
Valley is within 30 minutes of Burbank Airport and about an hour from Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Simi Valley has consistently been listed among the safest cities 
of its size in the state in terms of major crimes committed each year, 
according to FBI statistics. The city also enjoys the highest median household 
income in Ventura County at $48,700. 
</P>

Some of the other businesses that have located in Simi Valley since 1980 
include Farmers Insurance Group; First Interstate Bancard Co.; Micom Systems 
Inc., a manufacturer of data communication systems; and Whittaker Corp., which 
makes air traffic control systems and radar tracking equipment. The Upjohn Co.

When Jack Lower was looking to reinvest his savings in 1988, he went to Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan in Hemet where he had $34,000 on deposit. A teller there 
suggested that he put it in bonds being sold by American Continental Corp., 
Lincoln's parent. 
</P>
<P>
Lower did, but now rues the day. American Continental's securities -- 
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds -- now are virtually worthless. 
</P>
<P>
But Lower, 75, of San Jacinto took some satisfaction out of the news Tuesday 
that American Continental's former chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., and three 
other American and Lincoln officials were indicted on 42 counts of securities 
fraud and related charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this will mean a long prison term for Mr. Keating, and his accountants 
and his lawyers," he said, adding that his investment in the bonds "was 
practically everything we had saved, both my wife and I working all our lives." 
</P>
<P>
The sentiment is widely shared by others who lost money by investing in bonds 
issued by American Continental, which filed for bankruptcy in April, 1989. The 
next day, federal regulators seized control of Irvine-based Lincoln. The 
thrift's failure is expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But American Continental's collapse has already hit the pocketbooks of more 
than 15,000 investors -- many of them elderly and depositors of Lincoln -- who 
bought nearly $200 million in bonds sold through the thrift. Some of the 
investors thought that the bonds were insured. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has contended that the bondholders should have known otherwise, noting 
that the public prospectus accompanying the bonds stated clearly that the bonds 
were not insured and were not the same as certificates of deposit. Also, 
Keating has contended, the bondholders are not as innocent and unsophisticated 
as they make themselves out to be; they bought the bonds lured by their more 
attractive yields, often 10% or more. 
</P>
<P>
Such arguments don't hold much water with investors such as Donald Mikami, a 
43-year-old Fountain Valley dentist, who lost $25,000 by investing in American 
Continental's junk bonds. The money was being set aside for his and his wife's 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
He called the charges against Keating "a modest beginning." 
</P>
<P>
"We're all elated that finally some serious action has been taken, some 
non-handslapping," he said. "We want to see some blood, we want to see some 
teeth, or at least a pound of flesh." 
</P>
<P>
Norman Lapin, a Los Angeles accountant whose parents invested $120,000 in 
American Continental bonds, said people hold Keating personally responsible for 
their lost savings. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew what was going on," Lapin said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the loss hasn't ruined his parents financially, but it has shaken them, 
especially his father, a worrier who is 75 years old and the retired owner of a 
dry cleaning plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see it in my father, he won't spend a penny anymore to do anything," 
Lapin said. "He grew up in the Depression, and it's like somebody slapping you 
again. For the first time in his life, he had felt secure." 
</P>
<P>
Another investor, Harold Rosenberg, a Sherman Oaks lawyer who declined to say 
how much he lost, said Keating is a product of his times. 
</P>
<P>
"(Keating) put it very bluntly, he told the world that the government gave him 
this opportunity. There it was staring him in the face and he did it," 
Rosenberg said. "I'm not built that way. I wouldn't know what to do with the 
fancy china or the $2-million salary."

HOUSE PASSES TEXTILE QUOTA BILL, BUT VETO LOOMS; 
</P>
<P>
APPAREL: THE ADMINISTRATION OPPOSES THE LEGISLATION AS A THREAT TO 
TRADE-LIBERALIZATION TALKS IN GENEVA.

<P>
The House approved legislation Tuesday to protect the U.S. textile industry, 
but in a victory for the Bush Administration, the vote fell short of the 
two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed overwhelmingly in the Senate before the House backed it 271 to 
149, would impose stiff quotas on imports of textiles, clothing and shoes, 
effectively raising the price of such goods to limit job losses in domestic 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
Ardent supporters of the legislation -- mostly from the South, where the bulk 
of the U.S. textile industry is based -- contend that it is needed to keep 2 
million mostly low-paid jobs from falling victim to foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of these plants are in smaller towns, and when their factories shut 
down there is no work elsewhere," said Rep. James Quillen (R-Tenn.). "A 
philosophical discussion of free trade is all well and good, but it does not 
pay the rent or put food on the table." 
</P>
<P>
The White House, which has said that President Bush will veto the bill, opposes 
the legislation as a threat to the global trade-liberalization talks under way 
in Geneva. It has warned that, if the bill becomes law, it would usher in a 
dangerous era of trade wars. 
</P>
<P>
"It would send the wrong message to retreat now from the world economy and 
build protectionist walls just when the reform governments of Eastern Europe, 
Latin America and Asia need our leadership in forging a more open international 
economy," Bush wrote Monday in a letter to House leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers opposing the bill argued that textiles and apparel are already among 
the most sheltered U.S. industries and do not need additional protection. 
</P>
<P>
"These industries are just going through the same ups and downs every other 
American business experiences," said Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.). "Moving a plant 
so it is closer to the interstate (highway) has had far more impact on people 
in my part of the country than all the foreign competition put together." 
</P>
<P>
Among those opposing the bill are many U.S. apparel firms that rely on overseas 
suppliers. For example, Los Angeles-based Carole Little, a women's sportswear 
and dress designer, makes about half its merchandise overseas and often buys 
foreign textiles for the goods it produces domestically. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to see the government interfere in these issues," said Leonard 
Rabinowitz, the firm's chairman. "We don't think it helps." 
</P>
<P>
Up until the last moment, the bill's opponents feared that they would not get 
the 145 votes needed to sustain a veto. Roughly 15 more Republicans than 
expected supported the White House after the Administration launched a belated 
lobbying campaign to limit support. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional strategists say the bill appears doomed for the year. 
</P>
<P>
The fight over textile quotas is a recurring one on Capitol Hill, where two 
similar bills have been approved in the past five years -- only to be vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
This year the battle was more intense because textile forces -- joined by shoe 
manufacturers, sugar and cotton growers, shipbuilders and steelmakers -- are 
fearful that the Bush Administration plans to reduce their long-protected 
position in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
To win concessions from poorer countries to help U.S. industries expand abroad, 
the White House hopes to phase out the worldwide system of quotas that holds 
back textile and apparel exports from many Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of Tuesday's legislation, although acknowledging their disappointment 
over the vote, said the strong support for the textile bill should send a 
signal to the Administration not to sell out the industry's interests in the 
Uruguay Round of trade talks scheduled to be completed this December. 
</P>
<P>
"The White House better go very, very easy," argued Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.). 
"If they phase out textile quotas, they're going to have a hard time getting 
the implementing legislation out of here." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials believe, however, that the textile industry's third 
failure in a row to mount enough support to force the bill into law should give 
the White House added clout with other nations as the trade talks go down to 
the wire. 
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial to the health of the world trading system that this bill be 
killed," said William Cline, an analyst at the Institute for International 
Economics in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise," Cline added -- in a reference to a highly protectionist 1930s law 
that helped make the Great Depression far worse -- "it could turn out to be the 
Smoot-Hawley of the 1990s."

NEEDING A HIT, NEXT UNVEILS ITS NEW COMPUTERS; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: STEVEN JOBS' LATEST OFFERINGS DRAW PRAISE, BUT ANALYSTS SAY THE 
FIRM MUST PROVE THAT ITS MACHINES ARE THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two years after launching the first Next Computer model amid a frenzy of hype 
-- only to see it fail in the marketplace -- Steven P. Jobs returned to 
Symphony Hall here Tuesday with a new series of products and the future of his 
company hanging in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jobs, co-founder of Apple Computer, showed that he has not abandoned 
his lofty goal of revolutionizing the desktop computer, Tuesday's announcements 
represented a practical response to those who criticized the original Next 
machine for its high price and lack of software. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally praised the new products and said they should remove some of 
the doubts about Next's future. But they added that Next must show that its new 
computers provide the most cost-effective solutions for specific problems. 
</P>
<P>
The new Next product line maintains innovations such as compact disc-quality 
sound and a highly "user-friendly" software system, but the cheapest machine 
now costs $4,995 -- compared to $6,500 for the original model. The company also 
introduced a color machine and a new high-end system that can incorporate a 
high-performance graphics and video processor. All the computers will now use a 
new microprocessor from Motorola that allows them to operate three times faster 
than the earlier machine. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important, Lotus Development Corp. and a number of other major software 
publishers announced plans to release software for Next. The Lotus product is a 
spreadsheet for financial analysis, but it contains major innovations that 
Lotus Chief Executive Jim Manzi said were the fruit of a four-year effort to 
"reconceptualize what a spreadsheet is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Jobs said Next had secured 15,000 firm orders for the new computers, double the 
number of old machines that analysts believe have been sold. Shipments of the 
low-cost Next will begin in November, though the color machines will not be 
available until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that (Jobs) is back in the race again," said Richard Schaffer, 
principal of the New York consulting firm Technologic Partners. "Before, we 
were being polite, but it was over. Now he has provided a family of machines 
whose performance and price are best-in-class." 
</P>
<P>
Schaffer cautioned, however, that this assessment was based on the assumptions 
that the new software would be available on time and that the machines perform 
as advertised. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart Alsop, a Silicon Valley personal computer consultant, characterized the 
Next announcement as "good enough to allow them to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Jobs will reveal few details about the financial condition of privately held 
Next, which he founded four years ago after being ousted from Apple. But Next 
was one of the best-funded start-up ventures ever, having raised some $200 
million from investors ranging from Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot to the 
Japanese electronics firm Canon. And most analysts believe that the firm has 
plenty of cash. 
</P>
<P>
The new products represent a retreat from one of the major innovations 
contained in the earlier Next -- the effective, but very expensive, optical 
disk drives. Traditional floppy disk drives and high-capacity hard disk drives 
are now standard equipment, with the optical drives available only as an option 
on some models. 
</P>
<P>
The low-cost Nextstation also abandons the trademark one-foot cube shape in 
favor of a flat, pizza-box-like profile, though the more expensive models are 
still cube-shaped. 
</P>
<P>
Next has also altered its tight focus on the higher education market in favor 
of a broader sales strategy aimed at the corporate world. Specifically, Next is 
targeting business users who write their own computer programs to carry out 
specialized tasks, a market dominated by workstation vendors such as Sun 
Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Next's program-writing system, which has been licensed by International 
Business Machines for use in future products, has been widely praised as an 
important breakthrough in making applications development easy and efficient. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most productive machine for a programmer, and it's the easiest 
machine for the user," said Hadar Pedhazur, a vice president at First Boston 
Corp., which has agreed to purchase at least several dozen of the Next 
machines.

Agency to Assume Eastern Pension Plans: The federal agency that insures private 
pensions agreed to take control of Eastern Airlines' under-funded pension plans 
while the airline's parent pledged to eventually bring the plans back to 
financial health. The Miami-based airline, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, 
said it reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. to assume 
responsibility for the plans, which are to provide retirement benefits for 
thousands of workers.

UNIONS TO SEEK BANKS' HELP IN THEIR NEW BID FOR UAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The unions at United Airlines plan to hold a meeting with banks, perhaps as 
early as today, in an effort to interest them in a new, $3.9-billion offer for 
the airline's parent, UAL Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The new offer of $175 to $180 a share is said to include around $150 in cash. 
The rest consists of notes worth around $30 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The unions, whose members include United's pilots, mechanics and flight 
attendants, have invited representatives of about 20 banks to the meeting. The 
unions face an Oct. 9 deadline to have their financing for the deal completed. 
</P>
<P>
The new offer would be financed with $2 billion in bank credit and $2 billion 
from other sources. Alternatives under discussion include notes from aircraft 
and engine suppliers, equity from the pilots' retirement plan and the 
sale-leaseback of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal, quoting anonymous sources, reported in its Tuesday 
editions that an unnamed foreign airline is interested in participating in the 
deal. UAL's shares rose $7.625 Tuesday to $105 in response to the report. 
</P>
<P>
One airline that might be interested is British Airways. It has a marketing 
agreement with United, and it joined in an earlier, failed bid for UAL Corp. 
The failure of that $300-a-share bid last October touched off one of the 
biggest stock market plunges in history. 
</P>
<P>
British Airway's role would be limited by federal rules that restrict 
foreigners from owning more than 20% of a U.S. airline. A spokesman for British 
Airways in New York declined to comment on its possible participation in a UAL 
buyout. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the unions have lined up four banks -- including Los Angeles-based 
Security Pacific Corp. -- to help raise $2 billion. But neither Security nor 
the other banks -- Manufacturers Hanover, First Chicago and Bankers Trust -- 
have committed any of their own funds to the proposed deal.

PEOPLE: MAXWELL TO RETIRE AS CHAIRMAN OF FANNIE MAE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David O. Maxwell will retire as chairman of the Federal National Mortgage Assn. 
effective Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
He will be replaced by Vice Chairman James A. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Roger E. Birk will continue as president of Fannie Mae, a congressionally 
chartered, shareholder-owned company and the nation's largest investor in home 
mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson joined Fannie Mae in January from Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., where he 
was a managing director. He also served as president of Public Strategies, a 
Washington consulting firm, and worked as an executive assistant to former Vice

A QUESTION OF BASIC RIGHTS?; 
</P>
<P>
ZONING: DESIGNERS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARE ASKING IF THE CITY COUNCIL WENT TOO 
FAR BY RESTRICTING THE SIZE AND DESIGN OF A MOSQUE IN A GRANADA HILLS 
NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>

As Los Angeles sprawls ever more chaotically across hills and valleys, fights 
over ugly mini-malls and mammoth high-rises are commonplace. But now a quarrel 
over the design of a San Fernando Valley mosque has raised questions about how 
far local officials should go in regulating design. 
</P>
<P>
Scarcely had the City Council required that the mosque limit its membership in 
its first year to 250 and be built Spanish style -- without traditional domes 
or minarets -- to fit the Granada Hills neighborhood, when designers and 
religious leaders expressed grave concern about the ruling's effects. 
</P>
<P>
"We had design police with Hitler and Stalin who produced the ugliest 
architecture we have, and I don't believe the City Council should be dictating 
design and style," said Bouje Bernkopf, president of the San Fernando Valley 
chapter of the American Institute of Architects. "Design is a process of 
thought just as speech is a process of thought, and the U.S. Constitution 
guarantees freedom of speech and therefore freedom of expression." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Atkinson, director of public communications for the California Churches 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, said he did not understand how the 
council could limit the mosque's membership. Mohammed Mohiuddin, president of 
the Islamic Center of Northridge, said the Muslim community had sought 
permission for up to 550 members. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the council may have intruded on the protection of religious 
freedom," Atkinson said, "and we would find that a very disturbing and a 
dangerous precedent." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 10-0 to approve the mosque but imposed 44 conditions -- 
according to city officials the most restrictions ever placed on a house of 
worship here. Mayor Tom Bradley on Monday called the council's action "an 
affront to religious freedom" and called on the Cultural Affairs Commission to 
develop guidelines for designing religious buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Several limitations attempted to satisfy traffic concerns. Worshipers are 
barred from parking on Encino Avenue in front of the mosque and must employ a 
traffic control officer on Fridays, the Muslims' holy day. The Islamic Center 
of Northridge expects to complete the $1.8-million, 18,000-square-foot 
structure within a year. 
</P>
<P>
When it opens, it will join many houses of worship that have overcome 
neighborhood objections. When members first proposed the Hsi Lai Buddhist 
Temple in Hacienda Heights 10 years ago, residents showed up before County 
Supervisors to object to its size. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after 2,000 people visited on the Temple during the Chinese New 
Year, residents complained about illegally parked cars and traffic on Hacienda 
Boulevard. The county later put up no parking street signs. The Buddhists 
acknowledge there were misunderstandings with neighbors over the site, which 
includes the largest Buddhist monastery-temple complex in the Western 
Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't talk to the neighbors very much in the beginning," said Anthony 
Yang, project architect. "People said we were putting up a huge monster temple 
with architecture that wouldn't meld into the neighborhood." Today, both sides 
agree there are fewer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
When the Sikh Study Circle sought to build a $1.5-million domed temple in the 
Los Feliz area in 1987, some residents complained that the 300 or so Sikhs, who 
had worshiped in an old restaurant, brought noise and parking problems to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
A Sikh leader conceded that fistfights had occurred at the temple due to an 
internal dispute, but said that dissension had ended. The council approved the 
project but required the Sikhs to soundproof windows, build an eight-foot fence 
and not meet outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fred Register, recently retired conference minister of the United Church of 
Christ in Southern California, said that residents increasingly "would prefer 
not to have any religious buildings around. . . . It's always on the assumption 
that it will increase traffic and cause property values to depreciate. I don't 
think there's any evidence for that." 
</P>
<P>
Mohiuddin said that as far back as 1978 the council rejected the Islamic 
Center's plan to transform a Northridge home into a mosque, saying it would 
create traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Now worshiping in a Northridge house, the Muslims spent a year seeking a site 
and another preparing for hearings before four city agencies. After Bradley's 
comments, congregation leaders said they may re-seek permission to build a 
small dome and minaret. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley mosque is one of about 30 in the Los Angeles region, including 
traditional structures with domes and minarets in Claremont, Riverside and 
Walnut, said Dr. Maher Hathout, former director of the Muslim Public Affairs 
Council. Although Islam requires no special form for houses of prayer, 
architects have built mosques with domes and minarets since the 13th Century, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey J. Fields, senior rabbi at Wilshire Boulevard Temple, said he understood 
some of the Granada Hills neighbors' worries. "But when you begin to demand of 
churches, synagogues and mosques that they all look alike, we are in a sense . 
. . getting out a signal that this society is somehow to be homogenized rather 
than an expression of what America really is, and that is a great pluralistic 
society."

3M, BILLBOARD ARTIST IN DISPUTE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: HE SAYS THE COMPANY IS CENSORING HIM BY BACKING OUT OF A DEAL TO ERECT AN 
ANTI-TOBACCO INDUSTRY BILLBOARD. 
</P>

"Who's burning America?" 
</P>
<P>
That's the question Los Angeles artist Charles Sherman has been longing to ask 
Southland residents for the past three months. But according to Sherman, a 
major corporation is trying to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman signed a contract in June with 3M National Advertising Co., a 
subsidiary of the Minnesota-based 3M Corp., to erect an anti-tobacco industry 
billboard at Crenshaw and Washington boulevards. And while local 3M officials 
approved the project and cashed his check in August, the 43-year-old artist 
claims the company is attempting to back out of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"3M reserves the right to refuse to display any message in which the content or 
the presentation is in questionable taste," said Peter D. Bear, manager of 
government and community affairs at the Chicago headquarters of 3M National 
Advertising. "In its present form, Mr. Sherman's artwork is just too 
controversial." 
</P>
<P>
In June, Sherman designed a 12-by-24-foot billboard that depicts a massive 
American flag being ignited by a glowing cigarette. Initially, the singed flag 
surrounded the inscription: "JESSE HELMS IS BURNING AMERICA." To the right of 
the flag, Sherman printed the following text: "JUST SAY NO TO TAXPAYER 
SUBSIDIES TO THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY." 
</P>
<P>
Sherman said he created the piece because he believes American taxpayers are 
being duped by Helms' anti-NEA obscenity stance. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get people thinking about who's really burning the nation," 
Sherman said. "Is it a few NEA-financed artists who create controversial 
pictures judged obscene by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)? Or is it Helms himself, 
the most visible congressional (supporter of) the tobacco industry, a business 
whose products have been linked to the deaths of more than 390,000 Americans 
per year?" 
</P>
<P>
3M National Advertising, which owns 300 billboards in Los Angeles and 2,700 
more across the nation, is no stranger to the arts. Last year, the firm's 
parent company contributed nearly $3 million to arts, media and cultural 
groups. The 3M-affiliated McKnight Foundation -- named after former 3M chairman 
William L. McKnight -- also recently announced plans to donate an additional 
$28 million to arts-related organizations in the Minnesota area. 
</P>
<P>
But three weeks ago, the billboard firm enraged local art activists when 
executives in the Chicago headquarters declared guerrilla artist Robbie Conal's 
West Hollywood anti-censorship billboard "too controversial" and ordered it to 
be taken down. 
</P>
<P>
Conal's billboard -- which depicted an acidic portrait of Helms with a caption 
that read: "ARTIFICIAL ART OFFICIAL" -- was reinstalled the next day upon order 
from the same officials who had demanded its removal. 
</P>
<P>
Conal, who plans to put up a second art billboard after his current piece on 
Santa Monica Boulevard comes down in November, said he supports Sherman in his 
battle with 3M. 
</P>
<P>
"Giant corporations are very touchy about their self-image," Conal said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things I learned from my experience with 3M National is that you 
really have to hone your angle of attack. It almost requires the delicate touch 
of a Zen archer to get your concept past the corporate inspectors," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman first met with 3M National field sales representative Christine Edwards 
on June 26, submitted a mock-up of his design and wrote the company a $1,705 
check. 
</P>
<P>
On July 19, 3M wrote Sherman a letter requesting alterations in his design. The 
letter, accompanied by Sherman's uncashed check, explained that when Edwards 
sought approval from 3M's legal counsel she was informed by "constituents at 
the corporate office" that Sherman's text for the billboard was "too 
controversial." Sherman was told if he eliminated the anti-Helms saying that 3M 
National would be "more than glad" to display his message. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman sent 3M a new mock-up, resubmitted his check and authorized 3M's final 
fax proposal of his design Aug. 14. His check was cashed in Chicago on Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Sherman said he received a call from Dennis LeBlanc, director 
of advertising at 3M National's Woodland Hills office, demanding he remove the 
burning American flag from his design because of the current Middle East 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"This has absolutely nothing to do with the trouble in Iraq," Sherman said. 
"It's just a case of one big corporation being afraid to step on the toes of 
another. The tobacco industry is one of their biggest clients." 
</P>
<P>
Neither LeBlanc nor Edwards could be reached for comment, but Bear said that 
rejection of Sherman's design had nothing to do with the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"3M is not opposed to displaying messages that criticize the tobacco industry," 
Bear said. "We believe that the image of the burning flag is likely to be 
highly offensive or distressful to viewers." 
</P>
<P>
Bear said he has instructed the Woodland Hills office to reimburse Sherman for 
his cashed check plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to censor the content of the man's message or pass judgment 
on his art," Bear said. "There may be a universe of other possible ways for an 
artist to get that particular political or social idea across. But in Mr. 
Sherman's case, his design is clearly something that we are not going to 
display."

'FLASH' SUITS UP FOR A SIZZLING TV RATINGS RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo love "The Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
"I think 'The Simpsons' is the best thing on TV," said Bilson. 
</P>
<P>
But Bilson and De Meo probably won't be seeing a lot of Bart and clan this 
season. The two are the executive producers of CBS' lavish new action series, 
"The Flash," which has the unenviable task of competing not only against the 
hot Fox cartoon series on Thursdays at 8 p.m. but also NBC's ratings 
powerhouse, "The Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
"We have no control over (scheduling)," said Harvey Shephard, president of 
Warner Bros. TV, the studio behind "The Flash." "We are clearly not thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
CBS had an understandable strategy in mind when it announced the show's 
scheduling last spring. Based on a DC comic book character who is the fastest 
man alive, "The Flash" was intended to challenge "The Cosby Show" for young 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"The day after we announced," Bilson said, "Fox announced 'The Simpsons' (would 
be moving from Sundays to Thursdays). Nobody knew they were going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a total ambush," De Meo said. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't ambushing us; they were doing the same thing we are -- ambushing 
'Cosby,' " Bilson said. "The last thing we want to do is to be up against 'The 
Simpsons.' It's our audience." 
</P>
<P>
To combat their predicament, CBS and Warner Bros. have been aggressively 
marketing "The Flash" in advance of its two-hour premiere Thursday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough time period, and every effort has to be made," said Doug 
Duitsman, vice president in charge of promotion, advertising and publicity for 
Warner Bros. television. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, Warner flew banners over beaches on both coasts. The studio 
also unveiled the pilot last Saturday with a big bash at its Burbank lot. 
</P>
<P>
CBS started its promotion in July during baseball's All-Star game, said George 
Schweitzer, senior vice president of communications at the CBS Broadcast Group. 
"It's not being sold as a comic book. It's being sold like 'Batman' -- dark and 
mysterious and exciting. The promos have a theatrical quality." 
</P>
<P>
CBS also launched ad campaigns on radio and cable TV, Schweitzer said. "We 
bought commercials during the wrestling matches on USA Cable and during the old 
'Batman' shows on the Family Channel." 
</P>
<P>
But the hype doesn't stop there. The current Flash comic books feature ads for 
the series, and "Flash" posters are being displayed in malls and in 2,300 
K-marts across the country. Four-minute promos of the series have aired at all 
Six Flags amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
"The Flash" had its genesis as a TV series two years ago, when Warner Bros., 
which owns DC Comics, tried to develop TV movies based on some of the 
characters for CBS. Bilson and De Meo conceived one that featured several 
superheroes, including the Flash, who had first been introduced to readers 50 
years ago. None of the projects was made, but when Jeff Sagansky became CBS 
Entertainment president last January, he expressed interest in creating a 
series featuring the Flash. 
</P>
<P>
"It had been so long since there had been a great superhero," Sagansky said. "I 
was a regular reader of the Flash and all the DC comics." 
</P>
<P>
In the pilot airing Thursday, the life of a police forensic scientist (former 
soap star John Wesley Shipp) is transformed one night when his lab is struck by 
lightning. The resulting chemical spill causes him to become faster than a 
speeding bullet; he uses his new-found power to fight criminals under the guise 
of the Flash. 
</P>
<P>
Bilson and De Meo wrote the pilot in January and began filming in May. It was 
finished only late last week. "There are 125 special effects," Bilson said. 
"It's done on a grand scale. Even the score is done on a grand scale." 
</P>
<P>
And so is the budget. "The Flash" is quite literally the Six Million Dollar 
Man. The pilot cost $6 million, and it's been reported that each one-hour 
episode will cost about $1.6 million. The superhero's suit alone cost 
approximately $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The suit itself is a makeup effect," De Meo said. "John had to have his entire 
body cast. The suit is made out of latex. It was quite a process getting it." 
</P>
<P>
"The suit was critical," Bilson added. "You can't, after 'Batman,' have a guy 
running around in tights." 
</P>
<P>
Both agree that audiences probably have a misguided notion of what the Flash is 
really all about. "We are fighting against preconceptions of other superhero 
shows that have been on TV in the past," De Meo said. "The simplest analogy is 
that it's close to 'Batman' the movie, not 'Batman' the (TV) show. We never get 
silly." 
</P>
<P>
CBS is giving "The Flash" ample chance to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very tough time period," Sagansky said. If viewers miss the premiere on 
Thursday, they can catch a repeat Sept. 28 at 11:30 p.m. And, as a test, the 
second episode will air next Thursday at 8:30 p.m., opposite less formidable 
competition: Fox's new series "Babes," NBC's "A Different World" and the second 
half hour of ABC's "The Father Dowling Mysteries." 
</P>
<P>
"They (CBS) are not going to waste this show," Bilson said. "Look at what else 
they have on. Not only does this cost a lot of money, it has the potential of 
being the first action-adventure show to work at 8 p.m. since 'The A-Team.' The 
bottom line around here is that when 'The Simpsons' was announced, everybody 
said, 'Just make a good show. If it's a good show, it will stay on the air.' "

THE ART COLLECTION WITHOUT A COUNTRY; 
</P>
<P>
ART: TOURING EXHIBIT MAY HOLD THE ONLY KUWAIT MUSEUM TREASURES TO HAVE SURVIVED 
THE INVASION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Art experts in the United States and Europe fear that one of the world's most 
renowned collections of Islamic art may have been destroyed or looted by Iraqi 
forces occupying Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Information about the fate of the Kuwait National Museum's 20,000-item Dar al 
Athar al Islamiyyah collection is, like much of the news out of the ravaged 
country, sketchy at best. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Iraqi embassies in Washington and London say they have no 
knowledge of the fate of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
But officials of the Kuwait government and the curator of the collection say 
the bulk of the artworks may not have survived the Aug. 2 Iraqi takeover. The 
invasion, ironically, came just two weeks after a small fraction of the art 
collection was shipped out of Kuwait for a European and American tour that 
opened Aug. 6 at Leningrad's famed Hermitage. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything valuable has been taken from the museum. Everything has been 
looted," said an angry Ali al Sabah, the press representative at the Kuwait 
Embassy in Washington, 
</P>
<P>
Al Sabah said he learned of the collection's fate from unidentified witnesses 
in Kuwait. Officials at the Kuwait Embassy in London could not confirm their 
Washington colleague's report. 
</P>
<P>
"We have read in the Arabic newspapers that his highness, the Emir of Kuwait, 
sent a telegram about the destruction to an Islamic conference," said Ghada 
Qaddumi, curator of the Dar al Athar al Islamiyyah. "The emir said that 
everything was sacked and pillaged, even banks, schools, hospitals and the Dar 
al Athar al Islamiyyah. It makes me very, very sad, of course. I don't want to 
believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Qaddumi, who studied at Harvard, was away from Kuwait on vacation when the 
invasion hit. She was reached in Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic art collection, which spans 13 centuries, was amassed by Sheik 
Nasser Sabah al Ahmed al Sabah and his wife, Sheika Hussa, beginning 15 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although the collection is widely admired, some in the Islamic art field 
believe that its fame has been, to some degree, bought. The sheik and sheika 
have flown in scholars from around the world to see the collection in Kuwait 
City and they sponsored several book-length publications written about it. 
</P>
<P>
The new tour of 114 objects from the collection was being looked upon as a 
chance for the Kuwaitis to prove that the Dar al Athar al Islamiyyah could 
stand on its own merits. 
</P>
<P>
The pieces now in Leningrad were selected by Esin Atil, a historian of Islamic 
art at the Sackler and Freer galleries, which are part of the Smithsonian 
Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the items I would have liked to have included were just too fragile, I 
thought, to go out on tour for a year and a half," said Atil. "There were 
others that would have been wonderful to include, but I did not think it was 
right to take all the best objects from the museum for that length of time." 
</P>
<P>
The pieces on tour are now the only ones known to be safe. They are scheduled 
to next go to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore in December for a two-month 
stay and then move on to Ft Worth, Tex., Atlanta, St. Louis and Richmond, Va. 
before going on to Europe. There are no plans for them to come to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the invasion, however, there is some question as to whether the 
exhibition will make it to the United States. After the invasion, President 
Bush froze all Kuwaiti assets in this country, and tour officials want to be 
sure the collection will not be seized by customs agents when it arrives. 
</P>
<P>
Several sources said that at the time of the invasion, Sheika Hussa, who is the 
daughter of a former emir, was visiting her children at their schools in 
Europe. Sheik Nasser, who is the nephew of the current emir, was in Kuwait but 
managed to escape to Saudi Arabia. They are reportedly staying at their London 
home, awaiting the birth of their fourth child. 
</P>
<P>
In a forward written to a book on the collection, Sheik Nasser said he first 
became interested in Islamic art as a boy when he was sent to school in 
Jerusalem. His Oxford-educated wife, however, was the driving force behind the 
collection. As a couple, they bought their first piece -- a 14th-Century Mamluk 
enamel-worked glass bottle -- in London in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The couple gathered objects from a wide variety of countries and regions, 
including a rare type of Safari medallion carpet from 15th-Century Iran, an 
8th-Century carved niche from Syria and the oldest astrolabe in existence. In 
addition, they acquired impressive holdings of illuminated manuscripts, richly 
colored-glass pieces, ornate metal boxes, paintings, geometrically patterned 
ceramic tiles, jewelry and thousands of gold coins. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Nasser, who is a businessman involved with banking, real estate and 
trading companies, also bought a 10% interest in Christie's art auction house. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s the couple hired Egyptian architect Hassan Fathi to design a 
museum to house the collection. But government officials proposed instead a 
building at the Kuwait National Museum complex. Designed in 1958 and completed 
in 1981, the complex comprises four buildings and a planetarium overlooking the 
gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Nasser and Sheika Hussa agreed to make a permanent loan of their 
collection to the museum, and she became its director. The museum formally 
opened in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is considerable concern about the collection in art circles, 
there is some optimism about its fate. There is also some doubt that the Iraqis 
would pillage such an important resource. 
</P>
<P>
British art conservator Kirsty Norman was in Kuwait helping to oversee the 
packing of the objects that went to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I saw the museum was on Aug. 31," said Norman from her home in 
London, "when I drove past it. It didn't look as if it had been damaged or 
disturbed in any way. Everything looked quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Norman was originally scheduled to leave Kuwait on Aug. 2, the day of the 
invasion. She did not get out until Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she had been told by officials at the London office of Gulf 
International, which oversees many of the sheik's businesses, that they, too, 
were in the dark about the fate of the collection. 
</P>
<P>
Repeated requests to interview Gulf International officials went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
"Reports of a museum being pillaged by an invading army are not at all 
uncommon," said Thomas Lentz, curator of Islamic art at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art. "The country being invaded might use these reports to help 
gather sympathy for its cause. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the reports do turn out to be true, and sometimes not." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Islamic art scholars, while eager for news of the collection, 
have taken a wait-and-see attitude. "I can do nothing but worry," said tour 
curator Atil. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a tragedy if a collection like this, which was carefully chosen to 
include all regions, all periods and all types and techniques, was gone," Atil 
said. "There is no way to put a dollar amount on the collection, but that is 
not the important part, anyway. The loss would have to be measured in terms of 
culture and scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ARTWORKS IN A STATE OF UNCERTAINTY 
</P>
<P>
A collection of treasured Islamic art may have been looted or destroyed in the 
Iraqi takeover of Kuwait. But two weeks before the invasion, a handful of works 
were shipped out of the country for a European and American tour. Officials at 
the Iraqi embassies in Washington and London maintain that they have no 
knowledge of the fate of the museum or specific works. The works below, 
however, were in the Kuwait National Museum at the time of the invasion.

'LOOK': A FUNNY DEATH WARMED OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Show up for "One Last Look," a play at Crossroads Theatre, and a 
flower-bedecked casket is stage center. Services open with soaring gospels and 
spirituals from a robed women's chorale. 
</P>
<P>
When mourners in the funeral parlor get up to peer into the box at the late 
Eustace Baylor, you begin to feel queasy. Did you take the wrong turnoff? 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly there's a vocal fuss at the back of the house. At the same time, a 
blind man with a cane stumbles up to the coffin and sticks his hand into the 
open casket to feel if it's really old Eustace. A brawl erupts when rival 
members of the deceased's extended families -- his West Indian wife and his 
African-American mistress (and their warring offspring) -- fight over who is 
going to sit where. 
</P>
<P>
Even the ghost of Eustace (a droll Lincoln Kilpatrick) shows up. This is an 
uproarious show, death warmed over, with some unexpected scorching drama 
(particularly from the wives, Masequa Myers and Amentha Dymally). There is a 
hilarious turn by busybody griever Susie Garrett, who carps about those "West 
Indian monkeys." Raymond Allen's formal Harlem funeral director has his hands 
full. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Edmund J. Cambridge and set in 1962, the production is the final 
play of a trilogy by Steve Carter ("Eden" and "Nevis Mountain Dew") exploring 
relationships between African and Caribbean Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The production is a promising send-off for the comfortable smaller theater in 
Crossroads' new home in the Leimert-Crenshaw district. 
</P>
<P>
At 4310 Degnan Blvd., Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 p.m., through

HOW KOREANS WATCHED THE MOVIES

<P>
"The Movieteller," a film/performance piece that revived a forgotten Korean 
movie-house tradition, contributed a playful and arcane note to cross-cultural 
collision during the closing weekend of the L.A. Festival. 
</P>
<P>
The technically ambitious multimedia production at the Inner City Cultural 
Center re-created the quaint old Korean pyonsa, a movieteller who would sit in 
the dark between the audience and the movie screen and interpret all the roles 
in foreign and silent films with his own fanciful dialogue, sarcasm and 
personal viewpoint that had nothing to do with the film. 
</P>
<P>
The primary movie inventively dramatized by director-writer-narrator Walter 
Lew, in a show that featured film collages, slides, a live traditional Korean 
dancer and cutout animation, was the 1948 William Powell-Ann Blyth fantasy, 
"Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid," precursor to "Splash." 
</P>
<P>
Lew (with major filmic contributions from Lewis Klahr) has a hypnotic voice 
that lulls you along a nominally lyrical, amusing path. But live theater takes 
a back seat. A big problem theatrically, with four screens hanging over the 
stage, is the sense of a silver-and-black void -- Lew sits in the dark and you 
never see him. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the Pacific Rim is widened a touch: This is how Koreans watched 
American movies before talkies and even after World War II, when dubbing costs 
were prohibitive.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE;

PAYING FOR TROOPS IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House voted 370 to 53 to require Japan to pay the $5-billion annual cost of 
stationing 50,000 U.S. troops and dependents there. This occurred during debate 
on the fiscal 1991 defense budget (HR 4739). About 5,000 of the Americans would 
be withdrawn annually if Japan declined to start paying for them. U.S. troops 
are based in Japan to protect it as well as American regional interests. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) complained that "American workers are paying 
to protect Japan while Japan closes its markets to us." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent David O'B. Martin (R-N.Y.) said the amendment sends Japan an 
appropriate message but "would be more detrimental to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to require Japan to begin paying for the American troops it 
hosts.

Troops in Korea 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 157 to 265, the House rejected an amendment to bring more troops 
home from South Korea than the White House wants returned as world tensions 
ease. The amendment to the 1991 defense bill (above) sought to reduce U.S. 
forces in South Korea from 43,000 to 30,000 in the next few years, compared 
with the 36,000- level sought by the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Robert J. Mrazek (D-N.Y.) said his amendment "would save us $3 billion 
over the next five years without affecting our deterrence capability." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) said: "North Korea has done nothing 
really to . . . change its dictatorial policies to warrant us lowering our 
guard." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to cap U.S. military strength in South Korea at 30,000.

Student Loan Forgiveness 
</P>
<P>
The House refused, 200 to 212, to kill student loan forgiveness for new 
borrowers who join the proposed "national service." This occurred as the House 
sent to conference with the Senate a bill (HR 4330) establishing the volunteer 
corps, which would place youths in community jobs such as conservation and drug 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment sought to kill language canceling all interest and some principal 
on loans that volunteers receive after the bill becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Thomas E. Petri (R-Wis.) said Congress should not relinquish to a 
private official, such as a YMCA director, the power to forgive student loans. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Pat Williams (D-Mont.) said Peace Corps and Vista volunteers receive 
the same benefit, so "let's extend it as part of these 'thousand points of 
light' to other young Americans." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to eliminate loan forgiveness for national service volunteers.

TAILBACK INJURIES LEAVE CANYON WITH FEW OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canyon High is in the market for a healthy tailback. David McDivitt, third 
among area players in rushing, missed last week's game and is expected to miss 
four more weeks because of a hematoma in his thigh resulting from a deep bruise 
suffered on the first play of the Cowboys' win over Hart on Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Safety Mark Santos was moved to tailback against Notre Dame and rushed for 105 
yards and one touchdown in 20 carries. Unfortunately for the Cowboys, he 
sustained a dislocated shoulder in the first quarter. Santos reentered the game 
and played until the fourth quarter, when he again hurt the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
So, who is next? Coach Harry Welch was considering using fullback Mike Torres 
until Torres suffered a sprained ankle Monday in practice. Welch is reluctant 
to put defensive starters Jason Brenner and Scott Blade in the backfield and 
disrupt the chemistry of one of the area's top defenses. And with nemesis 
Thousand Oaks visiting Canyon Friday night, the Cowboys appear to be in a bind. 
</P>
<P>
With few options, Welch believes that Santos, healthy or no, will strap on the 
helmet and give it a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Said Welch: "He's as tough as God makes them." 
</P>
<P>
Add injured tailbacks: Channel Islands' Renard Carn suffered a stress fracture 
in an ankle Friday in the Raiders' 30-19 win over Hueneme and will be sidelined 
for five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Carn, a 6-foot, 185-pound senior, rushed for 197 yards in Channel Islands' 
opener. He had 47 yards in seven carries before leaving Friday's game in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Second-string running back Jason Bell will take Carn's place in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Spread the wealth: St. Francis used 11 different rushers in its 27-0 win over 
St. Bernard on Friday and has used 13 in two games. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to spread it around," St. Francis Coach Bill Garrison said. "It's 
running back by committee. We look at it from the production standpoint and we 
just can't get the same output from one kid." 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the equal-opportunity approach has returned dividends. 
</P>
<P>
St Francis (2-0) has outscored its opponents, 55-0, and has doubled its win 
total from last season when the Golden Knights finished 1-9. 
</P>
<P>
Bronner's boots: Hoover's David Bronner, who also plays on the school's soccer 
and baseball teams, booted field goals of 39 yards and a lifetime-best 44 
yards, kicked an extra point and caught a touchdown pass to help lift the 
Tornadoes to a 21-20 victory over South Pasadena on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Bronner, an All-Foothill League punter last season, also kicked a 43-yard field 
goal and three extra points in Hoover's win over Crescenta Valley the previous 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Latest Swinton: Montclair Prep, at a loss in its backfield since the transfer 
of Derek Sparks, turned to a familiar name for its game against Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The talented Swinton family, which sent current Washington State player Riche 
and brother Jamal to Montclair Prep, has another member carrying on the 
tradition: sophomore Eliel Swinton. 
</P>
<P>
Swinton, 5-foot-10, 185 pounds, rushed for 252 yards against Simi Valley and 
might be the answer to the question mark in Montclair Prep's backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offense certainly features a tailback," Coach George Giannini said. "For a 
sophomore, he's got great downfield instincts." 
</P>
<P>
Giannini, aware of the family ties, believes that Eliel has a lot of potential. 
"He'll probably turn out to be the best Swinton I've coached," Giannini said. 
</P>
<P>
Shake-up: After a 38-13 loss to Muir, Palmdale shook up its lineup and rode the 
change to a 35-0 win over Chaminade last Friday. Coach Kent Bothwell moved 
quarterback Rodney Williams to flanker and defensive back and inserted junior 
Jay Mapson at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Bothwell said that the move to Mapson was made because Mapson "will do things 
the way coaches want him to do it and the way coaches teach him to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, though, is not in the doghouse: He will return kicks and punts as 
well as start two ways. 
</P>
<P>
Solace in history: With a 14-3 loss to Crespi last week, Hart has dropped its 
first two games. However, Coach Mike Herrington is not too worried. Hart 
started 0-3-1 in 1985 but went on to win the Foothill League title and advance 
to the Coastal Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't make predictions," Herrington said. "(After a bad start), you never 
know what's going to happen. (The loss to Crespi) has got our kids fired up."

SHRINKING: The number of people living outside cities in Orange County, above, 
could be halved within a year or so. . . . Incorporation efforts are well under 
way in El Toro and Laguna Hills, and the first steps are being taken in North 
Tustin. . . . Together the three areas have a population of 110,000. If they 
incorporate, about 95% of all county residents would be living within 32 
cities.

MARRIED ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS STILL YEARN TO SERVE THEIR CHURCH. THEY SEEK AN 
END TO MANDATORY CELIBACY AS THE CHURCH FACES A CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF ACTIVE 
CLERGYMEN.

<TEXT>
<P>
They have acquired new loves along the way in wives and children. But an old 
love still burns in the hearts of many married Roman Catholic priests -- the 
desire to serve their church as ordained ministers. 
</P>
<P>
That is officially forbidden and only the Pope can change it. Many of the 
estimated 19,000 U.S. Catholic priests who have married in the past 20 years 
remain loyal, believing that they can function both as married men and 
effective ministers of the sacraments. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, their church is being hurt by a clergy shortage that grows steadily 
worse each year: 43% of the world's parishes -- and about one-tenth of the 
19,500 U.S. parishes -- do not have a regular priest. In the United States, 
according to studies, half of the priests under age 60 have married, and by the 
mid-1990s, the number of married priests is expected to equal or surpass the 
26,000 unmarried active parish priests. 
</P>
<P>
So, when several hundred married priests and their spouses held an annual 
meeting here recently, it was not surprising that they gently confronted the 
nation's Catholic bishops -- who by chance were attending their own retreat at 
nearby Santa Clara University. At a prayer vigil, and later with four bishops 
officially selected to meet with them, leaders of Corpus, the National Assn. 
for a Married Priesthood, pressed for the return of married priests to full 
sacramental service and an end to mandatory celibacy. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are ready for a married priesthood," said Philip McGovern, a 
married priest living in Placentia and a West Coast representative of Corpus. 
"They are not dumb, not sheep as the church has treated them. They don't care 
if a priest is married or not, as long as they are fed with the Gospel and the 
Eucharist." 
</P>
<P>
A social gathering for married priests, held in Buena Park last Saturday, drew 
73 of an estimated 750 married priests from Los Angeles to San Diego, including 
Matthias Ryder, who stepped down as pastor of St. Callistus Church in Garden 
Grove this summer to get married, McGovern said. 
</P>
<P>
McGovern predicted the grass-roots movement for a married priesthood will 
succeed this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Although priestly celibacy is not on the agenda of a worldwide bishops 
conference in Rome next month, Brazilian and Canadian bishops have said that 
they will recommend that married men not previously ordained be eligible for 
priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
Even officials at the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington admit to an 
uncertainty about what to call the priests: resigned, inactive, or married. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 4th Century, the Roman Catholic Church has decreed that its priests 
must be celibate, basing the requirement on the assumption that Jesus was 
unmarried, upon the words of Apostle Paul that "an unmarried man can devote 
himself (fully) to the Lord's affairs" (1 Corinthians 7:32), and upon church 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Some priests seek "laicization," an often lengthy process whereby the Vatican 
releases a man from the priesthood and grants him full standing as a lay 
Catholic. Others skip the formalities. 
</P>
<P>
Priests who marry find it is not always easy to deal with the guilt that 
lingers after having forsaken the vow of celibacy, or to change careers and 
take on family responsibilities at midlife. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Buko, a former Maryknoll missionary priest to Japan, said the toughest 
adjustments he faced when he resigned 22 years ago and married were retooling 
for another career and learning to be a family man. 
</P>
<P>
"I went back to Fordham and got a degree in social work," he said. "I had a 
theology degree but that won't buy you any groceries. And getting used to kids 
again was difficult. I hadn't seen a child for all those days I was in 
seminary, so I got a job as a trainee at a foster-care agency." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he and his wife, Ann, have four daughters. He works for the San Diego 
County Adoption Services. She is campus nurse at the University of San Diego 
and a consultant on sex education for the local diocese. 
</P>
<P>
The Bukos are typical of couples who adjust well. Most married priests, who 
tend to be high achievers, are healthy, well-rounded persons, according to 
Terence Dosh, a former Benedictine monk who is national coordinator of 
Minneapolis-based Corpus. Most land on their feet financially. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-nine percent of the men who left (in the late 1960s and early 1970s) 
were successful in making a good living -- sometimes to the amazement and 
disappointment of those who stayed," said Tom McMahon, a licensed family 
counselor who leads a weekly Eucharistic meeting in San Jose for a group of 
about 15 families. Younger priests, he added, typically have acquired degrees 
or skills that make it easier to find employment when they leave. 
</P>
<P>
Some married priests never quite make the transition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still very painful," confided one resigned priest who asked that his name 
not be used. "We'll never get rid of the fact that we're priests . . . I'm 
recovering from realizing they'll never let me return to the priesthood just 
because I'm married." 
</P>
<P>
At least 5,000 married priests would like to serve their church in an ordained 
capacity, according to Dosh. About 30 to 40 of the nation's 188 dioceses permit 
married priests to function in church jobs, he said, although they cannot 
administer the sacraments. Another 80 to 100 married priests teach theology at 
the university level -- half of them at Catholic schools. 
</P>
<P>
About 60% of those doing secular work are in social service professions; most 
of the rest are in a variety of businesses, according to a survey of 5,500 
married priests made by Corpus. 
</P>
<P>
For example, social worker James Mulligan counsels on legal, financial and 
family matters during the week in his job for the state of California and 
assists a Sacramento parish priest on Sundays. John Ilg of Portland runs his 
own rug- and upholstery-cleaning business. Nick De Los Reyes, who brought his 
wife and four young children to a recent conference of several hundred Corpus 
members, is a clinical psychologist in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Priests who attended the conference at San Jose State University said celibacy 
was what drove most of them to resign. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens," said Buko, who led a workshop at the conference on how to cope 
with resigning from the priesthood, "is they meet a woman who is loving and 
sensitive, and they fall in love and that changes everything . . . Women teach 
us about intimacy -- the opposite of clerical control and power." 
</P>
<P>
Corpus, he added, "is enormous help as a mutual support system . . . It's a 
kind of Priests Anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
With some exasperation, the married priests noted that since 1982 the Vatican 
has permitted dozens of married Episcopal priests and several Lutherans to 
convert to Roman Catholicism, remain married and celebrate Mass, hear 
confessions and perform other priestly duties. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a double standard," said Guy Murning of Mill Valley, who was ordained a 
Catholic priest in 1970, but left to marry eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Zaire and Indonesia, according to Dosh, married priests are clandestinely 
serving because of specialized tribal needs and a priest shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking last month at the International Federation of Married Catholic Priests 
in the Netherlands, Anthony T. Padovano, president of Corpus, declared that 
"obligatory celibacy is the church's Berlin Wall, its Eastern Europe under 
Soviet domination, its Stalinist and Brezhnev era before Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
On this issue, said Padovano, who presided at the San Jose meeting and spoke to 
a West Coast meeting of married priests in Buena Park last Saturday, Pope John 
Paul II "presents the image of an avenger, a Grand Inquisitor who holds married 
priests under house arrest until they recant by denying their marriages and 
their choices." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony does not think optional celibacy would 
help the church in the long run because Eastern rite Catholic churches, which 
permit married clergy, also have a priest shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Opinions differ over whether a married priesthood would decrease the mounting 
reports of sexual misconduct by Catholic clergy. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, priests are vulnerable from the inside because of their own sexual 
drives and from the outside because they become very attractive sexual 
targets," said A. W. Richard Sipe, a former Benedictine monk who is married and 
practices psychotherapy in Baltimore. He will publish a 25-year study next 
month based on 1,000 interviews with priests and 500 of their intimates, 
concluding that half of all priests break celibacy vows. 
</P>
<P>
Sipe's findings come as surveys indicate a rising majority of U.S. priests and 
laity favor "optional celibacy" for priests who choose it. 
</P>
<P>
While a number of married priests are seeking to refocus their sexuality, 
others are working their way through feelings that they let the church down 
when they were sorely needed. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of priests, said Paul Dion, who served under Bishop Leo T. Maher of San 
Diego before marrying in 1977, "have had to work through many layers of guilt . 
. . inculcated from their youth and the family values of being Roman Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
Part of it, he said, is feeling that, "I made a promise, a vow to God, and I 
haven't been faithful to that vow, so now in my human weakness I have turned my 
back on him." 
</P>
<P>
Priests who resign may also feel bad about letting down their parishioners or 
the missionary society or seminary that trained them. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through some of these things myself," said Dion, "and still have to go 
through them." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon, who grew up in a staunch Irish Catholic family in San Francisco and 
served as a priest for 26 years, insists that he "never resigned." He was 
ordered out of his parish in 1980, when the bishop learned that he had been 
quietly married for five years and had two children. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I would be cut off completely -- pension, health benefits and work in 
the line I was trained in and accustomed to for over 38 years. I spent four 
years in therapy getting ready for the change and delighted I did," he said.

O.C. TO PUT UP $10 MILLION FOR LAGUNA LAUREL LAND 
</P>

<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to ante up $10 million 
over the next five years toward the rescue of one of the last undeveloped 
coastal canyon areas in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The money represents only part of the anticipated purchase price for the 
environmentally sensitive Laguna Laurel area of Laguna Canyon -- 2,150 acres of 
picturesque hillsides and gullies north of downtown Laguna Beach along Laguna 
Canyon Road. The land is valued at $80 million to $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach officials and environmentalists praised the board's action, 
calling it an important strategic victory in one of the county's longest and 
most bitter development battles, against the Irvine Co.'s proposed 3,200-home 
Laguna Laurel project. 
</P>
<P>
To keep purchase hopes alive, Laguna Beach residents must now approve a 
$20-million bond issue in November. City officials are confident it will pass, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
"This contribution and this support on the part of the county takes our project 
out of the realm of a dream and makes it possible from our point of view," said 
an elated Laguna Beach Mayor Lida Lenney. "The county's contribution will make 
this a real solid goal." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last five years, the Laguna Laurel development project has been 
vigorously opposed by environmentalists and officials who want to keep the 
land, which borders Laguna Beach. Last fall, a protest march against the 
development drew 7,000 Southern California residents. 
</P>
<P>
But development seemed a foregone conclusion until earlier this year, when the 
company suddenly announced that it was willing to sell the land to the public. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, county officials, company executives and environmentalists are 
scheduled to meet privately Thursday to begin negotiating a firm price in the 
hopes of setting the land aside as permanent wilderness park. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes Laguna Beach, 
presented the county contribution plan that was unanimously approved by fellow 
board members Tuesday. The board agreed in principal to spend $10 million 
toward purchase of Laguna Laurel -- to be paid in installments over the next 
five years -- and instructed the county staff to come back in 30 days with a 
schedule for shifting money from other park programs, primarily in Riley's 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said Tuesday's vote should quiet critics who have complained that county 
officials have not done enough to help save the land. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some people have felt the county effort was not in their best 
interest," Riley said. But, he continued, "we're talking about an area we've 
always had an interest in." 
</P>
<P>
The board's vote came at a critical time for city officials and 
environmentalists struggling to preserve the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, an independent appraiser hired by the Irvine Co. is expected to 
privately submit findings on the precise value of the land to the Laguna Laurel 
Advisory Committee, a team of negotiators representing the company, the county, 
Laguna Beach and a coalition of environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm expecting a busy weekend of people talking to each other," Laguna 
Greenbelt President Elisabeth Brown said. "I hope we can reach (an agreement) 
by early next week." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth cautioned, however, that the board's vote Tuesday is 
only one step toward a resolution that is "contingent on a lot of things 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, the company and Laguna Beach must agree on a purchase 
price. City officials have said previously that they will pay no more than $50 
million for the property, roughly half the county's informal estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the asking price, Laguna Beach residents will have to approve the bond 
issue on the Nov. 6 ballot in order for the purchase to have any chance of 
becoming reality. The measure must pass by a two-thirds vote. In a poll 
released in July, nearly three-fourths of the respondents said they would 
support the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach is also expected to draw about $5 million from state grant funds 
available through Proposition 70, the wildlife, coastal and parkland 
conservation program. The Irvine Co., which has agreed to let the city buy the 
land in installments over 10 years, has also promised to contribute the final 
$10 million of the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
How the balance of the money could be raised would depend in part on the final 
price: Laguna officials say that if the price is low enough they might be able 
to raise the difference through private contributions. If the price is too 
high, however, the whole deal could fall through, the officials warn. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot depends on (Irvine Co. chief executive officer) Donald Bren. He's the 
one who owns the property and will set the price. We know he's a very shrewd 
businessman," Lenney said. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Irvine Co. executives said Tuesday that the appraisal to be 
submitted Thursday will be a serious starting point for a "workable" purchase 
plan. Company officials declined to comment on specifics of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"With that accomplished this week," Irvine Co. Vice President Larry Thomas 
said, "it's our hope and the hope of everyone that there can be agreement upon 
such a plan."

SANTA ANA FREEWAY JOB LEAVES REST IN SLOW LANE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: HUGE WIDENING PROJECT WILL USE UP NEARLY EVERY DOLLAR OF COUNTY 
HIGHWAY FUNDING FOR DECADES, REPORT WARNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The $1.6-billion project to widen the Santa Ana Freeway is a black hole that 
will swallow up almost every dollar in state and federal highway money likely 
to flow to Orange County for the next two decades, according to a new state 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Just to complete an 8-mile stretch of the freeway through Anaheim "would 
require full commitment for 15 to 20 years . . . of all resources that could 
reasonably be expected for Orange County," the state analysis concludes. 
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared for the California Transportation Commission in advance 
of its vote today on how to allocate state highway funds for the next seven 
years. Orange County is expected to receive $485 million, with about $365 
million earmarked for the Santa Ana Freeway project. Of that, $156 million will 
cover just the cost overruns experienced so far. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-year funding plan can be adjusted in two years, and local officials 
are debating behind the scenes whether Interstate 5 should retain such a high 
funding priority because other freeway improvement projects in the county are 
suffering as a result. 
</P>
<P>
The debate is expected to intensify if a proposed half-cent sales tax for 
transportation projects is defeated on Nov. 6. The proposal, known as Measure 
M, would raise $2.1 billion, including $550 million for Santa Ana Freeway work. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been telling people for years that I-5 is a sponge that soaks up 
everything," Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County 
Transportation Commission, said Tuesday. "But it's not as if you're pouring 
money into nothing. There are tangible benefits being produced. . . . But sure, 
if everything goes haywire (if Measure M fails), then we will have to 
re-evaluate our priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Widening the interstate from six to 12 lanes between the El Toro Y in Irvine 
and the San Gabriel River Freeway -- Interstate 605 -- in Los Angeles County 
has been Orange County's top funding priority for 10 years. Oftelie defended 
that fact by describing the freeway as the county's "Main Street" of industry 
and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it was the one big project that all segments of the county could agree 
on, he said. Commitments were made years ago to such cities as Anaheim and 
Santa Ana and such companies as Disneyland and the Irvine Co. to keep it at the 
top of the list. "We have to honor our commitments," Oftelie said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the county requested $465 million from the state for the project, 
but the California Transportation Commission's staff is recommending $365 
million. Another $33 million is recommended for installation of car-pool lanes 
on the Riverside Freeway and $5 million for the San Joaquin Hills tollway, with 
the rest of the county's allocation split among smaller projects such as the 
widening of Pacific Coast Highway and Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Adding capacity to (the Santa Ana Freeway) continues to be the top priority in 
Orange County," according to the Caltrans staff report, "as it has for the past 
10 years and probably will be for the next 20. The Santa Ana Freeway has as bad 
a congestion problem as any freeway in the state. . . . But costs have 
consistently outrun programming." 
</P>
<P>
For example, the cost of widening the segment between Irvine and Santa Ana has 
more than doubled since 1988, Caltrans estimates, from $170 million to $350 
million. Moreover, land costs have escalated so rapidly that most of the state 
funding expected for Orange County could be used for right-of-way purchases 
during the next decade, with little or no money left over for concrete. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some people question the wisdom of pouring all of the county's 
highway resources into one project. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Orange County Transportation Commission, the state is 
already diverting $40 million from the project to help pay for the car-pool 
lanes on the Riverside Freeway. However, county officials hope that much of 
this money will eventually revert to the Santa Ana Freeway because a private 
consortium plans to build the extra lanes on the Riverside Freeway and recoup 
its costs through tolls. 
</P>
<P>
The state Transportation Commission report said Orange County will need to 
supply local funds to complete both the land purchases and construction for the 
widening project, a statement sure to fuel the campaign rhetoric in favor of 
Measure M. A nearly identical measure was defeated a year ago, and a recent 
public opinion survey by The Times Orange County Poll showed that support has 
deteriorated badly in recent months, worrying transportation officials. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nestande, a member of the California Transportation Commission and 
supporter of Measure M, said that without passage of the ballot proposal, "you 
look at the numbers (of dollars) on the I-5 project and you've got to ask 
yourself what it's getting you, and whether you should be pouring money into 
right of way (purchases) for the next 15 years or diverting some money to 
protect our investment in other roads." 
</P>
<P>
But officials in Anaheim and other cities along the freeway are resistant to 
stalling the widening in favor of such improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear rumblings about changing the priorities," said Anaheim Councilman Irv 
Pickler, a member of the County Transportation Commission. "But as far as I'm 
concerned, I-5 is the key. It's not going to get any cheaper. We just can't put 
it on the back burner.

CHASE REIGNITES CALL FOR NEW CHECKPOINT; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: A FLEEING PICKUP CARRYING SUSPECTED ILLEGAL ALIENS CAUSES A 
FIVE-INJURY CRASH AT A SAN CLEMENTE INTERSECTION.

<P>
Local politicians, angered by a Border Patrol chase that resulted in a 
two-vehicle collision on a busy commercial street Tuesday, renewed their call 
for relocation of the controversial north San Diego County immigration 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Five people suffered mostly minor injuries when a pickup carrying suspected 
illegal aliens bolted from the checkpoint and led authorities on a 10-minute 
chase that ended when the truck rammed a car driven by a San Juan Capistrano 
mother taking her 7-year-old son to school. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any question about the need for a new checkpoint," said 
Mike Eggers, a Dana Point city councilman and chief Orange County aide to U.S. 
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who has sponsored a bill to build a checkpoint 
five miles south of the current one. "It's tragic you have to have these kinds 
of incidents to bring this issue to the forefront." 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente officials also voiced frustration over repeated Border Patrol 
chases on city streets or the San Diego Freeway, which runs up the spine of the 
rolling beach community. 
</P>
<P>
"I said all along that this was a time bomb" waiting to explode, Councilman 
Brian J. Rice said. "I got my phone ringing off the hook. This has always been 
my greatest fear. There is no justification for the (chase)." 
</P>
<P>
But immigration officials defended the manner in which the chase was carried 
out, saying Border Patrol agents and local police responded with caution and 
attempted not to create a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Swofford, an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman, said there 
is little that checkpoint officers, who try to wave vehicles to a stop, can do 
to curb the rising number of cars that race away. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford said that in the past year the INS has been involved in 187 chases of 
suspected illegal aliens who have fled during routine stops at the San Clemente 
checkpoint. Four or five of those chases have resulted in injuries, none of 
them fatal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very problematic," Swofford said. "It has always occurred to some 
degree. But it seems to be getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the chase unfolded about 8:20 a.m. Tuesday morning when a 
stolen 1984 Isuzu pickup truck driven by Cisco I. Hernandez, 18, a Mexican 
national, ignored an order to stop at the manned checkpoint, located on 
Interstate 5 about five miles south of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
After leading authorities up the freeway and onto San Clemente streets, the 
truck collided with a car driven by Linda Delaine Chaffee, 42, at the 
intersection of El Camino Real and Avenida de la Grulla in northern San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the truck was headed north on El Camino Real when it pulled 
around a line of cars and headed up the southbound lane. The truck smashed into 
the driver's side of Chaffee's car as she made a left turn out of the 
northbound lane. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee suffered an eye injury and was treated at Samaritan Medical Center-San 
Clemente and released. She was taking her son, Drew, to nearby Las Palmas 
Elementary School when the accident occurred. The boy and his younger brother, 
who was also in the car, were not injured, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez also escaped injury, but four occupants of the truck, all of them 
believed to be illegal immigrants, were treated for minor injuries at the 
hospital. They were identified only as two men, a woman and a 2-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the truck had been stolen in Chula Vista, near San Diego. 
Hernandez faces federal charges of fleeing from a Border Patrol officer and 
entering the country illegally, Swofford said. He also faces state charges of 
reckless driving and auto theft, San Clemente Police Sgt. Richard Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee's husband joined local officials in questioning the effectiveness of 
the checkpoint. He also criticized the INS for conducting a chase during the 
morning, when hundreds of children are walking to school. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe the irresponsibility of the INS," said David Chaffee, a tax 
and environmental attorney for Orange County. "To jeopardize the lives of my 
family and their officers is just ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it really worth it to apprehend these, quote, 'dangerous criminals' to 
jeopardize . . . children?" 
</P>
<P>
But immigration officials said David Chaffee was aiming his blame in the wrong 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand (Chaffee's) upset and frustrated," Swofford said. "But we are not 
the ones who stole a truck, ran red lights and drove in a reckless manner to 
get away. The blame is misdirected." 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Mayor Candace Haggard, who on Monday mailed a letter to various 
legislators urging them not to cut funding for a new checkpoint during budget 
deliberations, agreed that the pursuit should not have taken place on city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel sick for the poor innocent victims, and quite frankly I feel bad 
for the INS agents," Haggard said. Although she opposes Border Patrol chases in 
the city, Haggard said the agents were "just doing their job." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to build a $30-million checkpoint 5 miles south of the current site 
were prompted by a Dec. 21, 1986, crash in downtown San Clemente in which a 
carload of suspected illegal immigrants was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The INS has designed a 16-lane checkpoint that authorities contend would make 
it virtually impossible for those passing through to bolt from agents.

"Hard work, low pay, miserable conditions . . . and more!" 
</P>
<P>
To Placentia residents Paul Hathaway and Christian Kirk, it sounded too good to 
pass up. Last month, the pair joined a new program offered by the California 
Conservation Corps to train young firefighters, the first of its kind in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a job for the timid. 
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost, the CCC is a work-ethic program. It's not a summer camp or 
vacation," reads the work agreement that all recruits must sign. "You'll do 
dirty, backbreaking work, and have few people to thank you for it." 
</P>
<P>
Now for minimum wage, Hathaway and Kirk work grueling, 10-hour days beginning 
at 6 a.m. Still, they say, it beats any other job. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people would rather work at Mervyn's all day, but I'd rather be out doing 
something physical," Hathaway, 20, said. "I've always been interested in 
conservation, and when I found out the job was fighting fires, I thought that 
was pretty exciting." 
</P>
<P>
The Conservation Corps opened its first Orange County office in Yorba Linda on 
Aug. 1 and began recruiting. The County Fire Department loaned the office space 
and equipment, and it also helps to train the fire crews. In return, the corps 
provides manpower to fight blazes and help in other emergencies, said Scot 
Schmier, the corps' coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a win-win situation. The county benefits. The corps benefits" and the 
trainees gain real firefighting experience, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen men now are training for front-line firefighting. A second group of 10 
will soon begin training as a support crew. 
</P>
<P>
Their days typically begin before sunrise. At a remote Silverado Canyon site 
called Hangman's Tree, Fire Department instructor Bob Feldtz recently took nine 
trainees on a mountain hike in 90-degree heat to acclimate them to the terrain 
and weather they will face. 
</P>
<P>
On their first afternoon wearing full gear -- heavy yellow coats and pants, 
hiking boots, helmets and goggles -- the crew warmed up with a brisk climb up a 
rocky hill. Then they cut access trails, called "scratch lines," through the 
brush with shovels and axes. After only 10 minutes, they had cleared a path 125 
feet long and two feet wide, and sweat had darkened the outermost layers of 
their protective clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about 150 degrees inside this, and it's not even a hot day. This ain't 
nothing to what a fire's going to be," Kirk said. 
</P>
<P>
David Seminario of Fullerton, who at 18 is the youngest member of the crew, 
said, "It's like being in a microwave oven in here." 
</P>
<P>
But Schmier suggested that they get used to it. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys are doing good -- only 11 hours and 45 minutes more until you're 
done," Schmier called out. His message was serious: They must be prepared for 
work on a real fire. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Feldtz called out, "Air drop, hit the deck!" to practice reacting to 
a water drop on a nearby blaze. The crew dove spread-eagled onto the trail as 
they would during such a drop to avoid being knocked down by the torrent. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1976, the Conservation Corps has employed more than 45,000 young 
adults. Firefighting is only part of the corps' work. Its members also build 
roads, clean parks and help restore wildlife areas. In the future, Schmier 
said, the corps also will be working with cities as well as the county. 
</P>
<P>
Corps' spokeswoman Susanne Levitsky said the new program's chief advantage is 
that it uses local residents and lets them work close to home. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pride when you're working in your area or city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The county Fire Department also uses the work of state and county inmates from 
juvenile and adult institutions to fight fires, said Chip Prather, assistant 
chief of operations for the department. That, however, is a separate operation 
from the corps. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservation Corps program can train 25 men and women aged 18 to 23. And 
although women make up 20% of the 1,800 corps members statewide and are 
encouraged to join the firefighting program, none has yet done so, Schmier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Feldtz said the crew's determination shows. 
</P>
<P>
"I've only had them for four days, but they're really motivated. They really 
want to be firefighters. Anyone can work at McDonald's for $5 an hour. But you 
ain't gonna get up at 5 in the morning to work at McDonald's. This shows 
they're really motivated to help California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk, 21, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"The pay doesn't mean anything to me. All my relatives think it's just great. 
It makes me happy to know I'm doing something to make them proud," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before now, Hathaway said, "I was working at a gas station and hating it. I 
feel better, more at peace with myself, working for a company that's doing 
something good."

DANA PARSONS: FEINSTEIN'S 'STAR POWER' DIMMED BY MARTYRDOM CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have a gut feeling that Dianne Feinstein will be elected governor. It's 
nothing I'd bet the retirement pension on, but I sense a vague unease "out 
there" among the masses and the accompanying feeling that the good ol' boys 
just aren't getting the job done. 
</P>
<P>
Her campaign approach so far strikes a chord like the one John F. Kennedy 
played in 1960, following eight years under that lovable helmsman, Dwight D. 
Eisenhower -- namely, that the ship of state is taking on water. 
</P>
<P>
But to assure the public that he wasn't a loose cannon disguised as a dynamo, 
Kennedy said just enough conservative things about military preparedness to 
keep people from getting too jittery. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend in Anaheim, Feinstein sounded like she'd read all the JFK primers. 
She talked about the state's "crumbling" infrastructures, both human and 
physical, and of being moved when she saw an "I Will Work for Food" street 
beggar within hailing distance of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
She ticked off a full Democratic social agenda, mentioning child care, AIDS, 
help for the elderly, health insurance, abortion rights, education and the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
But she also took the "tough" issue of crime and threw it right where it 
belongs -- in the faces of the demagogic Republicans who have been waving it 
around for years. "Is there anyone who feels safer today than you did eight 
years ago?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If you sell drugs, you should go to jail," she said. "If you take another's 
life, you should forfeit your own." Her death penalty position didn't elicit 
enthusiasm from the Democratic crowd, but it will play well in more 
middle-of-the-road or conservative households. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, Feinstein's luncheon talk was an effective message that jazzed up a 
room of Orange County Democrats, which, believe me, is no mean feat. 
</P>
<P>
I remember sitting in the midst of a Democratic gathering in Santa Ana in June, 
1988, while a small group of party faithful watched on television as Michael S. 
Dukakis stepped to the microphone after winning the California presidential 
primary. Even with local TV cameras pointing at the local Democrats, it took 
nothing short of a mass goosing to get them to stand up and put on a feigned 
show of enthusiasm for Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein had no such problem last weekend. Her "star power" looks like the 
genuine article and may make the difference with that broad middle ground of 
the California electorate that will probably decide who the next governor will 
be. 
</P>
<P>
And now for the bad news. Just about the time you think a candidate may rise 
above the crowd, they do something to show they're human. 
</P>
<P>
That was Feinstein during a post-luncheon press conference, responding to a 
question about her husband's unloading of stock in 1989 just hours before the 
company's president quit and the stock value dropped like a B-52 out of gas. 
Her husband, Richard Blum, is a director and a major shareholder in the 
company, Irvine's National Education Corp.; he sold 115,000 shares on behalf of 
the investment group he controls. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that Blum and his partners made a bundle. Blum acknowledged 
over the weekend that the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned him 
about the stock sale, presumably about whether insider trading information 
contributed to his decision to sell. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC has announced no action. That's where things stand today. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances of the sale make it a legitimate campaign issue, considering 
that Blum isn't just Feinstein's husband, but also her campaign's chief 
financial backer. 
</P>
<P>
In first responding to a reporter's question, Feinstein said about all you'd 
expect her to say -- that the SEC had taken a look at things and that she 
assumed everything was fine. 
</P>
<P>
Would that she would have stopped there. Instead, she decided to martyr 
herself, saying that: "I recognize what's happening here. And what's happening 
is using him to get at me. And somehow, I guess in a true sense of what's right 
and what's wrong, that strikes me as wrong." 
</P>
<P>
She recounted her career as a public servant and her pride in "my integrity and 
my credibility." 
</P>
<P>
She concluded by saying, "I've seen this done with other women candidates, too. 
And I'm not making conclusions. But I think it offers substantial food for 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
I agree, and my conclusions are that Feinstein blew it on that one. She's not 
being picked on because she's a woman; she was legitimately questioned because 
she's running for governor and her closest personal adviser and financial 
contributor did something that raised enough questions for the SEC to look into 
it. 
</P>
<P>
It's true she's subjected to what seems like a double standard but only because 
women historically haven't attained the kind of lofty political perch she 
occupies. And male candidates historically haven't been subjected to that kind 
of spousal scrutiny for the obvious reasons that their spouses typically 
weren't as visible as male spouses are today. 
</P>
<P>
If Feinstein thinks that only women's spouses get picked on, she should ask 
former state Sen. William Campbell about news stories regarding his wife's 
involvement in a women's conference in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The rules are changing, and Feinstein knows it. To play the role of the 
would-be martyr isn't becoming of the next governor of California. 
</P>
<P>
Caesar's wife had to be above suspicion. It's only right that when Caesar's 
wife runs for office, so, too, should her husband.

ST. JOHN'S SCHOOL DEDICATES BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. John's School, at 30382 Via con Dios, dedicated its first permanent 
building Tuesday, a $1.2-million structure built entirely from donations. 
</P>
<P>
The private, Episcopalian elementary school has housed 550 students in portable 
buildings since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But during the past year, officials from the Episcopal Diocese, the Rancho 
Santa Margarita Co. and the Hunsaker Development Co. raised the money to build 
rooms for preschool, kindergarten and administration offices at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Officials will now campaign to raise $1.5 million to build 24 
first-through-eighth-grade classrooms, school spokesman Stephen Nill said, 
adding that church leaders hope to have the school completed within a year. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's School was founded by retired priest Ernest Sillers, the 80-year-old 
founder of St. Margaret's Episcopal School in San Juan Capistrano.

4 IN LODGE CHARGED IN GAMBLING CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three officers and a bartender in the Moose lodge here were charged with 
misdemeanor gambling offenses Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
James Martin McAndrew, secretary of the Loyal Order of the Moose Lodge No. 
1832, and Ronald Ray Bixler, a former governor of the lodge, were each charged 
with six misdemeanor counts of bookmaking and related gambling offenses, 
according to court records filed in Westminster by the Orange County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Schloub, the present governor of the lodge, was charged with three 
misdemeanors, including setting up a lottery. Police reports allege that 
Schloub sold an undercover detective a $100 ticket for a Super Bowl lottery and 
accepted a $30 down payment from the detective in March. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged with four misdemeanor offenses was Betty Lou Edmondson, a 
bartender who is suspected of paying customers who hit the jackpot playing 
video poker, police reports show. 
</P>
<P>
McAndrew said he was not aware that he had been charged, and referred a request 
for comment to his attorney, who was unavailable Tuesday evening. Schloub, 
reached at the Moose lodge, declined comment. Bixler and Edmondson could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
The charges are the result of a two-year undercover investigation by city 
police. Officers raided the lodge on Sept. 7 and seized slot machines, poker 
machines, bookmaking documents, lottery records and $7,000 in cash. SONNI EFRON

SPECIAL STUDENTS GET CAREER ADVICE

<TEXT>
<P>
Even though school has just started, about 200 seniors from the Anaheim Union 
High School District spent Tuesday thinking where they were headed once the 
year ends. 
</P>
<P>
Those students were participating in the district's annual career day, and 
their choice of careers or educational plans for next year was even more 
difficult than it will be for some of their peers: All of the youngsters 
participating in the event Tuesday have some sort of disability. 
</P>
<P>
Those disabilities include physical and developmental handicaps as well as 
learning problems such as dyslexia and poor reading comprehension, officials 
said. For all of the students, their disabilities make planning for the future 
more challenging. 
</P>
<P>
"We really feel the need to bridge the gap" between high school and the working 
world, said Cheryl Escoe, career specialist for the district and organizer of 
the half-day conference. Counselors supervised sessions at Brookhurst Community 
Center in retail sales, recreation services, advertising and a host of other 
fields. Other seminars touched on a range of topics, providing advice on 
preparing for a job interview, applying to a community college and responding 
to harassment at work. 
</P>
<P>
And some of the job opportunities were novel ones. 
</P>
<P>
"How many of you know what a bone picker is?" asked Stan Corella, a 
job-placement specialist at the North Orange County Regional Occupational 
Program. "A bone picker is someone who picks the bones out of tuna so you don't 
get bones in your tuna fish." 
</P>
<P>
Students said they walked away from the conference with some new information 
and some uplifting advice, much of that provided by the event's first speaker, 
former football star and actor Rosey Grier. 
</P>
<P>
"He was encouraging," said Denise Evans, 16, who said she must battle her 
extreme shyness as she looks for work. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned about communication," she said. "I want to get over this shyness." 
</P>
<P>
Niki Amendola, 17, who is a slow learner in math, said the most interesting 
part of the workshop for her was the discussion about harassment in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I know there are places I can turn to, if you have been sexually harassed 
at work; there are numbers I can call," said Niki, who hopes to get a job 
working with animals after graduating in June. 
</P>
<P>
But even more important than some of the specifics, teachers said, was the 
event's overall message. Jack Zisko, work-experience coordinator at a special 
education school for the severely handicapped, reminded the students that the 
future is theirs to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't depend on your mothers or fathers or guardians to do this," he said. 
"If you're going to be responsible on the job, you have to be responsible for 
getting the job."LISA MASCARO

SUSPECTS CAUGHT IN ARMED ROBBERY OF BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE

<P>
A man and a woman were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of taking $100 at gunpoint 
from a beauty supply store, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred shortly after 1 p.m. when a man walked into Regal Beauty 
Supply and demanded money after showing the store's lone employee a handgun, 
Police Sgt. Bob Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman then fled the store with the money and ran to a blue pickup parked 
outside the store in the 800 block of North Tustin Street, Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
The store employee ran out of the shop and yelled to two passers-by that she 
had been robbed, Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
The passers-by followed the gunman, who turned to them before getting into the 
truck, pointed the gun at them and warned them not to get involved, Gustafson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman got into the passenger side of the truck, and the woman drove off. 
</P>
<P>
The passers-by followed the suspects in their car but stopped when the gunman 
got out of the truck and "again pointed a gun at them and told them to quit 
following," Gustafson said. Moments later, a police officer spotted the 
suspects' truck, pulled it over and arrested them. The money was recovered, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Booked on suspicion of robbery were Danny Lee White, 40, of no known address, 
and Jeanette Carpenter Jorgensen, 38, of Chino.

<P>
A 14-year-old Anaheim boy insisted to police in a videotaped interview played 
in court Tuesday that his fatal shooting of his 12-year-old sister was an 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd wanted to kill her, I'd have taken her out to a ditch or something -- 
no witnesses, see. That's what you got to think about," Richard D. Hubler told 
an Anaheim police investigator who was secretly videotaping the interview. "I'm 
not stupid. I know about that." 
</P>
<P>
The videotape also shows Hubler displaying a range of emotions when he was left 
alone in the interview room. At one point, he said a prayer, "Please, God, 
please don't let her die." But later, still alone, he said, "Three years. 
Damn!" 
</P>
<P>
Hubler, who was on probation for two weapons violations at the time, had 
earlier speculated to the police investigator, Carl Martin, that he might end 
up with a three-year sentence because of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler is being tried for murder in the June 14 death of his sister, Gema 
Marie, who was shot once in the head at the Hublers' Anaheim Shores home. The 
girl, who never regained consciousness, died four days later. The case is being 
heard by Superior Court Judge Robert E. Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claim that Hubler shot his sister after they argued over the use of 
the telephone. But Hubler's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Sharon Petrosino, 
contends that the shooting was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Brent F. Romney on Tuesday rested the prosecution's case 
after four days, concluding with Martin's interview of Hubler, which was 
videotaped on the day of the shooting. The defense is scheduled to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler was shirtless and barefoot and wearing cutoff jeans when first 
interviewed, the videotape shows. 
</P>
<P>
On the videotape, Hubler initially told Martin in detail about three intruders 
who shot his sister and how he believed that they were from a local gang that 
recently took shots at him and his friends, then threatened to kill their 
families. But Hubler gave up that story after Martin told him that lab tests 
would show whether he had fired the gun that killed his sister. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler then repeatedly said he thought that the gun, a .22-caliber rifle, was 
empty when he aimed it at her and pulled the trigger while "just messing 
around." 
</P>
<P>
"It was an accident," Hubler said. "I cocked it and pulled the trigger and 
'Boom!' it went off. I didn't even know I was pointing at her. I aimed it at 
her the first time, but not that time." 
</P>
<P>
Hubler said he had aimed plenty of guns at his sister before while playing 
around and nothing had ever happened. He added that she had never complained 
about such dangerous horseplay. 
</P>
<P>
But Martin told Hubler that his sister regained consciousness at the hospital 
-- which wasn't true -- and told police that he had shot her on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"No way," Hubler said. "Why would I want to shoot my own sister?" He added that 
she probably said that about him because "she's scared right now. She's 
probably mad at me. I know she is." 
</P>
<P>
During the two hours of interrogation, Hubler tripped over his version of 
events numerous times. At first, he said he pulled the trigger once while 
aiming the rifle at his sister and nothing happened; the gun went off the 
second time he pulled the trigger. Later, he said the gun fired on the third 
time he pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler also denied shooting the gun any other time that day. But when Martin 
said neighbors reported hearing two other gunshots, Hubler admitted that he had 
shot in the air twice before going upstairs to his sister's room to show her 
the gun. 
</P>
<P>
During his interview with police, Hubler showed extensive knowledge of guns. He 
discussed at least six guns that he had had in his possession at one time. He 
also said he was the one who had turned the rifle into a sawed-off gun the 
night before the shooting by using a hacksaw because he thought it made the 
rifle "look good." 
</P>
<P>
Hubler's father, James, watched the videotape intently, occasionally glancing 
at his son.

JUDGE BANS VIDEOS IN PACEWITZ MURDER TRIAL 
</P>

<P>
An Orange County Superior Court judge Tuesday disallowed two key pieces of 
evidence intended to show that Michael Robert Pacewitz was insane when a 
3-year-old Fullerton girl was murdered earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence, Pacewitz's videotaped statements to police and a psychiatrist 
that a prosecutor said contained "talk about the devil" and drug use, would 
confuse the jury, Judge Richard L. Weatherspoon ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor had argued to exclude the tapes, while the defense had tried to 
convince the judge that the jury should hear them. 
</P>
<P>
However, Weatherspoon said that not only would the tapes be confusing but in 
fact they might work against the defendant, who has entered a plea of not 
guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon said that before making his ruling, he viewed both videotapes and 
"observed a tired defendant" responding to "leading questions." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a psychiatrist," the judge said, "but I didn't get much out of viewing 
these tapes . . . of his mental state." 
</P>
<P>
Arguing for exclusion of the tapes in Tuesday's hearing, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Bryan Brown said Pacewitz concocted references to the devil and lied about drug 
use to bolster subsequent claims of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz, 21, is on trial for the March 3 murder of Marcelline Onick and the 
March 2 attempted murders of his mother, Elena Fontaine, and her boyfriend, 
Juan Martinez Marin. 
</P>
<P>
The little girl was stabbed 44 times in the attack, Brown has told the jury. 
Pacewitz has told reporters that Satan ordered him to kill the girl. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some talk about the devil (on the tapes), but none of this devil talk 
comes up until police videotape his statement," Brown said in the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Pacewitz made no references to the devil when he called 911 to 
report the crime to Fullerton police early March 3 or when he talked to the 
police officer who arrested him early that morning. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendant tries to embellish on a state of conduct in an attempt to make 
him look crazy or crazier than he already is," Brown said in the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor also said Pacewitz lied to police investigators taking the March 
3 videotaped statement when he told them that he had been using crystal 
methamphetamine about the time the crimes were committed and had sexually 
assaulted the little girl. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent tests have revealed that Pacewitz has not used drugs in the past 
year and that the child had not been sexually assaulted, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a concocted version of the defendant's story," Brown said. "We've 
got a defendant thinking about how he's going to avoid responsibility in this 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
In his argument to have the tapes heard, Deputy Public Defender E. Robert Goss 
Jr. said there was no indication that Pacewitz was aware his statements were 
being videotaped by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm offering these to show the condition of Mr. Pacewitz's mental state," Goss 
said. "I think those tapes are very close in time to the commission of those 
offenses." 
</P>
<P>
Goss said Pacewitz's videotaped statement to Fullerton police was taken from 
12:20 p.m. to 4:05 p.m. March 3. Another statement to Dr. Kaushal Sharma, a 
psychiatrist, was videotaped the following day. 
</P>
<P>
"What other best evidence of Mr. Pacewitz's mental state than his taped 
interview with police and Dr. Sharma?" Goss said. 
</P>
<P>
Following the hearing, Goss said he was surprised by the judge's ruling and 
said it could be grounds for an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the jury has already been allowed to hear the prosecution's tape 
recording ofPacewitz's call to a 911 police dispatcher the morning of the 
murder in which the defendant admitted killing the child. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any sense," Goss said. "(The) jury only gets to hear what the 
D.A. wants them to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Testimony in the case is expected to resume Monday.

HELMET COMPANIES BUTT HEADS OVER RIDDELL POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the rear of his athletic equipment warehouse in Anaheim, Bob Brown walks 
through Orange County's football helmet graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
His 800 used and abused helmets, all awaiting a decent burial, feature the team 
logos and colors of almost every Orange County high school. 
</P>
<P>
There's Mater Dei's red-and-white-striped helmet, and Huntington Beach's black 
and orange gear. A pile of Ocean View's red-and-gold helmets sit nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who supplies every county school with football equipment and also 
repairs equipment, has watched the number of helmets passing through his 
warehouse increase steadily in the past three years. After Riddell, the 
nation's leading football helmet manufacturer, announced last fall that testing 
showed its used and unused helmets had a life span of 10 years, the used 
helmets started pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it wouldn't be liable for any player injured while wearing 
those helmets, and schools across the nation scrambled to buy new ones. 
</P>
<P>
Brown ships most of the used helmets back to Riddell's main office in Chicago, 
where they will be destroyed. He asks schools that are buying new helmets to 
return their old ones to him in an attempt to keep a dangerous helmet from 
being used. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to dispose of the whole batch in some way," Brown said. "We drill 
holes in them so they can't be used again. We usually don't have this many 
sitting around. We should be smashing them up, but we've fallen behind." 
</P>
<P>
Some schools cut the helmets in half and turn them into wall plaques. 
</P>
<P>
"They make for nice trophies," said Jim Griffis,director of administrative 
services with the Garden Grove Unified School District. "The schools give them 
out at their awards banquets at the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
But for all their creative uses, Riddell's retired helmets have created quite a 
fuss throughout the nation's school systems -- and among competing sporting 
goods manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The other two helmet manufacturing companies, Athletic Helmet, Inc., which 
makes the Air brand, and All American, which makes the Maxpro brand, have not 
set a life expectancy for their helmets. 
</P>
<P>
The competing helmet manufacturers have questioned Riddell's policy, suggesting 
that it was motivated only to increase sales of its helmets. 
</P>
<P>
Don Gleisner, president of All American, said, "We disagree with the Riddell 
philosophy. We feel a helmet should not be retired because of age. It should be 
retired because of use or abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"A helmet worn by a middle linebacker could be done in a year or two seasons. A 
punter's helmet could last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Riddell officials deny using the policy as a way to sell more helmets. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Arnett, national sales manager for Riddell, said the company is more 
concerned with protecting football players than selling helmets. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is the athlete," Arnett said. "I think it's a great 
opportunity for us to keep our product neat and clean." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said many schools misinterpreted Riddell's purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of hysteria out there and it's not being created by us," he 
said. "It's being created by our competitors." 
</P>
<P>
Riddell's announcement came at a time when the company and its competitors have 
been battling over an equipment contract with the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Riddell offers free helmets to NFL teams in return for its logo display on the 
helmets. NFL players can wear a competing brand of helmet, but the logo must be 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
"They give the pros free helmets to get nationwide advertising," Gleisner said. 
"But then they turn around and charge high schools $100 each to replace theirs. 
I think they're showing disrespect to the nation's high schools." 
</P>
<P>
All American saw the Riddell policy as a chance to sell its Maxpro brand. All 
American cut $10 off its regular price of $79.99 in an attempt to attract 
Riddell customers. 
</P>
<P>
Riddell, the oldest manufacturer of football helmets, started its current 
design in 1973 and has dominated the market. 
</P>
<P>
All American is in its third year of making helmets, and Athletic Helmet, Inc., 
a descendant of the Bike brand helmet, is four years old. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth manufacturer, Rawlings Sporting Goods Co., quit making helmets in May 
1988, citing increased liability and skyrocketing insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems we have is that we're so much older than our competitors," 
Arnett said. "Our research is an ongoing thing, but it's something that was 
brought to the forefront two years ago when we saw a lot of helmets being 
reconditioned and recertified that shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
Brown reconditions and recertifies helmets for the Orange County schools. 
</P>
<P>
He said he repairs most helmets for about $20, depending on what parts are 
needed. Most schools have their helmets reconditioned annually. 
</P>
<P>
"The individual parts (such as facemask and padding) have gone up so much that 
you could almost buy a new helmet," he said. "I've worked on some eight- and 
nine-year-old helmets that cost $40 or $50 to fix." 
</P>
<P>
And if they're beyond repair . . . it's off to the graveyard.

ON THE PREP PATH: TALK OF SEPARATE SECTION COULD DIVIDE COUNTY TEAMS, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Fueled by coffee, cookies and feasibility studies, superintendents of Orange 
County public high schools convened Monday afternoon in Anaheim in a 
closed-door session to debate that ever-pressing question: 
</P>
<P>
Orange County in the CIF-Southern Section . . . To flee, or not to flee? 
</P>
<P>
You would have thought it was a meeting of the National Security Council, if 
not a meeting of the minds on the set of "Twin Peaks," as the meeting's 
atmosphere was oh-so-hushed. 
</P>
<P>
The session was held to discuss whether it is reasonable or fiscally 
responsible to consider a separate CIF section for Orange County's public high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Note that it was only public schools that were being discussed. Parochial and 
private high schools were not figured into this equation. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, no representatives from parochial schools were invited to this 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Hartman, superintendent of Saddleback Valley Unified School District, 
put it this way: 
</P>
<P>
"No, they weren't invited . . . (There is) the concern that parochial schools 
play by different rules in terms of recruiting students. Historically, they've 
always competed against other private schools in their own leagues. Now an 
effort has been made to change that long historical practice of keeping private 
and public schools separate . . . We don't want that." 
</P>
<P>
In superintendentspeak, that means sorry, Mater Deis of the world, but you're 
out of the pretty picture we're trying to create. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about an Orange County section has been going around for more than 10 
years. Last year, a group of principals discussed the possibility, then voted 
on whether to undertake a formal study to pursue the issue. The measure was 
voted down by a slim margin. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, money is the greatest concern. Currently, the Southern 
Section's dues are a state-low 23 cents per student. Some say the upkeep of an 
Orange County section could cost schools three or four times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
But there are others who say the cost could be deferred by the enormous 
potential in Orange County for corporate sponsorship. Imagine the lucrative 
opportunities lurking among all those mini-malls: 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the CIF-Orange County Section-Freddie's Frozen Yogurt Football 
Playoffs! 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of such a section would undoubtedly save on the schools' travel 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Woodbridge had to travel five hours to Atascadero for a playoff 
game. Not only would play within the county save money, it would save on 
students' time away from class. 
</P>
<P>
By size alone, Orange County and its 76 high schools -- 57 of them public -- 
would appear ready to break away from the Southern Section. The Southern 
Section, which stretches as far north as Mammoth and south to the Mexican 
border, is the largest of the CIF's 10 sections with nearly 500 high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Section (72 schools) broke away from the Southern Section more 
than 30 years ago and never looked back. Parochial schools belong, but since 
none has more than 500 students, they pose no real threat to public school 
powers, assistant section commissioner Jan Jessop said. 
</P>
<P>
It seems almost inevitable that Orange County will have its own section. Some 
estimate it will take between three to five years, once the process is started, 
to get the section fully implemented. So why wait any longer? 
</P>
<P>
But the tricky question: What to do with the non-public schools? 
</P>
<P>
It's a complicated issue. 
</P>
<P>
According to Esperanza Principal George Allen, who chaired the principals' 
study last year, the state federation has hinted it wouldn't be supportive of 
an Orange County section that refuses non-public schools. 
</P>
<P>
But, like Hartman, there is a growing number of those opposed to admitting 
schools that can draw -- many would say recruit -- from anywhere inside or 
outside the county. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, this topic is sure to stay hot for some time. At 9 a.m. Thursday, 
the Southern Section General Council will meet at the Sequoia Athletic Club in 
Buena Park. The agenda includes discussion of an Orange County section. The 
meeting is open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Grab a cookie and take a seat. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting of all Angelus League principals was held Tuesday at St. John Bosco 
High School in Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
The subject? How to improve the image of parochial schools in the eyes of 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, because of the recent Derek Sparks controversy at Mater Dei, Angelus 
League principals met to discuss how better to handle such problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to let everyone know that because we're trying to get into public 
leagues in two years, controversy is not what we need right now," said one 
Angelus League official, who asked not to be identified.

<P>
DELPINO, MCGEE POSE DOUBLE THREAT AT FULLBACK

<P>
With three tailbacks sharing the load, the Rams might not have their 
traditional 1,000-yard rusher this season. They might, however, end up with the 
two most efficient fullbacks around. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Delpino caught two passes in Sunday's victory over the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers and now leads the team in scoring. Two catches, two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Buford McGee caught one pass against the Buccaneers. It was only a six-yarder 
over the middle, but it was worth six points. 
</P>
<P>
The final score Sunday? Ram fullbacks 18, Buccaneers 14. 
</P>
<P>
Fullbacks don't pick up much rushing yardage in a John Robinson offense. These 
two have rushed the ball only six times this season -- McGee four times for 26 
yards and Delpino twice for 13 -- and have a combined average of 4.8 yards per 
carry. 
</P>
<P>
Fullbacks certainly aren't overlooked in an Ernie Zampese passing game, though. 
They've caught seven passes -- McGee four for 26 yards and Delpino two totaling 
62 -- for a combined 12.6-yard per catch average. 
</P>
<P>
McGee is the starter, but Delpino certainly gets his share of the glory. There 
is, however, one major difference between them. McGee spends most of his time 
flinging his body at linebackers; Delpino seems to show up only when it's time 
to dance in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"What winds up happening is that Buford handles the routine of the fullback, 
the blocking and basically gets the (crap) kicked out of him," Robinson said. 
"Buford's got towels and ice packs all over him. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby can handle those same things but probably isn't as good as Buford right 
now. Bobby we want to have the football and we tend to hold him until we want 
him." 
</P>
<P>
It's getting to the point where the mere sight of Delpino in the huddle should 
send off alarms in the headsets of defensive coordinators. And that, Robinson 
concedes, needs to be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making a mistake if they're saying, 'Here comes Delpino, they're 
throwing the ball.' We planned to use him half the time (against Tampa Bay). It 
didn't work out. But he's got to play more." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Gary might be the tailback of the future for the Rams, but he doesn't 
figure to dominate the position until he can shake off the effects of the lower 
back injury that has hampered him since the beginning of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
He carried the ball eight times for 42 yards in the second half Sunday, but his 
back is still bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to get going," said Gary, who missed all four exhibition games 
and the regular-season opener, "but it's still a little sore. I'm just not 
100%. It's been frustrating. It's just something I have to work through. 
</P>
<P>
"You get those twinges. I really don't know how to put it into words. It's just 
there. It's getting better, slowly, but I'll just be glad when it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
Seven would-be kickoff specialists worked out Tuesday at Rams Park, including 
Vince Abbott (Cal State Fullerton and the USFL's L.A. Express), Dave Van 
Steenkiste (Cal State Long Beach) and John Carney (Notre Dame). All seven have 
been to NFL training camps but none made the final cut. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are looking for someone to kick off in the event Mike Lansford, who 
has a partial tear of the muscle near the Achilles' tendon, can only be used 
for field goals and extra points. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford, who says it hurts more to walk than kick, thinks he'll be able to 
handle all the kicking chores Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Rams 
are making contingency plans, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Kill the theme to Road Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have played eight of their past 10 games -- counting the end of last 
season and this exhibition season -- on the road. Sunday, they will meet the 
Philadelphia Eagles on the unfamiliar turf of Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
If they can find their way there. 
</P>
<P>
"Our routine will be the same this week," Robinson said, jokingly. "Friday, 
we'll practice a little later than usual, then we'll go to the airport and say 
'Oh, we're playing at home.' And then we'll come back." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have played well on the road recently -- they were 7-4 including the 
playoffs last year -- but Robinson still prefers a home game. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think you wear down on the road," he said. "I'm not quite sure what the 
effect is (at home), but it's just better. We had the last four on the road 
last year, one in Berlin, two on the East Coast and one in the Midwest.

HER GOAL A KICK FOR WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM 
</P>

<P>
It was only one measly goal, and Dawn Evans is half-embarrassed at the 
commotion over it. 
</P>
<P>
A St. Mary's player tried to make a pass back to her goalkeeper in a game 
Sunday against UC Irvine. Evans, playing forward, cut in front of the goalie, 
took the ball away and put it into the empty net. 
</P>
<P>
There was a momentary delay, and then exultation. For a split second, it was as 
if the Irvine players hadn't realized what had happened. Evans had scored the 
Anteaters' first goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
After six games, Irvine's women's soccer team has a record of 0-5-1. 
</P>
<P>
But Evans' goal, fluky as it was, brought laughter and enthusiasm to a team 
that had a 5-11-4 record last season and has had five coaches in the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really a great feeling," said Alicia Miller, the Anteater goalkeeper 
who feels the pressure of knowing Irvine is not going to score often. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody felt pretty positive after that game," said Kerry McGrath, another 
player on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who didn't play soccer during her first two seasons at Irvine, instead 
choosing to work nearly 40 hours a week to pay expenses as she plans for law 
school, smiles cautiously when asked about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an open net," said Evans, who played mostly halfback last season in her 
first year on the team. "I should have scored. . . . I think it's funny. It's 
not like I'm a leading scorer or have some huge tally of goals." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a junior from Estancia High School, is faced with trying to keep the 
games close, even when Irvine isn't scoring. She has 71 saves in six games this 
season, and has allowed 11 goals, a 1.5 goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating," Miller said. "We're trying to keep in mind that we've gone 
through all the changes in coaches. We're trying to keep our heads up about it 
and look forward to next year." 
</P>
<P>
Next year, they hope to have the same coach. Ray Smith, who took the job just 
before the season, had been an assistant coach at Biola University and coach of 
the boys' team at Katella High School. 
</P>
<P>
"Ray's here to stay," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody really likes Ray," McGrath said. "He's a very positive person." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's last coach, Janu Juarez, lasted more than a season. He coached for 
three years and left after the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
The next coach, Lisa Fraser, coached the team during spring practice but left 
after a short time when offered the head coaching job at Washington State, 
where the program has financial resources far better than Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Left without a coach in the last weeks before the start of the 1989 season, 
Irvine asked Steve Shaw, a former member of the men's team who was finishing 
his degree, to take the job for the season. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Irvine hired Keith Comfort, a former assistant at UC Davis who was 
attending graduate school at Colorado State. Comfort accepted the job one day, 
then called back the next to renege. 
</P>
<P>
Then Irvine hired Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"He realized that we're not going to be No. 1," McGrath said. "But if we lose, 
1-0, to a team we lost to, 7-0, last year, that's improvement. We're getting 
better." 
</P>
<P>
With Miller in goal, Irvine has allowed more than three goals only once this 
season. Three times, they have lost, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Collins, the only senior on a women's volleyball team heavy with freshmen 
and sophomores, is moving closer to several school records. 
</P>
<P>
With 49 kills in three matches last week, she moved to within two kills of Kris 
Roberts (1985-88) in second place on the career list with 1,042, and is closing 
in on Ali Wood's (1986-89) school record of 1,183. Collins is also among the 
leaders in attack attempts and digs. 
</P>
<P>
Her match against Loyola Marymount last week was her best during a week that 
earned her player of the week honors in the Big West Conference, considered the 
top volleyball conference in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been a stat hound," Collins said. "Sure, it feels good to say I had 
this many kills or digs, but there's nothing there if our team loses." 
</P>
<P>
Collins was a hurdler and relay sprinter at Tustin High School, but switched to 
volleyball after a knee injury ended her track career. 
</P>
<P>
Now Collins loves volleyball, including the beach variety. She would like to 
end her career by making it back to the NCAA tournament, as the team did two 
years ago when Roberts, a middle blocker, was the leader of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll repeat that this year, if it's in my power," Collins said. "Physically 
right now, I'd say we're a great team. Mentally . . . we need to build 
confidence. I think so many people point out that they're so young that they 
feel they should be worried." 
</P>
<P>
Anteater notes 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's water polo team, the defending NCAA champion, fell from fifth to 
seventh in the top 20 poll of the American Water Polo Coaches Assn. after 
finishing sixth in its own tournament last weekend. The Anteaters went 2-3 
against a field that included seven of the top eight teams. Irvine lost its 
last three games in the tournament, each by one goal. UCLA defeated USC in the 
final. . . . Aaron Mascorro, an Irvine student, finished first in the Fresno 
State Invitational cross-country meet, but it meant no points for Irvine. 
Mascorro was competing unattached, while he and Coach Vince O'Boyle try to 
decide whether he should sit out this season and return to use his final year 
of eligibility next year. If Mascorro competes this year he might qualify for 
the NCAA championships as an individual, O'Boyle said. If he competes next 
year, the team, a year older, would have an opportunity to qualify. O'Boyle, 
eager not to waste Mascorro's excellent conditioning work this summer, expects 
to make a decision within a week.

HOME SALES RISE TO HIGHEST LEVEL IN 12 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County homes sales in August reached their highest monthly total in the 
past 12 months, a regional real estate data firm reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But last month's sales remained relatively flat in contrast with August, 1989, 
dropping a scant 1% to 4,432 units, from 4,475 units a year earlier. At the 
same time, the average price of a home in the county -- new and resale units 
combined -- rose 1.7%, to $256,993 from $252,645 in August, 1989, according to 
TRW Real Estate Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
And average new-home prices in August dropped below the average for resale 
homes. That is just the third time that has happened since TRW began tracking 
the data in January, 1988, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The average new home sold for $255,465 in August, slightly less than the 
$257,431 price tag on the average resale home. 
</P>
<P>
That disparity underscores the efforts developers have made to slash prices on 
existing inventory and to bring smaller, less expensive homes onto the market 
in a bid to revive new-home sales in the county. 
</P>
<P>
TRW's monthly report tallied home sales that closed in August -- meaning that 
the actual sales contracts in most cases were signed from one to three months 
earlier. TRW's report includes all new and resale transactions, for both 
attached and single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the downturn in sales from a year earlier, the report shows a spurt of 
new activity in August after a relatively slow summer. August sales were 10.1% 
higher than the 4,024 sales reported in July. 
</P>
<P>
That increase was expected, the spokesman said, because TRW's data reflects 
sales contracts signed at the beginning of the summer season -- typically the 
best time of the year for residential sales. 
</P>
<P>
Resale homes made up most of the August activity, with 3,743 units -- 84.5% of 
the total -- changing hands, TRW said. Sales volume for resale homes was up 
0.9% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The average August resale price was 2.1% higher than the $252,127 reported in 
August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
New-home prices, which have been falling as developers strive to move existing 
inventory in a slow market, picked up a slight 0.4% from a year ago but 
continued the current downward trend, falling 1.2% to $255,465 from the July 
average of $258,640.

They Can Hardly Wait: At Mitsubishi Motor Sales headquarters in Cypress, the 
adrenaline is pumping as Oct. 1 approaches. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the company -- experiencing its best year since hitting the United 
States in 1983 -- unleashes its $30,000, 300-horsepower, 150-m.p.h., 
dual-turbocharged, all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering 3000 GT VR-4, and its 
less-expensive sibling, the 3000 GT. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers across the country initially will receive a skimpy allotment of the 
low-slung 2+2 coupes -- only 2,000 are expected to be sent to 400 dealers by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Lepley, vice president of sales for the Mitsubishi division, said the 
company already has received orders and deposits for 1,500 of the cars -- most 
for the beefier 3000 GT VR-4.

$7-MILLION INVESTMENT DIVERTED, EXAMINER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: BANKRUPTCY COURT REPORT SAYS PARKER NORTH AMERICAN CORP. TURNED FUNDS 
FROM COLUMBIA S&amp;L INTO CASHIER'S CHECKS TO PARKER'S CHAIRMAN, HIS FAMILY 
AND HIS ASSOCIATES, AMONG OTHERS.

<P>
A report filed Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here concludes that more than 
$7 million that a Beverly Hills thrift gave Parker North American Corp. to 
invest ended up instead as cashier's checks made out to former Chairman Michael 
E. Parker, his family and business associates, and to a Lake Tahoe casino and a 
Newport Beach auto dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Beverly Hills gave the money to Parker 
North American to invest in equipment leasing deals. But the examiner's report 
concludes that the thrift was misled by Parker North American into investing in 
fictitious deals. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 42, is a prominent Newport Beach businessman and was chairman of Parker 
North American until the day before it filed for bankruptcy in March, 1989. 
Parker North American leased equipment such as automated teller machines to 
banks and savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
Parker is now chairman of Parker Automotive Corp. in Costa Mesa, a publicly 
held manufacturer of engine-cleaning products. 
</P>
<P>
Parker North American is the subject of several lawsuits alleging fraud and is 
also under investigation by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service. The FBI 
has questioned Parker and at least one of his business associates. 
</P>
<P>
Parker did not return phone calls Tuesday. In earlier interviews, however, he 
has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy examiner, accountant Robert Poyourow of Los Angeles, said 
Tuesday that his report stops short of concluding the Columbia money was 
transferred wrongfully to bank accounts outside Parker North American. It will 
take more research to determine if any wrongdoing occurred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A bankruptcy court hearing is scheduled Oct. 18 to discuss the report and 
determine whether the judge will ask Poyourow to continue the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Poyourow examined 10 leases involving 17 transactions between 1984 and 1988. 
The FBI has seized those and other documents, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 17 transactions, Poyourow's report says, documents showed the value of 
11 "were inflated" and the investments were worth less than Columbia was led to 
believe. Six of the transactions were "fictitious in that they did not exist or 
were never consummated" by Parker. 
</P>
<P>
In two instances, Parker had leased different equipment from what it had told 
Columbia. And, in one case, the same investment had been sold not only to 
Columbia but to another investor as well, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia was declared insolvent and new management installed by federal 
regulators this year for reasons unrelated to the Parker North American 
investments. The thrift invested $31 million with Parker North American, and 
now alleges in a suit in federal court in Los Angeles that the company stole at 
least $13 million of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Parker won't comment directly on the suit. But he has suggested that Columbia, 
which is being sued by the federal government for allegedly squandering funds, 
is trying to shift blame for its own troubles onto him. 
</P>
<P>
Almost $4 million of the Columbia money went to Parker from whoever took the 
Columbia checks to local banks and converted them to cashier's checks. At least 
11 of them were made out to Parker and dozens more checks were made out to 
other people, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian W. Fink of Orange, a former Parker North American vice president, got 11 
checks totaling $850,000. Fink could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Ten checks totaling $1.4 million went to Jeffrey S. Worthy of Downey, the 
former Columbia vice president who oversaw the thrift's investments in Parker 
North American. Worthy couldn't be reached for comment, but he denied in an 
earlier interview that the payments were kickbacks from Parker to look the 
other way on the lease deals. Worthy said Parker paid him for business deals 
unrelated to Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The examiner's report also found that: 
</P>
<P>
* Gilbert Fuentes, Worthy's former boss at Columbia as chief financial officer, 
got one check for $200,000 in 1986. Fuentes, who left Columbia in late 1985, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
* Harrah's Tahoe casino in Lake Tahoe received a $100,000 cashier's check in 
1986 endorsed by Parker, the report says. Fink also signed over one of his 
$50,000 checks to the casino in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
* William E. Parker of Irvine, Michael Parker's father and a former employee of 
Parker North American, got two checks totaling $494,000 in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
* Cindy S. Juranek, Parker's wife, received a check for $79,308 in 1986. Karen 
M. Parker, Parker's ex-wife, got a $100,000 check in 1987 a few months after 
Michael Parker married Juranek. William and Karen Parker could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
* A check for $46,000 went to Beach Imports, a Newport Beach imported auto 
dealership, in 1985.

JUDGE DELAYS APPOINTING TRUSTEE FOR FUNDAMERICA 
</P>

<P>
A federal bankruptcy judge on Tuesday delayed for at least 30 days the 
appointment of a trustee to assume management of FundAmerica, the controversial 
Irvine multilevel marketing firm that authorities in California and several 
other states have accused of operating a pyramid scheme. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James N. Barr ordered FundAmerica to allow an independent 
examiner to review its business practices and company records, but temporarily 
denied a request by Florida regulators to name a trustee. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica and its founder, Robert T. Edwards, are facing criminal charges in 
Florida of running a pyramid scheme. The company filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection from creditors last month and has temporarily stopped 
selling memberships. 
</P>
<P>
The examiner is required to file a report by Oct. 15 that will include a 
recommendation on whether FundAmerica's current management should be allowed to 
continue running the company, or whether a court-appointed trustee should take 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Sally S. Neely, an attorney representing the state of Florida, claimed that 
FundAmerica President Mitchell Blumberg had close ties with FundAmerica's past 
management. Blumberg, she said, is "part of the problem, not part of the 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
Blumberg, once one of FundAmerica's top salesmen, has said he had minimal 
contact with Edwards, who resigned shortly after his arrest on July 19. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an illegal, fraudulent scheme. It was perpetrated on hundreds of 
thousands of people and this court and the bankruptcy system should not be used 
to hide them," Neely said. "It would simply impugn the integrity of the 
bankruptcy system if the same people are (left) in charge." 
</P>
<P>
But FundAmerica attorney Lawrence Bass asked Barr not to appoint a trustee. He 
said some Canadian investors who have provided $1.3 million to help keep 
FundAmerica's parent company afloat would stop contributing if a trustee is 
named. 
</P>
<P>
"If a trustee is appointed," Bass said, "it would be the death knell for 
FundAmerica." 
</P>
<P>
Besides deciding who should run FundAmerica, the examiner will look into about 
$17 million in overseas fund transfers Edwards allegedly made before he left 
the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in California and several other states have contended that 
FundAmerica is a well-disguised pyramid scheme that relies on the sale of 
memberships for most of its revenue. But company officials say it is a 
legitimate consumer club, obtaining discounts for its members on such services 
as long-distance telephone calls.

Sunday Afternoon in the Shade 
</P>
<P>
WestMed Gold Club, a support group for Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, was 
host for a party at the Orange County Fairgrounds on Sunday in conjunction with 
the Orange County Horse Show Assn.'s championship finals. About 250 VIPs 
crowded two white tents ringside and watched local riders put their mounts 
through their paces. Out there -- on the ground, in the riding ring, in the 
free bleacher seats -- the sun shined blindingly bright. Benefit guests enjoyed 
a shady view of events, as well as a lavish buffet lunch and pay-per-order 
service bar. The party raised about $30,000, which will be used to buy 
cardiology equipment for the hospital's trauma center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Four-Legged Attractions 
</P>
<P>
The riders -- all of whom had won in previous OCHSA-sanctioned shows -- 
competed in hunter, high jump and relay classes. Among contestants in the 
four-day show, which culminated with Sunday's benefit, was Karen Lucian, a 
Newport Beach stockbroker and owner of a horse named "Capital Gains." Eyeing 
the raffle table, Lucian cut a stylish figure in her shiny black boots, tan 
riding breeches and Western hat with a three-foot turquoise feather tucked in 
its band. Asked how she fared in the riding ring, Lucian smiled. Capital Gains 
"won one championship and two reserve championships," she said. All by himself? 
"Well, I was riding him," she added, laughing, "but you always say the horse 
won." Causing a stir behind one of the tents were two miniature horses grazing 
in a pen that would cramp some large dogs. While the tiny equines nibbled grass 
and whisked flies with their little tails, a crowd of onlookers gathered. 
Howard Larnard, president of WestMed Gold Club, lifted his granddaughter, 
Kellie, so she could get a better view. Larnard, who lives with his wife, Ann, 
in the horsy Nellie Gale community in Laguna Hills, admitted that he is a soft 
touch for his granddaughter. Kellie, meanwhile, threw her arms around grandpa's 
neck and said how much she'd like a horse of her own. "It's no fun riding 
unless you have your own horse," she said.

Marianne Boyd, a hospital support group member, was co-chairwoman for the 
event, with Mike Braun, OCHSA president. Their committee included Robert 
Boullon, Corinne Brewster, Ron Elliott, Devon McVey and Trudy Passo. Also 
attending were Dr. Michael Callaghan, an orthopedic specialist at Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana, and his wife, Naomi; the hospital CEO David Morgan 
and his wife, Kyoko, and Dr. John West, founder of the Orange County Trauma 
Society. PAMELA MARIN

<P>
Despite the computer's penetration of our society, only a small percentage of 
us have become friendly with the creatures. 
</P>
<P>
Computers have a way of discouraging even the motivated user. "I don't think 
there's any other consumable item that people buy that requires so much 
training," says Bill Hoffman, co-owner of Hoffman Computer Systems in Anaheim. 
"People perceive a computer as a commodity; it's not." 
</P>
<P>
Says Michael Brinda, president of New Horizons Computer Learning Center in 
Santa Ana, "You're sold the machine and have an elevated sense of how easy it 
will be." 
</P>
<P>
For people at all levels of familiarity with computers, Orange County schools 
and businesses offer classes ranging from a few hours to six months that can be 
combined in a variety of ways to take you from total ignorance to expertise 
without excessive agony. 
</P>
<P>
Hands-on instruction has at least one overwhelming benefit: Procedures that may 
take hours to deduce from a manual can be often taught in a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
An inexpensive route to learning the computer lies in Orange County's community 
college system. Semester-long classes walk students through the basics, giving 
the student plenty of time to become comfortable with the computer. 
</P>
<P>
At Orange Coast College, which has more than 250 computers for training, 
classes fill to capacity every semester. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two missions," says Bob Wilson, dean of the Business Education 
Division. "First, to provide education for students going on to a four-year 
school. Second, providing technical skills for people to get a job or to 
increase knowledge for the job market." 
</P>
<P>
Classes are equally divided between beginners and people coming in for 
upgrading and retraining, Wilson says. Courses in such applications as 
WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3 are extremely popular. He calls "C" programming 
"monstrous" right now in its appeal to engineers and aspiring programmers. And 
in addition to its IBM PC-compatible computers, Orange Coast College has an 
Apple Macintosh lab. 
</P>
<P>
Computers have even infiltrated the typing courses at Orange Coast. "Our typing 
classes are taught on IBM PC's. We have no typewriters," Wilson says. "For the 
first three minutes, students are panicked, and then they love it. They see 
they're learning practical, real-world situations." 
</P>
<P>
The retention rate in the community college's computer classes is almost 70%, 
which Wilson notes is extremely good. "We keep a pretty good pulse on what the 
business community wants. As business quits using programs, we start phasing 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
Similar computer courses are offered at Coastline, Saddleback and the other 
county community colleges. Most of the schools also offer short courses ranging 
from one day to nine weeks through their community service programs. 
</P>
<P>
A number of private learning centers have sprung up throughout the county to 
meet the rising demand for computer training. 
</P>
<P>
* The New Horizons Computer Learning Center, which Michael Brinda started in 
1982, offers 640 classes covering roughly 100 different subjects, delivered in 
one- and two-day bites. Prices range from $49 to $348. The center also offers a 
club program where, for $598, students can take all the classes they want for 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
The ages of New Horizons students range across the board, Brinda says. The 
common denominator is that they're employed. "Most clients are beginners to an 
application, although most are somewhat computer literate," Brinda says. "The 
majority of New Horizon clients are from small- and medium-sized companies. 
Companies will hire us to do training for them." 
</P>
<P>
New Horizons is an authorized education center for such manufacturers as Apple 
Computers and Novell, which distributes a popular local area network. "Novell 
classes are growing, growing, growing," Brinda says. 
</P>
<P>
Instructors use not only computers and textbooks, but projectors that show 
monitor screens on the wall. The average class size is about 12, though some 
have more than 20 students. 
</P>
<P>
New Horizons' classes center largely on applications and operating systems. "We 
don't teach programming. You can't teach that in substance in a day or two," 
Brinda says. 
</P>
<P>
New Horizons also provides day-long training courses at such schools as the UC 
Irvine, Rio Hondo, Cerritos and Pasadena City College, usually through the 
community services division, for $89 a day. 
</P>
<P>
* At the Computer Learning Center in Anaheim, the program is oriented toward 
students looking to develop a solid grounding in one of three areas of 
specialization. Most students are full time, attending either day or evening 
classes for six months, says Al Nederhood, director of the CLC. 
</P>
<P>
Students can choose to focus on programming, computer operations or 
microcomputer systems. The most popular concentration is mainframe operations 
and management, Nederhood says. Students learn to work on an IBM mainframe 
computer similar to what they'll find at many mid-sized and large firms. 
</P>
<P>
The typical student at CLC is looking for salable skills and, often, a new 
career. Sixty to 70% of the 200-plus students are working, but they're not 
employer sponsored, Nederhood says. "We're looking for the full-time student 
who wants more than an introduction. We're more intensive and in-depth. We're 
not interested in leading edge. We offer what's going to help our students get 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
CLC maintains a separate department of graduate services, and such employers as 
Rockwell, TRW, Hughes and Home Club regularly interview CLC's graduates. 
</P>
<P>
The programming and operations tracks cost $6,150 each, while the microcomputer 
systems specialist track is $5,775. 
</P>
<P>
* Someone who has just bought a personal computer may be able to find training 
through the store where he or she bought the equipment. This wasn't always true 
in the earlier days of the personal computer, when buyers were often left to 
fend for themselves, and which is why so many personal computers are gathering 
dust. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the personal computer marketplace has grown increasingly 
competitive, and training has become a more important factor in selling a 
system, says Ralph Cooper, the educational manager at Hoffman Computer Systems 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The store runs regular classes to train its clients in computers and software, 
having found that users often had great difficulty setting up the systems on 
their own. "That's where the Macintosh shines; there's not so much jargon, and 
the interface is similar from one program to the next," Cooper says. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman's class sizes range from one-on-one to groups of 20 or 30. Some 
students are looking to learn to use what they have just purchased. Others are 
seeking to familiarize themselves with applications programs that are widely 
used in their fields. "People come in to make themselves more marketable," 
Cooper says. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Soto, Hoffman Computer's sales manager for IBM-compatible systems, teaches 
AutoCad, a program for civil engineering. Many of the engineers Soto encounters 
have a basic drafting and design background but are not yet computer literate. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman's instructors have found that if they make training goal-oriented, that 
is, orient training sessions to actual projects in which the students are 
involved, understanding comes more quickly. "We show them what they want to 
see, with their own work," Soto says. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper often finds that people new to computing have trouble distinguishing 
between the computer's operation and the job they want done. 
</P>
<P>
In one common scenario, for example, the owner of a new business may be trying 
to learn both how to operate the computer and how to handle the accounting for 
his business. He doesn't have enough background in either to know where the 
computing part ends and the accounting begins. 
</P>
<P>
As Cooper puts it, "The computer will not make an accountant out of you." 
</P>
<P>
To the minimally trained customer, this doesn't seem to make sense. "We were 
getting continual calls not on the hardware, not on the software, but about how 
to run their businesses." 
</P>
<P>
When any dealer sells a software package, the new user may find himself with a 
pile of manuals and absolutely no idea of how to set up the software for his 
business. When Hoffman Computers sells a specialized program such as an 
accounting package, it recommends consultants who can set up the program, in 
essence tuning it to the user's hardware. 
</P>
<P>
While computers will occasionally frustrate their users, the concepts that the 
average person needs to use a personal computer for, say, word processing or 
spreadsheets, are not especially difficult to grasp. Classes offer shortcuts 
through the learning process, reducing the trial-and-error floundering that 
makes learning from the manual so tedious. DAN LOGAN

SOME STEPS TO BUILDING LASTING LOVE

<P>
Infatuation may not last, but love can -- if you're willing to work at it. 
David and Sheryl Aronson of Laguna Niguel, who counsel singles and couples in 
their workshops and private practices, outlined the following basic ingredients 
of success: 
</P>
<P>
* Be self-reliant. 
</P>
<P>
If one partner is overly dependent, the relationship suffers. Maintain your own 
friends and interests so you won't need to be with your mate 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
* Be selectively dependent, not fiercely independent. Don't be afraid to allow 
yourself to depend on your partner for support, love and tenderness. That's not 
a sign of weakness. Strive for a healthy balance between dependence and 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
* Admit that you're not perfect -- and accept the imperfections in your 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
* Maintain a win-win mind-set. If only one person wins in a disagreement, you 
both lose. 
</P>
<P>
* Try standing in your partner's shoes. Your way is not always right. 
</P>
<P>
* Be accepting, not judgmental -- and start by accepting yourself. If you're 
hard on yourself, you'll be hard on your partner. SHERRY ANGEL

RELATIONSHIPS: KEEPING LOVE ALIVE LONG AFTER THE INFATUATION PHASE COMES TO AN 
END 
</P>

<P>
The family -- including several generations gathered for a reunion -- lingered 
around the table after dinner, and soon the talk turned to the subject of love. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you know when you're in love?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
The young people were quick to describe the symptoms: heart palpitations, 
sweaty palms, loss of appetite, insomnia, a feeling of euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
Then they turned to the widowed, 93-year-old matriarch of the family, expecting 
her to add something sentimental. Instead, she said, "What makes you think I 
loved your grandfather?" 
</P>
<P>
In her day, people didn't sit around and talk about love. If you had it, you 
were lucky; if you didn't, you made do. 
</P>
<P>
Today, if you don't have it, you get divorced. Or go to a workshop. 
</P>
<P>
"Can Men and Women Live Happily Ever After? How to Make It Reality in the 
1990s" was the title of a recent 90-minute workshop led by husband-wife team 
David and Sheryl Aronson to help couples find the kind of love that lasts after 
the heart stops pounding and the appetite returns. 
</P>
<P>
In their practices -- David, 39, is a clinical psychologist at Capistrano by 
the Sea Hospital in Dana Point, and Sheryl, 36, is a marriage and family 
counselor in Laguna Niguel -- they've seen many couples falter when their 
infatuation with each other fades. 
</P>
<P>
The 93-year-old grandmother may have missed out on love, but she was probably 
lucky she didn't approach marriage with the kind of expectations people have 
today. Often, they're simply setting themselves up for failure, the Aronsons 
cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate their point, they asked the participants at their recent workshop 
-- a mix of couples and singles -- to describe their ideal mate. Tracy Kerins, 
a 20-year-old Saddleback College student, said: "Someone with whom I could 
express my feelings openly and who would express his feelings with me. Someone 
who would accept me as I am. We'd have similar interests, and we'd always be 
doing things together. There wouldn't be confrontation. I'm a romantic, and I 
want the relationship to always be special -- I want to be on a forever 
honeymoon." 
</P>
<P>
Kerins smiles a bit sheepishly as she adds that she now has her first real 
boyfriend -- "and it's not perfect." 
</P>
<P>
They have entered what the Aronsons call the "disillusionment phase" of a 
relationship, when the euphoria of infatuation wears off and people begin to 
look critically at each other. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the danger zones on the path to a lasting, "mature love," the 
Aronsons said. During the infatuation stage, people tend to be on such a high 
that they don't see their prospective partner clearly; they simply assume he or 
she fits their fantasy and ignore trouble signs. 
</P>
<P>
But that high can't be sustained forever, and when it ends, some go so far to 
the other extreme that minor imperfections become glaring inadequacies, David 
Aronson said. "They may make a premature decision to end the relationship. 
People think this must be the wrong person or it wouldn't be happening." 
</P>
<P>
That may be true in some cases, the Aronsons said, but it is more likely that 
it's time to make some trade-offs between fantasy and reality. 
</P>
<P>
"Men and women can live happily ever after in the '90s, but there has to be a 
dedication to approach your relationship in a way you haven't before," Sheryl 
Aronson said. "It doesn't come naturally. It isn't easy. You both have to work 
at it." 
</P>
<P>
The most important step, she added, is improving communication. 
</P>
<P>
That was the purpose of a workshop "mirroring" exercise in which the 
participants were paired off and one person repeated what the other said. 
</P>
<P>
"It really helps you understand what your partner is saying," Sheryl Aronson 
explained. "Often, we're so ready to come back with an answer that we're not 
even listening." 
</P>
<P>
The couples at the workshop found it easy to do the talking, but difficult to 
simply repeat what their partner had said without adding their response. 
</P>
<P>
One man suggested to his wife of 19 years, "On our way to San Francisco over 
Thanksgiving, let's rent some equipment and camp out overnight." 
</P>
<P>
She winced but managed to save this response until it was her turn to talk: "I 
know that would be fun for you, but it's not fun for me. When we were in the 
infatuation stage, the last thing on your mind was camping." 
</P>
<P>
This part of the workshop was enlightening for another long-married couple who 
asked not to be named. On their way out, the woman said, "We both felt we were 
actually hearing each other." 
</P>
<P>
They were attracted to the workshop because he recently retired and the extra 
togetherness has brought conflicts to the surface -- including a feeling that 
they haven't fulfilled each other's fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
"Three weeks of infatuation, 37 years of disillusionment," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
"I took for granted that he wanted the same things out of life that I did," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have different goals," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Aronsons said that, with good communication, long-married couples can find 
ways to restore the excitement and passion of the infatuation stage to their 
relationship. And singles can increase their chances of having a happy marriage 
by taking time to get to know each other instead of rushing to the altar when 
they are still blinded by infatuation. 
</P>
<P>
Bill and Tracy Edwards of Newport Beach, who recently took a five-part workshop 
offered by the Aronsons, were married four years ago after knowing each other 
for only seven months. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very quick romance with lots of wining and dining and traveling," 
Tracy Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
When she got pregnant with the first of their two children shortly after they 
were married, reality set in -- with a thud. They had a lot to learn about each 
other, and there were surprises that tested their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
They learned, for example, that they had very different ideas about how to 
discipline their children. And they discovered they approached other major 
issues from different perspectives, partly because she's 29 and this is her 
first marriage and he's 40 and has been married twice before. 
</P>
<P>
Although they're happily married, they wish they'd taken more time to talk 
about such major issues as child rearing, religion, finances and goals. They 
would have had fewer difficulties adjusting to marriage if they had reached the 
point in dating where they could "see the spouse-to-be as just another human 
being and not expect too much and not overuse the rose-colored glasses," Bill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Marti Monroe, a Santa Ana marriage, family and child counselor, has developed a 
system to help clients become "discriminating daters" so they won't get carried 
away by romance and make decisions they might regret later. 
</P>
<P>
She is divorced and dating at 48 and, she said, the system has worked well for 
her. It is designed to help singles maintain their objectivity at a time when 
they're constantly tempted to give in to the demands of hyperactive hormones. 
</P>
<P>
To use her system, she explained, make an extensive list of the qualities 
you're looking for in a mate. Then list the activities most likely to tell you 
whether or not your date measures up. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one of the activities on Monroe's list is tennis. She knew one 
date was no match for her when she beat him and "he totally decomposed on the 
court. I can't handle anyone who can't lose at a game without falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
The most important part of her system, she stressed, is making a commitment to 
spend a minimum of 30 hours dating a person before having sex. "As long as I 
don't get bonded physically, I can stay objective and say, 'You're history.' " 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, she hadn't found anyone with whom she wanted to spend more than 
eight hours. But she's up to 19 hours with her current boyfriend, the only one 
who has been told about her rigorous test. 
</P>
<P>
"He's handling it all so graciously that it's hard to stay objective," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe is looking for something better than infatuation; she's seeking the kind 
of relationship in which you can "cherish and respect the other and be 
interested in their growth and well-being and at the same time work on your own 
growth." 
</P>
<P>
Now that Bill and Tracy Edwards have overcome their initial difficulties, 
they're also learning that love beyond infatuation can be richer than that 
brief, ecstatic high you get at the start of a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to appreciate each other as companions and friends," Tracy 
said. "Over time, you fall in love in a different way, in a way that's not a 
fairy tale." 
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone write love letters anymore? Have you saved some from long ago that 
are still special to you? Or perhaps you've received one recently that you'd 
like to share. Send your comments to "Relationships," Orange County View, The

Pacific Lumber -- The California &amp; Co. column published Aug. 28 left the 
impression that, as a result of its doubling of the redwood harvest, Pacific 
Lumber Co. was exporting logs and had not significantly increased lumber mill 
employment. A spokesman said the company does not export logs. Although 
industrywide mill employment in Humboldt County has not changed much as a 
result of increased harvest, the spokesman said Pacific Lumber has increased 
its employment by 300 to about 1,250 over the last four years.

SLAIN OFFICER'S BROTHER FIRED ON

<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty police officer, the brother of an officer killed two years ago 
allegedly by gang members, was the target of gunfire early today as he drove 
home from work, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Pratt, 27, who joined the Police Department shortly after his brother, 
Daniel, was killed in 1988, was not hit by the shots fired from another car as 
he drove north on the Long Beach Freeway, near the Santa Ana Freeway, in 
Commerce about 3:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt, who is assigned to the Southeast Division, fired back at the gunman, 
said Lt. Ken Lady. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said there was no evidence to indicate the attack was in any way 
connected to the 1988 slaying of Pratt's brother. 
</P>
<P>

GREENSPAN SEES THREAT OF RECESSION; 
</P>
<P>
FED'S CHAIRMAN SAYS ECONOMY IS BARELY GROWING

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned today the U.S. economy, reeling 
from Middle East oil shock, is barely growing and faces a real threat of 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Greenspan said 
rising petroleum prices after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait have hurt the U.S. 
economy by boosting inflation and stunting a business expansion that began in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
He gave no indication about the direction of interest rates, although he 
stressed that short-term rates could be expected to fall if President Bush and 
Congress agree on a five-year, $500-billion cut in the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Many mainstream economists contend the United States, which faced sluggish 
growth before the current oil shock, has already slipped into an economic 
downturn. But Greenspan cautiously disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still growing at this particular stage, very slowly," he said. "I don't 
see as yet any hard evidence on an immediate, day-by-day basis we have tilted 
over into any significant deterioration (or recession)." 
</P>
<P>
Chances of recession, Greenspan added, have "clearly risen with the onset of 
the crisis in the gulf, the oil shock. Whether or not it's greater than 50-50, 
I think it's actually too soon to say." 
</P>
<P>
It would be surprising, however, if consumers and businesses did not reduce 
spending, thus adding to recessionary pressures, in light of the gulf crisis, 
rising unemployment and slower economic growth, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's remarks were made at a particularly difficult time for Federal 
Reserve Board policy-makers setting short-term interest rates. The 
Administration has pressured the Fed to ease credit conditions to fight the 
economic slowdown, but Fed governors also have been concerned with keeping 
inflation in check. Now, both inflation and recession are bigger problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed chairman said that if crude oil prices average $30 a barrel over the 
next year, about $10 above the price before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, 
the higher oil prices would likely lower economic growth by a full percentage 
point over a year's time. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that a $10 per barrel jump in oil prices would add roughly $30 
billion to the country's annual import bill, draining away purchasing power 
from consumers and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
He said that inflation will be boosted by up to 2 percentage points over the 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
The government reported Tuesday that the first shock wave from the Persian Gulf 
had pushed consumer prices up by 0.8% in August and left inflation running at 
an annual rate of 6.2% so far this year, the fastest clip in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan was unwilling to tell lawmakers what the Fed intends to do regarding 
credit conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Fed "will seek higher, lower, or unchanged interest rates will 
depend on the specifics of the situation, which are shifting day by day," 
Greenspan said.

Water from the spring at Lourdes, one of the world's most famous shrines, is 
being rationed to pilgrims for the first time because of heavy consumption, 
officials announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the more than 4 million pilgrims who visit Lourdes each year were 
allowed to take away with them as much of the spring water as they could carry, 
spokesman Loic Bondu said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, visitors will be asked to take no more than one small 
container to ensure that enough water is available to refill the pools in which 
ailing pilgrims bathe, seeking a cure. Bondu said the pools require 3,960 
gallons of water a day. 
</P>
<P>
Lourdes, according to Roman Catholic tradition, is the site where the Virgin 
Mary appeared 18 times in five months before a poor, 14-year-old girl named 
Bernadette Soubirous in 1858.

ARMY SEIZES ARMS IN MOHAWK CLASH

The army today displayed about 50 weapons seized from a Mohawk reserve south of 
Montreal during a search that provoked the most violent clash yet between 
troops and natives in a 2 1/2-month-old standoff over a land dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Greg Mitchell, battalion commander for the Canadian army, said the 
weapons, including shotguns, rifles and handguns as well as walkie-talkies and 
camouflage uniforms, were found in about 10 caches on the Kahnawake reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"They were hidden away in plastic or duffel bags, under trees. The intent for 
their use was obviously illegal," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Police, soldiers and Mohawks at two Quebec reserves have been involved in a 
land dispute that began July 11 when Quebec officers stormed a barricade 
erected by natives around a proposed golf course they claimed was an ancient 
burial ground. One officer was killed in the raid at the Kanesatake reserve, 
south of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The search for weapons Tuesday at Kahnawake led to the worst clash yet between 
soldiers and Mohawks. In the resulting riot that lasted nearly seven hours, 
soldiers used three rounds of tear gas to restrain the crowd of about 300 
natives who tried to stop the search. 
</P>
<P>
Although the natives were equipped with only rocks, clubs and sticks, they 
almost overpowered the soldiers. According to Mitchell, 19 soldiers required 
medical treatment, including one with a broken hand.

GREECE TO TRY PALESTINIAN; REJECTS EXTRADITION TO U.S.

Greece will try a Palestinian accused of bombing an American airliner on murder 
charges, rejecting a U.S. extradition request, the Justice Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
A magistrate read four charges against Mohammed Rashid, 34, stemming from a 
midair bomb blast aboard a Pan American airliner in 1982 in which one person 
died and 15 were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The charges, ending more than two years of legal wrangling over whether Rashid 
would be extradited, were read during a one-hour meeting in his cell in the top 
security Korydallos prison in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
He was charged with premeditated murder, planting explosives on an airliner, 
causing an explosion and illegal activity on an airliner, defense lawyer Dafni 
Vagianou said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States wanted Rashid extradited for the attack on the Pan American 
airliner, which was flying from Tokyo to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Rashid, who says he is an officer in the Palestine Liberation Organization, was 
arrested at Athens airport in May, 1988, after a tip by American authorities. 
He denies involvement in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
Three Greek governments dodged the decision on extraditing Rashid. The United 
States warned that failure to hand over the Palestinian would strain relations 
and guerrilla groups warned of reprisals unless he was freed. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, whose conservative government took power 
in April and who has worked diligently to improve relations with Washington, 
rejected a September, 1989, Supreme Court recommendation that Rashid be 
extradited. 
</P>
<P>
Instead he will be tried under the 1971 Montreal Convention, permitting people 
charged with terrorist acts against airliners to stand trial in the country 
holding them. 
</P>
<P>
American officials have said the worst possible decision would be to try Rashid 
in Greece, which would anger both the United States and guerrilla groups.

carve Greek letters on his face.

Brent Baresh, 24, an inactive member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, told police 
he was attacked early Monday while jogging near the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely thought I was going to die," Baresh said. 
</P>
<P>
He told investigators the attackers pinned him to the ground and that one of 
them cut the letters of the fraternity onto his cheeks. "I smelled alcohol on 
his breath and didn't know what would happen next," Baresh said.

PRO-IRAQI MEDIA TELL STORIES OF U.S. SOLDIERS' DECADENCE

The pro-Iraqi media contends that American soldiers sent to Saudi Arabia are 
afflicted with all the manifestations of U.S. decadence, including AIDS, 
alcohol, drugs and a yearning for prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi people also are being told that Israel, far from being a peripheral 
player in the Persian Gulf crisis, has sent planes, tanks and soldiers to Saudi 
Arabia, all elaborately disguised as being part of the U.S. arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Information Agency analysis of the pro-Saddam Hussein media in Iraq and 
elsewhere says there has been an "extremely active" disinformation campaign 
waged against the United States and U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia since Iraq 
invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Although many Iraqi disinformation claims are crude and patently false, past 
experience with disinformation campaigns indicates that even the most 
outrageous claims can be widely believed," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Some examples of claims found in the Iraqi media or other sympathetic news 
outlets: 
</P>
<P>
* The Pentagon has arranged to send two groups of 5,000 Egyptian women each to 
provide for the "sexual satisfaction" of American servicemen in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. troops, 40% of whom are suffering from AIDS, are occupying and defiling 
Muslim holy places in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
* Some military planes in Saudi Arabia are actually Israeli planes disguised as 
U.S. aircraft. The Israeli pilots have been provided with U.S. identity cards. 
</P>
<P>
* Saudis resent the U.S. military presence in their country and have sabotaged 
U.S. military equipment. In response, U.S. forces have killed some Saudis. 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. forces are dumping nuclear waste in the Saudi desert.

MUSTANG RANCH'S NEW 'MADAM' ON BANKRUPTCY COURT'S PAYROLL

A federal bankruptcy trustee is the new "madam" at the Mustang Ranch, and she 
says she'll run the legal brothel "like any other business." 
</P>
<P>
But first, Jeri Coppa needs a staff, since the bordello's "working girls" left 
before federal officials closed it Tuesday because the owner, Joe Conforte, 
missed a payment on his tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I will run it like any other business, a bar or a store," Coppa said. "The 
point is, an operating business sells better than one that is shut down." 
</P>
<P>
Coppa acted as trustee for a bankrupt brothel near Fallon several years ago. It 
never sold and creditors eventually foreclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Conforte, apparently acting on advance notice the bankruptcy court intended to 
liquidate his business, had closed the bordello and sent his employees away 
before receiving formal notice. 
</P>
<P>
Coppa said the prostitutes are out on the street with nowhere to go and urged 
them to return to the 105-room Mustang Ranch, which is located about 12 miles 
east of Reno in Storey County, where brothels are legal under county law. 
</P>
<P>
Some customers who showed up at the ranch were surprised to find it closed. "I 
guess it's back to the opera," one man joked. 
</P>
<P>
Conforte's much-publicized attempts to sell the brothel through public stock 
offerings for about $23 million failed twice in recent years.

American Stores Co., the nation's largest grocery and drugstore retailer, said 
today it is exploring the sale of its Acme Markets Inc. unit, which operates 
275 supermarkets in the Northeast and had sales of $3.3 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company said proceeds from a sale would be used to reduce debt and for 
investment in technology, remodeling and new store programs in its remaining 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
American Stores had total debt of $3.4 billion at the end of its second 
quarter, a spokesman said. A large part of the debt was incurred in the 
$2.5-billion takeover of California's Lucky Stores chain in June, 1988, and for 
real estate purchases. 
</P>
<P>
American Stores operates a total of 1,895 food and drug stores in 38 states. 
Its subsidiaries include Jewel Food Stores, Skaggs Alpha Beta, Osco and Save-on

A small crowd of Soviet businessmen, struggling to master the art of 
Western-style market capitalism, began trading today at the first commodities 
exchange to open here since the Bolshevik Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
For two hours, about 200 businessmen representing cooperatives and state-owned 
enterprises bought and sold commodities ranging from construction materials to 
paint brushes and computer software. 
</P>
<P>
It was run like an auction. Two men perched on a podium shouted prices as the 
traders standing below timidly raised their hands to bid for the commodities. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to operate like the Chicago commodities exchange," said Gennady 
Poleshuk, co-chairman of the Moscow exchange. "But we are starting from the 
beginning. We are 200 years behind." 
</P>
<P>
Among the first items on the block were prestigious U.S.-made IBM computers 
that sold for tens of thousands of rubles. 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow exchange -- the boldest attempt yet to steer the country toward a 
market-driven system -- opened amid heated debate in the Soviet Parliament over 
a radical plan to transform the moribund economy and public pressure for the 
government to take drastic measures. 
</P>
<P>
Managers of state enterprises that exceed their production quotas are permitted 
to sell goods at the commodities exchange, while cooperatives are allowed to 
sell goods outright. 
</P>
<P>
"This exchange allows us to learn what prices the market will bear," said 
Alexander Belyaev, a cooperative owner. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Soviet Union, it is difficult to get information about prices. Here, 
the price is set according to what someone will pay for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange initially will operate once every two weeks and then open one day 
a week beginning in October, officials said. To engage in trading, participants 
are required to put up 100 rubles ($177).

More than 100,000 New Yorkers are sniffing around for 2,000 jobs as sanitation 
workers, smelling security in the city's mountains of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
It's a record turnout of applicants for any city job, officials said today, and 
at least one of them thinks he knows why.

"For somebody who likes the outdoors, it's a good, clean living," Sanitation 
Department spokesman Vito Turso said. "You can build up your muscles, and then 
get them tanned." 
</P>
<P>
The pay is $23,104 per year to start, with the salary climbing to $35,000 after 
five years. Add in overtime, and a likely raise with the next city contract, 
and it's obvious that garbage can be golden. The Sanitation Department also 
offers comprehensive benefits.

U.S. OIL IMPORTS UP 4.1% IN AUGUST;

<P>
U.S. petroleum imports rose 4.1% in August compared to a year ago, a leading 
industry group said today, in the first comprehensive look at the nation's oil 
supplies for the month in which Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion on Aug. 2 threw world oil markets into chaos, and fears of supply 
shortages sent crude prices skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute said in its monthly report that imports of 
crude oil and petroleum products rose to 8.88 million barrels per day in 
August, compared to 8.53 million barrels a day in August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The August imports were down slightly from July. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had said it would take more than a month for the trade sanctions 
against Iraq to start having a real impact on the nation's energy supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's stockpile of crude oil and petroleum products was up 2.9% from the 
previous August, at 1.1 billion barrels at the end of the month, API said. That 
was about the same as July. 
</P>
<P>
But by the end of August, crude prices had risen by between 70% and more than 
100% above their levels in mid June, API said. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices tumbled about $1 per barrel today in reaction to a separate API 
report that indicated the United States has a bigger supply of gasoline than 
futures traders had thought. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a large, unexpected build in gasoline stocks," said Ann-Louise 
Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly report, issued Tuesday night, showed that gasoline stocks were up to 
217 million barrels last week from 211.1 million barrels a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers pushed light sweet crude down $1.01 to $32.40 per barrel for 
October delivery in late morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Other crude contracts were also down as speculators sold futures in response to 
the API report.

The chief index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange sagged to its lowest close in 2 1/2 
years today, while the dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 158.65 points, or 0.66%, closing at 
23,726.17. It was the Nikkei's lowest finish since Feb. 9, 1988, when it ended 
trading at 23,662.27. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the closely watched index fell at one point to 23,308.31 before 
recovering in the afternoon to 23,884.82. 
</P>
<P>
Stock traders said investor pessimism -- spurred by uncertainty over the 
Mideast, inflation concerns and rising oil prices and interest rates -- was 
continuing to pull the market down.

The Buffalo Bills today waived fullback Larry Kinnebrew, their second-leading 
rusher last year, and re-signed punter Rick Tuten to shore up their kicking 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Tuten was released at the end of training camp when the team decided to go with 
rookie punter John Nies. 
</P>
<P>
But after Nies averaged 34.8 yards on five punts in Sunday's 30-7 loss at 
Miami, Coach Marv Levy announced he was giving serious thought to making a 
change at the position. 
</P>
<P>
Levy was not immediately available to explain why the team decided to make room 
for Tuten by releasing Kinnebrew, rather than Nies. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnebrew rushed for 533 yards on 131 carries last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
An intruder broke into the home of San Antonio Spurs guard David Wingate and 
left a sinister calling card -- a female doll pierced by needles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio police said they were called to Wingate's home shortly after noon 
Tuesday when a neighbor reported hearing an alarm go off. 
</P>
<P>
Wingate, 26, was jailed Monday in Columbia, Md., after he was charged with 
second-degree rape, battery and a fourth-degree sexual offense. He was freed on 
$10,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
He was accused of raping a 17-year-old female Sunday at a party at his Maryland 
apartment, court records state. Wingate told Howard County police he had sex 
with her but said it was with her consent. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio police said Tuesday that they found a message scrawled in lipstick 
on a mirror in a bathroom adjacent to the master bedroom in Wingate's home. 
Investigators did not say what the message was, but they did say they believe 
it was written by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police report, the doll had been left on a plate in "what 
appeared to be sugar or salt. The granulated substance was in the figure of a 
pentagram," the report stated.

2 GROUPS MAKE PITCH FOR BASEBALL FRANCHISES

Two decades after the Senators left Washington, two groups argued today before 
baseball owners that the nation's capital should be given a third try. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, Charlotte, N.C., Nashville, Tenn., and Orlando, Fla., appeared 
before the National League's expansion committee, vying for the two franchises 
that will start play in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Two groups came from Washington, one seeking a downtown team and another 
looking to put one in a northern Virginia suburb. 
</P>
<P>
While some prospective owners were well-informed, others knew little about 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Richard M. DeVos, head of the Orlando group and president of Amway Corp., and 
John E. Akridge, a real estate developer who leads the downtown Washington 
group, said they were not familiar with revenue participation, the key 
long-term plan of management's Player Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
When told of the plan, DeVos criticized it, saying "everyone wants to get into 
the act" and terming it "socialism." He apparently did not realize the proposal 
was made by owners, not by the players association. 
</P>
<P>
Akridge also said he was unaware of the plan, which is bitterly opposed by the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
Both Akridge and Mark W. Tracz, head of the suburban Washington group, said 
they would attempt to build their teams through farm systems. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to get into the free-agent spending situation," said Tracz, who 
owns a Class A minor-league team. 
</P>
<P>
Tracz's group said a team in the suburbs could be more successful than a 
downtown franchise because it would be farther from the American League's 
Baltimore Orioles. The other group wants to play in RFK Stadium, home of the 
Washington Redskins and former home of the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
The league will announce a "short list" of finalists by Dec. 31 and will select 
the new teams by Sept. 30, 1991.

OLYMPICS: THE CITY'S CAMPAIGN TO HOLD THE '96 GAMES BENEFITED FROM TV 
CONSIDERATIONS AND THE HELP OF THE NFL.

<P>
It began as the dream of a former University of Georgia football All-American 
named Billy Payne, who had just finished raising the money to build a new 
sanctuary for his church and was looking for something else to do. 
</P>
<P>
It became a two-year, $7-million crusade to win the 1996 Summer Olympics for 
Atlanta, a quest many thought improbable until the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, on a 51-35 fifth-ballot vote of the International Olympic Committee in 
Tokyo, it became a stark, stunning reality. Atlanta, the capital of the New 
South, is about to become the capital of the new Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
It is no secret that Atlanta earned it the old-fashioned way: with down-home 
hospitality, complete with violins at nearly every social function, and 
continuous visits around the world. 
</P>
<P>
It also won the 1996 Games because it is in the Eastern United States. That 
means a viewer-friendly time zone, which means more television money for the 
overflowing IOC coffers. 
</P>
<P>
And Atlanta just might have benefited from the subtle support of the National 
Football League. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Tuesday at a luncheon with 
writers and editors at the Washington Post that one reason the league placed 
the 1994 Super Bowl in Atlanta was to help the Olympics bid. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely part of our decision-making process that the Super Bowl 
would help them," Tagliabue said. "We spoke with the State Department, and they 
told us it would be a plus if a major U.S. sports organization gave Atlanta a 
vote of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
For the rights to televise the next three Olympics, U.S. networks will pay 
almost $1 billion. NBC is paying $401 million for the rights to the '92 Games 
in Barcelona, Spain. CBS is paying $243 million for the '92 Winter Games in 
Albertville, France, and $300 million for the '94 Winter Games in Lillehammer, 
Norway. The IOC receives about 10% of the money. 
</P>
<P>
All of this was not lost on the Atlanta Olympic hopefuls. In Tokyo, Atlanta 
circulated a brochure with a TV on the cover and trumpeted the possibility of 
"record revenue sources for the Olympic movement." 
</P>
<P>
There is no way to estimate how much more money the IOC will reap from holding 
the Games in Atlanta, but educated guesses are that it could be $100 million 
more than it would have been had the host city been outside North America. The 
TV bidding probably will take place in the fall of 1992, after the Barcelona 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the bidding will be considerably in excess of the $300 million of 
Seoul and the $400 million of Barcelona," said Robert Wussler, who heads the 
video entertainment unit of Comsat. "What happened in Los Angeles is ancient 
history now because there will be so many more opportunities coming out of 
Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
The Games are expected to be an economic windfall for Atlanta. The organizing 
committee figures that with private sponsorship and prudent management, the 
Games will turn a profit of $244 million, to be used to support amateur sports 
programs in Georgia. Another $200 million is expected in government revenues, 
and officials expect that money to go to programs for education, medical care 
and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Young, the committee chairman and former mayor, was asked in Tokyo 
whether American money was the key to the result. "We've got an expression in 
Georgia: 'That dog won't hunt,' " Young said. "There's no ground for that 
question, because after Los Angeles, any Olympics anywhere is going to come out 
all right financially. The major source of income now is television revenue, 
and that doesn't change because the host city is in America."

OLYMPIC COMMITTEE DID THE RIGHT THING BY CHOOSING ATLANTA

<P>
Quite simply, tradition would have carried too steep a price. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Atlanta, which started out pretty much as a sacrificial lamb a few years 
ago, ends up as the fatted calf. 
</P>
<P>
Picture it: President Bush, in the final year of his second term, stepping to 
the microphone and saying, "I declare open the Games of the 25th Olympiad." Cue 
the pigeons and balloons. 
</P>
<P>
It is July 20, 1996, no more than a week after the folks in Athens have cooled 
down about not being awarded the centenary celebration of the modern Games by 
the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the fact that Greece had lost any interest in the Olympics years ago. As 
the 100th anniversary year approached, it foresaw an economic windfall. So it 
wrapped up a bid in tradition, words like Olympic ideal and responsibility, and 
assumed the IOC would "do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
The runners-up in the balloting who complained that the "IOC was guided by the 
very thing it criticized during the entire campaign: profit" ought now review 
their own motives. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, a return to the birthplace of the modern Games, originally 
decreed by Frenchman Baron Pierre de Coubertin for sentimental reasons, would 
have been fine in theory, hugely impractical in attempts to carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
A severe lack of accommodations, deplorable transportation, advanced pollution 
problems and an alarming security record are a few of Athens' drawbacks. To 
help correct the problems, the country planned on using defense budget money. 
</P>
<P>
For a moneymaking venture with a specious set of values like the Olympics? 
What's Greek for "let them eat cake"? 
</P>
<P>
When bidding for the Olympics was first proposed by Atlantan Billy Payne just 
two years ago, many concluded that the guy had been kicked in the head once too 
often while playing defensive end at the University of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of the city's final presentation to the 92-member IOC, however, 
Atlanta assumed an aura of Camelot: Accommodations galore (65,000 hotel rooms 
by 1996). Great experience as the third-largest convention site in the country. 
Modern rapid transit. A smooth-functioning airport, second-busiest in the 
world. Headquarters of no less than nine Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
These things plus facilities, real and planned, marketing considerations and, 
in first place, television are the factors that dictate votes. As one voter 
pointed out, "Athens started the race one step ahead, but you can't award the 
Games with your heart." 
</P>
<P>
And it's likely to always be the case ever since Peter V. Ueberroth showed the 
august IOC how to turn a few bucks with his fabulously successful 1984 Games in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered -- the monumental challenge facing Athens -- the IOC 
showed an admirable tendency toward tradition by sticking with the capital of 
Greece through five ballots. Athens actually picked up support as the voting 
went on, with the city that received the least support dropping off each 
subsequent ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Now the losers can rail all they want about idealism slipping down the tubes as 
the IOC continues its lunge toward the big money, but considering where a 
goodly chunk of dough goes, their argument lacks conviction. 
</P>
<P>
As much TV money as the IOC keeps for operating expenses (8%) goes to 
developing countries to underwrite their involvement in the Games. Time was 
when the Olympics involved a couple of dozen teams, a fraction of the number 
(160) that showed up in Seoul, South Korea, to compete two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, all IOC members realize funds from the Olympic Program, a 
marketing arm that disperses about $175 million in profits between Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing probably working against Athens: The '92 Games are in Barcelona, 
there is a strong possibility that the "Peace Games" of 2000 will be in Berlin, 
and the IOC likes to alternate continents. And Europe has the next two Winter 
Olympics too. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction in Atlanta ran the gamut from a woman saying, "We have the Super Bowl 
in '94 and now this," to Mayor Maynard Jackson saying, "I feel like an 
exclamation point has been laid down in the history of our city." 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, it is quite a comeback from the day William Tecumseh 
Sherman trooped through on his March to the Sea.

Ugly giants and unsteady bridges are preying on Whitney Houston's mind these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old singer said she has spent the time since two consecutive No. 1 
albums making new friends, learning about business and trying to decipher her 
recurring dreams. 
</P>
<P>
In one, a statue turns into an ugly giant "8 or 9 feet tall, kind of 
discolored," she said in the October issue of Life magazine. "He's always 
running after me but never gets me." 
</P>
<P>
Another dream has her crossing the George Washington Bridge between her home 
state of New Jersey and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"The bridge starts swinging," Houston said. "It's raining and snowing and 
sleeting. It's so windy the bridge turns upside down. But I'm making it; I'm 
making it across. 
</P>
<P>
"And when I'm almost there, a hand reaches out for me. It's a man with white 
hair who says, 'He told me to come for you,' and lifts me up and puts me on the 
other side."

ANN MILLER REMAINS TIMELESS . . .

Thirty years ago, the joke circulating MGM studio went like this: 
</P>
<P>
"Too bad about Ann Miller." 
</P>
<P>
"Why? What happened to her?" 
</P>
<P>
"She fell down and broke her hair." 
</P>
<P>
The sophisticates used to deride Miller, with her lacquered hair, powdered face 
and sunshiny verve. But most of her detractors are dead or at the Motion 
Picture Country House, and Miller goes on. The gams are great, and the toes can 
still tap a mile a minute. 
</P>
<P>
She remains a Hollywood landmark at age -- well, it's best to let her tell it. 
</P>
<P>
"My story is kind of weird," she says. "I was discovered dancing up at Bal 
Tabarin, a theater-restaurant in San Francisco, when I was not quite 13 years 
old. I was very tall, and I had eyelashes and long fingernails, the whole 
thing. Lucille Ball and (vaudeville and radio comic) Benny Rubin saw me dancing 
one night. That was when Eleanor Powell was at her height. 
</P>
<P>
"RKO was looking for another dancer, and Lucy and Benny saw me doing this 
little machine-gun tap thing. They asked me if I'd like to take a test at RKO. 
Of course, my mother and I just jumped at the chance. They asked me how old I 
was, and I said 18. I had to say that; I was working at almost a nightclub in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed 18, literally, for five years. Unfortunately, RKO found out, and they 
demanded that I produce a birth certificate. My mother and father were 
divorced, and about the only good thing he did for me was to get a birth 
certificate -- he was an attorney -- that said I was the age I was supposed to 
be. That tacked five years on my age. 
</P>
<P>
"So now people say, 'My, she's got to be 70 years of age.' I'm 67. I wish I 
wasn't, but I am. But people say, 'She made her first film at RKO in 1936; 
she's gotta be 70-75.' I just say, 'OK, I'm 108. And I still dance.' " 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, she's been on the book-selling circuit, hawking the tome she 
wrote with Maxine Asher, "Tapping Into the Force." 
</P>
<P>
At her comfortable house in mid-Beverly Hills, she talked about the reasons for 
her second book (the first was a 1972 autobiography, "Miller's High Life"). 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to write it since Shirley MacLaine had such huge success with her 
books and her videos," Miller said. "I thought, 'She's opened the door, and I 
might as well walk through it.' 
</P>
<P>
"My book is different from hers. I'm very clairvoyant. Shirley is not 
clairvoyant; she was just involved with meeting clairvoyants and getting from 
them the experiences that made her books so wonderful. I've had some amazing 
clairvoyant experiences." 
</P>
<P>
She related a few. When her father came home late one night, he claimed a 
business meeting. Ann, then 3 or 4, corrected him: "Dad, you were having dinner 
with that pretty, blond lady." End of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
About her psychic sense: "I can't turn it on, like professional clairvoyants. 
Mine is an inner voice that comes to me -- unlike the audible voice in 'Field 
of Dreams.' When that voice comes to me, I always listen, because it will save 
me from something dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Miller married three millionaires. All were unhappy experiences. Didn't her 
voice warn her? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but I wouldn't listen because I was in love. Love does strange things to 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Miller was born Lucille Ann Collier in Cherino, Tex. She began dancing at age 5 
to strengthen her legs after rickets. After her parents divorced, she and her 
mother moved to Los Angeles, where Ann won a talent contest that led to the San 
Francisco engagement. 
</P>
<P>
Her first speaking part came in 1937 with "Stage Door," in a cast that included 
Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Lucille Ball and Eve Arden. She primarily 
appeared in B musicals at RKO and then Columbia Pictures. Her glory years came 
at MGM. 
</P>
<P>
"My dear friend, Cyd Charisse, fell and broke her leg, and I was tested among 
other girls for a role in 'Easter Parade' with Fred Astaire. I won the part. 
That picture is what got me the contract at MGM where I stayed 12 years. That 
was like being in the 'Ziegfeld Follies.' It was so fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
After the MGM musical era ended, she danced on television and on Broadway in 
"Mame." She teamed with Mickey Rooney in a hokey revue, "Sugar Babies," that 
lasted 8 1/2 years in New York, on the road and London. It made both stars 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Sugar Babies' brought me the financial freedom that I needed," Miller 
reflected, "and it brought me the stardom that I needed. At MGM I always played 
the second feminine lead; I was never the star in films. I was the brassy, 
good-hearted showgirl. I never really had my big moment on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Sugar Babies' and 'Mame' gave me the stardom that my soul kind of yearned 
for."

Crystal Gayle may cut her famous ankle-length hair because it can be a pain in 
the neck. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure from her hair's extreme length gives her headaches and neck aches, the 
country-western singing star said before performing with her sister, Loretta 
Lynn, Tuesday at the Tulare County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
It also takes an extraordinarily long time to wash and dry -- five hours before 
her performance Tuesday. She lets her hair dry naturally instead of using an 
electric blow-dryer. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part is combing it out," said the singer. 
</P>
<P>
Her hair was down to the ground for her performance, but she had it up earlier 
in the day for convenience. 
</P>
<P>
"It was catching on every knob in the trailer," Gayle said. "It's like wearing 
a gown."
