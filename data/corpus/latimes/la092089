JOHN MCSHAIN; DEVELOPER WHO BUILT PENTAGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John McShain, the developer, hotel magnate and contractor who built some of the 
most significant public buildings in the country including the Pentagon, the 
State Department Building and the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, has died of 
a stroke at his retirement estate in Killarney, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
He was 90 when he died Sept. 9, it was learned this week. 
</P>
<P>
His company, John McShain Inc., one of the largest construction firms in the 
United States in the 1940s, was headquartered in Philadelphia where he built 
the Philadelphia International Airport, the Naval Hospital, state and municipal 
buildings, a Holiday Inn and many churches and college facilities. Better known 
to visitors may be the Barclay Hotel where he also lived until retiring in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
Although a lifelong Republican, he was invited by President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt in 1939 to build the Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
He also worked on the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and helped 
renovate the White House during the Administration of Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
Late in life, McShain began racing thoroughbreds in various tracks in the 
United States and Europe. Among the horses he produced through his Barclay 
Stables was Ballymoss, Europe's champion horse of 1958, which won the Irish 
Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, France's premier race. His filly 
Gladness won the Ascot Gold Cup in England that same year. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife and a daughter.

This could be the worst insult yet aimed at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Alien Nation," a new television series set in 1995, revolves around the lives 
of some extraterrestrials who land in the Mojave Desert and, naturally, move to 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Their hairless heads are shaped like overripe melons and adorned with red 
squiggles. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the show, a disclaimer says that "any similarity to persons 
living or dead" is "purely coincidental." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of extraterrestrial communities, the Venice Chamber of Commerce 
unveiled a new logo Tuesday, replacing the old image of a gondolier plying the 
canal waters. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted something more representative of Venice today," a chamber spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Venice today? What a great straight line! How about a turbaned weightlifter 
juggling a chain saw and roller-skating down the boardwalk while his faithful 
snake slithers along at his side? 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the new logo is more corporate than colorful -- merely Venice spelled out 
in various type styles. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the name is underlined by a squiggle that's suspiciously similar to 
the type found on the heads of the "Alien Nation" characters. 
</P>
<P>
A recent mention of the inclusion of L.A.'s Bullwinkle-and-Rocky statue in the 
book, "Roadside America," prompted a couple of letters that reveal the origin 
of the 30-year-old landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Publicist Goldy Norton fondly recalls passing the Sunset Boulevard sculpture of 
the cartoon stars in the late 1950s on "my frequent walks to the dearly 
departed Plush Pup hot dog stand or Schwab's Drugstore." 
</P>
<P>
The statue, Norton says, was inspired by "a Sahara Hotel billboard on the north 
side of Sunset, which was topped by a larger-than-life statue of a showgirl on 
a rotating base. When Jay Ward, the genius behind Bullwinkle, built his 
headquarters across the street, he decided a comparable statue . . . would be 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
And why is Bullwinkle holding Rocky in the palm of his hand? 
</P>
<P>
Attorney John Hamilton Scott, whose father Bill Scott was the voice of 
Bullwinkle, says that the showgirl was "holding a cowboy hat in her 
outstretched arm. The Bullwinkle statue was a mordant comment." 
</P>
<P>
This sounds like a joke but isn't. The theater chain Cineplex Odeon, which 
offers such delicacies as designer water and capuccino, now accepts American 
Express cards. And, why not? Tickets now go for $7 a pop. The chain so far has 
no plans to issue its own credit cards. You know -- Cineplastic. 
</P>
<P>
The family sport of the future? Forget about bowling, tennis and miniature 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
Verne Langdon believes it's only a matter of time before Dad and Junior are 
grappling in the ring. How about best two out of three falls to see who does 
the dishes? 
</P>
<P>
Langdon is the creator of Slammers, a new Sun Valley attraction that bills 
itself as "L.A.'s only wrestling gym for the entire family." 
</P>
<P>
He claims wrestling "is great exercise," especially if low-impact aerobics 
doesn't inflict enough pain on your body. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-foot-by-17-foot ring rents for $35 an hour, a rate that might offend the 
Andre the Accountant in your family. But Langdon points out you can have the 
whole family in there bouncing off the ropes at once -- a Battle Royal! 
</P>
<P>
Another contribution from the local car culture: PCH (Pacific Coast Highway), a 
line of swimwear named after a roadway.

Attention Beverly Hills Visitors Bureau: Your letter, which arrived here even

UNITING DIVERSE LATINO GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank del Olmo's column ("Cuban in Congress Spells End of Hispanic," Op-Ed 
Page, Sept. 5) on everything that's wrong with the term "Hispanic" to denote 
Chicanos, Puerto Ricans, Cubans and others of Spanish heritage reminded me of a 
story I learned while still in my native Cuba: 
</P>
<P>
Two donkeys were tied to each other by a very short rope. There were two bales 
of hay at opposite ends of the field where they grazed, and the donkeys were 
tugging at each other, trying to get to the opposite bales of hay. After some 
wasted effort, the donkeys sat down in frustration. Then they had a bright 
idea. They both went to one of the bales of hay and shared it. When finished, 
they both went to the other bale and shared it. The title of the story is 
"Unidos Venceremos," which not too loosely translated means "united we stand," 
and by implication, divided we fall. 
</P>
<P>
While I agree with Del Olmo that the historical experience of each Hispanic 
group in this country has been different, I submit that we should emphasize our 
similarities, and revel in our differences. Hispanics are not just a political 
interest group, sharing only a single belief. Hispanics share a language and a 
complex heritage colored by our own regional distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that like Del Olmo, I disagree with many of the political positions 
taken by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the Cuban American election to Congress from the 
Miami area. However, I find I am proud she was elected. Proud, not just because 
she's a woman in what has been a male domain, but because she is Hispanic. We 
also need to keep in mind that her election to Congress is presumably a 
reflection of the political beliefs of those constituents who got her elected 
-- something that doesn't happen in many of the countries Hispanics originally 
hailed from.

I dislike the term "Hispanic." Not only does it connote a non-existent unity, 
but more importantly it goes against the principle of self-determination. It is 
a government-concocted word that undermines the hard work of Chicano activists 
of the 1960s and 1970s. Let us not forget that at the very heart of the word 
Chicano was the belief that Mexican Americans should define for themselves who 
they were and what they should pursue. 
</P>
<P>
The term "Chicano" came about as a reaction against being considered hyphenated 
Americans (as in Mexican-American) which in reality meant second-class 
citizens. Yes, the hyphen has disappeared but in its place has come a new word 
that reinforces and perpetuates the fact that Chicanos/Latinos/Mexicanos still 
have no say over their own destiny.

HELPING HAND FOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neighborhood groups are learning to build affordable housing that Washington 
once paid for. But it takes more than 2-by-4s, nails and stucco. Novices need 
to know the housing business from the ground up. A nonprofit organization, best 
known for raising private capital to finance low-income housing, is beginning 
to help there as well, with technical training designed to teach the novices 
how to think like developers. 
</P>
<P>
The Local Initiatives Support Corp. teaches participants during four weeklong 
training sessions spread over a year how to acquire a building site, get into 
escrow, find financing, review construction budgets and close deals. Step by 
step, neighborhood groups learn from start to finish what it takes to put up 
housing. They also are taught never to lose sight of the people who will live 
in the new apartments, so that they build housing that poor people can be proud 
of. 
</P>
<P>
The first training program, which ended last week, cost $250,000 and was 
underwritten by the ARCO Foundation, the California Community Foundation, the 
James Irvine Foundation and the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation. The Los Angeles 
Community Design Center provided technicalassistance. The 14 participants also 
received grants of $12,500 to help with start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
Ten graduates are already putting their new skills to work in South-Central Los 
Angeles, East Los Angeles, Little Tokyo, San Pedro, the Westside and Skid Row. 
They are starting to develop apartments for poor families, group housing for 
mentally ill adults, single-room occupancy hotels for homeless men and women 
and senior citizens' housing. The 455 new units are expected to provide homes 
for about 1,500 low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
The new housing, although a drop in the bucket compared to the region's needs, 
is essential because of federal indifference to the housing needs of poor 
Americans. The massive housing cutbacks during the Reagan Administration 
demonstrated a contempt for poor Americans who are ill-housed or homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Community organizations can't singlehandedlyfill the housing gap in Los 
Angeles, where an estimated 500,000 families need better and more affordable 
housing. But at least local organizations, with training and encouragement from 
the Local Initiatives Support Corp., can make the affordable housing picture 
less bleak than it is today.

SALVADOR PEACE GLIMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rebels who are at war with the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador have 
drawn up a serious peace proposal that could end the fighting. But it can 
succeed only if President Alfredo Cristiani, El Salvador's military leaders and 
the United States are just as serious. 
</P>
<P>
The peace plan was made public last week by officials of the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front (FMLN) who met in Mexico City with delegates sent by 
Cristiani, the right-wing politician elected to head El Salvador's government 
in June. The mere fact that representatives of the two most extreme political 
factions in El Salvador would even sit down and talk was a hopeful sign. So it 
is more encouraging that three days of meetings in the Mexican capital resulted 
in an agreement to begin peace negotiations next month in Costa Rica. The joint 
communique issued by the two sides said the peace talks would aim to end the 
10-year-old civil war "by political means in the shortest possible time." 
</P>
<P>
That optimistic tone was possible only because the FMLN delegation, which 
included two of the rebel coalition's top guerrilla commanders, made a specific 
offer to stop the fighting by early next year if the government agrees to a 
series of specific reforms in El Salvador. The rebels said they would agree to 
a cease fire on Nov. 15, and to demobilization of their fighting units by Jan. 
31, 1990, if the government agrees to a sweeping overhaul of the country's 
justice system and military. Rebel spokesmen also offered to transform their 
movement into a political party and try to achieve power peacefully, if the 
government agreed to advance the date of elections now scheduled for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the FMLN's peace offer, it would be naive to expect a quick or easy 
end to 10 years of bloodshed in El Salvador. Once the peace talks begin, it is 
likely they will be long and difficult. Even as the government delegates were 
leaving Mexico City on an upbeat note, spokesmen for two groups back in El 
Salvador that could easily sabotage the talks were criticizing the FMLN peace 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
An official of Cristiani's Arena party dismissed the request for early 
elections as "beyond consideration." So the first test of the new president's 
political clout, a power that many analysts feel is quite limited, will turn on 
whether he can persuade his political allies to give peace a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Even more worrisome, a Defense Ministry spokesman said the nation's 60,000-man 
army would not be reduced as long as Marxism remains a threat to "the nation 
and the Central American region." In some extreme cases, El Salvador's military 
caste equates Jesuit priests with Marxist subversion. That rather paranoid 
notion of national security is grounds for wondering whether the Salvadoran 
high command will ever agree to demobilize the manpower and firepower it has 
amassed with more than $1 billion worth of U.S. aid. The military was the 
single most powerful, and corrupt, institution in El Salvador when the civil 
war began in 1979. While it has become somewhat more professional under U.S. 
tutelage, it is also more powerful than ever before. No peace plan will work in 
El Salvador unless the generals and colonels support it. And they are unlikely 
to cooperate unless their North American paymasters insist on it. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels know that. That is why their peace plan -- and the public-relations 
offensive that accompanied it -- was aimed as much at the Bush Administration 
and Congress as at public opinion in El Salvador. This became even clearer 
after the Mexico City talks, when the rebels' leading field commander, Joaquin 
Villalobos, granted a rare interview to the New York Times in an effort to 
present a reasonable, moderate face to the United States. Described by some as 
a rigid Marxist, Villalobos said he favors political and economic pluralism in 
El Salvador and peaceful coexistence with the United States. He also admitted 
that the rebels have made mistakes in their effort to defeat the government, 
including assassinating political rivals and using terrorism and sabotage as 
routine tactics. 
</P>
<P>
There are undoubtedly many people in Washington, and certainly in San Salvador, 
who don't believe Villalobos. But there is no way to be sure he and other FMLN 
leaders are not sincere without putting them to the test. And that will happen 
only if the Cristiani government comes to the peace talks with specific 
counterproposals to the rebel peace plan.

ARMENIAN QUAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
I must applaud the work of your Moscow Bureau chief, Michael Parks, in his 
effort to keep readers up to date on the progress of the reconstruction efforts 
in earthquake devastated Armenia (Part I, Sept. 5). 
</P>
<P>
Although the reconstruction continues, it is at a snail's pace. The longer this 
effort takes the larger the impact on the psyche of the 1/2 million homeless 
survivors, poetically described as "refugees in their own land." This is why 
the Earthquake Relief Fund for Armenia (ERFA) has made it its priority to see 
to the mental well-being of the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, ERFA has dispatched seven groups of mental health specialists 
under the direction of Dr. Armen Goenjian and Dr. Sarkis Arevian. Focusing 
their efforts on the children of the earthquake, these teams have serviced over 
3,000 patients. In addition, they have held numerous seminars and conferences 
to teach their techniques to local professionals.

STEPS LIMITING SOVIET FORCES WOULD REASSURE REFORMERS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
The Warsaw Pact, it is commonly observed, is the only alliance in history whose 
military forces have been used solely to invade its own members. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt this is why Poland's new Solidarity-led government has taken pains to 
reassure Moscow that it will not withdraw from the pact. It also explains why 
Solidarity promptly yielded the defense and interior ministries to the 
Communist Party: Reform in Eastern Europe cannot exceed the Soviet Union's 
tolerance for change, a lesson imprinted on the memories of Hungarians and 
Czechoslovakians whose hopes were dashed under the treads of Soviet tanks in 
1956 and 1968. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Warsaw Pact's past suppression of reform also reveals an 
opportunity to be grasped in the ongoing conventional force reduction talks, 
the third round of which commenced in Vienna earlier this month. Those 
negotiations are designed to reduce the threat posed to the West by the Warsaw 
Pact. However, the talks can also be utilized to reduce the threat that the 
Warsaw Pact poses to its own members. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the Vienna talks could be used to reduce and restrict Soviet 
forces in Eastern Europe so as to limit Moscow's ability to pressure East Bloc 
governments that experiment with democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, no conventional arms-control agreement can neutralize the Soviet 
Union's inherent geographic advantage when it comes to moving forces across its 
borders to Budapest, Prague or Warsaw. Still, in an era when Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is attempting to persuade the West of his "new thinking" 
(not to mention his desire for Western credits and technology), 
across-the-border invasion is no longer an attractive option for the Soviets. 
Indeed, the unambiguous suppression of political dissent in, say, Warsaw would 
undermine Gorbachev's policy of glasnost in Moscow. His credibility, his 
program and thus his leadership would be a likely casualty of such an attack. 
</P>
<P>
If Moscow wishes to place pressure on a neighbor, then indirect aggression -- 
e.g., "military exercises" by Warsaw Pact troops already stationed in Eastern 
Europe -- is a more subtle and thus a more viable option. The more ambiguous 
the aggression, the less liable it is to provoke a major Western response. 
Contrast the worldwide condemnation of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 
December, 1979, (open aggression) with Europe's muted response to the more 
ambiguous Soviet troop mobilization on the Polish border in 1981 to pressure 
the Warsaw government to crack down on Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, the reduction and restriction of Soviet forces in Eastern Europe 
eliminates Soviet options, leaving Moscow with the undesirable alternatives of 
invasion or acquiescence. Advance notice of, and time limits on, military 
exercises in Eastern Europe could further restrict Soviet options. 
</P>
<P>
But how can the West encourage force reductions that limit Soviet options? By 
placing the public relations spotlight on the conventional force reduction 
talks, just as Gorbachev previously focused world attention on the 
intermediate-range nuclear missile talks, which ultimately resulted in an 
agreement during President Ronald Reagan's second term. The Soviet leader 
maintained world attention on the negotiations until the political need to 
reach an agreement was irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's conventional arms-control proposal to reduce U.S. armed forces 
in Europe by 20% (if the Soviets do the same) was a step in the right 
direction. The dramatic gesture, made last May in Brussels, focused attention 
on the talks. Further, by offering to reduce U.S. forces, the President 
symbolically demonstrated to Europeans his peaceful intentions and challenged 
the Soviets to match them. By requiring that an agreement on conventional arms 
reductions be implemented before talks on European-based, short-range nuclear 
missiles were commenced, the President gave the Soviets an incentive to consent 
to the West's conventional arms proposals. The Soviets have long placed greater 
priority on reducing European-based nuclear weapons, the elimination of which 
would make Europe more vulnerable to the Warsaw Pact's numerical superiority in 
conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the West German public is impatient with any delay in commencing 
talks on battlefield nuclear weapons. President Bush temporarily smoothed over 
the simmering dispute by proposing that the conventional arms reduction talks 
be completed in a year, thus giving Bonn hope of early nuclear weapon-reduction 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
But this only emphasizes that Eastern Europe's future is just as dependent on 
Western will as it is on Soviet tolerance. The path to Eastern Eurpean 
self-determination may very well begin in Bonn and lead to Vienna so that it 
can bypass Moscow.

RING THE ENVIRONMENTAL ALARMS; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION WOULD ERODE CITIZENS' ABILITY TO DEFEND FORESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANCIS M. WHEAT, Francis M. Wheat is a Los Angeles lawyer and a trustee of 
the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund.

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Senate, urged by Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) and Brock Adams, (D-Wash.) 
has adopted an alarming piece of legislation. In a nutshell, the measure would 
repeal, for parts of the Pacific Northwest, the federal environmental laws that 
govern the use of lands belonging to the American people. 
</P>
<P>
The mechanism for this is a rider attached by the sponsoring senators to the 
annual appropriations bill of the Interior Department that effectively exempts 
current timber sales from 13 national forests and other federal lands in the 
Northwest from every national law that protects the environment. The rider was 
passed without public hearing, without public testimony, without any 
consideration by the congressional committees that are supposed to watch over 
management of our national resources. 
</P>
<P>
The wording of the rider makes it appear less significant than it really is, 
saying merely that courts may not issue injunctions against logging operations 
until there has been a full hearing on the objection before the court. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if interested citizens' groups present evidence that a federal agency's 
logging plans violate laws enacted to protect the environment, the court's 
traditional authority to stop the violation pending a full hearing is removed. 
As a practical matter, the logging goes forward and later, when a full hearing 
is possible, it's too late. The Hatfield-Adams rider is, plainly and simply, a 
license to violate the law. 
</P>
<P>
Recent actions by three federal judges spurred the introduction of the 
Hatfield-Adams rider. In separate cases, all brought by citizen environmental 
groups, the judges ruled that sales of old-growth timber from much of the 
federal land in the Northwest appeared to be illegal. The cases dealt with 
logging in the last of the Northwest's ancient forests -- trees up to 1,000 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
Similar riders have passed before. In fact, since 1985, Hatfield has succeeded 
in getting six such measures through Congress, largely unnoticed by his 
colleagues. On Sept. 6, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on an 
appropriations bill rider authored by Hatfield in 1987. A lower court found 
that the Bureau of Land Management had acted "arbitrarily and capriciously" in 
disregarding "new, significant and probably accurate" information concerning 
the potential extinction of the northern spotted owl on BLM lands, in violation 
of the National Environmental Policy Act. But the appeals court confirmed that, 
under the 1987 Hatfield rider, timber sales may not be challenged with claims 
of new information about environmental impact, depriving citizens of another 
piece of their right to ask the courts to enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Interior Department appropriations bill, with the Hatfield-Adams 
rider, is about to go before a House-Senate conference committee. The measure 
must be seen by the conferees for what it is -- a dangerous infringement on the 
right of citizens to bring before the courts violations of laws by government 
agencies. A large measure of the enforcement of our environmental laws has come 
through suits by citizens and citizen groups. Continued restrictions on 
judicial review could bar citizens from challenging failure to enforce any 
number of laws -- those that protect our air, our water or our food, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
With the disaster of Prince William Sound fresh in mind, we may find a useful 
lesson in the battle fought some years ago over the trans-Alaska pipeline. The 
pipeline, from Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope to the port of Valdez on Prince 
William Sound, was challenged in court in the 1970s. Conservationists 
attempted, among other things, to get the Interior Department to prepare an 
unbiased environmental impact statement that carefully assessed the risks of 
transporting North Slope oil by sea through Prince William Sound. The 
conservation organizations wanted such risks compared to the alternative of 
using an all-land pipeline route through Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Pushed by the industry, which greatly preferred a pipeline to Valdez and then 
transshipment of the oil by tanker, Congress exempted the project from the 
National Environmental Policy Act and prohibited the courts from reviewing it 
under any law. Thus, by a single stroke, Congress took citizens and the courts 
out of the pipeline decision, leaving it entirely in the hands of federal 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
No one can say whether the legal review urged by the conservationists would 
have resulted in the pipeline being built through Canada. However, had it been 
built overland, as conservationists preferred, Prince William Sound would not 
have suffered the disaster that occurred March 24. 
</P>
<P>
The Alaska pipeline decision illustrates the risks to the environment when 
Congress is persuaded to exempt a particular project -- or an entire region -- 
from environmental laws that apply everywhere else. When Congress 
short-circuits the orderly judicial process for testing the soundness of 
potentially harmful acts, as the ancient-forest rider would do, the nation may 
lose more in the long run than is gained in the short term. If logging what 
little is left of the old-growth timber on public lands in the Pacific 
Northwest cannot withstand application by impartial judges of the National 
Forest Management Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Water 
Act and other environmental statutes, one wonders what sorts of activities 
Congress is being asked to put beyond the reach of the law.

AMERICA'S CUP IS SENT BACK TO S.D.; 
</P>
<P>
DECISION THAT GAVE YACHTING TROPHY TO KIWIS OVERTURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An appeals court in New York fired a torpedo into New Zealand's claim on the 
America's Cup Tuesday, returning sailing's most coveted trophy to the San Diego 
Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court voted 4 to 1 after 3 1/2 
months of deliberations that San Diego's 60-foot catamaran was a legal defender 
when Dennis Conner sailed it to two easy victories over New Zealand's 130-foot 
monohull boat last September. That reversed a March 28 ruling by New York 
Supreme Court Judge Carmen Ciparick, who had awarded the Cup to New Zealand's 
Mercury Bay Boating Club. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ruling was almost as lopsided as those races, which Conner won by 2 
1/2 and 4 1/2 miles. Although Conner sailed cautiously, the margins were great 
enough to give substance to a claim by New Zealand syndicate chief Michael Fay 
that the races were a mismatch and contradicted the spirit and letter of the 
19th-Century Deed of Gift that governs Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ciparick agreed, shocking the sailing world with her bold decision. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Ciparick's ruling has been overturned, however, Fay said he intends to 
pursue his case to the next and last station: the New York Court of Appeals. 
Since the Cup is held as a charitable trust by the state of New York, it is an 
inappropriate issue for the Supreme Court of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could go to the U.S. Supreme Court, I think I would," Fay said in a 
satellite TV interview from his high-rise office in Auckland, overlooking the 
bay where the races would have been in 1992. "New Zealand's resolve is as 
strong as ever. Perhaps our confidence is shaken just at this moment. Our 
determination hasn't changed. You won't see New Zealand giving up on the 
America's Cup, either now or in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Fay felt he was double-crossed when San Diego answered his challenge with a 
catamaran -- inherently, a much faster boat than a monohull. The merchant 
banker said he has already ordered his American lawyers in New York to move on 
an appeal. If the ruling Tuesday had been 3-2, one would automatically be 
granted, but since it was 4-1, he must petition the Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mark Smith of the San Diego law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins, 
which represents the San Diego Yacht Club, only two of the seven judges on the 
Court of Appeals must agree to grant an appeal -- "but the statistics are that 
in 1988 they granted less than 15% of the requests," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
George Tompkins Jr., who represents Fay, said the request for an appeal must be 
filed within 30 days but agreed with Smith that it has "a one in 10 chance" of 
being heard. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Ehman, executive vice president of the America's Cup Organizing Committee, 
said: "This decision makes an appeal by Michael Fay very unlikely, meaning that 
it's very likely that the defense of America's Cup 28 (the 28th race) will 
occur right here in San Diego, where it should have been all along." 
</P>
<P>
Francis Radford, vice commodore of the San Diego Yacht Club, said he thinks 
Mercury Bay's chances of winning on appeal are "slim and none." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Yacht Club Commodore Patrick Goddard was said to be in Britain on 
business but plans to retrieve the Cup in New York on his way home this week. 
During the appeal process, it was temporarily restored to the custody of the 
New York Yacht Club, which placed it in a vault at the Morgan Guaranty Trust 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
If Tuesday's ruling stands, Fay will be forced to return to San Diego as a 
challenger in 1992, the same role in which he first plunged into the fierce 
world of Cup competition at Fremantle, Western Australia, in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's America's Cup Organizing Committee has received 24 challenges from 
11 countries, including the Soviet Union, Japan and others that would be 
competing for the first time. Eliminations for defenders and challengers are 
scheduled to start in January, 1992, with the finalists meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
Only two Americans have indicated they will compete for the right to defend the 
Cup: Conner and Peter Isler, who was Conner's navigator at Fremantle. Ehman 
said he intends to meet soon with other potential American challengers to 
encourage participation and strengthen the defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the challengers are already building boats," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The drawback to most of the American syndicates is that they would be forced to 
defend the Cup not for their home yacht clubs but for the San Diego Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the New York judges -- Joseph P. Sullivan, E. Leo Molinas and Richard 
W. Wallach -- based Tuesday's decision on a different interpretation than 
Ciparick had given to the Deed of Gift, which was written by Cup donor George 
L. Schuyler Jr. in 1887. A fourth judge, Israel Rubin, also voted to overturn 
Ciparick but for different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, the presiding judge, wrote in the 49-page opinion: "The Deed of Gift 
is silent as to the type of boat to be used by the defender . . . (and) does 
not specifically bar the use of a multihulled vessel . . . nor is there any 
express mandate that the competing vessels be identical or even substantially 
similar." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Sullivan wrote, "In finding that the vessels must be 'somewhat evenly 
matched,' the court (Ciparick) promulgated a rule that is neither expressed in, 
nor inferable from, the language of the Deed of Gift." 
</P>
<P>
Fay had based part of his case on sportsmanship, which is addressed in the deed 
only in referring to the purpose of the Cup as "friendly competition among 
foreign countries." The judges differed on that point, also. 
</P>
<P>
The lone dissenting opinion by Judge Bentley Kassal was that "the 1988 
America's Cup races were manifestly unfair in every sense." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin's separate opinion contained rambling references to hockey and fox 
hunting, but conceded that "Stars &amp; Stripes' victory was virtually ensured 
. . . (but) I cannot agree with the proposition that the America's Cup 
competition is now, if it ever was, a paradigm of good sportsmanship." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan also wrote: "This language . . . imposes no affirmative obligation on 
the trustee to use any particular type of vessel . . . (and) if any inference 
is to be drawn, it would be that the donor intended to afford the defender a 
limited initial advantage. . . . Other than a waterline length limitation, the 
Deed does not contain any design constraints." 
</P>
<P>
Fay said: "If the majority ruling of the judges was to stand, then the defender 
has a built-in, unbeatable advantage . . . guaranteed to beat the (challenger). 
This majority ruling is a disgrace to sport. The America's Cup has no future . 
. . if these are the rules that govern the competition." 
</P>
<P>
Several prospective competitors, including San Diego and New Zealand, signed a 
protocol written at San Diego last year that they would refrain from pulling 
such shenanigans in future Cups and everybody would sail similar boats -- a new 
"America's Cup" class of monohulls larger and faster than the 12-meter yachts 
used since World War II. But Fay doesn't trust the San Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego might say to the next challenger, 'We won't sail a catamaran,' but 
what is to stop them?" he said. "The challenger is powerless to do anything 
about it. This opinion has given them the power to do anything to ensure the 
event is fixed in their favor." 
</P>

64% OF DWP'S CUSTOMERS STEER CLEAR OF TAP WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a stinging vote of no-confidence, nearly two-thirds of Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power customers use bottled water or water filtration 
devices instead of drinking straight from the tap, a recent DWP customer survey 
found. 
</P>
<P>
A companion survey found that DWP employees are almost as likely as customers 
to use bottled or filtered water. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California has long been the country's top bottled water market, but 
the findings show more distrust of tap water than previous surveys, apparently 
reflecting growing fears of toxic pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four percent of the customers who said they used bottled or filtered 
water said they did so for better taste, but 40% said they did for safety 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Possibly the most distressing result seen in this survey is the fact that 
bottled water use is on the rise," the report said. "Both bottled water and 
(filtered water) are considered by users to be better tasting and safer than 
DWP-supplied water." 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials said they were disturbed but not completely surprised by the 
findings, given the intense publicity about toxic hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just fighting an uphill battle to try to get out the correct information 
about the water supply," said Dan Waters, DWP assistant general manager for 
external and organizational services. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP provides water and electric power to the more than 3.3 million 
residents of the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that fewer customers today believe that Los Angeles water 
meets all state and federal standards than in 1987, when the DWP conducted a 
similar survey. Sixty-three percent then thought that all standards were being 
met, but that number has dwindled to 54%, with 24% now believing that the water 
does not meet standards and the rest saying that they are unsure. 
</P>
<P>
The findings also indicated that customers were nearly three times as likely to 
believe that contaminated ground water is a problem than to believe that it is 
not. Fifty-seven percent said contaminated ground water is a problem and 20% 
said it is not. 
</P>
<P>
The president of a bottled water trade group estimated that one of every two 
Southern Californians is "into some sort of tap water alternative." Told of the 
DWP findings, Douglas Nelson of the International Bottled Water Assn. said they 
reflect the "highest incidence in the country" of bottled and filtered water 
use. 
</P>
<P>
The customer survey found that 53% use bottled water, paying an average of 
$14.40 per month -- or about 800 times more per gallon than DWP water costs. 
Nineteen percent used water filters. Because some use both bottled water and 
filtration units, the total number who said they rely on alternate drinking 
water sources was 64%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survey of Employees 
</P>
<P>
Among DWP employees, 59% said they use alternate drinking water sources -- with 
49% using bottled water and 18% using home filter units. 
</P>
<P>
The survey included employees living in Los Angeles and served by the DWP and 
those living elsewhere and served by different water systems. 
</P>
<P>
But there were no significant differences between employees who were DWP 
customers and employees who were not in their use of bottled and filtered 
water, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
Waters said the trend is understandable in light of publicity about toxic 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"For every person that hears something about the water meeting all the 
standards . . . they read eight stories about water-contamination problems 
somewhere in the country," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of that publicity has been about chemical contamination of DWP wells in 
the San Fernando Valley that supply about one-sixth of the city's water. 
</P>
<P>
Polluted wells have been idled or are being blended with clean supplies, with 
the result that DWP's water meets all state and federal health standards, 
according to officials of the California Department of Health Services and the 
DWP. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Safety Guarantee 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, health officials and some consumer and environmental groups 
say there is no guarantee of greater safety in bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, titled "Bottled Water: Sparkling Hype at a Premium Price," 
the Environmental Policy Institute, based in Washington, attacked the 
"unfounded presumption" that bottled water "is invariably preferable to tap 
water . . . from a health perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Such critics point out that bottled and public water supplies typically are 
drawn from sources that are equally at risk from pollution. Often, bottled 
water is tap water that is filtered or treated again. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, California health authorities and bottled water industry officials 
made the surprising discovery that tiny traces of methylene chloride, a 
chemical solvent, were leaching into bottled waters from their plastic 
containers. The state has since imposed a strict limit on methylene chloride in 
bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also argue that federal regulations do more to assure the purity of 
public water supplies than bottled water. That is because the federal Food and 
Drug Administration -- which regulates bottled water -- has failed to set 
standards for some contaminants that the Environmental Protection Agency has 
set limits for in public supplies. 
</P>
<P>
But in California, new state regulations have nearly reversed the situation. 
Legislation passed in 1987 requires bottled water -- including imported water 
that is distributed in California -- to comply with stiffer standards for some 
contaminants than public supplies. The law set lower bottled water limits for 
lead, organic solvents and trihalomethanes -- byproducts of water disinfectants 
that are suspected of causing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP employee survey showed that workers are almost as nervous as ordinary 
customers about the safety of public water supplies. Asked why a majority of 
employees would prefer bottled or filtered water, Waters said the workers are 
"pretty much typical citizens of the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
In one way, however, the employees are different than other city residents. 
They are "less responsible" than regular customers "in the area of 
conservation," the employee survey found. Specifically, it said, customers are 
more likely than employees to cut their water use in response to DWP's higher 
summer rates. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP should try to educate its workers "on the need to set a better 
example," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
The employees also were more convinced than customers that DWP water diversions 
from streams feeding Mono Lake are having a negative environmental impact. This 
is despite the DWP's unwavering position -- enunciated in litigation and public 
statements -- that there is no proof of lasting harm to the lake, whose level 
has dropped because its feeder streams are tapped for one-seventh of the city's 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Among customers, 32% believe that there is a negative impact on Mono Lake, 13% 
believe there is not and 55% are not sure. 
</P>
<P>
But 46% of the employees believe that there is a negative impact on Mono Lake, 
compared to 30% who do not and 24% who are unsure. Said Waters: "I don't think 
that the bulk of our employees are really aware of all of the facts." 
</P>
<P>
The surveys did contain some good news for the DWP. Although most customers 
thought that DWP service was comparable to that of other utilities, 31% 
perceived a difference -- and by a 4-1 margin that group said the DWP does a 
better job than other utilities. 
</P>
<P>
The surveys were not intended for public release, but were provided in response 
to a request from The Times. Waters said the studies, which together cost about 
$120,000, were meant to serve as internal guidelines to improve the utility's 
service and image. 
</P>
<P>
For the customer survey, 1,001 water users throughout the city were interviewed 
last February and March by researchers from Reichman-Karten-Sword Inc. of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
For the employee survey, 1,688 of the DWP's 11,573 employees were interviewed 
by the Evaluation and Training Institute of Los Angeles, another research 
organization. Waters said there was a 95% certainty that the margin of error 
for the two surveys was no greater than 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, California accounted for 35.7% of U.S. bottled water sales, 
according to the International Bottled Water Assn. Bottled water has always 
sold more briskly in Southern California than elsewhere, due partly to hot 
weather, aggressive marketing and objections to the taste of some public water 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP surveys show that demand for bottled and filtered water is continuing 
to grow. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1986, The Times reported that its own survey had found that four 
of 10 Californians and half of Los Angeles County residents were using bottled 
or filtered water. 
</P>
<P>
The latest DWP survey also shows that more customers use bottled and filtered 
water now than in 1987, when the utility conducted its earlier poll. In the 
earlier survey, 47% of customers used bottled water -- compared to 53% now -- 
and 16% used filtration devices, compared to 19% now. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of bottled water sales on DWP revenue is nil, since drinking water 
represents only a fraction of 1% of water consumption. 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials said they will not try to discourage use of alternate supplies by 
those who can afford them and prefer the taste. 
</P>
<P>
But they bristled at the thought that people buy bottled water as a necessity 
rather than luxury. 
</P>
<P>
If people would "rather be buying shoes for the kids or something, then I think 
we have some concerns there," Waters said. "It's really not fair to the people 
. . . because a lot of them are spending money to buy water that they really 
don't need to."

AIDS DRUG TEST SHOWS 'SERIOUS PROMISE, RISK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The organizer of an underground test using the highly touted AIDS drug Compound 
Q on Tuesday released preliminary results showing that the treatment holds 
"serious promise and serious risk," and he acknowledged that a third patient in 
the controversial experiment had died. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Delaney, co-founder of Project Inform, said in an interview that blood 
tests on 34 trial subjects suggest that the drug boosted levels of white blood 
cells that are key sentinels of the immune system -- called T4 cells -- while 
reducing the level of activity of the human immunodeficiency virus. Data on 37 
other trial subjects has not yet been compiled. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the home run that some people had hoped for," Delaney said. But, 
citing what he called "the drug's positive biological activity," Delaney urged 
accelerated research on the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said they had not seen 
Delaney's data and therefore would not comment on his results. In July, the 
agency asked him to stop administering the drug and it is continuing to 
investigate Delaney's program. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney said he expected to meet with FDA officials next month to present his 
data. In an interview with The Times, FDA Commissioner Dr. Frank Young said the 
agency had "invited" Delaney to conduct an FDA-sanctioned trial through a 
community-based research organization. 
</P>
<P>
Academic researchers, who have denounced Project Inform's Compound Q tests 
since they were first made public in June, said the data was too sketchy to 
draw conclusions. And, like Delaney, they strongly cautioned desperate AIDS 
patients against self-experimentation with the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"There is really nothing one can say at this point, except to people who have 
this drug in their refrigerators or have access to it through underground 
sources: Please do not take it," said Dr. Mathilde Krim, founding chair of the 
American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an import alert established by the FDA in July, between 500 and 1,000 
doses of the drug are believed to have slipped into the United States from 
China. Compound Q is a purified form of trichosanthin isolated from the root 
tubers of a cucumber plant known as Trichosanthes kirilowii. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at UC San Francisco and San Francisco General Hospital have been 
conducting FDA-sanctioned trials to determine the toxicity and maximum 
tolerable dose of the official version of the drug, known as GLQ-223, since May 
15. Official of Genelabs Inc., makers of GLQ-223, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no deaths in the official trial, though sources said that one 
of 18 patients enrolled in the experiment lapsed into a coma last month but has 
since recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Project Inform's test, conducted by doctors in San Francisco, New York, Los 
Angeles and Miami, was performed without oversight from an independent 
committee to look after the interests of experimental subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the big missing ingredient in the (Project Inform) trial," said Krim, 
a former researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York. "There 
needed to be an impartial group of people who reviewed the data, interpreted 
the data, and reported them. One cannot take the word of a lay person." 
</P>
<P>
Stung by the criticism, Delaney said Tuesday he would assemble "a blue-ribbon 
panel" to examine the data and to investigate the latest death, which occurred 
last month in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The two earlier deaths were in San Francisco. The first patient died after 
asking doctors to terminate life-support measures when the drug failed to clear 
up Kaposi's sarcoma lesions in his lungs; the second lapsed into a coma and 
later died. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths have caused a deep schism among AIDS advocates, some of whom have 
joined academic researchers in sharply criticizing Delaney. "All studies, 
official or unofficial, need to live up to the highest standards of scientific 
inquiry and medical care," said Mark Harrington, a member of the Treatment and 
Data Committee of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington, like Delaney, has been a frequent critic of the pace and priorities 
of federal and academic research effort on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if this drug is active, we still do not know how to use it, how often, in 
what dose, and in what combinations with other drugs," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney presented data from only the San Francisco and New York arms of the 
trial because of what he termed "record-keeping problems" in Los Angeles and 
Miami. As in the past, he played down the latest patient death, noting that it 
took place six weeks after the drug was taken and suggesting that it could have 
resulted from the patient's underlying illness. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, the average patient showed a 12% increase in T4 cells to 102 
per cubic millimeter of blood after two months of three weekly applications of 
the drug. In New York, where the average patient was a bit healthier, the jump 
in T4 cells was a more robust 42%, to 169. Healthy people usually have T4 
counts of more than 800. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney also reported that nine of 15 patients in San Francisco showed 
"sustained reductions in P-24 antigen levels averaging 50%." The P-24 test is a 
measure of viral activity, although its usefulness in evaluating AIDS drugs is 
the subject of considerable debate. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, a study released by UC San Francisco doctors at a medical 
conference in Houston showed that 28% of AIDS patients in that city are taking 
unapproved medications, often without telling their doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Study author Dr. Ruth Greenblatt said such self-medication poses risks of 
potentially fatal drug interactions. 
</P>
<P>
Times medical writer Robert Steinbrook contributed to this story from Los 
Angeles.

U.S. CRITICIZED FOR IMPASSE ON CHEMICAL ARMS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the eve of what the United States had expected to be a breakthrough on a 
chemical weapons accord, the Bush Administration is coming under growing 
criticism from the Soviet Union, Western European allies and Third World 
countries for alleged foot-dragging on a new international treaty. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had expected acclaim for simultaneous arms initiatives at 
meetings this week in Wyoming between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and at an international chemical 
weapons conference here that, ironically, the United States had asked Australia 
to organize in an effort to spur momentum on an accord. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Administration is being sharply criticized, both publicly and 
privately, for failing to move on several issues that could break a three-year 
impasse on negotiations. And the spirit of cooperation between the superpowers 
expected in Wyoming has been replaced by a rivalry at the Australia conference, 
which opened Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not what we expected. We expected to be awarded, but instead we're 
getting burned unjustifiably," one American delegate said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has encountered its greatest criticism for refusing to agree 
to a deadline for concluding a new international chemical weapons treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, France, West Germany, Australia and several Third World 
nations have pressed the U.S. delegation to offer a target date for concluding 
an accord on one of the world's most controversial types of weapons, most 
recently used with deadly effect in the eight-year Persian Gulf War. Several 
delegations came out of private bilateral talks charging that the United States 
is stalling. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is also being accused of: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Slowing down agreements on mandatory short-notice inspections of any site 
suspected of hiding deadly poison and nerve gases. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Failing to agree to help Third World nations develop alternative chemicals 
used only for peaceful purposes in an industry vital to economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Refusing to provide mandatory financial or military aid to countries 
victimized by violators of a chemical warfare treaty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'As Soon as Possible' 
</P>
<P>
"We reject charges that we are foot-dragging. We would like to complete an 
agreement as soon as possible, like everyone else," Ambassador Max L. 
Friedersdorf, U.S. representative to the Geneva disarmament conference, told 
The Times in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have taken the lead on the negotiations," he added. "When they say 
we are foot-dragging, that means the U.S. does not agree with their positions." 
</P>
<P>
But the chief delegate from a leading Western nation charged: "The Americans 
have been struck by inertia for almost three years." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation expected two specific proposals put forward here to 
demonstrate the Bush Administration's commitment to a chemical weapons ban. 
Instead, the Soviet Union has stolen the limelight by going even further. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. chemical manufacturers announced a five-point self-regulation 
plan to prevent the spread of poison gases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moscow Export Controls 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union then revealed that Moscow has already introduced new export 
controls on 40 controversial chemicals. Sales will have to carry so-called end 
user certificates guaranteeing that they will not be resold or used for 
development of chemical weapons. The provisions are now the strictest controls 
in the world, Australian officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet delegation chief, Nikolai P. Smidovich, also called for 
international cooperation among chemical industries. 
</P>
<P>
In a second initiative, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Clarke 
proposed a new interim body to coordinate sensitive pre-verification issues. In 
a speech scheduled for delivery today, the Soviets are expected to again go 
further. 
</P>
<P>
A Bush Administration official conceded before the conference began: "We are 
not negotiating seriously. Strong presidential leadership is necessary to move 
fast on negotiations. We could wrap it up in a year if we really wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. refusal to set even a target date for concluding an accord has 
elicited the deepest concern here. "We were ready to try to make an agreement 
this year," Smidovich said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who saw the United States hold up the negotiations over the past 
three years hoped that, with a change in administrations, the U.S. would be 
ready to move more speedily," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even U.S. officials concede that progress since 1987 had lagged in part because 
of a lack of impetus from the Reagan Administration. Then, after taking office 
last January, the Bush Administration argued that it needed time to review U.S. 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. keeps saying that there are too many details to be worked out. We 
said, 'OK, how about 1992?' We were told the U.S. does not want to set 
artificial deadlines," Smidovich complained. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation has responded that it does not want to repeat the mistakes 
of the 1972 biological weapons convention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Sloppy Job' 
</P>
<P>
"We rushed to sign a piece of paper, but it sits today without a means of 
verification," Clarke told the conference. "A sloppy job of verification on a 
chemical weapons convention would damage the entire structure of arms control." 
</P>
<P>
But European allies and several Third World nations claim a tentative deadline 
is now needed to inject momentum into talks that have crawled along in Geneva 
under U.N. auspices for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to feel there is commitment from the U.S.," said one Asian delegate, 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "So far, we feel there is more talk 
than action. The U.S. is prepared to address its agenda but not our concerns, 
which have to be taken into account to win our agreement. It will not feel 
vulnerable without chemical weapons, but we will." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
68 States Involved 
</P>
<P>
The disagreements underscore the complexity of a multilateral treaty, the first 
such attempt since the 1963 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The current 
Geneva talks involve 40 nations, plus 28 observer states -- and the disparate 
concerns of each. 
</P>
<P>
Several Third World nations, which have increasingly turned to chemical weapons 
as a cheaper and more accessible alternative to nuclear arms, now argue that 
there is limited incentive to agree to an international ban -- particularly if 
regional rivals possess the deadly toxins. 
</P>
<P>
"If a party is attacked by someone who has developed chemical weapons 
clandestinely, then we believe all parties to a treaty should commit to come to 
their aid with either financial or military aid," Iranian delegate Hassan G. 
Mashhadi said in an interview. "So far, the U.S. has talked only about 
voluntary or humanitarian aid." 
</P>
<P>
Iran was repeatedly the victim of Iraqi chemical weapons between 1984 and 1988, 
according to U.N. reports. 
</P>
<P>
"We need more guarantees that we will not be left exposed," Mashhadi said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union and several other nations support collective responsibility 
for victims of chemical weapon violators. As an alternative, Moscow has backed 
proposals for an international fund to contribute money or support to countries 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared, through the Red Cross or other agencies, to provide 
humanitarian aid," Friedersdorf said. "But what some of these countries want is 
for the industrialized nations to set up a slush fund. A fund is a possibility, 
but we don't like the mandatory approach." 
</P>
<P>
Another concern is that various restrictions on up to 40 chemicals -- some of 
which are basic to production of everything from fountain-pen ink and plastics 
to fertilizers -- will impede Third World development. 
</P>
<P>
"The chemical industry accounts for $90 billion a year worldwide. It is the 
largest industry in the world, and the Third World wants its share," said one 
Latin American delegate, who requested that his name not be used. "With 
restrictions, we may have a ban on simple things we are finally capable of 
producing for ourselves. Then we will have to rely on buying materials that 
others have. This is colonization again. 
</P>
<P>
"Industrialized nations should be more generous in supporting us, rather than 
making us more dependent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation has countered that banning the inherent threat of chemical 
weapons should be incentive enough to agree to an accord. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see arms control as part of a welfare program. We're not into the 
game of bribing countries to sign up for a chemical weapons treaty by providing 
aid or technology," Friedersdorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials also contend that Congress would not ratify a treaty 
that added what amounts to a multimillion-dollar foreign aid project. Another 
problem is that the technology is in the hands of private U.S. industry, over 
which the government has no control. 
</P>
<P>
But at least one country, Pakistan, has indicated privately that it will not 
agree to an accord without transfer of alternative chemical technology. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pakistanis were quite blunt. They said that this was the price for signing 
up," a U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
The main dispute here between the U.S. and Soviet delegations centers on "any 
time, any place" inspections of suspected secret caches of lethal toxins, an 
idea first put forward at the disarmament conference by then-Vice President 
Bush in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, during the last major breakthrough in talks, Moscow accepted the 
concept. The Soviets are now charging that Washington is balking. 
</P>
<P>
"There are concerns because of proprietary rights and the secrets of private 
industry that might be violated because of intrusion," Friedersdorf said. 
"Proposals have been made by various delegations in Geneva which would provide 
that there be ways to protect civilian or military installations (that are) not 
pertinent but which may have to be part of access during an inspection. In no 
way has this slowed down talks." 
</P>
<P>
But the Administration official conceded: "We put forth the idea without fully 
thinking it through. Then the Soviets accepted it. Now we're trying to figure 
out what it would mean. For example, does that include Langley (the Virginia 
town where the CIA is headquartered)?" 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. spokesman attempted to counter the criticism, saying: "We regret that 
other countries have felt compelled to make unfounded charges about our 
performance at the disarmament conference, which we reject. For our part, we 
hope our negotiations presented in Canberra will advance the Geneva 
negotiations even further." 
</P>
<P>
But the leading Western official charged: "On each of the important issues, the 
U.S. delegation has repeatedly told us over the past three years, 'We have no 
instruction on that issue.' The U.S. still has a long way to go on addressing 
the issues that have been on the table for years."

MEXICO ASKS U.S. TO PROBE ACTIONS OF BORDER PATROL

The Mexican Embassy has filed a complaint with the U.S. State Department, 
asking for an investigation of two border incidents last month in which one 
Mexican youth was run over and killed by a Border Patrol vehicle and another 
was shot and wounded by a Border Patrol agent. 
</P>
<P>
Marcela Merina, spokeswoman for the Mexican Consulate in San Diego, on Tuesday 
categorized the action by the embassy in Washington as "a show of concern about 
these incidents along the border" and said the complaint, filed Friday, was not 
an official diplomatic protest. 
</P>
<P>
The first incident occurred Aug. 20 in the predawn hours when Luis Eduardo 
Hernandez Hernandez, 14, was run over by a Border Patrol vehicle less than a 
mile west of the San Ysidro port of entry. 
</P>
<P>
In the second incident on Aug. 27, Pedro Garcia Hernandez, 15, was shot once in 
the stomach by an agent who said the youth had grabbed a "softball-sized" rock 
and was going to throw it at another agent. Like the previous incident, the 
shooting occurred just west of the San Ysidro port of entry. 
</P>
<P>
"Regarding the first of the two incidents . . . this is not the first time that 
a Mexican citizen (has been) run over by a INS (Immigration and Naturalization 
Service) vehicle when trying to escape from the U.S. Border Patrol," the 
Mexican complaint said. "With regard to the second, the response of the INS 
agent, to maim or kill, was clearly out of proportion to the threat of having a 
stone thrown at him." 
</P>
<P>
Luis, who was from the Mexican state of Jalisco, died while trying to enter the 
United States with his 15-year-old brother. The two were en route to Los 
Angeles to reunite with their father. Border Patrol officials said the vehicle 
that killed the boy was traveling 15 m.p.h., but a lawyer representing the 
family said it was being driven recklessly at high speed. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro, a Tijuana orphan, lived in an abandoned car near the border and said he 
was just walking in the area when he was shot. He denied throwing any rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Merina said that Mexican officials have also asked the State Department to 
investigate another incident that occurred less than two hours before Pedro was 
shot. In that incident, three U.S. journalists witnessed a Border Patrol agent 
use his vehicle's public address system to taunt and shout obscenities at 
hundreds of immigrants waiting along the border near where the youth was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol spokesman Michael Gregg said the taunting incident is under 
investigation by the office of the inspector general. San Diego police are 
investigating the other two incidents, but the Border Patrol cleared the agents 
of any wrongdoing.

CRANSTON SAYS HE WON'T RETURN FUNDS RAISED BY OWNER OF S&amp;L

Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said Tuesday he will not return the money 
collected for his 1986 reelection campaign by Charles H. Keating, owner of 
Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, even though two other senators have 
done so. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston was responding to Sen. Dennis DeConcini's decision, announced Monday, 
to return $48,000 in contributions collected for him by Keating. DeConcini and 
Cranston were among five senators who received money raised by Keating and 
later met with officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board on behalf of 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini said that he decided to give the money back after federal regulators 
filed a $1.1-million fraud and racketeering civil lawsuit against Keating last 
Friday. He said that he did so because the suit "raises the serious possibility 
that money from Lincoln Savings may have been illegally funneled" into the 
campaigns of the senators. 
</P>
<P>
The Arizona Democrat wrote personal checks to repay the money Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Cranston's spokesman, Murray Flander, said that the suit does nothing to 
change the position of the California senator, who has said that he did nothing 
illegal by accepting money raised by Keating. Cranston received $39,000 in 
campaign donations raised by Keating, who also contributed about $800,000 to 
voter registration drives supported by the senator.

CATASTROPHIC CARE MAY BE CLOSE TO REPEAL DUE TO OPPOSITION BY ELDERLY OVER 
SURTAX

<P>
Responding to pressure from angry elderly voters, congressional leaders said 
Tuesday for the first time that the Medicare catastrophic care program may be 
on the verge of repeal. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of support for repeal," said House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.). "I believe the elderly want changes in the way the system 
works." House Majority Whip William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), said: "There's a lot 
of frustration out there . . . . (Repeal) could happen." 
</P>
<P>
Although many members of the House had indicated that repeal of the program is 
possible, the remarks by Gephardt and Gray were the first admissions by 
Democratic leaders that they may be unable to save it. The program -- the 
largest expansion in Medicare benefits in 23 years -- was overwhelmingly 
approved by Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revolt Over Surtax 
</P>
<P>
But the financing of the benefits, through premiums and taxes paid exclusively 
by Medicare beneficiaries, prompted a revolt among people over 65. They are 
particularly angry about a surtax, ranging from $22.50 to $800 a year, that 
would be paid by Medicare beneficiaries who earn enough to pay federal income 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
A repeal vote could come as early as next week on the House floor. The House 
will be considering budget legislation for the 1990 fiscal year, and an 
amendment to repeal catastrophic care might be offered. Even if there is no 
vote then, opponents of catastrophic care will keep pressing the issue until 
they can bring it to the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee, struggling to save catastrophic care 
by defusing the anger of the elderly, Tuesday began considering a plan to cut 
the surtax rate -- to 12% from the current 15% -- and to reduce the maximum 
from $800 to $585. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), the committee chairman, said catastrophic care has 
"basic elements certainly worthy of trying to preserve." Catastrophic care 
includes unlimited days of hospital care after the patient pays for the first 
day, a cap on out-of-pocket spending for doctor bills and coverage of 
prescription drugs for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The plan being considered by the Finance Committee would curtail benefits to 
compensate for the loss of revenues that would result if the surtax is cut. The 
proposed ceiling on an individual's payments to doctors would climb to $1,780 
from $1,370, and the cap would be delayed a year until 1991. The skilled 
nursing care benefit, which has been liberalized this year, would be sharply 
restricted again by imposing a waiting period of three days in the hospital 
before a patient can enter a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday the House Ways and Means Committee passed a bill that would 
change the catastrophic care program by cutting in half the surtax but boosting 
the monthly premiums that recipients pay by $4. The bill also would pare back 
the prescription drug benefit and would permit the elderly to drop out of the 
program if they also dropped the popular doctor fee insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen acknowledged that he is struggling uphill in efforts save the 
catastrophic care legislation. "I know many feel we should repeal it," he said. 
"There will be an effort on the Senate floor. On the House side, there's a 
probability it's going to be repealed." 
</P>
<P>
The committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), predicted that 
the House "apparently will repeal it" by a large margin. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen adjourned the Finance Committee meeting until today because he was 
irritated that the Bush Administration has not offered help in rewriting the 
legislation. The Administration says it needs the surplus revenues forecast for 
the early years of the bill and has refused to recommend changes. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen was nettled because Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health and human 
services, did not attend Tuesday's committee meeting. Sullivan "should have 
been here," Bentsen said. "There is no more important measure before his 
department." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for Sullivan was Gerald Olson, assistant secretary for legislation, 
who said the Administration would accept virtually any committee plan that does 
not add to the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to give us any leadership," Packwood said to Olson. Bentsen 
called for Sullivan to attend today's meeting.

HER FEVER GONE, HEART IS ERRATIC; 
</P>
<P>
MOTHER TERESA'S CONDITION 'SERIOUS BUT NOT CRITICAL' 
</P>

<P>
Doctors treating Mother Teresa described her condition Tuesday as "serious but 
not critical," adding that the 79-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is likely 
to remain in the hospital for "a minimum of four to six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The fever that posed an imminent threat to Mother Teresa's life last week has 
finally gone, the doctors said, but her heart remains erratic and the 
internationally acclaimed Roman Catholic nun continues to have chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an old heart," declared Dr. Rajin Watts, Mother Teresa's personal 
physician for the past 25 years. "And she has battered it around quite a bit, 
that's for sure. The problem still remains of the pain in the chest. And we are 
rather concerned about that, anxious about it, really." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's account of Mother Teresa's health came during a news conference that 
provided the first detailed information about her precise condition since the 
ailing Mother Superior was admitted to Calcutta's private Woodland's Nursing 
Home on Sept. 5, suffering from a severe viral infection and subsequent heart 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prognosis Is Upbeat 
</P>
<P>
In general, the doctors' prognosis was upbeat. Dr. George Lombardi, a New York 
City specialist in infectious diseases who rushed to Calcutta 10 days ago, is 
returning home today, and the doctors said that the infection that sent Mother 
Teresa's temperature soaring to 104 degrees last week is gone. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors conceded that the infection had been caused by a pacemaker device 
installed as a safety measure for the nun's weak heart, but they added that 
such infections are not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of Mother Teresa's care has been the source of widespread concern 
here in Calcutta, where the nun, born in Yugoslavia of Albanian parents, 
started her Missionaries of Charity order four decades ago and where she is now 
revered as a living saint. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors said that Mother Teresa insisted she not be moved from Calcutta, 
regardless of her condition, and all agreed that she is not only receiving the 
best of care but that her condition is improving. 
</P>
<P>
"Angina pain is serious, but not critical," Watts told reporters. "She is 
comfortable. She's eating. She's conscious. She's talking. She's smiling." 
</P>
<P>
But Watts stressed that his patient is nowhere near recovered and that any 
public appearance or interview is out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
"She is serious, not critical," he said. "Please do not exaggerate that 
statement, but don't underplay it also." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Mother Teresa ever will be able to resume her breakneck schedule, 
which traditionally has included regular visits to all 66 countries where her 
order now maintains orphanages, clinics, hospices, refugee centers and homes 
for the destitute, Watts was not encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, for the time being, it's out of the question," he said. "But I 
wouldn't play that up too much, because she could get pretty depressed about 
it."

U.N. TO TACKLE DRUGS, ENVIRONMENT ISSUES

<P>
With the end of the Cold War between the superpowers, Secretary General Javier 
Perez de Cuellar said Tuesday the United Nations must now turn to the world's 
"tremendous social problems" of the environment, drug trafficking, acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome and terrorism -- and find the money to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
Perez de Cuellar spoke at a news conference at the opening of the 44th session 
of the General Assembly. President Bush and other world leaders will address 
the Assembly in a general debate beginning next week. Bush is expected to 
propose a world campaign to fight drugs, possibly including a special Assembly 
session devoted exclusively to combatting narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if such a session would be helpful, Perez de Cuellar replied, "I am 
prepared to accept any initiative and to help in any way in the solution of 
this very, very tragic question." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Billionaire's Business' 
</P>
<P>
But although he conceded that a special session would add to the already 
strained budget of the world body, he also warned: 
</P>
<P>
"The drug business is a billionaire's business. You need billions if you want 
to fight billions. . . . What is needed is a tremendous financial effort, not 
only a military effort or a technical effort." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a restructuring of international relations that has brought half a 
dozen conflicts to the United Nations for settlement, he deplored the lack of 
money to pay for the burgeoning U.N. peacekeeping forces. Payment for existing 
forces is $600 million in arrears, he said, without naming the chief 
delinquent, the United States, which owes more than $400 million of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Perez de Cuellar announced that he is now seeking an additional 500 troops for 
the force of 1,000 peacekeepers already on duty in Namibia, the African 
territory ruled by South Africa that is in transition to independence. 
</P>
<P>
He also said if current peace negotiations in the former Spanish Sahara 
succeed, he will have to set up an "important operation" there. Other 
potentially costly peacekeeping forces may be needed for Central America, 
Afghanistan, Cambodia, Iran and Iraq, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire international community is applauding," he said ruefully, "but I 
would like to see them do what is their duty -- pay their contributions to our 
peacekeeping operations." 
</P>
<P>
Although only Jamaica and Trinidad have submitted specific proposals in the 
narcotics fight -- the first for a drug-fighting force and the second for a 
world drug tribunal -- Britain is expected to support the U.S. campaign for 
global action by pushing a Security Council initiative to combat international 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
In the General Assembly, meanwhile, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
will lead a call for a special session on the environment to take place in 
1991, the 20th anniversary of the Stockholm conference on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Ambassador Joseph N. Garba, who as an army officer served in a United 
Nations peacekeeping force in India and Pakistan, was unanimously elected 
president of the 44th session. The 47-year-old Nigerian succeeds former Foreign 
Minister Dante Caputo of Argentina.

REFORM COMMUNIST IS HUNGARY'S FRONT-RUNNER

<P>
The Communist Party of Hungary and leading opposition groups have reached 
agreement on a plan for the coming elections that is likely to ensure that the 
office of president will go to Imre Pozsgay, the Communists' leading reform 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was adopted in the final round-table meeting between the opposition 
groups and the Communist Party -- officially the Socialist Workers Party -- and 
calls for a presidential election Nov. 26, with parliamentary elections to 
follow within three months. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the most powerful opposition group, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, 
denied Tuesday that they had struck a deal with the Socialist Workers, whose 
negotiating team was led by Pozsgay and his reform forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bargain Is Suggested 
</P>
<P>
Other opposition figures suggested that the Democratic Forum leaders had made a 
bargain with Pozsgay to support his plan for an early presidential election in 
exchange for the post of prime minister in the new government. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, designed to provide a transition from a one-party state to a 
multi-party democracy, was signed by the representatives of six of the eight 
opposition groups and must be approved by Parliament before becoming official. 
But with the Socialist Workers Party in control of the present Parliament, no 
major problems are expected. 
</P>
<P>
Pozsgay, who shares a four-man leadership role in the Socialist Workers Party, 
has been driving steadily and -- even his opponents say -- shrewdly to win the 
presidency at a time when the party is split between reformers and 
conservatives and deeply threatened by the forthcoming elections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trounced by Opposition 
</P>
<P>
In recent by-elections, four Communist candidates have been severely trounced 
by opposition party candidates, suggesting that the Communists are in deeper 
trouble in Hungary than in Poland, where they were solidly defeated by 
candidates backed by Solidarity, the independent trade union movement. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Pozsgay, one of the best-known politicians in the country and one 
who has moved out in front of his rivals in advocating reforms, believe he can 
capitalize on his head start with an early presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
The early election is also expected to help Pozsgay evade a divisive showdown 
at a Socialist Workers Party congress set for Oct. 6, at which he can present 
himself as a "national candidate," above party concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Free Democrats, one of the opposition groups that declined to 
sign the agreement, charged that the Democratic Forum had sold out to Pozsgay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Isn't Necessary' 
</P>
<P>
"It is madness to make a deal this early," Miklos Herasti, a Free Democratic 
activist, said. "It isn't necessary." 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Democratic Forum, with 19,000 dues-paying members and the best 
national organization among the opposition groups, has won three of four recent 
by-elections and clearly feels that it can move out ahead of its rivals in the 
coming election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Jozsef Antall, the Democratic Forum leader, denied that his party had made a 
deal with the Communists, despite suggestions to the contrary that have 
appeared even in the government newspaper Magyar Hirlap. 
</P>
<P>
"What we agreed on was a basis for further discussions," Antall said. "I think 
we were responsible to sign the agreement, and those who think we were 
collaborating with the Communists are wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Antall and representatives of the other parties to the agreement spent much of 
the time at a news conference Tuesday emphasizing that they had not entered 
into a political bargain with Pozsgay. Their repeated insistence reflected what 
is likely to be a widespread public perception of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An Orderly Transition' 
</P>
<P>
The opposition groups also emphasized the need for "an orderly transition," and 
they suggested that their arrangement with the Communists will ensure this. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an enormous economic crisis in the country," Imre Boros of the 
Independent Smallholders Party said, "and there is no way to go on with 
economic changes without political changes, and political changes demand 
stability." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also set guidelines for proposed reforms of the criminal code and 
court procedure to "conform to accepted norms of human and political rights." 
</P>
<P>
It calls for an end to political patronage and influence in the military, and 
it would bring the so-called "workers' militia," which has served as a sort of 
Communist Party military reserve, under the military's control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision to Come 
</P>
<P>
It was not certain whether any of the opposition groups were planning to put up 
candidates in opposition to Pozsgay. Antall said the Democratic Forum will 
decide whether to do so after consultation with its members. 
</P>
<P>
So far, none of the opposition groups have put forth any potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement appears to be an important victory for Pozsgay, but the Socialist 
Workers Party is not expected to fare well in the parliamentary elections that 
will follow. Although the early election is expected to help the Communists, 
most observers believe they will be lucky to win 20% of the seats in the new 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here say that the best the Communists can hope for is a 
coalition with one of the opposition groups, and some believe that Pozsgay may 
have prepared the ground for such a coalition in his dealings with the 
Democratic Forum.

HOUSE PANEL REPORTEDLY TO SEEK 35% RAISE, END TO HONORARIUMS

A bipartisan House task force has decided to recommend a pay increase of up to 
35% over the next two years, coupled with a phase-out of speech honorariums, 
and it will present the tentative plan to Democratic and Republican leaders 
this week, informed sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The pay plan, which would contain a new provision for continuing cost-of-living 
increases in the years ahead, would be coupled with a tightening of some House 
rules regarding financial disclosure, gifts and travel as well as a reduction 
in the amount of outside earned income that members may keep. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the recommendations call for adjustments rather than wholesale changes 
of House policies that have drawn fire from many self-styled reformers. But the 
task force is expected to recommend basic and possibly far-reaching changes in 
the House Ethics Committee, splitting the committee into two separate panels, 
one that would function as a grand jury to bring charges and the other to judge 
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Any final plan would be up to House leaders of both parties, who are described 
as pessimistic that any plan can be sold to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The task force was formed earlier this year after a presidential panel 
recommended that House and Senate members be given a 51% increase in their 
$89,500 annual pay. Groups around the country, led by radio talk shows, many 
newspapers and consumer advocate Ralph Nader, protested and forced defeat of 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the task force has decided to recommend a 10% increase in 1990 to 
make up for several years in which Congress has not allowed itself to take a 
cost-of-living increase. Then, in 1991, after the next congressional elections, 
Congress would be given a 25% increase, followed by regular cost-of-living 
raises. 
</P>
<P>
Speech honorariums would be phased out over two years. But under a new formula, 
members would be able to keep up to 15% of outside income other than 
honorariums.

GLOBAL WARMING STORM LINK PROBED; 
</P>
<P>
PREDICTED RISE IN OCEAN TEMPERATURES MAY INCREASE WINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hurricane Hugo is a harbinger of the type of high-intensity storms that can be 
expected more often in the future due to the greenhouse effect and the 
resulting global warming, researchers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Warming ocean and air temperatures will feed extra energy into the hurricanes, 
increasing their wind speeds by 20% to 25% and their maximum intensity by as 
much as 60%, according to computer models. 
</P>
<P>
"We can say with some confidence that the frequency of Category 4 and Category 
5 hurricanes (the most severe) will increase, but we can't say by how much," 
said meteorologist Richard Anthes, head of the university consortium that 
operates the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Sets Record 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the most intense hurricane ever observed in the Atlantic Ocean, 
Hurricane Gilbert with wind speeds of more than 200 m.p.h., occurred last 
September. But neither Gilbert nor Hugo can be definitely linked to global 
warming, researchers noted. "It's impossible to link one event to climatic 
change," Anthes said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are generally cautious in their predictions about the effects of 
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to take something as complex as a hurricane and attribute 
changes to a single cause like warmer temperatures, simply because the 
atmosphere is such a complex mixture and there are so many physical processes 
going on," said Ohio State University atmospheric scientist Jay Hobgood, one of 
the researchers whose models are the basis for projections of hurricane 
strengths. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an awful lot of uncertainty and an awful lot that is not understood," 
added meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
another modeler. "But if ocean temperature goes up, the intensity of extreme 
hurricanes will go up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seat-of-the-Pants Feeling' 
</P>
<P>
And, said meteorologist Rainer Bleck of the University of Miami, there is a 
growing consensus among researchers that this is what will happen. But "that 
conclusion is not based on scientific results yet," he added. "It is more of a 
seat-of-the-pants feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The link to global warming occurs because heat is the engine that drives 
hurricanes. Strong sunlight heats both air and water near the Equator, causing 
a greater evaporation of moisture from the ocean. The warm, moist air expands 
and rises, creating a ring of low pressure and storms around the Equator known 
as the Intertropical Convergence Zone. 
</P>
<P>
As the moist air rises, it cools, causing its moisture to condense into clouds. 
But that condensation releases a tremendous amount of heat stored in the 
gaseous water, accelerating the heating and rising of the air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starts With 'Kicker' 
</P>
<P>
Although scientists do not yet know under precisely what conditions hurricanes 
form, this condensation and heat release is the "kicker" that starts vast 
amounts of air climbing upward, drawing in ever-larger quantities of moist air 
from the ocean surface, Bleck said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Earth's rotation causes the fast-moving air masses to spin in a 
counterclockwise motion in the Northern Hemisphere or clockwise in the 
Southern. 
</P>
<P>
Hurricanes typically take five to six days to form, eventually spreading over 
an area of thousands of square miles and developing wind speeds that range from 
75 m.p.h. (the official minimum for a hurricane) to more than 200 m.p.h. The 
storms continue as long as they can draw warm moist air from the ocean. 
Hurricanes peter out when they pass over cold water or land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gases Trap Heat 
</P>
<P>
Climatologists predict that global warming -- caused by the accumulation of 
carbon dioxide and certain other gases in the atmosphere, which trap the 
Earth's heat like the panes of a greenhouse -- will cause both ocean and air 
temperatures to increase, perhaps eventually by as much as 10 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
A warmer ocean causes more water to evaporate, and warmer air can hold more 
water vapor. Both factors would increase the strength of hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what you see in reality," Hobgood said. "If you have warmer air, warmer 
water, you do get a more intense storm." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Need More Research' 
</P>
<P>
The problem, he added, is that warming will not occur to the same extent 
everywhere, and other conditions caused by global warming, such as stronger 
winds at high altitudes, might mitigate some of the effects of heating. "We 
need to do a lot more research," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers did have one piece of good news. Hurricane Hugo will probably 
sap the strength of tropical depression Iris, which is following close behind 
it. It will probably also push Iris northward into the Atlantic, keeping it 
from striking the United States or islands in the Caribbean.

YORBA LINDA OKS NIXON BIRTHDAY HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The birthday of former President Richard M. Nixon will become a holiday for the 
employees of Yorba Linda, the Orange County city that claims Nixon as its 
native son. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to judge history, we're here to recognize it," said Mayor Henry 
W. (Hank) Wedaa. 
</P>
<P>
Wedaa said that despite Nixon's resignation from the presidency in 1974 under 
the cloud of the Watergate scandal, the proposal to commemorate his birthday 
has met with warm response. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the resolution was proposed, I have been amazed at the positive response 
that's come forth," he said. "Many of us have felt it was time for a holiday 
for President Nixon, and the time has come." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night to declare a city holiday each Jan. 
9, the day Nixon was born in a Yorba Linda farmhouse in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen years have elapsed since President Nixon's resignation and history has 
shown the importance of his presidency, particularly with respect to his 
brilliance in foreign policy," the resolution said. 
</P>
<P>
Wedaa, who proposed the measure two weeks ago, said he hoped that the Richard 
M. Nixon Presidential Library now under construction in Yorba Linda will 
schedule special events for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The response from Nixon to having a city holiday in his honor is "that he's 
pleased," Wedaa said. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's birthday will be an added holiday for Yorba Linda's 100 to 110 city 
employees, costing the city an additional $10,000 a year, according to 
Assistant City Manager Bruce E. Channing. It will be celebrated beginning in 
1990.

The commission said the recalled model is number S7417. The brown, 14-inch 
stuffed bear is clad in a maroon print dress trimmed with pink and blue ribbons 
at the hem and three heart-shaped buttons sewn on the front. The bear's outfit 
also includes white lace bloomers and a straw hat with a pink bow.

<P>
The panel said the buttons "may pose a potential choking hazard for children 
under age 3" who might loosen and pull the buttons off the dress and swallow

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO HIKE BASE PAY TO $4.25 IN BILL DEFYING VETO THREAT 
</P>

<P>
Defying threats of a second presidential veto, the Democratic-controlled House 
Education and Labor Committee Tuesday agreed to raise the federal minimum wage 
to $4.25 an hour on Jan. 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The committee voted also to allow employers to pay a lower starting wage of 
$3.61 an hour for 60 days to newly hired employees with no previous experience 
in the labor force. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, a plan by President Bush would not raise the current minimum wage 
of $3.35 an hour until 1992, although he also would raise it to $4.25. 
Additionally, his plan would allow employers in 1992 to pay newly hired workers 
$3.40 a hour for six months, whether or not they had previous job experience. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic-dominated House is expected to pass the bill next month, and a 
similar measure has been prepared for Senate approval before the start of the 
new fiscal year on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Bush previously delivered an ultimatum to Congress, vowing to veto any minimum 
wage bill if the top rate exceeded $4.25 an hour and did not include his 
conditions for a starting wage. 
</P>
<P>
The President made good on his promise on June 13, rejecting a bill that raised 
the floor to $4.55 an hour and contained the 60-day starting wage provision. 
</P>
<P>
Because the average hourly pay for private non-farm workers was $9.70 an hour 
last July, the fight over the minimum wage may involve greater political 
symbolism than economic impact. California, for example, already has a $4.25 
minimum pay rate, and about a dozen other states have wage floors higher than 
the federal level. 
</P>
<P>
But partisan lines were clearly drawn on the issue, with intensive lobbying for 
the increase by organized labor and heavy opposition from the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce and other business groups. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the committee, noted that 
the Bush Administration has agreed to negotiate with Congress on clean air 
standards, drug policy and the federal budget, but not on an increase in the 
minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials have said that Bush's veto of a minimum wage of $4.55 
apparently inflicted little political damage. Rep. Austin J. Murphy (D-Pa.), a 
leading advocate of a minimum wage increase, said that he was informed Tuesday 
by Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole: "The President has no 
concessions."

One sportfishing boat sank and another was badly damaged as the result of a 
collision in the early morning darkness off San Diego Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There was a total of 32 people aboard the two vessels and all were rescued by 
other sportfishing boats except for the crewmen on the damaged vessel who 
remained aboard while it was towed to port. Three people were slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
The scene of the 3 a.m. crash was near the Coronado Islands, a popular fishing 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The two vessels in the collision were the 50-foot Temptress, with five 
passengers and three crew members, and the 65-foot Aztec, with 19 passengers 
and five crew members. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego-based Temptress sank within an hour of the collision, according 
to witnesses. The Aztec, from Long Beach, was towed to San Diego by a salvage 
vessel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Warning 
</P>
<P>
One fisherman aboard the Temptress said the accident occurred without warning. 
</P>
<P>
"I was knocked out of bed and heard the crunching of the two bows," said Ralph 
Nelson, 45, a Newport Beach businessman. "A voice behind me said, 'Let's get 
out of here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the entire right portion of the Temptress' bow was missing. Within 
half an hour, the crew and passengers had abandoned ship, and by 4 a.m. the 
only part of the boat still above water was the mast, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the collision had not been determined, according to Lt. Larry 
Solberg of the Coast Guard marine safety office in San Diego and Coast Guard 
officials late Tuesday were still trying to piece together all the facts of the 
accident. They had yet to to interview Curt Wegener, the skipper of the Aztec, 
who remained on the vessel while it was towed to port. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weather Not Factor 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the weather was not a factor in the collision. He said there was a 
three-quarter moon and no fog. The Temptress was heading south, and the Aztec, 
returning to port after a two-day fishing trip, was northbound. 
</P>
<P>
Those aboard the Aztec were rescued by the sportfishing boat Grande 85. A 
passenger on the Grande 85 said that floodlights and the Aztec's recent fish 
catch attracted sharks during the rescue. He said many of those on the Aztec 
were partly dressed and without shoes. 
</P>
<P>
The New Lo-An, which also responded to the distress calls, rescued the eight 
people aboard the Temptress, skippered by Craig Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard was unable to estimate the cost of the collision but other 
charter-boat owners said it would cost about $75,00 to replace the Aztec, the 
larger of the two boats.

AT LONG LAST, MAYOR MEETS GOVERNOR

<TEXT>
<P>
After months of trying, the mayor of California's second-largest city finally 
got in to see the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, accompanied by San Diego Councilwoman Gloria McColl and 
Police Chief Bob Burgreen, met with Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday for about 
50 minutes to ask for state money to help battle drug-related crime and build 
more jails. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian promised to look into it, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor was very thoughtful," O'Connor said after the meeting at the 
Capitol. "We had ample opportunity to express the problems we're facing in San 
Diego. I was very impressed with his ability to listen, (the) comprehensive 
nature of everything we were allowed to say in the meeting, and we left with 
hope." 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor sidestepped questions on whether she apologized to the governor 
for reportedly angering him by the way she called for the meeting nearly four 
months ago in a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased about the outcome of the meeting. Thank you," she said in 
response to questions about an apology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'State of Emergency' Declared 
</P>
<P>
In May, O'Connor convened a press conference to declare a "state of emergency" 
in San Diego because of gang- and drug-related violence on city streets. She 
publicly called for a meeting with Deukmejian to ask that San Diego receive $34 
million from the state's $2.5-billion surplus to help build courtrooms and 
jails, as well as finance community programs. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor put out the call before her staff had officially notified Deukmejian's 
office, a move that Republican insiders have told The Times angered the 
governor, who prefers to deal with such requests privately. 
</P>
<P>
They said his pique, along with Republican complaints that O'Connor herself 
often shuns meetings with prominent businessmen, prompted Deukmejian to string 
O'Connor along on a date for the meeting. The mayor was forced to put her 
request in writing and offered to meet him anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deukmejian has attended many other public events, including 
receptions, speeches and his college reunion in New York. On Aug. 30, for 
instance, he and his wife, Gloria, were hosts to the Capitol press corps for a 
sit-down Mexican dinner in their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Deukmejian agreed to see O'Connor on Tuesday, and the mayor flew up to 
Sacramento to plead her case for the money. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said he emphasized to Deukmejian how San Diego is suffering from 
severe crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him about our crime problems, how we're adjacent to the border, how the 
flow of drugs is coming into San Diego, how we have the most overcrowded jail 
system in the country and we are attempting to battle both of those problems 
with limited resources," the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said Deukmejian listened "very intently," but also specifically 
pointed out that other cities -- Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco -- are 
facing the same problems. 
</P>
<P>
But the governor "acknowledged that we are somewhat unique" and said he would 
direct his staff to hold further meetings with San Diego officials, O'Connor 
and Burgreen said.

MEXICO ASKS AN INVESTIGATION OF DEATH, SHOOTING AT BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mexican Embassy has filed a complaint with the State Department, asking for 
an investigation of two border incidents last month, in which a Mexican 
teen-ager was run over and killed by a Border Patrol vehicle and another 
Mexican youth was shot and wounded by a Border Patrol agent. 
</P>
<P>
Marcela Merina, spokeswoman for the Mexican Consulate in San Diego, on Tuesday 
categorized the action as "a show of concern about these incidents along the 
border" and said the complaint was not an official diplomatic protest. The 
complaint was filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The first incident occurred at 2:30 a.m. on Aug. 20, when Luis Eduardo 
Hernandez Hernandez, 14, was run over by a Border Patrol vehicle, less than a 
mile west of the San Ysidro Port of Entry. 
</P>
<P>
In the second incident, on Aug. 27, Pedro Garcia Hernandez, 15, was shot once 
in the stomach by an agent who said the youth had grabbed a "softball-sized" 
rock and was going to throw it at another agent. Like the previous incident, 
the shooting occurred just west of the San Ysidro Port of Entry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Out of Proportion' 
</P>
<P>
"Regarding the first of the two incidents . . . this is not the first time that 
a Mexican citizen (has been) run over by an INS (Immigration and Naturalization 
Service) vehicle, when trying to escape from the U.S. Border Patrol," said the 
Mexican complaint. "With regard to the second, the response of the INS agent, 
to maim or kill, was clearly out of proportion to the threat of having a stone 
thrown at him." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who was from the Mexican state of Jalisco, died while trying to 
enter the United States with his 15-year-old brother. The two were en route to 
Los Angeles, to reunite with their father. Border Patrol officials said the 
vehicle that killed the boy was traveling at 15 m.p.h., but a lawyer 
representing the family said it was being driven recklessly and at high speed. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, a Tijuana orphan, lived in an abandoned car near the border and said he 
was just walking in the area when he was shot. He denied throwing any rocks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taunting Investigated 
</P>
<P>
Merina said Mexican officials have also asked the State Department to 
investigate another occurrence less than two hours before Garcia was shot. In 
that incident, three U.S. journalists saw a Border Patrol agent use his 
vehicle's public address system to taunt and shout obscenities at hundreds of 
immigrants who were waiting along the border, near where the youth was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol spokesman Michael Gregg said the taunting incident is under 
investigation by the Office of the Inspector General. San Diego police are 
investigating the other two incidents, but the Border Patrol has cleared the 
agents of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg declined to comment on the embassy's complaint, saying it was 
"inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said he could not 
confirm that the complaint was filed but called it a routine matter. "I have no 
reason to doubt that it was filed, but the sending of this type of note is an 
established thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican note asked that the Border Patrol agents "be prosecuted and 
sentenced accordingly" if they are "found guilty of negligence and abuse of 
(authority)."

CABLE NEWS NETWORK'S SHOW FOR SCHOOLS GETS A TRIAL IN TIERRASANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Birney Groom's seventh-grade social studies class at Farb Middle School on 
Tuesday became one of the first in California to use television news as a 
regular tool to improve understanding of current events. 
</P>
<P>
The Tierrasanta class is using the Atlanta-based Cable News Network show "CNN 
Newsroom," a 15-minute weekday newscast produced for secondary school students. 
It is provided free to any school equipped for cable transmission. 
</P>
<P>
Because the show has no commercials, it has been approved for classroom use by 
state schools Supt. Bill Honig. A classroom news show, "Channel One," was 
banned by Honig because it contains three minutes of commercials. Channel One 
is produced by Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Against Technology' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not against technology," Honig said in an interview Tuesday. "This one 
(CNN) is not a conduit to make sales at schools." 
</P>
<P>
Honig aide Bill Rukeyser said CNN administrators met with Honig and educational 
consultants from the California State University system to integrate the news 
program with state educational guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"We received assurances that it won't be 'dumbed down' news, but will be a 
quality presentation," Rukeyser said. "We'll follow this closely, but what we 
like is that CNN doesn't require the show to be aired every day . . . because 
it is non-commercial, (CNN) doesn't need a guaranteed number of viewers every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, 400 out of 490 schools are equipped to receive cable 
transmissions through the county Office of Education's Instructional Television 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The CNN news program, a fast-paced summary of major news stories followed by 
features ranging from business to science, is broadcast at 1:45 p.m. Pacific 
Daylight Time each weekday from Atlanta and taped for use later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teacher Curriculum Guide Provided 
</P>
<P>
CNN also provides electronically a daily curriculum guide for teachers, to help 
guide discussions following the program. 
</P>
<P>
Groom's class will watch the program as a pilot project this week. Then Groom 
will talk with Farb's other teachers about the benefits and drawbacks to 
expanding it schoolwide. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Groom divided his students into six groups to talk about which 
stories on the broadcast -- hurricane Hugo, Colombian drug wars, Arabic and 
Chinese instruction in high school, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- seemed 
to be most important. Groom pushed the students not to view the news as 
entertainment, to try to relate the hurricane's damage, for example, to their 
own concepts of human and environmental costs. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that only one of Groom's 32 students reads a newspaper each morning -- 
compared to almost all who said they watch television at some point during the 
day -- reinforced the view of educators, both locally and statewide, that the 
program, if used properly, will fill a major gap in student awareness of 
current events. 
</P>
<P>
"It draws together (the link) between schooling and democracy," county schools 
Supt. Tom Boysen said.

SEARCH PROVIDES HOPE FOR LEUKEMIA VICTIM; 
</P>
<P>
BONE MARROW DONOR IS FOUND FOR LEUCADIA BOY, 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joshua Kaplan, the 13-year-old Leucadia boy whose fight with leukemia sparked a 
nationwide search for life-saving bone marrow, has found a donor who may save 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
A qualified bone marrow donor was identified last month after a series of 
tests, and a marrow transplant that doctors believe will lead to the production 
of new, healthy blood for the youngster is scheduled for Sept. 28 in Seattle, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's family is "very relieved, very hopeful, but we're all still holding 
our breath," said Leah Cole, a family friend and director of Diegueno Country 
School in Rancho Santa Fe, where the boy's mother, Sherri, is a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua's leukemia had been in remission for nearly four years through 
cancer-fighting treatment, but it resurfaced last April and doctors said his 
best hope for survival would be a successful bone marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Search for a Donor 
</P>
<P>
But chances of finding the right donor were slim -- 1 in 15,000, given the 
exact matches of blood antigens necessary. A computer search was conducted of 
the 34,000 persons registered with the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry, and 
no one matched. In San Diego County, more than 5,000 persons had their own 
blood tested in response to a countywide plea for donors, according to the San 
Diego Blood Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, last month, a qualified donor was found. Officials will not disclose 
any information about the person, but Cole said she understood from the family 
that the donor is in his 20s, lives on the West Coast and has postponed an 
overseas vacation so that he can help Joshua. 
</P>
<P>
With that news, Joshua -- accompanied by his parents, Dr. Roy Kaplan and his 
wife, Sherri, and his younger sister, Jenny -- flew recently to Seattle's Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, which with 60 beds is the largest bone 
marrow transplant unit in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua's parents have declined comment, but said in a prepared statement at the 
cancer center, "The family appreciates the efforts and support of . . . the 
community. We know we wouldn't be here without that, and its help in finding a 
donor for Josh." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat of Infection, Bleeding 
</P>
<P>
Susan Edmonds, a spokesman for the cancer research center, said the marrow 
transplant itself is a simple procedure, but that patients face a critical 
period afterward, when they are especially susceptible to uncontrollable 
bleeding because of the temporary loss of platelets and to life-threatening 
infection because the body's immune system is virtually depleted. 
</P>
<P>
Patients typically arrive at the center two to three weeks before a transplant 
for extensive medical examinations, she said. A week before the transplant, the 
patient is admitted and undergoes an intensive regimen of high-dose 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, aimed at destroying the cancer in the 
marrow -- the thick, almost granular substance within the bone structure that 
manufactures the blood's red and white cells and the platelets that give the 
blood its clotting capability to prevent bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
The same process that rids the cancer, however, also destroys the blood 
platelets and the patient's immunity to infection. 
</P>
<P>
The marrow will be withdrawn from the donor's hip and flown to Seattle, where 
it will be transplanted that same day in a process that could last up to 10 
hours. The marrow will be introduced through a catheter that leads directly to 
the heart's atrium, from where it is carried into the bones and settles. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the patient is placed in a sterile environment for up to 40 days to 
protect him from infection that would otherwise be ripe to occur before new, 
healthy blood is produced to establish a renewed immune system. 
</P>
<P>
The patient usually is discharged from the hospital 40 days after the 
procedure, but then remains in a nearby apartment for another two months for 
out-patient observation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Only Alternative 
</P>
<P>
Despite the risks, Edmonds said, patients usually have no alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"This is their last chance for long-term survival," she said of leukemia 
patients receiving bone marrow transplants. "If they don't go through with it, 
they face almost certain death."

S.D. FIRM, SALESMAN INDICTED FOR ALLEGEDLY BRIBING NAVY WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego salesman and the local firm he represented were indicted Tuesday by 
a federal grand jury on charges that they bribed employees of the Navy Public 
Works Center. 
</P>
<P>
John D. Johnson, 43, of San Diego, and Jeyco Products Inc. were named in the 
four-count indictment, charged with offering tools and equipment to mechanics 
at the Public Works Center so the workers would recommend that the Navy buy the 
company's products. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were similar to those brought Aug. 29 against another San Diego 
salesman, Harold I. Levine, 31, and the Los Angeles firm he represented, 
Polytech Industries. Both were accused in a nine-count indictment of bribing 
the Public Works Center mechanics with electronics. 
</P>
<P>
Four Navy employees already have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of 
receiving unlawful salaries, Asst. U.S. Atty. George D. Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment returned Tuesday said Johnson offered tools and equipment to 
mechanics who maintain the Navy's refrigeration and air conditioning equipment 
in San Diego County. The Navy was to be billed for these items through inflated 
invoices, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Jeyco Products were charged with one count of conspiracy to bribe 
and three of bribery, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Johnson faces a maximum of five years in federal prison on the 
conspiracy count and 15 years apiece on each of the bribery charges, or a total 
of 50 years, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
He also faces a fine of up to $250,000 on the conspiracy charge and fines of up 
to three times the value of the bribes alleged in the three other charges, 
Hardy said. That value was not detailed. 
</P>
<P>
Jeyco faces a fine of up to $500,000 on each count, Hardy said.

BALBOA FERRY PASSENGERS LOSE FRIEND WITH DEATH OF CAPTAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
The passengers and crew on many of Tuesday's early morning Balboa Island 
ferries were weeping over the loss of one of their own. Gerry Rene, the jovial 
ferry captain who always had a joke and a smile for his passengers, was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Little by little, the news spread, silencing the ferry commuters who looked 
forward to seeing Gerry each morning. 
</P>
<P>
Rene, 33, of Corona, and his friend, Robert J. Duffield, 71, of San Diego, were 
killed Monday when Duffield's single-engine plane crashed on a rugged hillside 
near Escondido. Rene, who was divorced and had no children, leaves his mother 
and two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration investigators were examining the site Tuesday 
to determine the cause of the crash. FAA investigator Larry Lehr said there was 
a "strong possibility" that the plane broke up in flight. Plans for a memorial 
service were pending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everyone Was Crying' 
</P>
<P>
"When I got on the ferry to go to work this morning, everyone was crying," said 
Robert A. Foster, 67, an attorney who knew Rene well after years of commuting 
daily on the ferry from his Balboa Peninsula home to his office in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"The passengers and crew, everyone was crying," Foster said Tuesday. "One of 
the ladies taking the fares broke the news to me. It's just broken everybody 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Rene's supervisor at Balboa Island Ferry Co., Bob Snyder, said Rene was a 
member of the Coast Guard auxiliary, and that he believed Rene and Duffield had 
been returning from a Coast Guard-affiliated trip to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Swanson, office manager for the ferry company, said Rene had established 
an exceptional rapport with his passengers since he began making the 1,000-foot 
run between Balboa Island and the peninsula in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a cute, very well-liked fellow," she said. "Everyone who crossed 
on the ferry, Gerry knew them all by name and thought of them as family and 
friends. They all felt the same way toward him. Everyone's in shock." 
</P>
<P>
At Christmas, Rene often gave out free ferry passes that he had paid for with 
his own money, Swanson said. In exchange, he often left his boat at the end of 
his shift with an armload of home-baked cookies and cakes given to him by his 
passengers, she added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loyal Riders 
</P>
<P>
His were loyal riders. Swanson said clusters of passengers would wait on the 
dock, foregoing the other ferries that came and went every few minutes, until 
they saw Gerry at the helm, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rene "always had a joke for his passengers and knew all about the details of 
their lives," recalled Snyder, his supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his popularity, Rene told The Times in 1984 that he didn't think he 
deserved the name "captain" because his boat was "nothing more than a glorified 
barge." 
</P>
<P>
Seafaring became part of Rene's life at 14, when he entered the Sea Scouts, 
according to co-workers. He later spent four years running boats to 
oil-drilling platforms off the California coast and piloted tugboats in Long 
Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, he taught seafaring skills to boys in the Sea Scouts and coached 
teen-agers studying for their Coast Guard pilot's licenses, Snyder said.

ELKS AGAIN VOTE TO REJECT 2 BLACKS SEEKING TO JOIN VAN NUYS LODGE; 
</P>
<P>
2ND REFUSAL EXPECTED TO STIR PROTESTS OVER RACIAL POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two black men who tried to join the Van Nuys Elks Lodge were rejected Tuesday 
for the second time in two weeks in a move likely to prompt more protests 
against the fraternal organization's policies toward racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The lodge's rejection of Jules S. Bagneris III and Thomas J. Montgomery came at 
a closed meeting that drew 53 of the 370 members. Only 35 members had voted in 
last week's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Elks officials would not comment on Tuesday's vote, other than to say that the 
two men could reapply in six months. But some members said Bagneris and 
Montgomery's bid to join the white-dominated organization lost by a slim 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
Bagneris and Montgomery were sponsored for membership by state Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Tarzana), a lodge member. Rejected along with them on Tuesday was a 
Robbins aide, Jack Sheffield, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
"There was not a proper basis whatsoever" for the rejection, Robbins said. "I 
am obviously disappointed, but if the majority of the membership were here, 
they would not have condoned or participated in racism." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said he is considering transferring to the Lompoc Elks Lodge, which 
last week admitted two black members. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Van Nuys lodge said they were embarrassed by the vote but 
planned to remain in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Feel Awkward' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel awkward, but I also have friends in the Elks," said John Pulskamp, a 
member and former exalted ruler of the Van Nuys lodge. "The fact is everybody 
in the United States has at least one friend who discriminates against others 
for racial reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Davis, acting exalted ruler of the lodge, said the lodge should not be 
considered racist because "the charities we support extend to everyone, 
regardless of who they are or where they come from." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said he sponsored Bagneris and Montgomery after hearing of two black 
men whose attempt to join the Lompoc Elks Lodge sparked a months-long 
controversy over the organization's racial policies. 
</P>
<P>
The men were admitted to the Lompoc Elks Lodge last week after the Elks 
national membership decided that lodges would admit new members who could 
garner a two-thirds vote. Previously, it took only three opposing votes for a 
prospective member to be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The Elks do not admit women and voted at their national convention in July not 
to change that rule. The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, as the 
organization is officially known, has about 2,300 lodges with 1.5 million 
members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The organization does not keep statistics on the number of minorities who 
belong. But Dan Davis, a spokesman for Los Angeles-area lodges, said he knows 
of no black members in the area other than the two recently admitted to the 
Lompoc lodge. A small number of Latinos and Asians are members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bagneris, 29, is a Lake View Terrace resident and minister at an African 
Methodist Episcopal Church in El Centro who ran unsuccessfully against Los 
Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi in April. Montgomery, 67, is a World 
War II veteran and a retired state motor vehicles examiner living in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed, but I'm not disheartened," Bagneris said. 
</P>
<P>
"African-Americans historically have been despised and the struggle continues," 
he said. "This is 1989, there is no way I could expect this to occur, even in 
the San Fernando Valley. We'll have to find another means to bring about Martin 
Luther King's dream in which people are not judged by their color but by the 
content of their character."

OFFICERS CLEARED IN SHOOTINGS INVOLVING SUICIDE THREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney has exonerated two San Diego police 
officers of any criminal liability in separate shooting incidents in which two 
people were killed after threatening suicide, including a distraught woman who 
shot herself in the head during a fierce gun battle with police. 
</P>
<P>
Loretta Ann Elmore, 27, suffered a gunshot wound to her head, apparently fired 
by her own handgun, and also was shot in the right leg by Officer Peter Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
One of two reports released Tuesday by police concluded that "both wounds were 
potentially fatal" because the bullet in her leg perforated the femoral artery. 
</P>
<P>
"As likely as not, Elmore died as a result of her own accidental or suicidal 
act when she shot herself in the head," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"At the very least, this act hastened her death. It is equally likely that she 
died as a result of the gunshot fired by Officer Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
"Whichever the case, Officer Madrid's act was justified." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred June 23 near El Cajon Boulevard and Iowa Street. 
According to the district attorney's report, Elmore had been distraught for two 
weeks over losing her job. While reportedly under the influence of 
methamphetamines, she allegedly threatened some friends with her handgun, 
threatened to kill herself, and then confronted the responding police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"When Elmore turned around, Officer Madrid saw a gun in her hand," the report 
said. "At the same time, Elmore fired at Officer Madrid." 
</P>
<P>
The report said Madrid saw or heard Elmore fire two shots, that he then fired 
eleven rounds from his weapon, and that Elmore fell down on her back. Madrid 
told investigators that he believed Elmore then fired one more shot while lying 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Madrid said he answered with four or five more rounds, moved closer to her and 
then "saw Elmore fire again." In response, the officer fired an additional four 
or five more rounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Shooting 
</P>
<P>
In the second shooting, Officer Daniel Roman was cleared of any criminal 
wrongdoing in the July 8 shooting death of Lawrence Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred outside Miller's apartment in the 8200 block of Jade 
Coast Drive, where Roman and officers were dispatched after Miller began 
threatening to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
According to the district attorney's report, Miller met the officers at his 
door with a meat cleaver in one hand and a knife in the other. "As Miller 
advanced, he carried his weapons chest high, with the blades pointing at the 
officers," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Miller started moving toward Officer Roman, and when he was about six to eight 
stairsteps away, Officer Roman fired twice, hitting him twice in the abdomen. 
Miller died from his wounds." 
</P>
<P>
Roman, in an interview with police homicide investigators, described his reason 
for firing his gun. "I'm sorry," he said. "He came towards me. He wanted to get 
one of us. He had it in his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's report concluded that Miller was heavily intoxicated, and 
investigators later realized that Escondido police had three times responded to 
calls there when he had threatened suicide in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Had Officer Roman hesitated, he might have provided the few seconds necessary 
for Miller to kill or seriously injure one or more of the officers," the report 
said. "Officer Roman acted professionally, responsibly and reasonably under 
these difficult circumstances."

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: UNITED CABLE FINED $300,000 OVER DELAYS IN 
CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council fined United Cable Television $300,000 Tuesday for 
failing to meet past construction schedules. 
</P>
<P>
When United Cable won the east San Fernando Valley franchise in 1983, it 
promised to complete the system within two years. But lines were not strung 
into all of the East Valley until May, said the company's attorney, Scott 
Adler. 
</P>
<P>
The fine covers delays between January, 1988, and June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Adler blamed the delays on unrealistic deadlines, many of which were set by 
company itself. 
</P>
<P>
"United has been guilty of one thing, that is being overly optimistic about how 
fast we could build," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed to a provision, suggested by its Industry and Economic 
Development Committee, under which money collected from United Cable will go 
toward improving East Valley cable service. 
</P>
<P>
Council members asked the city Department of Telecommunications to return to 
the council Oct. 20 with a specific recommendation of how best to use the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Herman, general manager of the department, said United Cable has been 
fined more than $1 million for delays, nearly half of which was waived after 
the company persuaded council members that they had not understood some of the 
regulations regarding the stringing of lines on Department of Water and Power 
poles. 
</P>
<P>
Herman said the company has already paid $236,200.

POLICE SAY MAN DIDN'T MEAN SCHOOLYARD SHOOTING THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER and MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Woodland Hills man arrested Monday after allegedly threatening to use a 
firearm to quiet noisy schoolchildren apparently did not intend to follow 
through, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Allan Munt, 36, told police he was angry that noise from an elementary 
school near his home was keeping his terminally ill father from sleeping. Munt 
lives with his elderly parents. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time, we have no indications that he intended to follow through with 
the threat," Los Angeles Police Lt. William Gaida said. "I'm sure he regrets 
making the statement. People say things when they are angry." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office Tuesday charged Munt with one 
felony count of making a threat against a school official, said Capt. John 
Higgins, commander of the Police Department's West Valley Division. If 
convicted, Munt could face a $10,000 fine and up to a year in jail. He is free 
on $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School Letting Out 
</P>
<P>
Munt was arrested after he went to Calabash Street School about 2:50 p.m. and 
told an official to order the children to be quiet. School was letting out and 
students were boarding buses and waiting for rides in front of the school, 
which is across the street from Munt's home in the 4700 block of Degovia 
Avenue, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Told that it would be difficult to make the children be quiet, Munt allegedly 
replied, "If you don't do it, I'm going to get my AK-47 and I'll take care of 
it," Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
Munt has no criminal record and doesn't fit the profile of someone who would 
follow through on his threat, Higgins said. Munt has no guns registered to him 
and a search of his house turned up no weapon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police also said Munt has no history of complaining about the school. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators and police met with about 50 parents at the school 
Tuesday in an attempt to alleviate their fears. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Order Possible 
</P>
<P>
Jack Jacobson, region administrator, said the Los Angeles Unified School 
District will "pursue the possibility" of trying to obtain a court order 
preventing Munt from coming on the school campus. He said the district will 
provide funds to hire a full-time aide to check the identification of anyone 
entering the school's front gate. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Block, who has a son at the school, said he believes school officials and 
police handled the situation responsibly. He suggested that parents send a 
letter to Munt to let him know they are in sympathy with his plight in caring 
for his father. 
</P>
<P>
Another parent, Nick Coates, said he was shocked that Munt was out of jail 
Tuesday morning and urged school officials holding Tuesday's meeting to inform 
as many parents as possible about the facts of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Munt could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the school has rerouted buses to the back of the campus to try to 
reduce noise near Munt's home, said site administrator Marge Roten. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking parents to pick up their children there, too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they will provide extra patrols at the campus.

TRAVEL AGENCY SLAYING, 2 ROBBERIES MAY BE LINKED TO TICKET SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robberies in the last week at two San Fernando Valley travel agencies -- 
including one in which an owner was fatally shot -- are believed to be part of 
a series of similar robberies in which the thieves have taken blank airline 
tickets worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, Los Angeles police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said robbers armed with handguns have taken cash and tickets from at 
least 20 travel agencies throughout Los Angeles County since the beginning of 
the year, but no shots had been fired until Friday, when the owner of a Van 
Nuys agency was shot during an afternoon robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Hernan Vacha was shot once in the upper body during the robbery at 
Excelsior Travel &amp; Tours in the 14400 block of Victory Boulevard, about two 
blocks from the Van Nuys police station. Vacha, 46, died Saturday night at 
Valley Medical Center in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Arrests 
</P>
<P>
No arrests had been made in the slaying or the robberies. The latest was 
committed by three armed men who took an undisclosed amount of cash and blank 
tickets Monday from Ampavera Tours &amp; Travel in the 18600 block of Sherman 
Way in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley robberies featured a new level of violence in the robberies and 
enlarged the area in which businesses have been victimized, police said. In the 
past, robberies have occurred as far south as Inglewood and as far east as El 
Monte. Although some occurred as far north as Van Nuys, most took place south 
of the Valley. The Canoga Park robbery was the first in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a new thing and it is escalating," Detective Larry Hedwall said. "We 
have had numerous robberies all over the county since the end of last year." 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, two or three armed robbers entered the businesses during daytime 
hours and took cash and tickets after threatening employees. Police said they 
have received several different descriptions from victims, leading them to 
believe that different but possibly linked groups of robbers are involved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selling Methods 
</P>
<P>
The links between the robbers may be in the methods or individuals used to sell 
the blank tickets, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
Forgery Detective Bob Hill said stolen tickets are routinely sold to 
unsuspecting travelers through newspaper ads or in bulk quantities to networks 
that arrange travel for illegal aliens who have been smuggled into Southern 
California and are heading east. He said tickets stolen from Los Angeles 
agencies have also been traced to Europe where they were distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said that thieves use sophisticated methods, including computer printers, 
stolen airline stamps and knowledge of airline ticket coding, to fill out the 
blank airline tickets for specific flights -- often expensive routes that bring 
more profit to the thieves. Phony reservations are then made with the airlines 
to make sure that seats are open on the flights. 
</P>
<P>
Those who travel on the tickets often do not know that they have been stolen, 
he said, although some of those who buy tickets through classified ads are told 
that they are legitimate cut-rate tickets -- which airlines specify cannot be 
resold -- and so the buyer must fly under the identity of the "original 
purchaser." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Checks 
</P>
<P>
Users of the tickets usually are not stopped at airports unless airline 
employees take the time to run computer checks on the serial numbers of their 
tickets, Hill said. Rarely are the actual thieves arrested. The airlines -- or 
passengers notified at the last moment that their tickets are invalid -- suffer 
the loss, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said that for years thieves have used various ruses to steal small amounts 
of blank tickets from travel agencies, but the rash of armed robberies this 
year is a disturbing and dangerous new trend that has largely grown out of the 
lucrative market for the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the travel agencies robbed this year usually had 100 to 250 blank 
tickets stolen and that those recovered after use indicate the thieves profit 
an average of $1,000 from each one. 
</P>
<P>
"The losses can be staggering," he said. "The airlines could lose $100,000 in 
each robbery."

MOTORCYCLIST KILLED IN WRONG-WAY FREEWAY COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A motorcyclist was killed when he was struck by a car driven by a drunk driver 
the wrong way on the Golden State Freeway in Santa Clarita, the California 
Highway Patrol reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 10 p.m. Monday in the northbound lanes of the freeway, 
just north of the Magic Mountain Parkway exit, the CHP said. The dead man had 
not been identified by investigators. The driver of the car and another 
motorcyclist were slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Mark Fessia said a car driven by Scott T. Fedunak, 22, of Van Nuys, 
spun out on the rain-slicked freeway and blocked two northbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Ferdon, 51, of Castaic, driving north on his motorcycle, put the cycle 
into a slide to avoid hitting Fedunak's car. He was slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
Fessia said that Fedunak then backed his car up and started driving south on 
the northbound lanes. A short distance from the first accident he struck 
another motorcycle head-on. 
</P>
<P>
"Witnesses said the motorcycle appeared to explode on impact," Fessia said. 
"The rider was ejected" and killed. 
</P>
<P>
The second accident left Fedunak with minor injuries. He and Ferdon were 
treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia. Fedunak was 
arrested for felony drunk driving and was being held at Los Angeles County jail 
in lieu of $2,500 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Fessia said an investigation is continuing and Fedunak could face a 
manslaughter charge.

MOORE REGAINS FORM, WINS HIS 18TH FOR A'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A month ago, Mike Moore appeared to be a cinch to win 20 games and the Oakland 
Athletics appeared to be a cinch to win the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, the hard-throwing right-hander the Athletics signed as a free agent last 
winter, won his 16th game on Aug. 20. Moore had held the Minnesota Twins to 
four hits in eight innings and had pitched the A's into a virtual tie for 
first. 
</P>
<P>
But Moore went into a slump, which is probably why the Athletics are still 
trying to nail down their second consecutive division title. 
</P>
<P>
Moore lost four of his next five decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The slump ended Tuesday night at Cleveland and Moore, who lost 34 games in his 
last two seasons at Seattle, still has a shot at 20 victories this season. 
</P>
<P>
Moore held the Indians to two hits and an unearned run in a 5-1 victory that 
enabled the Athletics to remain 2 1/2 games ahead of the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
His control problems apparently ended, Moore walked only one. He lost his 
shutout in the sixth when right fielder Jose Canseco dropped Felix Fermin's fly 
ball for a two-base error. Fermin eventually scored on an error by second 
baseman Tony Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Moore (18-10) set personal highs for victories and did not allow an earned run 
for the 11th time in 33 starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I had been putting too much pressure on myself," Moore said. "I 
pretended it was April. So, I went out and pitched the way I did in April. It 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco made up for his error by getting two hits, including a run-scoring 
double in the fourth inning, and scored twice. DAN HAFNER

GIANTS BEAT DODGERS ON A BIG HIT BY LITTLE-KNOWN LAGA

There's a funny, enduring thing about baseball pennant races. They rarely look 
like pennant races. Coming after seven months of games, they are sometimes 
tired, sometimes slow, rarely glistening with a Gold Glove or thrilling with a 
Cy Young. 
</P>
<P>
Look long enough and you'll realize, penannt races mostly look like guys named 
Mike Laga. The Dodgers discovered this last year, and the Giants realized it 
again Tuesday night in front of 20,668 Candlestick Park fans who won't soon 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing the Dodgers, 2-0, in the fifth inning, the Giants had loaded the bases 
against Orel Hershiser with two out when, to the shock of anyone who can count 
to four, Matt Williams was removed for a pinch hitter. This was the same 
Williams who has 16 homers and 43 RBIs in just 74 games, including a grand slam 
against these Dodgers last month. 
</P>
<P>
The substitute? A 29-year-old career minor-leaguer named Laga, a man blessed 
with eight big-league at-bats this season. 
</P>
<P>
For a few moments, there was silence. Then there were cheers that Laga will 
probably hear until October, as he drove a Hershiser pitch against the 
right-field wall, clearing the bases and giving the Giants a 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The National League West leaders maintain a five-game lead over San Diego, with 
just 11 games remaining. And at least on this night, the hero was a guy who 
will you won't find anywhere near the names Mitchell and Clark in the Giants 
media guide. 
</P>
<P>
Laga, if he wasn't in the section with the other Giants minor leaguers, would 
be listed in the guide right next to Mike Lacoss in the regular section. Lacoss 
is the pitcher who tried to give the game away Tuesday, allowing 11 hits in 
five innings. He was officially the winning pitcher, but was saved by four 
innings of scoreless relief by Craig Lefferts and Steve Bedrosian. 
</P>
<P>
The loser, for the 14th time in 28 decisions, was Hershiser. He has only 
himself to blame for the fifth, in which he allowed a leadoff single to 
pinch-hitter Ken Oberkfell and walks to Brett Butler and Will Clark to cause 
all the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
And how his teammates tried to offer him more than the four runs they had given 
him in his previous seven winless starts. They scored half that amount in 
Tuesday's first inning, on two infield singles and three bloop singles, 
featuring RBIs by Mike Marshall and Lenny Harris. 
</P>
<P>
But in the second inning, after reaching first on a surprise bunt single, Mike 
Scioscia ran the Dodgers out of the rally by unsuccessfully trying to reach 
third base on an Alfredo Griffin single. And in the fourth, Hershiser failed to 
get down a good sacrifice bunt after a leadoff single by John Shelby. And in 
the seventh, Eddie Murray turned a one-out single to right field into a second 
out by trying, and failing, to turn it into a double. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Hershiser was left with a 14-14 record, an 0-6 record since Aug. 8, 
and a bad taste for guys named Laga. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't like Laga has not done this before. All four of his hits since his 
September recall have driven in runs. In his first at-bat as a Giant, on Sept. 
4 in Cincinnati, he hit a two-run homer to begin a rally from an 8-0 deficit. 
He later drove in the winning run with a single in a 9-8 victory that many have 
credited with being the start of the Giants stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
But having jumped from the major leagues to the minor leagues for the last 
eight years, Laga can be excused for being excited about this. And so the 
Dodgers likely did not mind, and the Giants fans loved it, when after his 
double he made like a wide receive in an end zone. He ran in from second base 
following his removal for a pinch runner with his helmet held high in his left 
hand, and his left hand pumping. 
</P>
<P>
When the crowd wouldn't sit, he re-appeared from the dugout and pumped his 
helmet again. It was enough to collapse the Dodgers for the remaining four 
innings, which ended on Brett Butler's diving catch of an Eddie Murray line 
drive with Griffin on first after a single. Pennant races, you see, can also 
look like guys named Butler. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher's season has likely ended after he left Candlestick Park before 
Tuesday's game with what was diagnosed by Giants' physician Dr. Will Straw as a 
hernia. Hacther probably suffered it while lifting furniture at his home. 
Hatcher returned to Los Angeles this morning where he will be examined by 
Dodger team physician, Dr. Michael Mellman. Hatcher never fully recovered from 
a strained left hamstring that sidelined him for 15 days in August. He was 
batting .322 when he came off the disabled list Aug. 21, but since then, he had 
gone 10 for 48 (.208) to drop his average to .297 in 91 games . . . Mike Davis, 
who can pinch hit but still can't play the outfield because of a sore left 
knee, said he was considering playing for one of the two Dodger teams in the 
Arizona Instructional League after the season. "I still can't sprint, and I 
need to find some way to get this leg better for next season," said Davis, who 
has no idea where he will play next season. His contract expires but, because 
he was a free agent two seasons ago, he cannot be a free agent unless the 
Dodgers release him. He said he will discuss the situation with Dodger 
officials in a couple of weeks. "Los Angeles is a great place to play, with 
emphasis on the phrase, 'place to play,' " Davis said. "I've been sitting for 
two years, and that's sad. That's a whole lot of stuff down the drain. More 
than anything, next year I need to play." . . . Alfredo Griffin is one of the 
club's five Dominican Republic natives who was worried about the effects of 
Hurricane Hugo on his island. "You get used to those kinds of things happening 
over there," he said. "But the island is not in good shape anyway, and every 
time something like this hits, it gets worse and worse."

There's a funny thing about baseball pennant races. They sometimes don't look 
like pennant races. 
</P>
<P>
Look closely enough and you will notice, pennant races sometimes look like guys 
named Mike Laga. The Giants realized that Tuesday night in a 3-2 victory over 
the Dodgers in front of 20,668 at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 2-0, in the fifth inning, the Giants loaded the bases with two out 
against Orel Hershiser. To the shock of anyone who can count to four, Matt 
Williams was removed for a pinch-hitter. This was the same Williams who has 16 
homers and 43 runs batted in in just 74 games, including a grand slam against 
the Dodgers last month. 
</P>
<P>
The substitute? A 29-year-old career minor leaguer named Laga. 
</P>
<P>
For a few moments, there was silence. Then there were cheers that Laga will 
probably hear until October, as he drove a pitch by Hershiser against the 
right-field wall for a double, clearing the bases and giving the Giants the 
eventual victory. 
</P>
<P>
The National League West leaders, maintaining a five-game lead over the San 
Diego Padres with just 11 games remaining, have a magic number of seven. And 
they have a magic man who celebrated the biggest hit of his career as if he 
were a wide receiver in an end zone. 
</P>
<P>
After being removed for a pinch-runner, Laga ran off the field pumping his 
helmet into the air with his left hand. When the crowd wouldn't sit, he 
reappeared and pumped his helmet again. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a curtain call before," an embarrassed Laga acknowledged. "But 
I've seen Kevin Mitchell and Will Clark do enough to know how." 
</P>
<P>
In the other clubhouse, Hershiser shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of thing that happens in championship seasons," he said. "You 
get big efforts from young guys and role players. I know because it happened to 
us a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has lost six consecutive decisions -- his last win was Aug. 8 -- 
this was a different night for Hershiser. For once, his loss was his own fault. 
</P>
<P>
Staked to a two-run lead in the first inning -- more runs than the offense had 
scored for him in his previous five starts combined -- Hershiser simply gave it 
back. He started the fifth by giving up a leadoff single to pinch-hitter Ken 
Oberkfell, who is hitting .313 in 72 games since joining the team from the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. Then he walked Brett Butler. 
</P>
<P>
A bad bunt by Robby Thompson forced Oberkfell at third, but then Hershiser 
walked Will Clark, loading the bases. A big strikeout of Kevin Mitchell later, 
Hershiser looked strong. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams, two-for-17 lifetime against Hershiser, was summoned back to the 
bench. Laga, who had been in the on-deck circle the previous inning until the 
Giants' third out, was ready. 
</P>
<P>
The batter and pitcher had never faced each other, but Hershiser, who fell 
behind him 2-and-0, said it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no creative way to pitch with the bases loaded, no matter who is up -- 
Will Clark, Babe Ruth or Mike Laga," he said. "Then when you fall behind 
2-and-0, no scouting report will help." 
</P>
<P>
Laga remembers only that he hit a sinker. The rest, well, "Let's just say I was 
a happy camper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this being a pennant race, it isn't as if Laga hasn't won a game for 
the Giants before. All four of his hits since his September recall have driven 
in runs. 
</P>
<P>
In his first at-bat as a Giant, Sept. 4 in Cincinnati, he hit a two-run homer 
to begin a rally from an 8-0 deficit. He later drove in the winning run with a 
single in a 9-8 victory that many have credited with being the start of the 
Giants' stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
He may not be feeling all that great in a couple of weeks, because he was 
recalled from triple-A Phoenix Sept. 1 and won't be eligible for the playoffs. 
But having jumped from the major leagues to the minor leagues for the last 
eight years, he'll adjust. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've always been behind somebody," he said, "you're grateful for any 
chance to show what you can do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Giant starter Mike LaCoss (8-10), who allowed 11 hits in five innings, was the 
winning pitcher -- his first win since Aug. 11 -- but was saved by four innings 
of scoreless relief by Craig Lefferts and Steve Bedrosian. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher's season probably ended after he left Candlestick Park before 
Tuesday's game with what was diagnosed by Giants' physician Will Straw as a 
hernia. Hatcher probably suffered it while lifting furniture at his home. 
Hatcher returned to Los Angeles this morning where he will be examined by 
Dodger team physician Michael Mellman. Hatcher never fully recovered from a 
strained left hamstring that sidelined him for 15 days in August. He was 
batting .322 when he came off the disabled list Aug. 21, but since then, he had 
gone 10 for 48 (.208) to drop his average to .297 in 91 games. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Davis, who can pinch-hit but still can't play the outfield because of a 
sore left knee, said he was considering playing for one of the two Dodger teams 
in the Arizona Instructional League after the season. "I still can't sprint, 
and I need to find some way to get this leg better for next season," said 
Davis, who has no idea where he will play next season. His contract expires 
but, because he was a free agent two seasons ago, he cannot be a free agent 
unless the Dodgers release him. He said he will discuss the situation with 
Dodger officials in a couple of weeks but hinted that he wouldn't want to 
return unless he has a chance to play."Los Angeles is a great place to play, 
with emphasis on the phrase, 'place to play,' " Davis said. "I've been sitting 
for two years, and that's sad."

GOODEN INJECTS LIFE INTO METS AS CUBS FALL, 5-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>
<P>
Dwight Gooden is healthy at last, but it might be too late to save the New York 
Mets, a team in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours after Manager Davey Johnson disciplined two top players, Kevin 
McReynolds and Darryl Strawberry, Gooden returned to form. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden, in his second appearance since being sidelined for more than two months 
because of a torn shoulder muscle, held the Cubs to three hits in four innings 
Tuesday at Chicago to save the Mets' 5-2 victory. With a split in the two-game 
series, the Mets, who have 12 games to play, trail the first-place Cubs by 5 
1/2 games in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Carter, who had not hit a home run in five months, hit a three-run homer 
off Steve Wilson in the second inning to back Bob Ojeda (13-10). Ojeda held the 
Cubs to a run and four hits before Gooden took over. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets won without Strawberry and McReynolds. Both were benched and fined 
because they left the dugout and went to the clubhouse in the ninth inning of 
Monday night's 10-6 loss to the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
They were getting ready to take early showers when the Mets rallied for two 
runs and had the bases loaded. Strawberry, hurriedly summoned to take his turn 
at bat, struck out to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The incident is closed now," Johnson said. "But I was angry and disappointed 
at what they did. I've never been so upset in my life." 
</P>
<P>
However, Newsday reported that a shouting match occurred between Johnson and 
Strawberry in the Mets' clubhouse about an hour before Tuesday's game. The 
incident occurred in front of the entire team and at least one player had to 
step between the two to prevent a fistfight, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing could take away from Gooden's enthusiasm. Originally, after 
pitching three shutout innings last Wednesday, Gooden had been expected to 
start Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But he warmed up Saturday late in the game without doing any stretching 
exercises and experienced some soreness. 
</P>
<P>
After his four-inning stint Tuesday, he said: "I feel good, great. I'm hoping 
my next appearance will be a start." 
</P>
<P>
Ojeda had given up only two hits before Domingo Ramos and Shawon Dunston 
singled to open the sixth. Gooden was summoned and Ryne Sandberg hit into a 
double play on his first pitch. The Cubs scored off him in the eighth after 
Dwight Smith tripled. 
</P>
<P>
Cub Manager Don Zimmer was not worried. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew if we won one in the series we couldn't get hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 5, Montreal 0 -- Bob Tewksbury, only a few years ago a top prospect 
with the New York Yankees, gave the riddled Cardinal pitching staff a big lift 
at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Tewksbury, who spent this season in triple-A ball, pitched a four-hitter and 
singled in a run as the Cardinals moved to within four games of the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Guerrero hit his 17th home run of the season for the Cardinals and Tom 
Brunansky had his 20th. It is the eighth consecutive season that Brunansky has 
hit at least 20. 
</P>
<P>
As a rookie in 1986, Tewksbury, who will be 30 in November, was 9-5 for the 
Yankees. But arm problems, which slowed his progress early in his career, 
cropped up again in 1987, when he was 1-8 with the Yankees and Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 6, Boston 5 -- All the Blue Jays have to do to win the American League 
East is get the game into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
Although they twice fell behind after the ninth inning, the Blue Jays, on a 
two-out double by Nelson Liriano with the bases loaded, came from behind in the 
13th inning to win their fifth consecutive extra-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox had gone in front in the 10th inning, only to see Ernie Whitt get a 
two-out single that drove in the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
In the 13th, Wade Boggs, mired in a two-for-28 slump that has probably cost him 
his fifth consecutive batting title, hit a sacrifice fly to put Boston ahead, 
5-4. 
</P>
<P>
When third baseman Boggs threw out a runner at the plate trying to score on a 
grounder for the second out in the bottom of the 13th, it appeared the Blue 
Jays were about to lose. But Lee Mazzilli walked to load the bases and Liriano 
delivered. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays remained two games ahead of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 6, Detroit 2 -- Going into this game at Baltimore, the bottom three 
hitters in the Orioles' lineup were in a three-for-40 slump. 
</P>
<P>
But Craig Worthington, Jamie Quirk and Tim Hulett provided the punch for the 
Orioles' third victory in their last four games. 
</P>
<P>
Worthington and Hulett hit home runs, and Quirk had a double and drove in two 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 5, Cincinnati 1 -- Rookie Andy Benes won his fifth in a row and Mark 
Davis earned his 40th save at Cincinnati as the Reds lost their eighth in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 3, Houston 0 -- Gary Eave, in his major league debut, outpitched 
20-game winner Mike Scott at Atlanta. Eave gave up two hits in 7 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, Philadelphia 2 -- Gary Redus and Jose Lind each had three hits at 
Pittsburgh to lead the Pirates to their ninth victory in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 5, Seattle 3 -- Brad Arnsberg gave up two hits in 5 2/3 innings of relief 
to win it. DAN HAFNER

CHANGING STRIPES;

<P>
ONCE STEADFASTLY OPPOSED, KATHY CHRISTIAN OF WEST HILLS NOW RELISHES THE THRILL 
OF THE HUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kathy Christian performs all the usual household duties each weekend at her 
family's two-story West Hills home. She vacuums the carpets. She does the 
laundry. She washes the kitchen floor. She dusts the wildebeest. 
</P>
<P>
And, if time allows, she brushes the mouflon sheep, runs a damp rag over the 
horns of the greater kudu and straightens out the zebra-skin (and head) rug 
that adorns her dining-room floor. 
</P>
<P>
This is no collection of moth-eaten relics salvaged from a pawn shop. These are 
genuine big-game trophies taken while on safari, and that they occupy wall 
space at the Christian home is rather remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
Up until about a year ago, Christian, 42, was a woman steadfastly opposed to 
hunting. But with one not-so-perfect but still fatal shot from a .280-caliber 
rifle on a scorching African day in August last year, she became a hunter. 
</P>
<P>
The transformation was extraordinary -- and one that Christian finds difficult 
to explain. 
</P>
<P>
Most people who have not hunted by the time they reach the age of 40 don't 
change course. It is a sport instilled in youth by a hunting father or 
grandfather, most commonly in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
"For all of my life I was an anti-hunter," Christian said. "When my husband 
went hunting, I would actually pray that the animals got away." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for several animals that once roamed the South African veld and, 
most recently, a black bear that inhabited the woods of Alberta, Canada, 
Christian no longer feels that way about hunters. 
</P>
<P>
In the months since her first kill, she has gone -- without her husband, Fred 
-- on hunts in Spain, where she took a fallow deer, and Alberta, where she 
overcame the hardships of a backcountry tent camp for a successful shot at a 
bear. 
</P>
<P>
For 24 years, Fred Christian endured the wrath of his anti-hunting wife. A trip 
to Colorado to hunt deer would bring weeks of silent and not-so-silent protest. 
</P>
<P>
As a hunter since boyhood, Fred understood the anti-hunting sentiment, 
especially in a place such as Los Angeles, which long ago abandoned any 
pretense of being anything but an enormous slab of cement upon which several 
million people live. 
</P>
<P>
So he suffered the anti-hunting abuse silently. Always, he said, he wished his 
wife would try to understand his love of the hunt, his love of the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
But, it seemed, that was not to be. 
</P>
<P>
"My idea of roughing it was going someplace in a motor home that didn't have a 
microwave oven," Kathy Christian said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she was persuaded to accompany her husband on an African safari. She 
would shoot big game, she said, but not with a rifle. Her shots would come from 
a camera. 
</P>
<P>
The dust swirled and the midday heat was at full bore now on the Thabazimbi 
plains of South Africa. Kathy Christian crouched at the base of a gnarled and 
twisted tree and felt her heart pound as a herd of antelope swept across the 
flat, grassy land. The first few were females, prancing nervously as their 
noses probed the air for danger. Seconds later, two males emerged from the 
brush. And Christian's heart raced as she brought her massive rifle down and 
rested the barrel against the tree. 
</P>
<P>
With an eye pressed to the scope, she scanned the distant bush. The cross hairs 
found the first male impala, but he passed quickly. A second later, the other 
male -- a much bigger specimen -- filled the scope. And, with only a gentle 
urging from her guide, she pulled the trigger and sent a bullet slamming into 
the animal. 
</P>
<P>
And then, it ran. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt no remorse about shooting him," Christian said. "But I did feel bad 
that I didn't kill him instantly. When he ran and we couldn't find him, I just 
felt terrible. I thought how he must be suffering." 
</P>
<P>
The guide and Christian searched the plains for a long time and found no trace 
of the animal. Finally, they found it, no more than 40 yards from where it was 
shot, stiffening already as its lifeless body slumped against some dried 
shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'Thank God it's over,' " Christian said. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later Christian took down a blesbok -- an antelope indigenous to 
that area -- and it wasn't pretty. Her shot was not a killing shot and had only 
immobilized the 200-pound animal. She had to walk up to it and finish it off 
with a round into its chest from only 10 feet away. The impact made the 
blesbok's body lurch backward. 
</P>
<P>
And Christian looked into the animal's eyes the entire time. 
</P>
<P>
"He was looking at me," she said. "I felt really terrible." 
</P>
<P>
The next day a male zebra fell to her gun. It was traveling, according to the 
guide, with two females that had, earlier in the week, been accompanying 
another male zebra, this one shot and killed by Fred Christian. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Christians took seven animals in those two weeks. Among their kill 
was a Cape eland that weighed about 1,500 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
And all of those animals, along with others taken by Fred, are nailed solidly 
to the walls of their living room, eyes wide open as they seem to gaze out over 
the room. Often, their view is of the television set as it plays videotapes of 
the hunt that marked the animals' final day. 
</P>
<P>
It is a somewhat eerie feeling, sitting in the room watching a Cape eland who 
is, it seems, watching himself being shot. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year Kathy went on the fallow deer hunt by herself in Spain. And in 
May, she and a woman companion who is a longtime member of Safari Club 
International, went to a remote site near Edmonton, Alberta. Christian dropped 
a 350-pound black bear that had been lured into her shooting zone by a mound of 
rotting food. 
</P>
<P>
And if all of this makes a person want to stand up and shout, "Please. Stop 
shooting everything!" ... well, Kathy understands. 
</P>
<P>
"When I shot my first animal, the impala, I felt no remorse at all," she said. 
"And I was shocked that I didn't feel that sadness that I thought I would. I 
felt guilty that I didn't feel guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"After I did it, all I could think was, 'I have to have that animal. I have to 
have it mounted and bring it home. It's mine.' That's why this room is filled 
with animals. Because both Fred and I want to have those heads as a lasting 
memory of what we did, of being out there with those animals, seeing the beauty 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
There has been a somewhat nasty reaction among members of the Christian family 
to Kathy's new-found passion. Her mother, for example, strongly suggested that 
she find something else to do until the anxiety of mid-life crisis fades away. 
</P>
<P>
A sister believes, Kathy said, that she is absolutely crazy. 
</P>
<P>
And a daughter, Trish, 20, has to fight a feeling of nausea each time she 
passes through the living room. Which, by the way, she doesn't do very often 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like hunting or anything associated with it," said Trish. "I'm 
preparing to be a firefighter. I think it's important to save life, not take it 
away. I am an animal lover. 
</P>
<P>
"When all those heads came home, I moved out." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, she did. One day this summer she strolled in, saw the heads of a 
mouflon sheep and a Corsican sheep that had been shot by dad, and headed out 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
"She called us from a phone booth and said she wasn't coming home until they 
were off the wall," Kathy recalled. "The heads stayed up, and she didn't come 
home that night." 
</P>
<P>
For all the people who don't understand, for all the people who refuse to even 
try to understand, for all the anti-hunters, Christian has no bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
She was, she remembers, one of them. "I see women wearing animal-skin shoes and 
they criticize hunting," she said. "I see women in seal coats and beaver-skin 
coats, and they criticize hunting. I know I used to be like that. And now I 
know that those people just don't see it. They just don't get the whole picture 
of animals and hunting. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago I ran over a little rabbit on a road in Moorpark. I got out 
and looked at the little thing and I cried about it for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"And if I ran over a rabbit today, I would cry just as hard." 
</P>

WELCH SPEAKS LIKE A BEATEN MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canyon High will lose to Thousand Oaks on Friday night. You heard it here 
first. And from none other than Harry Welch. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to win," said Welch, the Canyon coach. "It's the truth." 
</P>
<P>
A psychological ploy by Welch? A ruse to rouse his players? A smoke screen from 
which the Cowboys will emerge to smoke Thousand Oaks, the No. 2-ranked team in 
the Valley area? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Welch had better think of something. For the second consecutive year, 
Canyon will enter its traditionally competitive nonleague game against the 
Lancers with an 0-2 record. And for the first time in Welch's eight-year 
tenure, the Cowboys may lose three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon has lost to Hart, 30-12, and Bakersfield, 24-14, while rushing for a 
combined 74 yards. Thousand Oaks (2-0), meanwhile, is the Valley's top 
defensive team, having posted 27-0 wins over both San Marcos and Buena while 
surrendering a combined 87 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Good thinking, Harry. Fire up those Cowboys. Make those Lancers fall on their 
face masks with overconfidence. Sly, really sly. 
</P>
<P>
"Seriously, we're not going to beat them," Welch said. "I told the kids that 
going to Bakersfield. We made great improvements and I was pleased. We played 
with more confidence and intensity. It wasn't a bad bus ride home and it wasn't 
a bad experience for the kids in films the next day. We're getting better." 
</P>
<P>
But Thousand Oaks, or so Welch insists, is just too good. 
</P>
<P>
"They're playing like champions. They are together and bright and they hustle. 
If I coached them, I'd be so happy and proud and excited. I won't be ashamed to 
lose to them, but I hope we're not embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
"I promise you, I'm going to coach as hard as I can and do everything to help 
the kids. But we're not going to win." 
</P>
<P>
Add Canyon: Welch overlooks, perhaps by choice, one aspect of the match-up. 
Canyon holds a decided edge in the passing department. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Tim Beidle, somewhat surprisingly, is the Valley's top passer, having 
completed 38 of 62 passes (61%) for 493 yards and two touchdowns. Wide receiver 
Clint Beauer, one of the best in the state, is the Valley's leading receiver, 
with 21 catches for 307 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
But Welch sees the dark cloud within every silver lining. Beauer, he said, was 
stifled by Thousand Oaks senior cornerback Jim Magallanes in summer 
passing-league games. Magallanes, one of the top defensive backs in the Valley, 
had two interceptions against Buena. 
</P>
<P>
"He shut Beauer down," Welch said. "It's hard to catch the ball when a guy is 
in your jock." 
</P>
<P>
Back in motion: Tailback Mike Lindsay, who rushed for 1,046 yards for Thousand 
Oaks as a junior, has been practicing and likely will see playing time Friday 
night, Coach Bob Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay injured his knee but has been quick to recover from this summer's 
arthroscopic surgery. Richards added that Lindsay should be "full go" when the 
Lancers open Marmonte League play Sept. 29 against Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
A new alternative: After an unusual experiment in which Granada Hills 
alternated quarterbacks on each down in last week's 17-14 victory over 
Westchester, co-Coach Tom Harp has concluded that it is time to decide. And it 
looks like junior Bryan Martin, a transfer from Illinois, will replace last 
year's starter, Chris Gadomski, as the No. 1 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Gadomski started against Westchester and completed four of 10 passes for 39 
yards. Martin was two of five for 29 yards and threw an interception. "It's 
tough to bench the returning starter, but I think Martin is the quarterback of 
the future for us," Harp said. 
</P>
<P>
Harp will decide after Thursday's practice on a starter for Friday's game 
against Franklin, saying he is leaning toward Martin. The starter might play 
for the game's duration, Harp said. 
</P>
<P>
Harp insists that the quarterback controversy has not affected the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the battle has pushed both players and they get along fine," he said. 
"The rest of the team is willing to support either one." 
</P>
<P>
True Spartans: While tailback Jerome Casey is the focus of the Sylmar football 
team this fall, the defense is quietly preparing for a big year. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jeff Engilman said that in a scrimmage Friday against Cleveland, the 
defense picked off six passes, three by linebacker London Woodfin. 
</P>
<P>
Woodfin, a converted tight end who stands 6-3, 225 and bench presses nearly 400 
pounds, is a Division I prospect, according to Engilman. 
</P>
<P>
Disciplined: The top seven runners from Antelope Valley's cross-country team 
were suspended for last Saturday's Woodbridge Invitational after an apparent 
run-in with local police in the San Luis Obispo area Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelopes competed in the Morro Bay Invitational at Morro Bay High that 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"They terrorized the town," Coach Robert Terrill said. "So I decided to make 
them think about (their actions)." 
</P>

STATWATCH: DEFENSE OF THOUSAND OAKS ZEROES IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As difficult a chore as it might have seemed, the Thousand Oaks High defense 
has exceeded expectations through its first two games. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers have eight starters back from a unit that was among the Valley 
area's best last season. And now, another year older, another year stronger and 
another year wiser, the defense is even more ferocious than expected. 
</P>
<P>
After a pair of 27-0 victories, the Lancers have allowed 87 total yards and 
just 16.5 yards per game rushing. Only one rushing play has been longer than 10 
yards, and in 21 of 43 rushing plays, the ballcarrier has been either stopped 
for no gain or thrown for a loss. 
</P>
<P>
In 71 offensive plays, only two netted as many as 10 yards. And with the two 
shutouts, Thousand Oaks already has matched last season's total, as well as 
that of 1987 when it was the Southern Section Coastal Conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
Offense: Canyon can't seem to run the ball, but the Cowboys sure can pass it. 
After two games, Canyon (0-2) has passed for 493 yards, more than any Valley 
team. But the Cowboys have rushed for only 74 yards, including a whopping two 
yards last Friday against Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
In two games, Notre Dame tailback Errol Small has averaged 9.6 yards a carry 
and has rushed for four touchdowns. His numbers would be even more impressive 
had not three touchdown runs been nullified by penalties. Small has been reeled 
back on scoring runs of 75, 64 and 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, Alemany sophomores Terry Barnum and Brian Brison were 
expected to form one of the better backfields in the Valley. But the running 
game has yet to kick in; the pair have combined for just 131 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Defense: Crespi gave up 238 yards rushing but just 12 yards passing in its 17-7 
opening loss to Redlands. In their 21-13 win over Hart, the Celts allowed 13 
yards rushing and 199 yards in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous: The Marmonte League is a less-than-impressive 4-5-1 against 
Channel League opponents, 0-5-1 if wins by Thousand Oaks and Channel Islands 
are excluded. Westlake and Camarillo each have lost twice. . . . Three Marmonte 
teams rank among the Valley area's top 10 defenses. Thousand Oaks is No. 1, 
Newbury Park is No. 3 and Royal is No. 7. Westlake, which has surrendered 859 
yards in two games, ranks last. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's 16-0 loss to La Canada did little to bolster Glendale's ailing 
numbers. The Dynamiters managed five yards passing and 61 yards on the ground. 
They have 65 yards rushing and 195 yards passing in two games.

BEST SHOWING IN OVER 3 YEARS; DECLINE IN ENERGY SECTOR HELPS CAP INFLATION

The rise in consumer prices halted abruptly in August after slowing during most 
of the summer, marking the nation's best performance on inflation in more than 
three years, the government reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The respite -- the first month since April, 1986, that the consumer price index 
remained unchanged -- mainly reflected a 4.2% plunge in gasoline prices that 
helped offset increases in other prices. The decline in energy prices was the 
steepest in three years. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third month in a row that declining energy prices have kept 
inflation low at the retail level. The consumer price index rose a relatively 
modest 0.2% in June and July, after increases of 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively, 
in April and May. 
</P>
<P>
The August figures left the pace of inflation during the past 12 months at an 
annual rate of 4.7%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Interpretations 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration touted the new figures as further evidence that its 
economic policies are working. The slowdown had been predicted by the 
President's Council of Economic Advisers, which had insisted that sharp 
increases posted earlier this year were transitory. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts outside the government were sharply divided Tuesday over whether 
the pause in August would prove fleeting. Some said that the recent declines in 
energy prices, along with slower food price increases, were masking a further 
speedup in the underlying inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
David D. Hale, economist for Kemper Financial Services Inc., in Chicago, 
forecast that the food and energy declines would come to an end soon and that 
August's consumer price index report may be "the last good CPI for the year." 
</P>
<P>
Joel A. Popkin, a Washington-based inflation watcher, said the past three 
months' good behavior on the price front is likely to prove nothing more than 
"a summer lull." He predicted that the overall inflation rate "will go back up 
to 5%" by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday that housing starts in the 
United States fell sharply in August to a new annual rate of 1.35 million 
units, down 5% from the previous month and the largest decline since a 12.7% 
plunge in February. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts blamed the fall on continuing high interest rates. Construction starts 
had fallen steadily for four straight months until rebounding in June -- the 
longest string of declines since early 1987. Apartment construction fell in 
August by 11.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, applications for new building permits, a harbinger of future trends in 
construction activity, rose 3.5% in August after falling in July. Analysts said 
construction patterns are likely to be erratic for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Unexpected 
</P>
<P>
In a calculation separate from the national inflation figures, the Labor 
Department reported that the consumer price index for the Los Angeles area fell 
0.1% in August, after a 0.2% rise the previous month. But the indexes kept for 
individual cities are erratic and are not adjusted for seasonal patterns. 
</P>
<P>
The August freeze in consumer prices nationwide had been widely expected. Jerry 
L. Jordan, economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, said the 
recent respite was "a mirror image" of the first half of 1989, when inflation 
was exacerbated by a series of special factors. 
</P>
<P>
He and other economists cited these developments: 
</P>
<P>
* Food prices, which rose sharply during the first half of the year after the 
drought in mid- and late 1988, slowed substantially in early summer and have 
risen only moderately since. They rose 0.2% in August, after a 0.3% increase in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
* Energy prices, particularly for gasoline, climbed steeply earlier in the year 
in the face of fears of shortages in the world oil market but have come down 
steadily -- and sharply -- in the second half. In August, they plunged nearly 
2%. 
</P>
<P>
* High inventories in the auto industry have led to significant discounting of 
car prices, particularly with the end of the model year this month. New car 
prices have edge downward for most of the summer. In August, they fell 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
* The steady rise in the value of the dollar has made imported goods less 
expensive for Americans, slowing that component of the consumer price index and 
keeping pressure on the rest of the economy as well. 
</P>
<P>
Most economists predict that inflation will receive another jolt this autumn, 
as the "summer lull" comes to an end. New 1990 model cars to be introduced in 
October are expected to be decidedly more expensive, and the dollar could 
decline anew. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to see a spike up beginning in October," said Edward Guay, 
economist for Cigna Corp. in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts differ sharply over what the inflation rate will be once that 
"spike" has ended. Guay, for one, said he believes that inflation is apt to 
slow again, if only because the Federal Reserve Board has been holding the 
economy in check. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that wage increases have remained relatively modest, despite the 
earlier speedups in food and energy prices. And he predicted that the gradual 
slowing of the economy will help push interest rates down further early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But Popkin predicted that inflation has already built up too much momentum to 
be cut without a serious recession. The fact that analysts are predicting a 
"soft landing," in which the economy will escape a recession, means that "the 
best we can do is flatten inflation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other important components of the consumer price index turned in a mixed 
performance during August. Medical costs jumped 0.7%, continuing the same 
frenetic pace at which they have risen for the bulk of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of apparel and household upkeep declined 1.5% in August, after steady 
decreases over the past three months. The Labor Department said end-of-season 
price reductions, particularly for women's and children's clothes, were larger 
than in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
And entertainment costs rose 0.3% for the month, halving the 0.6% pace at which 
they rose in June and July and reflecting a general slowdown in demand. 
</P>
<P>
The August report left the overall consumer price index at 124.6% of its 
1982-84 average -- meaning that it took $124.60 last month to buy the same 
goods and services that cost $100 in the early part of the decade.

CREDIT EASY BUT COSTLY IN INNER CITY; 
</P>
<P>
BUYERS TEND TO LOOK AT MONTHLY PAYMENTS, NOT HIGH RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Signs inside Cestra Furniture in South Central Los Angeles promise shoppers 
"90-day financing; no interest," but customers who take longer to settle their 
accounts could end up paying one of the highest finance rates in California -- 
a whopping 27% on items costing $1,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Inner city retailers, such as Cestra Furniture -- a small, nondescript store 
near 55th and Broadway -- say they must charge high rates to offer credit to 
people who, for the most part, do not have bank accounts or carry credit cards. 
They say the higher rates help cover losses that inevitably result from 
granting credit to consumers whom most lenders don't consider credit worthy. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the stiff terms don't deter many customers. Shoppers and store 
owners agree that for those buying items on time in the inner city, the size of 
the monthly payment, the selection of merchandise and special conveniences -- 
such as Spanish-speaking sales clerks -- are more important than the amount of 
the finance charge. 
</P>
<P>
"People will buy if they can get easy credit," Cestra owner Thomas Chavez said 
of his customers, most of whom, he says, are black or Latino and come from as 
far away as Downey, Inglewood and Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, while credit may be more freely available at some stores, interest rates 
have jumped dramatically from the 18% level California set before it lifted 
credit interest rate ceilings Jan. 1, consumers groups say. 
</P>
<P>
While interest rates at 12 major retailers -- including J. C. Penney, J. W. 
Robinson's, May Co. and Nordstrom -- rose just under 2 points to 19.8%, rates 
at some inner city stores jumped to as much as 27%, according to a study 
released last week by the California Public Interest Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
The California Retailers Assn. -- which lobbied for removing credit interest 
rate ceilings -- had predicted that "consumers could be expected to benefit 
from a free (credit) market." And in its own forthcoming study of 39 California 
retailers, the association reports that two-thirds of the retailers offered 
annual credit rates of 19.8% or less and that no rate higher than 24% was 
documented. 
</P>
<P>
But Henry Holmes, a consumer activist at CalPIRG, said a member of the group 
posing as a buyer was offered 27% by a finance company that Cestra sends credit 
applications to. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez of Cestra said he uses ITT Financial Services Co. of Los Angeles but 
added that he has nothing to do with the rates they set. "They take the 
application (from the customer) and send me a check for the balance due." 
</P>
<P>
Inquiries to ITT were referred to the regional manager, who did not return 
several phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Saravia, a 39-year-old maintenance man, is largely unconcerned with 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Monopolistic Pricing' 
</P>
<P>
He can't recall what rates he's been charged over the past six years, even 
though he has bought a stove, television, dining room table and a cabinet on 
time at Dearden's at 7th and Main. He said he patronizes Dearden's because he 
was unable to easily obtain credit at other stores he visited. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody (else) wanted a big deposit" on credit purchases, Saravia said. 
</P>
<P>
CalPIRG, however, contended in its report that the higher credit rates stemmed 
from "monopolistic pricing" of firms taking advantage of consumers with limited 
transportation to shop elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Although many customers who patronize inner city merchants are poor, with 
spotty employment records and little or no other access to credit, many 
disputed CalPIRG's presumption, saying they they often do have access to 
transportation and try to shop around. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Jones, a gas station attendant who lives on 54th Street near Cestra 
Furniture, said neither he nor anyone he knows of has ever patronized Cestra 
Furniture in the three years the store has been open. Jones said he has been in 
the store to look but added that the furniture, which ranges from $50 for a 
chair to $3,250 for a sofa set, is too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for a sofa one time but I can get a better deal at one of those 
Korean (-owned) furniture stores . . . on Crenshaw or at the swap meet," Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet consumers who are looking for "deals" may find it difficult to make fair 
interest rate and price comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue facing retailers is, do you make your money charging what the market 
will bear or do you cover the expense of granting credit by charging interest 
rates that reflect the risk of granting credit?" said Don Hoffman, general 
manager of Central Furniture, TV, Appliances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Lot of Cash Business 
</P>
<P>
Central chose to increase its interest rates somewhat. The store raised credit 
interest to a uniform 19.2% from a two-tiered level of 12% for outstanding 
balances above $1,000 and 18% for those below. "For the most part our consumer 
is a credit consumer. They shop here out of a basic need to buy merchandise on 
time; we don't have a lot of cash business," Hoffman noted. 
</P>
<P>
Valentino Lopez, a 24-year-old Los Angeles carwash attendant, is typical. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he's purchased a TV, a stove and several other items on credit 
at Central and remained a loyal customer despite the increase in credit 
interest. Last Saturday he bought a $350 "boom box" portable stereo and agreed 
to pay monthly installments of at least $40 with the outstanding balance 
financed at an interest rate of 19.57%. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said his main consideration in making his purchase was to keep his 
monthly payment below $100. "Credit is hard to get" at other places, he 
explained in Spanish. And salesmen at most large furniture retailers in the 
area don't speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Alfaro, a 33-year-old shipping clerk at Coast Magnetics, said he tried to 
obtain credit at a Los Angeles Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. store but could not 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
"I shop around but I always come here because of easy credit," Alfaro 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the convenience of Spanish-speaking sales clerks and easy credit, some 
merchants say there remains a psychological barrier of 20% credit interest that 
even unsophisticated consumers are still unwilling to breach. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally I don't want to see our interest rates go to 20 or above," said one 
Los Angeles merchant, who declined to be identified. "So when that (sales) 
contract prints out, I want that number to be 19.99%, 19.98%. I think there is 
a point at which that figure will become apparent to our consumer if they shop 
at another store. So I would like to see another store go over the 20% mark 
first."

MGM GRAND PLANS HOLLYWOOD THEME PARK IN LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the ink scarcely dry on Kirk Kerkorian's deal to sell his 82%-controlled 
MGM/UA Communications Co., the financier announced that his 98%-owned MGM Grand 
Inc. plans to build a movie theme park and new hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The news sent a ripple through Hollywood, because two larger entertainment 
companies -- Walt Disney Co. and MCA Inc. -- have committed over $1 billion to 
similarly themed attractions in central Florida, with talk of competing in 
Europe as well. 
</P>
<P>
To further complicate matters, the MGM name already appears on the Disney tour 
in Florida, under a 4-year-old agreement that was unsuccessfully challenged by 
MGM/UA last year in California state court. While that decision is on appeal, 
MGM Grand disclosed Tuesday that it has sued Disney in a Nevada state court to 
establish its right to use the MGM Grand name on theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
At least one analyst expressed skepticism that Kerkorian is firmly committed to 
the theme park undertaking. "Kirk's a very bright guy," the analyst said, 
speaking on the condition that he not be identified. "He does things like this 
constantly. He throws things out just to see what the reaction is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Desert Inn 
</P>
<P>
No immediate reaction could be registered on Wall Street, however, since the 
announcement was made after the close of the stock markets. MGM Grand, which is 
traded over the counter, ended the day at $17 a share, with no change in price. 
</P>
<P>
MGM Grand, organized three years ago, launched a posh airline offering service 
between New York and Los Angeles in 1987 and bought the Desert Inn the 
following year, along with adjacent undeveloped property in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The company announced Tuesday that it has agreed to pay $28 million for 143 
acres of land on the Desert Inn site, which it presently leases, to provide a 
possible site for the 4,000-room hotel and entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
MGM Grand has previously disclosed plans to raise about $120 million in a stock 
offering which would reduce Kerkorian's stake in the company to about 77%. The 
company intends to proceed with that offering once it clears the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, MGM Grand Chairman and Chief Executive Fred Benninger said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Benninger acknowledged that the company has not yet drawn up plans for its 
entertainment complex, and he said the company has not enlisted a partner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seems Like Lunacy' 
</P>
<P>
But a source at MCA said that company has engaged in preliminary discussions 
with Kerkorian about "possible participation" in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were divided about a movie tour's chances of success in 
gambling-oriented Las Vegas. "There's desert all around. There's no (large) 
population base. That seems like lunacy," one entertainment industry analyst 
declared privately. 
</P>
<P>
But Harold Vogel, Merrill Lynch's veteran analyst, said: "Vegas has been 
evolving to a more family-oriented business, and this, I think, is a natural 
extension of the destination resort concept. I think a lot of people bring 
their family and don't know what to do with their family while they go while 
they go gambling." 
</P>
<P>
(Vogel noted that Merrill Lynch has served as Kerkorian's adviser, so he 
declined to talk about MGM Grand's specific plan.) 
</P>
<P>
With Kerkorian's agreement last Friday to sell MGM/UA Communications to the 
Australian Qintex Group for $1.5 billion, the 72-year-old financier appeared 
ready to relinquish his 20-year-old hold on the beloved MGM name and logo. At 
the time, however, the buyer and seller agreed that MGM Grand would enjoy 
certain licensing rights to the MGM Grand name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Lawsuit Seen 
</P>
<P>
In its California lawsuit, MGM/UA argued that Disney had no right to use the 
name on its movie and television production facility in Florida, which opened 
months before the actual tour. MGM/UA also opposed the construction of hotels 
adjacent to the Disney tour, arguing -- again unsuccessfully -- that MGM Grand 
has exclusive rights to the MGM name on hotels. The decision has been appealed, 
said Skip Miller, the Los Angeles attorney who is handling both the California 
and Nevada cases for Kerkorian. 
</P>
<P>
No lawsuit over the theme park name is anticipated by Qintex, according to 
Kevin Wallace, Qintex America's chief financial officer. "We've worked out a 
special agreement (for) the use of the MGM Grand name and the stylized lion 
logo, which is a different lion (from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lion familiar to 
movie-goers) . . . for use in the theme parks and hotels," Wallace said.

JAMES FLANIGAN: JAPANESE PROFIT FROM MISTAKES OF U.S. BANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The investment by Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Japan's largest bank, in Manufacturers 
Hanover, the United States' seventh largest -- and Dai-Ichi's $1.3-billion 
purchase of a controlling interest in Manufacturers' CIT Finance subsidiary -- 
is the start of a major trend. 
</P>
<P>
Depend on it, more Japanese capital will be flowing into the U.S. finance 
industry -- not so much to buy U.S. lending institutions as to take markets and 
customers from them, because Japanese banks have plenty of money while U.S. 
banks have been weakened by a decade of bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
That contrast of capital strength and weakness is the key to understanding what 
lies ahead for U.S. banks -- and U.S. borrowers. For the banks it means merging 
with each other or forming alliances to strengthen their finances or to hold 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
For borrowers it means more money available in the marketplace -- "greater 
competition, and thus a lower cost to the consumer," says James McDermott, 
research chief of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., a New York firm 
specializing in bank securities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effort to Raise Equity 
</P>
<P>
Yet as the flow of Japanese money increases, you're sure to hear cries of alarm 
about Japan's hold on U.S. business and America's loss of financial leadership. 
But the fear and despair will be overstated, so perspective is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
To understand what is happening, think back to the time 10 years ago when money 
was flowing out of the oil-rich Middle East and being recycled in loans to 
Latin America and other poor nations. That's where the process began that led 
to Dai-Ichi's investment this week. 
</P>
<P>
The reason Manufacturers Hanover (nicknamed Manny Hanny) sold 60% of its 
profitable CIT subsidiary was that it had to raise money to boost reserves 
against its $6.8 billion in loans to Latin America. It also sold 5% of its 
stock to Dai-Ichi as part of an effort to raise equity and comply with 
tightened U.S. government rules on how much capital banks must hold. 
</P>
<P>
Manny Hanny is one of the weakest U.S. big banks, but by no means alone in 
having to boost reserves and raise capital. Banks everywhere, including Japan, 
made loans to Latin American governments and private companies. But U.S. banks 
led the way, because the U.S. government had the responsibility, as world 
leader, to recycle the petrodollars and keep the global economy going. One 
result has been billions in troubled loans on the books of U.S. banks: $8.85 
billion at Citicorp, $7.4 billion at BankAmerica, $6.4 billion at Chase 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Now more of those loans are being written off, which reduces the banks' capital 
and their capacity to lend. As a consequence, the next few years for U.S. banks 
will be a time of rebuilding -- a period, as baseball and football fans know, 
when the team is seldom strong enough to win a championship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$400 Billion in Assets 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Japanese banks, which lent mostly to Japan's growing industry in 
the last decade, are capital heavyweights. By one calculation, that of their 
value on the Tokyo stock market, the 13 largest banks in Japan are worth $500 
billion. By contrast, the market value of the 50 largest U.S. banks is less 
than $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The comparison is no exaggeration -- one leading U.S. banker puts the equity 
value of a single major Japanese bank at more than $350 billion. And you don't 
have to be an accountant to understand that banks that have a lot of money 
behind them have a competitive advantage over banks that do not. 
</P>
<P>
Which makes Dai-Ichi's purchase of CIT interesting, because the finance company 
is a lender to medium-sized companies. It has about $10 billion in loans 
outstanding to firms with sales of $250 million or so -- the profitable heart 
of U.S. business for a finance company. 
</P>
<P>
And Dai-Ichi -- a massive bank with $400 billion in assets (almost double 
Citicorp's size) -- has had its eye on that market. A few years ago, Dai-Ichi 
paid about $1 million to buy a U.S. operation that served medium-sized 
companies. "We wanted to learn the middle market," explained Koji Takahashi, a 
bank senior director, in a recent Tokyo interview. 
</P>
<P>
Having learned it, Dai-Ichi followed up this week with its $1.3-billion CIT 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
To U.S. bank competitors, Japanese ownership will matter. It's one reason 
you'll see many of the 1,400 U.S. banks merging to attain greater size. 
"They'll have to do something or see business go to the Japanese," notes 
analyst McDermott. 
</P>
<P>
But does it make a difference to borrowers that the lenders are foreign? Not 
really. The money market is now global; the more lenders vie for their 
business, the better it is for U.S. borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, says a leading U.S. financier, when U.S. banks had lots of money 
10 years ago they preferred to lend to foreign governments rather than U.S. 
companies. Now the banks are paying for that mistake, but the rest of U.S. 
business need not.

THATCHER TELLS JAPAN TO CUT TARIFF BARRIERS;

<P>
DESPITE GAINS, SHE SAYS THERE IS 'LONG WAY TO GO'

<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher started a visit to Japan on Tuesday by 
warning that Japan had "quite a long way to go" in lowering barriers to imports 
from the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, who relishes the role of drumbeater for British industry while on 
overseas trips, took up the cause of firms exporting to Japan during a visit to 
a major Tokyo bank. 
</P>
<P>
Inspecting the foreign exchange dealing room, which uses British 
high-technology systems, she declared: "This is the kind of export we wish to 
see more of. It is a very good example." 
</P>
<P>
Shown how to use a dealing station, Thatcher pressed a key and declared: "We 
just got through to London and bought sterling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$80-Billion Surplus 
</P>
<P>
Asked about recent Japanese moves to make foreign goods, including Scotch 
whiskey, more available, she said: "There's quite a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese government have taken down some tariff barriers. It's other kinds 
of barriers that are more difficult to get rid of." 
</P>
<P>
British officials said the type of barrier she was referring to included 
Japan's refusal to grant seats on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to two British 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's total trade surplus last year was about $80 billion. Britain's trade 
imbalance with Japan in 1988 was nearly $8 billion, and Thatcher has said she 
wants to see British goods as freely available in this country as Japanese 
videos and cameras are in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher will set out in detail her views on Japan's trade policies in a speech 
to economic organizations in Tokyo today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Environment on Agenda 
</P>
<P>
Before then, she will have sampled Japanese technology with a ride on a 
high-speed "bullet" train -- she takes pains to avoid traveling on trains in 
Britain -- and a tour of a computer microchip plant. 
</P>
<P>
She will also hold talks with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and discuss 
environmental issues with him during a televised broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before she left London, Thatcher told British television viewers that 
Kaifu would be the fourth Japanese premier with whom she had discussed trade 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
Environment was the first item on her agenda Tuesday when she visited Tokyo 
University to listen to three eminent scientists outline current threats to 
life on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
It will also be the main theme of her second speech in Tokyo, an address Friday 
to the biennial meeting of the International Democrat Union, which groups 
centrist and right wing political parties from 27 countries.

APPLE'S FIRST PORTABLE GETS POSH COMING-OUT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not to ruin your day, but Apple Computer Co. is tossing a lavish 
$1-million-plus party at the Universal Amphitheater this morning and chances 
are you aren't among the 5,000 computer salespeople, technology analysts and 
reporters who will be attending. 
</P>
<P>
But that's OK. If you really want to be a part of the festivities surrounding 
Apple's introduction of two personal computers -- including its first-ever 
portable Macintosh -- you can tune in to the satellite television broadcast. 
(Of course, you'll need one of those monstrous dish receivers, but odds are if 
you're that interested in all this, you've already got one.) 
</P>
<P>
The four-hour party marks the unveiling of the portable model that Apple 
executives have been promising for years, but have been unable to deliver until 
now, they say, because the technology for its state-of-the-art screen wasn't 
available and the company's engineers didn't want to settle for anything less. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a no-compromise machine," said a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Louis Gassee, president of the Apple Products division, called the machine 
"a Macintosh through and through." 
</P>
<P>
Now that it's here, many analysts say the machine -- particularly its bright, 
clear screen -- is just great. But they have three key problems with it: It's 
too big, too heavy and too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts have focused on the portable's price tag: about $8,000 when fully 
equipped with all the key options. By comparison, the top-of-the line 
Macintosh, the IIci model also being introduced today, will cost about $10,000 
when fully loaded. 
</P>
<P>
"One can only wonder how many people are willing to pay $8,000 for what 
essentially is a second computer," said David Cearley, an analyst with the 
Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Others have complained that the portable Macintosh really isn't portable. It 
weighs nearly 16 pounds when fully equipped and can fit on the lap of only a 
very large person. 
</P>
<P>
The portable's introduction comes at about the same time two other Silicon 
Valley computer companies, Poquet and Atari, have introduced portable models 
that weigh less than two pounds and fit in a coat pocket. The coincidence has 
not escaped notice. 
</P>
<P>
"There's certainly room for improvement with the portable Mac," Cearley said. 
"But it's clear to me that this is just their first entry." 
</P>
<P>
Added Richard Shaffer, editor of a personal computer newsletter in New York, 
"This machine would have been OK 12 months or 18 months ago. But not today." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, analysts agree that Apple should have no trouble selling the 
portables in their first year on the market. Cearley estimates first-year sales 
of 50,000 units, the equivalent of up to $400 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"There are enough people who really want this machine," said Jeffrey Tarter, 
editor of a PC software newsletter in Boston. "They've been waiting a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to the million-dollar party. 
</P>
<P>
Apple folks variously describe it as "glitzy," "a really big event" and "an 
extravaganza" designed to build market momentum and enthusiasm for the machine. 
</P>
<P>
Some party-goers are to arrive in Los Angeles from San Diego and Orange County 
via exclusively reserved Amtrak cars. They are then to be bused to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
The party is to open with a two-hour show featuring Apple chairman John 
Sculley, a laser light display, a computer animation show and a concert of 
specially commissioned music played on compact disks by several Macintoshes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of enthusiasm and passion for our products," says Christopher 
Escher, an original Apple employee who is handling the big show, "and we think 
it's important for people to celebrate our work."

First Executive Corp. Sued: Two shareholders filed suit against First Executive 
Corp. seeking to stop the Los Angeles-based insurance company's previously 
announced stock rights offering, contending that it is an anti-takeover device. 
Separately, ICH Corp., a Louisville, Ky.-based insurance holding company that 
may sell its 20% stake in First Executive, said it exchanged rights issued to 
it by First Executive for warrants to purchase additional common stock. ICH, 
barred from a hostile takeover of First Executive, is expected to sell the 
warrants, one analyst said.

FORD PLANS TO PURCHASE A 15% STAKE IN JAGUAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WARREN BROWN, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ford Motor Co., seeking to gain an advantage in the global luxury car wars, 
Tuesday announced plans to buy a 15% share of Jaguar PLC, one of Britain's 
premier auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts speculated that Ford is positioning itself to buy the entire 
company once the British government relinquishes its majority control, a move 
expected next year. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's minority interest in Jaguar would mark Ford's second stake in a 
prestigious British car company. It owns more than 50% of Britain's Aston 
Martin Lagonda Ltd., which produces the $142,000 Lagonda sedans and 
convertibles. Ford is also considering a buyout of the Saab car division of 
Sweden's Saab-Scania AB. 
</P>
<P>
The auto maker is hardly alone in its quest for prestige by acquisition. 
Chrysler Corp. in 1986 bought Italian auto maker Lamborghini, maker of cars 
starting at $145,000. Chrysler is also collaborating with Maserati of Italy in 
producing the $30,000 Chrysler TC two seater on sale in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
European Market Quest 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., the nation's biggest car company, bought all of Britain's 
Group Lotus in 1986. Lotus makes the Esprit Turbo, which starts at $70,645. 
</P>
<P>
The American car companies are going after the high-image European automobiles 
to boost their standing in the luxury car market at home and abroad, said 
Harvey E. Heinbach, an auto industry analyst with Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
"Ford has made it clear that it is interested in having a more upper-end car 
available for its European clients, where Ford does not have a full product 
line," Heinbach said. 
</P>
<P>
The "halo" or "rub-off" effect of owning prestigious European marques might 
also help U.S. car companies in the hotly contested luxury car market in their 
home country, Heinbach said. 
</P>
<P>
Luxury cars now constitute 10% of U.S. auto sales, two-thirds of which go to 
domestic manufacturers. But all of Japan's top auto makers are chasing luxury 
car dollars, which could erode the domestic makers' share. Jaguar has been 
losing money, largely because of a 5% decline in its U.S. sales, the company's 
second-largest market outside of Britain. Jaguar sells about 20,000 cars a year 
in the United States.

AFTER DELAYS, CAMPEAU HAS BAILOUT LOAN; 
</P>
<P>
REICHMANN BROTHERS GET CONTROL OF FIRM'S RETAILING UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than a week of tense negotiations, Campeau Corp. said Tuesday that 
it finally has secured a $250-million loan that will bail out its cash-starved 
U.S. retailing companies. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the infusion, the wealthy Reichmann brothers of Canada and 
their Olympia &amp; York Developments, as expected, gain control of the 
retailing units and will oversee Campeau's previously announced overhaul, 
including the sale of the glitzy Bloomingdale's chain. 
</P>
<P>
The Reichmanns supplant Robert Campeau, the bodacious Toronto entrepreneur 
whose hard-won acquisitions of Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores 
put his company deep in debt. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the company made much of the notion that its immediate liquidity 
crisis has passed, others said they would wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
Heller Financial Inc., a Chicago-based factoring firm that acts as a financial 
middleman between clothing makers and retailers, said it has not yet resumed 
shipments to the Federated and Allied chains. It halted shipments to the chains 
last week when Campeau's troubles were laid bare in financial filings with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Get New Chief 
</P>
<P>
The firm has advised manufacturing clients that future sales to Campeau's 
chains would be "at their sole credit risk" but that Heller would closely 
monitor any changes in Campeau's status. That situation still applies, 
spokesman John Brooklier said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
To restore Campeau Corp. to health, a four-member special directors committee 
was appointed to develop and implement plans. A new chief executive and a new 
chief financial officer will be named later, Campeau Corp. said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the changes were viewed as a setback to Robert Campeau, he sought in a 
prepared statement to put a good face on the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"At my request, Olympia &amp; York has agreed to substantially increase its 
investment in Campeau and to be primarily responsible for the refinancing and 
restructuring," Campeau said. "The significant experience and expertise of the 
Olympia &amp; York organization will greatly assist in the endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
Although Campeau retains his chairman's title, a new, pared-down board of 
directors eliminates many of his relatives and longtime associates. Among those 
are his wife, Ilse, and a son, Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
The board will now consist of 10 members, half its previous size. In addition 
to Campeau, 66, they include Ronald W. Tysoe, the 36-year-old president and 
chief operating officer of Campeau Corp., and Byron E. Allumbaugh, chairman of 
Ralphs Grocery in Compton, of which Campeau owns a majority of the stock. Three 
other directors, including Albert Reichmann, were named by Olympia &amp; York, 
and the remaining four are from outside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stymied by Creditors 
</P>
<P>
On the special restructuring committee will be Lionel G. Dodd, chief operating 
officer of Olympia &amp; York, who as chairman of the panel could break a tie 
with an extra vote; Robert J. Butler, retired president of the Eaton's 
department store chain of Toronto; G. William Miller, former U.S. Treasury 
secretary and now head of a merchant banking firm in Washington, and Tysoe. 
</P>
<P>
For days, Campeau Corp. had indicated that it hoped at any time to announce the 
loan arrangement, but observers said the company was repeatedly stymied by 
demands from cautious lenders who wanted to protect themselves. The agreement 
was not fully cleared until 6:30 California time Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the loan agreement was announced, Allied Stores received $50 million 
and immediately covered an interest payment that it had been unable to make 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Olympia &amp; York will receive warrants entitling it to buy 
Campeau shares. If it buys all 16 million additional shares, its stake in 
Campeau would rise to about 38.4% from the 24.5% held now. Meanwhile, Robert 
Campeau's stake would drop to 43.2% from about 54%. 
</P>
<P>
The imminent settling of the cash crisis was cause for celebration for at least 
one interested party Monday night. Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin S. Traub, who 
has said he would like to buy the 17-store chain, and a 15-person entourage 
popped open champagne bottles at Bouley, a restaurant in downtown Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
CAMPEAU'S U.S. HOLDINGS

FUND THAT INSURES BANKS IS HEALTHY, U.S. OFFICIALS ASSURE

The federal fund that insures commercial bank deposits is not in any danger of 
collapsing as the savings and loan insurance fund did, government banking 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But two private analysts said more than two dozen banks were operating with 
liabilities greater than their assets and should be closed. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators, testifying before the House banking subcommittee on financial 
institutions, rejected that assertion and said their policy is to close 
insolvent banks. 
</P>
<P>
"The bank insurance fund is solvent and can meet the obligations as we foresee 
them today," Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
Congress adopted legislation in August to bail out the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corp., which will cost taxpayers more than $200 billion over 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman testified that the FDIC fund had a net worth of $14.1 billion after 
losses of $6.3 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
While economic conditions could change, he and the other officials said they 
were cautiously optimistic about the outlook for banks. 
</P>
<P>
But a proposal by Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke was criticized by 
members of the panel who said it would weaken capital rules for banks and 
endanger the fund. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke has proposed that in addition to new international risk-based capital 
rules, U.S. banks have minimum capital of 3% of their liabilities.

SENATE HIKES FHA LOAN CAP IN HIGH-COST AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Senate on Tuesday approved an increase in the FHA loan ceiling for 
high-cost areas from $101,250 to $125,000 in a compromise move to provide some 
help to home buyers in such places as Southern California and metropolitan New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to objections by the Bush Administration and lawmakers from rural 
states, however, the Senate refused to eliminate the ceiling and to base 
Federal Housing Administration lending limits on median statewide or areawide 
housing costs. That proposal, from the Appropriations Committee, would have 
allowed the FHA to make loans up to $153,900 in California and up to $189,000 
in the New York region. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Don Nickles (D-Okla.) argued successfully that a ceiling based on housing 
costs could raise the FHA's liability and expose the government agency to 
increased defaults. The Senate rejected his proposal for a $118,000 ceiling for 
high-cost areas but when he tried again with a cap of $125,000, it sailed 
through on a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
Under present law, FHA loans for residential housing are limited to 95% of the 
median price in an area, subject to an overall national ceiling of $67,500 
except for high-cost areas. In those areas there is the special ceiling of 
$101,250. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) argued that real estate prices in California are 
so high -- with a median cost of $153,900 for a single-family home -- that the 
FHA has been "simply knocked out of the market." 
</P>
<P>
The 5% down payment allowed by FHA, he said, is a strong incentive for 
first-time home buyers who may have good incomes but lack the funds to put down 
the higher amounts required with a conventional mortgage loan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Help the Rich' 
</P>
<P>
"The FHA will be stronger under this proposal because of better credit risks it 
will be insuring," Cranston argued. 
</P>
<P>
Nickles, however, said that the FHA is already losing money -- $500 million in 
1988 -- and that it cannot afford to take even greater risks. Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) sided with Nickles, contending that FHA loan defaults 
are at the $2-billion level already. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the higher FHA ceilings, Dole said, are "reaching out to help the 
rich" buy expensive homes. 
</P>
<P>
The measure approved Tuesday is part of a $67.2-billion measure pending before 
the Senate that will finance federal housing, veterans, space and environmental 
programs for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. If the bill passes, it would be 
considered by a Senate-House conference committee.

AIRBUS TO DECIDE FRIDAY ON NEW AIRPLANE PROJECT

<P>
Western Europe's Airbus Industrie will decide Friday whether to go ahead with 
its new A321 plane, even though the consortium's four partners cannot agree on 
where to build it. 
</P>
<P>
The new aircraft -- a stretched version of the successful high-technology A320 
-- has already won 87 orders and 66 options before the program's official 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
An Airbus spokeswoman said the new aircraft would be discussed at Friday's 
meeting of the five-member supervisory board. In June, Airbus Chairman Jean 
Pierson said the new plane would have to have at least 40 firm orders before 
the program could go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
France's Aerospatiale and Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm of West Germany each have 
a 38% stake in Airbus. British Aerospace has 20%, and Spain's CASA has 4%. 
</P>
<P>
The company has enjoyed considerable success since it was established in the 
early 1970s and is now a serious rival to U.S. manufacturers McDonnell Douglas 
and Boeing, taking about 30% of civilian airliner orders in the non-communist 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The current row between France and West Germany over the location of a future 
plant is a product of that very success. 
</P>
<P>
At present, all Airbus planes are assembled in the southwestern French city of 
Toulouse from components built in the four partners' countries. 
</P>
<P>
France and West Germany have commissioned an independent report on the dispute.

'ALPHABET OF BONES' GIVES NEW MEANING TO MOVEMENT 
</P>

<P>
To Joyce Cutler-Shaw, the art of communication is as easy as ABC. What sets the 
San Diego-based visual artist apart from the pack is her own alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
"I developed an alphabet of bones," she said in an interview from her home last 
week. "It's an original calligraphy with 26 characters, each with an alphabetic 
equivalent in the English language. But it's really a visual dance with an 
embedded symbolic code. When I was developing the calligraphy of bone, I was 
interested in the relationship between dance and movement." 
</P>
<P>
That fascination led her to seek out kindred spirits -- San Francisco-based 
dancer/choreographer Nancy Karp and local composer Chaya Czernowin. 
</P>
<P>
Their three-way collaboration produced "From the Alphabet of Bones," a 
full-length work that translates Cutler-Shaw's original calligraphy into 
movement and voice. The interdisciplinary performance piece will premiere at 8 
p.m. Thursday through Sunday at Sushi's downtown gallery space. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're all really doing is developing parallel languages," said 
Cutler-Shaw, whose haunting representational drawings of the skeletal forms of 
birds were the catalyst for this ambitious undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
"I was interested in the possibilities of parallel languages when I developed 
my calligraphy of bone," she said. "Nancy (Karp) had done a book of graphic 
notation, and I saw certain parallels in her work. 
</P>
<P>
"I had (written) a text and translated it into bone. Then Nancy developed a 
vocabulary of 26 movements for a visual alphabet, and responded in dance terms 
to the text. Chaya interpreted vocal equivalents to the alphabet of bones." 
</P>
<P>
"I composed the music only from seeing the text in bone," Czernowin said during 
a break from rehearsals. "I was not interested in the meaning -- only the 
graphics. I gave every letter a sonic gesture that I could interpret in many 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
As Karp explained in a telephone interview from the San Francisco Bay Area last 
weekend: "I found myself fascinated with the structure. In the alphabet of 
bones calligraphy, each character is part of a configuration of figures. It's a 
wonderful device. I came up with more than 26 different movement phrases, and 
then we chose the ones that worked for the piece." 
</P>
<P>
Karp created more than 26 distinct phrases for the duet section of the dance, 
performed by longtime Karp company dancers Deirdre Carrigan and Diane McKallip. 
</P>
<P>
"If each dancer used the same phrases for every letter, they'd be doing unison 
dancing all the time," Karp said. "So we had to make sure that one dancer's A 
was not the same as the other's. Sometimes they come together, but it's a very 
elaborate system, because there are so many variations." 
</P>
<P>
The performance piece was designed to be sequential in structure, rather than a 
continuum of simultaneous stimuli, according to Cutler-Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
"It weaves through a sequence of presentations," she said. "When the dance 
portion is over, I come in and take over with the speaking part of the text. 
And when I finish, Chaya sings the text." 
</P>
<P>
Connecting all the elements -- dance, story and sonic gestures -- are 
Cutler-Shaw's graceful graphic images. 
</P>
<P>
"Joyce made beautiful characters," said Karp, "and the calligraphy will be 
projected to create the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the lighting designer (Craig Wolf of San Diego State University) 
asked us to wear light-colored costumes to heighten the effect when the dancers 
pass through the light projections," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Into Flight" -- the section Cutler-Shaw recites and Czernowin sings in "From 
the Alphabet of Bones" -- has a serious message as its subtext. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with issues of survival and evolution -- from the reptile to the 
bird to human and perhaps into the humane," Cutler-Shaw said. The bird imagery 
"is a symbol and a metaphor for environmental concerns. It's about 
transformation. We have to be much more responsible. We have to change our 
habits. And artists are mediums for that kind of thing -- the conveyance of 
illumination." 
</P>
<P>
Separated as they were by distance, collaborating on this "visual dance" was a 
challenge for Cutler-Shaw, Karp and Czernowin. But with help from a California 
Arts Council grant, and plenty of stubborn determination, their vision has 
reached fruition. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult, with me in San Francisco and the others in San Diego," Karp 
said. "I've been down to San Diego to meet with Joyce and examine the space, 
and Joyce has taken several trips here -- and we've been on the phone a lot. 
But it's been very interesting. Joyce and I have a different way of looking at 
the aesthetics, but it's been a real pleasure juxtaposing movement in a 
different way." 
</P>
<P>
"The most exciting new works are those that break down boundaries between the 
arts," said Cutler-Shaw. "We all have individual voices, but working together 
makes our own voice that much more distinct."

RAPPERS TO GET ANOTHER CHANCE DESPITE RUCKUS

Despite a violent flare-up between security guards and gang members at a July 
30 rap concert at the San Diego Sports Arena, Phil Quinn, the arena's executive 
vice president and general manager, is giving local rap fans a second shot. 
</P>
<P>
He has just OKd another rap concert for the arena, scheduled for Oct. 14 and 
headlined by M. C. Hammer, whose "They Put Me in the Mix" is rapidly climbing 
Billboard's Hot Rap Singles chart. 
</P>
<P>
"The promoter assured me it's a very mild show compared to the Nitro Tour," 
Quinn said, referring to the traveling troupe of five rappers -- including L.L. 
Cool J and De La Soul -- whose appearance at the arena two months ago was 
anything but mild. Toward the end of that show, members of two rival gangs 
circling the interior concourse turned on the 30-member arena security force 
assigned to watch them. In the ensuing melee, three security guards were 
injured, two suffering black eyes and the third, a broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the promoter's assurances, Quinn added, he's not taking any chances. 
"We're going to be extra careful this time around," he said. "We're monitoring 
the (M. C. Hammer) tour before it comes to San Diego, and we plan on talking to 
building operators in other cities to see what problems, if any, they 
encounter. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we're going to act accordingly in regard to security, metal detectors, 
and all the other precautions we might have to take. 
</P>
<P>
"We're determined to avoid a repeat of what happened last time." 
</P>
<P>
It's real tough for San Diego pop bands who play original music to get exposure 
in San Diego. They have trouble landing bookings at local nightclubs because 
they don't play the Top 40, and they have trouble getting airplay on local 
radio stations because they aren't signed to major labels -- and they don't 
have any hits. 
</P>
<P>
Marco Collins sympathizes with their plight. And as host of "Loudspeaker," a 
new weekly, hour-long program on progressive rock station XTRA-FM (91X) devoted 
exclusively to home-grown talent, he's in a position to help. Every Sunday, 
starting at midnight, the 24-year-old deejay gives his listeners a taste of 
what the San Diego music scene has to offer. On most episodes of "Loudspeaker," 
he spotlights one particular band -- playing four or five of their songs in a 
row and then following up with either a prerecorded interview or an in-studio 
appearance. Visiting band members field questions from callers, discuss their 
careers, and sometimes even perform an additional song or two live. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the show is important because it gives local bands a venue to expose 
themselves to listeners who otherwise would never have the chance to hear 
them," Collins said. "There's so much great talent in this town that no one 
really knows about, and I'm hoping to change that." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter whether a band has a record out or has just cut its first 
demonstration tape, Collins added. Everyone's welcome, he said, as long as 
they're local, as long as they play original music -- and as long as they're 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing everything from real high-tech dance stuff, like Red Flag's new 
(Enigma) album and a demo tape by Impact, to grungy garage stuff by bands like 
the Warlocks, who have just put out a single on a small independent New York 
label," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the bands I'll play are currently unsigned, and that's really what 
this show is all about -- exposing local music that isn't getting exposed 
anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Submissions can be sent to Marco Collins at 91X, 4891 Pacific Highway, San 
Diego 92110. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Now that the Rolling Stones have added a third show at the Los 
Angeles Coliseum, it's almost certain that the "World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll 
Band" won't be rolling into San Diego next month after all. San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium officials had been hoping for an Oct. 18 booking, but with the 
Stones playing the Coliseum the next night -- and not just on Oct. 21 and 22, 
as previously announced -- little hope remains. "I think it's a matter of 
dollars and cents to them," said stadium business manager Steve Schushan. "We 
could only offer them one date in that time frame, and apparently it wasn't 
cost-effective for them to come down here and set up their stage for just one 
show -- whereas in L.A., they already had two shows and their stage was already 
set up." Stadium manager Bill Wilson, however, insists that "even with a third 
L.A. date, they still might come down here," although he concedes "that's 
probably not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
MCA Records has just released the eponymous debut album by San Diego rock band 
the Voices. Four of the group's five members are graduates of La Jolla High 
School. The LP was produced by Andy Slater, producer of the last two Warren 
Zevon albums, and engineered by Niko Bolas, whose credits include Melissa 
Etheridge and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. . . . Meanwhile, "Poor and 
Famous," the fourth album by local roots rockers the Beat Farmers, continues to 
pick up airplay on album-rock radio stations throughout the country and is 
reportedly about to crack Billboard's Top Pop Albums chart. The LP came out in 
July, also on the MCA label. The Beat Farmers, incidentally, will be appearing 
Thursday night at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: John Lee Hooker and the Coast to Coast 
Blues Band, tonight at the Belly Up Tavern; the Dave Brubeck Quartet, Thursday 
at Humphrey's on Shelter Island; the Outlaws, Saturday at the Bacchanal in 
Kearny Mesa; and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, also Saturday, at Iguanas in 
Tijuana.

King World Productions, which distributes "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!," 
is venturing beyond its normal syndication base with its first 
advertiser-supported network TV project, "Christmas in America: A Love Story." 
Kenny Rogers will star in the drama that will air on NBC and be sponsored by K 
mart. The special, inspired by last year's best-selling photo anthology, finds 
Rogers as a globe-trotting photographer who looks back on his life. Rogers 
himself is an amateur photographer. King World and K mart also are tied to 
another holiday special featuring Martha Stewart, author-lecturer and K mart 
spokeswoman, scheduled to air in November and December on Lifetime cable.

Nancy McKeon doesn't want to work in "Working Girl." The former "Facts of Life" 
star has bowed out of the title role in NBC's midseason "Working Girl" series 
based on the movie that won Melanie Griffith an Academy Award nomination. 
McKeon left for "personal reasons," though she remains under exclusive contract 
to Twentieth Television Corp. to develop and star in a TV series. Search for a 
replacement is under way, and the studio hopes to begin filming next month as 
planned. Meanwhile, McKeon will be seen in the TV movie "A Cry for Help: The 
Tracey Thurman Story," Oct. 2 on NBC. ALEENE MacMINN

JAZZ NOTES : TALBERT IN BENEFIT FOR VISITING NURSES ASSN.; RECORDING ARTS' 
ROAST AT SPORTSMEN'S LODGE 
</P>

In what could easily be described as the best kind of home cooking, 
composer-arranger Tom Talbert leads his septet in the living room of his Laguna 
Beach home this Sunday in a benefit for the Visiting Nurses Assn. of Orange 
County Hospice. 
</P>
<P>
The 4 p.m. performance -- dubbed Jazz in the Afternoon -- marks the fourth time 
in as many years that Talbert has opened up his doors for the association, a 
volunteer organization that provides emotional support and periodic respite to 
the terminally ill and their families. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of a more worthwhile charity," said Talbert, who'll play pieces 
from his "Louisiana Suite" (Sea Breeze) LP. "VNA has a tough time because 
people don't want to talk about dying, so the organization doesn't get a lot of 
exposure." 
</P>
<P>
"Tom supports us tremendously," said Linda Conway, VNA's volunteer coordinator. 
"Last year we had 155 people attend." 
</P>
<P>
"I have a big house," Talbert said. "It has good acoustics and we get such a 
good audience. They're very attentive and involved and that affects the group. 
It's always been very good musically and a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
The benefit, for which a donation of $40 is requested, kicks off the 
association's annual "Light Up a Life" fund-raiser, where the public "can honor 
loved ones, both those living and those in memory, by placing a light on our 
35-foot tree, which is lighted outside our office in the City of Orange 
throughout December," said Conway. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (714) 771-1209. 
</P>
<P>
Such dubious honors as "best phone hog," "best studio tan" and "most impressive 
warm-up (instrumental)" will be awarded Sunday at the Sportsmen's Lodge in 
North Hollywood, 1 p.m., when the L.A. Chapter of the National Academy of 
Recording Arts and Sciences presents the first "Yo Cat" roast. 
</P>
<P>
The program -- emceed by the Don Rickles of jazz, trumpeter-comedian Jack 
Sheldon -- will both salute and ridicule musicians who make their living 
primarily in the town's recording studios. Tom Scott, musical director of "The 
Pat Sajak Show," will be the roastee-of-honor, and musical interludes will be 
provided by singer-comedienne Marie Cain, among others. 
</P>
<P>
"Yo Cat" admission is $15 for academy members, $20 for non-members. 
Information: (818) 843-8253. 
</P>
<P>
To support the International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation's "Jazz Goes to School" 
program, bassist Leslie Baker and tenorman Ricky Woodard will lead quartets at 
5 p.m. this Sunday and next at Webster's Restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. 
Cover charge is $8 for non-members, $5 for members, with musicians admitted 
free. "Jazz Goes to School" will again offer performances by local jazz 
musicians in Los Angeles elementary and junior high schools in January. 
Information: (213) 469-5589. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago Sunday it was Bob Cooper Day here in Los Angeles. Two days before 
that, the mellow-toned saxophonist's trumpet-playing buddy, Snooky Young, was 
similarly feted by his hometown of Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said the longtime member of "The Tonight Show" orchestra, "they gave me 
a key to the city and a proclamation from the mayor, and then Bob (Cooper), 
(pianist) Ross (Tompkins) and (singer) Ernie Andrews and I, plus a couple of 
local musicians, gave a concert at the Dayton Art Institute. It turned out 
great, with a full house and people really responding." 
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old Young, whose most recent release -- "In a Mellotone" 
(Fantasy/Galaxy) -- is co-led with Cooper and features Andrews, takes off this 
weekend to play a jazz party in Aspen, Colo.

A House panel voted in Washington to designate another 378,000 acres of 
California's Los Padres National Forest as wilderness, which would roughly 
double the amount of land in the forest to be preserved in its natural state. 
The voice vote by the Interior subcommittee on parks and public lands would 
also protect portions of three rivers -- the Sespe, Sisquoc and Big Sur -- from 
construction of dams or other permanent structures.

A self-described free-lance hit man says in Playboy magazine that former 
Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa was shot and dismembered and buried near the end 
zone in Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. In an interview in the November 
issue of Playboy, Donald (Tony the Greek) Frankos, who is now in the federal 
government's witness protection program, claims he told the FBI in 1986 that 
Hoffa was killed by alleged Irish mob boss Jimmy Coonan in a house near the 
Detroit suburb of Mt. Clemens. Hoffa's body was dismembered with a chain saw 
and stored in a freezer for five months before it was transported to New 
Jersey, the magazine reported. FBI officials declined comment on Frankos' 
account of Hoffa's disappearance July 30, 1975.

COLOMBIA SEEKS 2 ISRAELIS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Colombia has issued arrest warrants for two Israelis accused of training hit 
squads for the drug cartels waging war on the government, an official said. 
Acting on a request by the Department of Administrative Security, Colombia's 
equivalent of the FBI, a judge issued the warrants for a former Israeli army 
colonel, Yair Klein, and businessman Arik Acek. "They are wanted for violating 
laws against conspiring, teaching and enlisting civilians in military 
operations without the approval of the Defense Ministry," a department 
spokeswoman said. Klein, now home in Tel Aviv, has said he trained Colombian 
farmers to protect themselves against leftist guerrillas. Israel does not have 
an extradition treaty with Colombia.

The national AIDS commission, concerned that President Bush's anti-drug 
strategy makes too little mention of AIDS, agreed to draft a statement calling 
for treatment of drug addicts in preventing the spread of AIDS. The statement 
will reaffirm a call by the previous AIDS commission formed by President Ronald 
Reagan for drug treatment on demand as a national goal, said Dr. June Osborn, 
chairwoman of the new panel. The AIDS virus can be spread through sharing of 
needles by drug users. The new AIDS panel, created by Congress last year but 
not fully constituted until this summer, will not recommend a specific amount 
of funds for drug treatment, Osborn, dean of the University of Michigan's 
School of Public Health, said.

MOST IN SURVEY CRITICAL OF TV EVANGELISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new Gallup Poll found that public opinion of television evangelists in 
general is at an all-time low. In 1980, when Gallup first started gauging the 
public's image of television evangelists, most Americans held positive views of 
them as a group. Now, nearly eight in 10 (79%) say television evangelists 
cannot be trusted with their supporters' donations. In 1980, less than half as 
many (36%) were distrustful of evangelists' handling of funds. Large majorities 
now describe TV evangelists as dishonest (70%), insincere (67%), lacking a 
special relationship with God (67%), and uncaring (62%). The results are based 
on telephone interviews with 1,238 randomly selected adults conducted from 
Sept. 7-10. The error rate could be plus or minus 4 percentage points.

Federal officials were investigating the crash near Escondido of a 
single-engine plane that may have come apart in flight, killing the pilot and 
his passenger, authorities said. Names of the victims were being withheld 
pending notification of relatives and the conclusion of a search through rugged 
terrain east of Interstate 15, where the aircraft came down, San Diego County 
sheriff's deputies said. Two men boarded the Beechcraft Bonanza at Brown Field 
near San Diego on a flight to Chino Airport in Riverside County, the Federal 
Aviation Administration said. The pilot did not file a flight plan and none was 
required, the agency added. Witnesses said pieces of the plane were flying off 
it as it plunged into a ravine about a mile north of the Deer Springs Road 
freeway off-ramp.

Amnesty International condemned the continued use of the death penalty. It said 
it documented 1,600 judicial executions worldwide in the first eight months of 
1989 but added that the "true number of people executed was much higher" 
because some nations do not disclose figures. The London-based human rights 
organization said it sent special appeals to the governments of the United 
States, the Soviet Union, South Africa, Iran, Iraq and China. It said a U.S. 
Supreme Court ruling in June upholding the death sentence for convicted 
juveniles and mentally retarded people "is a retrograde step which flies in the 
face of international human rights treaties and standards."

A Bayonne, N.J., bulk chemical storage facility operator was ordered to pay a 
fine of more than $3 million for continued dumping of oil-fouled waste water 
into New York Harbor, a penalty described as the highest ever levied in a 
private suit under the Clean Water Act. U.S. District Judge Nicholas Politan 
blamed "lethargic enforcement" of environmental regulations by the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency and the New Jersey Department of Environmental 
Protection for allowing Powell Duffryn Terminals Inc. to pollute the Kill Van 
Kull for 11 years. Politan's ruling arose from a suit by the Public Interest 
Research Group and Friends of the Earth.

BOXER TRIES TO COPE WITH SHADOWS ON CAREER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone in this town should know better than to bet on a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the sure thing: a great young boxer, one of three U.S. gold medalists at 
the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Discharged from the Army and marries his sweetheart. 
Wins, easily, his first four pro bouts. Considered the best pro prospect from 
the class of 1988. At 23, no history of any problems with drugs or the law. 
</P>
<P>
So, do you bet on Kennedy McKinney or do you pass? Is he too good to be true or 
is he the real thing? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the bizarre story of McKinney's life since winning the gold 
medal, the improbable last 12 months, is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
When the boxer tells of a gradual slide into drinking and eventual cocaine use, 
it is as familiar as today's news. When he says he disappeared for three days 
to take care of some personal business, it's not surprising. When he tells of 
his arrest for something he didn't do, we nod knowingly. Of course. 
</P>
<P>
So far have athletes fallen in our moral expectations these days that little 
they may do is shocking. Promising athletes fall off the end of the earth with 
such frequency that no one seems to miss them anymore. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the story of Kennedy McKinney is trite. He is a living cliche. All 
that is left is for him to announce soon that he has blown all his money, 
pawned his gold medal and will soon be checking into a convenient alley. 
</P>
<P>
To listen and believe McKinney's story and its well-marked trail of coincidence 
requires a leap of faith. Or at least a suspension of the cynicism that is easy 
to assume. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he says he is one fighter who desperately does not want his life to be a 
cliche. He apparently has a fight on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"Over in Korea, I put it in my mind: There was only one way I could come back 
successful, and that was to win a gold medal. The training and dedication I put 
into that was really unbelievable. Staying away from the partying and the 
drinking. Going to bed on time, getting up on time. Eating the right thing. So, 
there was no way I could lose, no way. I could have beat the world at that 
point in time -- which I did." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney was sitting in his attorney's office this week, trying to come up with 
some coherence for his falling into cliche No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Working so hard to get the gold medal, and being so determined . . . when I 
got back it was party time. That's basically what it came down to. I just 
partied a little too much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't much of a party type until then. When I came back, it was just time 
to party with the guys. Either they had tried out for the (Olympics) or they 
had seen me on TV. It was there waiting on me, I guess. It was beer drinking 
and going out to the clubs. Going out and having fun with your friends until 3 
or 4. At that time I didn't have to be in (at a certain time. But) I had to be 
in because I had a fiancee and I couldn't neglect her." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney's life moved willy-nilly. He married and signed a pro contract two 
months after returning to Killeen, Tex., where he had trained as a bantamweight 
for the Army boxing team stationed at Ft. Hood. McKinney signed with manager 
Fred Glusman for a $65,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
He moved here in January. 
</P>
<P>
"The party just kept going," he said. "I was enjoying it. I felt I owed it to 
myself. It did get out of hand. It started in Texas, I guess you could say I 
brought it here. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we started getting into the gym, it didn't come to a screeching halt. It 
slowed up a lot. It was like we ran into a school zone. That came from me. I 
knew that my professional debut was coming up now, I wanted to look good." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney had his pro debut Feb. 24 on the undercard of the Iran Barkley-Roberto 
Duran fight in Atlantic City, N.J. He scored a second-round knockout. 
</P>
<P>
And in his second fight, McKinney had an even easier time. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I figured, 'Hey, this is the same stuff, it's easy,' " McKinney 
said. "That was a problem. Then I got back into partying." 
</P>
<P>
By his third fight, McKinney was losing interest. The fight went six rounds and 
his work was uninspired. He won his fourth fight, on the undercard of the 
Thomas Hearns-Sugar Ray Leonard fight June 12. It was the worst kind of win, 
for it did untold damage to McKinney. It drove him deeper into drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Cliche No. 2 is cocaine. McKinney was a user. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't pinpoint it. It just happened," he said. "A mistake. I was never a 
heavy user. It was something that I did on occasions. I told my wife (Inga) 
about it. She suggested I tell Freddy, my manager, about it. I did. I went and 
got help. That's it. It was a problem that needed to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney had by then failed two drug tests. He checked into a rehabilitation 
center for 28 days in July. When he emerged, he said, drugs were out of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was doing this for no one else," he said. "I was doing it for Kennedy 
McKinney. So it didn't matter what I had to do. I wanted to correct that 
problem. I went to them. They didn't have to find this out. I went and did it 
because I wanted to do it." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney had three weeks to train for his fifth pro fight, set for Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
By his own admission, he was too eager to show everyone that his drug problem 
was over. The fight was the means to that end. 
</P>
<P>
"I rushed myself a little too much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fight ended in a technical draw after 1 1/2 rounds, both fighters being 
called for unintentional head butts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my very first draw," McKinney said. "It was hard to deal with. I 
swallowed that with a big lump. It hurt. I can't believe that was on my record. 
I guess it got me down a little bit. That was a period of an emotional letdown. 
That draw took so much out of me. It took a lot out of my training. It had a 
bad effect on me." 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had McKinney collected his paycheck for the fight than he got in 
trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
Cliche No. 3 was going AWOL from training. 
</P>
<P>
Early in September, two weeks ago, McKinney left town without telling anyone. 
He missed three consecutive days of training. His wife called the police and 
filed a missing-persons report. 
</P>
<P>
Then McKinney returned, as suddenly as he had left. Where had he been, what had 
he done and with whom? McKinney refuses to say. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something that I had to do personally," he said. "If I had told (his 
manager and trainer), they wouldn't have understood, from the beginning. If I 
would have said, 'I have to do this, I have to have three days off,' they 
wouldn't have agreed to that. I had to do it. There was no way I could have 
gotten around it. It was a very personal problem of mine. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife didn't know I was there for three days. She still don't know what I 
had to do. Like I say, I still can't even tell her. I just want to make this 
clear, it didn't have nothing to do with drugs at all." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone had presumed that Kennedy was on a bender somewhere, snorting away his 
career. McKinney knew enough to anticipate the reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure they thought it was drugs. That's exactly what they thought," he said. 
"They didn't even give me the benefit of the doubt, to say, 'Well, McKinney, we 
are going to give you a urinalysis test. If you come up positive, you are 
finished.' They told me I wasn't welcome in the gym. I thought it would work 
itself out." 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Cliche No. 4 was the arrest on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney was driving with Howard Hilliard and Nathaniel Smith that Tuesday 
afternoon, looking for a man they knew as Nay Nay. This man had allegedly taken 
$500 from Smith's hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw a female standing on the corner with a blue outfit. She looked like Nay 
Nay's girlfriend," McKinney said. "We pulled up across the street and said, 
'Have you seen Nay Nay?' The young lady just broke off and ran. 
</P>
<P>
"Automatically, we thought she knew where he was. She ran to a motel. I did a 
U-turn and pulled into the motel. Howard got out of the car and went down to 
the room and looked in. When he didn't see Nay Nay, he said, 'I'm sorry.' By 
this time the motel manager came out. We tried to explain the story to him as 
best we could. Then we kept driving, looking for the guy." 
</P>
<P>
The motel manager called Las Vegas police and an hour later McKinney's car was 
stopped. McKinney says they had no idea what the police wanted. When they were 
told they were under arrest for kidnaping, they said in unison, "Kidnaping 
who?" 
</P>
<P>
"If I had tried to kidnap the young lady, I'm not dumb enough to keep driving 
around in the same neighborhood, knowing the manager had got my license plate 
number," McKinney said. "I'm not that dense." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney spent four days and three nights in jail before being released last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against McKinney and Smith have since been dropped by the district 
attorney, who cited insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the story of McKinney's arrest was flashing across the nation. The 
next day, the story of his drug rehabilitation broke and his mysterious 
disappearance was reported. 
</P>
<P>
"They had the paper in jail, they had the TVs on," McKinney said. "The other 
guys knew who I was. They asked me, 'Man, were you in the Olympics?' I said, 
'No, that was my brother.'

"I was very embarrassed. When I found out that it was in the paper and on the 
TV and everybody heard about it, I just hung my head." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney has shielded his wife from reporters. He feels his actions have 
already embarrassed her enough. McKinney was especially upset that the drug 
rehab story had leaked. It colored everything else. 
</P>
<P>
"That's exactly what came to their mind, drugs," he said. "I was condemned 
right there. People will label me as that for a while. But I can fight through 
that. I've fought through a lot of things. It won't be easily washed away, but 
in time it will be washed away." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney's attorney, Dominic Gentile, is angry that the drug rehab story has 
been linked to McKinney's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way," he said. "It's a cliche, I'll give it to you, but there's no 
way it holds any substance. Nobody would have cared that the guy got arrested 
and the charges were dropped. Nobody. They bring up this drug stuff and right 
away, 'Oh, he must have been broke. He's burned up all his money. The fame went 
to his head.' And none of it's true. There's nothing there." 
</P>
<P>
Cliche No. 5 is trouble with a fighter's management. 
</P>
<P>
It has variously been reported that McKinney's contract with Glusman and his 
promotional agreement with Top Rank have been terminated. They have not. 
</P>
<P>
"When prior to this incident (the arrest) he hadn't come to the gym for a 
couple of days, he was running in the streets," promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank 
said. "Freddy Glusman was at his wits' end. The incident then occurred and 
Glusman and the investment group . . . well, it was embarrassing to them." 
</P>
<P>
Included in the group of investors who "bought" into McKinney are basketball 
Coach Jerry Tarkanian of the University of Nevada Las Vegas and the mayor of 
Las Vegas, Ron Lurie. 
</P>
<P>
Arum talks of a reconciliation between Glusman and McKinney. But Glusman said 
last week, "I have no desire to talk to Kennedy McKinney." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, McKinney wants to start over, without the cliches. 
</P>
<P>
"That gold medal has such a high standard in boxing," he said. "That's not too 
good, either. I had to drop my pride down a little bit and start all over 
again. Forget that I'm a gold medalist. Work toward my goal -- world champion. 
</P>
<P>
"All this has happened and I've taken a good, long look at myself. It's time to 
start all over. Set some new standards. That's what I'm going to do. To myself, 
I'm not the gold medalist anymore. To myself I'm a young boxer struggling to be 
a world champion."

TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE FOR TRACK?; 
</P>
<P>
LAND DEAL CAN'T HALT DROP IN PRICE OF STOCK IN HOLLYWOOD PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last thing shareholders in Hollywood Park expected to see in the past week 
was a drop in the price of the stock of their ailing race track. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Hollywood Park was able to announce on Sept. 11 that it had made 
still another deal to sell Los Alamitos, the track it owns in Orange County, 
and it appears that a sale will actually take place. More than $100 million in 
debt, Hollywood Park is to receive about $71 million when the Los Alamitos sale 
is completed in two months. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Hollywood Park's stock has dropped several points and is headed toward 
the low of about $20 a share that it cost last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The drop in the stock reflected disappointment," said David Winters, a 
securities analyst. "The price Hollywood Park is getting for Los Alamitos is 
much less than the $100-million deal that fell through earlier this year, and 
this leaves the company with just the Inglewood facility, which is in need of 
refurbishing. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the sale of Los Alamitos, the company could still be about $50 million 
in debt, and it has not been a well-run company." 
</P>
<P>
Marje Everett, the 68-year-old chief executive officer of Hollywood Park and 
the track's largest shareholder with an interest close to 10%, evidently was 
among those who were disappointed. "When I heard what happened, I wanted to 
start walking West and not stop until I reached the ocean," Everett reportedly 
told Ed Allred. Allred is the physician and quarter horseman who was part of a 
group that tried to buy Los Alamitos for a sum, Allred says, that was several 
million dollars more than the offer Hollywood accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Everett said that she did not recall making that remark to Allred. "As far as 
I'm concerned I had a good relationship with both groups that were trying to 
buy the track," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The successful buyers are Lloyd Arnold and Chris Bardis, veteran harness-racing 
operators in California, and commercial developers Buzz Oates and Frank Ramos. 
Oates is a former board member of Wells Fargo Bank, which is Hollywood Park's 
largest lender. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 300 acres at Los Alamitos, less than half is needed to conduct racing. 
Hollywood Park's $100-million deal with SDC Development of Newport Beach 
disappeared earlier this year when the citizens of Cypress, where Los Alamitos 
is located, voted against commercial zoning of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Another major Hollywood Park shareholder disappointed by the sale of Los 
Alamitos is Tom Gamel. The second-largest Hollywood Park shareholder with about 
5.6% of the stock, Gamel has been trying to oust Everett since early this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal they made was one that could have been made six months ago," Gamel 
said. "It cost the company about $15 million." 
</P>
<P>
Gamel, who has a wide-ranging plan designed to restore Hollywood Park's 
national prestige, is trying to force his way onto the board of directors, and 
this week he told Everett that there would be a proxy fight unless some of his 
allies named to the board. 
</P>
<P>
Among those Gamel wants on the board are Gary Hamilton, the president of SDC 
Development; Barry Weisbord, president of Matchmaker Breeders Exchange in 
Lexington, Ky.; and J. R. Sturges, a commercial developer from Santa Barbara. 
Except for Gamel, none of his candidates owns a significant amount of stock in 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Everett had little to do with cutting the final deal that sold Los Alamitos. 
When Marvin Davis, the oil billionaire, was appointed to the Hollywood Park 
board and bought more than $1 million of Everett's stock, his office took over 
the company's serious negotiations for the purchase of Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' representatives were reportedly unhappy with the offer from Allred, 
because one of his prospective partners was PacTel Properties. 
</P>
<P>
"Davis' people felt that they were dealing with people at PacTel who didn't 
fully realize what they were getting into," said a source familiar with the 
negotiations. "That left Arnold and Bardis as the only true bidders." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold and Bardis also had more clout with Hollywood Park than Allred and his 
quarter horse friends, because they represent a harness industry that had at 
least two lawsuits pending against Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Allred, who heads a quarter horse group that has a lease to conduct racing at 
Los Alamitos until the year 2002, still doubts whether the latest deal to sell 
the track will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have serious reservations about whether the closing will take place," Allred 
said. "The amount of money up front -- $500,000 -- was so small that it was 
ridiculous. I don't think the final chapter has been written on this 
transaction yet." 
</P>
<P>
Allred, a partner with Dee Hubbard in Ruidoso Downs, a quarter horse track in 
New Mexico, is already turning to other fronts, including modest plans to build 
a track in Southern California, which would have a limited racing season and 
stay open the rest of the year for betting on races from other tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"When we present our proposal to the California Horse Racing Board, it will be 
so inviting as a money maker for the state that there won't be any reason to 
turn it down," Allred said. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park bought Los Alamitos in 1984 for about $58 million. It has paid 
about $25 million in interest on the bank loan since then, and the track also 
paid Arnold and others more than $9 million to secure harness-racing licenses. 
So the sale to Arnold and Bardis represents a loss of more than $20 million on 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting of the Hollywood Park shareholders is scheduled for Dec. 8. 
The annual report has not been issued, but based on reports already filed with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, Hollywood Park's losses will total 
about $10 million for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The balance sheet for 1989 will not be any better, despite substantial revenues 
for the second straight year from off-track betting that Hollywood Park takes 
on the races from Del Mar. This year, Hollywood Park has been unable to further 
capitalize the interest on Los Alamitos for land cost and investment. 
</P>
<P>
The key player in the Hollywood Park scenario used to be Everett, who has 
managed the track since 1972. Now that role belongs to Davis, 64, who owns only 
about 1% of Hollywood Park stock. Davis told friends that he handled the Los 
Alamitos sale as a favor to Everett.

RULING RAISES CUP FOR SAN DIEGANS; 
</P>
<P>
YACHT OFFICIAL SAYS IT'S WHAT THEY EXPECTED ALL ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The club room of the San Diego Yacht Club was filled with lights, cameras, 
minicams -- and people. A sign on the wall read "Capacity 120 Persons," but 
many more were cramped inside. 
</P>
<P>
A banner on the wall bore a picture of the America's Cup with this inscription: 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome Home, Baby! Our Cup runneth over with joy! Sept. 19, 1989." 
</P>
<P>
A huge angel food cake at the front of the room was decorated with thick 
chocolate frosting that read: 
</P>
<P>
"Thumbs Up, Cup!" 
</P>
<P>
Francis S. Radford, vice commodore of the yacht club, called the symbol 
appropriate, saying that Tuesday's 4-1 decision by the appellate division of 
the New York Supreme Court -- overturning the New Zealand challenge and giving 
the Cup back to San Diego -- was "like frosting on the cake . . . the outcome 
is what we expected all along." 
</P>
<P>
Gone was any talk that the matter might not be over yet. Michael Fay, head of 
the New Zealand Challenge, could still petition the court by Oct. 19 to have 
the case heard at a higher level. One point in San Diego's favor is that the 
higher court may elect not to hear the case, in effect upholding Tuesday's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
If that is the case, then the Cup will be contested in full grandeur here 
starting in the fall, 1991, almost four years after Dennis Conner, sailing 
Stars &amp; Stripes '87, won the Cup for the San Diego Yacht Club at Fremantle, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
So, in the meantime, San Diego celebrated the decision. Local officials 
estimated the Cup could mean a $1-billion windfall for city coffers. Sailing 
syndicates from a legion of foreign countries could begin arriving in the city 
as early as the fall of 1991, with championship races being held in May, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Radford and Thomas F. Ehman Jr., the executive vice president and general 
manager of the America's Cup organizing committee, told reporters and yacht 
club members that they expected the Cup to remain in San Diego and that 
preparations for the '92 defense would begin, in Ehman's words, "immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Radford said the San Diego Yacht Club had spent "more than $1 million" on legal 
fees in the past year, although he declined to give an exact amount. 
</P>
<P>
While conceding the legal battle as "acrimonious" and "unfortunate," he said 
the "perverse side effect" was that awareness of and interest in the America's 
Cup had never been greater. He said that San Diego, more than any host city 
before it, would be the direct beneficiary of an "unintended but very effective 
marketing campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Mitchell, a spokesman for the America's Cup organizing committee, agreed: 
</P>
<P>
"The long-term impact (of the legal battle) is that it's made the event more 
popular than ever. People who never heard of the America's Cup have heard of it 
now. There was a Gallup Poll last year that pointed out that 79% of the 
American public had heard of the Cup. That's incredible. 
</P>
<P>
"As recently as 1983, we were dealing with an event that wasn't all that 
popular in terms of international recognition. So, in the long run, it's great 
for us. We win in several ways. 
</P>
<P>
"We win not only in the sense that controversy sells newspapers, but now 
there's an incredible sense of cooperation between challengers and defenders. 
No one wants this kind of bitter acrimony to surface ever again. Everyone has 
agreed to a new class of boat, and now we're ready to get on with the race." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego community leaders were obviously optimistic. Vince Benstead, 
president of the Greater San Diego Sports Assn., said by hosting the 28th 
America's Cup San Diego's status as a sports city would rise. He alluded to 
such other events as Super Bowl XXII and the America's Cup Challenge in 1988, 
San Diego's being named the site of the 1992 baseball All-Star game (the 1978 
game was played here), and "Now this," he said. "I can't think of a more 
deserving place." 
</P>
<P>
Benstead said that committees would soon be formed to "organize the event in 
every way, shape and form." He said that "every last detail" would include 
planning on the part of the city, the San Diego Police Department, the Coast 
Guard, the Navy, the Board of Port Commissioners, the San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce and the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Radford said that May of '92 was picked because February to May "offers the 
best four-month window in San Diego from everything to wind and weather to 
hotel space. We're looking at a terrific event."

GIANTS MAY MISS DORSEY MORE THAN JOE MORRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY HASTY, Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deficits do not seem to scare the New York Giants. And mistakes have not 
haunted them. 
</P>
<P>
The one frightening aspect of the Giants' 24-14 victory over the Detroit Lions 
on Sunday was the broken metatarsal bone suffered by left defensive end Eric 
Dorsey. It was an injury that could weaken the defense for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey is not expected to return after breaking the bone that connects to the 
little toe on his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he could even hope to be back for the regular season. Basically, 
it's very much like Joe Morris' (injury) and may be even a little more 
serious," Giants Coach Bill Parcells said Monday. "He's a bigger man. There's 
more pressure (on the foot). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any hopes he can come back. I think you have to figure he's gone 
for the year. That's the way I feel right now." 
</P>
<P>
Any Giant satisfaction felt from a second consecutive come-from-behind victory 
was wiped out by the loss of Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
When Morris broke the second metatarsal bone in his foot in the final 
exhibition game, the loss of the team's all-time leading rusher was a blow to 
the offense. But the Giants could turn to Ottis Anderson, the National Football 
League's 10th all-time leading runner, and still have capable veterans in 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Such is not the case on the defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
In the final weeks of preseason, the Giants realized that John Washington was 
their only adequate backup and they were actively seeking to trade for a 
lineman. Dorsey's injury leaves five linemen: starters Leonard Marshall and 
Erik Howard, Washington, Robb White and Mark Duckens. 
</P>
<P>
White is in his second year. His only playing time last season was on special 
teams against the New Orleans Saints and he has been slowed by a sprained right 
knee since the final exhibition game. Duckens, a first-year free agent, spent 
1988 on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, right now (it's the worst spot for an injury to happen) because we don't 
have a lot of experience, Parcells said. "We had four guys (with experience); 
now we have three. We're down to five linemen and (Duckens) has only been here 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
"You can certainly see we're not in too good of shape in that spot." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants haven't even committed to putting Dorsey on injured reserve, nor has 
a decision on surgery been made. 
</P>
<P>
It was unusual to see someone as massive as Dorsey stopped for the season 
simply by chasing after Lions quarterback Bob Gagliano. One wrong turn of 
Dorsey's right foot has had far-ranging repercussions for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells wouldn't go through his options, but Washington will probably slide 
over from right end to Dorsey's spot. Defensive line coach Lamar Leachman said 
Washington would more than likely have to make the switch to the other side of 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll do a good job," Leachman said. "He has got some experience and 
he's played every spot across the board. I think he'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Washington, a third-round pick in 1986, has steadily improved in four years 
with the Giants, but he has started only five games. He started the opening two 
games last season for the injured Marshall and played in all 16 games, 
finishing with 12 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a good chance I'll move over to the left side next week," 
Washington said. "But I'll have to be ready regardless of the situation. I hate 
to see that happen to Eric. He was playing pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Inserting Washington into Dorsey's spot doesn't completely solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, 6-foot-4 and 275 pounds, isn't an adept pass rusher and the second 
half of the Lions' game illustrated how important pressure on the quarterback 
is to the success of the secondary. Duckens was used mainly as a pass rusher by 
the Redskins, but his ability to stop the run is unknown.

The longest unbeaten streak in high school football ended at 55 games when 
Central Bucks West of Doylestown, Pa., was beaten, 13-10, by Cardinal O'Hara of 
Springfield, Delaware County, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
West led, 10-6, when, with 2:37 to play, O'Hara quarterback Kevin Byrne 
completed a 22-yard touchdown pass to Fred Steigerwalt on a third-and-10. 
</P>
<P>
The game had been scheduled for Sunday at Springfield, but was set back to 
Monday and moved to Doylestown because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
West, which had last lost Nov. 24, 1983, had its winning streak snapped last 
year in a 14-14 tie against Central Bucks East. Monday's loss prevented West 
from tying the Pennsylvania prep unbeaten streak of 56 games, set by Braddock 
High School from 1953 to 1960.

NEWSWIRE: SOVIET WEIGHTLIFTER SEEKS ASYLUM AT THE TURKISH EMBASSY IN ATHENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
World champion Soviet weightlifter Hafiz Suleymanov and his Soviet trainer 
sought asylum at the Turkish embassy in Athens Tuesday, a Turkish Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Suleymanov, 22, won the featherweight world title Saturday at the World 
Weightlifting Championships in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
The Turkish spokesman said the weightlifter and his trainer, Vitali Strobov, 
had gone to the embassy early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Athens, Soviet team leader Nikolai Parkhamenko said: "Suleymanov has been 
missing from his hotel room since 10 a.m. We have been looking for him since, 
but we don't know where he went." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials in Ankara said a chartered plane would be sent to Athens 
to take Suleymanov to Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Suleymanov came from Sumgait in Soviet Azerbaijan, where it said 
the population was largely of ethnic Turkish origin. 
</P>
<P>
Parkhamenko said: "I would be most surprised if he defected because everybody 
is free to go anywhere he wants. But if his defection is true, I am sorry for 
him. He is very young . . . and had the best facilities in the Soviet Union 
available to him."

CALLER USES THREAT BY PHONE TO ROB CLOTHING STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An anonymous telephone caller robbed a Cypress clothing store, telling 
employees that he had the store under surveillance and would open fire unless 
they left their cash at a nearby pay phone, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
By the time police arrived Monday night, the money bag was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there have been at least six similar telephone extortion attempts 
in Orange and Los Angeles counties this summer. Stores in Fullerton, Artesia 
and Whittier have been hit, as well as three merchants in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Some store clerks have hung up on the caller. But others have handed over their 
money, at least twice to an accomplice posing as a shopper inside the store. 
</P>
<P>
"What I think this guy is doing is at random calling people, and every once in 
a while he gets lucky and people give him the money," said Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Deputy David Brant, who has been investigating the phone caller 
heists. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress police said employees at Suzie's Deals, a women's clothing store in the 
6800 block of Katella Avenue in Cypress, were preparing to close at 9 p.m. 
Monday when the phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy said he was watching the store," said the clerk, who asked not to be 
identified. "He said to take the money out of the safe and the register, put 
the money in a bag and put it in the phone booth (outside a nearby store). And 
if I didn't do it, he was going to open fire on the store." 
</P>
<P>
The woman said she gave the bag containing $483 to another clerk, who dropped 
it at the pay telephone. When she returned, the employees called 911. 
</P>
<P>
By the time police arrived and surrounded the store, the bag was gone and there 
was no sign of the extortionist, Cypress Police Lt. Phillip Satterfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Police Detective Dan Flanagan said similar threats were made at 
Kidsmart, Jack-in-the-Box and Payless Shoesource stores in July and August. In 
the first two attempts, the caller used an accomplice to pick up the money. But 
in the third, he was working alone, Flanagan said. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases the caller has told employees he has a gun and also has told 
them: "We have locks on you," and "I have you in my scope," police said. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Police Detective Don Heckel described an Aug. 6 robbery of a Van's 
Tennis Shoes that was nearly identical to the one in Cypress. Store employees 
left a bag containing $350 at a nearby dry cleaners. The caller even reminded 
employees to empty the safe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Cypress robbery) sounds exactly the same," Heckel said. "That's the same 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
Brant said he suspects more attempted robberies have gone unreported by 
businesses that have dismissed them as crank calls. He said he has a possible 
suspect but has yet to make an arrest.

58-YEAR TERM GIVEN IN CHURCH ELDER'S KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reputed gang member was sentenced Tuesday to 58 years to life in prison for 
two slayings, including the murder of a Santa Ana church elder who was gunned 
down as he prayed in a telephone booth. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge J. Michael Byrne sentenced Todd Lavera, 
25, for his role as an accomplice in the first-degree murders of Leopoldo 
Salgado of Los Angeles and David Eugene Thompson, an elder of the Greater Zion 
Apostolic Church in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 27, of Tustin and Salgado, 48, were robbed and killed within 90 
minutes of each other in South-Central Los Angeles on April 9, 1987, during an 
attempt by Lavera and two other young men to obtain money to buy beer. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lack of any awareness of killing one person and then, a few 
minutes later, killing another person almost the same way," Byrne told Lavera. 
"The whole set of circumstances is outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Byrne also ordered Lavera to pay $10,000 each to the Salgado and Thompson 
families as restitution. Thompson's widow, Namora, and his two children now 
live in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"This is justice," Namora Thompson said after the sentencing. "It was really 
senseless, the whole thing. At least it will keep him off the street from 
hurting other innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
Lavera, who was not the triggerman, had faced life in prison without the 
possibility of parole. But Byrne reduced the punishment, saying there was not 
enough evidence during trial to show that Lavera intended to kill Thompson and 
Salgado. 
</P>
<P>
In June, a Superior Court jury recommended that Lavera be given the life 
sentence after finding him guilty of a special circumstance allegation, murder 
during the commission of a robbery. The charge qualifies the defendant for the 
death penalty or life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Although Byrne threw out the special circumstance finding, the prosecutor, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Arnold, did not oppose the ruling and said the 
58-year-to-life sentence was the maximum allowable. With credit for time 
already served, Lavera, a reputed member of the Hoover Gangster Crips street 
gang, could get out of prison in about 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Byrne gave me everything I wanted," Arnold said outside court. "They are 
vermin that prey upon the innocent of society." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Joe Ingber called the sentence too harsh, considering that 
Lavera was an accomplice and that one of the gunmen, Andre Moore, 19, was 
sentenced to 32 years to life in prison. He said he will appeal the case partly 
on the difference in punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"What this says is that Lavera should be punished more because he went to 
trial," Ingber said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who was 16 when the killings occurred, pleaded guilty to the 
first-degree murder of Thompson in exchange for dismissal of the charges from 
the Salgado killing. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said Moore was a juvenile when the crimes were committed and therefore 
did not qualify for special circumstance allegations. He also said Moore's plea 
made it unnecessary for Thompson's widow, Namora, to endure the pain and stress 
of repeated court appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"My response to Joe Ingber is that defendants who settle cases by pleading are 
rewarded," Arnold said. "Lavera went to trial. He was penalized, and every 
minute he was sentenced to is deserved." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold added that Lavera turned down an offer to plead guilty in exchange for a 
25-year-to-life term. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was killed in a telephone booth at Slauson Avenue and Broadway. Police 
said he had gone for help after a bus from his church broke down during an 
outing. As his wife waited in their car, three men accosted her, took $10 from 
her purse and then shot Thompson once in the head while he prayed. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the men took Thompson's 1986 Hyundai and drove to a liquor store 
where they bought beer and cigarettes. Arnold alleged that they returned to the 
store later and shot Salgado to death when he and his friend refused to give 
them money. 
</P>
<P>
Still awaiting trial on robbery and two first-degree murder charges is Tracy 
Lavell Carter, 21, of Los Angeles.

YORBA LINDA OKS CITY HOLIDAY ON NIXON'S BIRTHDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA HICKMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The birthday of former President Richard M. Nixon will become a holiday for the 
employees of Yorba Linda, the city that claims Nixon as its native son. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to judge history, we're here to recognize it," Mayor Henry W. 
Wedaa said. 
</P>
<P>
Wedaa said that despite Nixon's resignation from the presidency in 1974 under 
the cloud of the Watergate scandal, the proposal to commemorate his birthday 
has met with warm response. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the resolution was proposed, I have been amazed at the positive response 
that's come forth," he said. "Many of us have felt it was time for a holiday 
for President Nixon, and the time has come." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night to declare a city holiday each Jan. 
9, the day Nixon was born in a Yorba Linda farmhouse in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen years have elapsed since President Nixon's resignation, and history 
has shown the importance of his presidency, particularly with respect to his 
brilliance in foreign policy," the resolution said. 
</P>
<P>
Wedaa, who proposed the measure two weeks ago, said he hoped that the Richard 
M. Nixon Presidential Library now under construction in Yorba Linda will 
schedule special events for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The response from Nixon to having a city holiday in his honor is "that he's 
pleased," Wedaa said.

HURRICANE NEWS; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES RELY ON RADIO TIES TO CARIBBEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of Southland residents were besieging local ham radio operators 
Tuesday for word of relatives and friends on Caribbean islands who may have 
been in the path of Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
But with requests for emergency disaster assistance taking priority in ham 
communications to Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, most of those 
concerned are not likely to get their messages answered for several more days, 
according to amateur radio instructor Gordon West of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
But West said "no news is good news" in this situation, because if the 
relatives had been seriously hurt or killed, that information would be passed 
along quickly. As of Tuesday, 25 storm-related deaths had been reported in the 
eastern Caribbean, including two in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
That is little comfort to Cynthia Harper Miley. The Newport Beach woman has 
tried frantically to get word of her sister and brother-in-law, who were 
marooned on the tiny island of Culebra off the east coast of Puerto Rico when 
Hugo, packing 125-m.p.h. winds, struck Monday. 
</P>
<P>
With power and telephone communications knocked out in the Caribbean, Miley, 
37, asked a ham operator late Monday to try to track down her sister, Joan 
Foley, 45, and Foley's husband, Ed Burnsed, 48, on 
</P>
<P>
Culebra, where the two had been stranded since Saturday for emergency boat 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The word Miley got back Tuesday was not reassuring: Culebra's harbor, where 
Foley and Burnsed were towed after the engine of their boat stalled, was a 
scene of devastation, a ham operator told her. But no word has trickled out on 
casualties there. 
</P>
<P>
"I've cried all night," Miley said Tuesday, who is maintaining a vigil beside 
her telephone. "If we (her family) can at least hear there are not any 
casualties, and everybody is safe on the island, then we'll be fine. But now, 
I'm on pins and needles." 
</P>
<P>
West, who helps mobilize the county's 5,000 amateur ham enthusiasts in such 
disasters, said his network received about 1,000 calls in one three-hour period 
early Tuesday from county residents seeking information on loved ones caught by 
the hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
"I received 25 messages" in 45 minutes, West said. 
</P>
<P>
Such calls as Miley's are forwarded by West and the other ham volunteers to the 
National Amateur Traffic Network, which is relying upon East Coast ham 
operators to forward messages to hams in Puerto Rico, West said. 
</P>
<P>
The messages for information are given secondary priority to information on the 
devastated area, the hardest-hit communities and the need for medical aid and 
supplies, he said. After those messages are relayed, the radio operators in 
Puerto Rico will be asked to check on such people as Foley and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
West hopes that all of the responses come back as Message 1, which is the radio 
operators' code for: "Everybody safe here. Please don't worry." 
</P>
<P>
Less reassuring, however, is Message 26, which means: "Immediate help for sick 
and injured in evacuation needed at once." 
</P>
<P>
Any death announcements, West added, would be handled by the State Department 
or through other radio channels. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Gallant, 67, a ham from Newport Beach who has been monitoring his radio for 
nearly three days straight during Hugo's march, said information on casualties 
was still being tallied Tuesday. Gallant said radio frequencies have been 
filled, instead, with reports of damage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a disaster," Gallant said Tuesday as his radio crackled in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
It was Gallant who radioed Miley's request for information. Gallant said the 
response he received from the disaster region indicated that Culebra, about 40 
miles from Puerto Rico, had been pummeled. 
</P>
<P>
"The harbor was devastated, and all the boats are devastated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miley said her sister and husband -- retired and living on St. Croix in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands in their 40-foot yacht Hiatus -- had gone into Puerto Rico 
last week to refurbish the vessel and were on their way home when the engine 
failed. The vessel was towed to nearby Culebra, where Foley and Burnsed were 
last reported awaiting repairs Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Miley's sister, Beth Andrini, 40, of Costa Mesa, is also waiting anxiously for 
news, as is the rest of the family in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Another status request had been filed with local ham operators Tuesday by Lynne 
Weintraub, 43, a housewife from Orange whose friend, Joe Linares, along with 
his family, were caught in the storm. 
</P>
<P>
Linares lives near San Juan with his wife, four children and 82-year-old 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Miley, Weintraub heard back Tuesday that the Linares family is safe. 
Linares, 52, managed to call his sister -- Estelle Nash, 55, of Riverside -- 
from a business telephone that had been restored to service.

POLICE, FIRE GROUPS PLAN CHARITY EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Buena Park Police Officers Assn. and the Buena Park Fire Employees Assn. 
are sponsoring an event to raise money for several organizations, including the 
American Cancer Society, Boys and Girls clubs, Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
and the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program. 
</P>
<P>
Rich McMillen, community relations officer for the Buena Park Police 
Department, said the fund-raiser will be Sept. 28 at the Medieval Times dinner 
and tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for the public to realize that this fund-raiser has nothing to 
do with the city fund or salary increases," he said, explaining that both 
associations operate independently of city management. "We're just trying to 
give back something to a community that has been very good to us." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Gjersvold, president of the fire employees association, noted that not all 
money raised from the event will go to larger, better known charities. He said 
that, for example, the organization once gave $500 to a poor Buena Park family 
that had lost two sons within a short period of time. 
</P>
<P>
"There've been quite a few of the smaller, but just as important, causes that 
we've donated to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $25 each, and they are tax-deductible, McMillen said. To buy 
tickets, call the police association at (714) 521-9352 or the fire association 
at (714) 523-9797.

The La Habra City School District has completed the first step in a process 
that may result in the rehabilitation of school buildings on four of its eight 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
According to Supt. Rich Hermann, architectural drawings of the four school 
buildings scheduled to be upgraded have been submitted for review. He said the 
next phase depends on voter reaction to two proposed June, 1990, bond issues 
that would provide funds for the construction and rehabilitation of district 
school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Four schools now qualify for funding, Hermann said. The required paper work and 
architectural renderings are being completed for submission to state offices. 
</P>
<P>
Hermann said that school districts are prohibited by state law from using state 
lottery funds for buildings. The superintendent described his view as "mildly 
optimistic" regarding the chances that the bond issue will pass. 
</P>
<P>
The schools scheduled for rehabilitation include Walnut, Las Lomas and Sierra 
Vieta elementary schools and Washington Middle School.

FATAL PLANE CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
PASSENGERS, CREW MISS FERRY CAPTAIN'S CHEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The passengers and crew on many of Tuesday's early morning Balboa Island 
ferries were weeping over the loss of one of their own. Gerry Rene, the ferry 
captain who always had a joke and a smile for his passengers, was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Little by little, the news spread, silencing the ferry commuters who looked 
forward to seeing Rene each morning. 
</P>
<P>
Rene, 33, of Corona, and his friend, Robert J. Duffield of San Diego, 71, were 
killed Monday when Duffield's single-engine plane crashed on a rugged hillside 
near Escondido. Rene, who was divorced and had no children, leaves his mother 
and two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration investigators were examining the site Tuesday 
to determine the cause of the crash. FAA investigator Larry Lehr said there was 
a "strong possibility" that the plane broke up in flight. A memorial service is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got on the ferry to go to work this morning, everyone was crying," said 
Robert A. Foster, 67, an attorney who knew Rene well after years of commuting 
daily on the ferry from his Balboa Peninsula home to his office in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"The passengers and crew, everyone was crying," Foster said Tuesday. "One of 
the ladies taking the fares broke the news to me. It's just broken everybody 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Rene's supervisor at Balboa Island Ferry Co., Bob Snyder, said that Rene was a 
member of the Coast Guard auxiliary and that he believed that Rene and Duffield 
had been returning from a Coast Guard-related trip to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Swanson, office manager for the ferry company, said Rene had established 
an exceptional rapport with his passengers since he began making the 1,000-foot 
run between Balboa Island and the peninsula in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a cute, very well-liked fellow," she said. "Everyone who crossed 
on the ferry, Gerry knew them all by name and thought of them as family and 
friends. They all felt the same way toward him. Everyone's in shock." 
</P>
<P>
At Christmas, Rene often gave out free ferry passes that he had paid for with 
his own money, Swanson said. In exchange, he often left his boat at the end of 
his shift with an armload of home-baked cookies and cakes given to him by his 
passengers, she added. 
</P>
<P>
His were loyal riders, too. Swanson said clusters of passengers would wait on 
the dock, forgoing the ferries that came and went every few minutes, until they 
saw Gerry at the helm, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rene "always had a joke for his passengers and knew all about the details of 
their lives," recalled Snyder, his supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his popularity, Rene had told The Times in 1984 that he didn't think he 
deserved the title "captain" because his boat was "nothing more than a 
glorified barge." 
</P>
<P>
Seafaring became part of Rene's life at 14, when he entered the Sea Scouts, 
according to co-workers. He later spent four years running boats to 
oil-drilling platforms off the California coast and piloted tugboats in Long 
Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, he taught seafaring skills to boys in the Sea Scouts and coached 
teen-agers studying for their Coast Guard pilot's licenses, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe," Snyder said of Rene's death. "This morning, I went to 
work at 6:40 a.m. and he wasn't there. He's ordinarily there at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first morning since 1984 he's ever been late."

INMATE ON TRIP FOR SUPPLIES ESCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County sheriff's deputies were seeking a jail inmate who escaped in 
Santa Ana on Tuesday while on a trip with a jail employee to buy supplies, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
David Lawrence Barmore, 20, who was being held at the Theo Lacy branch jail in 
Orange on bench warrants in connection with burglary and car theft, jumped from 
the jail employee's car about 11 a.m. and ran toward the corner of Edinger 
Avenue and Fairview Street in Santa Ana, Sheriff's Department Lt. Jay Mendez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Barmore is described as white, with brown hair and hazel eyes, about 5 feet, 11 
inches tall and weighing 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He was last seen wearing blue jeans and a white T-shirt with 'Orange County 
Branch Jail' stenciled on them, and white tennis shoes," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
Details were sketchy on why Barmore was with the civilian jail employee, Mendez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information on Barmore's whereabouts is urged to call the Sheriff's 
Department at (714) 647-7000.

HUNTINGTON BEACH OKS INSURANCE-LIKE AMBULANCE FEE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH WILLIAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an attempt to improve emergency response time by as much as 25%, Huntington 
Beach has introduced a new program under which residents pay an annual fee -- 
much like insurance -- for emergency medical service. 
</P>
<P>
The program, approved by a 4-3 City Council vote Monday, will offer residents 
yearly memberships for $36 per household. Paramedic fees and ambulance charges 
would be covered for those enrolled in the Fire-Med program. 
</P>
<P>
For those who choose not to become members, the cost of emergency medical 
service will range from $100 to $150 for advanced life-support services. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope that the fees will raise about $70,000 per year to fund the 
administrative side of Fire-Med, a voluntary insurance program that officials 
hope will achieve five-minute response times in 80% of all emergency calls. 
Currently, only about 55% of emergency calls are answered within five minutes, 
according to Fire Chief Raymond C. Picard. 
</P>
<P>
Picard said the plan will begin in January, with participation expected at 
about 30% of the city's 76,000 households in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
While Huntington Beach residents can sign up for the program, it will not be 
offered to non-resident guests or short-term visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The new funds will upgrade the city's existing emergency response system by 
adding two additional vans that will join the paramedic fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Other benefits include a database that will store personal medical history for 
participating members and automatic notification of designated relatives or 
others in the event of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program is a voluntary system, Picard insists that high-quality 
life-support and emergency services for non-paying members of the community 
will still be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of a person's ability to pay, people will still receive the same 
level of service. There is no check within the system that will determine if a 
victim is a member or non-member," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics claim that the system might conflict with federal Medicare guidelines 
and that it fails to provide compensation to the city of Fountain Valley, which 
frequently supplies emergency services to households and businesses that lie 
within Huntington Beach but are closer to Fountain Valley fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
Voting to approve the user fees were council members Don MacAllister, Grace 
Winchell, John Erskine and Peter M. Green. Dissenting votes were cast by Mayor 
Wes Bannister and council members Jim Silva and Tom Mays. Fire-Med is based on 
a program that was originated in Springfield, Ore., and which is now offered in 
the cities of Santa Ana, Orange, Fullerton, La Habra and San Clemente, Picard 
said.

TUSTIN TO FIGHT PORN, SEIZE NEWS RACKS ON CITY LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WHITCOMB 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acting to curb the distribution of sexually explicit publications, the Tustin 
City Council has moved to confiscate 35 news racks on city property. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided unanimously Monday that the racks will be impounded if not 
removed by their owners within in three days after receiving a notice from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Most news racks in the city are on private property and thus will not be 
affected by the council's policy. Only a few of the news racks on city property 
contain sexually explicit publications. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to take swift action on this," said Councilman John Kelly, asking the 
council to enforce a 1973 ordinance that bars obstructing city streets or 
alleys. Kelly said the city has failed to enforce the ordinance in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The council took the action in response to concerns over racks containing 
adult-oriented publications. Council members said the appearance of the 
publications on city property did not fit the image Tustin is trying to 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"I think each of us on the City Council is committed to preserving a wholesome, 
positive life style," Councilman Richard B. Edgar said. "The challenge is to 
preserve that life style." 
</P>
<P>
But the council did not agree on what to do with any racks seized on public 
property. Kelly urged the council to destroy them and the publications or send 
the racks "back to wherever they came from," at the owners' expense. 
</P>
<P>
But Edgar and Councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey objected, with Hoesterey 
suggesting that the city auction any seized racks. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know where all these newsstands came from," Hoesterey said. "I don't 
want to have to mail them across the country or up to San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
The council had confiscated some racks containing sexually explicit 
publications last month, when Councilman Earl J. Prescott spotted them on 1st 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
But City Atty. James G. Rourke had them returned after telling the council that 
a Supreme Court decision prohibits the removal of news racks on the basis of 
content. 
</P>
<P>
Rourke said most of the racks on city property belong to The Times Orange 
County Edition, the Orange County Register and the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner. 
He cautioned council members that the city would "not be well advised to start 
picking up stands and carting them off." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for The Times' circulation department said just three of the 
paper's 66 news racks in Tustin would be affected by the council's action. 
However, the paper has asked to meet with city officials to discuss the policy. 
</P>
<P>
"While it will have little effect on circulation, the problem you get into is 
that it sets a precedent," said Al Brewer, street sales manager for The Times. 
"No matter if it is one rack or many, it is of the same importance." 
</P>
<P>
Brewer said The Times will try to work with city officials to reach a 
resolution that meets the needs of all parties. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Wallace, general manager of the Orange County Register, said he did not 
think the move would have much impact on the newspaper's circulation. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our racks are on private property, so we don't anticipate any 
problems," Wallace said.

LOS COYOTES GREENS COULD BE MEAN FOR LPGA TOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK WALTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the LPGA returns to Orange County on Thursday after a two-year absence, 
the players will find the golf course they are playing on in Buena Park, a city 
known for its amusement park, anything but amusing. 
</P>
<P>
The field in this inaugural 72-hole event, called the Nippon Travel -- MBS 
Tournament, will be strong, but even the most skilled players on the tour will 
be tested at Los Coyotes Country Club, a shapely patch of nature three miles up 
the road from Knotts Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
The course is longer than the normal LPGA layout, at 6,350 yards. Of the 33 
courses on the tour's schedule, only 11 play longer than 6,300. But distance 
alone is not what will make Los Coyotes a test. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the summer a fungus got into the greens and ate away the roots of 
grass, leaving bare patches scattered around the putting surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the persistent efforts of the greenskeeper over the past few weeks to 
rebuild and strengthen the weakened parts of the turf, some blotches remain, 
although the greens are now reasonably playable, according to the LPGA's 
on-site man, Jim Haley. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a lot better than they were five weeks ago, and they should improve 
each day," Haley said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The sensitive greens can't be cut as close as the LPGA normally prefers, so 
they will be slower and perhaps less true. 
</P>
<P>
This has a direct impact on the score card, since the correlation between play 
on the greens and scoring is very high. The slowness of the greens will keep a 
lot of scores bunched around the 68 to 71 range, players said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The players are coming off consecutive weeks in which they putted on very fast 
greens. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week's greens were so fast and so smooth, it's going to take a couple of 
days to get a feel for these," Pat Bradley, one of the tournament favorites, 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some rough spots and the ball is not going to roll true all the 
time, I don't feel. As putts start to die at the hole, they will start to 
jump." 
</P>
<P>
Scores were high the last time an LPGA event was played at Los Coyotes. In 
1971, when Kathy Whitworth, Sandra Haynie and Sandra Palmer were the leading 
economic indicators of women's golf, Whitworth won the Suzuki Internationale 
with a three-round score that was one-over par. There were only three over-par 
victories in 21 tournaments that year. 
</P>
<P>
Whitworth, who is entered in the tournament, is admittedly not playing well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do well to make the (36-hole) cut," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitworth says the long hitters will have an upper hand on this course. She 
favors Bradley, Beth Daniel and Nancy Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Those players and others who can hit long will have a chance to reach two of 
the par fives on the course in two shots, and those holes also will be the best 
opportunities for birdies. 
</P>
<P>
The course is in good condition overall, Whitworth said, but the conditions of 
the greens will keep the scores from skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
"The greens are bumpy, but that's just one of those things," she said. "They'll 
get better each day we play, but they will still be slow." 
</P>
<P>
The course conditions seem to favor Lopez, Whitworth says. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy is a very good slow-greens putter. She hits long enough and is a good 
front-runner," Whitworth said. 
</P>
<P>
That will be important this week. The finishing holes are not set up for any 
come-from-behind heroics. A player with a two-shot lead coming into the final 
four holes will be almost impossible to catch. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, this season's third-leading money winner and last year's player of the 
year, has won twice this year, the LPGA Championship and the Atlantic City 
tournament, and is seeking her fourth Vare Trophy, the award for the 
lowest-scoring average. With a 70.77 average entering this tournament, Lopez 
slipped into third place behind Daniel, but is close enough to remain highly 
motivated. Lopez, who says her goal each year is to win the Vare trophy, was 
not in top form in Seattle last week. She was on medication for a thyroid 
condition and finished tied for 39th. And Lopez, whose repute for optimism is 
well established, seemed to have no problems with the greens. 
</P>
<P>
"I made more putts on these greens today than I did last week. The ball is 
rolling real well," she said Tuesday. Bradley says of Lopez, "I think Nancy has 
really been a much stronger factor when the greens haven't been to everyone 
else's liking." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel is the best player entering the tournament. She comes cruising in with 
regained confidence, having won three tournaments in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 7, she won her first tournament in nearly four years. Since then she 
has won two more, including the Safeco tournament last week in Seattle, giving 
her 17 career victories. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King, the tour's leading-money winner, is not in the tournament. She is 
taking some time off at home in Phoenix this week. She is assured of being this 
season's leading-money winner, having earned $654,132. The record for earnings 
in a year was $492,021, set by Bradley in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel is second on the money list at $443,101 with three official tournaments 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Several other competitors have a good chance to win. Bradley, who has been 
resurgent this season after overcoming a hyperthyroid problem last year, won 
the Centinela tournament in April and has finished second four times. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Rarick finished second in Seattle last week and won in New Jersey in May. 
Amy Alcott has won a tournament every year since 1975, except in 1987. Alcott 
won in Boston two months ago and finished second in Seattle. For this 
tournament, the front and back nines have been flip-flopped, primarily because 
No. 9 makes a better finishing hole for television, and its contours and steep 
hills make it superior for spectator viewing. 
</P>
<P>
Although, there is no television for the tournament this year, the LPGA hopes 
there will be in upcoming events. The tour has a three-year contract with Los 
Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
The reversal of the nines poses another difficulty for the players. The four 
finishing holes are all par fours, none are easy birdie holes, and two of them, 
No. 15 (394 yards) and 17 (384 yards) are distinct bogey holes. 
</P>
<P>

Plans are in the works to renovate the Saddleback College football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The college's foundation has listed a $2.2-million proposal as a capital 
project, meaning it's a priority. The group plans to raise the entire cost 
without help from the college. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium, which has one of the best playing surfaces in Southern California, 
is hampered by lack of seating, especially on the visiting side. The bleachers 
on the home side can hold about 2,000 and the visiting side about 500. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Saddleback College, Santa Margarita High School and Capistrano 
Valley Christian High School play football at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make the stadium a showcase for the community," said John McIntyre, 
director of the college foundation. "But, in fund raising, all you can do is 
set goals and hope you reach them." 
</P>
<P>
The first part of the three-phase plan calls for preparing the west side of the 
stadium for bleachers to replace two small portable stands, below a hillside. A 
trailer serves as the press box and the assistant coaches sit in two sheds. 
</P>
<P>
The bleachers would be moved from the east side to the west and larger press 
box will be built. 
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, locker rooms will be built close to the field. Now, the 
players must go down the hill at the north end of the stadium to enter locker 
rooms in the physical education building. 
</P>
<P>
Bleachers to hold a minimum of 4,000 on the east side of the field would be 
built in the final phase. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation is taking donations but plans to hold its first fund raiser in 
December to coincide with the PONY Bowl at Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"It will only be at the point when we have the funds will we be able to put a 
foundation to our words," McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre said there is no question the South Orange County needs a larger 
stadium. The largest stadium in the area is at Mission Viejo High School, with 
a capacity of about 4,500. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, El Toro played Mission Viejo in a Southern Section semifinal 
game, which had to be played at Orange Coast College. OCC's stadium holds about 
7,600. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, when Saddleback played Fullerton for the Mission Conference 
championship, bleachers from the swimming pool and tennis courts were placed 
along the visiting sidelines and end zones to accommodate the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Coaching changes: During the summer, three coaching changes took place in the 
county water polo ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Don Watson returned after being away for two seasons to coach swimming at 
Orange Coast. Watson, who coaches the men's and women's swim teams, coached 
water polo in 1985 and 1986. He has been the swim coach since 1980. His women's 
swim team has won the state title five of the past six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Watson replaces Bob Shupp, who resigned at the end of the season. OCC was 18-8 
last season and Shupp had a two-year record of 28-25. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Brown takes over at Fullerton, trying to rebuild a program that finished 
4-16 last season. 
</P>
<P>
At Saddleback, Flip Darr returns after taking a year off. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback was 25-9 and won the Orange Empire Conference under assistant coach 
Jack Dickmann , who took over for Darr. Dickmann, who was chosen conference 
coach of the year, returns to the assistant role he's held for seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Peters, Rancho Santiago wide receiver, is offering a challenge to 
defenders this season. He's wearing a hip towel that reads, "Catch Me If You 
Can." 
</P>
<P>
Peters had five catches for 135 yards and had 226 yards in all-purpose yards as 
Rancho Santiago defeated Citrus, 34-14, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Blaise Bryant is off to a better start this fall at Iowa State then he was last 
fall at Golden West. Bryant has rushed for 311 yards in two games at Iowa 
State. Last fall, he ran for 198 yards in the first two games at Golden West en 
route to his nation-leading total of 1,691 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Bryant didn't have to face Oklahoma and Nebraska last season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's football team received 12 first-place votes and remains atop the 
weekly Southland Poll. El Camino is second, Bakersfield is third, Mt. San 
Antonio fourth, Cerritos fifth, Rancho Santiago sixth, Moorpark seventh, 
Pasadena eighth, Long Beach ninth and Santa Monica 10th. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton men's soccer team is off to a 5-1-1 start, the best in the 
13-year career of coach Jim Pasquale . . . Tim Reynolds, who hit .411 for 
Rancho Santiago's baseball team last spring, will have to sit out this season 
because of a knee injury. Reynolds, an infielder, had accepted a scholarship to 
Chapman, but suffered a serious knee injury this summer in a game in the 
Alaskan League. Reynolds, from Santiago High School, had reconstructive surgery 
on his left knee and wouldn't be ready to play until April.

JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON UNIT TO MARKET PREEMIE CATHETER MADE BY TUSTIN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Compiled by Leslie Berkman, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luther Medical Products Inc., a small Tustin catheter manufacturer, has signed 
a contract with a Johnson &amp; Johnson unit to market its device for 
intravenous treatment of premature infants. 
</P>
<P>
Tate Scott, executive vice president of Luther, said Critikon Inc. will sell 
the micro catheter under its own label. The product has been sold for about 
four years under the Luther label. 
</P>
<P>
"Critikon will place their own label on the product and will demonstrate it not 
only at hospitals but at trade shows," Scott said. "They have got more than 50 
salesmen for catheters in the United States alone, while we have none." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said the arrangement should "significantly increase Luther's sales." 
</P>
<P>
Luther's sales for the nine months ended March 31 were almost $1.7 million, up 
18% from the same period in the previous fiscal year. During the first nine 
months of fiscal 1989, the company lost $92,857, an improvement over a $596,482 
loss for the same period the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The improved performance was in part caused by Critikon's marketing of another 
Luther product, the so-called "stickless catheter," which protects health-care 
givers from catching infectious diseases from accidental needle sticks. 
</P>
<P>
Luther sold $556,000 worth of stickless catheters to Critikon in its fiscal 
year ended June 30, accounting for about a quarter of Luther's annual revenue. 
Critikon is taking steps to begin high-volume manufacturing of the stickless 
catheter, Scott said. 
</P>

Luther declined to disclose the value of the micro catheter contract. Compiled

FORGET NASHVILLE; DESERT ROSE MAY BE COUNTRY BAND OF '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As much as Nashville is the home of country music, it may be just as remarkable 
for the prodigal sons it has cast out. From the Bakersfield crowd through the 
outlaw and new traditionalist movements, the city's music establishment has 
been slow to welcome any new vitality in the music, and there may be no one 
more familiar with that slowness than Desert Rose Band singer Chris Hillman. 
</P>
<P>
After an incandescent new song, "Another Lifetime," during the band's late show 
Monday at Santa Ana's Crazy Horse Steak House, did Hillman sound just a bit 
bitter as he shouted: "That's not country music! You can't play that music in 
Nashville!"? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Music City's Country Music Assn. finally got around to nominating the 
Desert Rose Band in three categories this year, but it has only been about 21 
years since Hillman and his fellow Byrds first kicked on Nashville's door with 
the seminal country-rock album "Sweetheart of the Rodeo." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps to drive a point home, the band followed Hillman's outburst Monday with 
three Bluegrass-tinged numbers -- including its own "Time Between" and the 
Osborne Bros.' "Once More" -- that were about as country as you can get without 
worrying about deer-tick Lyme disease. 
</P>
<P>
With Hillman and guitarists Herb Pedersen and John Jorgenson erecting flawless 
three-part harmonies, and Jorgenson and steel guitarist Jay Dee Maness trading 
devilishly fast, song-hugging breaks, the group clearly didn't need any outside 
ratification to know it is onto a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Crazy Horse show, particularly the several new songs from an 
upcoming album, suggested the 4-year-old group (rounded out by bassist Bill 
Bryson and drummer Steve Duncan) is shifting into a higher gear. Although 
always possessed of remarkable vocal and musical prowess, the band's live shows 
haven't always connected on an emotional level. Monday, though, they 
practically burned the floorboards out from under them with a 22-song set that 
drew two deafening encore calls. 
</P>
<P>
Even Hillman, whose clear tenor vocals previously seemed to want for the 
consuming passion or charismatic flaws that so marked the singing of his Byrds 
and Burrito Brothers partner Gram Parsons, loosened up and howled a bit on the 
encores of the Burritos' "Christine's Tune" and "Sin City." 
</P>
<P>
The band ranged through a variety of styles, from the Bluegrass tunes to 
Pedersen's version of Buck Owens' "Hello Trouble" to a Louvin Bros. country 
shuffle to Dylan's "You Ain't Going Nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
If there is a signature sound to the Desert Rose Band, it is in the tasteful 
inclusion of '60s British Invasion touches into their arrangements. Although he 
can twang with the best of them (using an ultra-twangy six-string bass on some 
songs), Orange County-bred guitarist Jorgenson also added chiming 12-string 
guitar parts to "One Step Forward" and "Summer Wind" and the unique British Vox 
vibrato sound to "I Still Believe in You," which also featured a moving ballad 
vocal from Hillman. 
</P>
<P>
Songs from the new LP (due in January) included the driving, anti-drug 
"Darkness on the Playground," the country-pop "The Story of Love" and a 
banjo-powered Pedersen tune, "Fooled Again." Combined with the group's 
considerable legacy -- stretching back through Hillman's pioneering '60s work, 
Maness' stint with Buck Owens, and vocal arranger Pedersen's work with Emmylou 
Harris and others -- the Desert Rose Band may just become the country group of 
the '90s.

CIVIC PLAYHOUSE'S 'BABY' SCORES AS A VALENTINE FOR YUPPIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the program for Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse's "Baby," director Craig V. 
Fenter describes the musical this way: "Babies are cute. Babies are fun. Babies 
are charming. One would expect a show called 'Baby' to be the same. But . . . 
'Baby' is a show about realism (and) life and death issues that touch at the 
core of human existence." 
</P>
<P>
That's one interpretation. Another is that "Baby," cynicism aside, is a 
precious and fairly naive flattering of parenthood -- bringing up baby as the 
fullest of full experiences, a valentine for Yuppies with a mind toward 
procreation. 
</P>
<P>
It's the flip side of Christopher Durang's twisted slap at babydom, "Baby With 
the Bathwater," recently staged at Orange Coast College just a few blocks away 
from the Costa Mesa playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Sybille Pearson's 1978 show does aim for a realistic edge in 
places. The three couples the audience is asked to follow -- all white, all 
middle-class, by the way -- do have some big problems along the way. Mid-life 
crisis brought into focus by a surprise pregnancy, a low sperm count that makes 
conception difficult and the possibility of abortion come up. 
</P>
<P>
But as spryly as they surface, they are just as spryly resolved, all to an 
effervescent but redundant score that rarely finds the downbeat. We're supposed 
to root for these folks all the way through, and Pearson can't let the home 
team come up short on any score. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson has organized "Baby" into sort of a three stages of man, at least from 
a fertility standpoint: the youngest couple, Danny and Lizzie (Brian Harvey and 
Ann Milton),are about 20; the next couple, Nick and Pam (Grant E. Crowl and Pat 
Boldt), are around 30, and Alan and Arlene (Bil Barratt and Marisa Froton) are 
in their early 40s. 
</P>
<P>
Each, of course, has a different attitude about having a baby, all reflecting 
their places in the world. Danny and Lizzie, both college students, are giddy 
about the idea but aren't sure what the impact will be; they're kids about to 
have a kid. 
</P>
<P>
Nick and Pam, more settled, can't wait to have one, even though Nick keeps 
shooting blanks. The most interesting couple is Alan and Arlene, who now must 
decide whether having another family (their other children are in college) is 
such a good idea at this stage in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
There are many times when Fenter's direction is annoyingly upbeat -- even the 
infrequent somber moments have optimistic shadings -- but, in his defense, he 
does keep faith with the musical's general tone. Still, the few bits of grit 
Pearson tosses in, as when Nick and Pam go through an absurdly complicated 
ritual to ensure his meek sperm have a chance to find the target, don't have 
the satire they could. 
</P>
<P>
His cast plays it all pretty bouncy, too, often going overboard. But the voices 
are generally good, with varying degrees of technique and talent. Milton and 
Harvey usually shine the brightest. Fred Genge pleases in a brief appearance as 
a hyper obstetrician with faulty eyesight and an even faultier bedside manner. 
</P>

2 DRIVE-INS WILL REOPEN AT END OF WINTER, CHAIN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Orange County drive-in theaters have closed for the winter for the first 
time, citing declining attendance. The Times erroneously reported last week 
that screens in La Habra and Buena Park owned by Pacific Theatre &amp; 
Drive-Ins had closed permanently, along with a third Pacific drive-in in 
Orange, which remains open. A spokesman for the chain, which is based in Los 
Angeles, said the overhead of running the county theaters over the winter has 
not been offset by attendance, but he said the La Habra and Buena Park theaters 
will reopen in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The county closings are part of a larger cutback in the Los Angeles area by the 
chain and by at least one independent owner. The number of drive-ins continues 
to shrink, with the loss last week, at least temporarily, of a dozen screens. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific last week permanently closed five Los Angeles-area drive-ins with seven 
screens, in addition to the two Orange County theaters, which have four 
screens. An independently owned drive-in in Santa Fe Springs has closed for the 
winter, also for the first time, citing a lack of business. 
</P>
<P>
However, a theater marketing executive insists that the closings are 
"definitely not a death knell" for open-air viewing. 
</P>
<P>
Milton Moritz, Pacific's vice president for marketing, said because drive-ins 
"present an alternative way of seeing motion pictures that is conducive to the 
life style of many people," they will survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't say death knell," Moritz said. "Nothing is permanent in this business." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific owns 20 other drive-ins that remain open in the area, "and a lot of 
them are doing quite well," Moritz said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with those that have closed, he said, is that "a lot of these areas 
have changed, and their styles were not compatible for multiscreen theaters." 
</P>
<P>
Moritz said he agrees with industry observers who say that the multiscreen 
drive-in is the economic model of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said, the chain plans to stay with the La Habra theater, which 
has a single screen. "The theater definitely has a neighborhood following," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After the weather warms up again, "we'll keep it open as long as it makes 
(economic) sense." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Moritz added, attendance at the La Habra and the Buena Park 
theaters dropped off sharply after Labor Day, when the school year begins.

The Pacific drive-ins that have closed permanently include two in San 
Bernardino, one in Ventura, one in Lakewood and one in Burbank. Some of the 
sites are leased by the chain, Moritz said, while others are owned. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Pacific closed its Mission Drive-In, in San Juan Capistrano, which 
became the site of a shopping center. For the last four years, the number of 
drive-ins in the county has dwindled.

TAX FUNDS OFFER TRAUMA CENTERS A 'RAY OF HOPE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles county officials said Tuesday that the county's deteriorating 
network of emergency rooms and trauma centers could well be stabilized and 
possibly rebuilt with funds the county will soon receive from new taxes levied 
on cigarettes and tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman called the funds a "ray of hope on the horizon" for the 
county's beleaguered emergency services network. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen exactly how much money the county will receive from 
Proposition 99, the initiative passed last November that raised taxes on 
tobacco products. But the county's chief administrative officer, Richard Dixon, 
told the supervisors Tuesday that it will be enough so that "you will be able 
to stabilize the emergency room and trauma system and possibly begin rebuilding 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon's forecast came after a compromise was hammered out last week between the 
state Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian specifying how Proposition 99 
money will be spent. His comments came moments before a public hearing was 
convened by the Board of Supervisors to consider a report that recommends 24 
ways to improve emergency services in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The key finding of the report by the county Emergency Medical Services 
Commission is that the system's biggest problem has been "lack of money," 
Commission President Dr. Stephen L. Michel said. 
</P>
<P>
But others argued that the system needs an overhaul, not just better funding. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the system were drowning in money, we still would not have a 
well-managed, coordinated, unfragmented system," said Fred Hurtado, president 
of United Paramedics of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Network Called 'Abominable' 
</P>
<P>
Alan Cowan, chief of paramedics for the Los Angeles City Fire Department, 
blasted the emergency services network as "abominable." He said, "It makes me 
want to barf." 
</P>
<P>
He described a situation last week when up to 10 major hospital emergency rooms 
or trauma centers reported themselves full and, therefore, were allowed under 
county guidelines to temporarily close themselves to rescue ambulances. This 
left paramedics roaming around town with sick patients in search of an 
available hospital bed, Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he doubts that all the closures were legitimate and suggested that some 
may have occurred for financial reasons, in an effort to divert those patients 
who are unable to pay their bills. "There are hospitals inappropriately 
diverting patients all over this city." Cowan charged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disconcerting Frequency' 
</P>
<P>
Michel said in an interview that it seems that some hospitals close themselves 
to ambulance traffic with "disconcerting frequency . . . it gives me pause for 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials contend that the source of the problem is that too many 
patients -- many of them uninsured and unable to pay their bills -- are 
overwhelming a dwindling number of emergency facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the 10th trauma center of the original 23 permanently bowed out of 
the system. On busy nights, half a dozen of the remaining 13 may be full and 
temporarily closed, health officials say. As a result, millions of people 
living in wide swaths of the county are served by no trauma center at all, or 
by one that may well have no space when they need care. 
</P>
<P>
Troubled by the disintegration of the trauma center system, the Los Angeles 
County Medical Assn. last month passed a resolution pronouncing it "dead." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ways to Improve Care 
</P>
<P>
In its report, the Emergency Medical Services Commission recommended 11 
short-term ways of improving care without additional funding. These included 
determining the feasibility of activating Olive View Medical Center, a 
county-operated hospital in the San Fernando Valley, as a trauma center. 
</P>
<P>
Another recommendation was to determine whether a patient has medical insurance 
before deciding which hospital he should be taken to, provided this would not 
compromise his care. 
</P>
<P>
This recommendation drew fire from Hurtado, the paramedics union chief, who 
said it would "open a Pandora's box and increase the disparity that currently 
exists between those patients who can afford medical insurance and those who 
can't." 
</P>
<P>
The commission also recommended 13 long-term suggestions for modifying the 
county's emergency services network -- including the hiring of an outside 
consultant to study and evaluate the suggestions.

FOR 2ND TIME IN 2 WEEKS VAN NUYS ELKS REJECT 2 BLACKS AS MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two black men who tried to join the Van Nuys Elks Lodge were rejected Tuesday 
for the second time in two weeks -- a development likely to prompt more 
protests against the fraternal organization's policies toward racial 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The lodge's rejection of Jules S. Bagneris III and Thomas J. Montgomery came at 
a closed meeting that drew about 53 of the 370 members. Only 35 members voted 
in last week's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Elks officials would not comment on Tuesday's vote, other than to say that the 
two men could re-apply in six months. 
</P>
<P>
But some members said Bagneris' and Montgomery's bids to join the organization 
failed by a slim margin. 
</P>
<P>
Bagneris and Montgomery were sponsored by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), 
a lodge member. 
</P>
<P>
Rejected along with them Tuesday was Robbins aide Jack Sheffield, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
"There was not a proper basis whatsoever" for the rejection, Robbins said. "I 
am obviously disappointed. But if the majority of the membership were here, 
they would not have condoned or participated in racism." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said he is considering transferring to the Lompoc Elks Lodge in Santa 
Barbara County, which last week admitted two black members. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Van Nuys lodge said they were embarrassed by Tuesday's 
vote but planned to remain in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel awkward, but I also have friends in the Elks," said John Pulskamp, a 
member and former exalted ruler of the Van Nuys lodge. "The fact is everybody 
in United States has at least one friend who discriminates against others for 
racial reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Davis, acting exalted ruler, said the lodge should not be considered racist 
because "the charities we support extend to everyone, regardless of who they 
are or where they come from." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ran for Council 
</P>
<P>
Bagneris, 29, is a Lake View Terrace resident and minister at an African 
Methodist Episcopal Church in El Centro who ran unsuccessfully against Los 
Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi in April. Montgomery, 67, is a World 
War II veteran and a retired state Motor Vehicles Department examiner living in 
Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed, but I'm not disheartened," Bagneris said. "African-Americans 
historically have been despised and the struggle continues. This is 1989, there 
is no way I could expect this to occur, even in the San Fernando Valley.

GABOR GIVES A SLAM-BANG TALE OF ARREST; 
</P>
<P>
TESTIMONY REPLETE WITH EXPLETIVES CAPS WILD DAY IN COURTROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spirited Zsa Zsa Gabor took center stage at her criminal trial on Tuesday, 
capping a wild day in court with a colorful, slam-bang account of her 
altercation with a Beverly Hills policeman. 
</P>
<P>
"He hurt me like hell," Gabor said, testifying for the first time about Paul 
Kramer, the 6-foot-4-inch motorcycle officer who handcuffed and arrested her 
following a routine traffic stop in June. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'You f---, get out of the car,' " Gabor said. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, she said, Kramer reached through the window to open the car door 
and grabbed her by the wrist, pulling her out of her $210,000 Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You're Hurting Me' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Officer, you're hurting me,' " Gabor testified, delicately censoring 
many of the expletives that were allegedly a part of the exchange. "He said, 
'I'm going to break your f-ing arms and your legs,' again with the F (word). I 
was screaming -- 'You're hurting me!' -- And he liked it. He liked hurting me. 
He was smiling. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He was the toughest, nastiest, rudest person I ever saw in my life. . . . 
Officer Kramer was like a wild animal." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, who admitted slapping Kramer after she stepped from the car, claimed 
that the action was a "reflex" done in self-defense. "I don't even know why I 
hit him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, she said, she was brusquely handcuffed and bent over the trunk 
of the Rolls. Later, she was forced to sit on the curb, with her dress riding 
embarrassingly high on her legs, before being taken to police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Officer, I'm going to get a heart attack,' " she testified. "He said, 
'I hope you get an f-ing heart attack and I'll call the f-ing paramedics. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm a Hungarian Woman' 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she tried to resist being handcuffed, Gabor added: "I'm a Hungarian 
woman. I'm sure I was not being a milquetoast. I was probably trying to get 
away." 
</P>
<P>
The account -- which is expected to continue this morning -- differed markedly 
from Kramer's own testimony last week, in which he denied pulling Gabor from 
her car or swearing at her, except to say "quit (expletive) around" while he 
was applying handcuffs. According to Kramer's version, it was Gabor who 
unleashed a string of obscenities after he asked her three times to step out of 
the Rolls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kramer Hospitalized 
</P>
<P>
In a bizarre twist to Tuesday's events, Kramer was hospitalized after being 
thrown from his police motorcycle less than an hour before Gabor took the 
stand. The mishap -- within walking distance of Beverly Hills Municipal Court 
-- occurred when Kramer's cycle collided with a police patrol car as both were 
responding to a report of a suspected gunman on Rodeo Drive, said Police Lt. 
Robert Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer -- a 13-year police veteran -- was catapulted halfway across an 
intersection and temporarily knocked unconscious. He was in stable condition at 
UCLA Medical Center with severe bruises and scrapes, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gabor exhibited her most emotional outburst of the trial earlier in 
the day, bolting from court and returning in tears midway through the testimony 
of Police Officer Scott Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who had helped to take Gabor to jail, was recalling the arrest scene 
with Gabor sitting handcuffed on the curb. Thompson testified that as soon as 
he arrived to assist Kramer, "She (Gabor) looked at me and said, 'You mother 
(expletive), I'll have your job! I'm calling the Reagans on this!' " 
</P>
<P>
At that point in the testimony, Gabor stood and attempted to leave, muttering 
"I can't take this," as she marched toward the back doors of the courtroom 
chamber. Judge Charles G. Rubin stopped her, saying, "Will you come back here, 
Ms. Gabor?" He then admonished her against leaving the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sobbing Aloud 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the defense table, Gabor sat and began to sob aloud, dabbing at 
her eyes with a handkerchief. Rubin ordered a five-minute recess. 
</P>
<P>
As testimony resumed, Thompson gave a graphic account of Gabor seated on the 
curb in handcuffs, describing her demeanor as "hysterical." 
</P>
<P>
"She screamed her wrists were bleeding -- (that) she was bleeding," Thompson 
said. A check of her handcuffs showed they were actually rather loose, he 
testified.

KEY SUPERVISOR BALKS AT MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future for dozens of Los Angeles County mental health clinics facing 
cutbacks over a funding shortage appeared bleak Tuesday after a key member of 
the Board of Supervisors said he was unwilling to provide local funds to bail 
out the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana said it is the state's responsibility to rescue the four 
county clinics facing closure Oct. 1 and dozens of other privately operated 
clinics facing funding reductions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to do that," Dana said in an interview. "If we do it, we'll be 
doing it from here on out." 
</P>
<P>
Dana, who has been the board's swing vote on mental health issues, contended 
that he represents the majority on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors delayed a decision on the fate of the clinics until next Tuesday, 
their final meeting before the cuts are scheduled to go into effect. 
</P>
<P>
County Mental Health Director Roberto Quiroz told the Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday that his department needs $7.6 million to avert closing four clinics 
and reducing services at dozens of other publicly and privately operated 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature adjourned early Saturday without taking action on a bill that 
provided additional mental health dollars to counties. Gov. George Deukmejian 
pointed out that Los Angeles County is due to receive $360 million from 
cigarette taxes, some of which could be used to prevent mental health cuts. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Dixon, the county's chief administrative officer, told supervisors 
that any diversion of cigarette tax money for mental health will cause cuts in 
services at county hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Property Tax Revenue 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors could dip into an estimated $12-million windfall in property tax 
revenues discovered after last June's adoption of the county budget. 
</P>
<P>
But Quiroz said he has mixed feelings about a county bailout of mental health 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to cut services," he said in an interview. "By the same token, we 
would be delaying the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I happen to feel very strongly that this is a state responsibility," Quiroz 
added. "What we intend to do is live within the budget that the state has given 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Clinics targeted for closure, in addition to the three closed last June because 
of a budget shortfall, are El Camino in Santa Fe Springs, Hubert Humphrey in 
South Los Angeles, Northeast in Highland Park and West Valley in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clinics Facing Cuts 
</P>
<P>
Facing cuts in service are Arcadia, San Antonio, West Central, South Bay, 
Hollywood, Rio Hondo, San Pedro and Coastal clinics, plus dozens of privately 
operated facilities that rely on the county for funds. 
</P>
<P>
An organization representing private clinics said they plan to jam the 
supervisors' meeting next week with mental health workers and patients to urge 
the board to fund the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Mandel, president of Pacific Clinics in Pasadena and past president of 
the Assn. of Community Mental Health Agencies, said the mentally ill are caught 
up in a "power struggle because the Legislature and governor couldn't agree" on 
family planning legislation and a prisoner work plan -- a reference to issues 
that stalled the spending bill in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Mandel said the supervisors would be wrong to limit the county's contribution 
to mental health financing to 10%. "We're talking about peoples' lives here, 
not whether you have a 90-10 formula, and you stick to that in a rigid way," 
Mandel said. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the state auditor-general confirmed Tuesday that it 
plans this month to begin auditing the county Department of Mental Health's 
spending of state funds. The audit, requested in April by State Sen. Herschel 
Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), will address allegations that the county failed to 
spend all of its state mental health funding.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN, 25, SENTENCED IN DOUBLE MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reputed gang member was sentenced Tuesday to 58 years to life in prison for 
two slayings, including the murder of a church elder who was gunned down as he 
prayed in a Los Angeles telephone booth. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge J. Michael Byrne sentenced Todd Lavera, 25, 
for his role as an accomplice in the murders of Leopoldo Salgado of Los Angeles 
and David Eugene Thompson, an elder of the Greater Zion Apostolic Church in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 27, of Tustin and Salgado, 48, were robbed and killed within 90 
minutes of each other in South-Central Los Angeles in 1987. Prosecutors said 
Lavera and two other young men wanted money to buy beer. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole set of circumstances is outrageous," Byrne told Lavera. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne also ordered Lavera to pay $10,000 each to the Salgado and Thompson 
families as restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Lavera, who was not the triggerman, had faced life in prison without the 
possibility of parole. But Byrne said there was not enough evidence to show 
that Lavera intended to kill Thompson and Salgado.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO ENFORCEMENT FOR 'ENGLISH' ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Temple City ordinance requiring that at least 50% of all business signs be in 
English was allowed to remain on the books Tuesday to the surprise of two civil 
rights groups that had complained that the law was discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
But the City Council agreed to suspend enforcement of the ordinance -- a 
position it has taken since Aug. 1 when a federal judge struck down a similar 
ordinance in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
In a Sept. 6 letter to city officials, the Asian Pacific American Legal Center 
and the American Civil Liberties Union asked the council to repeal the 
ordinance, said Kathryn Imahara, an attorney for the Asian legal center. 
</P>
<P>
Had Temple City rescinded its ordinance, it would have been the first time a 
city in the San Gabriel Valley, which has a growing Asian population, 
voluntarily revoked such a law, said ACLU attorney Robin Toma. 
</P>
<P>
Temporary signs that do not use the Roman alphabet will be allowed in Temple 
City until an acceptable alternative can be reached with the civil rights 
groups.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWYER EMBEZZLED, STATE BAR ALLEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Fernando Valley personal-injury lawyer embezzled at least $125,000 from 
dozens of clients by settling insurance claims without their knowledge or 
consent and keeping the money, the State Bar of California alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Bar officials are seeking the disbarment of Richard F. Murkey, who they say 
swindled 29 clients and their doctors and committed a host of violations of his 
"oath and duties as an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Based on three of these cases, the district attorney's office has filed five 
felony counts of theft and forgery against Murkey, who is scheduled for a 
preliminary hearing today in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Murkey, 42, once accused by his grandmother of trying to cheat her out of her 
life savings, is temporarily prohibited from practicing law pending the outcome 
of formal disciplinary proceedings by the State Bar. A Bar Assn. referee ruled 
that he has "demonstrated a reckless disregard" for his clients and that his 
continued practice could cause "substantial harm to the public." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Leventhal, a Bar Assn. attorney, said when Murkey settled cases without 
consulting clients, he frequently accepted sums much lower than the clients 
would have agreed to. When clients discovered their cases had been resolved -- 
usually by contacting insurance companies directly -- Murkey wrote them checks 
that frequently bounced, the State Bar alleges.

He heard voices through the walls. The raucous, disembodied sound startled him, 
then fixed him to his chair. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all agreed that he has the potential for greatness, perhaps. All of his 
outside review letters are good." But "how do we know that if we give him 
tenure he won't go out and do something crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
This was no psychotic episode. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Reginald Clark had a firm grip on reality, he says, and he realized that 
the voices belonged to people he knew at the Claremont Graduate School. They 
were talking about him. They were discussing his professional future. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why, as I've been going around to these conferences.... I don't know if 
I want to work on a permanent basis with a black man." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to worry about that. We are a private college. We are not under 
any obligation to have any (minorities), it's the public universities that are 
under pressure right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Their deliberations were supposed to be secret, part of the Byzantine process 
academia employs when considering a candidate for tenure. But the closed-door 
discussion slipped through an air ventilation duct and led to an $8-million 
lawsuit against the prestigious, private Claremont school. 
</P>
<P>
Many claim that the issues raised by Clark's lawsuit symbolize the maze of 
discriminatory hurdles most minorities face when they seek tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who had been reviewing a film on the teaching methods of educator Marva 
Collins when he first heard loud voices wafting through the air vent, filed a 
civil suit in Los Angeles Superior Court. The 40-year-old African American 
education professor charges that racial discrimination was the reason for his 
denial of tenure and subsequent dismissal from the Claremont Graduate School's 
education faculty in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the defendants denied making any of the statements Clark 
claims to have overheard. 
</P>
<P>
His case has been championed by U.S. Civil Rights Commission chairman William 
Allen, who testified on his behalf, and local branches of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference and National Assn. for the Advancement for 
Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
At a U.S. Civil Rights Commission hearing in Los Angeles last September, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Los Angeles SCLC, called the decline 
and exclusion of black professors from the ranks of higher education "one of 
the most pressing civil rights issues of our time." 
</P>
<P>
There is a well-established relationship between social mobility and higher 
education. But, says Ridley-Thomas, "it is impossible to convey the importance 
of education to youth when institutional racism blocks the aspirations of those 
who dedicate their lives to academic endeavors." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this has been the cry of minority professors nationwide. A report on 
"Minorities in Higher Education" from the American Council on Education said: 
"The higher education community must continue to address the issues of losses 
in participation at all levels for blacks; the segregation of Hispanics; the 
retention and graduation of minority students, both undergraduate and graduate; 
and the lack of growth for minorities in faculty and staff ranks." 
</P>
<P>
Without more minorities on staff, Clark says, the social and intellectual 
climate of a university suffers. "The breaking of stereotypes will be hampered; 
the promotion of intercultural and interracial understanding and cooperation 
will be inhibited; and teaching and research concerns that might benefit from a 
minority perspective will be less adequately pursued." 
</P>
<P>
The tenure that Clark was denied is the goal of every professor -- a lifetime 
appointment that protects the academic freedom of university faculty engaged in 
teaching and research. It is awarded to scholars of exceptional distinction 
only after an intensive, thorough evaluation. The secret evaluation process is 
designed to ensure that intellectual attainment and 
</P>
<P>
not political and other irrelevant factors are considered. 
</P>
<P>
"The double-edged sword of secrecy allows them to do things in private, 
ostensibly to protect a candidate's interest," Clark says. "But it serves the 
purpose of allowing them to exclude people they don't want for reasons other 
than their competency." 
</P>
<P>
While Clark charged the Claremont Graduate School with racism, the school's 
attorney, Catherine Hagen, argued that it was his "meager" publication record 
and student criticisms of his teaching that led to his being denied tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, an expert on multicultural education, had written one book, "Family Life 
and School Achievement: Why Poor Black Children Succeed or Fail," published by 
the University of Chicago Press in 1983, when he was considered for tenure. The 
book was based on his original research, which showed that family habits and 
interactions -- as opposed to poverty, broken homes, race or ethnicity -- 
affected success in school. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the National Education Assn. selected the book as one of the seven 
best on education. 
</P>
<P>
"His publishing record is spectacular," asserts Clark's attorney, Godfrey 
Isaac. "The book has been called a trailblazer in his field." 
</P>
<P>
But one good book is not enough, the school's attorney maintains. If Clark 
could have gotten at least two more refereed journal articles published -- 
articles that published only after rigorous review by a panel of scholars -- he 
might have been granted tenure, says Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
Minority scholars, particularly blacks, charge that they cannot get published 
in mainstream, refereed journals because their work is often viewed as 
political, rather than scholarly, or focused on ethnic concerns, rather than 
mainstream ones. 
</P>
<P>
Though "publish or perish" has long been the refrain of professors seeking 
tenure, Clark's attorney argues that that was never the real issue. "They may 
claim that," says Isaac. "But nobody who has sat in a prejudicial mode ever 
says they're prejudiced. Therefore, one has to look at other factors to 
determine whether there was prejudice. In this instance, Clark was the first 
full-time black male faculty member in the school's history. There were never 
any minority faculty members before him. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people believe that discrimination is a numbers game. If so, it's a game 
that clearly indicates Dr. Clark was discriminated against," Isaac says. 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, he'd been honored by the school, they had a conference in which they 
featured him, they reveled in the publicity they got from his good work," Isaac 
says. "It was only when it came time to make him, in essence, a permanent 
member of the family" -- a tenured professor -- "that they ever balked." 
</P>
<P>
After four days of jury deliberation, Clark's case ended in a mistrial last 
April when three jurors fell ill. 
</P>
<P>
The case is to be retried Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Is Clark's attorney still going to ask for $8 million in damages? "At least," 
says Isaac. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nakanishi knows full-well that most whites are tired of hearing minorities 
yell foul when they don't get a job, or, in the case of tenure, are denied a 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than minorities admitting that they may not be able to meet the rigorous 
standards required to get tenure, many whites believe that minorities see a 
racist under every bed. And the average person, says Nakanishi, who waged a 
three-year battle for tenure at UCLA, is particularly loath to believe that 
discrimination occurs in the rarefied atmosphere of academe. 
</P>
<P>
But when you demystify the whole situation, you realize that ". . . 
universities are the same -- and some would argue that they are even worse -- 
than other types of places," says Nakanishi, whose tenure case became a cause 
celebre in the Asian American community. 
</P>
<P>
After an unusual campaign of petitions, letter writing and lobbying, UCLA 
chancellor Charles E. Young announced last May that he was granting tenure at 
the Graduate School of Education to Nakanishi. 
</P>
<P>
He deserved the appointment all along, said one of his supporters, State Sen. 
Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who chairs a committee on UC admissions. Torres 
called chancellor Young an "independent academic" who would have resisted the 
political pressure if Nakanishi had been a mediocre candidate. 
</P>
<P>
In part, Nakanishi's case came to symbolize issues of ethnic and intellectual 
diversity at American universities. As with Clark, who was the first full-time 
black male faculty member at the Claremont Graduate School, Nakanishi was the 
first Asian American in UCLA's graduate education school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
Some professors who reviewed him for tenure said his work was outside the 
education school mainstream, such as his studies showing low levels of voter 
registration among Asians in Los Angeles County. Detractors dismissed claims of 
racial prejudice and said his research was below UCLA's standards. 
</P>
<P>
His critics, says Nakanishi, don't understand his research. "They have no basis 
for understanding its significance . . . originality . . . creativity or 
rigor." 
</P>
<P>
With those words, he echoes the sentiments of numerous minority scholars 
engaged in what they consider to be path-breaking ethnic research, which they 
claim is inappropriately judged by Eurocentric values of traditional scholars. 
</P>
<P>
"My appointment was to develop an area on Asian Americans and education -- 
broadly defined," at the graduate school, Nakanishi explains. "I defined my 
approach in terms of issues of access, representation and influence of Asian 
Americans in the major social institutions -- none of which is divorced from 
education or politics." 
</P>
<P>
Nakanishi never had to file a lawsuit to win his three-year tenure battle at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
But Halford Fairchild had to. It could take five, six or seven years, however, 
before the case even reaches the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Fairchild, a former UCLA assistant professor in the department of psychology 
and the Center for Afro-American Studies from 1978-86, was denied tenure in 
1985 because, in the university's words, he lacked "superior intellectual 
achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Fairchild, a widely published scholar and former national president of the 
Assn. of Black Psychologists, says one of the committees reviewing him for 
tenure claimed that his work was "a-theoretical," the worst thing that can be 
said of a scholar, he points out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrote on Achievement 
</P>
<P>
He explains that he wrote a study on educational achievement. "I wanted to find 
out whether or not the size of the school and the amount of money spent in the 
school made a difference in how well the students did, on the average, on their 
test scores." 
</P>
<P>
The paper was part of his portfolio examined in the tenure review process. It 
was criticized, he says, because " 'Fairchild completely ignores the literature 
on social class and race.' I wrote back in the rebuttal statement that this was 
an obvious misreading of the paper. I had two lengthy discussions on social 
class and race with appropriate literature cited." 
</P>
<P>
What he refused to do -- and so challenged traditional approaches to research 
in his field -- was to look at race and social class as independent predictors 
of educational success. He argues that "one should not use social class and 
race as an independent variable in the statistical analysis unless one has a 
theory about social class and race. I take the position that, if you have a 
theory about race as a causal variable in educational achievement, then you are 
a racist, which I am not. . . . The arguments are parallel when it comes to 
social class." 
</P>
<P>
It's known, says the 40-year-old scholar, that "people who are poor score lower 
on achievement tests. But I don't think being poor makes a person have lower 
achievement. Instead, it is the quality of the neighborhood school, quality of 
the environment, the history of structured discrimination in the educational 
arena that accounts for the fact that poor people have low IQ tests scores." 
</P>
<P>
His approach, he says, raises fundamental questions about social science 
research. To suggest that neither race nor class are impediments to learning 
forces traditional scholars "to reject a whole history of research of which 
they have been a part. This shakes up the halls of academe." 
</P>
<P>
He is not the only minority professor to hear charges that his work is 
a-theoretical. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a charge that particularly plagues black scholars, says Ron Walters, a 
political scientist at Howard University, adviser to the Rev. Jesse Jackson 
during both his Democratic Presidential nomination bids and president of the 
National Congress of Black Faculty. The congress was formed in 1987 in response 
to discrimination against black academics in hiring and promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a bias, of course, that black people can't think theoretically," 
Walters said. "To think theoretically is a question of looking at facts and 
being able to derive a higher order of systematic relationships among them so 
as to explain phenomena. Theories are spun in order to help people explain 
phenomena, particularly social phenomena. It's a higher level of abstraction." 
</P>
<P>
But there are all sorts of things used to keep blacks and other minorities in 
ethnic studies from getting tenure. "One of the other things I've heard is the 
question of work being 'political.' " 
</P>
<P>
Says Walters: "The orthodox, i.e. the white interpretation of the world, is the 
objective one, and the black person's interpretation is political. And we 
haven't reached the stage in this society yet where there's anything like an 
objective perspective on racial phenomena." 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental issues in the Nakanishi and Fairchild cases are the same, says 
Dean Florez, a consultant to Torres' committee on UC faculty and admissions: 
"We are having a Pacific Rim, Third World movement in California, whether 
people want to see it as that or not, and they are knocking at the very basis 
of higher education -- that is a post-European education. And those stresses 
are being seen at the departmental level, with faculty and others arguing 
whether or not certain types of studies are in the norm of Western Civilization 
. . . or, if they are not, whether they are valid studies . . . That's the crux 
of the problem. Is a Post-European university ready for a majority of 
California that is basically Third World, Pacific Rim, Latin American and 
African American?" 
</P>
<P>
UCLA claims it is. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Young and the UCLA administration have been praised in the past for 
their support of diversity throughout the university and commitment to ethnic 
studies. A recently developed plan to increase recruitment of minority faculty 
in the College of Letters and Science, which employs the largest number of 
faculty, is further evidence of the campus' commitment to diversity, 
administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond L. Orbach, provost of the College of Letters and Science, designed the 
plan and views it as an all-out effort to bring the best minority scholars to 
UCLA, hire many as tenured professors and place others in tenure track faculty 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan is the best in California," Florez says. "People should try to mimic 
it around the state." 
</P>
<P>
The plan was needed because there was the perception -- a correct one -- that 
UCLA was not doing enough to get "underrepresented minority candidates," Orbach 
says. "What we had done was make available to departments faculty positions for 
minority candidates when the department identified a candidate." 
</P>
<P>
That's standard operating procedure at universities nationwide, he says. "But 
it just wasn't enough. . . . We had one black faculty member in one department 
and one Chicano faculty member in another and you don't change the nature of 
the academic program by that kind of hiring structure -- though in fact, we had 
met the federal guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
University officials say federal guidelines do not require them to hire any 
specific number of minorities. Affirmative action guidelines only require the 
university not to discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
Orbach says the target of his new recruitment effort is to attain a level of 
minority faculty representation that achieves "critical mass." 
</P>
<P>
What is that? "I don't know what that number is. . . . It is whatever is 
appropriate in a particular discipline or sub-discipline so that the insights, 
the concepts, the new scholarship," embodied in ethnic studies "have a chance 
to multiply and influence the education program and the research program." 
</P>
<P>
Critical mass is too nebulous a concept, says Florez, the legislative 
consultant. "Orbach has this very good plan but with no goals, no timetable." 
</P>
<P>
But the results of the recruitment effort in its first academic year, 1988-89 
has already produced an English department "approaching critical mass . . . in 
African-American literature," the provost says. "It will be the stellar group 
in (that field in) this country." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the minority faculty members in UCLA's English department are among the 
nation's most respected scholars in a variety of fields, not just ethnic 
studies. The department already has on its faculty Richard Yarborough, an 
expert in Afro-American literature and one of the editors of a compilation that 
will make publishing history when it appears in 1990: W. W. Norton &amp; C.'s 
anthology of Afro-American literature. The anthology, carrying the imprimatur 
of the nation's most prestigious publisher of literary anthologies, will 
effectively become the first canon of Afro-American literature. 
</P>
<P>
Helping UCLA reach its stated target of "critical mass" are six new minority 
faculty members: Valerie Smith, a tenured associate professor in Afro-American 
literature who was a tenured professor at Princeton University; Gregory Sarria, 
a Native American and professor of Native American literature; Robert Aguirre, 
a Latino professor whose field is Victorian literature; King-Kok Cheung, a 
professor of Asian-American literature; Arthur Little, an African-American 
professor whose field is Shakespeare and Renaissance drama; and Sonia 
Saldivar-Hull, an expert in Chicano literature. 
</P>
<P>
While some of the new minority faculty recruited by the College of Letters and 
Science have been brought in as tenured professors, others have not. 
</P>
<P>
Will a new "critical mass" of minority scholars, many in ethnic studies, 
encounter the same obstacles that Nakanishi and Fairchild allegedly faced when 
considered for tenure? 
</P>
<P>
Orbach points out that the percentage of faculty who are eligible for and 
receive tenure is about the same for minority and nonminority faculty: 70%. 
</P>
<P>
But Fairchild claims that many minority faculty are discouraged from ever 
applying for tenure during periodic reviews by their departments. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's true," says Orbach, "that's horrible." Assistant professors become 
eligible for tenure after seven years. "They have reviews by the department 
every two years. They have a formal assesment after four years, which is meant 
to be an early warning, but it's not meant to be punitive. It's meant to be 
informative." 
</P>
<P>
The real problem in tenure cases "happens at the level of dean in the 
individual departments," says Florez. "It's going to take a lot more pressure 
from the chancellor and from the provost to the department chairs," to change 
things. 
</P>
<P>
One of the things the Legislature can do, he says, "is to really get in touch 
with what's going on in the departments. We need to start looking at (denying) 
funding," that will directly affect these departments. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's chancellor has a different view: "That isn't the way to change things at 
a university. The members of the staff of Sen. Torres' office may not be the 
best people to judge. I think people in the university are in a better position 
to know what is going on. We have a very good process in place and one that is 
improving."

NEW RETAIL TACTICS MAKE EVERY DAY A SALE -- SOMEWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smart shoppers don't buy big-ticket items like new wardrobes, refrigerators or 
cars when the mood strikes. They track the sales in their area on a monthly 
basis, waiting until they know a particular item will be offered for less by 
department stores, specialty shops, discount houses or manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, for example, is the traditional time for finding bargains on coats, 
hosiery and rugs. But, because of the proliferation in the last few years of 
retailers' one-day sales, you also may be able to spot a September or October 
sale on tires (usually in May), baby products (January and May), or diamonds 
(January). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One-Day Sales Lose Favor 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s the one-day sale has become a popular merchandising tool, but 
there are signs that retailers will be cutting back on these sale days and 
offering lower prices in general. "There's a plethora of sales compared to 20 
years ago, with many more of the one-day sales," said Bill Dombrowski, vice 
president of corporate affairs for Carter, Hawley, Hale Inc., parent company of 
the Broadway. "We also tie the one-days into traditional themes, so that a 
one-day will be a white sale in January." But, he added, "The fact is, our sale 
days have been less this year than last and the long-term strategy is to become 
less reliant on the one-day sale." 
</P>
<P>
Expensive cosmetics (such as Chanel or Lancome) are rarely on sale in 
department or specialty stores, but cheaper ones can be found at a discount 
usually in late January. Department stores often have promotional give-aways of 
cosmetic products -- with the purchase of a high-priced perfume or other 
cosmetics -- near Valentine's Day, Mother's Day or before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to get a handle on coming sale trends -- one-day sales, product 
giveaways, lower everyday prices -- of most other merchandise because the 
fiercely competitive retailers guard their plans like gold at Ft. Knox. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most competitive business in the country," admitted Dombrowski. 
"We're in competition with other department stores, specialty stores, T-shirt 
stands on the corner." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traditional Sales 
</P>
<P>
Many stores, however, do have sales on specific items at the same time, year 
after year, so consumers can anticipate good buys by keeping a calendar of the 
recurring events. In addition, storewide clearances on most all items are 
offered after Christmas, Easter and the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
Most industry analysts insist that the traditional sales months are honored by 
the majority of retailers, whether they offer a month-long sale or several 
short sales during a particular month. (See accompanying chart.) 
</P>
<P>
"There's still a tremendous bunch of traditional sales," said Tomi Block of the 
National Retail Merchants Assn. in New York, the major trade organization of 
the general merchandise retail industry, which counts 45,000 member stores in 
the United States and 1,000 retail stores in 56 other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Most stores have started cutting down on the one-day sales," Block said. 
"There are the normal holiday sales, back-to-school, but fewer last-minute 
sales. Last year, there was a sale every minute, but their (store) inventories 
are a little bit leaner this year, so there aren't as many." 
</P>
<P>
Even though there were fewer sales this year nationwide, total retail sales, 
excluding automobiles, were 7.2% ahead of a year ago, as of August tallies by 
the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Sears has taken another tack, and won't have as many specialty sales in its 
nationwide stores since the company decided on March 1 "to focus on everyday 
low pricing" of items. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making prices more competitive on a daily basis so people will shop more 
often and not have to wait for sales," said Mary Jean Houde, a Sears 
representative in Chicago. "Consumer research indicated that most people would 
prefer not waiting for sales and have the lowest possible prices offered 
everyday." 
</P>
<P>
Sears also has instituted a "price pledge" to consumers, promising to meet or 
beat any other price, selling an item for the same price or less than the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
In the car market, not only are some dealers making price pledges similar to 
Sears, they're offering unbelievable rebates on their 1989 models, anywhere 
from $500 to $2,500. If there's a factory rebate included, you might be able to 
get as much as $4,000 off on certain models. (Dealers are offering rebates of 
up to $4,000 on Sterlings and $3,700 on Buick Centurys.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're making junkies out of consumers," said Dan White, manager of the 
Southern California Chrysler Plymouth Dealers Assn. "It's probably more 
confusing (to consumers) than ever. It's not like the old days anymore, when 
you had the traditional cleanup period. Cleanup time was July, August and 
September so dealers could get the '89s off the lot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breaks Direct to Consumer 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers used to offer dealers a 5% carryover allowance on current models 
when the next year's line came out. The dealer could pass on the savings to the 
consumer if he wished. But manufacturers have discontinued that practice, 
preferring instead to give rebates directly to the consumer. Today, although 
they still have 1989 models available, some dealers are already offering 
rebates on 1990 models. 
</P>
<P>
Some auto manufacturers also bring out new car lines in midyear now instead of 
on the traditional Oct. 1 date, so consumers can frequently get new car deals 
on those brands in June instead of September, White pointed out. 
</P>

"The traditional clearance time is gone forever," observed Mickey Garrett, 
executive vice president of the Greater Los Angeles Motorcar Dealers Assn. 
"Incentives and rebates are here to stay in the auto manufacturing business. . 
. . It's a consumer-driven market and it looks like it will be for many, many 
months. There are more cars being introduced everyday and the industry is 
overproducing. There's a tremendous amount of inventory." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett said he would advise consumers to do a considerable amount of price 
shopping if they are in the market for a new car. 
</P>
<P>
"People just have to look for the rebates," he explained. "If they hold off 
(buying a 1989 edition now) they'll see rebates on the new 1990 ones. Toyota, 
Nissan, Chrysler and Chevrolet are already offering them on some models. 
Consumers can get good deals now, but if they hold off 'til towards the end of 
July, 1990, they'll get even better ones."

DESIGNERS' FACTION DID L.A. ITS WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ROURKE, Fashion Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even the names suggested there could be some friction. "California Collections" 
was an amiable assortment of Los Angeles designer shows, held in daylight under 
an airy white tent. "L.A. My Way" was a fashion show with an air of defiance, 
staged at night, in a building under reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
More than the crowds, the cover-girl models imported from New York, or the 
clothes themselves, it was the tension between these two fashion factions that 
pointed to significant change during this year's spring '90 California press 
preview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Sampling of Styles 
</P>
<P>
But first the clothes. Several dozen designers presented a sampling of their 
new styles in the annual event, sponsored by the California Mart. The "My Way" 
show included three Los Angeles designers -- Andrea Vincent, Peter Cohen and 
partners Rick Beach and Patti Cappalli -- along with New Yorkers Carmelo 
Pomodoro and Patricia Clyne. It was located in, and sponsored by, the Eastern 
Columbia Building, one of several newer, downtown sites where designers rent 
showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Together, all of the shows demonstrated, after a slow progression from swimwear 
and Hollywood glamour gowns toward individualistic ready-to-wear, a strong 
group of younger designers has developed a definite foothold. 
</P>
<P>
It's as if they finally get it: Los Angeles isn't the home of exquisite 
tailoring, couture-quality fabrics and five-digit price tags. At least not in 
its contemporary market, which is the one singled out in these shows. 
</P>
<P>
At this level, fashion is all about moderately priced and spirited 
"interpretations" of New York and European styles, from the most classic to the 
most outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do the designers seem to get it, they're making the most of it. Their 
works look more wearable, and better made, in better quality fabrics, than ever 
before. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best of the Bunch 
</P>
<P>
The best of the bunch in this week's shows included Peter Cohen's styles, as 
basic as baseball jackets and T-shirts, in luxury fabrics that give them an 
attractive air of arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
Katayone Adeli brought lady-like elegance to two labels: Laundry for weekdays, 
and Ricky for weekends. The Ricky collection didn't lose in her obvious 
translation of denim and khaki looks from Donna Karan's DKNY collections. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Beach and Patti Cappalli held the lead in what once was referred to as 
"patio dressing." Their lingerie-like, black lace bustiers worn instead of 
T-shirts under tropical print pants suits were a surprising mix that looked 
right for L.A. nights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
World-Class Imports 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the famed model, Iman, a veteran of Paris and New York runways, 
wore the clothes didn't hurt. In fact, the "My Way" show in which Beach and 
Cappalli participated featured a number of top models, each imported for the 
occasion. It was the first time any of them participated in Los Angeles press 
week and it was an object lesson. A world-class model can make even the most 
ordinary outfit seem to sizzle. 
</P>
<P>
James Tarantino's meticulously finished dresses looked like classic 
architecture -- the kind that considers human needs. Cut-out shoulders, 
V-backs, oversized collars, all in sophisticated pastel shades of linen, were 
his entry. Earlier this year Tarantino won the Sil d'Argent award for 
excellence, presented in Monte Carlo where Paris superstar designer Christian 
Lacroix commended him on the quality of his work. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dozens of neo-hippie and ethnic looks Los Angeles designers showed 
for spring, Sue Wong's and Gary Roark's Moroccan and Indian styles were both 
notable. Wong used origami shades of silky jacquard, Roark used trinkets and 
tiny bells as trim. Pepito Albert's late-night wear -- especially the ivory 
unitard with net cape -- was flamboyant and fun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More to Come 
</P>
<P>
Some highly regarded designers -- Mimi Levitas-Cox for Opera, Mark Eisen, Karl 
Logan, Antony Moorcroft and Robin Piccone for Body Glove -- are nominees for 
the Mart's Designer of the Year award and will unveil their work at a separate 
show. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, the strength of the collections, and the new confidence of the 
designers, are behind this year's rift. For close to 10 years, press week has 
been sponsored and subsidized exclusively by the Mart, which is also the 
landlord to nearly all designers in the shows. 
</P>
<P>
This time, some of the best established designers (both renters and non-renters 
of Mart showroom space) wanted to stage solo shows. Others wanted to stage 
group shows during press week, but outside the auspices of the Mart. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to go against the Mart," says Yvette Crosby who produced the 
"My Way" show. She approached the Mart building owners, the Morse family, about 
staging her event under their tent but she was turned down. "There is growth in 
the Los Angeles fashion industry, and inevitably that means change," she 
maintains. 
</P>
<P>
David Morse, a partner of the Mart building, says he couldn't "sanction" 
Crosby's show because of one specific consideration -- real estate. 
</P>
<P>
"We want our own real estate to be successful," he begins. "The other event 
allowed another real estate project to put their name on it." (Crosby wanted to 
credit Barclay Associates, a group of eight investors, landlords of the Eastern 
Columbia Building, for subsidizing her show.) 
</P>
<P>
If Morse's critics have a shared complaint, it is the family's attention to 
property holdings above all else that concerns them. They worry that property 
takes priority over the growth of the city's fashion industry. 
</P>
<P>
But Morse begs to differ. "We agree with the idea of other shows. Our feeling 
is, there's a lot of room. We just want to be the umbrella." 
</P>
<P>
Next year's shows could be even more interesting.

3 CALIFORNIANS WIN LITERARY AWARDS FROM FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six contemporary authors and poets, including three Californians, have received 
awards of $35,000 each for their contributions to English language literature, 
the Lannan Foundation has announced. 
</P>
<P>
The annual Lannan Literary Awards will be presented by the foundation, an arts 
organization established in 1960 by entrepreneur, art collector, and poetry 
aficionado J. Patrick Lannan. 
</P>
<P>
The awards are given to writers whose work "fosters imaginative critical 
thinking and calls attention to essential humanistic values in creative, 
skillful and provocative ways," according to foundation literature. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Boyle, the author of more than 35 books of prose and poetry and a foreign 
correspondent for the New Yorker until she was investigated by Senator Joseph 
McCarthy's House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950's, received the 
foundation's special award for "Outstanding Literary Achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Wendell Berry, whom the late Edward Abbey called "the best essayist writing in 
America today," received the foundation's award for nonfiction. Novelist John 
Berger received the award for fiction, and poet Cid Corman, was given the award 
for poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Levitt, a Malibu poet and translator, and San Francisco poet George Evans 
each received literary fellowships.

SEATTLE'S GAY THEATER BRINGS 'ZOMBIE' TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pack up your feather boas and put away those high-heeled mules. And while 
you're at it, mothball those persnickety ideas about what kind of performance 
is right for a general audience. 
</P>
<P>
Lesbian and gay theater, you see, is not just for lesbians and gays anymore. 
That's according to Rick Rankin and Susan Finque of Seattle's Alice B. Theatre, 
who call their 6-year-old performance, dance and theater space "a gay and 
lesbian theater for all people." 
</P>
<P>
L.A. people will get to see Finque and Rankin, along with Alice B. performers 
Larry Lefler and Timothy Jones, in a triple bill called "Attack of the Zombie 
Backup Singers and Other Hits" at Highways today through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Alice B. is "for all," Finque and Rankin say, because gayness isn't the only 
topic. Moreover, their theater boasts a "one-third gay, one-third lesbian and 
one-third straight" subscriber audience whose support backs up their claims to 
inclusivity. 
</P>
<P>
Alice B. may present some radical and high-camp material, but it also employs a 
mix of styles to make the season accessible to non-gay theatergoers. 
</P>
<P>
The slogan on the front of the purple pamphlet touting the 1989-90 Alice B. 
season screams, "Afraid of gay theater? Get over it!" The flyer's offerings: a 
tribute to the AIDS quilt, a comedy about a gay man trying to live with his 
boyfriend and the First National Gay/Lesbian Theatre Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin cites composer Edvard Grieg as an analogy to explain how a gay 
sensibility doesn't leave out those who aren't gay. 
</P>
<P>
"Grieg felt the need to express Scandinavian culture. He composed national 
music, but you wouldn't say it was only for Scandinavians." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, many Alice B. productions have no obviously gay or lesbian 
orientation. "Some works we produce are obviously gay theater, what people 
typically expect from a gay theater, but some have no overtly gay content 
whatsoever," says Rankin. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel that gay theater is limited to men kissing men and women kissing 
women on stage. There may be some lesbian and gay imagery, but it's not the 
primary image," says Rankin. "Whatever gay and lesbian imagery may be in (some 
works) comes from (those images) being part of the human psyche." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not out to do kitchen-sink soap operas about gay relationships," says 
Finque, whose movement-based performance "T.S./Crossing" looks at 
female-to-male transsexuality. 
</P>
<P>
"Attack of the Zombie Backup Singers," for instance, is a play with a '50s 
sci-fi look in which aliens disguise themselves as Motown singers in order to 
infiltrate a two-bit town in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Rankin and performed by Rankin and Lefler, "Zombie" has no gay plot, 
they say. So what makes it gay theater? 
</P>
<P>
Says Rankin, "It's definitely gay theater in that I wrote it and I'm gay and 
the look comes from drag." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Finque: "The gay sensibility behind 'Zombie' is that when you're already 
an outsider in America, you perceive the society from that perspective, 
observing absurdism or prejudice in a different way. 
</P>
<P>
"You see the way the mainstream treats aliens and then you see what your place 
in that society is." 
</P>
<P>
Finque and Rankin argue that this "gay sensibility" is a way of seeing that 
colors the subject matter without excluding people who aren't gay. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're gay in a primarily straight society, the work can't help reflect 
that. Even if we do a scene about heterosexual marriage, it has a certain 
color," says Finque. 
</P>
<P>
Alice B. takes on topics as large as American history and global politics, 
albeit from a "gay perspective." The work may be political without necessarily 
focusing on gay politics. 
</P>
<P>
That openness, they say, is theater and performance's special province. 
</P>
<P>
"Theater is the first art form, after literature, to blaze a trail for society 
to look at. People hungry for great theater are hungry for change: It's where 
revolution begins," says Finque. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a focus group with our general theater audience, many of whom aren't 
gay or who aren't necessarily interested in theater," Rankin says. "Subscribers 
said, 'We don't always love what you do, but we expect it to challenge us.' " 
</P>
<P>
Challenge is the operative word all right, as with any theatrical endeavor 
nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the power of the media, anyone who does theater in the U.S. is 
tilting at windmills," says Rankin, "and people in L.A. probably understand 
that better than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"So in a way, we're not all that different."

NATIONAL FILM TREASURES RUN THE GAMUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The list of 25 films cited as national treasures by the Library of Congress 
Tuesday seems to have been careful not to favor particular genres or directors. 
John Ford, Billy Wilder and Victor Fleming had two films each on the list, 
while James Stewart and Humphrey Bogart were the only actors to have more than 
one film on the list. Seventeen of the movies were filmed in black-and-white, 
and six were silent.

the adjustments of three veterans returning home at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Casablanca, 1942. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, Rick's Cafe Americain, 
and "As Time Goes By." Everybody's late-night black-and-white favorite, already 
colorized with a disclaimer by Ted Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen Kane, 1941. Orson Welles' thinly veiled biography of publishing magnate 
William Randolph Hearst was one of the most stylistically influential films 
ever made. Welles' contract prevented Turner from colorizing it. 
</P>
<P>
The Crowd, 1928. King Vidor's silent drama about a lower-class family's 
struggle to make it in the American workplace. 
</P>
<P>

motion by directing a nuclear attack on Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The General, 1927. A silent Buster Keaton classic set against the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Gone With the Wind, 1939. The most popular film ever made, with Rhett Butler, 
Scarlett O'Hara, the burning of Atlanta, and the most famous blaspheme ever 
uttered: "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn." 
</P>
<P>
The Grapes of Wrath, 1940. John Ford's adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel 
about a Dust Bowl family's migration west during the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
High Noon, 1952. The quintessential American Western, with lone sheriff Gary 
Cooper single-handedly facing a gang of outlaws. Directed by Fred Zinnemann. 
</P>
<P>
Intolerance, 1916. D. W. Griffith's milestone -- one of the first Hollywood 
epics -- used four related stories to reveal man's inhumanity to man. 
</P>
<P>
The Learning Tree, 1969. Director Gordon Parks' autobiographical account of his 
own coming of age and coming to grips with racism as a black growing up in 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
The Maltese Falcon, 1941. John Huston's first picture, adapted from Dashiell 
Hammett's novel about San Francisco detective Sam Spade, launched a decade of 
film noir and made Humphrey Bogart a star. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, 1939. Frank Capra's other great movie (his "It's 
a Wonderful Life" did not make the list) starred James Stewart as an idealist 
who takes on corruption in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Modern Times, 1936. Charlie Chaplin's classic satire of the Machine Age was 
his, and Hollywood's, last great silent film. 
</P>
<P>
Nanook of the North, 1922. Robert Flaherty's landmark silent documentary on 
Eskimo life. 
</P>
<P>
On the Waterfront, 1954. Director Elia Kazan and writer Budd Schulberg's expose 
of stevedore racketeers, with Marlon Brando as the pug who turns against the 
mob. 
</P>
<P>
The Searchers, 1956. A relentless John Wayne seeks his kidnaped niece (Natalie 
Wood), taken by Indians, in what is regarded by critics as the best of John 
Ford's Westerns.

Stanley Donen's musical parody of the movies' transition from silents to sound. 
</P>
<P>
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, 1937. Walt Disney's first full-length cartoon 
and the only animated film to make the list. 
</P>
<P>
Some Like It Hot, 1959. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are Chicago musicians on 
the lam and in drag who join Marilyn Monroe in an all-girl band in 
writer-director Billy Wilder and co-screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond's 
black-and-white comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Star Wars, 1977. George Lucas transformed a movie genre -- and the film 
industry as well -- with this sequel-spawning Space Age Western starring 
Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, the voice of James Earl Jones and 
two lovable robots. 
</P>
<P>
Sunrise, 1927. Janet Gaynor stars as a young wife whose life is threatened by 
her husband in F. W. Murnau's silent film. 
</P>
<P>
Sunset Boulevard, 1950. Billy Wilder's bitter Hollywood satire, a flashback 
told by a dead man, is the story of a young screenwriter (William Holden) who 
is corrupted by an aging, lovelorn star (Gloria Swanson). 
</P>
<P>
Vertigo, 1958. Alfred Hitchcock's double-identity erotic thriller about a 
retired cop (James Stewart) with a fear of heights. 
</P>
<P>
The Wizard of Oz, 1939. Dorothy, Toto, Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, the Tin 
Man, and a horse of a different color. The perennial family classic.

TRUMP LENDS HIS NAME TO NEW TV GAME SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Trump, who has star billing on Manhattan real estate, New Jersey 
casinos, an airline and a board game, will lend his name to a new TV game show, 
"Trump Card." 
</P>
<P>
The daily syndicated show, the first TV venture for the wealthy developer, was 
unveiled on Tuesday at a press conference here. The show will be produced at 
the Trump Castle Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The game show -- which will combine elements of bingo, with viewers playing on 
cards at home -- was created by Lorimar Television and will be distributed by 
Warner Bros. Domestic Television. It is based on a British game show called 
"Full House." 
</P>
<P>
Although Trump might make an appearance on the program, he said that he does 
not expect to play a major creative role in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm involved in the ownership of the show. I'm not creatively involved, except 
somewhat modestly," Trump said. "What attracted me to the show were the 
statistics on its success in England and my confidence in Steve Ross," the 
Time-Warner executive who is a longtime friend of Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Although Trump would not specify the financial arrangements on the show, he 
said any profits from his portion, which he described as a "good, substantial 
stake," would be donated to charity. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot for "Trump Card" will be produced over the next four to six weeks, 
with the series to be sold to local stations for the fall season next year. 
Intended for the 7-8 p.m. time slot, the series will have among its likely 
competition "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune," two long-running game shows 
from Merv Griffin, who has been a rival to Trump in the Atlantic City hotel 
business. (Trump said at the press conference that Griffin was not a factor in 
his own entry into the game-show business.) 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to build a new game show in syndication, without prior exposure 
on a commercial network. But David Salzman, president of Lorimar Television, 
said that the producers are looking to the play-along possibilities of the 
game, plus the recognizability of Trump's name, to win initial stations and 
viewers.

SUSPECT IN EARLIER ROBBERY DIES IN ORANGE, SANTA ANA POLICE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A suspect in a children's clothing store robbery two weeks ago died early today 
after he was shot by Santa Ana police while attempting to flee, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the suspect, identified as Ernest Henry Nunez, 31, of 
Orange, was armed or threatening officers when he was shot. As is standard 
procedure in police officer shootings, the Orange County District Attorney's 
office is investigating, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at 10:02 p.m. Tuesday when Orange Police officers spotted a 
Toyota driven by a woman whose passenger was thought to be Nunez, a possible 
suspect in a Sept. 5 robbery of a Kids' Mart store in that city, Santa Ana 
Police Sgt. Art Echternacht said. Officers confirmed that the passenger was 
Nunez and requested assistance from Santa Ana police for "a felony car stop" as 
the auto entered that city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle was southbound on Harbor Boulevard and turned left onto Camille 
Street as Santa Ana and Orange police vehicles followed, Echternacht said. The 
car slowed along the curb in the residential neighborhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the car still moving, Nunez jumped out and attempted to flee, Echternacht 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The officers yelled at Nunez to stop, which he ignored," Echternacht said. "A 
single shot was fired from a shotgun by one of the Santa Ana officers, striking 
Nunez, who fell to the ground, and he was taken into custody." 
</P>
<P>
Nunez was taken to UCI Medical Center, where he underwent surgery and died 
about 3:45 a.m., Echternacht said. The officer who fired the shot was placed on 
three-day paid administrative leave, which includes psychological counseling, 
according to department policy. His name was not released.

DRAMATIC TURNOVER IN POLITBURO UNVEILED

<P>
Three members of the ruling Communist Party Politburo were dropped today in a 
dramatic consolidation of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's power. 
</P>
<P>
The most important was Vladimir Shcherbitsky, 71, a holdover from the Brezhnev 
era and the Ukraine Communist Party chief. A Politburo member since 1971, he 
was considered one of the most conservative forces on the body. 
</P>
<P>
Also retired was Viktor Chebrikov, 66, who had moved from head of the KGB in 
September to a new party position overseeing legal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The third was Viktor Nikonov, 60, who has been a Central Committee secretary 
and a Politburo member since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Chebrikov's successor as KGB chief, Vladimir Kryuchkov, was elevated to the 
Communist Party's ruling body, the Tass press agency reported at the end of a 
two-day meeting of the party's policy-making Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the state planning commission, Yuri Maslyukov, also was promoted 
from candidate to full membership in the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Two candidate members of the Politburo, Yuri Solovyev and Nikolai Talyzin, also 
were retired, Tass said. Solovyev is the Leningrad Communist Party chief. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said Gorbachev "warmly thanked" the three Politburo members for 
their "many years of fruitful activity" in the party, indicating that they were 
retiring in good graces. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of stunning changes capping a Central Committee meeting devoted to 
ethnic affairs, two candidate members of the Politburo also were named.

Residents from Florida to North Carolina stocked up on groceries, flashlights 
and window-reinforcing tape for Hurricane Hugo's expected assault, and the Navy 
sent ships to sea today to ride out the killer storm. 
</P>
<P>
Looting broke out on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands in the wake of the 
storm blamed for at least 25 deaths in the Caribbean. President Bush declared 
the islands a disaster area, and the government made available $500,000 for 
food and emergency supplies there. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the chances of the hurricane hitting the East Coast late this 
week were steadily increasing, and most projected paths had the storm hitting 
between Cape Canaveral, Fla., and Cape Hatteras, N.C., by early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Winds, Rain 
</P>
<P>
The storm today brushed northeast of the Bahamas with winds of 105 m.p.h. and 
was expected to bring mostly high wind and rain. Workers boarded up government 
buildings, and Prime Minister Lynden Pindling cut short a visit to Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo's center was located this afternoon 360 miles east of Nassau in the 
Bahamas. It was moving northwest at 12 m.p.h., a course it was expected to 
maintain through today. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at satellite pictures, the eye of the storm is coming back stronger," 
meteorologist Jim Gross said. "There might be some slight intensification. We 
don't expect it'll reach 140 m.p.h., as it was when it hit the Virgin Islands." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy today began to send ships to sea from a base at Charleston, S.C., to 
avoid storm damage. 
</P>
<P>
Looters ransacked stores and law enforcement collapsed on St. Croix, where 
tourists pleaded with reporters for help in getting out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Help Us!' 
</P>
<P>
"When we landed, we were pounced upon by about 15 tourists," said Gary 
Williams, a reporter for a San Juan newspaper. "They said, 'Please get food! 
Please get water! Please help us! They're looting. We've seen police looting. 
We've seen National Guard looting. There's no law and order here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hugo so far has left millions of dollars in damage, more than 50,000 Caribbean 
residents homeless and hundreds injured. 
</P>
<P>
In Georgia, residents stocked up on batteries, food, plywood and generators. 
Insurance companies told agents to hold up writing some types of policies until 
the storm passed. Boaters were advised to move inland. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Van Findley in Effingham County, Ga., said he was rounding up 
generators for emergency medical headquarters and shelters and arranging for 
chainsaws for use in cutting trees that may block evacuation routes. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a lot of people buying water and canned goods like pork and beans," said 
Bryan Raleigh, manager of a grocery in the Wilmington, N.C., area. "It's been 
pretty steady all morning."

POPULATION FUND VOTED AID DESPITE ABORTIONS POLICY

<P>
The Senate, on a narrow vote, moved today to reverse a 4-year-old policy and 
resume U.S. aid to the U.N. Population Fund, over objections that the fund 
supports Chinese forced-abortion policies. 
</P>
<P>
The 52-48 vote came on an amendment to a $14.4-billion foreign aid bill 
providing military, economic and development help to U.S. allies and friends 
around the globe for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The Senate still has 
to complete work on the measure, then work out differences with the House 
before sending the bill to President Bush for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers backed a provision in the bill providing $15 million to the U.N. 
population control agency, which last received U.S. money in 1985. The Ronald 
Reagan Administration shut off aid in light of charges that China has a 
one-child-per-family policy enforced through compulsory sterilization and 
abortions. Bush has continued that policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The People's Republic of China continues to engage . . . in ethically heinous, 
grievous violations of the human rights of parents" and of unborn children, 
argued Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey (R-N.H.), an abortion opponent.

President Bush and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will review Middle East 
peace prospects for the third time this year at a White House meeting on Oct. 
2, the White House said today. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who described the Egyptian leader as 
"an old and respected friend," said the session is not directly related to 
Mubarak's efforts to devise a plan for elections in the Israeli-occupied West 
Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not know the specific agenda for the talks, but added: "I'm 
sure they'll discuss the peace process."

TON OF COKE AT COLOMBIA OFFICIAL'S HOME;

U.S.-BOUND COCAINE SEIZED; 2 MORE ASSASSINATIONS IN MEDELLIN

<P>
Police announced today the discovery of more than a ton of U.S.-bound cocaine 
at the home of a local government official and reported two more assassinations 
in the hometown of the Medellin drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian authorities said they found 2,200 pounds of cocaine in cigarette 
boxes bound for the United States at the home of Pedro Rodrigeuz, a former 
council member of the Atlantic Department, of which the city of Baranquilla is 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing the discovery, Col. Luis Lopez Aponte, the region's police chief, 
said four people were arrested in the search Tuesday night and the hunt was on 
for Rodrigeuz. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure came just hours after Atty. Gen. Alfonso Gomez said that 
infiltration of the government and military by the narcotics traffickers is 
interfering with the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In Medellin, gunmen shot and killed a military intelligence officer, Lt. Cesar 
Garcia Saavedra, and veterinarian Guillermo Leon Uribe in a restaurant Tuesday 
night, the Ministry of Defense reported in Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
The killings are the latest in a string of assassinations and bombings since 
"the Extraditables," a hit squad linked to the cocaine cartels, declared "total 
war" on the nation in response to President Virgilio Barco Varga's 
reinstatement of a treaty with the United States to permit the extradition of 
drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published today, a former Brazilian official said eight of 
Colombia's 12 most-wanted drug barons are hiding in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Laercio Pellegrino, former president of Brazil's Federal Drug Council, citing 
what he said was information from the State Department, told the newspaper O 
Globo the kingpins have been trafficking from their hideout in Brazil since 
Barco launched his massive anti-drug offensive in August.

PIERCE FACES SUBPOENA IN HUD PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
EX-OFFICIAL'S LAWYERS HIT HOUSE PANEL AS 'VINDICTIVE, PUNITIVE'

<P>
A House subcommittee today voted unanimously to subpoena former Housing 
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. to testify about alleged mismanagement at his 
department. Pierce's lawyers criticized the panel as taking "vindictive and 
punitive actions." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans joined Democrats in voting to subpoena Pierce, who did not appear 
as requested last Friday to testify about reports of fraud, influence-peddling 
and mismanagement at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the subcommittee had no option," said Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), 
chairman of the employment and housing subcommittee of the Government 
Operations Committee. "The subcommittee had an agreement with Mr. Pierce. . . . 
That agreement was broken unilaterally by Mr. Pierce." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's attorney, Paul L. Perito, said before the meeting that the former 
secretary, who appeared voluntarily before the panel in May, is willing to 
testify but needs another two weeks' time for preparation. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the subcommittee's vindictive and punitive actions in denying Mr. 
Pierce adequate time to obtain and review pertinent documents and in insisting 
on use of subpoenas are taken in retaliation against Mr. Pierce's exercise of 
his constitutional right," Pierce lawyers said in a letter to Lantos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deeply Saddened' 
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply saddened that this subcommittee appears to embrace speed over 
truth," the lawyers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But Lantos and other members of the subcommittee accused Pierce of trying to 
unduly delay his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than coming forth and clearing the record . . . he is toying with the 
subcommittee in order to evade or avoid his responsibility," said Rep. Ted 
Weiss (D-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
The committee voted to approve three separate subpoenas, the first calling for 
Pierce to appear next Tuesday. Other dates were set for Oct. 27 and Nov. 3. In 
each case, the panel said the date could be changed at the discretion of 
Lantos. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos said the subpoena will be served with Pierce's attorneys as soon as it 
is formally signed later this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos said because of Pierce's actions, he no longer feels bound by their 
previous agreement to limit the scope of the subcommittee's questioning to 
three matters: Pierce's previous testimony, his actions involving a Durham, 
N.C., housing project, and the case involving DRG Corp., which conducted 
mortgage coinsurance business with HUD and left the government with huge 
defaults. 
</P>
<P>
Since Pierce appeared before the panel in May, subcommittee members say 
inconsistencies and contradictions in his testimony have emerged. While 
stopping short of accusing Pierce of committing perjury, they have suggested 
Pierce faces a formidable task in explaining his involvement in a number of 
decisions awarding HUD contracts for low-income-housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce has said he was not a "hands-on" manager.

Allergan Inc. said today two shareholder complaints naming Allergan and

SmithKline has its corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints, which also name Gavin Herbert, chairman and chief executive 
officer of Allergan, which is based in Irvine, Calif., allege that the 
companies made false statements or omitted material facts about Allergan's 
business and future prospects in connection with SmithKline's recent spinoff of 
Allergan. The actions request certification as a class action on behalf of 
certain shareholders and seek unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
Allergan said it was informed that more shareholder suits may be filed. The 
company said it denies the allegations and "will vigorously contest the 
actions."

Japan and the United States have failed to reach agreement in steel trade 
negotiations and agreed to continue talks in Washington next week, the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry said today. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions, which ended Tuesday, centered on a new annual quota for 
Japanese steel exports to the United States, starting Oct. 1, under the 
voluntary restraint arrangements, ministry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under current arrangements, due to expire at the end of this month, Japan's 
steel exports to the United States are limited to a maximum of 5.8% of U.S. 
consumption.

Michael Regner, one of East Germany's top swimming coaches, joined the exodus 
of thousands of East Germans from Hungary and fled to West Germany, the Bild 
newspaper said today. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Regner had applied for a tourist visa for Bulgaria but never 
went there. Instead, he took advantage of Hungary's new open-border policy and 
went to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Regner, 37, is one of three coaches credited with the success of East Germany's 
women swimmers, who won 14 gold medals at the European Swimming Championships 
in Bonn last month. 
</P>
<P>
More than 17,000 East Germans have arrived in West Germany since Hungary opened 
its borders last week.

Things are back to normal this year for Pat Bradley, who has rebounded from a 
disastrous 1988 to her accustomed position as one of the LPGA Tour's best 
players. 
</P>
<P>
But there's one thing wrong: Although Bradley ranks fourth on the LPGA 
money-winning list with $365,902 in earnings, she's won only one tournament 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting tired of finishing second," said Bradley, who will compete in the 
$300,000 Nippon Travel-MBS Classic starting Thursday on the 6,351-yard par-72 
Los Coyotes Country Club course. "Last year, I would have given anything to 
finish in the top 10." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, 38, played in only 17 tournaments in 1988 and earned just $15,965, 
ranking her 109th on the earnings list. It was a horrible year: She was 
hampered by a thyroid condition and her father died. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has been a standout since joining the LPGA tour in 1974. She was 14th 
on the money-winning list as a rookie, then reached the top 10 every year until 
1987, when she was 15th. 
</P>
<P>
After the fall of 1988, she's back near the top.

Veteran Indy car driver David (Salt) Walther walked away from a crash during 
testing at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Walther, a veteran of seven Indianapolis 500s, slammed into the wall between 
Turns 1 and 2 Tuesday while driving a 1986 March-Cosworth. The right side of 
the car, which had been purchased from Roger Penske, sustained extensive 
damage, including a hole in the tub, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Walther, 41, had reached speeds of 192 m.p.h. during the tests. Although he was 
limping after the accident, he declined medical attention, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Walther, who is a native of Dayton, Ohio, has not raced at Indianapolis since 
he finished 12th in 1979. This summer, he has competed as a part-time driver on 
the American Racing Series.

CANADA DRUG TEST AGENCY SOUGHT

Eighty-five days of testimony at a federal inquiry ended with harsh criticism 
for sports groups and a $2-million proposal to replace their drug-testing 
efforts with an independent agency. 
</P>
<P>
Such an agency, Sport Canada's Director General Abby Hoffman said, would 
conduct up to 3,000 random tests for performance-enhancing chemicals annually, 
more than seven times the number now conducted on Canadian athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman suggested that it would go a long way toward preventing the kind of 
scandal that surrounded sprinter Ben Johnson when he failed a drug test at the 
Seoul Olympics a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Charles Dubin questioned the wisdom of spending public money to 
create more bureaucracy instead of trying to improve the "most effective" way 
to monitor athletes: watching their daily development.

The Soviet Union proposed today that a U.N. conference on the environment in 
1992 should be held at the summit level. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky, 
referring to preparations being made for an international conference on 
environmental problems, said: "In order to give a strong push to the practical 
deeds in the field of environment . . . this international conference of 1992 
should be held at the summit level and should adopt some kind of a code of

DOW DRIFTS DOWN 3.42 ON QUIET TRADING DAY

<P>
Stock prices posted a small loss today in a drifting session. Trading was 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.42 points to 2,683.89. In the broader 
market declining issues narrowly led advances. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the big board was slow, with only 137.7 million shares trading hands. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers noted uneasiness over the market's uninspired showing Tuesday, when the 
Dow Jones industrials gave up a gain of about 10 points to finish slightly 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
That represented a sluggish response to the news that the consumer price index 
held steady in August, providing fresh encouragement on the inflation outlook. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board's "beige book" on current economic trends showed the 
nation's economy is advancing at a slow to modest rate with substantial 
regional variation. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said that report had little impact on the market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Slip 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell in early trading today in tandem with a slumping dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond slipped 3/16 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 
face amount, while its yield, which rises when prices fall, increased to 8.10% 
from 8.09% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar weakened on reports that the Group of Seven industrialized nations 
was planning stronger efforts to lower the dollar's value or put a ceiling on 
its rise. The dollar was also hurt by reports of an increase in some West 
German interest rates, which would tend to attract money to marks. 
</P>
<P>
With little else for traders to focus on, the dollar's dip drew bond prices 
lower, said Elizabeth G. Reiners, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
fell 1/8 point, intermediate maturities fell 1/16 point and long-term issues 
were down almost 1/4 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve injected reserves into the banking system, but the step was 
regarded as a technical move to relieve upward pressure on the federal funds 
rate at the end of a two-week reserve measurement period. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed stepped in when federal funds were trading at 9 3/8%, above the central 
bank's goal of around 9%. In spite of the step, the federal funds rate, which 
is the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted later at 9 1/2%, 
up from 8 7/8% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 1.95 to 1,180.11. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, which measures total return on a 
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 
0.33 to 331.86. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.02% as the discount rose 4 basis 
points to 7.76%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.11% as the discount rose 3 
basis points to 7.70%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.14% as the discount 
rose 6 basis points to 7.60%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity.
